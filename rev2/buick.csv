buick,cascada,2016,Tom in Pittsburgh, 07/31/2016,Still a Great Looker and Enjoyable to Drive,4,"I enjoy driving the car more and more each day. The ride is smooth on good roads, a bit bumpy on uneven roads (sport suspension). Our roads are hilly and windy here in Pittsburgh, but the Cascada handles the road exceptionally well. Seat and steering wheel adjustments are very accommodating. Initially I was concerned about the rear view visibility and the enclosed feeling with the roof up, but have no problems. The curvature of the two side mirrors is such that half of the lane behind me is visible in each of the side mirrors. Although the rear window is small, and is at an angle that reduce the visibility even more, between the rearwiew mirror and the two side mirrors visibility is pretty good. I have always had cars with sun roofs or panoramic roofs, so I was not sure how a solid black roof over my head will feel. I guess because of the huge wind shield and all the surrounding glass, there is absolutely no enclosed feeling. The trunk is small with the roof down, but that was expected with a convertible. It is a good size with the roof up except for the trunk opening. I am not a golfer, but I do not think that a golf bag would fit through the opening; of course there is always the back seat. In other reviews there have been a lot of comments about outdated dash, and too many buttons. True, there are a lot of buttons, but most of them are duplicates of the touch screen buttons.  Just have to get used to when to use which button, touch screen or dash. I particularly like the ""Destination"" button on the dash, it eliminates going through several menu selections for selecting destination. The other feature that I like is that you can have the navigation displayed on the small screen between the speedometer and the tachometer, leaving the main display for other things, radio, CD music track and the like. It is cleverly designed, in addition to the voice instructions the direction of the next turn is displayed as an arrow and there is a progress bar that gets smaller as you approach the turn, very good. There are numerous technological features on the Cascada that you have to pay extra for with other cars. Blind spot monitoring is not included, but there is parking assist, lane departure warning, collision prevention warning, back up camara, road following headlights, cornering lights and several other safety and convenience features. Some reviewers had issues with the collision prevention, parking assist warning and low resolution back up camera. Both of the assists worked as intended for me; I just have to remember to turn off the parking assist before going through a car wash. As for the low resolution back up camera, let's be realistic, if it shows and alerts the driver that there is an object behind the car that could possibly be hit it did it's job, hi-res is great watching movies, but a pavement?? I have had several convertibles, and they all leaked going through car washes. Now granted, cars are better built nowadays, and car washes came along way in improving how they clean a car, but my the Buick Cascada does not leak. In my opinion it is a very attractive car with the top up or with the top down. Acceleration is exceptionally good considering the weight of the car and the engine size, yes there is room for improvement, but remember you get a lot for what you spend. So far I am very pleased with my Buick Cascada. If my review is still up on the website by the time we get snow here in Pittsburgh, I will update the review on how the Cascada handles winter driving on hilly windy roads and on cold temperatures features, heater, defogger, heated steering wheel and the like. 

Updated February 12, 2020. I enjoy driving the car more and more each day. Now I have had it for almost four years without any problems. Other than the usual tire rotation, oil and oil filter replacement and other routine maintenance item, the car had no
 mechanical breakdowns or electrical faults. Unfortunately, Buick decided to not sell the Cascada here in the United States after 2019, but I can enjoy driving it till 2029 and still get parts for it if needed. I will properly maintain and keep this convertible as long possible; it has been one of the best cars that I/we have owned. It’s stylish, fast, comfortable, fun, well equipped and did not cost as much as similarly equipped convertibles. After almost four years I still get compliments on the style and color (Flip Chip Silver Metallic) of the Cascada.
The only drawback is that it is not very good in the snow using all-season tires. There are some new all-season tire designs from Nokian with unique tire thread patterns that I will try next.
Updated August 17 2020. Still no mechanical, electrical or convertible roof problems. Seems to be a change oil, filter and rotate tires type of a car. Too bad it is no longer manufactured.

buick,cascada,2016,Bobw, 05/19/2016,In its own league,4,"Bought this car for my wife (she loves it), and to be fair we have not had it but for a few weeks. I was looking for the great American convertible, something like a 1960s Buick LeSabre or Pontiac Catalina, but alas the big, roomy American verts are long gone. I was going to get a 2 series BMW (tiny back seat) or a CPO E350 (same price, 4 years old) convertible, but I went to see this car, too. Glad I did.

This car has a comfortable, adult-sized back seat, big trunk for a vert, drives well, has wonderful front seats, and looks great (blue with the cream interior). It feels solid. Despite some of the pundits' reviews, the car feels plenty quick if not sports car quick (this car is not a sports car but a cruiser, which is what I wanted). The top works like a dream and the car is very quiet with the top up. Bose stereo is solid. 

The few negatives are no memory driver's seat; the low profile 20 inch tires can be jarring on rough pavement; rearward view with the top up is poor; and it is not really an American car, despite the nameplate. Some others have complained about the gadgets in the car like nav and lane change assist, but I have an I-phone for nav (although the Buick's nav works okay) and I can drive without some electronic nanny steering my car. As far as they go, these gadgets work okay, but I do not need them or want them on this or any other car. If you want a relatively affordable convertible that looks great and makes you smile, this could be your car.

Update: Have had the car for about six months and we have loved every minute of it. Great car.

Update: The car now has 26,900 miles on it. So far we’ve had two unscheduled maintenance issues, one being a tire puncture and the other being a windshield washer motor that went out, and which was repaired under warranty. We still love the car and would recommend it.

Update: This is more of a suggestion for owners. Buick recommends a very high 35 PSI (cold) for tire pressures, presumably to enhance gas mileage. I have run the car at between 30 - 32 PSI (cold) and it makes the ride much more comfortable over rough pavement, and where I live rough pavement and potholes is the norm.

buick,cascada,2016,SydC, 03/31/2016,Classy convertible,5,"Had the Cascada for a month now and it is a joy to drive.  It has a classy design and great leather interior that is extremely well designed.  We recently went on first road trip of 1100 miles and it was great.  We encountered strong winds in New Mexico and the Cascada went straight as an arrow while other vehicles were all over the place.  We held the speed at 80 MPH and got 26 MPG which is actually pretty good considering all the headwinds.   Cascada allows the user to get extra room in the truck if the top is up by merely pressing forward the device that holds the top in the trunk.  We had lots of room for a very large suitcase and three other carry on type bags(also could easily hold a set of golf clubs in this mode).  The sound systems is top of the class and can be easily heard because the road noise is kept at a minimum on the Cascada(yes even at 80 MPH).
"
buick,cascada,2016,Scott S., 06/13/2016,Beautiful rattling tin can,2,"To date, the 2016 Cascada with 5148 miles, has been in the dealership service lane 5 times, all for the same reason.   

The convertible top is faulty.   

I initially took the car in due to a very odd knocking and popping sound coming from the rear of the vehicle.  My first dealership said it was road noise and I had to deal with it.  This was literally metal on metal banging...    After I insisted the dealer attempt to diagnose the noise concern, a technician somehow broke the interior panel but didnt tell me, nor replace the actual part.  I then received a message once again stating the knocking was just road noise and body-flex and couldnt be fixed.    After contacting Buick, I was connected to another dealership which took the time to review the knocking and found the broken panel, and also a screw that wasnt seated properly.   Drove home in complete quiet.  

Three days later...

The knocking was back and this time I had a leak on the opposite side of the car.   Back to the dealer...    They adjusted the top and replaced the seal as the dealer stated the seal had managed to fold incorrectly and formed to that shape and had to be replaced.   Further adjustments to the top and the knocking was gone again.  

A week later...

The banging and knocking is back.  The interior panel that was replaced has again disconnected and is flapping around constantly.   Adjusted, reseated, no more knocking.   

A week later...

banging is back again.    Returned to the dealer and had a technician drive the car.   After a day in the shop the technician decided to replace a guide pin for the top cover.   Noise gone again.   

3 days later...    Knocking and clacking is back, I have a leak, and the chrome trim was gouged by the service team during the last service.   Being returned to the dealer.  

At this point, the 2016 Buick Cascada has become the biggest let down / regret of my car purchasing life.   

Though the service team has been polite and helpful, I didnt buy the vehicle for it to be in service more than I am able to drive it.    Definitely regret the whole purchase at this point.

UPDATE:    12/14/2016     GM and I reached an agreement that included a buy-back of the Cascada.

buick,cascada,2016,Joe Sabin, 05/03/2016,Just What We Wanted,5,"We wanted a convertible, I wanted something fun to drive with style. I owned a Lotus Elise, but that was too small as we aged, so we were looking for something a little bit more. We looked at the Audi A3, but if it had the features of this (German company Opel) car, it cost $12K more. 

I didn't buy it to turn heads, but to be honest, it gets a significant amount of attention. Maybe not like the Lotus did, but it's a very good looking car. It's not fast, but it handles well, I love the front end suspension that handles the vagaries of the road and stops the odd bump from pulling the steering. Very nice feature. 

Overall this is a great touring car with an amazingly quiet interior even with the top and windows down. It's also got super spousal support, a moderate price, and solid overall performance. Take a look, I promise you won't be disappointed...IF you are willing to keep an open mind and realize a Buick can be pretty cool.

buick,cascada,2016,Bob Edmondson, 05/10/2016,Computer problems,5,"Buick was never able to fix the computer/electrical problems on my 2017 Buick Cascada, so they gave me a new 2018 Buick Cascada at no cost to replace it.  I am very very happy and pleased with the new vehicle and have experienced none of the problems encountered with the 2017 model.  I do wish that the car had automatic braking and blind spot detection.  Other than that, I and all my lovely grandchildren absolutely love the car.
This Buick continues to be a great car.  I live in Southern California which commonly has wonderful top down weather and many beautiful drives to take with the top down.  I also have lots of grandkids, all of whom absolutely love driving (or being driven in) the Cascada.  No mechanical problems at all.  Love it.  Exclamation point.  Was saddened to see Buick drop the Cascada, was going to buy another one within the year.

buick,cascada,2016,Rich, 05/14/2016,My Wife's New Convertible. Updated 11/19/20,4,"Our new Deep Sky Blue Cascada, purchased in March of 2016, replaces our faithful old Chrysler Sebring JXI.  My wife loves convertibles and this car is a nice one.  So far she has logged just a few hundred miles but they have been surprisingly enjoyable.  The turbo 4 has better then expected performance and the handling is crisp.  Not a floaty ride like Buick's of yore.  Much has been made of all of the buttons on the dash, but most are only used occassionally and you quickly get used to the layout.  The seats are comfortable and the convertible top, and it's mechanism, are awesome.  So far we haven't found  much not to like about this car.  Styling is extremely attractive from every angle and the car gets a lot of compliments.  At $37K, the price seems reasonable for what you get.  Our old Sebring listed at $27k when new back in 2000, and it is no where near as well equipped.  The car has some nice Euorpean touches, like the redundant set of tail lights when the trunk is open and the side signal lights on the front fenders. As for fuel economy, we recently averaged 28.6 mpg on a day trip here the DIC showed an average speed of 46 mph city/highway.  We are looking forward to enjoyable summer driving with this car.

Update:  November, 2016 -  Enjoyable summer with the Cascada.  Fun car to drive.  Current mileage is around 3,000 with no problems encountered.  Still getting a lot of positive comments.

Update: May, 2017 - Still enjoying this car.  No winter problems and no problems with the vehicle.

Update: May, 2018 - Two winters, no problems.    We still really like this car.

Update: November, 2018 - We really enjoyed our third summer with this car.  It has been totally reliable with zero problems.  My wife still gets a lot of compliments on the car.  I recently found a Cascada Owner’s Facebook page and I see many similarly happy owners worldwide.  Unfortunately it seems that 2019 may be the last year of production due to GM’s sale of Opel.

Update: November, 2019 - Right around 11,000 miles now and we are still enjoying this vehicle.  It will be four years old this coming March and still looks and rides as new.  One problem this year.  The shark fin antenna for XM radio went bad and was replaced under warranty.  Sadly production of the Cascada has ended due to the GM sale of Opel and there just are no comparable convertibles left in the marketplace.

Update:  May, 2020.   Cascada is now beyond its initial 4-year warranty but has no issues.  Still runs and looks as new after 4 Ohio winters.  No new problems encountered.  Still a very enjoyable little convertible.

Update November 2020

12,000 miles.  Didn’t drive as much this summer due to Covid restrictions.  Still enjoying this car and it still gets a lot of compliments.  Replaced the battery this month at almost 5 years old.  $220 installed by dealer.

buick,cascada,2016,Joe A., 06/30/2016,Great car once it meets potential,4,"Went to learn about cascada and test drive at Buick near me. Showroom car looked beautiful in and out. I wanted to see the trunk but it couldnn't be opened by anyone in the dealership. Trunk has no keyhole (does not use a key to open)  or open lever or switch  inside the car, the only way to open is to press a plate on trunk hood. Problem, is that the battery was dead and that wouldn't work!  Disappointed the driver seat has no memory! More consideration for back seat passenger as seat stops if knees are hit. Problem is that I don't ever have passengers in the back seat. Fake alarm system above front windshield. Was told 2017 will bring an alarm sensor for when the top is down. Liked that however Started think I should wait for next model. Hands free microphone worked ok with top down. Radio speaker quality is very poor. Top went up and down amazingly. Not having to use latches to lock the top is a great feature. Premium accessories include a windbreaker that has to be manually attached each time to avoid draft on driver/ front passenger bak and same for back seat.  Didn't like the sound of that. I didn't test it though. Really enjoyed the ride. Acceleration is ""underwhelming"" in that the downshift is slow even though it did pick up speed better than expected. Overall, I really want this car! This could very well be my next car and first convertible. But I will wait for next year's model with improvements I hope will make me want to drive right out of the show room as soon as possible.

buick,cascada,2016,Ray, 05/07/2017,"Great car, Great value",5,"Bought my 2016 Cascada convertible Sept. 2016., took it down to Fla. for the winter.I had people pulling up to me at stop lights asking what kind of car it was, they all thought it looked Great.Drove it down to Key West, what a Great drive with a convertible.It was kind of funny, we started counting Mustang convertibles on the way down, it was like every 5 or 6 cars was a mustang convertible, I think we saw 1 Cascada. The one thing I think the engineers missed, if you are driving alone with the top down, the passenger seatbelt starts banging on plastic trim once you hit around 25 miles an hour.I've looked at other convertibles and they have the belt clip up tite to the top so it is not loose to bang around.also could make Nav. System more user friendly.All in all ,Great car.
"
buick,cascada,2016,Cal, 03/20/2016,SUMMER'S AROUND THE BEND,5,"It is a very solid car.  It handles very well and holds the road/corners really well.  It is not a high performance car, so if you want one get a mustang or camaro.  The 4 cylinder turbo moves you down the road really well but your not going to use the car at a drag strip.  All the controls are there in front of you and I like that it has a key to start. I'm not a fan of start buttons, kind of brings back the 50's with the starter on the gas pedal.  Everywhere i go people are very positive about the cars looks and should bring in lots of traffic to the dealership.  It's fun to drive and that's what it should be about.  It's a great go for a drive car with the top down and on those really hot days the a/c works really well and keeps you comfortable. I now have 33,000 trouble free miles and is still a dream to drive.  Once it hits 65 degrees it's top down and out for a ride

buick,cascada,2016,Steve, 12/21/2016,It makes me smile,4,"I understood the Cascada was an Opel, introduced about 3yr ago. As such, I realized that the electronics and safety features would not match my wife's  2016 Subaru Outback with the eyesight pkg., an outstanding and versatile wagon.                                                 What the Cascada does is it makes me smile. Style, great. Handling, the HiPer Strut up front and Watt Z link rear suspension makes a taunt but comfortable ride. The top goes up and down quickly and at a reasonable speed. Economy, town about 20 mpg hwy - filled up in Dallas, two stops, cruse control @ 70, and arrived in Conway Ar. with 33mpg. Very happy. Seats, adequate. Nav., again probably 3 yrs old. Nice touches, rain sensing wipers, and heated steering wheel. The car is quiet for a convertable, and the sound system is great.                                                                                                                                                                             The car is a cruiser, and designed for a sunny day, with the top down, traveling down two lane back top roads in Arkansas,        (insert your state). It will make you smile.

At the end of a year, I still look forward to driving the Cascada. Absolutely no mechanical problems. Minor annoyances, cup holder area is too small for two full sized cups, and the device too hold either doors open is not strong enough to stop them from trying to attack my shins. Truthfully, this has been a problem with each two door car that I have owned. But......
If you are ever on I 40 in western Ark., and see the exit to the ""Pig Trail Scenic Byway"", take the top down and enjoy. I did. The eventual prize is Eurika Springs, a great destination. But the most fun is in the journey.

12/23/18. Still like the convertible very much. No mechanical problems what-so-ever. Everett Buick has done everything with a smile on their faces.   General Motors, not so much. They sold their interest in the Opel group, and there will not be a new Cascada. It has become an orphan auto. Will parts be available ?   Who knows. An Audi wasn’t that much more. But I still like the Cascada a great deal.


2/10/20.    Still runs and looks good. Absolutely no mechanical issues with the car.  Top still goes up and down with no problems, and no leaks. 
I usually park in the back 40 of the parking lot, but door dings are nasty. Our Subaru is the same age, with 5  times as many miles, parked anywhere, and no almost ding free. The Cascada’s paint may be a bit fragile. 
Planning to keep it for the long run.

8/17/20
17500 miles. Not many miles, but I still enjoy the car. No problems. Especially during the pandemic. I don’t need other people to take a spirited drive through the Ouachita mountains. Not quite like Colorado, but better suited for the car. I believe a lot of the two lane roads were laid out by a drunk goat. Great fun.

buick,cascada,2016,JC, 05/04/2016,"Gorgeous, elegant, sporty..but could use some work",5,"Update: I’ve now owned the car for two years and still love it every bit as much as the day I picked it up. My lease ends 11 months from now. No issues to speak of at this time. It’s a wonderful, beautiful car. 

Update: I've now owned the car for just a bit over a year. Still love it. 

 I just recently bought the car in Graystone Metallic with beige/black interior.  The car is extremely attractive, and I can't overstate this.

Aside from how it looks inside and out, I love the way it drives.  The handling is very impressive as it seems to hug the road tightly.  

The seats are phenomenally comfortable and well bolstered.  I find the controls are in easy reach.  The car is so quiet I can't hear it running.  The acceleration is smooth and energetic. The sound system is great.  The built-in wifi is a very nice.

I honestly couldn't be happier with the car.

buick,cascada,2016,JAC, 03/29/2016,Perfect Florida Car,5,"My wife and I had a Pontiac G6 convert and also a VW EOS. This car runs circles around them both, especially the EOS, leaks were constant under heavy rain or car wash.
The seats are very comfortable, sound system is great and everything is close to the touch.
We recently took a road trip to Naples Fl. from Tampa and got 29.8 MPG. Not bad for a car with only 300 miles on it.
We look forward to driving this car every chance we get!

buick,cascada,2016,Southern Driver, 12/03/2016,Excellent ride,5,"It is hard not to like this car.  Nice design, comfortable rise, and easy to use ragtop.  I live in the South and have lots of opportunities for top down driving.  Looking in the rearview and passenger blind side is tough but no worse than the Dodge Challenger I traded in.  Best features are the front visibility and ease of putting on and taking off the roof.  It also has a quieter ride than expected.
"
buick,cascada,2016,Billy, 08/29/2018,Love this car,5,"I like the idea of owning a convertible. Being a car guy I get that there is a trade off on that being a convertible it is going to be heavier than most comparable cars. The extra reinforcement underneath and the watts link suspension is superbly done and gives the car a quiet ride that hugs the rode well. The engine choice and transmission is going to make the car very reliable unlike other car with 8 speed transmissions etcetera on new platforms and such. As for the electronics I appreciate the extra buttons, maybe it is the techy in me but it is nice to have a redundant choice if the touch screen fails as I tend to keep cars long term. I actually want it to look like a space aged cock pit. The European influence gives it it's sexy style and when wanting an American brand the idea of blending in with the other convertible choices like the Camaro and Mustang is not that exciting. I rarely ever see another on the road. The German convertibles are great but when they break it takes to long to have parts and good luck finding someone who knows how to fix it. A well thought out car overall.
"
buick,cascada,2016,richard mckinnon, 04/25/2016,Nice Opel,3,"Visibility is very poor. Front window view is blocked by sensing equipment. Rear window visibility is about 2 feet by 10 inches. Forward collision alert is useless. It doesn't do anything? It should be stopping you, but doesn't. If I had to rely on the alert, I would have hit the object by the time I heard the alert. Same thing with Lane Departure Warning. It beeps if you drift into another lane? What is it's purpose? If there is a car then you've already hit it. I think Forward Collision and Lane Departure Alerts are a waste of money. Autonomous Cruise Control and Blind spot alert would have been a better option. There are no widow locks like there is on my Chrysler and the top down and window express down are on the console. My dogs are constantly rolling down my windows. There is very little storage space in the car. I thought my Chrysler Convertible was bad, this has 1/2 the storage. 
The engine has more power than I thought there would be. The turbo and 6 speed gives it plenty of pick up. I'm not impressed with the navigation system. The 6 year old technology on my Chrysler runs circles around the Buick. Voice recognition is useless with the top down. 
Love the Rainsense, Auto on/off headlamp control, and the climate control. Never have to touch them. Backseat pass through is great. Backseats are useless. Would have been better to make the car a 2 seater and add more storage space to the trunk.
Car handles extremely well, reminds me of my Corvette. 
Nice car, I like it, but way over priced! I own 2 convertibles and my Chrysler is a lot more car for about $11,000 less. If your buying American, forget it. The transmission is made in Mexico, engine is made in Hungary, car is built in Poland and distributed from Germany. Its an Opel with Buick emblems. The car is a Vauxhall Cascada in the UK, a Holden Cascada in Australia, an Opel  Cabrio in Spain, an Opel Cascada in the rest of Europe and a Buick Cascada in the U.S. and China. Same car different emblems. 
Overall I like it, but it needs some improvements as mentioned above.
UPDATE:
I have now had the car for several months. Tried to put the top down using the key fob as stated in the manual and as instructed by the dealer. Windows retracted, but stopped at that point and the top wouldn't go down. I took it to the dealer and they worked on it for about 2 hours. They called the manufacturer when they couldn't figure out the problem. Long story short, GM decided to not install the software until the 2017 Cascada (it is on the Canadian version). Called and complained to GM, but even though the dealer thought the software was there and the manual states it's there. GM won't fix the problem. I thought GM emerged from bankruptcy as a new and improved company. Not so, same old crappy customer service, last GM I will own.

buick,cascada,2016,Robin, 08/22/2017,Baby boomer heaven,4,"Leased 1 year ago. Love this convertible. The only things I  dislike is when I  use 3rd gear to go down a very large hill near my home. It doesn't hold well and I  need to use my brake too much. My Mazada held much better on the downhill. There is a Blindspot, as in most cars, with trim alongside front windshield.  Could use more safety features. That was the only thing I  really missed when shifting from Mazda6 to Buick Cascada. Would have loved the auto braking and also better monitoring for highway driving, even if just in the side view mirrors. Back up camera picture could be sharper images. Love the parking assist, crash warning and also the cross center line warning...this is a very good thing with distracted driving at its peak these days. All in all, I  had to have this mid sized convertible. Can't  and won't  do the little verts due to dangerous road conditions, mostly other drivers, and after driving an audi convertible, I  wanted another vert but not that price, and mid sized for sure. Love it, however, when putting other b.boomers in back....forget it. All complaints. So, save the back seat for the young agile people!  Maybe offer in a 4 door? I am very comfy and love driving this car. No complaints with filling up the trunk and popping down the back seat for more space when needed. Very simple. Went thru one new england winter, no problems,  but then i stay home in bad weather. Cold weather not an issue with rag top. Noise level also low. Had a little problem coming up my driveway,  which is a slight hill, not paved, so gets pretty slushy and icy at times. Just had to get a small head start! If I  had to drive to work daily in it and the weather was snowy, I  would be nervous driving. All in all, I  plan to trade for another when my lease expires!
"
buick,cascada,2016,Gina,RN,Awesome convertible!,5,"*update...the headlamp issue was resolved, original part was bad. I've had the car for 2 years and am still very happy with it! The passenger side seat belt does bang the inside of the door when the top is down. Easy fix, just fasten it. Instill highly recommend this convertible! *I got on here to see if there were problems posted that I'm having with mine. Everything is great in this car, comfort is top notch in these seats. They hug you and I love the lumbar support. I love that it is front wheel drive. My last car was a mustang convertible and winters in the Midwest can be very icy and snowy. I haven't had a winter yet with this car so hopefully it won't disappoint. The sound system is awesome and I can talk on Bluetooth even with top down. The passenger seat does bang on interior if not buckled when no passenger is in car. Easy enough fix. I do notice a difference with the wind guard in place. No leaks and very quiet ride with top up. My recurrent problem is AFL lamp/ headlamp leveling malfunction. The Buick dealer service dept has been awesome! They have replaced the sensor part but within 2 weeks, the warning showed up again. I took it back, which they always offer a loaner, and of course, the warning didn't show up for them. They calibrated the sensor(which had not been done when part replaced) hoping that was the problem. The warning came on the day I picked it back up(figures). I am now scheduled to take it to a closer dealer as the one I purchased it at was a little far for the frequent trips I was making. Hopefully, they figure it out. However, it is not affecting the performance of my Cascada, I just don't like having any issues on my new car. I'm over 9000 miles and am just in love with it. I get a lot of compliments which coming from an orange mustang gt convertible is surprising. You will not be disappointed!

buick,cascada,2016,Dennis Gates, 03/20/2016,incomprehensible rear end,4,"For some unknown reason, the car has double rear lights.  Two sets. Beautiful outside lights.  Then open the trunk, and there is a second set of rear lights with blinkers, and all.   This takes up a large part of the trunk space (already naturally limited by the fold down top).  I could not fit a set of golf clubs nor a suitcase because of these double lights.    WHY????   No one knew. Then one salespersons said  ""well if you are stopped on a dark highway, with trunk open to change a tire, they are a safety""  hmmmmm.   How many times in my 40 year driving career have I stopped for that?  None.  Not valid. j
I am looking to try and remove the inner rear lights.   Just a tremendous waste of trunk space.  And cost to build and what a cost to repair!!!

buick,cascada,2016,Dan Shaw, 05/12/2018,"Happy,happy!",4,"We are very happy so far with our used 2016 Cascada. It only has 2900 miles on it so we can’t judge long term reliability. It accelerates and handles great. We read some reviews that rated it low on acceleration but I think you need to see for yourself. It looks great inside and out and has pretty good electronics. One minor exception is that it does not have a built in garage door opener.

buick,cascada,2016,Colorado Dave, 07/06/2018,Very stylish convertible; very affordable luxury,5,"2020 UPDATE:  it's now July 2020 and we just got back from a one week road trip around Colorado.  We spent many hours with the top down and enjoying the cool mountain air.  Having the fold-down back seats is awesome for luggage, coolers, etc.  So easy to load/unload at the hotel with the top down!  This car is a keeper for sure!  We don't yet have 18,000 miles, so this will be a part of our family for a long, long time.
2019 UPDATE:  it's January 2019 and I still own and love this car.  Living in Colorado, we originally thought that owning a convertible wouldn't be the most practical vehicle for year-round driving.  However, there are so many mild days during the fall, winter, and spring to enjoy top-down driving - especially with the heated seats.  I have not had any mechanical problems with my Cascada and it still looks showroom new.  I have learned a few lessons, however.  Like don't leave the top down while parked under a tree on a fall afternoon … you'll come back to a car full of leaves!

I purchased my 2016 Buick Cascada in October 2017 as a pre-owned car, but it only had 5k miles and still under factory warranty.  We got an amazing deal since it was ""used"" and since it was coming into the Winter here in Colorado I think the dealer wanted to get it off the lot (who wants to buy a convertible in the Winter in Colorado?)  I've been wanting a convertible my entire life and have been obsessed with the Cascada since I saw the commercial debut during the Super Bowl.  I am extremely pleased with this car!  We recently took a 3,000 mile road trip this summer from Denver through Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Nevada, California and back.  The cabin is very comfortable for both city- and long-distance driving.  When driving long-distance with the top down, we made sure to put on plenty of sun block and I was worried about it being too hot in the summer with the top down, but we discovered that with the windows up and the air conditioner on, there was not any issue with wind or temperature.  It's so amazing driving through the mountains and cities with the top down because you get a panoramic view of everything.  It's incredible what you get to see with the top down!  I am very impressed with overall performance of this car on the highway.  It keeps pace with other cars even going up/down mountain passes.  The handling is very smooth.  Since we were on a 2-week road trip, I was concerned about luggage space, but since it was just the two of us, we folded the back seats down and had plenty of room for our luggage.  It was super convenient loading/unloading the car with the top down.  Pros:  the top goes up/down very quickly and operates with one button; great handling in both city/highway driving; love the heated leather seats for cool drives with the top down; very stylish overall and we've received many compliments - great conversation starter with other motorists (yes, we get a lot of ""that's a Buick?"" comments!).  Cons:  as others have noted, the center instrument panel is more of a ""cluster"" and can be confusing/overwhelming; the infotainment and some of the technology seems dated; gas mileage (even on the highway) is just okay but nothing special; there are no locks on the center console or glove box - while the top goes up/down quickly, it would be a nice feature to have locks on these for a little extra security when parking with the top down.  I'm so in love with this car that I don't have a problem looking past the cons!

buick,cascada,2016,Ed Curry, 08/24/2017,"Another Tin Can still rattling,rattling",1,"This car is a rattle trap. Now that that is said, I purchased mine August 2017. After 2 months  I had problems with a front speaker that started buzzing when the car started cooling down. I had taken back to the dealership for this and  a rear view mirror that was
 poorly tightened at the factory. The mirror was fixed but the speaker still buzzes on AM and Bluetooth phone conversations. The radio has a whistling interference noise when the brakes are applied.The top had started rattling on the driver side rear and that was fixed to be replaced by a rattle on the passenger side rear now. To add to that when the front pieces of the dash were removed now the plastic creaks and rattles with every bump. This car is just a nice looking Geo Metro.

22000 mile update: tires bad at 20000 bridgestone potenzas. Turbo went out at 20000 miles. Have to stuff foam in back package tray mount to quieten the ride noise. Still have the AM radio noise interference, dealer (RON CARTER OF ALVIN) can't fix, they want to stick a rubber antenna on it...yeah.

Mileage is not great for a 4 cycl turbo (my AWD Tuscon turbo gets better mileage). But a few things that aren't right, the hood paint is alligatored from bird droppings, I see another reviewer had this and thought they were water spots but its paint damage.  I have owned dozens of cars and have not had this happen even to my 1972 Buick GS 455 which had lacquer paint, don't they use clear coat? The Black paint also seems to scratch easily and for a one year old car that is garaged most of the time it looks like its a few years old already, paint finish gets an ""F"". Side of driver seat has a hole in it after one year and is worn from when I get in the car, looks like they didn't put any padding above the air bag which is probably in the side of seat will talk to Buick about these as the dealer wont do anything. The collision sensor goes off too often even for parked cars or when stopped, and the display is cheesey. Others have pointed out the annoying seat belt flapping (I buckle the belt to stop it). The passenger side window doesn't go fully up at times and bounces back down 4 inches, the dealer has ""adjusted it"" and still does it. I have had 2 Enclaves, 1 Encore and have had a Buick GS455 for 41 years doesn't Buick road test or QA these cars?"

I am still paying over 450 a month on a lease after putting over 3000 down for 36 months and I think that crazy, but it's what I wanted to drive so I did it.  I hope to maybe buy it out, we'll see.

Even if they are stand alone options this needs blind spot/cross traffic monitoring, and adding automatic emergency braking to its forward collision warning. I would gladly pay 2 to 3 thousand greenbacks more for these options.  They already have part of this on the Verano.  I will be replacing my Mustang convertible with another one, loaded with all the tech (including adaptive cruise control) available now.  If more is added in the next two or three years to the Mustang or even the Cascada (I don't need a fast sports car) I will trade.

"
buick,cascada,2016,Keep this car in production, 02/13/2020,Best all around convertible,5,"Lets start with the good.  For me price was number 1.  I bought 2016 with less than 1000 miles in 2017 for 25k.  For a convertible with an interior that is practically sky scraper sized comparatively speaking is impossible in today's market.  In comparison in 1995 I bought a new off the floor Trans Am with T tops that cost 25k.  And here we are 22 years later, in the era of 50k cars, and they are practically giving this away even at the list of 31k.  But a car is only as good at its features, so lets get into that.  Best features first.  1. Luxury car.  Even without the convertible aspect, this car looks, drives and performs like a luxury car.  You are getting the comfort and roominess of a 65k Cadillac, but with a convertible, which is unheard of.  Adjust the front seat comfortably, and a huge 300 pound plus person can get in and be wonderfully comfortable and still have room for another 300 pound plus person to sit right behind them in the back seat! For a convertible this is almost an impossible amount of room. As a result of the SUV sized rims and tires, the car sits high, like a cross over, allowing passengers ease of entry without having to stoop down to get in, or strain to get out, and at the same time giving the car a commanding presence on the road, not to be overwhelmed other large vehicles towering over it, which also puts it in the extraordinary class for a convertible.  Many people are awed by the exterior appearance because it is extremely unique from all standpoints.  It looks like a small 2 door crossover with a drop top.  Not something you see every day, in fact I have only seen 2 or 3 driving down the road since I bought the car 3 years ago, prompting people to constantly ask ""what is that"".  At night the car really come alive with sophisticated headlamps that I call smart headlamps because when you put your turn signal on, side lights will come on that will light up your objective, without blinding anyone.  Also when you are driving down an alley the lights seem to light up 100 percent more of the alley than any other vehicle I have ever driven.  It is futuristic and impressive as well as a safely plus.  Moving to the interior, at night it fully lights up in a Tron Type display of red LEDs.  Very expensive looking as well as functional.  Besides being a summer car, that opens up to allow you to enjoy life, it is also a winter car, with front wheel drive for the snow, heated seats and steering wheel, and auto start, amazing.  The feature that allows you to put the top up and down while still driving, along with the rear alert and back up camera is also very showing of a compassionately designed vehicle.  People have complained of a overly complicated dash, but once you memorize the controls, which by the way have redundancy with the touch screen, it is much better than a overly simplified dash.  The ride and handling are extremely good on smooth pavement.  It steers superbly, and would be very difficult to crash, even with a novice driver.  I have driven cheap cars and expensive cars, and the control you have over this car is beyond compare, forget what the critics say and enter the era of 2 finger driving.  Lovely.  Now the bad.  Which really isn't so bad, but definitely worth mentioning.  Front visibility is deceptive.  I guess due to the convertible aspect of the vehicle, the bars that connect the front windshield to the side windshields is thicker than average, thick enough for a person to hide in there at the correct distance.  I have almost hit several people because I could not see them for a split second while passing through those unusually thick bars, and you definitely need to retune you mind and driving to be cognizant of that.  Pot holes.  This car is not a car for pot holes or rough terrain.  It is a little too stiff for that, and drives quite badly under rough conditions.  No third seat in the
 rear.  Although this care is quite comfortable for 4 people, there is no room to spare, and a 5th passenger is out of the question.  Also note, this car can support a tow bar, but requires a special installation for the rear lighting.  Ok folks that is it. If you like comfort and convertibles and a car that very rare to see, this may be the best car ever made.

Problems with alarm/ignition (in every other car I have driven for the past, oh, 20 years, the car alarm can be turned off by inserting the key into the ignition and turning it -- not on the Cascara).  Rides like a $24,000 vehicle, yet it costs $34,000.  You must turn off the engine to open the trunk.  Just all kinds of issues that other manufacturers figured out years ago.  Wouldn't give you half what Buick is asking for this dumpster fire of a ride "

buick,cascada,2016,JFR, 03/20/2016,Not in the league of a (any model) VW EOS AT ALL!,3,"I was so excited & really wanted to like this car, but ended up buying a 2016 VW EOS ""Final Edition."" Quality of interior material is about as cheap as it gets in this price range & below (Think Pontiac Sunfire).  Now, the EOS is FAST FAST FAST! 0-60 in 5.5 seconds, faster in the Sport model due to 18"" wheels coupled with Pirelli P-Zero Nero's. Cornering is flat on the EOS, & the Hardtop/Sunroof combo (The ONLY ONE EVER MADE, Period) is much more solid, quiet, warm in cold climates than any ragtop. Great gas mileage too. Ok, this sounds like a VW EOS review, so all I can say is TEST BOTH, & YOU WILL NOTICE A HUGE DIFFERENCE! At around the same price (And MUCH less for a Used, certified EOS, this car just must be passed by!) 
I cannot justify reviewing a vehicle when at the same price there are other vehicles that are MUCH MUCH better, in just about every way! Even the Mazda Miata, albeit much smaller & for no one over 6 feet tall, BLOWS THIS AWAY BY LEAPS & BOUNDS! But, the best Convertible, Lb. for Lb., maybe ever made, is the overlooked, very well made, extremely safe & reliable (Proven) VW EOS. And, IT DOES NOT LEAK A DROP (That was the very 1st model year, since fixed with better seals)!
This Buick can best be described in total as a ""Pontiac or Chrysler Sebring Convertible redux."" But don't take my word for it, READ THE PRO'S REVIEWS!

Rear  visibility with top up is marginal with passenger headrests up, but is adequate otherwise. Fold down rear seats great. Gas mpg on new engine 27.5at prolonged 75-85 mph, 22mpg suburban travel.

In person, it’s a good looking car and big, well for a convertible. You can seat 4 adults in relative comfort or in my case, a child seat in the back. The only other convertible offering the same interior size is the Mercedes E-class, I save about $35k. No really, I bought the Cascada with incentives for $25k new. While there are a plethora of buttons reminiscent of an early 2000s Benz, you sort of get used to it. It has some premium features too, the seat belts extend to you when you close the door, the top goes up and down in record time and the trunk is huge! 13 cubic feet top up and 10 top down!  Some compacts don’t offer that much trunk space. I love the car except for the speed, it’s slow, our CRV is probably quicker.

buick,cascada,2017,EK, 11/01/2020,Not your grandmother's Buick!,5,"Recently bought a used 2017 Cascada with only 2000 miles on it.    Have been very pleasantly surprised by the drivability of this car.   Definitely is tight and handles similar to a sports car, though Buick tuned the suspension to be softer and more forgiving than your typical sports car.  Seats are a bit firm for my taste, but I drove it for 2.5 hours and they actually got more comfortable, not less comfortable, as the drive progressed.   As has been noted elsewhere, the engine is a bit slow from a dead stop, but is very quick once you get above 40 mph.

Here are my pro's:
1. High quality at a very reasonable price.
2. Extremely quiet for a convertible.
3. Excellent handling
4. Big trunk for a convertible.
5. Decent back seat for a convertible.
6. Its a Buick so you know it's reliable.

Here are my cons:
1. Rear visibility is poor with the top up.  Back window is much too small.
2. A bit sluggish from a dead stop.
3. Controls are very confusing and a bit dated.
4. No Blind Spot Detection System, which is a huge miss considering how poor its rear visibility is (see con #1 above).

Dollar for dollar, this is as good as it gets in the world of convertibles!

Interior design and quality of materials are very good.   Acceleration isn't quite up to sports car caliber, but is still very quick.  

On the downside (these are all minor): Interior is a bit tight, and rear visibility is definitely a challenge with the top up.  One final nit: the controls are fussy and really more complicated than they need to be.

Overall this car is a gem, especially when you consider the price.  Similar BMW's and Mercedes will run you $20,000 more.  Its got a great look, and is definitely not your grandmother's Buick!   I would definitely buy it again."

buick,cascada,2018,willie, 08/12/2018,Much Nicer Than They Say,4,"I just bought one of these, and regardless of the negatives that people point out, I absolutely love it. My wife loves it, and my daughter loves it. Much more room and comfort than in the BMW 4 Series we drove. So much is standard on this car. It is roomy, comfortable, and does everything I want it to do. The rear seats are actually usable for average-size people. I can fit a set of golf clubs into the trunk if I take the woods out of the bag and put the woods in the back seat. You can't put the clubs in or out with the top down, though. I put the clubs in, then lower the shield and the top. When I get to the course, I raise the top and the shield,  then remove the clubs. I love that the rear seat backs fold forward to increase the trunk space. As for being a dog, it really isn't. I used to own a Pontiac Firebird 400 4-speed back in the day, so I'm no stranger to a performance car. 0 to 60 in 8.3 seconds?  So what? I never do that, and I doubt that you do either.  I go from maybe 20/25 to 70/75 up an acceleration lane to merge on a highway, and it handles that just fine, thank you. Passing on the highway? Again, no problem. The turbo handles that with barely a touch of the gas peddle. The other knock is all the buttons on the dash. These buttons are redundant functions found in the on-screen menus. Well guess what?  When I want to do something while driving at 70 mph, I much prefer pressing  a labelled button to drilling down through on-screen menus (even though the Cascada responds to voice commands for calling, changing radio stations, etc.). And secondly, on a bright sunny day with the top down, the screen can be a little hard to see, like your cell phone in the sun. So again, give me those redundant buttons. Once you know what they do it's no big mind-boggling confusion factor like everyone seems to think. Someone did mention that with the top down and no one in the passenger seat, the passenger seat belt clip rhythmically hits the door post and it's irritating. Well it does - lol. I took care of that by putting a thin strip of self-stick furniture pad on the door post. No more noise.  My only knock is I really, really don't like red interior lighting on the dash. But I wasn't going to not buy the car for that. As for the ride, it is nowhere near as harsh as I expected with the 20-inch wheels. And finally, since I started looking for a convertible a couple of years ago, I see so many BMWs and Audis. It's nice to stand out from the crowd a bit, and everyone that sees it tells me what a beautiful car it is. Oh, sorry, one more thing: I chose the 2018 instead of the 2019 because they changed the backup camera. They went from a nice big view on the dash screen with guidelines to a tiny video in the left corner of the rear-view mirror, without the guidelines. I hated it, and it was a deal-breaker for me and my wife. So that's my 2 cents. Color me a happy camper.

Car.,5,"My wife and I have been looking for a midsize midrange convertible for years and after seeing a Cascada in a parking lot knew this was the car we wanted.  It has all the bells and whistles you’d find in a BMW, Mercedes or Audi at a fraction of the cost to purchase and maintain.  Although they’ve been discontinued as of 2019 now is the perfect time to find a newer used car with low miles for half the sticker price.  The only drawbacks are the MPG isn’t optimal and you can’t link your iPhone to the display screen, but the pros (beautiful car, tons of standard features, handles great, decent back seat / trunk space) far outweigh those two potential cons.

buick,cascada,2019,Scott, 03/06/2019,Cascada - Positively Surprising Buick Convertible,5,"Other than relatively poor road visiblity with the top up, which is just an excuse to put the top down more often, the Cascada was positively surprising. This car seats 4 comfortably, not many do. It’s fun to drive and you don’t have to pay 40, $50000 or more to own it. The insulated top prevents road noise well. The top is also simple and fast to put up or down, even while moving slowly. (Another excuse to put the top down)  And based on various rankings, it scores high in most.  It has attractive exterior lines with the top up or down and interior styling to complete a positively surprising convertible by Buick

It's a beautiful car.  I bought it for the great predicted reliability ratings.  The critics are wrong.  This is a fantastic automobile.  Buy a slightly used one to get maximum value.  I paid only $25K for one with 14K miles.  It rides and looks beautiful.  I've been afraid of GM products, but this car is the BMW without the badge, nor the expensive maintenance, or reliability worries.

buick,cascada,2019,Robin Oldfield, 05/16/2020,Cascada: well thought out design and a real Looker,5,"We have owned our 2019 Sport Touring model since October 2019 and so far it's been perfect. Even though it was originally introduced in 2013 in Europe, the styling is unique enough that it still turns heads. 
Some ""professional"" reviewers have criticized the control stack having too many buttons. Really! I sometimes wonder if many of them just copied someone else's review. It's obvious they didn't spend much time in the car because after a while the controls become intuitive. I find the buttons to be quicker but if you prefer many of the functions can also be accomplished on the touch screen, and in addition Cascada includes voice activation control.
And their criticism of the weight seems odd because it is similar, or in some cases less, than the the other convertibles in its size class: Audi A5, Mercedes-Benz C Series, and BMW 4 Series. GM added a steel x-frame to reinforce the uni-body and although this comes with a weight penalty, the result is an exceptionally rigid chassis with no cowl shake.
I've driven on some twisty bits and can attest that the steering is very responsive and handling is as good as you'll find in any front drive competitor. The tire/wheel size is the same as you find on the front of a new 911 so there's plenty of grip. 
Seats have outstanding support, just right for a cruiser, and the top is simple to operate and provides good sound and temperature insulation.

Sometimes think they are short on something to say. Mine is an 14 plate with 45k miles and looks and drives like a new car.

These chains are prone to stretching which throws a trouble code 1st or causes major engine damage. GM/Buick's solution is to re-program the on-board oil life monitor to advise owners to change oil more frequently which will not fix anything. If the vehicle is still under warranty when the chains stretch, they will be replaced with completely different part numbers.
If not under warranty you are screwed for about a $4-$5K repair.

Luckily, the trip was only 50 miles.  I called Buick and they advised me that the warranty had expired.  I took the vehicle to a local Buick dealership which could not find anything wrong with the transmission.  I then took the vehicle to another dealership and they did discover a problem with the trans.   I called customer service about this issue and was given nothing but the runaround.  After speaking to 2 ""senior service advisors"" I was still in the same spot.  The Buick is still at the dealership waiting to get repaired (about $3000).

buick,enclave,2008,fortiter, 12/16/2012,A bad investment I still want to love,3,"The Enclave is a great car and I do not like speaking ill about it, but our vehicle has been very disappointing in terms of reliability. We thankfully purchased it under warranty at 30K and it required a new power steering pump, rack and pinion, a radio, and other minor repairs all covered under warranty. Since then, several issues have come up which were not under warranty. The moonroof was leaking and require an $800+ repair for a new seal and replacement of some of the drainage channels. The heating actuator failed to the tune of $400+ in repairs. I was quoted a cost of $200 to replace the key FOB which went bad. Overall, not what I expect from a ""luxury vehicle"" in terms of quality."

GM knows this but fails to support their customer base.   They wanted new customers and got them but we are now leavaing.   In later model years it looks ike they have fixed some of the problems but I would not feel comfortable after this kind of hell.  I have had (2) transmissions (I paid for one $3200), rack n pion steering ~$1600, power steering pump ~$1200, shocks and struts at 75K miles (too early)- ~$1K, several steering related componens~$500 all within six months ($7.5K).

buick,enclave,2008,dpgull, 03/22/2013,so far so good...,5,"well dispite all the horror stories I read about a few major issues, I decided to take the plunge and buy a very well equipped 2008 CXL (everything but the folding mirrors, 110volt outlet and articulating headlights). It was a 1 owner car that was dealer maintained and I had access to all the service records.
It seems the original owner had already addressed the steering (full replacement) and strut issue, and at 80,000 miles it runs tighter and quieter than the Mercedes M Class it replaced.
Also I got an excellent price for the car well below book value.
I did purchase a 3/36,000 extended warranty through my credit union which covers all major component, so if that wave plate goes... 

Update-  I owned this car for 30 months, and put on 40,000 miles, besides normal maintenance the only 2 issues I had (throttle body and rear lift gate struts) were covered under recalls.  The cost of ownership was incredibly good.  I loved the car so much I bought a new 2015

This car looks great and handles great unlit you pull it off the lot. After about 6 months of having the car the traction control light came on in the vehicles dash board. I'm thinking this would be an easy fix but it wasn't, come to find out that this code was for the removal/replacement of the timing chain in the car. A 4,500 job at the Buick Dealership. Okay in my head I'm thinking just bought this car out right and for a pretty good price so I fixed the car. About 8 months later the the transmission went out and this was not my fault because I take care of my cars. I also have a 87 Jeep Chrokee that is still kicking till this day. The job was about 2,100 for the rebuild on the transmission. Drove the car appropriately 1yr after the transmission repair and the traction control light came back on. Took the car to the Dealership and come to find out it's the timing chain again and this time because I'm outside of the warranty the charge would be about 4,500 again. The engine and the transmission in this car has a hard time communicating...and it's in the same vehicle. This car is trash if you're thinking of getting 2008-2016 DON'T GET IT. Get a more reliable care for your family. The 3.6V is better now but it still sucks.

I have to tell you the car is a money pit. I have had 2 recalls on bought the extended warranty. In the last 12 months I have spent $2500. Last December I had it checked out and they flushed and replaced the brake fluid. Front end alignment. So now I took it in for a check for a road trip. Well I found out the master cylinder and booster on the brakes needed to be replaced. The rack and pinion steering had to be replaced, also the the timing chain cover was leaking oil into the engine and needs the gasket to be replaced, front struts and mounts need replacing and the navigation system isn't working and to fix I would have to replace the entire radio system. I needed a front end alignment after they replaced the rack and pinion, another $90. The buttons to turn the fan up or down turned green after the black peeled off. The car has never been in an accident and kept it serviced and at 44,500 kept in the garage,  it falls apart.  The air conditioning  drain hose and the roof drain hoses all need flushing due to blockage. I will never by a Buick again. The repairs costs as much as the resale value.

I see unsatisfied Enclave consumers, on these forums, that are having issues with their transmission. We brought it to the service department, expecting it was still under warranty. To our surprise it was not, due to the in service date of the vehicle. Due to this date, we had missed the warranty coverage by six months. The service department quoted us $4900 to replace the transmission.
We had a friend recommend calling GM direct and see if they had any cost assistance they could offer, let our frustration continue. I would like to cover the pain in detail, but there is not enough time. Basically after countless phone calls and two and half weeks later, I was told that they would not offer any help and per our case rep 70,000 miles for a vehicle, was a lot of miles. Imagine my shock that you could by a $50,000 vehicle and only expect to get 70,000 miles out of it. The woman who handled my case was rude and even suggested that maybe I should have bought a different brand vehicle.
I did not expect GM to absorb
the full cost, but I was hoping they would split the cost of the repair. I have owned GM vehicles for over ten years and after this experience, I am not sure I will ever buy or recommend another GM product. Any thoughts or help out there, I am open to suggestions.

Now it's 60,000 miles I have had to replace the navigation struts shocks brakes rotors and now the battery isn't charging. This vehicle is a giant Money Pit parts are expensive and there seem to be issues non-stop as soon as these hit 50,000 miles. GMC is absolutely no help with warranties or anything else I will never own another GMC.

buick,enclave,2008,falconeddy, 07/27/2012,"Nice Car, But One BIG Issue People Need To Know About",4,"There is a part in the transmission known as the 3-5-R clutch wave plate, or just the 'wave plate'. It has been discussed in depth on many forums for those of us that own an earlier GM, Lambda-designed based vehicle. Outlook, Acadia, Enclave, Traverse; not all model years are affected. The wave plate has an exceptionally high rate of failure, and we've speculated the possibly of reverse installation (it's a large toothed ring). They're covered under warranty up until 100,000 miles or 5 years. After that, you get to pay the $3000.00 (or more) bill yourself. So far, GM has refused to acknowledge the problem, but we're still trying to get them to do something about it. BEWARE OF THIS ISSUE!!!"
buick,enclave,2008,meycro, 11/29/2013,Liked The Enclave Until Transmission Failed,2,"My 2008 Enclave recently required a new transmission.
This after only 70,000 miles and several other expensive repairs.
Until recently
when people would ask me how I liked it I responded, 'I like the way it drives but it's expensive to keep running.
Now that the transmission failed, costing over $5,000 installed, I tell everyone this will be that last GM vehicle I will own.
I will probably go back to a foreign made brand.
It's a shame.

On a 200 mile trip smoke was coming out from the interior and smelled like burnt wires. Took it to the dealership several times only to have them say it is not covered by the warranty or that they cant find a problem. Now at 74000+ miles the transmission has given out. Thank God for the extended warranty. Service engine light comes on and off as it pleases. Had it serviced and the Service Stabilitrak

It has a nice ride and decent features, although it predates most of the new safety features cars have these days. I have had to sink more money into it than I think I should have, but since I owned it, I figured that was better than having to buy a new vehicle. Over the past few years I've had issues with the water pump, air conditioning, navigation system, airbag system, electrical system in general, emission systems, and, oh yeah, I had to replace the transmission. It's always had pretty bad fuel mileage, but lately it's even worse.

Guess next time I will go with a Ford, as GM and Dodge have obviously went way downhill.


Car rides better than any I've driven.
Seat comfort and features such as dual climate control, heated seats, etc. are great.
But, with under 50,000 miles on the vehicle the control buttons have lost their paint, the leather seats are terribly worn just from normal use, the rear climate control has had to be replaced due to non-functioning and is acted up again.
Also, the transmission had to be completely replaced after 40,000 miles and the rack and pinion had to be replaced.
Poor, Poor quality for $37K."

I made a huge mistake!  My car has had every seals replaced since I purchased it and barely has 60,000 miles on it.  The car has been serviced and taken care of routinely by GMC since I purchased and babied since 2008.

The engine seals went out at 30,000 miles, numerous times the airconditioning system has been fixed over and over for problems (4+ times), steering gear/drive problems, water pump seals, rear tail gate piston's replaced, leaking sunroof due to drain tubes plugging up from bad engineering, etc., etc. etc.  GMC has not taken responsibitlity for the sun roof and I will never buy another GMC product again.

Handling is quite responsive. Feels very solid and safe.  Looks great. Interior is nice. Plenty of room in all three rows. Traded in a Chrysler Town & Country that I loved. No regrets.

We wanted an AWD SUV and deduced that the quality imports had gotten out of our reach. We were really taken by the Enclave when we tested one out, so we ordered one. To our disappointment we have found that the wheels & hubs build up with snow, ice or mud which sets up an uncomfortable vibration Which can only be alleviated by washing the wheels thoroughly with a pressure washer. The Dealer tells us that this is a common issue in all the newer vehicles due to the open hub. I am suspicious that this is a run around.

Cannot open hatch in garage - too high. Remote start seldom works, took it to dealership and told me that ""electrical devices could be getting in the way"". Driver's side heat blasts on one side only; burning one foot while the other one freezes.  Seats six not seven comfortably. The pin stripe is one little stripe down the side and you have to pay an additional $700 for something that is already on the car; it wasn't negotiable.  No power when passing.  Bose sound is a joke as you hear everything on the outside of the car. I have had leaks and other issues. The Buick Enclave is attractive, but it is not sound proof as some guy blogged earlier. I have had this car for a year and trust me, I hear everything. I was told not to buy it but I thought it was so beautiful...regret everyday now.  I seriously hate driving this car."

The driving around town in moderate traffic can cause frustration with the lack of response when the gas peddle is depressed while traveling at speeds in the 25-35 mph range.  Sometimes depending on the gear you are in you may not get much of a response initially unless you really press hard.  Sometimes it will downshift and the rpms can shoot to over 5000 when all you wanted to do was go around a slightly slower car. Can be difficult at times.

The nav system is also a great feature that I found invaluable driving in unfamiliar cities. OnStar is also great, I love the personal service that you get with this.

Being a S Californian I calibrated up to 31 miles per gallon going from Beaumont Ca, to Onterio airport Ca about 50 miles. Every time the freeway: Hwy 10 was going down hill I put the car in neutral. You can't even tell when it is coasting or not! That way I save the expensive gas and it runs on regular. It has so many luxury items I have not learned them all. Move over Lexus"
buick,enclave,2008,Rob, 06/30/2008,Great car,4,"This is the first American made car that I have ever purchased.  No American cars ever interested me. I traded a 2004 Volvo XC90 for the Enclave. The Enclave is a big jump in quality especially for the price. The XC90 equipped similarly would cost $10K more. The ride is very smooth and quiet.  We bought it loaded. My daughter loves the DVD. I like OnStar, navigation system, back-up camera and power liftgate. Adults can actually sit in the 3rd row comfortably. Behind the 3rd row there is room for luggage or coolers for tailgating. The gas mileage so far (800 miles) is not as good as the Volvo. The Enclave gets 15 MPG in the city. Overall, a great value. I highly recommend it."
buick,enclave,2008,Randy , 07/01/2008,Great trip,4,"Just completed a 2700 mile trip with four adults and lots of luggage. Averaged 21 MPG for entire trip and 24 MPG interstate at 73 MPH average. Drove 1000 straight miles only stopping for breaks and gas. Never felt tired or stiff. Seating and ease of handling are exceptional. Lives up to and exceeds quiteness claims. Did not find that shifting was a problem as other owners have eluded to, it was very smooth even with numerous terrain changes. This vehicle will get 27 MPG+ at 60 MPH on a level road. This is a great car for the money. Exterior and interior styling and workmanship are outstanding. Presently have 8500 miles on vehicle. "
buick,enclave,2008,Lynne D., 06/30/2008,Just OK for me,3,"My 2008 Enclave is one year old with 23,000 miles. I waited a year to write this review so it would be more accurate. Bad things: I get 16 mpg consistantly, much less than I expected. Transmission is a constant issue. Pulling on to a highway from an on ramp into traffic is tricky as this car just doesn't have the acceleration or power needed to pull this off effortlessly. When heat/AC is on with the fan it is very loud. Moulding of the front bumper comes to a point and is very low to the ground. Watch curbs when parking! Good things: Roomy inside and we love the ""minivan"" seating arrangement where you can walk through to the third row. It looks nice and turns many heads.    "
buick,enclave,2008,Sheila, 07/08/2008,The Best Vehicle I've Ever Owned,4,"I love this vehicle. It drives very smoothly. I bought the navigation system and used it and OnStar for a recent trip to CA. The best road trip I've ever taken with the turn-by-turn directions. The seats are extremely comfortable and I have it on good authority from my family that you can actually seat 3 people in the third row without being too uncomfortable. The way the second row moves forward makes it easy for people to sit in the third row and gives ample leg room for both the second and third row. I am thrilled with my purchase. The only negative is that I'm only averaging 14.3 mpg in town, but do believe I hit the 24 mpg on the highway trip to CA. I love the diagnostic reports."
buick,enclave,2008,anre1969, 07/15/2008,I'm buying another one,4,"My Enclave saved my life! I was recently in a car accident where another vehicle hit my Enclave and totaled it. However, I was able to walk away from the accident. The Enclave absorbed most of the impact. Everyone at the body shop said this had to be one safe car for me to not have been more seriously injured. As a father of two little toddlers, I'm so glad for this vehicle and can't wait to buy another one. Not to mention that it is a beautiful car and a very smooth, comfortable ride.  "
buick,enclave,2008,David Mellard, 08/01/2008,Buick has a winner with the Enclave,4,"You will not be disappointed with this CUV. We love it!  Buick has hit a home run with the Enclave. We traded in a '01 Expedition with the same 1st and 2nd row captain chairs as the Enclave. I'm 46 and I never thought I'd own a Buick but I don't regret it at all. For the money, the seating configuration, capacity, features, performance, this is an absolute bargan.  We were closely looking at the GMC Acadia (which is great as well) but the luxury, quiet ride, looks won us over. We looked at many other brands in this segment but there were very few that could seat 7 with the dual captain chairs.  The V6 has plenty of power and transmission seems to shift smoothly for us.  Great job Buick! We are very satisfied.  GM should use this as an example to improve their bottom line."
buick,enclave,2008,Donna, 08/07/2008,Favorite Car Ever!,4,"I love my Buick Enclave. It looks great. People have said it reminds them of the much more expensive Audi. It is super comfortable inside. It's a wide car, so sometimes parking and tight turns can be challenging. I had a GMC Envoy before this, and I would estimate the mileage on the Enclave to be about 30% better. I do a lot of city driving, so I can't say what I am averaging per gallon, but it is pretty good for a SUV of this size.  Only problem I ever have is sometimes overshifting into low instead of drive, but maybe that's just me. These are great cars, and I'm seeing more and more of them on the street."
buick,enclave,2008,Deb, 08/12/2008,What a ride!,5,"I love my Enclave!  Already made one trip from Ontario to Florida with two golden retrievers and a roof rack full of stuff!  No problems. Took 6 people out and about down there on day trips, all comfortable. I too can only find the tailgate button on the keyfob while inside, is there a button? Other than on the tailgate?  Which also had to be fixed...it would power up then drop closed!  Easy fix.  Have 23,000 k's on it as we speak and I can go 740 k's on one tank.  Did I mention I love my Enclave?"
buick,enclave,2008,holly, 08/17/2008,i love my Enclave!,5,"I have owned Landrover and Toyota in the past and I traded in my Highlander hybrid for this beautiful Enclave. It sounds crazy to trade in a hybrid but the Enclave caught my eye and I fell in love. This is the most comfortable, spacious, and most beautiful interior suv I have ever owned! I just rode with a friend in her honda on a long road trip and I was so uncomfortable because the Enclave has spoiled me with its comfortable seats and space. I usually trade in a car every 2 yrs but I know I will not part with this vehicle unless it's to get a newer model. I paid well into the 40k range for my prior vehicles and didn't have the features I have with the Enclave."
buick,enclave,2008,John, 08/17/2008,Quiet and Comfortable,4,"I didn't want to rate this until I had some experience with the vehicle. Now I can still say I'm glad I bought it. I am a very tall person, so my choices of vehicles is limited, but this had plenty of head room even with the sun and separate moon roof. I hate highway noise, and this crossover makes driving pleasant, especially when taking long trips and listening to books on my MP3 through the car's system. Most of my driving is city, but after a long trip to NYC, the five adults all enjoyed the trip. Note to GM: keep working on that fuel cell."
buick,enclave,2008,Mark, 08/17/2008,Beauty is only skin deep!,3,"Transmission hesitation/performance is a glaring design issue. At times the tranny acts as it doesn't know what gear it is suppose to be in. Which negatively effects MPG. Currently gettng 14-15 city and 16-18 highway. Dealer installed software update but no help. Another update is available but told it would cost me 3-4 MPG and once installed ut can't be backed out!  Have had 9 other Buicks and loved them all. This car, once you look past its beauty is a big dissappointment. Would not recommend until GM permanently fixes the tranny issues. Dealer does acknowledge this is an issue."
buick,enclave,2008,Christine, 08/18/2008,Blind spots,4,Love the look and style of this vehicle. Gas mileage could be much better. The ride is great. Shifting is not smooth and makes it hard for a new teenage driver. Wish I would have gotten a back up camera. Never had a car with so many blind spots. But overall love this vehicle.
buick,enclave,2008,Disappointed, 08/26/2008,Bad acceleration,3,"We have been driving our Enclave for the last few months. We love the looks and many of the features. The transmission definitely has some problems. It drags and has hesitation to switch gears from 50-70 mph. Took to the dealership a couple of times and they upgraded the software but still has the same problem. Looking at internet, it appears GM knows this problem for some time! They upgraded their transmission softwares few times! But the problem is still there. Drive on the highway if you are considering buying this car. I wish we had done that!"
buick,enclave,2008,reil1970, 08/26/2008,Superb Enclave,4,The Enclave is a perfect fit to luxury and affordabilty. Buick hits the mark. This CUV is a bullseye. I love ride its quiet and responsive ride. Best of all it's just right with the pump. I would say a compact van has its real competitor.
buick,enclave,2008,Ricardo, 08/29/2008,Very Nice Vehicle,4,"Wonderful crossover, built very well. Quiet highway ride, room for 7 passengers. Rivals any foreign crossover vehicle in class with better mileage. Cruising at 75 MPH is a dream "
buick,enclave,2008,Phoebe2525, 12/19/2007,Love my Enclave,5,"Fun to drive. Roomy,comfy, full of nice surprises. Easy entrance, exit. Lots of leg, head, shoulder room in all 3 rows. Quietest ride I've ever had in a car. Actual fuel mileage so far is 18+ mpg in city driving. Love it!"
buick,enclave,2008,stan phillips, 08/29/2008,Problems with my 2008 Enclave,4,Had car in shop twice for accelaration problems. Still has not been solved. Also noise in fan motor which they have on order to replace. Mileage in city is 15 at best and on a trip 19. The trip was 1300 miles and never got above 19. 
buick,enclave,2008,Frustrated Owner TX, 08/28/2008,Faulty Transmission,3,"Bought the Enlcave as it was half the price of the Lexus and MB.  After 15,000 miles, the transmission has gone out!  The stabilitrac and ABS are creating problems. The exterior ""chrome"" around the rear lights is coming off. The A/C temp button coloring is wearing off.  Extremely frustrated.  "
buick,enclave,2008,Melissa, 09/06/2008,Multiple Issues since purchase,3,"I have had this auto for over 1 year now and have had the following issues: 1. Gas gauge working intermittently 2. Gear shift works intermittently (doesn't lock into place). 3. Driver's side window often sticks and won't open. 4. Windshield wipers stopped working this morning, but can still hear the motor mechanism working, but they won't move. 5. Traction light comes on when driving on the highway. I really love the way this auto drives when it was new.  Now that I have 19K+ miles on it, it seems to be exposing flaws and the dealership is worthless to fix things. They can't even do a decent oil change without letting all the air out of the tires (they stated the air gauge was not calibrate"
buick,enclave,2008,Jerry Metts, 09/10/2008,Love this car,5,"I have had may different vehichles and this is truly the most comfortable, well equiped I have ever had. I get 19 mpg in the city and 24 hwy. for an 8 (comfortable) passanger car, this is great. It is very comfortable and quiet. The 6 speed trans is a little different, but well worth it. I love the hands free phone, OnStar, navagation and the sound system. This is truly a must have vehicle. "
buick,enclave,2008,Adams Family, 09/08/2008,One Year Update!,4,The Enclave has been apart of our family for over a year now and we enjoy it everytime we drive it. Our white CX model with black cloth seats has been through a lot in a year and passed with flying colors. The Buick has been on several long distance road trips and returned 23 to 24 MPG with cruise set on 70-72 MPH. Except for a recall to reprogram the transmission to shift quicker we have only been to the dealer for regular oil changes. We have towed a pop-up camper to state parks and have folded all the seats down to fit a full size dresser (new in its box) in the back. Our model has the second row bench seat and we are glad we got it since our newborn and his carseat fit comfortably. 
buick,enclave,2008,Tammie, 09/13/2008,Compliments Galore,4,"I have never received so many compliments on the appearance of a vehicle. Total strangers have said to me ""You've got a really nice looking vehicle"". The ride is incredible smooth, especially for a sport utility vehicle. My kids love the interior features.  The seats are very comfortable  It is really fun to drive. The power lift gate is a wonderful feature. The tinted windows really make the interior cooler on hot days. The large windshield wipers are terrific!"
buick,enclave,2008,karnut, 09/12/2008,Not your grandpa's Buick!,4,"I have owned many cars, including , several corvettes, Fords, Honda (the worst car I ever owned), and many GM, mopars, light trucks and vans. This is my first review about a vehicle.  With out a doubt, Buick Enclave is the finest crossover ever.  Car is as smooth and quiet as any car you will find, smother, quieter  than my sons new Lexus. I am averaging 17.8mpg around town,  one small trip got 25.4mpg. High quality and attention to detail make it extra special. You should consider the back up camera as backing visibility is restricted by design.  I traded a Tahoe which I loved but I am over it. Navagation system not as good as good as Garmin. GM should build all its cars like this  "
buick,enclave,2008,chumster, 09/26/2008,Could have been a great vehicle but...,4,"I accept the fact that my Enclave might be a lemon. Camshafts, weird engine noises, minor electrical freak- outs- and that's only within the first 3 months of ownership. The design is good but build quality is very average - panels do not align well, some a crooked, etc. It does what it is designed for - haul 7-8 people, but the transmision will make you adjust your driving style to a typical Buick drivers style. Add a virtually non-existent support by GM/local dealers ( I tried a few) and you may want to think carefuly before you but it. "
buick,enclave,2008,bondguy, 10/09/2008,Great When It Doesn't Leak,3,"I have had this car since March of 2008. I love the style and the quiet ride. However, I am so thankful that I lease this vehicle and wouldn't ever think of buying one after the problems I have experienced. Once in for electrical problems after owning it for 3 months. 3 times in for leak in ceiling (water drips in through the third row overhead maplights). The car came back to me after being in the shop (3rd time for leak) last week. So far, so good. No more leaks. Mileage is worse than what GM claims averaging 19 overall highway with stop and go a lot. Beautiful driving as it is very quiet. Pickup is just okay though."
buick,enclave,2008,jbjomo, 10/17/2008,The Enclave Saved My Life!,5,Had a terrible accident but I was able to walk away from it thanks to the Enclave!  It took the brunt of the damage and it was totaled.  My insurance agent was amazed that I survived due to the condition of the outside of the vehicle.  I'm going to purchase an '09 for a replacement.
buick,enclave,2008,BN, 12/24/2007,Very Happy with our Enclave!,4,"We absolutely love our new Enclave.  Frankly, we were hesitant about purchasing a Buick, but when comparing the Enclave to the other vehicles we were considering, the Enclave won out each time.  The comfort, space, ride, look and feel of the vehicle reinforce our decision every day."
buick,enclave,2008,GCH, 11/04/2008,Audi Q7 killer!,4,"Just yesterday our Enclave was finally delivered. We had to wait a few months as we had the car imported from the US. We had driven the car during our two weeks holidays in Florida May 2008 and fell in love with it. The car drives smoothly, is silent and has a lot of space. With 3 children the Enclave is the perfect family car. Classy and not as ordinary as a BMW X5 or Audi Q7. The fun part is that the Enclave offers as much as these cars but is far cheaper. Too bad that the XM radio does not work in Europe. It uses fuel but not as much as expected. We like the seats for total 8 people and the exclusive look & feel of the Enclave. We are sure to enjoy the Enclave for a many years to come.  "
buick,enclave,2008,NorthvilleMI, 12/25/2007,GM hit a home run,4,This vehicle is outstanding - and my other car is a Honda.  The exterior styling is great.  The interior detail is top notch.  The ride is incredibly smooth and very quiet at high speeds.  Great vehicle for a night out or a family trip.  Very luxurious and good material and build quality.  This is the best vehicle I have ever driven.
buick,enclave,2008,Texas Owner, 11/15/2008,Great Crossover SUV,5,"We absolutely love this crossover. We receive many compliments on its styling. Absolutely no problem other than the transmission hesitates on occasion. There is a program change we are considering which I'm told will seem like a 50 hp boost..downside I'm told might be a lost in fuel economy (Currently 17.9 MPG in town and consistently with hard driving on the freeway 21+ MPG). We bought the factory running boards-they are very helpful for some elderly folks we transport and it really dresses up that vehicle..and they fit perfectly into the styling. Only downside, power lift hits our garage door (triggers automatic close) so we have to turn it off when we drive into the garage.  "
buick,enclave,2008,paul d , 11/19/2008,Excellent,4,"I had this vehicle one month. I love it. Great comfort, smooth. GM has a winner with this vehicle. "
buick,enclave,2008,Dan, 11/20/2008,Way to go GM! A great luxurious ride.,5,"Wanting to replace my Escalade, I looked at Mercedes, Lexus, Infiniti, Acura, & Mazda's. I then found the GM Lamda platform of which Traverse caught my eye first. I then drove the Outlook and Acadia but after I drove the Enclave I knew! It had such an incredibly smooth, quiet ride with technology only found in more expensive vechiles. After I get over the shock that I am driving a Buick (it looks so damn good for a Buick!), all else has been a fantastic experience for me. This platform should help Americians look at buying a great product from their own country again.  "
buick,enclave,2008,Jim, 11/20/2008,Enclave is great,4,This is a great riding vehicle with good space. I love the amenities and that it uses regular gas. The transmission stinks. It's always searching and you have to tromp it just to keep up with rural traffic but on the highway it's fine. Gas mileage has been 14mpg commuting and 22mpg on the highway. It is a very quiet riding vehicle though.
buick,enclave,2008,j graham, 11/25/2008,This Ain't Your Grand Pa's Buick,5,"I was a little unsure going from a Lexus RX 300, but now I can tell you I have surely traded up! It felt a little big at first, but I have come to love the looks, driveablity and functionality. It has plenty of power. I got very concerned during the high gas prices recently, but my mileage has actually improved. I have put on 10000 miles in 5 months. I get about 19 in my combo city/interstate work commute driving and about 27, yes 27 on the open highway. Also recently during the hurricane damage and recovery it has come in very handy making trips to Lowes and Home Depot. We got it fully loaded with AWD. We love all the features - lots of luxury and a sport drive."
buick,enclave,2008,Whitney, 12/26/2007,Excellent!,5,"We have had the Buick Enclave for about six months and we absolutely love it! Everything is great about it, the drive, ride, sound, gas mileage, and soo much more. This is an excellent car for family but has the luxury of a top car!"
buick,enclave,2008,erumo, 12/31/2008,"A great, but not perfect",4,"Overall a very good vehicle. I'm very glad that I overcame my bias that Buick is for grandparents. This one is definitely worth checking out when considering Lexus or BMW. My minor negatives: I'm 5'11"" and once adjusted the steering wheel almost totally obstructs the speedometer. The navigation system is hands down the worst one I've owned. It often will not recognize side roads and has poor voice prompts for upcoming turns. I find myself frequently looking at the screen when I can rely completely on voice prompts with my other vehicles. Finally, the second row captain seats are great, but a console option between them would be a welcome addition."
buick,enclave,2008,MarknMich, 01/09/2009,Buick Shmuick,3,After first month of owning this Enclave has been nothing but trouble. Since June 08 we have had two transmission software updates (tranny shifting still terrible. Acts as though it doesn't know what gear it's suppose to be in). Rear liftgate opens by itself (when car off luckily). With automatic operation turned off we still hear the lift motor engage. Heat controls stopped working twice. At times when driving all gauges read as though the car is turned off. With cruise control set at 75 MPH for nearly two hours the best MPG I get is 17. In city getting 13 MPG is a good day. Dealer is trying their best but I don't hold out for much improvement.
buick,enclave,2008,Don Millsap, 01/19/2009,Highway is great,4,"We purchase a new car about every 14 months, this is one of the best cars we've ever owned. Had no problems so far. Like the manual shifter in the mountains."
buick,enclave,2008,Dee, 01/22/2009,The older crowd still love the Buick,4,"I never thought that I would buy what was considered an old persons car, whether I was young or old.  Now, I am older, I love the Buicks. I researched a lot of cars and SUV's before making this choice. This SUV has something about its style and technology that when I drive it, not only am I sold but my family is happy with my choice.   "
buick,enclave,2008,New Buick Lover, 02/05/2009,I really love this Enclave!,4,I am very pleased with my 2008 Enclave. I have owned the vehicle for six months and I have had no problems at all. We went on a road trip in October from Arkansas to Florida with four adults and all of our luggage and there was plenty of room for everyone. The Turn by Turn Navigation was wonderful! The car is very comfortable and quiet on the road. I love the XM radio and also the fold flat third row seating. I had a Tahoe and to get the extra space in back you had to remove the seats and they were heavy! And also where were you going to put them?! The first six months have been a joy with this car! 
buick,enclave,2008,Kimberly, 02/12/2009,Excellent vehicle for Canadians,4,"This vehicle is adding years to my life. I'm comfortable and stress free in traffic. Love how quiet the ride is, the DVD system is great for the kids, great heat, tons of room, very safe on ice or in poor winter driving conditions, visibility good in front and lights are perfect for highway driving. Fuel mileage not what the old Corolla used to get, but what do you really want? You're driving something much bigger. Had to have the radio replaced at 8 000 k but no problems otherwise. Noticed a bit of a rattle in the front sunroof after 10,000k. "
buick,enclave,2008,Mr Wright, 12/28/2007,Great Ride,4,"It is extremely quiet. You will get many on-lookers. This is a great vehicle and I would recomend it highly. Small issue, could get better gas mileage"
buick,enclave,2008,Enclave Fan, 02/25/2009,Very nice for its class,4,"We bought our Enclave used with 11K miles and remaining factory warranty and have owned it for nearly 1 year. It has served us well with no problems. It is quieter and smoother riding than its relative (Acadia). Middle seats are comfortable, 3rd row comfort is exceptional. We average about 17 mpg/city, and 24/hwy, which is just as good as my 2005 Hyundai Sonata was getting prior to trade in; So pretty good for its size in my opinion. Although we love this SUV, we are looking to trade it in for a van as it lacks the convenient power sliding side doors, and the cargo space of a van. I'm in need of something more practical for 2 children."
buick,enclave,2008,Culpster, 03/04/2009,Leaky Sunroof/Roof,3,"We have a 2008 Enclave, and where as I love the basics of the car - the sunroof leaks terribly. I have taken it in three times, every time they say it is fixed and it is not. We live in Oregon, and rain happens a lot here, and this issue is really frustrating. I don't care that it is under warranty - it is a huge inconvenience and frustrations. I would not recommend buying one with a sunroof because I have now read on-line that a lot of people have the same problem. So if you want a nice car with no sunroof, I would recommend it - but with a sunroof I would not."
buick,enclave,2008,traveler, 03/25/2009,Buick Enclave - 2008 CXL AWD,4,"We have 12000 miles on our Enclave. Love the car. Traveled from Illinois to Florida and car performed beautifully.

Some visibility problems for shorter drivers. "
buick,enclave,2008,atm, 03/27/2009,Wonderful Car,4,"I received this as a Christmas present from my husband in 2007.  It is my favorite car ever.  My college age children did not like my mini-van and urged me to get a SUV.  But, this is so much better than an ordinary SUV.  It's a luxury car with SUV features.  I have driven from Pennsylvania to Texas twice and love the GPS system and XM radio and the room.  I just read where Buick has the best rating for service and I believe it.  I would recommend this car to anyone.  My children, who are 24 and 21 both have borrowed my car for road trips.  It's not just an ""old"" person's car.  They love it, too."
buick,enclave,2008,debbie, 04/27/2009,Buick Enclave,4,"I wanted a car with 3 rows of seats to hold 6 grandchildren but also wanted a nice interior for myself--enclave was perfect.

buick,enclave,2008,Tencjedd, 01/02/2008,I never thought I'd buy a Buick!,4,"This car is hands down the classiest looking large crossover/suv on the market.  Fully loaded with the 7 passenger seating this car is nicer than a Mercedes GL or R Class.  I never thought I'd buy a Buick, but after istting in this car and test driving it, we knew we had found a winner.   GM's 100K mile warranty makes ownership hassle free.  Other reviewers have mentioned it, the car would benefit from more power, but then again, gas isn't going back to $2/gallon anytime soon, and for around town there's plenty of power.  How many people are going to drag race with this car anyway.  Second row bucket seats make 3rd row access easier, and really make this a hands down winner it its class!  "
buick,enclave,2008,Willie Wonka, 01/05/2008,Big Value in Luxury X-overs,4,"My wife is a die hard Lexus RX 330 fan, but fell in love with the Buick Enclave. It's roomy, beautiful,and loaded with all the features anyone could want and you don't need to take out a mortgage to own it!   My neighbor commented that the interior is just like a cockpit of a small jet (and he didn't read the promotional add!). For performance, styling and handling,this car is at the head of its class. I love it."

Went to a dealer the day before and they sold the one I wanted an hour before I got there. Managed to locate one the next day and bought it. I love it. I've always been a Honda buyer so this is my first American car for a while. This is definitely my red jewel.  It's gorgeous, and fun to drive and so very smooth.  Plus the family love all the options we got with the DVD play XM radio etc.  "

Everyone likes the design of the exterior and interior as much as I do.  I love almost everything about the car with the exception of the following things. Why arn't heated seats in the rear available? They are in some of the other SUV's that GM makes, but on this car they are missing.  I wanted all options, but when the car arrived it didn't have the luggage rack cross bars I bought and paid for.  The running boards were also paid for and the dealer can't tell me when the delivery date might be. The sales information states the the rear headphones come with option 3, but I now find out that isn't true. "
buick,enclave,2008,Bert, 01/13/2008,One of GM's best in many years,4,"This Enclave is the 27th vehicle I have owned, the great majority being GM brands.  I had about given up on GM for my next vehicle until I saw the Enclave at the Phoenix Auto Show.  I purchased one two weeks later and love it.  The quality is exceptional and the styling and performance leave nothing to be desired.  "
buick,enclave,2008,Mike, 01/20/2008,GM finally has a real winner,4,"My wife and I are both very picky when it comes to cars and we usually only stick with imports that have high reliability ratings. A little over two years ago, we wouldn't have even considered Buick (or any GM for that matter) when we wanted to look for a new SUV, but when I saw the Enclave revealed at the Detroit Auto Show back in 06, I immediately liked it's styling. My biggest complaint with U.S. auto makers over the last 20 years or so is primarily not build quality (although it has been relatively poor), but design. The Enclave's design is what did it for me. We absolutely love the Enclave. I dont regret it for one second."
buick,enclave,2008,Gayle, 01/20/2008,Love new Enclave,4,"I have owned my new '08 Buick Enclave, CXL AWD, less than a week and so far I love it.  I live in a rural community and everywhere I go is a trip (an hour to the nearest Wal-Mart)and the comfort of the Enclave is wonderful.  It has a quite smooth stable ride and is easy to handle. For me, all the controls are easy to use and within my reach.  "
buick,enclave,2008,Dell, 01/21/2008,The Best In Its Class,5,"I have owned several vehicles over the years that were regular sedans. However, I needed an SUV so I tried the GMC Envoy and GMC Yukon. Both were okay, but I wanted the luxury I was use to. I test drove a Lincoln Navigator and Lexus RX. Then I drove the Buick Enclave and I was sold. I never considered a Buick. I suppose because it they were, as the old saying goes, your fathers car. However, Buick has distanced itself from that saying with the Enclave. The cars that I have owned were simply transportation to me. I did not consider them fun to drive. There have only been two cars that I really enjoyed driving. They were a Lexus LS and Lincoln Town Car. However, now I can add the Buick Enclave"
buick,enclave,2008,ramo, 01/21/2008,Disgruntled,2,"This is my second GM car in the past 5 years, 20 previous were imports. I traded the first one for this Enclave after two transmissions over 65000 miles and like a fool bought another one! I have a loaded White Diamond and it is now in the shop for the 4th time in 6 weeks with same problem, the emission light continues to come on. Needless to say, the performance suffers immensely when this occurs. They have yet to figure out what is wrong. Sensors have been replaced, not sure what they are doing at this point. Can you say ""lemon law"". The car really is a nice car, when it is not in the shop! Perhaps I am just not meant to own an American made automobile. I have learned my lesson."
buick,enclave,2008,Needles, 01/24/2008,Buick Enclave,4,"Excellent vehicle, fun to drive. Good acceleration for a crossover.  Quiet smooth ride.  Plenty of extra features, XM, backup camera, etc."
buick,enclave,2008,Bruce, 07/23/2009,never again,3,"This vehicle is quite comfortable to drive and that is where my satisfaction ends. It has been back to the dealership many times for numerous problems.As of tonight you can't even shut the car off. We are driving a loaner. Had to get the jack out of the car and you need an engineering degree to do that. Would never want to have to use it along the road. Degree sensor problems, navigation problems transmission not shifting properly. If this is the kind of quality that you get for a vehicle this expensive it is no wonder General Motors is in the position they are. This is my last G.M. I guess it's Ford of Toyota from here on out"
buick,enclave,2008,Packer FAn, 08/23/2009,Smooth quiet ride,5,Took awhile to get used to the six speed transmission but I now love the car. We have taken two long trips (12000 miles)and fell in love with the car.  Very quiet compared to the GMC and Saturn versions just great to drive on the freeway at high speeds...sticks to the road and very smooth..better than any Cadillac I ever owned
buick,enclave,2008,Mark, 09/08/2009,Best Reason To Drive American-Made,5,I have 25000 miles on my enclave and haven't had any major issues with my vehicle.  On the highway at 50-55 mph I have easily gotten 30 mpg or better with the cruise on. At 60-65 mph with the cruise on I get about 29 mph. The on-star service eliminates my need for a navigation unit.  I fill my tank every 9 days. The sunroof problem was easily fixed in one visit and I have had no more leaks. It turned heads the same day I purchased it and folk continue to drive up beside me and ask about it along with expressing how much they want one. Stick with the routine maintenance and chances are your buick will be on the road for a long time.
buick,enclave,2008,KPH, 09/16/2009,Very good car,4,"My wife and I find this to be a very good car.  It is roomy, comfortable, and classy-looking. I can't understand why certain consumer magazines don't give this a thumbs up.  I liked the fact that someone from the GM shop floor rang me to see how I liked it.  This is a great American car - we're proud to have it.  "
buick,enclave,2008,GoPhillies, 09/15/2009,We Are Really Enjoying This Vehicle!,4,"Waited until we had owned for a year before writing a review.  Our Enclave is the nicest vehicle I've ever owned.  My first American car ('75 Chevy Monte Carlo) was also my last because it was junk.  Bought my first import new ('87 Honda Accord), have disparaged American cars since.  Then I had the Enclave Experience.  What a great American car!  I was actually proud to be able to buy and recommend an American car.  We use it primarily for long trips, and have spent 10 hours on the road in absolute comfort.  We have small kids and the entertainment system (Bose, w/satellite and DVD) keeps everyone happy.  Six adults fit easily.  It's beautiful, and even strangers complement it.  Get one."
buick,enclave,2008,Tyler, 09/16/2009,solid car,4,Great car. We have had the car for 18 months now and have been very satisfied with everything except the rear visibility.  Unfortunately the blind spot to the rear on both the passenger and drivers side make it a little nerve racking to drive in traffic.  The DVD monitor also blocks the Rearview mirror
buick,enclave,2008,KWD, 10/02/2009,So far so good,4,We bought our Enclave a little over two weeks ago. We are very satisfied with our purchase. The vehice interior is very luxury. The outside vehicle design is very appealling.
buick,enclave,2008,1998 Buick Enclave, 11/15/2009,Very dissapointed downshift/ time repair,2,"We bought the car without test driving. Dumb,dumb,dumb.  I drive the Enclave primarily in town and I am so disgusted with the constant downshift.  I feel like I am on a bumber ride at times.  The exterior is beautiful and interior nice but lots of trouble with gadgets that have had to be repaired under warranty.  Too many to mention. This is a total pain to drive into Madison, get a rental car and then back again to pick it up.  I am finding scary stuff again with the starter not turning over right away and one time almost hitting a car in front of me at 45 Miles per hour because the downshift became stuck and I had to hit my breaks as a quick reaction.  It was freaky!  The 1998 was mistake!"
buick,enclave,2008,SAM, 11/21/2009,Acceptable SUV,3,"I leased this vehicle to replace a Lexus RX 330.  With 2 babies on boards I needed a 3 rows Luxury SUV with decent fuel economy. PROS: Any SUV of that size has a V8. The Enclave has A V6 with decent performance and fuel economy (for the size/weight). It is beautiful inside and out. Very comfortable ride and minimal road noise. CONS: Questionable build quality and reliability.  I have already been to the dealer for serious repairs multiple times. I do not trust what the dealer did to repair the car.  Thank God it is just a lease. My brother just visit me and immediately notice how the SUV is falling apart. On the other hand, 3 years ago, he though my 4 year old Lexus was almost brand new."
buick,enclave,2008,darrenjonesoc, 11/23/2009,"Great Looking, But Not Reliable",3,"We love the look of our Enclave and the interior is versatile and attractive and comfortable.  However, the car is very unreliable!  Our engine had been dropped three times (we only have 28,000 miles) for major repairs.  We have been without the car a total of 2 months out of the 24 we have owned it.  A number of smaller issues have emerged that are annoying (seat tracks falling apart, exterior apliques falling off in the wind, sensors failing, etc.).  I hate to say it, but Consumer Reports is right, GM cars are not reliable.  That is a shame, because if the car were well built and reliable, I would love it.  "
buick,enclave,2008,Steve Cone, 12/02/2009,GM Enclave Service stinks for us,4,"Bought an Enclave in 2001.  Our mileage very much exceeded warranty mileage.  So when the entire amp in the car shorted out, they used mileage as an excuse to deny warranty claim, and dumped the cost to replace a defective amp on us, the consumers.  It was a defective amp.  They should make the amp vendor suffer the loss.  After a Suburban, two Tahoes and this Enclave, it's HONDA for me from now on."
buick,enclave,2008,JIM, 01/05/2010,Great Vehicle,5,"This is a great vehicle, and I have recommended it to several people. "
buick,enclave,2008,Bill Bauerle, 01/08/2010,Lemon or Bad Luck,4,"Bought when 1st out. Love the style, ride, and comfort.  6 sp transmission downshifts too much.  Tires (mich) wore unevenly.  Paid for alignment at 30000.  All four wheels significantly out even though it drove normally.  At 40000, #5 cylinder misfires intermittently, shuts down auto track.  Can't seem to find the cause.  Even with new car bugs, it is a great vehicle.  Have your alignment checked prior to 5000 miles (all wheels), warranty will cover it then.  Good mpg for this size, 22-27 highway.  A little more engine torque would eliminate annoying transmission downshifting.  Excellent trim and fit. Needs a locking gas cap door."
buick,enclave,2008,sojac, 01/27/2010,08 Enclave,4,"Very comfortable ride on hwy. Love the 2nd row bucket seats for adults or our two car seats.  Gives acces to third row w/o taking out a car seat.  Great storage space, great sound system. Still gets lots of looks at stop lights. Use of the manual shift option gives much better performance. 10,000 + miles and no problems."
buick,enclave,2008,Connie, 01/29/2008,I love this Enclave!,5,"I bought this vehicle 2 months ago and l. With 3 boys and all their friends, it has enough room for eveyone. It is sporty yet elegant. You get noticed in this car. I have yet to see another one. It handles great and for a 6cyl, it has the power. I wanted to purchase the 2nd row console, but nobody can tell me when it will be available. This car is very comfortable and quiet. I shopped around for months before I found something I love. My kids love the DVD player. My husband loves the telescopic steering wheel. I would recommend this car to anyone. I have a hard time seeing at night, the headlights light up everything. "

Quieter than all of the previous cars, comfortable and great use of space. Incredible amount of space considering exterior dimensions. This is the first car I've ever owned that I will buy another of the same type."
buick,enclave,2008,OnE, 05/15/2010,Electronic Problems,3,"During our purchase of our 2008  used Enclave from Gene Messer Ford. The vehicle had several electrical problems that the dealer said was normal and we could pay to have it fixed. Electric window did not operate, electric seat motors were non functional, and the water pump went out right after we got it. Granted it was used with 60000 miles. One would expect the electronics and water pump to at least hit the 100000 mark. I have also noticed some other electrical problems. When the waterpump went out the vehicle gave an overtemp warning and the display showed ""shut off engine"". We immediately did. Something killed the battery and this made key be locked in the ignition. Sounds like a pro-thef"
buick,enclave,2008,Carol, 05/23/2010,Worst car I ever owned,2,"Bought this 2008 Enclave as a Certified Preowned vehicle.  Had 51,000 miles at purchase.  So far the air conditioner sensor, transmission & Tire sensor have had to be replaced and there was some sort of electrical short that had to be fixed.  Gas mileage is about 10 in the city and about 18 on the road.  Much less than advertised.  They loaned me another 2008 Enclave to drive on vacation because mine was in the shop and the water pump went out in it.  Transmission doesn't shift well in low speeds.  RPM runs too high.  Worst car I ever bought."
buick,enclave,2008,bob, 06/11/2010,Tire replacement,4,My tires wore prematurely 3/32 at 26k miles dealer offered to buy two and I pay for two 618.00 for two tires so much for G M price matching 208.00 at Belle tire. My question is when I drove it in the dealership my vehicle drove beautifully when I drove out on a test drive it vibrated terribly it has been back six times and still not right. Last visit I was told to drive it 500 miles and come back. Can anybody help I don't have the time and they have driven it 300 miles testing it what is wrong? Thanks  help
buick,enclave,2008,mhammel, 06/29/2010,Nice. But.,3,"The Enclave provides a decent ride and comfortable seating for 7 in our configuration. If this vehicle were manufactured by Ford , I'd buy another one. The GM experience is awful (and I mean GM, not just the dealer network).  For instance, I purchased a very small, boat and wanted to add a trailer hitch. The owners manual indicates that a part has to be changed if a hitch is added and the dealer will take care of it.. Not so. The small part is a the entire fuse panel and to correctly modify the electronics in this car to support  towing is so expensive the dealer wouldn't give me a price -there's even a TSB for this but GM has canceled the TSB. OnStar with Bell - no more, gone and more."
buick,enclave,2008,Bing, 06/29/2010,Love My Buick,4,"My Buick Enclave is best riding vehicle that I have ever had.  The Enclave rides so smooth on the Interstate.  I like all of the safety features standard on the Enclave.  People ask me if I like my Enclave, I tell them no I love my Enclave.  Gas mileage in cit could be much better."

I took that advise & it was right on.  I'm about 5'5"" and my complaint is the visor doesn't block the sun when it is on the Driver's side.  Lethargic pick- up is my other complaint. There is a 'lag' when slowing down and then gaining acceleration to pass another car.  Also a little thing but important to a woman is the hook on the back of the driver's seat is useless.    "
buick,enclave,2008,Doug G, 08/05/2010,I used to be a GM Fan.,3,"Mine was preowned but practically new when I got it. Great looks and design concept, but disappointing quality. The gears stripped out in the power seat control and was replaced (I'm not Fat); The entire steering column was replaced to eliminate a persistent knocking; There is a constant rubber- on-rubber squeak when you turn the steering wheel, which the dealer tells me he has brand new Enclaves with the same problem and Buick has no fix; a water pump went out last month; in cold weather the front end cracks and pops and sounds like the FWD drive train and suspension is flying apart; drips oil.  Generally speaking, it's looks good and is comfortable, but is a typical, poorly built U.S. car"
buick,enclave,2008,donald longest, 09/18/2010,Buick Enclave,4,This is a great vehicle. The only things to improve is the small rear window and needs more Hp 
buick,enclave,2008,SunShine, 09/21/2010,Serious Reliability Issues,2,"I wanted to love this car because it has the features that I needed, and it is my first American built car.  Unfortunately, this car has had terrible reliability.  The transmission had to be replaced, several rattle and motor sounds had to be fixed, the air conditioner had to be fixed twice already and it still doesn't work, and I just had to be towed, one week after my 50,000 maintenance, because of brake issues. I was on my way to taking my daughter to the hospital!  I  seriously regret purchasing this car."
buick,enclave,2008,Dr. D, 10/12/2010,in the shop 17 times!,3,"I have had numerous problems with my Enclave. It has been in the shop 17 times, towed 4 times and been jumped 3 times. I first had the battery replaced w/in 8 months of ownership and it has been downhill since. The odometer malfunctioned, water pump replaced in the 2nd year and the transmission was replaced after 2 years. The car has leaked, trunk malfunctioned, On Star was repaired and though I know I am leaving out things, you get the gist of my experience. The time spent and money wasted on car rentals is beyond acceptable. The only positive in my Buick experience is that the service center staff were wonderful and empathic; Kim went out of her way to help me out. Buyer beware!"
buick,enclave,2008,wilson, 10/17/2010,Regret Purchase,2,I really regret purchasing my Buick Enclave.  This is the first time I have purchased a Buick and it will be the last!  Had to have transmission fixed.  It took 3 weeks.  Now having the same problem.  When driving the car suddenly downshifts and I go from 65mph to 45mph and can not do anything about it.  The last time I lost all power steering.  Very dangerous when it happens on the highway.  My car is at the dealership right now and I do not want it back!
buick,enclave,2008,OK Enclave lover, 02/02/2008,"Quiet, attractive, attention getter",4,"This car is very quiet.  It's like stepping into a bank vault.  Several people have stopped us and asked what the vehicle is. They like the chrome. I particularly like the remote start feature and the power lift gate. Mileage has disappointed so far, but isn't a major drawback. The shifting is not noticeable at all.  This is an incredible car. It's nice to see it being driven by young adults. It certainly is an affordable alternative to higher priced suburbans or other traditional suv's."
buick,enclave,2008,Micki Clevenger, 02/09/2008,Leaky Enclave,3,Looks good and feels good.  The bells and whistles could be better quality.  Not enough power. Transmission seems to have problems finding gears.  My check engine light has come on 3 times. Most frustrating is the car leaks when it rains!  the car is now rusting inside from it.  the car has been in for service 3 times and they still have not fixed it right.
buick,enclave,2008,mary, 02/10/2008,Enclave,4,"I love my Enclave!  It rides so smooth, handling great in the snow. I was hopeing for a little better gas milage, averages 16/17, 20max on highway. The interior is sharp w/wood grain and leather seats. I did get the DVD/Nav combo and use the Navigation daily w/my job. This vehicle is very roomy, I have space in the back to store items and also seating for 7. Do wish the 2nd row of seats could be adjusted front and back to give the back seat passangers more leg room if needed.  "
buick,enclave,2008,Cindy, 02/12/2008,I love this SUV!,4,"This is my first GM product since 1989. I actually read about the Saturn Outlook first, but fell for the Enclave the minute I test drove it.  It is very roomy inside, but doesn't feel like a moose to maneuver around town."
buick,enclave,2008,Keith, 02/12/2008,The Gold Standard of Crossovers!,4,"We bought our Gold Mist CXL about a month ago (this is the third Enclave in our neighborhood) and my wife and kids love it! The ride quality and quietness of the vehicle is far superior than our Sienna we traded in. Had an ice storm last night and my wife made it home without any problems and we only have FWD. We love the backup camera and park assist which is great considering the small window in the back. Overall, this is an excellent vehicle that meets our luxury requirements with interior room similiar to a minivan. Only negative is the ""less than ideal"" gas mileage - we are getting 14 MPG city. "
buick,enclave,2008,mandy, 02/14/2008,Best crossover out there!,5,I've had my Enclave a little over a month now and I love it! I spent six months testing different makes of suvs and crossovers and the Enclave is in a class of it's own! It was love at first sight! Such a smooth and quiet ride and the interior is so spacious and elegant! The exterior is unique and hands down the best looking crossover on the road today! I have to say that Buick has outdone themselves!  
buick,enclave,2008,snoop, 02/21/2008,Buy American...Toy/Honda are vanilla.,4,"Toyota and Honda are not the best in this market.  I looked at the Lexus and the Accura and they did not provide the same number of benefits to justify their added costs.  I really like the styling of the Buick much better than it's competitors. As far as the power is concerned. It is more than enough. It is a crossover vehicle not a sprint car. If you hate minivans, but want enough room for your family with all the modern creature comforts like xenon lights, nav, 2 dvds, xm leather, 2 sunroofs, in a really solid vehicle. I feel the Buick is the best choice. I am only 40 something, I didn't think I would ever own a Buick. Friends, neighbors can't believe how nice this car is!"
buick,enclave,2008,sharronh, 02/23/2008,2008 Buick Enclave CXL,5,I love love love the Enclave. Mine is the CXL fully loaded. Black with cashmere interior. Other people sure do a lot of staring. It is just beyond classy. My first experience from November to February was frustrating because the engine light kept coming on. As of yesterday Feb.22nd problem has been resolved. I'm a first time buyer with GM and consider it a great move.

We traded in our 2005 Tahoe for the Enclave, and love how it is easier to load the little ones, the only difference is when you are wanting to get up to speed it seems to hessitate, I guess I was just used to the V8, but enjoy not spending $80 in gas every week. "
buick,enclave,2008,BillyG, 05/18/2007,CXL,4,"Most quiet/comfortable vehicle have ever owned.  Looking forward to long trip. Gold Mist Metallic is an awesome color. Mileage on par with an Acura MDX, Lexus 350 without premium fuel. Put those marques on this vehicle and they would be proud."
buick,enclave,2008,EMG, 06/10/2007,Fantastic first week!,5,"Just got our new Enclave and couldn't be happier. Had many more ""bells and whistles"" than we even knew about going in!  Such a quiet ride, very solid feel. Decent pick-up on the freeway, but it's not a sports car. Perfect car for a family who needs a mini-van but doesn't want to get one. Very comparable to higher-end SUVs. Would highly recommend a close look at the Enclave to any family with three or more children."
buick,enclave,2008,M and T, 06/24/2007,Wow - nice vehicle!,5,"Now driven for about 1000 miles and am absolutely impressed. For the size of the vehicle (7 passenger) the Enclave is super quiet, handles well, gets decent gas mileage, is great to look at, and seems well built. Superior to my wife's Cadillac SRX in every way but handling and came in at a better price! "

buick,enclave,2008,Hook, 07/26/2007,Enjoying my Enclave,4,"Took delivery of a CXL FWD last week. Very pleased with the quiet ride and solid handling. Worksmanship appears excellent. I didn't measure the first tank of fuel but got 18.6 mpg on the second, with about 50/50 highway/city driving. Has plenty of power for everything I've needed thus far."
buick,enclave,2008,very happy, 08/05/2007,Great SUV,5,"I test drove the Outlook, Acadia, and Enclave. As soon as I was in the Enclave I had made up my mind. Very quiet interior, great looks on the outside, great standard features as compared to the other two, and nice option packages. I find the power to be more than enough and can tow 4500 pounds with the towing package. I don't need a V8 and don't want to sacrifice the milelage. I traded in a Honda for a Buick...I would never had believed that was possible.  I could not be more pleased. I am driving a great looking car (people are asking me all the time what it is) that is very comfortable. The sound system is great and when the radio is on you feel like you are in your living room."

I test drove most of the SUVs in the  mid and large sections. I was very surprised to find that the Buick Enclave had fantastic handling and good gas mpg(for its size). It is a beautiful and logical car making it easy and fun to drive. The large capacity is perfect for all the members of my family, most of them being very tall. It is larger than most of the big truck SUVs, but it drives like a car.  I have never considered owning an American car before.  I must say, I love my new Buick Enclave!  It is a quality car that comfortably fits seven people for a much lower price than the Acura or Lexus."
buick,enclave,2008,abittel, 08/14/2007,First Buick Ever,4,"We started looking early 2007, but really wanted to see the Enclave. Test drove Edge, Pacifica, and Veracruz. We finally got to see the Enclave and it was truly spectactular. We just had a hard time finding one to buy. People come up to us all of the time and want to see the car and want to know about it!  I have only had Lincoln Continentals for the past 20 years, so this was a big step to buy a Buick. We have not been dissapointed. It is actully shorter and narrower than my Lincoln (more room in the garage!)"
buick,enclave,2008,Vanessa, 08/14/2007,Love This car,4,We have a two year old and one on the way and purchased a Cadillac Crossover 3 months ago. The Cadillac design was impratical and designed poorly. The Buick Enclave is a breath of fresh air. I love that not only does it look great- it functionality and practicality rivals any minivan. Both my husband and I love driving the car and are looking foward to the many miles that we will be able to drive this car.

I had considered the Lexus and Acura, but believe the Ecncave blows them away.  It also puts the Mercedes to shame, and at a lesser cost!  My only complaint is the lack of smoothness in the transmission, but based on all of it's attributes I can forgive this slight flaw.  This automobile is on a par with my Cadillac DTS!"
buick,enclave,2008,Vig Rig in Ohio, 08/30/2007,"It's Not Perfect, But GM Got It Right",4,"FWD CXL has all bells and whistles. Punt the Nav and save $2k w/Ent Pkg#2 DVD w/ surround. OnStar does everything the nav does and has significant safety benefits as well. My 9 year old had the rear audio wireless system operational in minutes! The engine is smooth and pleasingly powerful. The exhaust note is perfect. The cabin is exemplary, with outstanding switchgear that has excellent tactile feel. Interior lighting is superb. The ""Googley-Eyed"" Bi-Zenon articulating headlamps light to the horizon. I traded in a '04 Sequoia: I could hardly read the dash in any lighting. Enclave's dash is the new benchmark. What? No red line on the tach? This car is one sexy station wagon: The Real Roadmaster"
buick,enclave,2008,McD, 08/29/2007,"Style, comfort, performance from USA",5,"I was always looking at imports but held off buying once I saw the concept for the Enclave. Glad I waited. Love the comfort, ride, many features. Even my 5'4"" wife is liking it despite its size. The backup camera makes it easy to back up without fear of hitting anything. We have put 7,000 miles on it in 3 months."
buick,enclave,2008,budi, 09/05/2007,Better than the rest by a wide margin,4,"This vehicle does so many things well. I looked at a lot of vehicles before choosing the Enclave. Other 3 row CUV's do not match up to the Enclave's value, refinement, reliability, usability (storage capacity/passenger room and comfort) Car has good acceleration for a vehicle its size and role as a luxury family hauler. The vehicle cools down quickly. You can access the third row from both sides of the car unlike the MDX and you don't have to be a contortionist. It has plenty of room behind the 3rd row for a stroller and cooler. I could go on and on."
buick,enclave,2008,David, 09/09/2007,Reserved but hopeful,4,"Traded in my wife's beautiful inspiration yellow T-Bird on a Buick...and I questioned our sanity on both purchases. One day after purchase we ventured out on a 1000 mile winery tour and I'm happy to say we feel our minds are in fact stable. I'm around/in vehicles of all kinds in various stages of their life every day, so my ratings are on a very broad scale of experience. I was suprised by the admirable mpg averages and it's ability to make hours behind the wheel pass quickly and comfortably.  We have every option but AWD and the Luxury package (folding mirrors, power wheel, and the lighting trick GM killed the Tucker for some 50 years ago), so we'll see how it all holds up. God Bless!"
buick,enclave,2008,Steve White, 09/08/2007,Very nice so far,4,"Bought my Enclave (CXL, AWD) 3 days ago and very pleased so far. Traded up from a 2002 Rendezvous, and if you know that car you'll know I had some concerns about buying another Buick. The Enclave, however, is superb: no defects and no trips back to the dealer. Handling and ride are far superior to the Rendezvous, and to the other 'cross-over' cars we looked at. The Ford Edge/Lincoln MKZ is the only real competitor among domestics, and it's a little jittery on the road. Lexus RX350 is equal to the Enclave but a lot more money, and I couldn't find a new (2008) Highlander anywhere to compare.  So take a look at the Enclave: you'll be impressed."
buick,enclave,2008,Mario, 09/10/2007,From BMW to Buick and happy.,4,"As a BMW owner for the last 10 years this is my first purchase of a Buick ever. To be honest there hasn't been a Buick model that ever looked worthy of owning, untill now. I have only had it for 3 weeks and so far this looks like it will be a winner for GM. The ride and interior are both very comfortable and the value received for the money spent is incredible. Every option that you could want at about $300 a month less in a lease versus BMW. Of course this large vehicle does not accelerate nor corner like an X5 but it wasn't built for that. Nevertheless, it does what it was built to do and very well I may add. A great vehicle for mid to long road trips. I highly recommend it."
buick,enclave,2008,Beaty's, 09/13/2007,Hangers?,4,"Fit and finish all seem top notch. Overall, the car is better than anticipated. Haven't had it long enough to know about reliability. Only complaint is how to hang clothes on the second row seating, as in picking up dry cleaning."
buick,enclave,2008,schwarz, 10/06/2007,Best Vehicle I've Ever Owned,5,"After buying the 2008 Enclave my husband and I never looked back. This is by far the most car for the money. It turns heads wherever we go and rightfully so. Its sleek style and detailed design commands attention. I would recommend anyone who needs a vehicle which seats more than 4 to take a good look at the Enclave. You will not regrete it!  It is fun to drive and very comfortable. I hate long road trips, but for the first time in a long time, I'm looking forward to one.  Buick, you did an outstanding job. This American made vehicle will give the foreign makers a run for their money."
buick,enclave,2008,mashs54, 10/11/2007,Glad I waited!,5,"We compared a lot of vehicles in this class and had narrowed the choice to the Outlook. Then I drove the Buick and it was all over. I ordered one the next day and I'm glad I waited. The ride is so smooth and quiet.  My husband agrees the fit and finish are outstanding for an American car; Buick has excelled here. It is comfortable on long trips and a real looker.  I get compliments everywhere.  I am interested in the center console if possible, but overall am delighted."
buick,enclave,2008,PA_Dave, 06/14/2007,Best Buick in Years,4,"My last car was an Infinti G35 coupe, and I traded it for a Blue CXL FWD two weeks ago and love it. They should have called it a Roadmaster: Quiet comfortable cabin, great styling, tons of room, plenty of pep, very smooth over bumps even with 19"" rims (if you keep the tire pressure at 32 fr/30 rr). Excellent handling for a big SUV, much better than the Trailblazer I rented last year. So far gas mileage is not bad, 19-20 in mostly city driving, 24 on a short hwy run. Only rarely noticed trans downshift issue reported in mag reviews, but the terrain is pretty flat here. "
buick,enclave,2008,Dan, 06/14/2007,"An awesome, upscale joy to own!",4,"Lots of research went into our choice of the Enclave. We have not been disappointed!  It is a joy to drive, offering super quiet interior and ride, plush CXL leather seating, Bose speaker system, handles fantastic on the road. We towed our boat this weekend, and it handled it better than my previous SUV, hands down. A lot of thought went into this vehicle. We're getting better than stated gas mileage, which is a nice surprise!  "
buick,enclave,2008,PJ, 06/22/2007,This is a GM product?,4,"Was ready to buy an Acadia AWD, and then saw the Enclave CX FWD. More standard items. Acadia has no traction control. It was a no brainer Enclave all the way. MSRP's really close. Saturn Outlook would not discount MSRP!  Extremely quiet, Buick did a great job on keeping the quiet in and sound out. Driving a pleasure, even my wife says its ""so big"" but does not drive that way, comfortable luxury ride, good handling for its size. It's surprising on turns. Very nice fit and finish. All around gas is decent according to the cars computer 17.5 Waiting to take it on a trip. This is my first GM in a long time and I do not think it is a GM car! I traded a Sienna van and have no regrets. What took Buick so long!? "

buick,enclave,2008,rich, 06/25/2007,I can't believe we own a Buick,4,"We looked at the Acadia, Outlook, SRX and Mazda cx9 and ended up with the enclave...much nicer (classier) interior than all but the SRX, and it has a 4 year warranty too...took a 1200 mile trip on day 4 and the car ran perfectly...very smooth and quiet ride, in fact one of the most quiet cars Ive driven...the front seats are very comfortable and I didn't get out of the car after 3 or 4 hours all tired and stiff...no complaints so far"
buick,enclave,2008,Dave, 07/06/2007,Road Master,5,"I love this SUV. Had it a month now. Very quiet and comfortable. Handles well. Mileage as advertised. Many car reviews complain about the trans not downshifting quickly. These reviewers didn't understand when/how to use the manual shifter. On hilly highways select 5 instead of D. 6th gear is for mostly flat highways. On backroads D is fine. The auto-manual shifter works differently than my other cars. If you select 4 or 5 in manual mode, the trans will auto downshift and upshift to the gear selected. My other cars only downshift auomatically but require you to manually upshift through each gear.

buick,enclave,2008,Ed, 07/17/2007,Great car,4,"Just returned from a 1360 mi. trip thru the Colorado Rockies. The Enclave was a joy to drive, and performed very well. The trip gave us a chance to try all the bells and whistles. The car is loaded with everything (more than we orignally wanted) but with limited dealship inventory, we took what was available. Trip included multiple mtn. passes with elevation over 10k ft., and as high as 12k. We got 24.6 MPG overall, which I thought was great considering the terrain driven. Often when we returned from a hike or train ride we found people gathered around the car in the parking lot admiring it. We researched a lot of cross-over models, and we think we made the right choice. "
buick,enclave,2008,jgeiss, 07/16/2007,So far I love it,4,Just purchased 2 weeks ago and really like this vehicle. Gave up fully loaded 2004 Tahoe and thought I was going to miss it.  Not yet. Drives like a luxury car and has so much room.
buick,enclave,2008,bioedwards, 07/27/2007,Best on the Lot,5,"After driving may competing alternative vehicles, the Enclave out classed them all. Although it took 4 months to get, it was worth the wait. Every aspect of the Enclave is very satisfying. It is obvious from many ""minor"" details that much engineering went into the development of the car. As the owner of 4 Buicks prior to this one, it is the best I've driven in 20 years. The car seems bigger once inside that it appears from the outside, yet it drives nimbly. Anyone that wants a vehicle to carry more than 4 people comfortably needs to drive the Enclave before purchasing any other vehicle. Great Job Buick!"
buick,enclave,2008,Frank, 08/01/2007,First Impressions,5,After 15 years of European cars we finally found a US built vehicle we wanted to own. After a test drive we knew something great had finally come from GM. It was like a jumbo MDX that made a first impression so quiet we could actually talk and enjoy the music. Handling is that of a sedan half the size and seating is second to nothing we ever owned.  We were not in the market for a car but had gone to the dealer for an upgrade to an OnStar system when we saw it. Two days later we took it home. For the first time in my life I got a new car with nothing to fix right from the dealer.
buick,enclave,2008,kaeleen, 08/04/2007,Unexpected surprise,5,"I love the quiet ride of this vehicle. I was extreamly surprised at how elegant it looks inside. I looked at many other SUVs and none compared to this one. I love the comfort of the leather seats and all my grandchildren fit in comfortably. I was surprised how big and roomy it is. I also love the sunroof and moon roof. Im 47 years old and never expected to be driving a Buick, that is the kind of car my Grandfather drove, not me. But I drive one and love it. "
buick,enclave,2008,Tom, 08/11/2007,Excellent American car,5,"I've had this vehicle for about a month and have driven 2300 miles.  Everything about it is a joy. This replaces my Acura TL.  The Buick's quality is superior to Acura.  No rattles, no issues.  It's the most comfortable car I've ever had. If GM pays attention to design and quality like it did with the Enclave, it will begin to compete again."
buick,enclave,2008,ExRIGuy, 09/08/2007,Makes my 07 Acura MDX look bad,5,"We are a mid 30's couple with 3 kids who typically buys imports. I recently purchased a 2007 Acura MDX Sport to replace a Lexus -- so I have a good reference point. We traded in a Toyota Sienna. Never thought we'd buy a Buick, but were always open to an American car that is competitive on the merits. This car makes a mockery of most competitors. This is a remarkable car that feels like it should cost $15k more (at least).  Build quality and quietness are superior to my Acura, and it is far more plush and stylish in my opinion. It appears to be nothing short of the rebirth of the American family vehicle. Put your image of Buick as you know it aside and give this thing a try.  "
buick,enclave,2008,jrhilarioUS, 09/18/2007,A winning design for an American Co.,4,"A remarkable overall exterior design that get a lot of attention. People stop to check it out, walk around it and give an approving nod. Even double check the Buick name on the back in a pleasant surprise. And that's just from 0 mph on the parking lot. On the road is another story. This Buick Enclave is a sure candidate to be a classic, well engineered inside and out. Its design elements all blends together appealingly devoid of any offensive lines and/or bulges like most other vehicles. This SUV is pleasant to the eyes. As for performance, it could use a few more horses, otherwise it is a well equiped and capable SUV. Maybe shedding a few lbs will do the trick. Bravo Buick!   "
buick,enclave,2008,Kim, 09/17/2007,Proud Owner!,5,We love our Enclave. It is fun to drive and easy to handle. The back up sensors are awesome. A breeze to park in small crowded parking lots.

I have loved and sang praises of my new car! I traded my 2009 Yukon XL for this car to save on gas and loved the downsize and savings. Since I purchased my Yukon brand new and never had issues, I opted out of the extended warranty on this car thinking I wouldn't have issues either. Boy was I wrong! Within a month one of the coil packs went out but it was replaced at no charge under dealership 30 day warranty. Six months later I started having transmission problems and my transmission needed to be replaced. Within two weeks of it being replaced started having other trouble and had to replace the throttle body. Since then I have had to replace every coil pack, the timing chain and everytime I get it fixed months later there are more problems.

buick,enclave,2009,David Romer, 11/09/2016,"Engine failure with less than 50,000 miles",1,"I became aware of a transmission issue with this make/model of vehicle after purchasing the vehicle from my Wife's grandmother (first owner).  The transmission felt like it was slipping and the service engine light came on so I attempted to drive the vehicle into the dealership, but ended up requiring a tow when the vehicle broke down on the freeway.  The dealership found a  broken rocker arm, opened the engine and determined that the engine required complete replacement (vehicle under 50,000 miles).  I was told by the dealership that they could not identify the cause of the issue.  GM offered to cover less than half of the cost to replace the engine (My bill will be $5,500). Once the engine is replaced the dealership will have to inspect the transmission and possibly replace the wave plate.  My plan is to repair the vehicle, sale it, and never again drive a GM vehicle.

buick,enclave,2009,Lindsey, 09/16/2015,WORST CAR I'VE EVER OWNED,1,"I bought my car in Feb. 2014 with 28k miles on it... A month later the steering wheel started making a whining noise. I took it to the dealership and they said ""that is common with those SUV's"" and this was when the recall on the power steering came out. So I said ok, what if I'm driving down the road and my power steering goes out? They said ""then we will fix it."" That's safe! Fix the problem AFTER something bad happens... And shortly after this I had to replace the water pump (@ $385- which was the 2nd time it had been replaced and my car still had less than 40k miles!) Then, on my way to work one day a few months later my car made a terrible noise so I pulled over... The timing chains broke (that's great for the transmission)... So I had those replaced under special policy. A few months after that... my car was running TERRIBLY. The transmission was slipping. I took it to another dealership and they fixed the 3-5-R plate under special policy but then I needed my A/C fixed as well as a coil and spark plug replaced. I ended up paying over $475 this time.  A month or so later... 2 more coils and spark plugs needed replaced as well as the front engine mount. I was quoted over $1100 and my car has 62k miles on it currently!! I got the car back after the repairs and the 2nd time I drove it it is saying ""LOW OIL PRESSURE. STOP ENGINE!"" So I give up. I am trading it. I don't feel comfortable selling it to someone individually! I am SICK that I have to trade because I was planning on driving this for a very long time! I have 2 children and they LOVE the DVD player. I love the back up camera and we couldn't ask for anything prettier or better on the inside! When you have a car that you're going to lose over $10k on it really makes you disgusted with the company! I have contacted GM and they say ""I will note your issues"" .... It's like oh thanks. I'm glad you're taking the time to do that.. how about reimbursing me for all the money I've spent in repairs, tows, missed time from work because my car wouldn't start, etc. etc.??? I will NEVER buy another GM car! Worst company ever.

buick,enclave,2009,sfreid1, 03/15/2014,No Longer Own Ours... Buyer Beware!!!,3,"When the Enclave is working properly, it is an excellent car. Quiet, comfortable, and fairly powerful for an SUV. However, there was rarely a time where everything was in proper working order. Our first major issue was the entire throttle body going out, which also caused the entire electrical system to crash, leaving us stranded on the side of a busy road, partially blocking traffic. This experience also gave us a chance to try out Onstar, which was worthless. The hazards also drained the battery after one hour, so they didn't work. After that, buttons snapped off, brakes needed replacement, transmission, and power steering prob. We just bought a fully loaded 2014 Infiniti QX60 and love it!"
buick,enclave,2009,John Smith, 10/02/2018,Have to do your homework before you buy one.,4,"2009  AWD   CXL   Make sure this vehicle has had the timing chain RE-program recall done before you buy or your engine will jump or stop, make sure it has had the water pump replaced.  Shock go bad about 80k miles,  make sure it has had a transmission fluid flush by 65k miles or you will be replacing that (be nice to your transmission, it is not durable).  Do regular oil changes (a must with this engine), Steering wheel has a squeek on most of them, will possibly require coils/plugs at 65k miles, but most GM's do.  LCD controls are not easy to navigate, LCD is not very clear with back up camera.  Headlights/fog lights rock!  Bluetooth works very well, but not easy to connect the first time compared to Ford sync.  Gas mileage under normal city driving, maybe 13-15 at best.  Highway maybe18-22 at best.  When taken care of properly, this is a great suv to drive.

buick,enclave,2009,Herb Walstreet, 12/01/2015,Beautiful / Horrible,1,"This car is cursed.  We had a Yukon XL for 10 years and never had any issues.  We have 80k miles or so on this vehicle and have spent around $10k in various maintenance and repairs.  We've had to replace the transmission 11 months ago and it's currently in the shop because of a stutter it has in cruise on the highway (ignition coils?).  We know our power steering is going out but it's not bad enough that Buick will replace it under the extended warranty.  Our heated seats only stay on for about 5 mins then go off.  The instrumentation buttons (AC temp control) have worn incredibly fast (replaced them once already), have had a ""stuck strut"", replaced rotors, replaced the battery and some decorative adhesive molding on the window frames is bubbling up and shredding (looks horrible when you look at the driver's side of the car).  All of this and our gas mileage is terrible also (13 in the city and 18 highway).  I want to like this car - it's really good looking but we've got to get rid of it and we'll avoid Buick.

buick,enclave,2009,Brent Copple, 09/06/2018,Tranny issues,2,"2009 Buick Enclave cxl. I bought this car in May 2017 with 130,000 miles. I have had no complaints until a couple weeks ago. Enclave shakes when accelerating up hills or from a dead stop. Loses power and runs up RPMs. Took it to dealership where it was purchased and was told the transmission needs to be replaced. So I decide to do some research about this particular vehicle and all I can find is nothing but people complaining about the transmission going out on their vehicles. My Enclave now has a hundred and seventy-one thousand miles and is worth approximately $8,000 with a good transmission. If I put a new transmission in it will cost me approximately $3,600. It's just not right when you pay for a vehicle and you can only enjoy it for a year-and-a-half because of transmission issues. I think GM has a lot of growing to take place if they're going to ever try to compete with quality of Toyota Highlander or Honda Pilot. From what I read on reviews people claim they have had to replace fuel pump, power steering pump, etc.  I know for sure I will not buy another GM product based on my experience and reading what other people have gone through. A $40,000 vehicle should not have transmission issues."
buick,enclave,2009,Lisa, 08/09/2018,Never again GM,1,"We bought our 2009 Buick Enclave from a shady dealership, didn't know that at the time. It had 95000 miles on it. We loved the way it looked and we liked the way it drove. Paid way too much for it. Immediately took it to Buick because of a hesitation problem when accelerating. Was told that there were no problems. Had it for approximately a year when we found out that it needed the timing chain replaced. Took it back to Buick and were told because it was 4000 miles over the special warranty that we would have to replace the timing chain ourselves. Even though I explained that I had brought the truck to them immediately after buying it because of the same issue but they still refused to honor the special warranty. Couldn't afford to fix the problem immediately and drove it for another 9 months until it could not be driven anymore. Took it to the dealership we bought it from and they did the work on it. 3 days after getting it back the transmission blew. And since it has been one chronic issue after another. Granted the car now has 206, 000 miles on it but in this day and age that should be nothing for a car, not a $40, 000 vehicle. We are now completely upside down on our loan after putting in over $10, 000 in repairs which has included the engine control module, power steering pump, alternator, ignition coils, CV axle, catalytic converters, O2 sensor, and more. And we are now certain that we need another transmission. As soon as we can come up with the money we are turning the car over to the bank and going back to the reliable vehicles, Honda. GM sucks and I will never buy another product from them again. Not only do they put out poor quality vehicles but their customer service is awful.

They said they replaced this and that but every year after that I kept taking it back for the same problem of kicking back when going uphill.  As soon as the warranty ran out I had to take it in again and this time ended up paying over $700 to fix two of the cylinders.  Have tried cleaning out carbon.  It is even worse now than it ever was.  Can't drive it with cruise on because it has started kicking back even on straight flat roads.  Check engine light constantly comes on and we have spent close to $1500 just trying to get things looked at to try and figure out the problem.  Have called GM to try and have them reimburse my dollars and stand behind their product but they won't.  For such a huge company, it's too bad that they treat their customers this way.

buick,enclave,2009,vsabre, 02/26/2014,Enclave Woes!,3,"I purchased my 2009 Enclave in 2012 and in the first year I owned it, I have had the following problems: 1. Timing Chain, 2. Water pump, 3. Front Struts, 4. Rack and Pinion, 5. Power Steering Pump, 6. Engine Mount, 7. Washer fluid pump and 8 Transmission.
 And since the car never goes more than one week without a check engine light coming on (which disables the remote start), the remote start is not available most of the time.
Other than that, I love the car. "
buick,enclave,2009,donbee1, 01/30/2015,Expensive vehicle to own,3,"I bought my 2009 Enclave used with 60K on the clock a year and a half ago. Since then had to replace high pressure fuel pump, battery, and just got it back from the shop after having BOTH catalytic converters replaced for check engine light and rough running. I have owned a bunch of cars in my life and never had a catalytic converter go bad, let alone two on the same car at the same time. Love the ride and gagetry but repairs very expensive. Definately not a do it your self repair vehicle. Mileage combined around 20. I expected a little better. The third Buick I have owned and may be the last. The extended warranty was useless. Only covered ""internal"" parts. P.S. Since the original review Had to replace motor as it seized at 130K,of course, the extended warranty expired at 100k to the tune of $7500. Never again GM. Next time will be an import.
 Update: so far, no further issues.
Still running, get the occasional "" error message of the week"" that magically go away such as tire pressure monitor, stabilitrac disabled, etc. that seem to go away when the car is turned off with no codes set. Had a problem with the battery going dead overnight, Turned out to be my Garmin GPS randomly turning itself on as it was plugged into the front accessory socket. Now I leave it unplugged when not in use.
Now up to 218000 miles and still holding on. The CEL of the week still pops up intermittently  and one of the TPM sensors has gone south but seems to have settled down. We are in the midst of moving and keeping our fingers crossed that she will make through all the trips left.

buick,enclave,2009,don, 03/02/2010,Great ride,5,"I bought this vehicle after I read 50 reviews and some test drives. Other folks have done a great job of describing the joys of an Enclave.  I have experienced mileage as high as 28 on flat road 55mph and no traffic. Typical on interstate at 70 is 23-24 if you keep your foot steady. 2 complaints- tires extremely noisy on some roads. I drive with both feet and periodically, if my foot is resting on the brake when I accelerate, the vehicle jumps.  Have had a couple close calls. I now make sure my foot is off the brake.  Dealer says my brake foot is confusing the throttle computer causing it to feed in more gas. One Toyota has same problem."
buick,enclave,2009,mark, 05/23/2009,Never though I would drive a Buick,4," We narrowed our choice down to the Audi Q7, Acura MDX and finally bought an 2009 Enclave CXL AWD (Carbon Black).  We truly love the car.  Very roomy.  Great design. Super quiet. Handling very good for an SUV. The third row comfortable for three.  We are a family of four. GM did a good job on this car.  This is an excellent SUV Crossover that should be striving to be the best in every category, it has that kind of potential.  There is need for some tweaking, such as real wood, better MPG and throttle response/shift adjustment.  I would highly suggest the Enclave to anyone looking for a solid, well designed SUV. "
buick,enclave,2009,Jamie L. Quin, 02/26/2019,Lord help me I need it!,1,"I have a 2009 Buick enclave cxl, I never had a brand new vehicle in my entire life and I'm 45 years old, this was the vehicle I thought I always wanted. The ride is very very comfortable but.......since I've had this vehicle of 3 years I have had to change motor mounts, water pump, serpentine belt, radiator, hot water hoses, coil packs (twice) and I also have one to be change this weekend. I have also had the transmission plate replaced, new speakers all the way around and new chair motor, crank relay switch, ignition relay switch, replaced a headlight, replaced day lamps of which only (1) works at a time never both, replaced back lamp and now periodically it just does not say a word and takes a few tries to crank. the dealership kept it over night and the diagnostic read nothing, but they did clear a few codes. I have had to have this vehicle towed (4) times, I owe wayy more than it's worth so I can not trade it in. I hope and pray that GMC takes these reviews into consideration when producing the next wave of Enclaves...I really like the Enclave but my God I can not afford it and wish that I can give a good review once on them.

buick,enclave,2009,mlerlie, 02/07/2012,"Beautiful, but unreliable",2,"Have owned luxury German cars for well over three decades but the beauty of the Enclave won us over while living in hilly Maryland. Big mistake. Expensive mistake. As other reviewers say, there are too many things going wrong for such a young vehicle. Plastic outside between the windows bubble/ripple, car rolls back while in drive on a hill as if it were in reverse, car rolls at least 6 inches after putting it in park on flat land, knocking noise when turning steering wheel either way, absolutely abysmal gas mileage - bottom end of mpg range, very sluggish on hills, but the deal breaker was the slipping transmission on a 3 year old car with less than 50k miles. Went back to BMW after 10 mo."
buick,enclave,2009,NESSA709, 12/09/2008,Ms. Enclave,4,This is a very nice and comfortable riding SUV. GM has always had the best riding cars without all the road noise. Fit and finish is very nice for an American car maker.
buick,enclave,2009,BS, 03/07/2009,"Smooth, Quiet, Stylish",4,"We test drove the Cadillac SRX and Mercedes R350, but the Enclave beat them both, hands down.  Much quieter and smoother ride and more cargo room."
buick,enclave,2009,Brad, 03/08/2009,Excellent Vehicle!,4,"This is the best vehicle my wife and I have purchased.  THe quality is outstanding.  A relative of ours had the 2008 Enclave CX and we couldn't wait to get rid of our Trailblazer to get one.  It drives smoothly, is VERY quiet, and we enjoy the XM radio.  We test drove the Mazda CX-9, the Toyota Rav4 and the Toyota Highlander.  The Enclave CX came with the most ""bells- and whistles"" standard than any vehicle we looked at."
buick,enclave,2009,Red Jewel Enclave, 04/09/2009,Buick Hit It Out Of The Park,5,"The Buick Enclave is a thoughtfully designed vehicle that is beautiful in every way. The exterior styling with the Red Jewel tintcoat is stunning against the chrome finishings. We chose the cashmere leather with cocoa accents, which sets off the luxurious tone of the interior. The Edmund's editor doesn't like the interior 'bling', but we love it. On a recent road trip, we averaged 22mpg.  With city driving mixed in we are seeing an overall average of 19mpg, so we are very satisfied with the fuel economy. No other SUV comes close to this one in terms of comfort, quietness and luxury features. My other car is a Cadillac and all I want do now is drive the Enclave (but the wife won't let me)."
buick,enclave,2009,jack rezai, 05/11/2010,Love my buick enclave,4,"GM won me back with this SUV! The interior and exterior quality is excellent. I had an 08 highlander before my buick, and the quality was not even close. seats are very comfortable and very supportive. Driving this vehicle is a joy. Ride is smooth, comfortable, stable and quiet even in high winds. AWD system works perfectly. I live in Calgary, AB, Canada, and the AWD, Stabilitytrack, and traction control system provides stable and comfortable ride. I have not gotten stuck in snow and mudd even once. My sister with her subaru SUV got stuck, I didn't. This vehicle has lots of rooms! Love the look and the style. Welcome Back GM! Great work :)"
buick,enclave,2009,Gary Moman, 02/01/2019,Wish I had read more reviews first,3,"Bought a 2009 in Jan 2019 with 163k. Very clean, well kept, great interior, with all the usual accolades given by those who purchased new and need to brag about their choice. Lots of style. I wonder if any of those original buyers still have theirs. You expect to have issues with an older unit, but these are unacceptable. Shifting is sometimes just some wild guess as far as I can tell. As reported by others here the engine often stumbles at any nominal cruise speed, especially on a slight upgrade. It often has great difficulty deciding what gear to use. It originally complained about evap canister valve (P0496, replaced it) and misfires on cylinders 4 and 6. Seemed like some simple repairs. Replacing parts has not yet fixed the misfire problems. Can't really tell if engine or tranny is responsible for all the cruise stumbling problems, but both are suspect. Expected much better from a Buick. My last three pickups (F150s) all got equal or better gas mileage and only one had transmission problems, at over 300,000 miles.  The 93 Silverado tranny hunted from new and died at 180,000 so I guess GM just can't get their act together. No more GM vehicles for me.

buick,enclave,2009,sarah, 11/11/2010,More Con's than Pro's,3,"I bought my 2009 Enclave in Florida then moved to the mountains in Virginia 10mo later. First off the car is really loud when standing outside but quiet on the inside.These are the things going wrong. Plastic outside between the windows bubble/ripple, coating came off of air conditioner button, carpet worn completely down on passenger side, car rolls back while in drive on a hill as if it were in reverse, car rolls at least 6 inches after putting it in park on flat land, knocking noise when i turn my steering wheel either way and the carpet is made very very cheap.All these things are covered under warranty except the carpet.Still have problems with car rolling back while n drive on hill. "
buick,enclave,2009,tyler, 09/03/2008,A Huge Step Up,5,"We traded in from a Toyota Seqouia and we are very happy. It rides like nothing youve ever been in. The interior is amazing and very well built. The gas mileage is best in class and it's gorgeous outside and in. A may be a bit slow, but it is very swift compared to all other SUVs I've driven, to which it should be compared. The warranty is unbeatable and new GM are supposed to be very reliable from what ive heard and read about in auto magazines. It's extremely quiet too."
buick,enclave,2009,Enclave Fan, 12/08/2008,The Buick Enclave is Fantastic!,5,"Bought my 09 Buick Enclave a few months ago and I am very pleased. The styling is gorgeous, the build quality is tight and sharp, and the ride is very comfortable even for a big guy like me. I tried the Acura MDX which is so overrated, the Lexus 330 is another wildly overrated SUV, the Audi, BMW, and Mercedes' comparable SUVs cost 25-30K more and aren't any better. The Buick Enclave has great interior space, just hauled a Christmas tree and wreath to the house with room to spare, and the mileage has been averaging 17mpg with AWD! The engine is strongly reactive and the steering is tight and responsive. The interior noise is practically zero! I've owned a lot of vehicles and this Buick rocks!"
buick,enclave,2009,libby, 12/18/2008,Quiet Ride,4,"Having three young boys to drive around to activities, I racked up over 130,000 miles on a Ford Expedition. My husband and I decided it was time to buy a new car. We needed a large enough car to  to hold the five of us. And this time I wanted a car with a quiet ride, better gas mileage, sunroof, plus all the bells and whistles. After test driving numerous cars, I fell in love with the Enclave's quiet and smooth ride. My kids love the sunroof, and comfortable bucket seats. GM got it right, right, right! OnStar is fun to use, the headlights, back-up camera,and 19 inch wheels are a bonus too. I test drove many crossover vehicles, and I can't rave enough about this car.   "
buick,enclave,2009,Detailman80, 12/28/2008,Love my Enclace,5,"I really enjoy the overall appearance of the Enclave (has a bold yet eligant look). I am a bit disappointed with the shifting and pickup not being as smooth as I would have expected, but overall this is a class vehicle."
buick,enclave,2009,Wildhart, 01/22/2009,Gorgeous Car with Great Ride,4,"Wonderful, beautiful vehicle that handles and rides with ease.  Intown mpg so far is 20.7 mpg which is great. Love everything about it especially the driver memory and safety backup camera.  Only things that need improvement are more cup holders in front and more storage room suitable for CD's. As a woman, I would love somewhere to put my purse. We are looking forward to some road trips and many years of driving pleasure with this great car. GM Buick has hit a home run with this fantastic car. The foreign cars (Lexus, etc) that are in the same class, well, they just aren't. The Enclave is extremely nice. It has a smooth, quiet ride and can go toe to toe with any of the others. Love it!"
buick,enclave,2009,CAOwner, 02/22/2009,Love My Car,4,"Came from a minivan so I did lots of research. Was planning on an Acadia, but got a great deal on the Enclave fully loaded. I love all the extra features. It is comfortable, fun to drive - feels sturdy and safe, but hightly responsive. Great turning radius. Very versitile to transport kids and cargo, although slightly smaller that my van. Most of my driving is city, but just took it on a a long road trip to the snow with the family. I love it even more now. Handled beautifully and was very comfortable."
buick,enclave,2009,luv my enclave, 04/20/2009,Best large crossover (by far),4,"First let me say that I drove all the competition (MDX, Pilot, RX350, Highlander, CX-9, etc) and none can compare to the Enclaves combination of MPG, horse power, interior space, and fit/finish.  We just couldn't be happier with our new Enclave.  It simply blows away the competition.  Hopefully it is not too late for GM, but they finally got it right with this Buick.  If status appeal of the nameplate is not your top priority when buying a large crossover SUV, the Buick Enclave will be the natural choice."
buick,enclave,2009,Rob Wassem, 04/30/2009,Awesome Ride for Wassems,4,"I've not owned a GM since my 69 Camero when I was a senior in high school...what a change!  I've owned several large SUVs over the past 10 years including a MB GL450 recently.  The Enclave is far superior to he MB 350, 450, or 550 and half he price!  The ride is brilliant, the pick up is perfect, and the finish is right ON!  My family and I love the car/suv..not sure what to call it - crossover:)  If you are in the market for a new crossover buy the Enclave as I did the research for months and nothing compares if you require seating for 7 -  0% financing was icing on the cake!  "
buick,enclave,2009,Jim Evans, 05/02/2009,Oh!!!!!!!!!! what a smooth ride.,5,"We have always owned Yukons' but the ride of this Enclave,is so GREAT. Quiet !!!!! I can hear people in third row seat with no problem.  So much fun. "
buick,enclave,2009,LakeErieDriver, 05/04/2009,A Truly Awesome Vehicle,5,"I absolutely love this car.  It is the ultimate family vehicle and still offers style and comfort like in an upscale SUV.  Pricing is high though, ours stickered just over $50k.  We went from a 2007 Chrysler Aspen (full- size) and don't miss any space. Fuel Economy is great, we average about 18 city, 24 highway, sometimes even better! Very Luxurious, after all it's a Buick!"
buick,enclave,2009,Better Buy Buick, 05/23/2009,A Pleasant Drive,5,We ordered our Enclave as we did not want a lot of the options on cars the dealer had on his lot.  We have been extremely well pleased for the most part.  We travel with our dog and there is room for the crate plus luggage.  Last fall we traveled from Michigan to Boston and got 31-33 mpg on the New York Thruway traveling at the 65 mph speed limit.  Coming home on both the Thruway  and side trips we averaged 28 mph. Don't know what we get around town.  We liked the styling inside and out which is what attracted us to the car after doing much research.  Two of our neighbors were so impressed with the car they bought one themselves.  One of them traded in a newer Lincoln cross over.
buick,enclave,2009,Impressed, 05/25/2009,Very happy,5,"I saw the Enclave about a year ago and started my research immediately.  Compared to all the other sport looking crossovers, with a three pass third row seat, the Buick has the most standard features at a better or comparable price point.  I had a Tahoe, and I loved it, except for the cargo behind the third row, I couldn't even fit a standard stroller back there, so this time I was looking for the passenger room and functionality, and I found it.  My kids can easily access the third row.  It has all the pretty things that I wanted, to include the dual sun roofs and power liftgate.  It looks hot, drives like a dream, and made all my friends jealous!  And, you can't beat the warranty!  Thanks!"
buick,enclave,2009,Jeff, 06/14/2009,Went from Lexus RX to this! LOVE IT!,5,"We came out of the Lexus and wanted something with more room, but NOT a minivan.  We test drove so many new cars recently, and saw this car on lot and asked about it.  I was cautious because of the name Buick reminded me of my Dad's car.  Once we got in the car, I was shocked how nice everything was. The test drive was amazing!    "
buick,enclave,2009,NewClave, 08/03/2009,No More Imports For Us!,5,"Absolutely can't believe that I am saying this, but this Buick is the most amazingly comfortable and stylish vehicle we have ever owned. Coming from many Japanese SUV's (Toyotas and Nissans) we had boiled it down to a Lexus RX350, Audi Q5, and the Acura MDX, when we passed an Enclave on the road one day and my wife said... what was that. We were at the Buick dealership 30 minutes later, and after a test drive my wife fell in love. It doesn't even sound right when I say we bought a Buick, but this is no Buick of yesteryear. Way to go GM!"
buick,enclave,2009,buckeye boy, 09/17/2009,Great!!!! but.......,4,"We really enjoy our Enclave.  We moved out of a Toyota Sequoia and do miss the extra space and taller ride, however, this Buick is a remarkable vehicle overall.  I have only 2 complaints, I am only 5'-9"", unlike a previous reviewer I like the footrest on the left side.  My problem is either the seat is too short or the seat height is not right for me, I get a cramping sensation in my right thigh, especially after driving for awhile.  Second concern is that the middle position of the 8 seater will not easily accommodate a child seat as we hoped.  Should have tested that.  Overall a great vehicle and fun to drive."
buick,enclave,2009,JWL, 10/12/2009,CITY GAS MILAGE,4,Buick claims a city gas milage of 17 mpg on the EPA sticker. In straight city driving under the most conservative starts and stops my Enclave gets an averave of 11.7 MPG.  I have provided the dealership the gas receipts and milage.  The fact is that the 6 speed electrocic transmission holds the car in 2nd gear at 30 miles an hour causing the engine to Tach at a steady 1900 RPM. When the car passes 40 MPH the Tach drops to 1200 RPM. I was contacted by GM's Division Manager who told me that is how the transmission is calibrated and there is nothing they can do about it.  I bought this car based on the fuel estimates and I feel that they should be able to produce what they advertise. 31% less.
buick,enclave,2009,charlie, 03/18/2010,re-calibrate your tranny.,4,"This is short and sweet.I love my enclave.Love the looks, ride, comfort,and all the extras.Was not crazy about tranny shifting so much. Checked around and found out that your dealer can change something on the computer and your car won't shift as much. Didn't take long to do and it sure makes a difference. I think there is a bulletin put out by Buick if your dealer wants to know about it. All you guys with tranny stories, check it out.It does make a difference. It won't shift as  much. I hope this helps."
buick,enclave,2009,Enclave Owner, 10/05/2020,Awesome SUV,5,"its quiet a catch, all the room and features anyone could ask for. 152k miles and still going strong. Inside still just like new, as far as the chrome trim people are complaining about, its not that bad, i have seen vehicles coming towards me with chrome worse than this vehicle blinding you. I yet to be blinded by the chrome reflection.  But over all this vehicle 5 stars all around. Take care of it, it will take care of you and yours. The wife Loves it, great for Grandchildren. 
"
buick,enclave,2009,Mike`, 12/04/2008,Oh Boy,3,"The ride was incredible the comfort was out of this world. Then the engine light came on. Engineer flies in from GM, to find what he feels is a clearance problem with the head. We had the car for almost two weeks and has been at the shop for almost two and half weeks.  He is not even sure a new head will fix the problem. I hope GM stands behind their product. 1,500 miles on vehicle"
buick,enclave,2009,Denid, 04/19/2009,Great Experience,4,"I just purchased the Buick Enclave CXL A.W.D. with the Driver Confidence package,the Luxury package,entertainment package #1 with an after market drop down D.V.D. player,all for $42,500.00. I had researched for two months and test driven the Acura,Mercedes,Ford Flex and a Chevy Lumina.I feel that I have a really great value in the Enclave. It is truly a beautiful vehicle that's so much fun to drive."
buick,enclave,2009,Wiggs, 05/21/2009,NICE!,5,"First drove an Enclave in September, when I first started thinking of a new vehicle.  I drove the Buick, the Acadia, Honda Pilot, Outlook, Highlander and Ford Escape.  The Enclave was like steering butter.  Oh so smooth.  It is a very classy and comfortable vehicle with room to spare.  It is unbelievably quiet and the drive is smooth.  I bought 3 weeks ago.  Got a beautiful vehicle at a very good price and enjoy getting behind the wheel every day!"
buick,enclave,2009,Trav1, 01/15/2010,Over-hyped,4,I had this as a rental on a business trip from Detroit to Louisville. I find this to be a great way to really test drive a vehicle. Very nice vehicle but the EPA MPG rating is not even close. Actual pure highway MPG 20 at best. This was with the cruise control with average speed around 65- 70. The vehicle had around 1500 miles on it. The transmission tends to shift at lot which I found anoying.  This is a very nice highway vehicle. Overall quality appeared to be high.  Great vehicle for entertaining clients.
buick,enclave,2009,Don Bradbury, 02/02/2019,Never again,3,"This is the fourth Buick vehicle I have owned and the worst. I bought it used with 60K miles on the clock. I also purchased an extended warranty that was completely worthless as it covered none of the repairs. First lost the high pressure fuel pump, then 2 catylytic converters. The batteries died twice. The electrical system is extremely buggy as the check engine light of the week happens and most times magically disappears.The front blower fan shorted out due to water leakage from somewhere. I never did find the source. I have had the power steering issue. And at 130K miles the motor self destructed due to the timing chain issue. I have always driven a lot of miles with my vehicles and have NEVER had to replace a timing chain or catylytic converter. While I enjoy the comfortable ride and road presence of the car, it is sadly a money pit. I have nearly $10k invested in repairs. I have nearly 200k miles on the clock now and  I calculate I will need to go another 30 to run out my warranty on the replacement motor. When she dies, I will probably look hard at the import offerings.
"
buick,enclave,2009,HMT, 12/26/2008,A Lot To Like; Beware of EPA Estimates,4,"Last owned GM car was 1960. Since then only BMW, Mercedes and Lexus vehicles. This Enclave replaces my '98 Lexus 470 SUV and does a great job of emulating that SUV at half the cost. Unfortunately, it also copies the 470's poor gas mileage. I now have 3,000 miles on the Enclave, which includes two 1000 mile highway trips. In town I get 13 mpg and on the highway, 19 mpg. This is far from my anticipated EPA 16/22. Yes, the pickup from standing still at a traffic light to keeping up with the traffic is a bit of a struggle and noisy in that initial gear. However, the cabin appointments and general comfort are very desireable. Lots of goodies. Happy with car, very disappointed with mpg.  "
buick,enclave,2009,ANDY G., 02/12/2009,Better than Cadillac SRX,4,"This is the best car I ever owned. The smooth ride and the quietness is amazing compared to other cars I owned. You can actually hear the radio at high speeds, not tire noise. Vvery clear DVD system and tons of room. I think GM still makes the best cars."
buick,enclave,2009,dmb, 03/07/2009,the greatest car ever,5,The 2009 buick enclave is the best vehicle for the money.  I love all the features and the price was more than reasonable. 
buick,enclave,2009,Happy, 04/27/2009,New Car,4,I sent in a review and wanted people to know the outcome.  I am the gentleman that had a problem with the motor @1500 mile and hoped GM stood behind its product.  They replaced the vehicle with a new one exactly the way we ordered the first.  Hudson Buick GMC was exceptional thru the whole ordeal. Great vehicle you will love the ride.  Did from day one!!!!!
buick,enclave,2009,CollegeProf, 06/26/2009,Best of the Best,5,"This car replaced a Lexus RX-300 and a Lexus sedan.  Our cars were over 10 years old and we really loved our Lexus.  I can't believe how great this car is.  It drives around town like a dream.  I don't think you will need the running board step assist.  We have kids and my 5' 3"" wife doesn't have any problems getting in and out.  This is really well built.  The Lexus had some cool - gee whiz features that the Lexus doesn't, but overall I think this Buick better.  Good job GM!!  "
buick,enclave,2009,Amazed!!!, 08/25/2009,What Kind of Car Is It?,5,"I don't think I have ever owned a car people were so inquisitive about.  We drove the Enclave on a whim (actually to kill time while we waited on the salesman to find a Yukon on the lot).  Wow! What a suprize!  Our past 3 vehicles have been a Yukon and 2 Tahoes.  We actually had decided on another Yukon but we were not happy with the ride or the boxy look of the new body style.  We drove the Lexus, Infiniti, Tahoe, Yukon and kept coming back to the Buick. I researched and read over 70 reviews. They basically said the same thing. It's a great car!  We have 12K wonderful, enjoyable miles and it has been a pleasure every time I have opened the door.  I still can't believe I am driving a Buick."
buick,enclave,2009,schomeboy, 11/23/2009,not as advertised,3,"Bought car in ""clunker"" trade-in deal.  My wife fell in love with this car based on the interior and quiet ride.  she was correct on both.  however, after 4 months we see a couple of issues.  first, gas mileage is 15-20 not 17-24 as advertised! No different than the ""clunker"" we had.  took it back to dealer and of course found nothing wrong. had to put foam strips on underside of garage door because rear door lifts too high and bangs on bottom of garage door.  ill designed.  no clothes hook on second row seats.  to hang clothes you have to use hook by 3rd row seats and it is difficult to get to.  nice car overall, but I would look at others before investing this much money."
buick,enclave,2009,Doug, 09/24/2008,Great ride,5,"Took this on a 5500 mile trip this summer and was very happy.. good mileage and a super ride. Drove 75 (was on a lots of freeways) and got 23 miles a gallon..XM radio was really great as I am a first time user. I have 12,000 miles and it's running super. Took a little getting used to the six speed transmission in town but now I am used to it.."
buick,enclave,2009,MN Driver, 09/24/2008,High Quality Vehicle,5,"We compared the Enclave to the Audi Q7 and replaced a Yukon XL. My wife wanted something smaller, but that still has a third row. We initially were focused on the Acadia, but kept looking at the Enclave in the showroom and appreciated the chrome wheels and more refined interior. My wife preferred the Enclave versus the Q7 and we saved 13K as well."
buick,enclave,2009,FB3, 10/01/2008,Glad I waited for an '09,4,"Performance: Much better than last years anemic engine, but still doesn't have the nice low end torque of a V8. Glad I waited for an '09. Comfort: Front headrest not tilt adjustable. I think this was a new safety law. Second row seats quite small and minimum leg room. Fuel economy: So far very good for a vehicle of this size. Interior design: Nice except for the cheap semi-see through sun roof interior shades and small cramped second row seats. Build quality: Very good. As good as my 2008 Infinity M35. Very tight. Reliability: Too soon to know, but I have had excellent experiences with GM vehicles over the years and don't expect anything bad from this one.  "
buick,enclave,2009,clm, 10/15/2008,A vacation vehicle that works,4,Bought it to travel in have not been disapointed. Quiet ride deceiving in will suprise you when running 85 doesn't seem like it. Handles mountain roads well v-6 and 6 speed work well together. Interior comfortable but son thinks door decor cheesey would like wood grain to emulate steering wheel better.
buick,enclave,2009,Happy Customer, 10/24/2008,Great Vehicle,5,"This vehicle replaced a van that we really liked. However it is a huge step up. This is the nicest new vehicle I have ever purchased. This a gem that people need to look at. With the direct injection and variable valve timing, I get better fuel mileage than my van. It is well thought out and we enjoy all of the features it has to offer. It is comfortable and super quiet & smooth down the road. I would recommend this vehicle to anybody. My family loves it. Take one for a test drive. "
buick,enclave,2009,Scott, 10/29/2008,Pleasantly surprised,4,It has been a long time since we owned a GM car and I have to say that this one is much improved over years ago. The Enclave is very well made and quiet.  We get a lot of positive comments on its appearance. We have young teens and just traded in the minivan. Most of our disappointments are related to the fact that this vehicle doesn't have as much room as a minivan and is missing some of the interior accessories you would find in a van.
buick,enclave,2009,safars, 02/28/2009,Beautiful car,5,"Have been looking at cross overs for over a year and chose the Enclave over BMW, Mercedes and Lexus. Traded in Yukon for smaller SUV and definitely love this vehicle. Exceptionally quit ride and great handling with luxurious interior. Expected much ""smaller"" feel but was extremely impressed. Very roomy and easy access to everything. Love the look. Very happy with my decision.  "
buick,enclave,2009,Lovemybuick, 04/27/2009,Consider a Buick,4,"I found the  consumer reviews very helpful so I decided I should give my experience.  I looked at Toyota Highlander(no 60/40 split 3rd row)and Acura MDX (2nd row of seats do not move adjust for back passagers).  I kept coming back to the Buick.  This crossover is so quiet, it is riding in your living room.  We have already driven it on a long road trip and had no complaints.  The dealership was wonderful to work with and gave us a great price."
buick,enclave,2009,Paulinroswell, 06/10/2009,A Buick is better than a Lexus????,5,"So far, this is the best vehicle I have ever owned. I was hesitant to even consider it because I wanted the RX350 but my wife heard that this Buick was worth considering.  I hate to admit I am ever wrong but the Enclave is by far the better vehicle than the Lexus in every way after test driving both twice (I was really trying to convince myself that the Buick was worse the first time).  It gets good fuel economy, has great luxury features I want, safety features have no equal, and is made by the most dependable brand this year!  I never thought I would go back to an American car but if they continue to make vehicles like this, I will never leave! Kudos to Buick!  BTW...I am 35 in a Buick!?!"
buick,enclave,2009,phil, 06/23/2009,A solid and reliable car,4,"After 7 years without any problems in a Highlander, I switched to the Enclave AWD.  Features, past experience (I had two Buicks I drove as Federal law enforcement officer averaging 70K per year without any problems)price and 0% financing, it was a no brainer.  I also did some checking on the dealer and found another Enclave owner near where I live and he had very good experience with the dealer.  I have had the car now two months and still think I made the right choice.  The only thing I could think of to improve would be the mileage, although it comes close to the EPA standard. As of today (June 23rd) I have a little over 2000 miles without any problems. "

buick,enclave,2009,Hollis Stavn, 07/25/2009,Looks good but a few issues,3,The angle of the headrest tilts too far forward forcing my neck to not be able to be straight when driving. This is a design problem with this car. Another issue is that the cover for the sun roof is a screen only which lets some heat through so even with the sunroof closed you can feel the heat coming through on your head and also heating up the car. I have the basic sound package which is anemic in volume output. There is only one power outlet on the front console. There is a compartment on the dash which looks like it is a place to put glasses but being under the windshield will likely melt them in the heat. I traded a Rendezvous for this and the Rendezvous was actually a sportier drive.
buick,enclave,2009,briget, 08/03/2009,Love it! Traded in my BMW,4,"It's been about a month and half so far and I'm really enjoying my new Enclave!  We bought it new at 77 mi. and now have over 5K.  I traded in my BMW 750il 2000 to go SUV because of the extra seats & AWD for ski season & long distance trips.  The only reason I scored lower on performance is because I previously owned a sports car. :)  The other gripe is the fuel mileage.  It's been averaging about 21 mi. per gallon. I drive approximately 800 mi. per week. Otherwise, we love our new car!  "
buick,enclave,2009,Bryan Wagstaff, 08/12/2009,Sweet!,4,"I owned a Jaguar Vanden Plas and Chevy Astro and wanted a vehicle that combined the best of both. I found it in the Enclave. I now have the luxury of the Jag and the cargo/towing capabilities of the Astro. I also need an AWD/4WD vehicle to get me to my mountain cabin in the winter. The Enclave thus far has proven to be a sturdy, well built, fun to drive vehicle. There is so much about it that I like it's hard to know where to begin. However, of all the reviews I have read no one has mentioned the remarkable turning radius of the vehicle."
buick,enclave,2009,alvanhill, 08/18/2009,Base Enclave CXL,4,"Finally a salesperson listened and found a base vehicle for me to buy. The Enclave CXL FWD compares favorably with our 08 Lexus ES in comfort and quiet ride and has all the equipment I wanted without $$$'s in options. The six speed tranny takes some getting used to and I wish the drivers seat cushion gave more thigh support but this is a very nice vehicle for the money. More mpg would be nice but I think the DI engine will regulate that. At 7,000 miles the car delivers 24 mpg on the highway @ 70 mph."
buick,enclave,2009,LI Driver, 09/10/2009,Loving it so far,4,"After 4 minivans, I had to have a vehicle that offered more comfort and style, but still offered a roomy third row for my teen/tween-aged kids.  But I did not want anything as big (and costly) as a Sequoia.  The Enclave fits the bill perfectly.   It is roomy and comfortable to ride in.  So far, performance has been great.  I read the criticism about the transmission being slow to downshift, but I haven't noticed anything significant.  MPG was another concern, but on a recent trip, I got over 21 mpg (obviously highway).  For a vehicle this size, I can't complain.  If you are looking for a crossover that combines lots of room with style and comfort, check out the Enclave."
buick,enclave,2009,Bruce, 09/30/2009,Buick Smells Like Gas,3,"I have a 2009 Buick Enclave that I bought brand new in May. I have put 2500 miles on it. I told the dealer after about a week, that I smelled a raw fuel smell inside of the car.  I didn't know it smelled from the outside until a friend told me after driving behind me.  They tried to say it was the evap system but that smells way too much.  The inside fuel smell happens when I turn a sharp corner or come to a stop.  My kids, wife and I get sick when we go on a long drive and have headaches and nausea. It is a raw fuel smell. Like unburned fuel.  Now even under the Lemon Law, GM won't budge as if I'm making this up.  I'll never buy a GM again."
buick,enclave,2009,fueled, 09/27/2009,Fuel Smell,2,"Everything that everyone says about how good this vehicle is, is true.  The vehicle itself is great, but mine smells like fuel occasionally when coming to a stop.  The exhaust tips are super black and I only have 2500 miles on it.  I've been to the dealer so many times that I will never buy a GM again."
buick,enclave,2009,Joe, 10/13/2009,A Great SUV,4,"The Enclave is an excellent choice if you are looking for a premium suv.  We compared to the Acura, Lexus and Lincoln models and chose the Enclave because it has more room than the competition along with superior comfort and performance.  To date, the quality has been excellent and the comfort and ride dynamics have exceeded our expectations."
buick,enclave,2009,Stranded in Seattle, 10/21/2009,New Enclave Engine Problems,3,"I really wish I could love my new Enclave.  This is my first GM purchase and my first American car.  What a frustrating and disappointing experience, so far. In less than a month since taking delivery of my new 2009 Buick Enclave CXL AWD, and with less than 800 miles logged on the vehicle, my new car has been in for service three times for the same engine vibration problem.  The fuel injection system has been cleaned, fuel injector and ignition coil replaced and now the service techs are ""looking more deeply into the cylinder head and valve train."" (YIKES!) Vehicle downtime now stands at an abysmal 50%, since taking delivery. I was so hopeful for GM, but this car simply doesn't work."
buick,enclave,2009,Yellow Jacket Fan, 11/09/2009,1st Class all the way,4,"I was growing tired of my Ford Explorer, even though it was only 4 years old.  It was starting to cost me money in repairs, and it was becoming a rattle trap.  I wanted an upscale vehicle that would seat at least 7 passengers comfortably for hauling kids, but that would still seat adults comfortably in all 3 rows, and would still have some cargo room with the 3rd row up.  I didnt want a mini-van, so I thought I would be stuck with a large SUV like a Suburban or an Expedition, but then I found the Enclave.  Looks great, drives great, rides great, and has nice appointments inside and out.   I have 6000 miles on it, and have not had a single issue with looks or performance.  "
buick,enclave,2009,David Thomas, 12/27/2009,Highly Recommended Crossover,4," I have owned my Enclave for one year now.  I am very pleased with the quality and comfort of this crossover.  Buick has made a true luxury vechicle at a great price.  After researching the Audi Q7, Lexus, Cadillac, Mercedes, and other fine luxury SUVs/ Crossovers, the Enclave offered the most value for all the luxury ammenities."
buick,enclave,2009,smilininma, 01/02/2010,Great fun sporty family car,4,We have only had the car for 9 months but so far we really like it.  The gas mileage could be better.  We are getting about 15-16 mpg but we live up on a big hill and I spend most of the day going up and down it so that needs to be taken into consideration.  It is a great family car and I love that we didn't have to go the minivan route but have the all the room of one.
buick,enclave,2009,Monica Ryan, 01/14/2010,Transmission Ruins Enjoyment,2,I bought the Enclave after two suburbans and wanted a more luxurious vehicle with better gas mileage.  I have been quite disappointed on both points.  The transmission shifts randomly and feels like the entire car is going to stop at times.  It is currently being repaired and I plan to sell it as soon as I can get it to run better.  The car makes an awful grinding noise under the hood on acceleration and in turns which I have been told is normal.  I have had two people ride with me lately and ask me what is wrong with the car.  The car does not leave one with a feeling of confidence or satisfaction.
buick,enclave,2009,chris, 01/25/2010,Fantastic luxury family car.,4,"I bought this car so myself and our family could travel comfortably and this meets that standard completely - Coming from a subaru outback the fuel economy downgrade is considerable however - this car is fun, very big and makes traveling with kids easy. - I highly reccomend to anyone looking for a luxury SUV - I test drove the X5 and other luxury vehicles and they did not have all the features as the enclave plus they were more money. The only downside to this vehicle is you don't get the 15k bmw or mercedes logo - however you do get many more useful features."
buick,enclave,2009,Bob, 02/12/2010,09 Enclave - CXL Great Crossover!!,4,"This one sweet Crossover.  Buick hit a homerun with this vehicle.  We have made 3 trips from NJ to FL in all kinds of weather and the Enclave was secure, comforable and pleasent to drive. It is extremely quiet and rides like a limo.  Highway Gas milege was 18-21 with car loaded and averaging 70-80MPH. We rode through both snow and rain storms and it performed excellent. I would highly recommend it to anyone. We had a Lexus RX350 and the Buick beats it hands down in all areas.  GM has finally woke up!  "
buick,enclave,2009,Freddy K, 04/24/2010,Solid but not stellar,4,Car looks great and lots of compliments.  Gas Mileage is not that great.  Seats need more support.  Very smooth and quiet.  Car need more power and better transmission.  GM Navigation is bad.  We have an Acura MDX and Lexus GS with Nav systems that are light years better than the GM system.
buick,enclave,2009,Connie, 09/19/2010,Luxurious Ride,4,"We love this car EXCEPT for the fuel economy.  We went for something a little smaller than our Suburban to hopefully improve economy while still having enough seating for 6 passengers if needed (rarely).  The car only gets about 12 mpg in town.  On flat interstate it can get 22-24 mpg.  Chrome on dash is attractive but a problem with glare while driving.  Otherwise, we love the car - great ride on those Michelin tires."

buick,enclave,2009,M. Steele, 05/18/2019,My 2009 Enclave,2,"Look up all the extended service repair warranties on the car before you buy one. Many of them leak when raining or in a car wash. Water builds up in the pan under passengers feet, when turning a corner many expletives can be heard. The stereo if Bose is known to malfunction. It's not Bose its the water! Mine had a leak on both sides in the front, the amplifier is under the drivers legs and a small bit of water ran down somewhere behind the dash and on to the plugs. A loud popping noise then nothing. I've replaced it but its not cheap. This vehicle is also prone to these issues and mine has had problems with both, the tranny and power steering. There is a class action suit in CA for the steering issue. If the car drops below 1800 rpm's you revert to manual steering, It doesn't let you know it just does it and I pray your not in a turn at higher speeds. The tranny is notorious for problems. on both they have had to give the customer extended warranty for 10 yrs or 150000 miles. There are a lot of vehicles out there that are more water tight and don't have the maintenance costs the Enclave seems to have.

Now the heater control has gone south.  Haven't gotten it to the garage yet but I'm betting that will be another $1000 and oh and buy the way, the car overheated on the way home from making the appointment to get the heater control fixed.  Also has noisy vibration when accelerating. Almost forgot the plastic tabs holding the floor mats in place break off easily   Looking for another brand soon.

Dealer  CSR said its nornal for that vehicle. I thought the shifting would improve over time with more milage,but its still the same.

Service has no idea how to fix the electrical problems with the car and GM has provided no help.  Examples; turn the car off and remove the key yet the car keeps on running.  Check engine light goes on and the best service can say is make sure you replace the cap when refueling tank.

buick,enclave,2010,Yvonne Davis, 12/04/2018,Should have kept my old Suburban,3,"My 2000 Suburban had over 200,000 miles on it with very very little repairs ever needed. Thought I was upgrading myself getting this smaller, easier to park, but still seating 7 passengers, nice suv. I got 13mpg in the Suburban, this 2010 Enclave only gets 17. Not a huge difference and it's gutless, especially compared to the Suburban. It's been in the shop repeatedly. I paid $17,000 for it used. I still owe $9,000. Beginning of November it went into the dealership for repairs, was $3,400. As a soon as I drove it away I was noticed the noise was even worse than when I took it in. Went right back and made the technician take a ride with me. He said well, drive it and see if it works itself out. So I drive it 4 days until the engine light comes on. Now I owe $3,200 MORE for timing chain repairs. If I had known ahead of time I would be dishing out almost $7000 on the POS in only one month I might have trashed the pile and started over. I can't afford 2 car payments, but could have bought another car with the cost of repairs!  I love the interior of the car. The ease of kids getting into the 3rd row because of the split passenger bucket seats. The ease of folding the back down to the shop at Costco. The ease of parking. But I NEED the dang thing to RUN!

Check engine light will say on for a day or two. It has given me nothing but problems. After spending $4000 in a year the dealer, after having it for 7 weeks, found a connector with 9 wires going into it that was fried, surprised the vehicle didn't catch on fire. They had to seperate it into 2 connector. GM would not acknowledge it was a design issue and it was my problem.

This is a well known issue with GM but they refuse to do anything about it for their customers.  Now it will cost me up to $4000.00 to fix it myself.  I am furious, yes the car is nice, drives nice but not happy that this is a problem they inquired when making this car, it is not something I have done.  I am currently having my power steering replaced for free because they found that it was a safety issue.  Guess I don't quiet understand how the timing chain is not a safety issue when it is know by them that it heats up and stretches, the could break over time and cause catastrophic engine failure, I have heard some stories of this happening as people were driving down the road and car just stops running and no time to get off the road, how the heck is that not a safety issue.

Check engine light comes on frequently in cold weather due to misfires.   Dealer told me to start adding a fuel cleaner every 3000 miles ($16 a pop).  Several times I have replaced some type of computer parts (EBCM will not communicate with PCM,  ECM lost communication with EBCM).  Replaced both front and rear rotors just after warranty expired.  Catalytic converter replaced at 68,000 but was covered.  Pressure sensors inside the wheel went bad.  Dealer wanted to charge me $90 apiece for ignition coils which I found on line for under $50.  Rear liftgate  made a terrible noise while going up, told by dealer that was normal, so I cleaned the shafts and constantly oiled, two years later they came out with a recall on those.  Only get about 1100 miles to a quart of oil, one dealer said that is normal, another said should be 1800 until they started testing, then agreed with other dealer when they found out it was in the low range.

On along trip they get hard on your bottom. We have to carry a small pillow for some comfort.The passenger side will let the passenger slide forward out of the seat. It also lacks the eight way tilts as the driver side and creates leg cramps after a while.The head rests will not adjust and hits the back of a passengers head who's a shorter person. The rear deck lid fails to close many times when using the clicker or the manual electric button. It will go down part of ths way then jump back up.

Two oil changes and 13,000 miles later (first at 3,000, second at 13,000), and that is all the service has been - less than $100.
 
The oil sensor is a nice touch, you only get oil changes when the car tells you it is time too based on driving conditions. It is very comfortable and the whole family likes its features as mentioned below. The teething problems the people in 2008 seems to have benefited the later model years with additional features such as GPS with traffic navigation, more horsepower with the same gas mileage, and overall just a better car with imrproved transmission performance."

buick,enclave,2010,Appu, 11/08/2009,Its Great!,5,Have put in 2000 miles - Has been very impressive so far. Lots of customization/memory features. Gets above 19mpg with 75% local and 25% Freeway. Slow pick up - took time to get used to its rate of pickup. Its very smooth and majestic once it picks up speed.
buick,enclave,2010,tremblay1, 02/21/2012,Poor design features to be aware of!!,3,"Things you should consider: Snow gets trapped in the front springs causing the vehicle to shake horribly until removed, the latch to the spare tire may not release with snow/mud, front cup holders are to close to the front accessory plug ins to be able to use your accessories and use the cup holders at the same time, the ignition cylinder is designed so poor that you cannot have other keys on your key chain with out causing the cylinder to break causing the vehicle to lock up, the passenger seat comes ONLY in a 4 way so long distance trips are uncomfortable for the passenger, cannot access 3rd seat with children's car seat in the 2nd row, Roadside Service is NOT all that you may think it is"
buick,enclave,2010,LDP, 09/30/2016,Outstanding 2010 Buick Enclave,5,"We purchased this 2010 Buick Enclave CXL used in December 2011 with 22,000 miles. It has been a perfect car. Very comfortable to drive, quite, with all the luxury you would expect from Buick. Know wonder why this vehicle is so popular because it is so well made. Plenty room for a growing family and the V6 has plenty of power to accelerate  onto the highway or passing slower vehicles.  This is one outstanding SUV!

buick,enclave,2010,Mark, 11/18/2009,Best 7 passenger ALL AROUND- Hands Down!,5,"Looked at many ""family"" vehicles for 3 kids etc. etc.  Never considered Buick until roadsign caught my attention.  Drove to dealership and WOW finally they got it right!!  Quality, value and convienience right on target.  Configuration of seating and comfort is exceptional.  Quality of design, function and comfort is far better than crossovers costing $10-15k more.  Interior space behind driver is excellent and surprising.  Looking at exterior styling you would'nt think it would be that functional inside.  Great job.  Have owned many luxury cars/suv's before costing $70-$80k. This one has them all beat.  Way to go team GM.. You sold us and we are picky.  "
buick,enclave,2010,MWSTAT, 12/03/2009,Great All Around Car,5,"This is a great car to drive, its very quiet and smooth. It is very stable on ice & snow, much better than my four wheel drive pickup. The Bose sound system is really sharp & crisp. So far we really love this car."
buick,enclave,2010,dmck92, 12/15/2009,Not your Grandfather's Buick,5,"This is an awesome car all around.  We have 3 children and need the third row.  This car has plenty of room, drives quiet and rides like a dream.  Real luxurious inside.  My brother said it looks just like a Lexus inside.  All the needed bells and whistles.  My wife was not interested, because of the name Buick.  She wanted a Volvo XC90.  Then she drove the enclave and loved it.  She tells me everyday how much she loves her new car.  If your kids are growing and its time to dump the mini, this is a great luxury family car."
buick,enclave,2010,Caballero'57, 12/24/2009,Impressed with my Enclave!,4,"After owning a series of high end luxury sedans (BMW, Jag XJL and Cadillac) a growing family necessitated the move to an SUV. After much research, the Enclave was the best combination of space, seating, style, luxury and quality. No disappointments after the first 1100 miles. This is the quietest car I have ever owned-- quieter than my $72,000 Jaguar XJL! The fit and finish is as good as BMW or Lexus. The Enclave rides and handles like a luxury car, not an SUV. The Enclave is a tremendous value when compared to others. "
buick,enclave,2010,FrozenTundra, 03/25/2010,Our new family Enclave,4,"My wife and I have 3 children ages 5, 2, infant and we have previously owned a Town & Country as well as a VW Tourag. We test drove just about all vehicles that seat a family of our size and hands down we enjoyed the Enclave the best. The ride is wonderful and my wife and I fight to drive the Enclave (over the BMW 745Li). The ride is sturdy but sporty and the interior is very quiet and comfortable especially for a crossover type vehicle. Despite some complaints I read during our vehicle research I find the turning radius and overall maneuverability to be excellent. The Enclave takes the many railroad tracks in the area with ease and the electronics features in the Enclave are fantastic."
buick,enclave,2010,Mike, 06/13/2010,Buick Enclave CXL2 FWD,4,"Purchased vehicle 4 months ago. Since then, exhaust system had to be replaced due to a harmonic vibration that could be heard while accelerating. Vehicle delivered with imperfections in paint (Tri-Coat Color). Two bubbles are visible and GM is still deciding as to whether the entire left side of vehicle will be repainted or take a chance that there is no air beneath bubble. Engine has a rough idle and is loud compared to foreign vehicles I've owned. Vehicle oversteers somewhat."
buick,enclave,2010,Happy Enclave owner, 08/31/2010,"Wow, what a SUV!",4,"After owning Chrysler built minivans for 24 years, we purchased the 2010 CXL 2 Enclave August 4 and have 1900 miles on it.  It has been flawless to date.  Got 24.2 mpg at 55-58 mph during 500 mile break in period on trip. Since then, 22-24 mpg at 65 mph on trip. The Enclave is so easy to drive, is whisper quiet inside, totally rattle free,  and has a very classy exterior appearance as well with the new gray-green paint,  chrome wheels, and Michelin Latitude tires."
buick,enclave,2010,joe ciccone, 08/03/2010,What a Rush to drive a Buick Enclave,4,"Excellent vehicle, fun to drive, very comfortable.  Drove from Montreal  QC. to Hallandale FL. and back in 15 days.  very powerful on highway. excellent acceleration  smooth ride and very  very low road noice. Averaged 21 MPG at 80 MPH. Enclave is a huge vehicle and you do not feel tired after driving 14 hours a day. Drove through 100 degree heat, AC. worked well. drove in heavy rain and in foggy mountain conditions and had no problems. 18 wheeler truckers do not intimidate. What a rush."
buick,enclave,2010,Ruk, 11/12/2010,Great Crossover,4,"My wife wanted out of her Odyssey minivan so we started looking at crossovers. The Enclave has more features than most other crossovers at a great price. The ride is smooth and comfortable.  All of the controls are easy to use and intuitive.  Sliding second row seats are a nice touch and allow easy access for our 3 kids and friends.  GPS takes some getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, it's easy to use.  Gas mileage is poor, but we knew that going in.  Overall, not as much storage room with 3rd row up as the minivan, but my wife is much happier, so I'm happier.  Very pleased with this purchase."

buick,enclave,2010,jl, 12/12/2009,Very nice crossover,4,"Bought it about a month ago, and so far so good.  Took it on a long road trip and it was pretty comfy (18 hour drive).  Hwy MPG was around 22, which I think will improve over time.  XM radio and OnStar are fantastic.  Bluetooth is very convenient.  Rear backup camera took getting used to, but love it now. Vehicle is 4800 lbs, has very safe, solid feel.  Very quiet inside, beautiful outside."
buick,enclave,2010,calpilot, 12/18/2009,"As good as my marks, not too sure",4,"Great Car, very versatile and looks great.  We own a white tricoat and the big problem is the metallic plastic bumper paint chips easily.  No dice on getting touch up paint from dealer.  We were told that vendors are holding back afraid of GM's financial position and they (vendors) don't want to get caught making products for a bankrupt company.  Read other reviews around the internet about all parts for repairs being on long back orders because of limited vendor parts.  So far all we are in need of is touch up paint, keeping our fingers crossed that will be all."
buick,enclave,2010,vmi88grad, 01/07/2010,Almost the Perfect Crossover,4,"We test drove this car in 2008 when we needed a new family car. For those with a family of 4 or less, this car will be excellent. For a family of 5 with luggage, this vehicle is entirely too small. In 2008 we chose the top of the line Chrysler Town and Country 4.0 limited, which had far more space, and at that time even better acceleration. Since 2008 the Buick has improved the power of the engine and transmission is now smoother.  The 2010 Enclave is a pleasure to drive.  Smooth quite ride, good acceleration at all speeds, solid handling for a large vehicle, great turning radius, and elegant look.  There is plenty of leg room for adults in all three rows of this car. Handles well in snow. "
buick,enclave,2010,buick owner, 01/10/2010,"Like it, BUT.....",4,"This car has a lot gong for it.  I purchased it because I wanted a seven seater vehicle, with an aisle down the middle, that wasn't a minivan.  My prior car was a Mercedes R500 which I loved, but felt I needed more storage room and additional seating capacity.  Compared to the ride of the Mercedes, driver seat comfort and handling in the snow this car doesn't compare. The Enclave does have a superior navigation and entertainment package, as well as, heating and cooled seats.  I think the biggest drawback to the Enclave is the transmission on a incline.  The car rolls back or forward when on a hill, almost as if you were in a manual transmission vehicle, when you take your foot of the break. "

Thank you Buick!  "
buick,enclave,2010,Charlie, 02/05/2010,I love my SUV!,4,"I was indecisive in choice. Acadia, Traverse, Murano and Enclave were my top 4. Value for price paid made me select the Enclave hands down. Acadia was second, but for $550 more it was a no brainer for the luxury SUV. The quiet ride is so impressive, as well as the power. My only disappointment is the cargo room (lack of) when the 3rd row is in use. Where is my spare tire??? lol I still can't find it! My only problem is that I cannot fix why my FOB doesn't recall my driver's seat and side mirrors."

We needed more seating but were not willing to give up that luxury feel.  My husband and I went in to test drive a Denali and the salesman showed us the Enclave.  My husband, family and I realized this was the perfect car for our family of 7.  The 7 passenger, sliding seating is so functional & the styling and comfort are on par with Mercedes.  Having spent $80000.00 on the Mercedes, we felt spending $46000.00 on the fully loading AWD Enclave was a bargain.  We are so proud to be driving American!"
buick,enclave,2010,brucemaz1, 06/11/2010,Well rounded family vehicle,4,"As a family of 5, we had a base Nissan Armada which we liked, but decided we needed more features and better gas mileage. Looked at CX9 among others. The look of the Enclave beats all- comers in our opinion. The technology is extensive and the warranty is solid. Only had it a short while, but very happy so far. Only issue is idle is set so low, it can roll back a bit on inclines when taking off if you delay hitting the gas - simple awareness addresses the issue and it likely lends to the decent fuel economy. Super quiet. During delivery we did not know it was running while sitting in it. Drives smoothly."

Have had to replace the power steering pump, the a/c actuator twice, the struts, the tail liftgate, and now they are saying that the timing chain in the engine needs replaced which will cost $3000.00.  GM should cover this due to it being a recurring problem on the enclave. Lots of other smaller issues. ..disappointed in fuel mpg...will never own another GM.

buick,enclave,2010,Darlene, 07/26/2010,Electrical Issues,4,Purchased my 2010 Buick Enclave in August of 2010 with less than 100 miles.  Enjoyed it until recently when the electronics started to fail.  While driving the dash would fail and the a/c would stop cooling. Now it fails to crank off on on and the dealership states there is nothing wrong with it!
buick,enclave,2010,jamiec, 10/04/2009,No Regrets At All!!,4,"Started looking at the Traverse, then the Acadia.  Did not look at any Buicks' due to the ""grandma's always drive buick's.

buick,enclave,2010,sweet1976, 09/04/2009,I lUV MY VEHICLE,5,"I absolutely love my new Enclave.  The rear backup camera on the rear view mirror is an absolute delight.  It is so much easier to look in the mirror than down at a navigation screen. There are so many things that makes this a great vehicle to have. Granted, I've only had it a few days now, but I can't say anything negative about it.  It's very classy and I see people's head turn when I drive by.  The only negative thing I can say is about how expensive it was to purchase...but nevertheless, I'm pleased!"
buick,enclave,2010,GC, 09/10/2009,Great car for the whole family,4,We really love our new Buick Enclave.  It is a really comfortable and quiet ride.  The DVD player with Wireless headphones is great.  We can listen to music while the kids are watching a movie.  The inside of this SUV is almost as roomy as a minivan.  The Kids can actually stand up in the back.  There is still room for storage in the trunk with the third row seats up.
buick,enclave,2010,JBayer, 09/22/2009,Excellent 7 Passenger Crossover,4,I have owned this for just a couple of weeks and have decided that this is one fine vehicle.  Good acceleration and very acceptable gas mileage for its size.  The ride is very good.  Seats are very comfortable though the 3rd row seat could only accommodate a large adult in the middle seat.  The two outer seating position would have to be for smaller adults or kids.  All the bells and whistles work great.  Plenty of storage area with ac jacks for a game or other brought from home device.  If you need to seat 6 or 7 and want something in a very nice and luxurious crossover I can highly recommend the Enclave.
buick,enclave,2010,norm wibel, 09/29/2009,2010 Buick Enclave,4,"Needed a ""cruiser"" to replace my 2003 GMC pick-up.  Made up a Likes & Dislikes spreadsheet and went shopping.  After many test drives, the Enclave won out.  Really like the smoothness; the shifting; the acceleration/downshifting; where my knees rest on a long trip; and, the styling.  Some vehicles tested had reddish instrument lighting which, was difficult to see during day - and, impossible to see with sunglasses on!  So far, at 1200 miles I'm averaging 19mpg; it usually takes 3000 miles to get a true reading."

After 6 weeks and not much choice I like them. Been 9 years since I bought a new car so subjected to lots of techie changes, especially the Navigation Package that had not been updated to my State so getting weird directions. Overall I find the vehicle overpowering with use of Plastic, even the grill; I'm sure this is done to reduce weight & cost.  The interior is where my major complaints are: Cannot position steering wheel for clear view of dash,  ""Driver's Info Center"" no compass or Instant Mileage Indicator, Clock too small, no digital speed, no secure gas cap, no glove compartment lite."

I am very, very disappointed. My Ford and Toyota got exactly or better than sticker. Shame on GM for not doing better.

buick,enclave,2010,pabhs01, 01/07/2010,Nice Car - Not Carseat Friendly,4,I like the way this car drives and handles.  I am extremely disappointed at how this car is not family friendly for young children.  I have 2 children in carseats and 1 in a high back booster. We got the bucket seats in the 2nd row to make it easier to get to the 3rd row for my oldest(booster).  The 2 Britax carseats are installed in the second row.  They were very difficult to install satisfactorily because the car headrests are not adjustable or removable and are tilted forward. The bases of the carseats do not sit flat on the seat no matter how it is positioned.  The booster in the 3rd row covers the seat belt clip in every position - they are very narrow. Not a family friendly interior!
buick,enclave,2010,Rich, 02/08/2010,Amazingly Quiet,5,"We purchased the Enclave because we often drive from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, and need something more comfortable for the long drive. We are amazed on how quiet and comfortable it is. The engine is very strong and never has to struggle to go up the hills. Passing is very easy as well. You only have to press the accelerator lightly to get a quick response."
buick,enclave,2010,bayerjv01, 02/20/2010,Very Nice Vehicle,4,"Had this 7 months now and it has been very reliable.  More than adequate power, very comfortable and quiet.  Fuel economy is good for a vehicle of this size configured to seat 7.  I wish I got the AWD version - too easy to spin the tires on the FWD.  Using mapquest and sending it to your GPS via Onstar is cool.  Rear entertainment system has been well utilized.  The power lift gate works well and I don't know if I would want an SUV without one again."

DVD player works great for the kids, seats move easily (my 5 year old can move them).  ONstar is a great feature.  Fuel economy could be better,but it's exactly what the sticker says, so really can't complain.  Couple of snows so far and it has performed as well as our Jeep.

It seems to turn a lot of heads for a car that is not really a new model.  Many people complain of fuel mileage. I get 18-19 overall and 22.6 at 75 MPH. I doubt that many cars this big that will haul 7 with comfort will do this good."

Summary: I had test drove Pilot, MDX, RX350, Sorento, VeraCruz, SantaFe, Highlander, Acadia, Traverse and Edge.  For the size, comfort, range, performance, convenience and price, the Enclave stood out among its competiton IMO) - this selection was not only a surprise to me but those who know me as well - particularly since I have been a Honda/Acura person for many years.  The Enclave is a very nice car and if I had to do it over again, I would purchase it again."
buick,enclave,2011,kb5868, 05/13/2014,Good MPG for it's size,4,"I bought a 2011 Enclave with only 20k miles after my lease was up on my 2012 Infiniti EX35. My Enclave gets a consistent 17 mpg in town compared to 15 mpg for the EX. It is easily twice the size of the Infiniti, the primary reason for not getting another EX lease - no one could fit in the back seat!
 So, for a vehicle that is nearly as large as my Yukon Denali, I'm fairly impressed with the gas mileage. everyone has their opinions, but I was puzzled by all the comments about how 2-3 mpg was bankrupting people that bought $45k cars and were considering $60k cars with better MPG to make up the difference. Different econ class than I had in high school I guess...LOL! "
buick,enclave,2011,staugustine1, 08/12/2013,scary,4,"I have had my Buick for about two and a half years now and love just about everything about it.
It is comfortable, responsive, hold lots of people and things.
My only concern is about six months ago my ""service air bag"" light came on.
So I promptly took it to the dealer where they had it for several days and repaired the faulty piece.
While I was there I asked the service tech if the airbags would still work if the light was on and he told me NONE of the airbags would have worked in a crash.

The light came back on again today so I am bringing it back to the dealership to have it fixed for a second time. This is not some thing that I find acceptable in a 2 1/2 year old car."
buick,enclave,2011,rvanparys, 06/19/2011,Best in It's Class,4,"We wanted to move from our minivan to something more compatible with our long NW winters. After many weeks of in depth research we finally decided on a GMC Acadia. The dealership also featured Buicks. After test driving both my wife and I came to the conclusion that the Buick outshown the Acadia in fit and finish and overall quietness and ride.

I found the car responsive and while it will never be the first one away from the starting line, it does have the requisite power on demand
to pass safely.

The ride is exceptional as is the quietness. Both of these were prime concerns for my wife.

The interior is well laid out and materials above average.

I would highly recommend this car"
buick,enclave,2011,LMR, 09/14/2017,"Smooth, roomy cruiser, hit-or-miss reliability",4,"After test driving leading competitors (Mazda CL-7/9, Ford Flex, Audi Q/7, etc.) we settled on the Buick for its superior ride quality and capacious size.  I'm a car aficionado and this is the nicest riding vehicle I've owned or driven in.  We purchased a 1-yr old 2011 CPO vehicle and until late summer 2017 all was well.   The only previous issue was a leaky engine gasket covered under warranty.   At our 100k mile check we found: broken engine mount, leaky strut, and HVAC stopped cooling turned out to be a cracked rear AC evap core.  Online forums show this was a common issue into 2013 models, and repair costs $1,000 - $1,300 for either front or rear.  So at 100k miles we've a $3,500 repair tab.   The car has been great to date, but as it ages I'm questioning whether or not we too will begin to experience the transmission problems reported on the forums.    PROS:  Exceptional ride quality, excellent interior room (more actually than my Tahoe), good safety rating, outstanding traction in wet/snowy conditions, great dealer support   CONS:  adequate but not exceptional power, GM leather seating quickly shows wear compared to other brands (same happened in my Tahoe & those of friends), weight keeps mileage middle of the pack, tight power train packaging complicates maintenance/repairs (over $300 for spark plug change!?!).   Time will tell on continued reliability and eventually resale value of our Buick.  It's a great family or road trip vehicle, and overall a positive experience.   It might not be the type of vehicle you keep beyond 100k miles

the axle bearings and several other things. Thank goodness we had bought an extended warranty so we have not had much out of pocket

Its nice looking and has all the features Ive wanted. The MPG is terrible. The worst thing about this car is its an absolute lemon. The first few months I had it the airbag lights went on. It was in the shop multiple times and they finally had to rewire the airbag system. At 12000 miles the engine light came on and car shut down 4 hours away from home after waiting 5 hours for roadside assistance they towed me an hour away. I got a loaner car and had to leave it up there. It ended up being a bent valve and the head had to be machined. I got it back 3 weeks later after having to drive back up 4 hours to get it. I have a problem with the gas guage that I still have it was back multiple times(they replaced gas tank) and it still does it. It shows 1/4 tank when its empty. Ive had multiple front end components replaced. It runs rough(like a miss) and tach jumps been back multiple times they tell me all the tachs do that. Now charging system is not working replaced battery must be alternator. The car has 52000 miles I bought it in today (thursday )to make appointment. They cant look at it till Wednesday at the soonest, So I dont have a car again. The car is paid off in another 5 months!! So now I dont have a car again. Maybe I should just leave it at dealer.

It could be better I suppose, but I expected 20mpg average and that's what I get.

We bought it to transport my teenage daughter and her friends around and it's been a great success. They love the luxurious leather seats, the sound system and the great ride. The back seats fold down in a variety of ways and you can transport pretty much whatever you want. The main drawback is the awful fuel consumption on the AWD version, which is less even than the 15 mpg Buick claims it will get. Our lease runs out at the end of 2014 and we'd like to buy the Enclave, even though it will be a bit big for two people, but I think we'll downsize to a BMW X3 or the Audi Q5 just to save money on gas."

buick,enclave,2011,rusgc, 10/07/2011,Follow Up On Earlier Review,4,"Just completed 3500 mile trip with new Enclave, I'm adding to earlier review.
Ride is excellant and it's quiet.
It's a big car, I didn't get used to the size as
I thought I would with driving time.
Poor outward visibility, and lack of maneuverability
in tight spaces, i.e., parking garages, and busy parking lots is my biggest complaint.
Gas mileage is disappointing, hoped for rated mileage at least, but it's 1 or 2 mpg less than rated.
Interior conveniences are either lacking or too small to be useful.
 We've had minivans for years, nothing beats them for travelling convenience so I'm biased on these points. 
Overall, it's a comfortable, nice, if not exciting or ""fun"" to drive, car."
buick,enclave,2011,flablueovalfan, 09/27/2011,"Quiet, refined, but...",3,"There is much to like about the '11 Buick Enclave. It provides a serene, luxurious ride. However, there are a few inexplicable and obvious nods to cost cutting that do not belong in a $50,000+ vehicle of this class. I particularly dislike the fact that the front passenger seat cushion adjusts front to back only - no angle adjustment! And is it to much to ask for some ambient interior lighting - like my $15,000 less expensive '11 Mustang GT has? A few bits of interior materials could be better - too much hard plastic. I had the Ford Flex with Eco Boost higher on my list, but the wife was put off by the styling. The Enclave is a nice car, it just needs more attention to the details."

Limited visibility will also take some getting used to.
Very comfortable seats.
Gas mileage so far is disappointing, less than rated.
My opinion on this and most cars now is the electronics are way over done.
Too many ""features"" that aren't necessary.
Huge gripe is the lack of hanging hooks inside rear doors, instead they are half way back by the 3rd seat or cargo area.
Totally inconvenient for hanging dry cleaning,
 and the bar I use on vacation to hang clothing.

We were only the second owner, no crash history, I though it was the best. Literally loved it and babied it. Took great care of it.  Then the ac went out within the first year. Got that fixed. Then after that we constantly had to put oil in it mkre than usual and change the pump. Then at 2 years of owning it, it started going into limp mode. Took it to get repaired and was told ut was the timing belt. So we dropped a lot of money on that to get it fixed only to turn around after not even a week of having it back and driving it maybe 3 short trips, it started making this horrible sound and died on me literally right before my driveway. Cranked it up and slowly crept down the drive and parked it. Called the company we had been using to relair it the next day to come tow it back to see what the problem was because at this point it wouldnt even crank. Was then told we would have to replace the motor. Right at 155k miles and had to replace the motor which cost us another pretty penny. Money we literally did not have. It stayed at the shop for almost 6 months. The company was having a hard time getting it fixed and diagnosing the problem. We finally got it back and decided to trade it in for something else. It was doing nothing but costing us money. We probably payed 3/4 times more than what the car was worth and still OWED money to the company we bought it from. Apparently (coming from the mechanics) they see so many buick enclaves with transmission and motor issues at 120,000 or higher miles. They literally told us when we picked it up the last time after we replace the motor that they were no longer going to work on enclaves because it costs THEM money. It was a great suv up until it ate our savings. Not only are we out of the money we payed to get it fixed (TWICE) but also out of what we owed and the 8knthat we had already payed on it.

buick,enclave,2011,Texas Driver, 11/24/2010,Buick Enclave dream machine,4,"After so many years of owning Japanese designed cars I decided it was time to try American cars again.  Finally the American auto makers are back on track with terrific and extremely competitive products!    The Buick Enclave is a beautifully designed and built car, it has all the bells and great technology along with superb driving comfort!   Perfect for my family and flexible in design to meet my needs (somewhere between a car and a pickup with a minivan thrown in is basically what I needed).  Excellent styling in and out.  Excellent layout.  EXCEPTIONAL ride!  More power than I expected and so so on MPG, looks like it's around 17 to 18 around town.  Top 5 star safety rating -it's a WOW!"

Have not owned a Buick since 1995, been driving Hondas, but I am glad to say I am back in a Buick."

buick,enclave,2011,C. Hall, 03/16/2018,Love my Enclave,5,"As a ""big"" person, the only problem I've had with this 2011 Enclave was the driver's seat base.  It has separated at the seam and I can't get it to snap back into place.  One of the mechanics at the dealership told me it's happened before to all types of sized people he knows and it couldn't be fixed.  Other than that, I haven't had a problem with this car.  I love my car.  But since it's over 7 yrs old, I'm ready for a new one since I'll be doing a bit more driving these days.  I'm hoping to get another Enclave.

buick,enclave,2012,Kevin E., 05/22/2018,"Oh, how we loved you, until you let us down",3,"We were so happy to get our Buick Enclave 2 years ago.  It rides very nice.  It is quiet.  The seats are comfortable.  It is easy to drive.  While on a trip out west, we noticed the engine feels underpowered with 4 people and luggage traveling through the Rocky Mountains.  It struggled going up some hills.  All was well though until we hit 68000 miles.  It started with the engine shutting off while driving.  The power steering went out when this happened making it very difficult to try and steer to get off the road.  After this happened 3 times in 2 days, we took it to the dealership.  The power steering pump needed replaced, the timing chain needed replaced, and a cam shaft was bad.  This came to around $12000.  Thank God we purchased an extended warranty when we bought it.  It was all covered except for the deductible.  After going through that, the vehicle then started making a strange noise whenever we would turn the wheel.  The brake booster is also going out.  At this point, we decided to trade it in on a new GMC Acadia.  I strongly recommend if you buy a used one to purchase an extended warranty.  They are known for having timing chain issues (which I did not know when I bought it).

Water pump failed at 75k miles. Engine and transmission failures at only 90k miles.  4 months ago (Jan. '17), had a fuel injector failure... GM service tech strongly suggested that all 6 by replaced at same time ($2400). OK,..happens. However, just diagnosed with a failing transmission (torque converter & transmission) in April '17.

The lease deal was way to good to pass up. Paying $333/mo for a $39,200 SUV with free Onstar, free maint, free XM radio for the whole 24mo lease! The Enclave is BIG, it drives BIG, goes down the road BIG. Power is ample for a heavy SUV and the 6sp automatic shifts very well to get you moving. Its got style, function, and looks. Very QUIET and chews up miles with ease. The MPG could be better (I am getting 17 city and only 20-21 HWY) but its only got 5,000 miles on it. Driver and passenger comfort are great, love the middle captains chairs, and 3rd row is fine for 2 adults or 3 kids."

Original owners almost never keep maintenance records . I bought one with 95000 miles on it and it needed a lot of work done because the first owner neglected to take care of the mechanical issues . The Lexus dealer in cool springs was supposed to do a 141 inspection on it according to their list sheet . I found too many things they overlooked and did not mention on the sheet.  Tire where bald, front brakes down to the metal, rear brakes almost the same, brake, antifreeze, power steering, and transmission fluids never had been changed ....  Front motor mount was leaking oil , engine missing at low speeds and needed plugs .  Battery was 6 years old and not holding a charge very good ..  After spending around 4000.00 to bring it up to speed I an now be safe to travel in it .. Gas mileage is about 18-20 in town and almost 24 on highway . I liked the vehicle because it's very comfortable .   But the Lexus dealer of cool springs  did not prepare it like their inspection said when they did it ... i  would never buy from them again because of their dishonesty about the vehicle ..  they do not care about their customers safety with any used car they sell..

We have never owned a Buick product before so we thought we would give it a go.  We fortunately had some factory warranty left on the vehicle when we purchased it and thankfully bought a 1 year extended warranty that covered major components.  A few weeks after purchase we noticed a flutter in the engine, a hesitation.  We took it in and found out that it needed an expensive part for the transmission and new struts...Our factory warranty covered the transmission part, and our extended warranty covered the struts.  A few months after that we noticed that the RPM needed was jumping around when traveling at 45-50 mph...Took it to dealer and they said it is a known issue that happens when the temperatures are high (we live in AZ) but does effect the engine...so we would just have to deal with that.  Then 8 months in, the AC went out and needed a manifold hose..our factory warranty had run out so our extended warranty covered it.  We are VERY nervous about this vehicle once the extended warranty has expired because we really don't feel like we can trust it  not to cost us a lot in repairs.  I will probably trade out of it once the warranty is up.

buick,enclave,2012,Kevin, 06/12/2019,Questionable,3,"I bought the 2012 leather sport model, 81,000 miles, AWD at the beginning of 2019 and I'm the second owner. First week the power steering went out on the highway at 70 mph which almost caused us to crash, it was very unstable on the highway due to rear shocks, replaced them, then all the lights came on saying malfunction of the stabilink system, motor misfiring, no power from the engine, transmission shifting so hard I thought it was going to drop the trannie, dash lit up like a Christmas tree with every light on saying something is wrong including the brakes. Found spark plugs were fowled out and caused the engine to go into limp mode which then causes every system to go hay wire. Reset the computer after replacing the plugs and everything came online no problem and truck was perfect. Then a month later we go on vacation and suddenly on the highway dash lights up again all crazy and display says stabilink malfunction and shut down which we were in the rain at 70 and it caused the truck to start fish tailing when we were driving straight and all the other issues started back in. Luckily we were almost back from the trip and I'm a mechanic. Hooked my scanner up and found #3 cylinder coil pack had failed and the motor went back into limp mode. If you are thinking of purchasing one make sure you have deep pockets or can repair it yourself if not dont buy one because it's one of the most expensive vehicles to fix that are one the road. If i couldn't fix all these things myself I would have thousands and thousands of dollars in repairs.

After 5 seat cars, we are really enjoying the space and can now carpool with others and bring the dog on trips.
I wanted captains chair in 2nd row and 3 spaces in 3rd, and most SUV's can't do that.
It could always use another USB port but we juggle just fine.
My only major complaint so far is the milage.
This winter it has been averaging 16.4 miles per gallon.
This thing chews through gas like you wouldn't believe.
Over the summer, it was slightly better, but we were doing more highway traveling.
With nothing but metro driving, it is sobering how much we are spending on fuel.

Clearance is ok, but check measurements - this is lower than hoped."

It was worth all the time and energy.
This vehicle is easy to drive, loaded with extras, very comfortable and doesn't drive like an SUV at all.
With the rear camera and parking assist, there are no worries backing out of my driveway or parking spots.
The A/C cools rapidly in our very hot summers with very high humidity.
It has a very tight turning radius and when this is combined with the variable speed steering - she is a breeze to manuever.
I have received so many compliments when people see my new vehicle that I have lost count.
I have fully enjoyed the first 6 weeks and
look forward to many years of enjoyment."

buick,enclave,2012,mspeach789, 03/27/2014,No cell phones in Front Seat,1,"Updated review:  I will never buy a GM Product again based on my experience with customer service and incompetent technology.   How would a buyer know if you could have a cell phone or a large drink (in the cup holder) in the front seat?   The service notices are not easily available to buyer.   I now drive a Lexus.   And behold the phone and the iPad and the laptop do not interfere with the seatbelt or air bag deployment.   

The seat belt alarm keeps going off in my 2012 Enclave.
The dealer gave me a service notice ID 3120743/ 08-09-41-0071.
This states that any electronic device in the front seat or audio cords or large drinks will cause the seat belt alarm to ping.
This is NOT TO BE REPAIRED.


If you want a cell phone, iPad or audio cord in the front you have to click the seat belt.
GM can not give me any assurance that with said interference the air bags will deploy.
GM Customer Service stated ""The Vehicle is designed to do that""
REALLY?
I don't think so.
They inadequately shielded the module and now don't want to fix it.

buick,enclave,2012,Sophie, 03/21/2019,Never thought I’d own a Buick... but,5,"Okay so I never thought I would own a Buick. But we were searching for a family vehicle that was large enough and wasn’t a giant suv, or a mini van. Voila, we found a 2012 Buick Enclave with 3rd row. Who knew? It seats 8! The rear and 3rd seats are adjustable and folding. Big plus! The rear cargo space is very nice when 3rd row is folded... can still fit suitcases and luggage when using the third row... but we ended up getting a roof rack cargo box for trips.  The seats are relatively easily lifted up to clean under them, which is great when you have kids. The next plus was that it is AWD. We love in WI and this was a must for us. And after a nasty winter here, I can say I admire the awd of my Buick. I’m used to driving a Subaru and this stood up pretty good! I didn’t slip, I had continual traction, and it seemed eager to plow through the snow. The next big thing for us was the fact it can actually tow! We made sure it had a tow package, and it can easily handle a pop up camper. It has a fancy little switch on the dash for towing. We still had a smooth ride despite towing a big gawky camper behind us!  We did not get one that has any extra gadgets on the inside (no dvds, or naviahtion) but I would rate 9/10 for it.

 Two issues with the Enclave: the first is the head rest.
For whatever reason, my neck is never comfortable regardless on how I position it.
Also, it does not lock into place so whenever someone climbs in the back and grabs it, the headrest gets knocked out of position.
The second is the NAV system.

 The big selling point of this vehicle was supposed to be the Intellilink system with enhanced

I bought our family's 2013 Enclave new and had a couple of smaller light bulbs burn out while still in warranty.   The kicker came when a headlight bulb only lasted 3 years.   Just know that that little bulb will cost you nearly $1000.00 when they both burn out!   Buick should be ashamed of this.  And unfortunately, this means we have no choice but to head back to non-American cars when we get a new car this spring.   Good bye Buick, I'm not in the business of these kinds of surprises.

buick,enclave,2013,Kate, 10/29/2019,Constantly in for repair,1,"We purchased a 2013 Enclave in 2016 with ~49K miles. We've consistently been spending money to repair this vehicle. Twice, the dashboard lights start flickering, the dashboard goes black, and the vehicle dies. Both instances of this didn't not register any computer codes, mechanics at the dealership had to guess at the problems, and it took 3 tries to get it fixed. Additionally, the AC requires recharging every summer, twice. These issues represent only some of the times we've taken this vehicle in for repairs over 3 years with costs now exceeding $5000. Forums suggest we are not the only Enclave owners struggling with this.

I left this company for dead.
I just bought a 2013 Enclave AWD, leather edition and all I can say is WOW.
The fit & finish is right up there with Lexus or Mercedes.
They didn't short cut as American manufacturers generally do.
I can't believe that this car is even American built.
The car handles great and the ride is smooth.
I especially love the Nav/electronics of the vehicle and it seems that Buick is up to date with these features.
The led rope lighting the circles around the top of the dash and front doors is a nice touch at night."

Called the dealers around my area and got the worst respond to how they can help and one of the dealer never called back at all. finally talk to corporate office and they suggest to take the car in to find out what is going on and they were going to help me in repair because the mileage was over 70000. We decided to take it to local mechanic shop to take the engine in part and repair this way we save money. They find out one of the valves spring was broken and land it on top of the piston and cause all the problems. I never heard the engine stop working in 71500 miles because GM uses all made in China parts. This was my first American made car and last American made car going to have. Never will buy another American made car again.

buick,enclave,2014,Rattler, 10/03/2015,Believe in Quite Tuning,5,"The Enclave is an EXCELLENT value. Very quite, very smooth, spacious, well appointed, comfortable, elegant appearance, perfect drive train package, excellent Infotainment unit with redundant manual controls, no service issues, excellent gas mileage for the size of the vehicle. Does it get any better?

Update after 2 years and 12,000 miles. I would not alter my previous ratings. We have enjoyed the Enclave as much if
not better than any vehicle we have ever owned. Not one service issue, that just might be the best part.
Still believing in quite tuning.

Update after 34 months and 15,000 miles. First vehicle I have ever owned with NO service issues. Loving it!

Update 4/2017..Deffective battery...premature. OnStar saved the day...excellent service. Vehicle running in 1 hour. WOW!    
On a rainy Sunday to boot. No charge....warranty.

Update 10/2017.....Very satisfied with vehicle. Looking to purchase a revised/restyled 2018 model unless it has stop/start engine...a deal breaker.

Update 4/26/2018.....After over 4 years and 20,129 miles. Still enjoying the Enclave as much as ever. Right headlamp bulb replaced out of warranty. Purchased Delco bulb from Amazon for $130.00 and installed it myself, easily.  GM dealership quoted $556.26 total for replacement.  So sad we couldn't purchase a 2018 Enclave due to stop/start technology.

Update 11/5/2018......Just got back from a long road trip. We drove 12 hour days and were pleasantly surprised how we didn't get fatigued at the end of the day.The Enclave is a wonderful road car. No service issues. Current mileage 24652. Considering purchasing a 2018/2019 Enclave since aftermarket now offers
a device to disable the ridiculous Start/Stop feature.

Update 5/6/2020,  mileage 25602, Enclave performing perfectly. Still no service issues..amazing.
Wonderful vehicle on road trips. If only I could buy a new one without start/stop feature.

buick,enclave,2014,bshapiro1, 03/09/2014,Excelent Luxury Family SUV,4,Loving our Enclave. Is exactly what we expected. The interior is large and comfortable. There is ample space in all three rows for adults to sit comfortably. Ride is smooth and quiet. Definately feels like top quality craftmanship. Handels well for a vehicle of it's size. The blutooth connection for phones is great and we can easily stream music.
buick,enclave,2014,ugnaut, 08/23/2014,Luxury at Value,4,"We went looking for crossovers we first looked at mid-small size ones. The big issue for my wife was comfortable seats and a little luxury if you drive a lot of miles. Its hard to find in the 20-30 range. We actually like the Encore but that was about 30 with the leather package with no deals. 
We looked at higher price/luxury cars from Acura, Audi, BMW, etc.. We ended up with Leather package Enclave at around 40k after discounts, rebates. We didn't want to pay 50K+ for name only, the Buick was a nice middle ground between luxury and value. We ignored features such as Nav and more electronics which everybody always complains about on most brands, besides the Iphone works as well. See favs. "
buick,enclave,2014,enclaveguy, 03/10/2014,"Luxurious, but Nav system needs work.",5,"This is my 2nd Enclave.
My first was in 08, the introduction year.
I've loved it since.
I have the 2014 model & it's equally as nice with more bells & whistles.
 Overall, I would rate the Enclave as excellent.
Its quality and luxury at a fairly affordable price.
The Enclave is a heavy vehicle, so the power on the 2008 model seemed to be lacking, but the 2014 seems to have more power to get up to speed on the freeway.
 The interior color options seem to be lacking however, kind of funky for my tastes and I am not in love with the fake plastic ""wood"" trim inside.
Buick missed the design mark on this.
 The navigation system leaves a lot to be desired as it is not very intuitive. 

Update 03-14-16:  My original opinions above still hold true today.  I love the Buick Enclave.  I've had no issues in the past two years, other than the Nav system still needs to be reworked in my opinion.  It's not intuitive and the touch response is a lacking.  Sometimes you really have to push down on those virtual buttons to get the system to respond.   It needs a complete redesign.  I'd rather log into my phone for navigation and GPS.  The Buick Nav just doesn't cut it.  You set something and then months down the line, the system defaults to the factory setting.  I didn't push anything (I think!!), but yet my saved settings seem to change on their own.  You can't ""pinch"" the screen to make it smaller, there is no touching the screen to move the map over, you have to use the presets.  If you pinch the screen like you would with your cell phone, you end up flipping the map upside down and try not to get into a car accident trying to reset it!  Not at all intuitive.

I just learned that my Enclave needs $4,000 of engine repairs at only 50k miles!  Apparently there is a manufacturer defect in the timing chain that has damaged my engine.  Of course, It’s no longer under warranty.  This is unacceptable!  I will never buy a GM car again.  Stay away from this ticking time bomb!

buick,enclave,2014,ckaushal, 07/07/2014,Front Collision Alert needs improvement,5,"Overall the car is great but the FCA system still needs improvements. When I started driving the FCA system was detecting collision warning bet the red flash and beep was not working. After few months for some reason it started working again. Either Buick did and update or they system may have some algorithm that learns with time. Now some times it falsely detect the front collision from the cars driving on opposite lanes on turns/curved roads, that does not bothers me. So far no mechanical or electrical failures. We took the car for couple of longs trips (>2k miles) and it was very comfortable and gave us no trouble.
One more minor issue I noticed so far with gear shifting at low speed when driving uphill. For some reason I felt little jerks during gear shifting, it felt like car got confused with gear while driving up 
hill, especially if while driving uphill you let the gas padel go and press it again quickly, the car thinks hat you want to stop and if you speed up again it give a weard jerk. It happened to me few times but it's ok with me as I don't drive much on hills.

buick,enclave,2014,phenry, 07/09/2018,Smooth ride with great styling,4,"It took me a long time to convince my husband that I really needed this car!  Not just wanted the car, I needed the car!  Eventually my dream came true.  I love my 2014 Triple white diamond Buick Enclave with leather.  The pro's are, room enough to carry just about whatever you may want with the ability to fold down 2 rows of seats, a smooth ride, a quiet ride, classy styling, and most creature comforts at your finger tips.  The cons, high price tag, not so stellar fuel economy, large and bulky to maneuver in tight places.  Yes, the latter being true to the point of passing up parking spaces to find one a bit less convenient, but at least with enough room to swing the vehicle in place.  With that said, now that I have been driving this vehicle for 2 years now, I have learned to except the small flaws and be content with all the positives this vehicle has to offer.  I travel often and having a car that makes driving enjoyable is important to me.  Its also extremely important to drive a car which makes me feel safe in the event of an accident.  I have enough car around me to feel quite substantial and a bonus are the many airbags in place should something happen.  Recently my husband offered to buy me a new car, something a bit smaller, but I would have to like it better than what I have and I am not sure that's possible!  Time will tell I suppose, but for now, it's me, my Enclave and the highway!

Since I bought this car I have had major neck issues. The drivers seat neck rest is extremely uncomfortable and has created ongoing issues. I am upside down on the lease and have been told by two dealers that there is nothing they can do. Yet I understand they completely changed the head rest design in the newer models. My husband refuses to drive it because it is very uncomfortable for him as well. Does anyone have a solution or similar issue? I still have over a year left on the lease.

This was covered under warranty.  Bumper to bumper warranty ended in February 2018.

She complains about the fuel economy which varies from 19 to 23 mpg but I'd be happy as a pig-in-$%(t to get that kind of mileage out of my truck.

It is currently in the shop where they are replacing the motor-mounts and have replicated and are trouble shooting the transmission slippage. They are most likely design/quality issues.

buick,enclave,2015,Elwyn Davis, 05/21/2016,Update after almost 2 years of ownership,5,"Here is an update prompted by Edmunds after 2 years and 10 months of ownership with about 46,000 miles on our 2015 Buick Enclave.    We have not had any problems with this automobile at all in this time and over these miles.   Unfortunately, we now have a more comfortable ride in addition to the Enclave, a 2017 Buick Lacrosse.   However, that doesn't mean the Enclave is less comfortable than it was.  

I wrote a review of our 2015 Buick Enclave after 22,000 miles.  It was our second Enclave, and it won't be our last.  I was prompted by Edmunds to write an update.  

I wouldn't change a thing from my previous totally supportive review, other than like a fine musical instrument, it seems to be getting better with age.  We are getting slightly better highway mileage than we did with our 2008, often getting 22-24 mi per gal, and we have the all wheel drive.  

It is a comfortable on trips as any automobile in which I have ever ridden.   Around town it absorbs bumps and pot holes very well.  There has been plenty of room for any use we have found.  It has the same interior space as our 2008, which we used for a week's vacation in Colorado for a week carrying 4 adults and 2 grandsons and all of the stuff we 6 people needed.  

My only suggestion to Buick would be to bring some of the technology features more up to date in refreshes of this wonderful vehicle, such as keyless entry, push button start, and power sun shade with 2nd row seat sun roof.  But these are picky little things, far outweighed with the delightful driving experience and usefulness of the vehicle.  With the 2008 and 2015 we now have over 130,000 trouble free miles of driving.  

If you are interested in a near luxury, super comfortable and reliable, spacious people hauler you should seriously consider the Buick Enclave.
"
buick,enclave,2015,Paul Horvick, 11/24/2015,Third Impressions,4,"This is my third posting.  We recently completed a 4987.5 mile trip with the Enclave, from Arizona, to South Carolina, to Florida and back to Arizona.  I now have more extended time in the car, and can fine tune my thoughts.

The good news is that, on the road travelling, the car is superbly easy to drive, very nice ride, and a feeling of safety and substance.  Gas mileage on the highway was also very good, with an overall 26.5MPG for the trip.  All worked well, comfort was very nice.

The sound system is excellent. The BOSE system and radio was superb.  When you also have a very quiet interior even at highway speeds, this was an easy car to be in and drive.  The lane deviation system is a very nice feature, particularly useful on the highway.  The blind spot warning is also a great feature, particularly when side and rear vision is less than ideal.  The forward collision warning system was not in play, but seems like it would be a good feature.  The ride, on the highway, is controlled, serene and quiet.  (Unlike city driving, where the ride was harsh...feeling every road imperfection.)

The navigation system is not particularly intuitive (although when set correctly it was helpful).  One very annoying thing is that when our iPhone 6+ was connected via USB, the radio automatically defaults to the music on the iPhone and you must manually go thru the menu to get back to what was on the radio.

Front seats are comfy, supportive and good for a long ride.  The automatic return to a seat setting was very nice, as were the heated seats and heated steering wheel.  Cruise control worked fine, but more than once I inadvertently turned on the heat to the steering wheel rather than engage cruise control.  As noted in an earlier post, the middle row of seats is a joke.  Compared to our Sienna van, the seats were uncomfortable even for people that are well under 6' tall.

I really want to like the car.  It is good looking, cruises well, and gets good MPG on the highway,  But....the ride is harsh in town, about 15MPG in town, and the lines of sight in the rear and sides are awkward, more so in town driving.  The rear seat comfort also is very poor for a car in this price category.

We bought at the end of the 2015 model cycle; it had an MSRP of $47K, and we paid just over $37K.  Buick also has a fairly decent reliability rating, and the 48mo warranty is a plus.  Lots of good things about the car....a few that are poor.  But, if the rear seat is not a concern, and perhaps without the towing package the city ride would improve, it is a safe and good looking car.

buick,enclave,2015,C. Ferguson, 09/07/2015,This is a GREAT car!,5,"I was shopping around, currently was driving a 2011 Chevrolet Traverse.  I liked what I was seeing on the highway in the Enclave so decided to give it a trial.  Boy was I pleased!  I was offered $7500 off and got exactly what I wanted.  This SUV drives like a dream, great acceleration and it is very sporty on the highway.  I don't have to let off the gas much going into curves.  And what a nice surprise on gas mileage.  Averaging 23 mpg on the highway and 21 in town.  Electronics work well.  A few bugs but not enough to get into a twit about.  Great sound.  I got a towing package and plan on getting a small travel trailer to do some weekend trips.  I am completely satisfied with this car.  The only thing I could say negative is the rear seats could be more comfortable for what I paid for the car.  Love it!

buick,enclave,2015,CW, 12/05/2016,Best value for the size! Fits a lot.,4,"I did a lot of research before checking out this SUV in 2015.  I wanted to lease an SUV to fit my bicycle inside, that's decent looking and under $5,000 per year on average (excluding gas, etc.).  This car fit the bill with the massive discounts applied, so I went in to check it out.  

It is comfortable, and actually was cheaper than all other SUVs of similar stature (leather interior and AWD with navigation), even cheaper than the lower tier brands like Ford, Honda, and Toyota.   

All the seats are comfortable. 

I had it for a 39 month lease, and returned it to get a fun car.  I would have kept it if I had space for an extra car and it didn’t depreciate to less than the buy off value- all because it just fits so much stuff!
"
buick,enclave,2015,Paul Horvick, 08/21/2015,Early First Impressions,5,"We spent some time looking to replace our 2011 Toyota Sienna.  Looked at the Toyota Highlander, new Honda Pilot and the Enclave.  Because of a bad back, getting in and out of a car that has a high floor lip, or low ceiling is hurtful.  The Enclave is a perfect size for ingress and egress with no back strain.  In fact, the seats are marginally higher than those on the Sienna (and we loved the Sienna).

The car was delivered with radio issues; it would not accept the signal from Sirius/XM to put it into subscription mode. A neighbor also just got a new Enclave and had the same issue. I am sure it will be resolved, but it does speak to the necessity of having a good warranty that covers the electronics (and, at 48 month warranty, it is excellent.)

Steering is heavier than I would have thought; not really an issue, just an observation.  The interior is quite plush and upscale; quiet.  Kind of the old school luxury feel.

Many consumer reviews comment on how comfortable it is on the go.  I would say that is a matter of opinion.  Our Sienna rode much better and was much less truck-like.  Even in town, you notice every bump.  Granted it is a soft bump, but somewhat disappointing compared to the Sienna.

Controls, although there are many due to the sophisticated technology, are pretty intuitive.

Sight lines forward are great; rear mirror vision is less than the Sienna due to rear headrests etc.  Passenger side sight line is poor.  The ""blind spot"" warning system is nearly a must have option.

One odd thing, and it is a negative in my view, is that there is nothing stopping anyone from opening the gas cap.  I would have assumed that at least some basic security would be in place, but nope...just push the cover and it pops open.  Easy for sure, one less thing to go wrong I suppose, but I like the security of an in-cabin release.

Resale value of the unit is (based upon a cursory review) rather typical of American vehicles. However, if you buy at the end of the model year, there are big discounts to be had.  Ours had an MSRP of over $48000, and the cash price was $37000, and that puts the later resale in a much more competitive mode.

It is a good looking SUV, and comes in a nice range of rich looking colors and interiors.  We have the dark brown, and it is very rich looking.

Time will tell if we made a good choice with the Enclave. As much as I want to love it, I am disappointed by the harshness of the ride.  I won't downgrade the review for that, because it is so subjective. But, if you are expecting a cloud like ride....it is not there.

buick,enclave,2015,Does it matter?, 11/01/2015,Quiet and smooth,5,"Bought a fully loaded model in September of 2015. I'm fairly tall and leg room was a big concern for me, so my options were somewhat limited. We wanted a mid-sized SUV but ended up with a large SUV because we liked the comfortable seating so much.

The ride is great! It is exceptionally quiet and smooth. You can spread out and make yourself comfortable. The engine is a bit undersized but I don't push it so it works fine. There aren't enough cup holders up front for such a big car, my old Toyota Seqouia (sp?) had about 100. And the space for storing stuff isn't all that good. I added an aftermarket cell phone holder which really helped. We charge our phones from the back USB ports to save on clutter. The interior looks luxurious. The AC seats rock, but I wish they were stronger. My biggest complaint is the driver side seat has something that pokes me in the thigh and is uncomfortable - I plan on addressing this at my first (complimentary) servicing. The sun roof is small but doesn't blow you away when open so I ride with it open almost everyday.

Mileage is terrible. I drive in So Cal traffic everyday and knew this before buying it from other reviews. 

The infotainment system is pretty good, but the favorites could be a little easier to work with. The navigation system is a joke. Voice control is non-existent even after taking it to the dealer to get it fixed. Not the biggest issue because I trust my cell phone navigation more anyway. Swapping from my phone to my wife's phone via Bluetooth is easy. I plan on not renewing the satellite radio because I can get everything I need from my cell phone at a fraction of the cost. The Bose stereo system is fantastic - makes me wish I listened to louder music. Needs to have a push button start; it has everything else, I'm can't believe they left this out. The remote start is a nice feature.

Safety features like blind spot detection and front collision warning are extremely helpful. The rear backup camera is very helpful, but I have seen clearer cameras on other vehicles.

Tons of space on the inside! More storage than we commonly use. 

Suggestion: if/when you buy this car make sure you speak with a knowledgeable salesperson who can show you the features.

I would buy this car again.

buick,enclave,2015,DMZ, 12/29/2015,"Two years and 38,000 Miles....",5,"Still loving this Enclave for all the same reasons listed on my previous reviews!   Buick really put this SUV together with much thought and the timeless values and features people appreciate in a car like this.  Solid, confident, smooth, hushed ride on the road.  Wonderful space.  Controls and amenities are placed intuitively  in the cabin.  Driver's perch just right.  Spacious feeling behind the wheel - open.  A pleasure to drive.  I've had many people tell me ""what a sharp car"".  It is very stylish for an SUV with the 20 inch wheels and front lighting.  Wish the engineers could help carve out more mpg's - but this is a large, heavy vehicle.  Back up camera very convenient and I would highly recommend the blind spot alert that I have.  IMHO, this needs to be a mandate on all cars these days.  Beautiful feature.  As I have said before, BRAVO, BUICK!!!  I could not be happier!!!!

buick,enclave,2015,Jeff Jaco, 02/24/2019,2015 Buick Enclave- Big Let Down As Warranty Ends!,3,"Car did fine until about the time the warranty expired.  First at around 48000 miles (Warranty is for 50K miles) the audio amplifier stops operating.  Thinking that car is under warranty, I take it to the dealer only to learn that the warranty is four years or 50K miles which ever comes first.  Replacement of the amplifier is around $800.  Less than a week later following a rain, I notice that the rear wiper will not turn off.  I simply pull the fuse and say, I can live without the rear wiper.  Saturday of the same week, the car will not start and the steering wheel will not lock.  I have to mess with the thing for an hour turning it on and off, shifting in and out of park, checking fuses and so on, before finally it starts.  Note the battery was not the issue as all other electrical items on the car functioned normally.  Then on Sunday, as I am leaving a baseball game, the car looses all power in the driveway of the parking lot and will not move.  I place the car in park, turn the key off and take the key out of the ignition switch, but the engine keeps running.  Ultimately, I have to disconnect both battery cables and short the cables together to get the engine to stop.  This must have reset the electronics, since I reconnected the cables, got the car started and drove it to the dealership.  Again, the engine would not turn off at the dealership,  but this time it would still move.  Disconnected and shorted the cables a second time which again stopped the engine.  I left the battery cables disconnected, locked the car and left it there. Now trying to decide if a stay with this car, with Buick, with GM, change brands or try a foreign made automobile.  All disappointing!!!

This is an update on the above post.  What I had not recalled at the time of the above post, was that in January 2019, I had the windshield replaced because it was cracked.  The Buick dealership determined that the windshield was leaking and water intrusion is what appears to have been causing all the issues with the electronics in the dash area.  The Buick dealership did an excellent job with the car's repairs and helping me deal with the windshield replacement company.  The windshield replacement company say they will reimburse me for the repairs which now total $1,812.00 including the audio amplifier.  We shall see.  Buick has redeemed themselves in my eyes and I intend to stay with the car and with Buick for the foreseeable future.  If the windshield replacement company  does not follow through on their commitment, I'll be back.

buick,enclave,2015,Gross, 09/13/2015,Our 2nd Enclave,5,"We had a 2009 Enclave for 6 years, made over 70k miles driving around town and family trips, never had any issues, travelled even long 12 hour trips comfortably, no backpain or soarness, nor excessive exhaustion. We shoped around but always came back to the Enclave. In the end were between waiting for the new generation or going for a new current version. In the end because of the many upgrades done to the current version and finding the exact vehicle we wanted, along with the attractive incentives, we decided to go for it. 
We absolutely love the ride, the suspension is a little better, the shifting became a little smoother, overall all the improvements, new facia and dashboard along with the color combination and better sound system are just great.
We are very pleased with the vehicle and looking forward to enjoy many family trips in years to come. The only complain is GM cutting back on the warranty, which I can't understand on a matured product other than cost cut for increased profitability. 
If you are looking for a full size family vehicle with lots of space and a firm ride, yes I drive sporty, this SUV pulls it together. Surelly there are other more sporty driving SUVs out there but perhaps not as spacious, quite, and comfortable.

buick,enclave,2015,C J McNair, 06/12/2018,Road Trip Perfection,3,"This car is the largest vehicle I've ever owned - in fact, for around town driving, it was too big.  We no longer have the car.  We absolutely loved the car for road trips.  Amazingly comfortable ride on the open highway.  Amazing room and comfort in the front seats.  A pleasure to drive on long trips.  Huge amount of cargo space.  Like a limousine.  Don't try to back it up, park it, make tight right hand turns.  The backup camera was terrible - I never once used it and was able to back up straight.  Rear visibility was a challenge.  Took out the left rear tire many times trying to make a tight turn.  Navigation system was a nightmare to try to use.  It worked only now and again.  Since the majority of our travel was around town, we decided it wasn't the right car for us.  The best comfort in a road trip I've every had.

buick,enclave,2015,drraz, 05/24/2017,Like driving a sofa. :),4,"The driver's seat is so roomy that at times I feel lost in it (and I'm a 5'11"" female, not a small person at all). Would be great for anyone needing a roomier driver's seat. The 3rd row is the reason I bought the car... it is SIGNIFICANTLY roomier than the other cars I have owned, borrowed or rented. (I've ridden in a 3rd row in an 2014 Honda Pilot, 2015 Ford Explorer, a Toyota 4Runner, etc). The only thing I don't like about the car is the infotainment system. It is SO not intuitive, and every time I try to do something new, I literally have to google it or look in the manual, bc it's overly complicated. Also, you can't pair the Bluetooth once you have taken the car out of gear. I mean, not even if you have it back in park! Why not?! If I am pulled over and parked, I should be able to turn on the Bluetooth and listen to music. But I literally have to turn OFF the car and turn it back on. Ridiculous! I rent cars a lot when I travel, and I have NEVER had to pull out the manual to set up the entertainment system, or pair my phone, etc. ONLY in the Enclave. Very odd.

buick,enclave,2015,Paula Phipps, 01/17/2016,Behind times,3,"They need to let the retro clock go.  Move electronics up as it is now you have to take eyes off road to hit buttons.  Buick engineers should take lessons from other auto engineers.  The electronics could be simplified.  Why would they only put cup holders in door of second row.  Everyone knows cups don't work in door cup holders.   To lay third row seats down you have to move second row of seats forward.  At that price range they should be electric.  I will be glad when I hit 50000 miles and we trade.   Never buying Buick again here.  Gas mileage is better with ford explorers.

buick,enclave,2015,Paul Horvick, 09/06/2015,Second Impressions,3,"I wrote the earlier review shortly after we took delivery of the vehicle. It was (and is) a solid vehicle. But...I am downgrading our 5 stars to 3.  We apparently did not do a great job in test driving it.  In addition to the less than smooth ride noted earlier, the middle row of seats are, for most adults, very cramped and uncomfortable. My wife, about 5'6"", complains that the leg room is really tight when the front seats are all the way back.  I tried it also (I am 5'10"") and would never want to ride in the middle row.  (Yes, we had the middle row moved back as far as we could).  So, couple the relatively harsh ride, the inadequate middle row seating for adults, then this becomes just an average vehicle...one that had we done better due diligence, we would not have purchased.  Yes, good looking, quiet, nice technology, ...a solid feeling car....but one that, in hindsight, we should not have purchased.  Before buying, do a better job of test driving than we did!

buick,enclave,2015,Amanda J, 05/28/2019,Major Issues,2,"Unfortunately, I had to rate this gem a 2 because of all the issues I had. I absolutely loved the features of this suv in regards to luxury and comfort but nothing but issues. Fist known issues were the brakes. At 50,000miles needed all new brakes, pads and rotors. I always felt like I was ""slamming"" on my brakes just to stop. Needed a new battery at 80,000miles. Died on me several times after battery was replaced. MAJOR ISSUE: I had water leaking out from underneath my dashboard ! I was told maybe it was a plug in my sunroof drain, as the tubes run under the dash but it was never fixed? MAJOR ISSUE: One day I had just shut my car off, as I thought but it was still running, that's right, keys out of the ignition, engine still running and drivable! My car was literally running ""on"" for 45 minutes to an hour with no keys in it. INSANE! Finally shut itself off. I let the suv sit for an hour after. Started right up and was able to make it home however the radio would not turn on. Next day, nothing, would even turn over at all. Couldn't even unlock it! Put my keys in the ignition and then I couldn't get them out! Had it towed for the second time...started right up at the dealership! CRAZY! If I were to diagnose an issue with this suv I would say its electrical which is next to impossible to find the fix let alone the solution. Among talking to other Buick Enclave owners, the sunroof issues was present in theirs as well, as well as major engine/transmission issues right about 60,000miles. Honestly, I'm very upset because I absolutely loved my Enclave. It was sharp looking, drove very nice, and very affordable. But beware of these issues. Traded in at 94,000miles, Hadn't even put on 50,000 miles, not even owned for a year :(

buick,enclave,2016,Brian L, 12/02/2015,Very quiet. Smooth riding.,5,"This is the quietest vehicle that we have ever owned and it is a SUV. (We have owned many, many vehicles over the years and all bought new.) Quality SUV & materials for far less in cost than other luxury SUVs. 
     Front wheel drive is rated at 17/24 mpg. So far best that we have gotten pure highway is 23.1. Hopefully will improve somewhat. 2500 miles on it so far.  Acceleration is acceptable to pass and go up hills. 
     Overall we are very happy with it. One option that we got was lane departure & front end collision warning. Leather edition comes with blind spot warning and rear side collision alert. Thus loaded with safety features. Also, a middle air bag.
     One issue that we are not happy with is the ""hanger"" hooks are in the 3rd row. Can't use exit handles in second row since they are on the back of the front seats and not on the roof. We like to hang clothes on clothes bar when we travel but this is a problem other than just 10-12inches of such if using third row. With cars we put clothes about 50% across and still had good vision out of the back window. Third row and second row both fold down flat for storage.

At 46,000 my ""low oil"" light came on.  Sure enough - the oil barely registered on the dipstick.  The dealership told me that I need to have my oil changed more often, even though I have it changed religiously and have NEVER been overdue.  They also told me that the owner's manual instructs that customers must check the oil at every fuel fill up.  (Shifting the blame to me?)    Here I am - 3000 miles later - and about to take a road trip.  I checked my oil and it barely registers on the dip stick.  Apparently I am driving a $40,000 vehicle that has an engine that burns oil.  There are no oil leaks on my garage floor, so it must be going somewhere.  We will be taking my daughter's 2009 Pontiac on our road trip because I feel safer with us going far from home in that.  There is also a LOUD bang in the back floor.  I have taken it in and they ""can't find it"".  The repair tech could hear the noise when I called in to schedule the repair using Blue Tooth - it's that loud!  How can they not find metal banging together.  A waste of money.  I recommend purchasing a different vehicle.

buick,enclave,2016,Jon McSparron, 08/21/2016,Love our Enclaves,5,"This is our 3rd Enclave and they each get better.  Love the seating, and storage.  Wife hauls a lot of items when doing Prison Ministry work and she can still get 4 people into very comfortably .  I like the vehicle for over all appearance, and variability.  Good vehicle for us as we haul grand kids around and three car sets with 4 grand kids is not a problem.  The entertainment system is great when traveling any distance with them as they can watch DVD's and not bother us in the front seat.  Only hang up I have ever had is getting at the spare tire.  Would not want to do that when the back is full of groceries or luggage as access to the lowering nut in under the storage bin at the rear of the vehicle.

Have had an issue with the rear cooling system leaking.  Dealer knew exactly what was wrong and had it fixed under warranty.

buick,enclave,2016,Hank W., 01/20/2016,New Buick Enclave,4,"This car is larger than most so called midsize SUV's.  Electronics at this trim level may be intimidating.  You won't be able to instantly use all features without reading the owner's manual,...several times.  There are very few features the cares does not have.  It's loaded.  The only complaint so far with the electronics is the navigation system.  It doesn't understand my southern dialect.  Half the time I have to manually key in destinations as opposed to speaking them.  I hope that time will enable the system to learn my voice.  Creature comforts are impeccable.  Seats are a little stiff compared to my Town Car but I expect them to loosen up over time.  Leg room is the best out there, bar none, particularly the second row seating.  Even the third row seating is adequate for relatively short trips.  Noise levels are on a par with most luxury cars, quiet.  Power is adequate for a vehicle this size but will not snap any necks.  So far, fuel economy is on the low end of the manufacturer's estimate, about 16 around town, 18 overall.  I have only achieved 20 on the highway.  so far I like the car very much.

buick,enclave,2016,Steve H, 09/22/2016,1000+ miles across the Northeast,3,"I've owned two Dodge Durangos (first a 2012 V6 model, now a 2015 RT Hemi) and found myself spending a week with the Enclave during a work trip. High points of the Enclave are generously sized cargo and seating areas, smooth freeway sailing, and overall comfort. The cargo area seems to be quite a bit larger than my Durango.  However once you get off the interstate and onto the twisties, the Enclave shows it's weak spots. In my rental with 20,000 miles, the transmission hunts for gears, is slow to respond, and can be clunky as it tries to keep up. Switching to low for engine braking on steep downgrades is not terribly effective in this vehicle, nor is it smooth. Low speed cornering is controlled and predictable, but at moderate or greater speeds there is quite a bit of body roll. Getting into technology - the audio system (this one did not have Nav) was not intuitive. I'm sure you get used to it as you own it, but the system of menus and sub menus seemed oddly organized. Dodge/Chrysler is miles ahead with the UConnect system, and I would also rate this well behind the system in Toyotas that I have rented. THe interior material quality also is not what I expect for the price range. Granted, rentals do get abused, but the high gloss console surfaces appear to be easily scratched, and the dull black plastic center stacks look cheap. Lastly, there were a number of odd noises that I would not expect from a new vehicle with this mileage. Creaks and groans from the suspension were noticeable over the rough roads of New Jersey. To anyone considering one of these, I urge you to check out the competition closely, especially the Durango (I feel that the Durango handling is worlds beyond the Buick, and with the V8, so is the power). You can do better than the Enclave for the money.

buick,enclave,2016,Displeased Owner, 12/14/2019,Below Average SUV,2,"Bought a 2016 Enclave Premium AWD on 12/24/15. Transmission went out at 58k in 2017 (something about a 3-5-R body cover cracked) left us stranded after what sounded like an explosion while sitting at a stop sign. Now 83k miles, when shifting from 1st to 2nd gear, engine will rev from 1700 to 3800 before engaging in 2nd gear. Pulling up to a stop, gently braking and without notice, the transmission will jerk the car hard on the downshift to 1st. The action is hard enough to make everyone think the driver is about to hit something.  At 35 mph, engine feels like it is lugging, throttle response is delayed, transmission feels as though it's not sure what to do when gas is applied. Originally ride was very smooth and quiet, now on new smooth asphalt ride is still quiet and smooth; on concrete road noise beginning to creep in and ride starting to become noticeable more jittery. This was happening before replacing the tires, new tires didn't affect the situation either way. Not sure why perforated fabric was put in place to cover the sunroofs but in winter lots of cold air comes down on everyone (no wind leak, just feeling the cold coming down from the glass). Storage is good with 3rd row stowed. Entry is easy, unless the driver seat periodically moves up as far as possible, seat is slow to move back to original position. If you press the button to move the seat all the way back for the driver to exit the vehicle, the 2nd row passengers have difficult time getting out if anyone is in the 3rd row. I wear a size 12 shoe and have had it get stuck between the driver seat corner and driver kick-panel, have to make sure toe or heel of shoe goes out past seat first. Navigation system likes to change the view as you are driving down an open road. It might be on full screen when you set it up then it's in half screen mode with the radio station showing up on the right hand side and the map on the left hand side. After a while it may change to a different view or just stay the same. Front air dam under bumper is too low, will hit when pulling into a parking place that has a curb. You don't know the black plastic piece has contacted anything when pulling in, once you back out you can hear it flip over and drag off the concrete, so you have to park without getting very close to a curb or concrete wheel stop. Seats feel like you are sitting on a cinder block, very flat and no contour or support to them. Twisting roads are not an impressive riding in the Enclave body lean is pretty noticeable. Some days the engine is completely gut less, other days it's normal with not having the strongest of engines. At 65 into a head or cross wind expect 18.5 to 19 mpg at 65 mph, in town driving is 14 - 14.5 mpg. We have 2 grandchildren that ride with us everyday one in a car-seat, the other in a booster seat; anyone trying to get into the 3rd row with child-seats in place is in for a challenge. Seatbelts in middle row lean into the passenger's hip when buckled, with a car seat in place fastening the seatbelts causes you to pull the car seat toward the door to make clearance for the buckle to line up properly, then with the child in the seat push the seat into a level riding position.  No I will not buy nor look at another Enclave.

Or did Buick cheapen up the 2017's to begin building the 2018's (that  won't be out for a couple months yet)?

buick,enclave,2017,Marie, 09/11/2017,Buick luxury,4,"Beautiful car. Terrible gas mileage. $70 a month and I'm retired so don't use the car daily. REALLY wish that it had front end collision protection but that is on the next higher model. Lots of technical goodies that I don't understand. I have to take my eyes off of the road to make adjustments very dangerous. For example the rear windshield wipers are controlled by a switch UNDER the radio. You have to look down to use it. Much worse than texting.  Controls need to be moved up to within eyesight and radio needs to be moved down.  NEEDS a bigger brake pedal. My foot is frequently slipping off of it. I'm 63 and 5'2"" and might be different for others.  The brakes have a problem with lag. If you press them gently they don’t react until you press harder. Very disconcerting. I actually love the car but it needs a redesign especially on the dash controls.

buick,enclave,2017,Erik, 11/13/2017,Love the car but not reliable,2,"We bought the car new with 24 miles on a Friday.  Drove it on a roughly 200 mile road trip over the weekend and Tuesday the power steering goes out.  We take it to the dealer and they keep it until Wednesday afternoon and tell us it was the power steering pump that was bad.  They say they replaced it so we thought the problem was over.  Thursday my wife says the power steering is out again.  I drove right to where she was and by the time I got there it was working.  Friday morning everything worked great and then Friday afternoon around 2:00 it went out again.  This time I was home and felt it.  The dealership picked it up from the house because we refused to drive it until the problem is fixed.   We have been very disappointed with the purchase because we love the car, the interior , the exterior, etc.  but now we have a car that we payed a lot of money for that my wife is scared to drive!!  We are probably about to start lemon law paper work as the dealership refuses to trade it for what we payed towards a different one.  They are offering around $8,000 less to swap to a different Enclave.

Greta car design, too.

buick,enclave,2017,Patrick, 02/09/2018,Good Value1,5,"Gas mileage is not the greatest.  19"" tires stupid idea. So few cars have this size that they are unreasonably high. If they were 18"" they would be about 1/3 less.  Engineer that located the oil filter should have a Louisville Slugger busted across his knees. Front seat a little firm for my aging back but remedied with a memory foam cushion for long drives. Other than that a wonderful car, our second and would buy another. Picked the Enclave over Cadillac and Lincoln for room and comfort. I feel there is little else either of the previous mentioned cars could have given me that the Buick now provides. I would recommend one to anyone looking for comfort and at 6'4"" leg and headroom are paramount.

Controls are dated as is the level of safety equipment. It is smooth, quiet as a Buick should be but the interior could be a little more luxurious. It is best as a highway cruiser and grocery wagon.

buick,enclave,2017,Jim, 10/12/2017,Driver Information Center,4,"Had a 2012 Enclave and liked it. But on my new 2017 the DIC has been reengineered and controls work only sporadically. There is no longer a click or other sound to indicate the control has been effective. If often takes many touches and hard pushes and even then does not reliably work. Dealer was very helpful but no defect was found, just poor engineering.

Over 17000 miles and I still hate the DIC. It is unreliable You have to take your eyes off the road to see if it accepted your command. Previous DIC was mechanical and once you heard or felt the click you knew the command had been accepted. Irritating

The interior and exterior are pleasant improvements. The navigation system is still terrible. We bought the 2017 because it can be towed behind our motor home.  The new Enclaves cannot be flat towed. My wife loved her 2010 and that feeling carries forward to the 2017. Buying a 2019 or 20 model car that offers Buick luxury and can be flat towed would cost $20K more than the price of our new 2017.

buick,enclave,2018,Kevin, 11/04/2017,Buick Enclave Avenir beats the imports,5,"The 2018 Buick Enclave Avenir just arrived in AZ the last week of October.  I had been looking for a car for a year to replace my 2012 Lexus RX 350.  I was about ready to give up on finding a car with a good ride, that is quiet, has room for adults on long drives, and is still able to fit in a parking space.  Oh yeah, and it had to have a decent engine.  These are the attributes of the Lexus brand, but I find the new Lexus just mean-looking.  I test drove all SUVs:  Honda, Toyota, Porsche Cayenne, Audi Q5 Q7 SQ5, Chevy Traverse, Jaguar, Acura, GMC.  I like to think I pretty much covered the universe and I liked the Buick best.  It is extremely quiet and yet has the guts to handle a high speed pass 70 to 90 smoothly.  The long wheel base and great suspension give it a very smooth ride.  This was not the most fun car I drove, but it was the most practical.  We don't need the 3rd row often, but I like the immense storage with easy parking.  BTW, the most fun car was not the Porsche, but the Audi SQ5.  I would highly recommend it for a sporty 2 row.  Buick has upped its game and matched the prestige badges with a 4 year, 50,000 mile warranty.  The Avenir trim is worth the money over the premium.  Looks better and seems quieter.  If any of my checklist matches yours, go drive the Buick.  Update after 1 year of ownership:  The weird shift pattern for the electronic shifter is just plain dumb.  There was no reason to change. Way too easy to shift into Park while moving.  Transmission can get lost on rare occasions while shifting.  LOVE the car overall.  I would buy it again.
"
buick,enclave,2018,Disgusted, 10/28/2018,In the shop!,1,"Bought the 2018 Enclave last month. 2 days after purchase, vehicle would not engage out of low. Called and dealership immediately sent a tow truck to pick up the vehicle. Did not find out the cause, even though 8 error messages were recorded. Was told the vehicle was reprogrammed and had no problems when they drove it. 232 miles worth. Went 2 weeks without an issue.   3 days ago I could not back the vehicle out of the garage. After repeating putting the vehicle in reverse, then park 5 times,  I decided to put the vehicle in D with my foot on the brake then transition to R. This procedure worked.  I backed out of the garage and drove straight to the dealership.   That was Thursday morning. This is Sunday. No solution yet. Both issues have to do with the transmission. I will NEVER buy a GM vehicle again.  
Update-Received a call from the dealership today. (Monday). GM engineers gave them instructions on what to look for. Dealership could not fix the problem. Engine light still displayed. Sent those results back to GM. Have to wait on GM for next step.  Talk of putting me in a new vehicle because if they can’t fix the problem, the “Lemon Law” will take effect.   Will update with final result.
"
buick,enclave,2018,toyota420yrs, 08/01/2018,It’s been 2 years,4,"No additional issues. 
I initially wrote about a AC problem which was fixed with no repeat problem.  Maybe a fluke issue. Since then my only issue was that the onboard computer had to be rebooted twice due to various issues.  A little concerning but with all new cars so computer reliant, I’m thinking it’s not too uncommon. Overall, I still love the car while keeping my fingers crossed for the long term reliably. I have small issues with some design flaws.  One being the wind buffering inside with one window open. With the soft sunroof cover, it flaps wildly while closed becoming noisy  and annoying.  Also,  the clip to keep the sunroof cover closed appears to be from a 99cent store.  I have no faith it will last the life of the car or even 3 yrs of constant use.  
Overall,  Still optimistic and still enjoying the car and ride.

buick,enclave,2018,Bob Quick, 09/15/2018,"Road Warrior, Great in Snow",5,"We bought the 2018 Buick Enclave Avenir in February 2018,  by September we had 17,000 miles.  So have had some time to get to know the car.  It is very quiet, capable and comfortable.  It is outstanding on the road, handles well in all ice, snow, rain, black ice conditions, as well as on dry road.  Evens out the bumps, very comfortable on road trips, ride and noise cancelling are exceptional.  It is the least fatiguing car I have ever had, I arrive after 5 to 10 hours of driving relaxed.  Averaging almost 27 MPG, have had several tanks that were over 30 MPG.  The FWD works great and is more than adequate for most snow conditions.  The AWD also works well and is good for snows up to 10-12 inches, over that it gets high centered.  It is sure-footed and handling is very measured on icy and wet curves.  I should add that my wife likes it much better than her BMW X5.  Ride is vastly superior, oh and it burns regular!  In short, a very happy owner.  Oh be sure to buy the deep rubber all weather mats, they are great.

March 2020 update, we now have 2 years diving experince with the car and have logged 51,000 miles.  It is without any doubt the best car we have ever owned.  Other than routined maintence it has been trouble free, with one exception.  In May 2019, after pulling away from a parking lot, the car started to buck and surge llike a bronco.  My wife and I were terrified, turned the car off and had it towed to the dealer.  They said ithere was programming fix which GM hoped would fix the problem and it largly did.   About 5 months later, there was some hesittaion in upshifting on hills at low speeds, once again.  They reprogrammed the transmission control module with the lastest software update and there have been no issues since then.  

Overall, the vehicle is excellent, nimble and controlled when pushing it in tight curves, great highway cruiser.  Great predictable handling in the ice and snow conditions of northern Wisconsin.  One sugestion for GM, wtith the 20 inch tires, sometimes the snow will build up in the wheelwells.  If they could add a heating element to the friont wheelwells, this would eliminate the bounching problem and the need to chop out the accumulated ice and snow.  A heating element for the front windshield wipers would be useful as well.  These are constructive comments, I love the vehicle and would buy another!

buick,enclave,2018,H Williams, 11/29/2017,Buick has raised the bar,5,"Purchased the 2018 Buick Enclave Avenir FWD after test driving the BMW X5 and Audi A7. Both the BMW and Audi are excellent vehicles but do not match the smooth quiet ride of the Avenir trim level of the Enclave. The interior gives the passengers an exceedingly quiet ride while moving effortlessly down the road. The sound system is just outstanding and the technology control panel is easy to learn and use. Passenger safety is enhanced with features that keep you at a safe distance from vehicles in front and blind spot awareness. Have not found a better value in this price range.

buick,enclave,2018,Jay, 12/04/2017,The Best One Yet!,5,"We've owned 2008 and 2012 Enclaves so we are familiar with the car.  Coming from a series of minivans we loved the look of the 2008 Enclave, and the 2018 is a great improvement on the original.  The Avenir is quieter, more luxurious, thriftier and more comfortable than the earlier versions.  I particularly like the switchable AWD which lets us run in FWD most of the time.  The technology is amazing:  we especially like the 'birds-eye-view' and the camera rear view mirror, though both took a bit of getting used to 'em.  A feature not available on any non-GM suv is the OnStar app which lets us remotely start the engine.  Arriving at the airport and being able to warm the car while waiting for our luggage is a real plus.  We looked at most of the 3-row suv's available and, for price, features, cosmetics, and overall quality, nothing bests the Avenir, IMHO!

Update:  Now that we have some miles on the car I can add some additional comments.  The car has remained trouble-free and enjoyable to drive, especially long distances.  We've got the  2018-9 Enclave-specific roof racks for our car top carrier...you cannot get a generic rack, btw.  My wife really like the automatic high beams but is less interested in the trick rear view mirror or the adaptive cruise control.  The automatic emergency braking works well and, as aging baby boomers we both like all the safety features.  I'll buy an (electric?) 2021 Enclave!

buick,enclave,2018,John Wright, 04/27/2018,A must test drive.....,5,"Each person has their own personality and style and so do vehicles. You must match your personality to the vehicle to truly love your car. So why do I rate the 2018 Buick Enclave Essence a must test drive? As a disabled Veteran who (let's face it) hurts everywhere all the time, I find the Buick Enclave to be the most comfortable and luxurious of the SUV's. The seats envelop you and hug you like the warm embrace of a mother to her child. No exaggeration. When I open the door either front or back (except third row) I can slide into my seat without having to contort my body just to get in. In the third row once you fold the middle seat up you can get right in and the back seats are just as comfortable and roomy. It drives like a luxury vehicle should with little to almost no road noise. My advice is to ask the dealer to take it with you when looking at other vehicles to compare. When you test drive one get back into the Buick and drive it again. You will see what I am talking about. One draw back.....seatbelts in middle seat tend to not let you lean forward to adjust middle climate controls when moving. Oh...Get middle captain seats.

buick,enclave,2018,Bob Janik, 06/30/2018,A couple minor things Buick missed,4,"We leased a the Buick Avenir about a month ago and there are a few things that Buick missed. 

1. Rain sensing wipers. On a 60K car, you’d think this would be available but it’s not even offered. 
I have them on my 2017 Dodge Durango Citadel
and it’s a great convenience.

2. Pre sets for driver power seats. Most cars have a button 1 and button 2 and the Enclave does. Issue is, you can’t just press the button like most cars, but you have to hold the button down until the seats gets to your programmed position. My wife is 5’-4” and I’m 6’-2” so it takes 15-20 seconds of me standing and holding the button until my seats go back to their pre set position

3. Driver seat is too narrow. I read a couple reviews that complained about it and I have to agree. If you’re over 200 pounds, it will be tight. "
buick,enclave,2018,Carl T., 04/01/2018,Screwed in Kutztown,1,"I had the 2013 Enclave.  It was everything as advertised.  I loved that car.  The shaft bearings went on it and I should have paid the $5k to fix it.  However, I thought why not just buy the new designed for 2018.  Big mistake.  I thought it was just an outside design.  However, they changed the design of the front seats (and I guess the back).  Made them smaller and you sit on the structural member of the outside bolsters. Structure pressure point creates pain in the legs and the Lumbar does not completely retract which causes back pain.  I can not drive this car for more than 15-20 minutes without having to get out.  I wanted to travel cross country with it.  Not now.  My better half complains about the passengers seat also.  I am presently trying to figure out where to position seating pads to prevent different back and leg pains.  DO NOT BUY THIS CAR if you are not young and narrowly skinny.  Pretty automobile but everytime I look at it I see pain.  Kinda like the first snow fall to the painful shoveling of the 10th.  However I am very pleased with our Dealership.  I traded in the 2018 Enclave ""even-up"" for a 2017 leftover XT5 Caddy.  Nice people.

The gauge reads over 1/8 of tank and digital reading over 65 miles till empty.  First time thought it was a fluke as it happened with less than 2000 miles. Today same thing again with 7000 miles.  Clearly a factory setting problem. Bigger issue is old behavior of transmission. Went into neutral going down the road. Would not engage several times into drive or reverse and required multiple attempts.

Car performance met my expectations. However after extended driving times the front seats are extremely uncomfortable. To the point that the circulation in the legs might be a problem. My wife experienced the same thing in the front passenger seat. The side bolsters in the front seats are narrowed to the point they hit you in the hip area and thighs. Due to the lack of concern or satisfaction from Buick or the dealer with a vehicle with 3,00 miles on it, I have had to purchase front seat cushions in order to use this vehicle. Goodbye GM.

buick,enclave,2018,Ted L, 02/10/2018,Horrible front seats-,2,"Beautiful car. Quiet. Many desirable features. Lots of storage room providing great utility. Drives nicely .Brakes are excellent. Reasonable ride .  However the front seats are VERY poor  being TOO narrow and a structural member in the side bolsters on each side catches one under the hips creating a uncomfortable pressure point. Seat backs are TOO narrow pressuring ones rib cage. I am 6""-3"" 225lbs. My 2014 Enclave has perfect front seats that are very comfy . How Buick engineers could put these poor quality seats in a large luxury SUV is very surprising  . Why Buick would completely redesign the seats to this new configuration ,when past seats were comfortable, is poor management  and development.   I am also disappointed in the lack of a CD player and the Start/Stop system ; but these are not deal breakers.  I am now looking at other makes of full size SUVs after owning three Enclaves since 2008 but may drive my 2014 Enclave another year . Again very disappointed in BUICK.

buick,enclave,2018,K. C., 08/27/2018,Buick Warranty is a joke!,2,"At 25,000 miles I'm missing paint in 4 places (2 identical areas on each side of the vehicle).  These are not stone chips, but actual worn sections.  We were told that due to the way we use the car, warranty won't cover this repair.  I drive to work and to my children's school, nothing out of the ordinary, except that we live on a dirt road.  We lived on this same dirt road while driving the previous 2 GMC Acadias that had NO PAINT ISSUES even at 90,000 miles.  We have a Chevy Cruze that costs half the amount of the Enclave and at the same amount of miles, it does not have any paint issues either.  On Day 4 of having the car, it would not accelerate over 15 mph.  I should have known then that this car was a waste of  money.

buick,enclave,2018,Pat K., 05/31/2018,AWD Premium is the best choice compared to XT5,4,"Originally went in for a test drive of the Cadillac XT5 and found the ride stiff and comfort was harsh for long distance drives - like a BMW 3 series / X1 feel.  Then next to it was an Enclave 1SN AWD which was great because it had most of the luxury features from the Cadillac in this great 3 row CUV and priced $10,000 less.  AWD is a must as I drive around curvy roads and snowy conditions. This may be my next vehicle!  Loved the easy entry/exit feature which helps get older / back injured folks in/out of the car with ease by lowering the seats and pulling them back each time you park the car and then remains that way when you get back in.  Seats would then raise and pull you forward to the steering wheel when you start the engine! Because this car is so similar to the XT5 without the price tag - it's a sure winner for a luxury CUV.

buick,enclave,2018,Rose70, 09/19/2018,Engine surge-scares me,4,"We purchased a 2018 Buick Enclave this spring.  We had a 2015 Chevy Silverado that we loved but my husband has back problems and it hurt him getting in and out of the truck climbing up.  Besides that we loved it.  We like the drive of the Buick and we never really used the air except to turn it on just to see how it  worked.  We should have tested it while we were sitting still.  When we are using the air and are stopped-the vehicle will surge and try to take off.  You better not let your foot off that brake for a second.  When the air shifts on it will surge.  I now you are to hold your foot on the brake but you need to really hold it down.  I asked the dealer he said its just the way it is set up. It cuts off to save fuel and when the air cuts on the engine comes on.  I still feel this is very dangerous.  Also there is not enough places to but your drinks and the dash does not even lock!  I never noticed that until we had purchased it.  Oh well about that but I will say the car does have a smooth ride.  Quiet.  It has a lot of power for a 6 cylinder.  The third row seat we put down for lots of storage.  Love the button unlock as long as you have the key on you for quick entry.  Love the auto hatch.  It's a really nice vehicle in many ways but it should be for what we paid for it.  But I'm still not happy about that surge problem.  If it had done that when we test drove it-I would not have purchased it.

Not only was the vehicle more money, but  we got less conviences. Hard to reach controls, or moving them farther away, and or not offering them in the package at all. It was our fault for thinking we would a least get as much as before, so we made the deal before actually seeing the vehicle. We are truly DISGUSTED with this vehicle. The new push button start and engine shutting off at every light is brutal. Shifter is bad. I also think  by bringing a more luxurious vehicle on ( ESSENCE MODEL ) is where all the good stuff is. The next time I spend  $ 50,000 , it. Will  not be a BUICK ENCLAVE. Actually went back to the dealer 4 days after purchasing ( Buick ) and told the dealer we wanted are ‘16 Buick back . They quoted us a large figure to get it back. ( it had low mileage ) . Offered to get back to us - but they never called. Went to other Buick dealers, but they said are vehicle was now only worth $ 30,000 . ( with 43 miles on it.) I offered $ 7000.00  to go up to 
the Avenir model, but they said no. We are stuck with a vehicle we hate - literately HATE it . A bunch of controls that are hard to use and get to. They added 4 “ to the vehicle and the windshield pillars block your view. When you search for the seat controls, they are hard to use. I am 78 years old & after owning 68 vehicles in my time, this is not my  “ FATHERS “ Buick. Anguish is all we think about when getting in this piece of  - @ #* %- junk.

Purchased the Enclave new and have currently made 2 trips back and forth to the mountains, each time filling the cargo area full.  While on the flatland from Illinois to Kentucky, kept it in FWD and upon hitting the mountains, put it into AWD and turn on towing mode.  This works great for keeping the brakes from over heating when going down an 8% mountain grade.  Last trip, which we just completed, averaged out to 27.5 MPG, for full trip.  High we achieved was 34.9 MPG, while basically coasting down the mountains with towing mode on.  Only issue currently, is I've noticed what seems to be transmission slippage between some of the gears.

buick,enclave,2018,Larry H, 08/28/2018,REALLY... no navigation!,4,"$50,000+. Nice ride, but come on, I am not paying OnStar monthly to provide navigation. Will use my phone. $35,000 Ford Fusion we traded in had navigation, adoptive speed control, memory seats/mirrors that adjusted with the tap of a button. Enclave Premier doesn't have navigation nor adoptive speed control. In order to get to your memory seat/mirror position, you have to press and hold the respective memory button while the seat and mirror go through their jerky motions and finally quit. If you let go too soon, that's where you stay. If you mention you have read this observation and want an explanation, be prepared for ""well that would seldom be necessary because the system recognizes your key fob and self adjusts"". That is usually true, but not always. AND be sure your spouse stays back away from the car in the rain or the system is just as likely to pick up on his/her fob setting. In summary, I have found Toyota and Nissan to be light years ahead of GM in electronics capability. And Ford is then in third place. GM, still using buggy whips for driver convenience.

buick,enclave,2018,Ron K, 10/18/2018,Disappointed,3,"Leased several Enclaves, new one every 2 years since they came out. The 2018 gets poor ratings. Front seats very uncomfortable, to narrow. At 14,000 miles the knuckle broke stranding me in traffic waiting for a tow truck. Dealer has to order new driveshaft from factory. Would not buy or lease another one.

buick,enclave,2018,Peter, 06/13/2018,Would not buy another buick,3,"Now after having the Enclave for a month, I've found some things that are very disappointing and somewhere I think I was misled and some because I didn't dig deep enough. First, no auto-sensing windshield wipers as rain on and off on a road trip and very annoying to have to turn them on and off. My Lincoln and Acura had these as standard which I would expect on a car costing over 60,000. On this recent trip I found it necessary to call Onstar with questions on some of the things I didn’t understand and found they were totally knowledgeable as multiple times they put me on hold or transferred me to advisers who had to go to the manual to answer my question. Now, the biggie and the reason I would never have bought this care is the Nav and Info system. They pride themselves on having blue tooth connection in the car and was told you could connect 10 devices. A call to Onstar took that down to 5 so another misleading statement. So whats the most important device I want connected to the blue tooth, my cell phone of course. Now I understand you can only use one device at a time, however, if you're cruising along at 75 mph on the highway and you are listening or using another device other than the phone and you get a call it will not be answer through the cars system meaning you have to physically answer the phone which is not only dangerous but against the law here in Ca. Must say I had a Lincoln MDX and an Acura MKX and both paused the device being used and the call transferred to the car. Buick has been most unhelpful here. Thus connecting 5 or 10 devices through Bluetooth on your car real is useless and switching between one or the other is extremely difficult. Their answer is, if your using a Kindle or Ipad is to hard connect it through the head phone connection in the car meaning that all that wireless connectivity that they advertise is a bit of BS meaning you now have to deal with a hard wire. Buicks answer to this is put all the info you might use on your cell phone. Yes I was told that to my by one of the Onstar adviser. Really! again meaning they admit the 10 devices I was originally told I could connect would be useless as moving from one to another is so difficult or impossible that is would be dangerous which is the whole reason for the wireless connection which is safety. As many might agree there is a lot in all the new car manuals that you must learn which is why Onstar is important but as I found Onstar advisers a bit useless as they are not not trained very well mean I might as well pull of the road and go to the manual. Bottom line safety is what I want in a car and the connection to my cell phone is the most important device which I believe should always be active. Not so with Buick again as noted above. Very disappointed as I decided to try again to support an American manufacturer."" After now having driven the car for 5 months I find it nice to drive and wife loves the seat heaters and ac seats so that's a nice benefit. Still disappointed with the items above but have gotten used to driving the car. However, the skylights which to open are manual and they snap open when you release them and when closed both of them make an annoying rattle so keep them open most of the time. Haven't been in for a service so will see what they can do about these rattles. All in all it's a nice car but some of the items such as auto-sensing windshield wipers should have been standard. Service people are knowledgeable as the wing mirrors as per the manual should fold back automatically as per he manual. My don't most of the time but do and 25% of the time because there is a problem yet they maintain that they are not supposed to fold back when the vehicle is shut down. Other than now after a few years it's become a rattle trap I should have known not to buy another American car but keep giving the doubt that our country can get back
 to the high standards we used to have. GM has certainly not convinced me that they are trying.

buick,enclave,2018,Todd Davidson, 02/13/2018,Review at 17402,5,"This Enclave ESSENCE is a beautiful SUV. It is a wonderfully quiet and smooth riding vehicle. It makes highway driving a true pleasure and around town it is equally as satisfying to drive.  However, the GM navigation system is erratic and they charge $150 + for periodic updates. That is ridiculous. I use Apple play and Google.

buick,enclave,2018,Patricia Pendorf, 03/08/2019,Transmission and moon roof,3,"I purchased my Enclave in July, 2018, fully loaded, black cherry color.  As advertised, this is a quiet and comfortable ride with one exception, the flimsy sun/moonroof slide is made of fabric with a manual pull.  It vibrates constantly causing a rattling noise.  I have put a stack of small papers wedged in there to stop it....very cheaply engineered at this price point.  Most importantly is the poor transmission performance. My transmission is leakind fluid and slips out of gear, the dealership cannot figure out the problem and suggested I keep driving it for now!!??  I will be trading in the Enclave this summer, no more Buicks for me!

buick,enclave,2018,amiller, 07/25/2019,So far so good—updated 1/29/20,4,"In May 2019 we bought a 2018 Enclave Premium front drive demo with 4700 miles on it and $10,000 off the MSRP. Our other cars are a 2017 Cadillac CT6 and a 2010 Suzuki Grand Vitara.  The dealer was Yates Buick/GMC in Goodyear, AZ, and I have no complaints with them — they do what dealers do (and they were only 2 miles away).  I researched the Enclave for several weeks before buying: watched all the video reviews; read the printed reviews; checked out the comparison reviews.  The new Kia Telluride was a consideration but they were new and hard to find.
After 5 weeks of driving the Enclave around locally and one 250 mile circle (including 35 miles of rough dirt road), we took a one month, 5700 mile round trip to Florida, picking up 2 grandkids and son and baggage. (Filled it to the brim but really could’ve used a Suburban.)  The Enclave ran well, averaged 26 mpg, accommodated all of us, WiFi took care of the kids, SiriusXM & a/c for the adults.  No mechanical  problems. reasonably comfortable, spacious, pretty quiet.  Now it’s over 11,000 miles, had its first oil change, tire rotation, safety inspection, and so far so good.

Things I don’t like:
- glovebox doesn’t lock.
- flimsy, fluttering, buzzing sunroof shade.
- should have all around view camera and a front-view camera (probably on Avenier model).
- could use a few more storage bins.  A cubby in the left dash and a drawer under the passenger seat and captains chairs.  Should be a bin in the rear of the console (GMC Acadia has that).
- cargo area cover needs to be removed when using third row seats.  There’s no specific area to stow it nor another place further back to install it and cover the rearmost cargo area.
- Should have the camera rear view mirror (Avenier has it) for a wider view.
- seats aren’t as comfortable as I hoped. Could be the a/c plumbing inside the cushions but they feel lumpy after several hours. Also, the lumbar support only moves in and out but not up and down.
- no rain detecting, auto windshield wipers
- pretty noisy with sunroof or windows open
- I’m 5’11” and the lift gate doesn’t open high enough, even when set for ‘full open’ vs ‘3/4 open’.
- I’ve had better sunshades from GM.  Need a 2 piece sunshade like the Cadillac DTS had.  Or maybe a little wider.
- can’t believe it doesn’t have cargo management system with sliding rails and bars like Cadillac and GMC.
- not a flat cargo floor with all seats down. Too much gap between middle row captains chairs.  Captains chairs slide fore and aft but not side to side.

Things I like:
- navigation (although twice it did try take us through some doubtful routes).
- the driver’s info screen.
- plenty of USB charging ports
- good headlights
- good a/c with vents in the ceiling for the back rows
- smooth ride, fairly quiet (my idea of ‘quiet’ is living room quiet, which I haven’t found yet — no road/tire noise, engine/trans noise, etc)
- good turning-radius for something this big
- the under console storage bin (other owners complain of the shifter but I like lower storage bin that the electronic shifter allows)
- the size (depth) of the under armrest, 2-level storage.  
- regular gas and good highway mpg (26-28), but so-so in town (16-18)
- good power from non-turbo V-6
- access to the third row seats

Jan2020 update:
I’m liking this Buick more with each passing month.  We took it on another run from AZ to NC (5500 mi).  28 mpg eastbound and 25 mpg westward on I-40.  At the Phoenix auto show, went through every manufacturer’s SUV and realized the Enclave is a good package.  (And I was looking for a reason to switch.  It’s not perfect, but at it’s price point I can’t find a reason to change.)
Likes: 
Good headlights.
Gas range between fill-ups.
Roominess.
Storage bins.
Push button start.
Shifter. (But it makes it hard to switch to another car because I forget to shift back to Park.)

Dislikes:
Seat comfort could be
 better — it’s like a pipe under my left buttuck and is the same in our CT6 seats.
Cheap sunroof cover flutters when windows open, buzzy.
Cargo area cover creaks and clicks.
Chrome strips on left side dash annoyingly reflect on side window and rear view mirror.

buick,enclave,2018,Evandenb, 08/06/2019,9 speed to the curb,3,"Bought this car new in 4/2018. 13,000 miles later I was parking and the car stopped, shifted into Neutral and parking brake came on. Tried everything to shift out of park to move out of the middle of the lot, but as soon as you got the car into neutral and released the parking break, both would re-engage. There is no way to manually over ride to push out of traffic and a special tool is required to physically move the shifter under the hood. Tow trucks came and dragged the car up the ramp because P break wouldn’t disengage. Car has been in shop for over a week and will likely require total tranny replacement. "
buick,enclave,2018,Kenneth , 09/11/2019,Lengthy Test Drive Before You Buy,4,"We purchased as a pre-owned Buick Avenir certified with 15k miles. This replaced our loaded out 2011 Enclave. In previous reviews it was pointed out how the front seats are narrower causing discomfort in my case on road trips one hour or longer as I'm the main driver. As stated the bolsters are the issue particularly the left side on drivers side. There's a rounded hard like piece under the leather running parallel with the bolster. Supposedly is part of the vibration mechanism when you enter lane departure. I'm a large man 5' 10"" at 300# therefore use every inch and then some of the seating surface. The little round piece I described begins to become very uncomfortable on long road trips. Now my wife doesn't have that issue with the seat as she is a small person.  She loves the comfort of her vehicle she drives everyday. All I can say if you're a large person you should test drive for a good long drive. You can feel this round thing by pressing on the outside bolster, it's just under the surface of the leather. She's had one hiccup with the camera system going dark for a day. I set up an appointment with the dealership the next morning. That next morning when she started up the camera system was working as designed. That issue hasn't happened since. The internal moonroof slide cover is cheaply designed and made. It sometimes has a tendency to rattle on bumpy roads. The latch is cheap. The other thing that makes me wonder about the engineering is when you fold the third row down via electrical switch located behind the third row is they hang up on the back of the second row Captain seats if they aren't pulled forward to clear to lay flat. One last marvel idea is the on off start when you stop to turn or stop go traffic. I know this design is to improve the overall average gas mileage that is mandated by EPA. This feature is being implemented more and more in the newer vehicles. You can't override this as an option in the vehicle settings. There is talk that an option may be available in the newer models to come. I've found the workaround is when you come to a stop and the engine turns off just slightly release and repress the brake pedal as it will restart continuing to idle. Now for the positive. The vehicle drives great, transmission shifts very smoothly and the engine has plenty of power to get you around someone or entering the highway. The cabin is very quiet and comfortable outside of the driver's seat as mentioned before. It's not perfect but for a 3rd row SUV with all the cargo space it's a great bang for your buck. "

buick,enclave,2018,Duckman, 03/14/2019,Enclave review,4,"Bought a 2018 Buick Enclave, while giving my 2015 to a friend. Like the 2015, the Enclave gives a great ride on the highway, it has improved video screen and climate controls. After owning 1/2 dozen SUV or AWD vehicles over the years, you can finally turn off the AWD. By going to two wheel drive your gas mileage improves from the high teens to the mid twenties, which is great for a vehicle that size. Mileage is BETTER than wife's Subaru , which is great from the days of Pathfinder or Acadia. Down side is; some reason Buick got to rid of the gas cap and only have a tab to push aside. If the gas hose is not fully inserted, gas will flow everywhere. Also, the new design has the ""flared up"" rear side windows, thus limited blinds spots is now increase.

I am very overweight at close to 300 lbs and I find no issue with comfort.  I owned the Mazda cx-9 and got rid of it after 8 months because it was so uncomfortable.  The headlights on the SUV are BRIGHT, to the point where if you're driving with your low beams on, cars comming the other direction will flash their high beams at you, but I can see on the dark, country roads I have to drive at night.

Loved everything about this one. Had A LOT of upgrades from my 2011. I have always liked the luxury feel of the Enclave. With each year they seemed to get better until the 2018. I traded my 2015 because of the milage and the 2018 seemed sleeker and more streamlined. I bought with my romance of the vehicle and should have looked it over a little more before pulling the trigger. They have taken the luxury out of this vehicle. From the interior to the exterior. After having it for the past couple months I have found the transmission to be clunky and jumpy. Especially sitting at a full stop to accelerating the vehicle can lurch and feel like something is not shifting right. I took it into the dealer and the put a computer upgrade into it, but it still does the same thing, so I will be taking it back. I believe Buick has missed the mark on this one. The interior is not as comfortable and has a more Toyota, Honda, and other foreign car sanitized feel to it (More cheaply made). If I were wanting to buy another one or if a friend I knew wanted one. I would tell them to stay away from a new one and look for a 2015 model with low mile. TEST drive this vehicle before buying!"
buick,enclave,2018,Carronade, 06/02/2019,Great car for long drives,5,"We live in Mississippi and commute to Virginia where we have an apartment, a trip of 850 miles.  We do this several times a year so a comfortable car is important.  We have made the trip in two different Limited Highlanders, one a platinum, and a Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit.  This Enclave Avenir beats them all.  The long wheelbase helps it track well on the interstate and the 20-inch wheels absorb the bumps when you detour on two-lane roads.  The front seats are fantastic and our friends rave about the back seats.  There is more room than we ever need behind the seats, so it packs well.  The car is quiet and the engine is smooth.  The adaptive cruise control will take you to a dead stop and start you back up with the push of a button or a touch of the accelerator.  The navigation and entertainment are great, but we use Apple Car Play with Waze and Pandora most of the time.  The high-definition Pandora music sounds great on the sound system.  I use the hands-free functions for calls and texts, so I never have to touch my phone which rides along with the screen off.  Visibility is good and the controls are easy to use.  Consumer Reports does not like the shifter.  It is different, but only took me about three days to get accustomed to it.  I do not understand their complaint.  The only thing that I would add to it is rain sensing wipers.  My last two vehicles had them and I was spoiled to them.  However this remains the best road car that I have ever owned.

UPDATE: We have had this vehicle for almost three years and I would not change a word of this review.  It remains the best vehicle that we have ever owned.  I typically trade ever year or two, but will probably keep this Enclave until the tires dry rot.

This was around New Years, we went back to get the Enclave and the dealer said they were later told by GM just to flush the transmission as it had too much lubricant from assembly.  We took it home and it still shuddered, called the dealer and GM said to flush it again.  This time when we picked it up it was worse than when it started.  So now GM told the dealership to replace the torque converter however they cannot locate one.   So now 6 weeks after this started we are still waiting for a torque converter that may or may not fix this.

The new transmission is clunky and does not shift smoothly on hills going both up and down. I strongly recommend avoiding Buick's with this transmission!

I bought a 2019 Enclave in October 2019.  Immediately experienced transmission surging while driving down my moderately sloping driveway.  Then on Dec 20,2018 I could not go over 27 mph nor shift gears.  Towed by dealer to their shop and told they had to order a new transmission from N. Dakota if available. Which leads me to suspect that new transmissions must be in demand due to being a chronic problem. Web searching indicates 2018's had same problem and the 2019's have the same model number transmission as the 2018's.  Hope to not have to go the Lemon Law route.  Dealer has been very good.

Porter, 04/01/2019,Impressed,4,"Didn't want to purchase a GM product, but since the Enclave is the only CUV with three usable rows of seating which still has decent cargo space behind the third row, I took a chance.  So far I've been impressed.  The ride and handling are very good, the engine has plenty of power, the transmission is less smooth than I expected but it's okay, the tech features are useful, there are many safety features, and the fit and finish are good.  No problems with anything so far.  It's not perfect of course.  Some of the materials are not luxury level, the electronic gear shifter is awkward, and there are a few missing amenities, but overall it's been enjoyable.

Update:  It's been over a year now with the Enclave and everything is still great.  No issues whatsoever.

buick,enclave,2019,Shannon W., 06/03/2019,BEST VEHICLE I HAVE EVER OWNED!,5,"Update: 12/5/2020 - I have had my Enclave for almost 2 years.  It has 30k miles on it and I still love it just as much as the day I got it!  It has been a great vehicle.  Had to have two of the electronic components repaired, but both completely covered under warranty.  The transmission and drive train have worked flawlessly!  The vehicle rides so smoothly and is so quiet!  Still very happy with my purchase.

This vehicle is such a pleasant surprise!  Did extensive research as I was transitioning from 13 years in a mini-van.  Was looking for a mid-size SUV with all of the bells and whistles, but could also fit my family of 5, which includes 3 teenagers, plus my 80lb Lab.  I drove the Toyota Highlander, Volvo XC90, Subaru Ascent, Ford Explorer, GMC Acadia and Honda Pilot and I knew as soon as I drove this it was the car for me.  It was the last car I drove because I was trying to stay away from GM, but I tell you what!  GM has really upped their game with this vehicle.  It is a Luxury vehicle at a reasonable price and pretty good warranty (4yrs/50k).  Do yourselves a favor and go drive one! I have put 5k miles on it in 3 months.  It rides so smoothly and quiet!  Don’t love the shifter and the manual shades for the sun roof, and the door storage is kind of useless, but those are minor in the grand sceme of things and definitely not dealbreakers.  Everything else makes up for it!  I love this SUV!

It gives a lot for its price compared to competitors. Before getting 2010 enclave we had BMW X5. We sold x5 at 135000 miles. To be honest X5 cost way more in maintenance above 120000 miles than enclave. We liked enclave better

buick,enclave,2019,Kari C, 04/11/2019,2019 Buick Enclave - What a Joke,1,"Purchased a new 2019 Enclave in November of 2018. After driving my car 100 miles it broke down due to transmission issues. I was told by the dealership that it needed new Transmission sleeves & that the parts would need to be ordered (this whole ordeal took nearly 3 weeks) now 3 months later - the same thing has happened. Wouldn’t go over 5 miles an hr. Shuddered and felt like it was missing gears. I had to towed to the dealership & now I am being told that the car just needed an update - something is starting to fee not right with all of the information I’m being told. 
I loved this car when i purchased it & now I hate it. 
DO NOT BUY THIS CAR........
"
buick,enclave,2019,Ann, 12/25/2018,Lemon for Christmas,1,"I bought a brand new 2019 Enclave Avenir on December 12, 2018. I loved everything about it except for noticing some of the electronic features were not working correctly which I had planned on taking back to the dealership for them to check out the first chance I got. On Saturday, December 22, 2018, I had stopped at a train crossing and had put the shift into park waiting for the train to pass. After the train had passed I then put the shift into Drive being very particular with my new car always looking to make sure on the panel that the D showed up which it did.  I then proceeded to cross the track when the car abruptly stalled on the tracks and would not budge with the motor still running. When the car stalled it made a loud grinding noise and the vehicle started jerking hard sending us forward in our seats. I even screamed not knowing what had happened all the while pressing on the accelerator trying to make the car accelerate. It was terrifying being stuck on the railroad tracks because on this particular track several trains pass on it. Another person was with me in the passenger seat and my small son in the seat behind me. This lasted for approximately one or two minutes when we knew our only choice was to get out of the vehicle because of fear of another train soon coming. I then tried one last time pressing the accelerator with this time the car finally moving. I was shaking so bad still in shock from what had happened in fear it was going to happen again before reaching my home. Luckily my home was only about two miles from there. As soon as I parked it in my garage I called the dealership to be told that they would pick it up on Monday, December 24th. They sent a tow truck to pick it up and left me with a much less expensive vehicle to drive which when I purchased the vehicle I was told I would be furnished with a car of equal value if the car was ever in the shop. Well, with a little over 900 miles on my nice expensive new vehicle I watched it being towed away on Christmas Eve which was supposed to have been an early Christmas gift for me and my family. So needless to say I am very unhappy with my new Enclave and the dealership I purchased it from. I do not want this vehicle back after the danger it put me and my passengers in. We had just got off the interstate a few minutes before this happened so what if it had stalled on the interstate with the fast-moving traffic the story would have had a totally different outcome. I do not know yet what will be done about the situation since the car has not yet been checked out but I know that I purchased a LEMON. A stressful Christmas but so thankful God took care of us because we could have not been here to even celebrate this special day.

buick,enclave,2019,Steve Downey, 08/01/2019,Smooth ride and great handling.,5,"The best things about the new Enclave are outside and especially the interior styling. The interior is not cluttered and the fit and trim is great. the Transmission is smooth and all negative about the reverse on the stick it silly. It takes one time putting in reverse and you have mastered it. Super quiet on the road. Infotainment is the best. Essence has most what you need if you don't want to spend on every bell and whistle. Yes there are a few little short cummings like no light in the glove box. But the pluses out weight nit picking some small things as a lot of reviews seem to do. The LED head lamps are great and boy I can finally see at night. The V6 give you plenty of power i don't need to go from 0 to 60 in 4 seconds.  I was most surprised by the drive and handling. It really hides the bumps and rocks that I was use to feeling in another  2017 Buick I had. You must check the Enclave. I think you will be surprised and roomy is what I need at 6'4.

buick,enclave,2019,Carol W, 01/16/2020,Disappointed in the seats and several other things,3,"My 2019 Enclave is my 3rd one.  Now wishing I had kept my 2015 Enclave a bit longer.  The seats in the 20154 and my 2008 were extremely comfortable. Now they have changed the seats so they are way to hard!  Very uncomfortable for me.  And I'm told nothing to be done about it.  Update: After a year and 17,000 miles, the seats are still hard and uncomfortable.
I can no longer charge my cell phone if the engine is shut off.  Was able to in my 2008 and 2014. That was a great feature when we lost house power due to a storm. 
The left third row seat is very difficult to pull back up once it was put down to afford more cargo space. 
Sorry GM, you are ruining what was once a really nice car.
UPDATE 7/29/20
Just returned from a 2500 mile round trip and found the seats on a long drive are even worse than I thought as they caused me substantial back pain.  Unless you like hard seats, I do not recommend this car!

buick,enclave,2019,Steve Jones, 01/22/2020,Transmission Whine,1,"I took delivery of my 2019 Enclavein Nov 2019 and like it a lot.  However, it developed a transmission whine shortly after delivery.  I took it to my dealer and the service manager went for a ride with me.  He acknowledged the noise and said he heard it in other Buicks.  I wondered if it might be the torque converter and he mentioned another possibility that I can not remember.  He told me he would contact the GM rep and get back in touch.  A few days later I received a call telling me that the noise is considered acceptable as other cars with this transmission also make this noise...  That is ridiculous.  No new car should make transmission noise, especially a Buick which is classified as a luxury SUV and is the reason I purchased it. 

I contacted the dealership owner who said he would look into it and get back with me.  Haven't heard from him yet.  It looks like the run around has begun.

I tour clients as part of my job and several without prompting have said WOW this is a very nice, quiet vehicle. When I have told them is a Buick they have said,Really? Well they got it right! The amenities hold their own with other higher priced vehicles. I traded a mercedes suv and although the mercedes might have had a few more creature comforts and softer plastic finishes the Buick is proving more reliable and a more comfortable experience. There is always someone who can be negative but my experience with the 2019 Buick Enclave has exceeded my expectations.

If this is any inclination of what I have to look forward to, the future's not looking too bright. I was a complete idiot for trading my Denali.

buick,enclave,2019,JasonW, 03/03/2020,Avenir not worth the extra price tag,3,"We bought the Avenir for some of the luxury and convenience features. Most of them we have since disabled because they either created a very intrusive (and unsafe) driving experience or were awkward to use. 
The ""hands free"" lift gate at the back works only sporadically - it is much faster to just open it with the button - so this feature doesn't get much use either. 
One of the most disappointing things has been cheap material covering the sun roof. This fastens loosely resulting in a lot of rattling and road noise. So we drive around in our expensive ""luxury"" car with a tissue stuffed up under the sun roof to prevent it from rattling. 
Overall, I like the car - but would never recommend stepping up to the Avenir trim. It is just not worth the extra money. And avoid the sun roof - it just feels cheap and it's noisy.

I lucked into getting this car for a 7-day rental period, and was incredibly impressed. Over the course of the week I put on approximately 1100 miles and found the new Enclave to be fantastic in terms of comfort, gas mileage (avg 25mpg in mixed driving), and performance. Additionally, I have a fair bit of experience with a 2012 Enclave that my mother had previously owned. Without question, the 2019 blows the older model away in every aspect.

I never know when this thing will go into gear or not. Which gear it will go into. An auto stick with 4 movement directions and 2 or 3 buttons??? 10yr old must have designed this.
Dash controls just as useless. No manual button for AC control on dash. Fan speed has push buttons instead of a dial.
If you use screen for adjustments you can't adjust music and ventilation at same time. 
Volume control is unpredictable and largely uncontrollable. 
MODE buttons are too close together in touch screen. Half the time I get the wrong mode. A huge distraction from DRIVING. 
And 2 of the modes we hardly ever use anyway. Shouldn't even be in the mix.
Air vents can't be adjusted for tall people. I can't get steering wheel into a comfortable position for long trips and requires use of pillows on both arm rests to be comfortable.

 Just got back from a 10 day 10 state trip driving through torrential rain (tropical storm Andrea) and the only complaints I have is the Bluetooth wouldn't always connect with my phone and sometimes the GPS wouldn't work.
It was a little bit hard to pass other cars in the mountains of Pennsylvania but every other part of the trip the driving was great!
 We averaged 33 mpg.
 Plenty of room for 2 people and with the back seats folded down there was plenty of cargo space.

Update.  I am at just over 60,000 miles and I am still happy with my Encore.  I am considering trading it in, only because of the amount of miles I have on it.    The only problem I have had with the car was this past winter the heat didn't work.

Going up hills, and going into headwinds puts a definite strain on this little engine. And the more it strains the less MPG it gets.

I also am concerned with the air intake design beings this car stalled out on me while driving one crappy winter day in ND. This is not a good situation for a new car to have happen to it and the passengers. Snow/moisture should not get into parts of the engine compartment where it can cause problems."

After a recent trip of 2850 miles in 10 days through highways, interstates, and the back roads and mountain roads of West Virginia, I am very satisfied.
From Indiana to Florida and back, the car averaged 33.2 miles per gallon running the air conditioning all of the time.
I was originally concerned that it might lack power in the mountains but I was pleasantly surprised.
I was able to pass on hills and the Encore was responsive to quick acceleration.
The car was very comfortable.
The convex blind spot mirrors take some time to get used to but I am very pleased with the vehicle.
As an Encore to the Encore, I have been so pleased with the performance of the Encore that we purchased another Encore, a 2015 Encore convenience package with  AWD in May of 2015.  The upgrade list of features for safety have been great with blind spot warning side view mirrors and back up alert with cross traffic warning.

Still a great car.  No mechanical issues experienced with just routing oil changes and tire rotations.  Great car for empty nesters or those with smaller children.  Plenty of room and would purchase again.
March 2020:  The only mechanical issues I have had is with there is a coolant line that has leaked at the turbo.  This has occurred twice, the first time was within warranty and the second time we had to pay.  Also had a water pump go out.  Somewhat disappointing since the car has only 37K on it at this time.

During the test drive, I could get it to merge on the highway without any problems--of course, I did not expect it to glide (say the way an Infinity does). I bought it because of its fuel economy, but it is still fun to drive. It took no time to connect my blue-tooth phone and have music come out beautifully from the Bose speakers. Don't let all the knobs discourage you--the system is actually easy to use! Having moved from an Acura TSX, I like the slightly higher ride while still having a compact size. "

buick,encore,2013,Tarae3173, 05/17/2018,Would not recommend buying a Buick Encore,2,"I bought a brand new 2013 Buick Encore and never had any major problems with it until recently. It now has 78,000 miles on it. Last week my engine light turned on and shortly after that a repetitive almost clicking noise came from the engine when it was running and it would have issues accelerating and decelerating. The engine light would also come one and off and the noise would decrease a bit when it was off. I called my dealership and made an appointment. I was told my lifters needed to be replaced and also that I had a crack in my front exhaust. My dealership said for how old my car is this should not have happened. I also take in my car regularly for maintenance check and oil changes. My change oil light has never even come on. I had my dealership do the repairs and $1,000 later my car seems to be working properly again. I called Buick and opened a case to see if there was anything they could do. I was also told by them that the lifters should not have gone out. I received follow up today and was informed there is nothing that can be done. The powertran warranty is what covers that and since it only goes until 70,000 there is nothing that can be done and they cannot extend the warranty. I asked if my car only had 72,000 miles on it if that would have made a difference and they said yes. So basically because my lifters decided to crap out for no reason at 78,000 and that's not close enough to 70,000 I am stuck with those repair costs. I will never be buying a Buick again. I don't know a lot about cars but I do know that I had a used Oldsmobile Alero for 10 years that I took way less care of and never had a single engine issue.  I would not recommend buying this car and I have read a lot of other people's issues with Encores and problems that should not occur and having to pay a lot of money out of pocket for them.

I highly recommend the Encore for empty nesters or someone who has no more than 2 children.  I have found the Encore to perform well in all situations we have encountered.  It handles the mountains of West Virginia, the heat and humidity of Florida and the narrow winding roads of Pennsylvania.  The high ground clearance makes it especially good for driving in snow.  (The only non-standard repair was a leak in a coolant hose at the turbo which was covered by warranty and was completed in a day.) (UPDATE:  the same coolant leak developed at the turbo and was not covered by warranty.  2X for same issue and vehicle has only 38K causes me to wonder if this is an inherent issue that might justify GM looking into a recall)
I would, and did buy Encore again. (2015 Convenience AWD)

(too many buttons and gadgets to learn) Navigation system not user friendly.  No touch screen.   The 2013 Premium does not come with blind spot monitoring as seen on many sites.  It has a small mirror located on the mirror that is the blind spot monitoring.  Lane detection works very well.

My wife will be driving it and she loves the size and design. Great mpg, very quiet and fun to drive.
Looks small on the outside but seems big on the inside.
Engine is not overpowering but very peppy.

buick,encore,2013,spitzlab, 04/11/2013,Loving my little SUV,5,I've had my Encore for about 2 weeks and have begun to have fun driving again. It's very manuverable in traffic and i can zip down the hwy if i want to. I think it looks stylish and not like the rest of the pack. While it's small I had no problem getting into it and I'm a very large person. I have arthritis and some of those higher vehicles just didn't work for me. Also My 77y/o mom can get in and out of this very easy too. I'm getting 24 MPG on my first 300 miles and it's the AWD model and it's city driving. It's had all the features that i was hoping for and more. And i could afford it. Since most adults now spend more time single than married this is the perfect vehicle for a single too!

This review is my first impressions. 

So far, I hate one and only thing: bling. All Leather Group Encores that were available right now had chrome wheels and you can't change it. This is an addition of $1,000 to the total car price that was forced down my throat by some schlub on Buick's payroll who decided that's what the first batch of Leather Group Encores should have. There are other decorative, non functional ""design"" elements that I am learning to tolerate.
Fake plastic hood vents are not cool, despite what the hoodlums are saying."

buick,encore,2013,neilman, 02/03/2013,Disappointed with Buick Encore,3,"Vehicle road tested wonderful during the dealer visit, but has been a huge disappointment after taking it home. We already exchanged the vehicle (so we're on our second one) and really appreciate the dealership's cooperation with doing their best to make the situation right for us. Both vehicles have the same problem, in fact the 2nd one is worse and I wish I had kept the 1st one. 
 
While entering and exiting our driveway (with the steering turned left or right) which has a normal drainage dip (water canal) between the road and driveway elevation, there are thumping noises coming from the suspension. Of course as is typical...the problem could not be duplicated at the dealership. 
 
I have driven many many cars on my driveway and never heard this type of noise from any other car. I owned 4 GM cars over a 20 year period through 2009, and finally gave up due to the consistent need to pour money into repairs after about 4 - 5 years of ownership. 
 
I thought things may have improved and gave it another shot, but I guess I was dead wrong. I feel terribly let down and like I made a huge mistake. The classic definition of 'insanity' is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. I must be insane for falling for the same mistake over and over. "

Then the reduce engine speed system was active, in traffic, could not go more that 2 miles an hour, very dangerous and scary. Next 4 major engine oil leaks, repairs on those 1200.00. Now I have to pay for repairs on a cracked turbocharger, 2000.00. I bought a Buick because they are supposed to be safe and reliable.

We have been told that it is on back order and they do not know how long it will take to get the part.  We can not drive it either because that could ruin the entire engine.  We called GM and got a claim number and they gave us a case worker who is never in and the message says they will return your call and they never due.

Worst GPS routing I have ever used.  Hard to use as it is voice only and some names not recognized, also GM wants $140 to update map every year.  Our TOM TOM comes with free lifetime map updates for less than one GM update -- and it is easier to use.

buick,encore,2014,suydam, 04/14/2015,Love this car! : 2 year update,5,"2Year Update:  This car has become a much loved vehicle. It's the Swiss Army knife of small SUVs. It does everything we want it to do.  My husband drove it across the country last summer with our dog. It has been a great road trip car. Quiet and smooth. It also feels very lux inside.  It holds way more than its small size indicates. For example, So we have hauled ( at different times) a power washer, a 55"" TV, and 3 large dogs. It's very easy to fold both back and passenger seats. I would like it to get better mpg, but that's my only quibble. We have had no problems of any kind. I understand the new ones have push button start and improved rear camera with guidelines which improves an already great vehicle. I'd buy it again. 

I bought this car 2 months ago and we are both liking it more and more every day.   I love a small car that's quiet and it has a high quality interior.  Reviews about its lack of power are misleading. It has plenty of pep with the turbo and it actually gets better gas mileage than I thought it would. A joy to park in small spaces and I like the high seating position.  For a small vehicle it feels quite roomy inside.  It also handles well. 

We ar e empty nesters with 2 dogs and this is the perfect second vehicle for us.

I rifled off the highway here north of Cincinnati and drove head on into a guard rail.

Here is what I felt after driving over 1400 miles.

1. Very comfy riding experience, also thx to the noise reduction technology. Stylish exterior and cute design good for 20s 30s female driver.

For a 4 cylinder, acceleration was okay except for a slight lag.  Handling is nimble with good steering response.  Visibility is a problem out the back, especially with back seat passengers so learn to use the camera and side mirrors.  Plenty of controls for the driver seat position, even lumbar support, but the seat was feeling a little hard after only an hour of highway driving.  The main screen is bright and clear with intuitive controls.  Only the driver gets an arm rest.  It's odd, but there are only three vent configurations: foot, dash, and windshield.  The interior has a refined appearance with a leather wrapped steering wheel and soft-touch dash.  An auxiliary jack and USB are easily accessible.  Plenty of storage bins and cubbies.  The back seat has no air vents, but it does have pull-down drink holders.  First impression: a nimble, fun-to-drive SUV that is unexpectedly roomy.

I am not one to like SUV's but needed something with AWD.  This car sits up high like an SUV but drives like a small car. It does great in the rain and snow on curvy back roads. Gas mileage is great (average 26 mpg). As stated in many reviews, it is not a powerful car but it has the guts to get up on the highway at full speed. It has every comfort available and the safety features of a much more expensive vehicle.  This is the best new car I have ever owned."

1) The entertainment system has locked up many times.  The screen will not change, and I cannot control anything (change channels, volume, etc).  It will restart on it's own after driving for about 5 minutes.
2) The tire pressure monitoring system was reversed.  The pressure of the front right tire was actually the pressure of the rear right tire and vice versa.  Same thing on the left side.
3) When I used Bluetooth voice command to call a number of someone not already in my phone, it reversed the 2nd and 3rd digits.  (i.e. call ""928-xxx-xxxx"" and it would call ""982-xxx-xxxx"".
4) The blind spot alerts have stopped working on multiple occasions.  I read this sometimes happens with snow or rain, but it was not inclement weather when this happened to me.
5) The AC fan started making a squeaking sound.  I was able to get this replaced prior to it going out of warranty.

Other than this, the car is ok, it just has very little power.

buick,encore,2014,Daniel Clark, 07/18/2017,Give it an Encore for getting in and out!,5,"My first experience was getting in and out of my Encore. What a treat that was! I am used to driving in a 2005 Chevy Cavalier. I always had to clime off of the floor of that car. I deliver pizza's for Domino's Pizza, and I can deliver up to 30 deliveries in an 8 hour day. That's a total of 60 times I had to crawl out of that car, and hit my head on the roof  getting in, and out of that car. But enough of the Cavalier. Now I finally found my ''Dream Vehicle'' for delivering. Easy in and out. I just step in, and out with no effort at all. I am impressed. Just Imagine having to just step out of the car now. My knees, and back are thanking me to the hilt! Other wise it is a Quiet and comfortable car to drive. The handling is perfect. I need to make sudden U-Turns in my job, and this car can do them on the dime. Did I mention Quiet? Wow! It's Buick Quiet all right. I stopped at a traffic light to make a left turn the other day, and a car stopped next to me in the right lane. Business as usual right? Well I turned to look out my passenger window, and I saw the lady next to me get out of her car, and go to the rear or her car. She was mad all heck about something. Then I realized another car had hit her from behind. The other car behind her was smashed into  her car. To think I didn't even hear a thing. Now that's what I call Buick Quiet! Any way, I love my Buick Encore. And I recommend it for all the people that need head room, leg room, easy in and out, and a car with all the fetchers you would ever want for comfort, and safety.

The only cons that I have about it are, as mentioned in other reviews, it doesn't have the pep you'd expect with turbo; I find that braking isn't as good as I thought it should be; and rear view visibility is impaired by the back seat headrests.   

I love SUVs and have previously owned several Subaru SUVs and the Buick is a class above them in that it handles better, is sooo comfortable for my long commute, and looks great!

buick,encore,2014,Mike Stager, 01/31/2019,Buick built a fancy Go Cart,5,"What I mean is, while it's not the quickest to accelerate, our AWD Encore Premium gets out of its own way well enough.  Active stability, ABS and AWD make it a hoot to drive in the snow.  I haven't had a situation where it didn't just get going .  Around corners in town, I can encourage a little bit of slide, but it corrects it immediately and brings the car to a solid heading.  I can't say enough for its winter performance.  Heated seats are HOT at the highest level and don't take long to get there and you can easily find a setting to turn it down to for long term driving comfort.   Ours has a heated steering wheel as well, and as my wife said shortly after driving it ""every car we buy from here on out is going to get expensive.."" as in, heated steering wheel is no longer an option.  It's like thumb warmers on a snowmobile. There are 4 zones that heat up, so you can find a good spot to heat your hands and maintain control, as well as off the zones to take a break.  No adjustment on the level of heat though, would have liked to have that.  Newer models have a touch screen infotainment center, but after a couple of days getting used to the large button layout and center control knob, setting up the radio as well as the personalizations this car has to offer was pretty easy to figure out, and fun to play with. Cargo space with the seats up is limited with the seats up, but it's tidy and tight and gives you plenty of room to do a weeks worth of grocery shopping for 2.  I like that the Cargo cover stores in the vehicle just by sliding it up and down behind the back seat....great engineering Buick!  Overall what put me on buying the Encore was the fuel mileage ( averaging 27 in the winter and fill ups are only 11.5 Gallons! ) and we are averaging 250 mil plus per tank.  Currently the weather has been -35F with highs of -10 and it starts right up and takes very little time for the engine to warm up and get to heating the interior.  The raw cost of replacement parts for the Encore are reasonably priced, particularly due to the fact that the Encore chassis is shared with 4 other models around the world...that helps keep the cost down.  I did a lot of research before settling on this car, and owner reviews have been overwhelmingly positive for comfort and owner satisfaction.  Long distance driving was a noted plus, which for us was important due to the desire to begin doing more out of state driving.  The only real negatives I can give about this car is the lack luster performance of the motor and the buzzing noise you get out of small displacement 4 cylinder motors as they rev up.  Buick does a pretty good job of insulating you from most of the noise, but the motor isn't going to inspire anyone with a penchant for performance or exhaust note, but it does sip fuel decently for an AWD potato.  One other complaint would be rear visibility..the C pillars are pretty big, and the back window small.  The rearview mirror is also small, but it gives a clear view of what you can see behind you.  The side mirrors work well for viewing behind the left and right sides though, so if you are used to using your mirrors as they are intended, the rear C pillars become less of an annoyance.  They all come with a rear parking camera anyway, so use it and the side mirrors and you'll do fine.  I worried that the short wheel base might be a problem for stability as I found I wasn't a fan of 2 door Jeep wranglers when I had driven one, but it really doesn't affect the handling of the car at all.  It's very nimble, the AWD system doesn't seem to impair the ability to maneuver tight radius turns either.  I'm really trying to discuss negatives I've found with the car, but in reality, I'm really having to think hard of things I don't like about the car.  If you can accept the size and understand the limitations that come with that and that 30+ mpg out of an AWD
 SUV (CUV)  usually means sacrificing the power of a V6 or large displacement 4 cylinder, then you'll find yourself falling in love with the Encore.   One last thing. I'm shy of 6 ft tall and 240lbs.  My wife is short ( 5'5"") and our driving positions are fairly close in this thing.  If she drives my Bonneville and I get in afterwards, I have to move the seat before I can get it because it's so tight.  The upright seating position in the Encore makes it so that I have very little to adjust when I drive it vs. my wife.  We haven't even set up the memory seat positions we were adamant on getting when we were looking, so for you couples out there looking that are body size challenged between the two of you, you may find the Encore to be a really good fit.

buick,encore,2014,RS, 10/24/2016,Was in love with my little AWD encore until......,2,"I have enjoyed owning and driving this car overall.  The visibility is not that great, but it does have a back up camera and blind spot detection so that helps.  For a very small car with a 1.4L engine it is pretty zippy from a stop so that is nice.  Never felt like it bogged down like some of these cars can.  I have put about 30,000 miles on the car since owning it and have had regular maintenance done ( great systems for reminders built in to car).  One day last week my engine went out in rush hour traffic.  No warning, no lights, no nothing.  It was working one minute and then the next just unable to excelerate and TONS of white smoke.  Luckily I was able to pull off as I was in the outer lane and could coast.  AAA picked me up and took us to the dealer for repair.  Still under warranty so no problem there and everyone was nice, helpful and got me in a rental and on my way quickly.  About 3 days later they called me with the news that there is a factory defect in the 3rd piston that caused it to break unexpectedly.  They are currently replacing all 4 pistons and SAID that they checked all other parts in the engine and everything else looks fine......I am not convinced as that amount of smoke had to cause some type of damage to the rest of the engine.  I won't get my car back for several more days,  but now I am terrified to drive it and afraid that they will just draw it out until the warranty runs out.  I am not basing this on anything  but fear as they have been great so far.  Mine is a 2014 model - not basic but also not fully loaded.  One of the cutest cars on the road in this class, but now I am afraid of it.  Ugh.

Update:  I no longer own this car.  I went through some post tramatic stress after it almost got me killed by dying on the freeway when the pistons blew on the engine.  It was a manufacturing defect and they replaced the pistons but not the engine so, I traded it in on a different car.  Hopefully it's next owner has better luck with it.

I haven’t replaced it and may not since I have free access to handicapped transportation.

I noticed a coolant leak which I was told was in the turbo. No mechanic could find the leak. Around month 10, all of a sudden my car started shaking when I braked, high pitch screech from engine, constant check engine light, started to stall when I accelerated. This car only has 40,000 miles on it. Everything about the car was great, until it wasn’t.

Performance is mediocre. Driving it is a nightmare: I experience automatic transmission issues at times. Gears are switching erratically and incorrectly, the car is shaking. Dealer is reluctant to do anything: they just cannot duplicate the problem. Build quality is horrible: I did have a problem with shock absorber, it took me 4 visits to dealer to fix it.

Now I have had my eye on these encores for a while so I test drove one, it was really nice. Pearl white, roof rack, top tier of the selections and 40,000 miles. I did my research before pulling the trigger, How wrong I was, I am glade I bought the 100,00 0 mile warranty. Took it 6 miles from dealer ship to my friends, parked it, showed it off and then went to leave.....it turned on with the check engine light and then just stopped working. After getting it towed by the dealership and having them look at it they told me it was emc and it could be replaced and it would be good to go. (Laughing) yea got it from the Buick service and made it to their sign when,it died,again. Same thing emc and about 4 pages of error codes later, I returned to the dealership with keys in hand.

to buy a vehicle with
some luxury touches, a higher seating position and a quiet interior.
I kept looking at the Encore and being put off by reviews saying that the engine is too small, itÂs slow etc. But when I actually test drove an Encore Leather, I was hooked.
No problems merging on to the highway or driving on hills. The turbocharged engine managed just fine.
Have driven
it
for 3 mths mostly in town with a few trips on the highway, and one
in Rocky Mountain Nat. Pk.
There, the car purred quietly up and down the snowy and sometimes slippery mountain roads and I could easily control the downhill speed in the Manual range."

The once upon a time in disclosing that the car ""used to belong"" is just about the best way to turn around and leave any dealership.  I have owned my car for 11 month and in the beginning it was just want I wanted. although the price in paying off the mother in laws issues is not worth it, I felt I could afford the thing which has turned in the creature from the black lagoon. I have had it towed to two different Buick dealerships 6 times and i just waiting for the 7th the pop up any day now.  The service departments have replaced the batteries 4 times and one was a call back and I don't even remember what the other issue was.  None-the-less the surgical attempts failed and I am stuck with the grayest lemon in the city of Massillon, Ohio.  I have reviewed several other reviews from individuals who shared having the same problem and the results were the same unresolved by Mr. GM  and the dealership.  At one point, there was contact with the dealership  that was made but being told to take it somewhere that services Buick was fine, but no offers of support were ever issued. You know you have a semi-lemon (semi because it will work on occasion) When a opening statement of regret starts as ""Well."" Alright you have been had kiddo, lights out, party's' over, pig's on the griddle and you have been cooked.  Why is there not a legitimate complaint division for cars? and true  justice for a lemon. Yes I do I understand the lemon law but who's to listen.  Such unrequited trust in what we count as justice, until those who we count on to deliver justice is wearing our size 9.5's.  If I don't express my feeling I would probably break and drive it right down GM's you know what.

It is now February 2020 and I have had to replace 3 valve cover gaskets and each repair is upwards of $300.00.  There must be a defect in the engineering and its very frustrating.

buick,encore,2014,Krista, 11/04/2018,Bad Buick,2,"I’ve owned over a dozen Buick/Oldsmobiles over the years and this is the absolute worst Buick I have ever owned. I bought it in 2017 with 36,000 miles on it and have taken it to the shop for several issues (thankfully under warranty). It’s had to have a new battery, the AWD had to have a software download because it quit working, one of the front struts went bad at 40,000 miles. It developed a coolant leak at 61,000 and needed a new turbo and water pump. The stereo has horrible sound and the Bluetooth often doesn’t work right. I have to keep trying to get it to understand who to call. Also the blind spot warning is glitchy and often stops working. The steering is too sensitive and there is a huge blind spot in the rear and a huge pedestrian hiding blind spot in the front door posts. It’s zippy to drive, but kinda gutless at 0-60. The only good things about this car is that it gets amazing gas mileage, holds a lot of junk, and is comfortable in long trips. I was hoping to be able to keep this car for five years or more, but that isn’t going to happen. I’m done with GM cars. I’m switching to Toyota.

I bought this with under 10,000 miles and have had issues since day 1.

No outstanding maintenance issues so far - regular wear and tear stuff. Although there is plenty of room in the back seat for friends, this car struggles to move through the gears with the weight of 4 adults on hilly New England highways. It's perfect for a driver and a passenger on a road trip. The back seats easily fold flat for luggage, coolers, golf clubs and beach umbrellas. Love the profile; especially the waterfall grill. So bummed the external profile changed. I would honestly buy this car all over again if they ever bring back the original profile with the waterfall grill.

buick,encore,2015,Christian, 02/06/2016,Downsizing to Premium Luxury,5,"This is a review of a loaded 2015 AWD Premium Encore. We have put over 500 miles on it. We had originally decided on an Encore but were dissuaded from taking a test drive by professional reviews which were critical of the power. Our family is accustomed to driving powerful and speedy vehicles (Volvo S60 T6/Ford F-150/Toyota Sienna AWD) with the exception of a four cylinder Ford Fusion (reliable but slow as molasses). The Encore is replacing the Sienna and the Fusion is being handed down to the newest teenage driver (slow is good here). Neither of us adults wanted to drive a car that struggles to reach speed or climb hills.  So we explored other options like the Ford Escape, Nissan Murano and even considered another Sienna for its excellent comfort and unsurpassed people and cargo comfort/capability and low price for an AWD. (We need AWD). However, the Sienna AWD is loud- annoying on long trips. So we had forgotten all about the Encore but on a trip to the dealership decided to take one for a test drive, ready to be underwhelmed and sorely disappointed. The salesperson encouraged us to take a long test drive on the interstate expressway, which we did. We were very surprised and impressed with the acceleration of this little 4 cylinder, and while we weren't winning any races, acceleration to traffic (65 mph), merging and even passing was more than acceptable.  The turbo clearly making a difference. Once at cruising speed the cabin is exceptionally quiet and peaceful. The leather seats are very comfortable, with lumbar adjustment. Two adults have ample room and comfortable seating in the rear for long trips. A third adult can fit for shorter trips (1hr or less). The Premium edition is jam packed with technology and features that almost defy belief in a vehicle which we negotiated for just under $28k (Navigation, heated steering wheel (can never go back) and seats, rain sensing wipers,  power seats, voice controls, blue tooth, wi-fi, Sirius radio, On-star, rear camera, blind spot radar, rear traffic crossing alert, lane departure warning, ambient lighting, Bose stereo, remote start and more.)  The heightened ride height of this SUV gives a nice view of the road and enhances one's feeling of safety. The Encore is extremely nimble and shines in city and supermarket lot driving and parking. It is an all around relaxing and stress free drive in mixed driving conditions. We are so happy with our choice- one we almost missed out on.  If you have any doubts just take one for a drive.

buick,encore,2015,Jeff, 07/28/2015,New 2015 FWD,5,"Where to start? Been Toyota people for decades. Buick brought us back to GM. Certainly not built here nor does it have a majority of American made parts. Point is the Buick dealership wanted our business and had a smart, sharp looking vehicle to offer us. A week in to it and my wife and I both love it. Plenty of space for the two of us, empty nesters, and plenty of pep to get us around town and so far to where ever we want to go. Looks, feels and drives like something that will last us for years to come. At our age we have driven alot of new cars. This does not feel cheap. On par with more expensive vehicles we've owned. And alot of features you'd look for in higher end cars and SUV's. I have no reason to suggest not buying or leasing a Buick Encore.....so several months into it. Having hauled furniture, been through some decent snow fall and taken some short trips, we still are very comfortable and pleased with the Encore.

buick,encore,2015,Dave torres, 02/18/2016,Awesome Vehicle,5,"I've owned car for 11000 miles. Car seat for infant fits, electronics is amazing, fit for a tall person is good. Handles well, rides well, fairly quiet. Very comfortable to drive, with turbo you get fair to good acceleration and great gas mileage! The ultimate compliment...I would buy this car again! I have a bad hip, but I have driven this car all day without pain. Not for a big family, but if just you and spouse....maybe 1 child...it's great. Bigger family would have to move up to enclave.
"
buick,encore,2015,tucsoncacti@gmail.com, 02/05/2016,Excellent CrossOver,5,"First off let me say this, if you have not researched this vehicle class, then complain about speed and ""pickup"" it's your own fault. If your going in knowing your buying a heavy vehicle, that is sporting a turbo'd 135+ HP engine good for you. Guess what, it's not going to launch from a full stop at a stop light or stop sign. Something very evident when you test drive the car. BUT, getting up to full speed, or highway speed is quicker than you would expect. Also passing on the highway is smooth and effortless. 

So all that aside do I like my purchase? HECK yes I do! I went from a V6 300hp Nissan to the Buick, and while I miss the HP, I love the Buicks quiet smooth ride, excellent Bluetooth hands free setup and recognition. Sirius XM sounds wonderful compared to my wife's 2014 Chysler 300C, and having a 120gb IPod classic, setup was a breeze via the USB. (You could also just use a USB stick if you want to change your music more frequently) Night time ride is nice, with minimal blind spots for lane changes, and excellent head light beams. The 4GLTE wifi works surprisingly well but can get pricy really quick on larger GB plans. I do mostly highway driving, and average 31mpg and an average of 69 to 83 mph. 

Only real draw back I feel I am missing is the dimmed rear view mirror which I feel is standard on cheaper model vehicles, push button start, and door handle push button lock/unlock (this usually comes standard with push button start vehicles). Overall I would give this and overall score of 4.5, with forgoing the bells and whistles of other vehicles in this price range for quietness and a very smooth ride.

buick,encore,2015,Mark Hamilton, 09/06/2015,Hey Guys...a great small SUV from Germany!,5,"Yes it's true, this car was designed and engineered by the German Opel division and marketed as a Vauxhall Mokka for the UK and an Opel Mokka / for the Europeans and rest of the world. This South Korean made and assembled vehicle is called a Buick Encore for the American market. This mini SUV handles very well in the typical prowess it has been bred with. Great economy with about 36 mpg on highway if you stick to lower speeds, lots of airbags including the standard all important knee air bags, excellent safety alerts,nice leather, love the perfectly located driver's arm rest and all the standard trip monitor system. The seat is very comfortable and perfectly sized. Acceleration is decent and adequate for highway passing. Free maintenance for two years. 

The eye catching size and design is a type of vehicle and market that Toyota started with their little 167"" RAV4 some 16 years ago! GM cleverly re-invented that class of SUV that was abandoned about 10 years ago by the main players as they had all grown about a foot! The 1.4L Turbo Encore has very good looks, great interior, optimal usage of space, great economy and very good power for it's size and class. A great SUV for younger, older folk or empty nesters. Critics have stated a 'lack of power and space', what?? This IS SUPPOSED to be a 168"" SUB Compact SUV, not a Porsche, if you want more power and space you can easily jump up into the 180"" (15') Compact SUV class! For 2016, Buick has released the more powerful updated 1.4L Turbo DI engine with 153 HP and 177 ft/lbs torque, available as a Sport Touring which should make the power hungry drivers happier. Bear in mind, a lot of the other sub compact SUV's have the mindless whining belt and pulley CVT transmission system and the Encore is one of the few still using a lovely smooth 6 speed automatic. No doubt the best looking and one of the best choices in the Sub Compact SUV class.

buick,encore,2015,john lee, 05/12/2016,Great ride poor performance,2,"Was slightly hesitant when I bought this. Initially was satisfied but I have brought it back 3 times for transmission shifting poorly. Was told its normal for this vehicle.  Too bad!  Over the mild winter of 2016-2017 the AWD system shut down on me on 2 different occasions.  The first time the dealer had it within the hour of the occurrence and let me know this is normal, the system shuts itself down if it overheats.  The solution- wait for the AWD to cool down then resume driving.  It was a medium snow and I had been driving about 3 minutes when this happened.  The second time it was snowy again I had new tires on the car and again the AWD shut off.  Of course the Dealer found nothing wrong, so mid March I traded it in for an AWD Chrysler 300, best move I made, the Buicks AWD system is very poor, and the Dealer's response was just as bad. UPDATE: I TRADED IT IN IN MARCH 2017 FOR A CHRYSLER 300.  THE ENCORE WAS PROBABLY THE WORST PERFORMING CAR I EVER BOUGHT

buick,encore,2015,A.B., 05/12/2016,I traded my VW Tiguan for an Encore.,5,"The comfort is great, Very quiet ride.  Ok it doesn't have as much power as my Tiguan which I miss in times when taking off and getting on the Hwy.  Once on the road, the ride is very pleasant, much more quiet compared to the Tiquan.  The back seat is not meant for tall people. The bench is pretty narrow, but I don't often have passengers riding in the back.  What can I say about cargo space other than it is a compact car, and therefore space is limited but still offers plenty room and hight.  If I need more space I can always fold the backseats down.  To me the Encore Premium offers plenty of luxury, comfort and it is a gas pleaser and eye candy  inside out.
"
buick,encore,2015,Richard, 07/14/2017,Good comfort and value in a small package,3,"This car is classified as a ""CUV"" (compact utility vehicle), not an SUV.    It is built on a car chassis, and not designed to be a heavy workhorse.   That being said, I have been amazed at what can be transported in it, when the rear seats are folded flat, and the passenger front seat is lowered.   This included a large chest of drawers I hauled over 100 miles, with many other items packed around it.    It is a perfect ""empty nester"" car, economical and easy to park and drive.   The pluses are a competitive initial cost, very good warranty, good fuel economy (30 mpg overall), and a very quiet ride.    The negatives include a somewhat cheap plastic interior, brakes that ""moan"" sometimes when cold, lack of a built in garage door opener, and lack of a power rear gate.   I would also like them to have thought of designing a ""scuff plate"" below the rear gate, so the paint on the bumper is not scratched when moving items in and out of the back.   Overall, I would give it 4 of 5 stars, which is the highest mark I would give any vehicle in this class.     The pluses far outweigh the minuses with this vehicle.

Shortly after buying the vehicle, while en route to U of M, the car broke down due to a coolant leak, which wasn't an easy fix, so we had to leave the car half way into our trip and pick it up several days later. Next, some time of mold was growing in the ventilation system, causing a sour odor to come through the vents. The fix was not really a complete fix. We're stuck with a loud blast of air that comes through the vents, whether we're in or out of the car and whether the engine is running or not - makes me jump out of my skin when we're in heavy traffic, and we have a problem with episodes of musty air. My husband has lung disease, so bad air sends a red flag. Next, the power brake booster went out and then within 2 weeks, the battery died. If I trade the car now, I take a loss in addition to the repair bills I have already paid. We will never buy Buick again.

I want a replacement car because this seems is an anomaly based on my prior purchases and other reviews i have read.

buick,encore,2015,JIM NICHOLS, 10/01/2015,"Fun, Sweet Interior, Efficient",5,"The Encore is an ideal car for someone who ants more carrying space than a car, but not the 14MPG of a big SUV. The interior is really well appointed for the class that it is in. The engine is small but more than adequete for this speed limit driver. Acceleration speed is good, though the RPMs go a little high with foot onthe floor. But for me that situation doesn't come up much. It's comfortable, easy to park, and has lots of features that son't expect for a car in the $20Ks. It's quite cute, and people are generally surprised that it's a Buick. It's made in the US in a UAW plant which matters to me.
Update: I just submitted a review of this car and made an error in it. I said that the car is made in the US and it is not. It is made in South Korea. Otherwise the review was an honest assessment, but I want to be cognizant of people (like me) to try to buy US made products

buick,encore,2015,Gail C., 02/11/2019,Reliable Compact Utility Vehicle!,4,"I have have owned my Encore for 16 months now and have driven about 18, 000 miles.  I bought the vehicle used with 15,000 miles on it.  It gets Very good gas mileage (average 31 MPG).  The Encore handles fairly well and looks stylish.  It appears to be a fairly reliable vehicle and a nice vehicle for a single woman.  The rear cargo area is small and you will not fit a whole lot unless you put the rear seats down to expand the space.  I did have one issue at 32,000 miles, the battery died with little to no warning.  I am hoping that I just got a faulty battery and that there isn't a design defect that drains the battery.  I also like that this vehicle has a better warranty than most vehicles.  I like the Convenience package as it has a rear camera, rear sensors and side warning light on the mirrors.   I am pleased with the Encore and am hoping to have it around for several more years.

buick,encore,2015,Grandpa Moses, 06/29/2016,Can't understand what grandpa actually likes?,1,"Have had a few of these since having my Volt repaired, which in comparison is an early 00's MB of quality and refinement.. but that's still about as reliable as a moped with one wheel.. The buick is a nicer car than a volt, in that it feels like there will be a lot of problems, but if you are handy you should be able to resolve most of them. The MPG is poor, best i could see was 18City, and 25highway, which is about 5MPG less than the 4cyl rav4 my wife has. The Interior is actually pretty nice, but there are a lot of creaks when going over uneven pavement. They used very cheap bushings on the suspension, which doesn't wear well, and clunks in the cold. The Car has a lot of midrange power, it's a decent highway cruiser, though it is terrible in the town, and city. It's not easy to see out the back of, and the automatic transmission is terrible, since there is zero low end torque.  This little SUV is what i would call a luxury version of a Geo Tracker, but honestly the tracker at least knew what it was.. The seats are very narrow, and i am 6'3"" tall 175Lbs, so by no means fat, but my narrow behind doesn't fit between the bolsters of the seat. The seats however are pretty comfortable for short narrow people, or if you are 9, because the seat bottom is very short, so if you have short legs, this might be OK for you. The cargo room is about 1/2 the size of the Volt, and the driving position is about 4in too far to the right of the steering wheel, you actually can't position yourself dead center or you will be sitting on the door panel. The electronics are actually pretty good, the smart cruise control doesn't work, and the lane departure stuff thinks that over passes are cars immediately in front of you, and locks the brakes up when you approach them, but the radio is fantastic, the navigation is google good, the bluetooth is easy to use, and simple to setup, the climate control however, is slow, it takes about 20min to warm up in the winter, and about 30min to get to maximum cold on the AC, which maybe i have been spoiled by the EV volt, which takes about 2min on each, but it's still a long wait. The Auto Stop feature is interesting at lights, but honestly a 1.4ltr 4 pot doesn't need this, if anything it will eventually prematurely wear out the starter, and in a GM it's just one more thing to break. The Car isn't terrible and is a really good attempt on what a small SUV should be, but it was just not done well.. It feels like the designers wanted one thing, but GM lawyers wanted the cheaper option, and the dealers are caught in the middle.

My Buick dealer told me there is nothing that can be done to correct the problem.   Adjusting the DIC panel lighting is ineffective. The only solution is a different automobile for an ADDITIONAL $20-25,000 - (ie: a GMC Terrain) so buyer beware.  I am using my ""old "" Garmin GPS to monitor ground speed but the DIC is virtually useless.   I test drove the Encore on a cloudy day, big mistake.

With kids now in their later teens and no need for large car but with seating up higher, the Encore was selected. The ride performance from the smaller turbo is better than most pro reviews in that their expectations for 0 to 60 are only satisfied when buying an eight cylinder Camaro or that ilk of car. The comfort and quietness make this a great ride. The luxury features with the saddle leather and roof make it seem a lot bigger than it is. Before believing the Mazdas, VWs or Toyotas are in the same class as the Encore, make sure you test drive it first. It will grow on you!  "

buick,encore,2015,Greg, 03/14/2019,Small and quiet,5,"The Buick Encore is an amazing small SUV. Bought in 2015, it stopped our car shopping as the 3rd vehicle test driven. It was that good! With only 2 of us, the size and cargo space didn’t seem to be an issue.  The best part of the car was the quiet. We could hold a normal conversation on the road at 65 miles per hour. We could talk on the phone through the car’s system and not yell at the person on the other end. After 4 years, the only maintenance we needed was oil and filters. The only small negative is the actual interior room. If only 4 people are transported with very little luggage, it is an awesome car. Add larger people and more luggage and you’ll notice the squeeze.

buick,encore,2015,BA Murphy, 06/15/2020,Nothing but problems over the last year,1,"2015 Buick Encore with leather and navigation is only 5 years old with less than 70K miles and had given me nothing but problems over the last year. I was originally introduced to the Encore when I got it as a rental when my previous car was in the shop and I loved it! It was a good little car for the first few years with fair gas mileage, a nice design, and a smooth ride. Definitely a tight fit for several adults and the sound system is seriously lacking but other than that no complaints. However, during the last year it  has been in the shop on multiple occasions. First the oil handler went and cost ~$800 to diagnose and repair. Most recently the engine over heated with my two little ones in the car which forced a ‘power saver’ feature to kick on and the power steering went out. Currently waiting on a call back from the dealership since the car won’t stay on now even after jumping (shuts off as soon as the cables are removed). I definitely expected more from a 5 year old Buick with less than 70K miles!

buick,encore,2015,candy k., 06/08/2019,Wouldn't u really rather drive a Buick? I do!,5,"I purchased my Encore 10/7/2018 from my bf directly from his lease. Needless to say I got a great deal! GM had even been out to inspect for return to the dealer and everything passed. Just under 29,000 miles on it so I know I will be driving it for a long time. MPG is great, hwy is 28 MPG and in town is 23. The interior is very rich looking and comfortable. Heated seats and steering wheel. Rain sensor wipers, front and back. All the collision alerts, lane departure and side mirror blind spot lights make me feel very attuned to traffic around me. Bose system is fantastic. The GPS could be a little more user friendly, such as the app on my phone is. I have reported to the dealership that the information/entertainment screen has actually shut down completely at least once. I did have my phone charging through the usb port but my phone is dying  (shuts down) and with it connected as USB device, they thought that might be the issue. When the light sensor cuts the dashboard lights during the daytime it is a significant drop in visibility but I can still see it. I went from a 2011 KIA Sorento which was a little tall to get into even with the running boards I added, so the Encore is a better fit for me. The only real issue I have is the reduced cargo space in comparison to the Sorento. But it balances out because the Encore is so easy to drive and park. It handles like a little sports car!! I love my Encore!

buick,encore,2016,Sanjay, 03/04/2016,The best short term lease subcompact crossover!,4,"I've leased the electric blue base model of this car after test driving Mazda CX-3, Fiat 500X and Honda HRV. I wanted a compact car where I can sit slightly above the road and getting in and out would be easy on my lower back. I am a recent graduate and due to less credit history, most dealers rejected lease but the folks at Buick were great - they offered a 2-year lease at a decent price. The car is extremely comfortable and the driver seat comes with electronic adjustments and excellent lumbar support. I cannot find words to stress on how comfortable the driving experience is! It's interiors are great for a base model with leather accented seats, generously sized dashboard buttons and good leg room in rear seats. It also has OnStar care and satellite radio. It's modestly powered by a 1.4L turbo engine which does the job for a FWD. Major concerns about this car is external noise, horrendous bluetooth music playback(the rep told me that bluetooth is for voice only) and flat, muffled sounding speakers.Due to the external noise, i need to turn up the music volume and the speakers just sound bad (remember, this is a base model without the Bose active noise-cancellation setup). Music playback via AUX, radio and CD sound better. I didn't realize that the speakers were bad during the test drive but I've leased it for 2 years only. Overall, I highly recommend this car in the subcompact crossover segment if you're not too particular about brands or you don't mind a less sporty car. This car scores over all others for driving comfort which mattered the most. If you're thinking about leasing this for 2-3 years, i'd say it is a definite go, but get the higher end model with sunroof and bose speakers as it's so much more fun and exciting to step into your car!

Nimble and responsive... fun to drive. After almost two years, no repairs needed and no squeaks or creaks. My grown sons can even get comfortable in the back seat.

buick,encore,2016,Marie, 02/07/2016,Perfect car for a retired lady who likes luxury!,4,"I love Buicks because, if you get a premium model, you get all the extras including heated steering wheel and remote start which are add ons in other cars. I was intending to buy a Buick Regal, but was unhappy with the lack of visibility in my previous Buick sedan. The salesman suggested I test drive an Encore as well as the Regal. I loved the Encore! The visibility was much better, I enjoyed sitting higher up, and it was easier to park. Granted the trunk is rather small and there probably isn't much leg room in the back seat, but I rarely have a rear seat passenger, so that is fine. Also  important to me is that it has OnStar with Turn by Turn navigation and hands-free calling. This is a perfect vehicle for a retired lady who enjoys a certain amount of luxury in her car.

Now that summer is here, I'm finding the air conditioning very comfortable and responsive. There is no cold air blowing on my hands. When I turn the temp higher or lower, I feel the difference immediately.

I now have had my car 13 months. I do miss the large trunk I had in previous cars. I often end up putting things in the back seat because they do not fit in the trunk. Also I find that I hear quite a bit of road noise when driving. I often have to turn up the radio because of the road noise. When I drive through a puddle, there is a loud roaring sound. The first time I heard it I thought my tire was falling off or something. These are things I can live with and the overall good looks and easy handling of the vehicle balance them out.

I did have one huge disappointment. A few months ago I drove over a pothole at the side of the road and ended up with a dented rim. In nearly sixty years of driving I have never before had a dented rim. Then I found out that, because rims these days are made of an aluminum alloy rather than steel, it could not be repaired. I ended up paying $500 to replace the wheel. This was not covered by the warranty. This failing of materials used in the wheels I cannot accept. This is wrong!

buick,encore,2016,Sam Fam, 07/07/2016,A Great Buy!,5,"After owning Hondas and Toyotas for several years, I thought buying my new car would be a breeze as the new Honda Accord looks beautiful. However, for safety reasons I did not want a car with ""Push Button Start/Stop""  or electronic parking brake. So my choices narrowed down to a few models. However, test drive of the Honda Accord was a complete disappointment because of the cheap materials used inside for everything including side panels, fabric etc. Plus the car was extremely noisy which I never expected. So I started research on all the other cars available out there that look beautiful, have a reliable history, used quality materials, and satisfy my requirements I mentioned earlier. Based on photos and reviews, I kept coming back to Buick Encore which I decided to buy outright after test driving it. So far, I have not been disappointed. My husband who was a little skeptical earlier loves the car too and so do my kids. Also with 20% rebate from Buick + dealer discount, I got a great deal on the car.

buick,encore,2016,Philip Prigge, 05/15/2019,Acceleration Good. Easy Getting in-& out,5,"3 years driving now.  I am long-legged male and like how easy it is to enter & exit car.  It never feels small - like a sub-compact car should maybe feel, rather, it feels spacious for what I need.    This is the first car I've ever driven where I don't need to push the front seat all the way back.    The 2016 Buick Encore Sport Touring is comfortable for my 6' 3"" friend and my 5' 3"" wife.   The car's elevated height, i.e., the driver's high perch, makes it easy to see traffic.  The perch is as high, or higher than, most other compact SUVs -and this is only a sub-compact suv - makes me happy.   I truly appreciate the ""Blind Side Monitor Alert"" (""BSM"") & ""Rear Crossing Traffic Alert"" which come standard with all Trims except Base trim - this is a good value cuz even '19 cars don't make BSM and RCTA standard on many trim levels.   The BSM is big assist while driving - improves my smoothness as a driver, i.e., no sudden swerves cuz I missed something in my blind spot.  The acceleration meets our needs, i.e., acceleration is not a problem.  Back seat leg room is fantastic - nice for my friends sitting back there.  I get 30 mpg per fill-up even though much city driving.  I think the 2017 has better info/entertain screen & setup.  ""Engine Auto Off"" at stop lights doesn't bother me.  The noise cancelation system works well - makes 60 mph trips pleasant.  Driver visibility is excellent - I got spoiled driving Subaru Forester- which I think is perennially rated #1 for Driver Visibility - so I appreciate the ease of visibility while driving.  It's easy to park and to track the front corners because hood slants downward.  I'd prefer a gas cover door that needs to be released from inside.  The favorable Warranty of 4-years / 50,000 miles made my decision to acquire this car easy - after I'd done my other research and did test drive.  I am 70 years old - this the most pleasant driving car I've ever had.  This is the first luxury car I've ever owned.
"
buick,encore,2016,Jody, 07/08/2016,Plenty of Acceleration,5,"I read quite a few reviews that suggested that the Encore is a bit sluggish. Though I would not take it out on the autobahn, we were very happy with the Sport Touring trim (new for 2016) that has a slightly more powerful engine and AWD. During the test drive, I practically demanded that we take the car out on the freeway and drove several miles out of the way to do so. I'm so glad I did as acceleration was more than sufficient to deal with traffic on I-95 near Philadelphia (if you know the area, you will know that is no small feat). Remember, this is a compact SUV - you don't need a 6- or 8- cylinder engine to pull this weight. In terms of interior comfort and size, I am more than impressed. There are plenty of storage options, totally flat-folding seats, and a 60/40 split bench seat that grants an extra amount of flexibility. We have a pretty good-sized dog and her accompanying crate (24""x36""x36"") and we were able to get the crate into the car on the 60 side - thus keeping one seat in the back still open. Everything else has been great thus far and Buick has joined the rest of the car world by offering free maintenance for two years. All in all, we are quite pleased with the purchase.

buick,encore,2016,Fred, 07/28/2016,Compact Gem,4,"Love the styling. I didn't agree with the consumer reports description of ""plodding acceleration"". I had a V6 Hyundai Tucson prior and the acceleration on the Encore almost matches the V6 performance. The Encore has enough power to accelerate into the highway with no problem. I could have used folding side mirrors and the knob that adjusts the mirrors was much better on the Tucson than the Encore. The radio is difficult to program and maintain on the desired settings. Can't wait until my complimentary Sirus subscription runs out to have some of that extraneous stuff go away,,,

buick,encore,2016,brenda mitchell, 09/22/2017,Stop/Start technology .... SO ANNOYING !!!!!,3,"The stop/start technology is not ""smart"", if this auto is a somewhat a ""smart"" car then it should know the difference between being stuck in traffic and pulling into my garage !  I actually dislike the stop/start feature because the car shutters each time it restarts.  Overall driving experience is poor because most of my driving is around congested city streets with alot of lights.  Anyone thinking of this auto should consider another model with the ability to disable the start/stop when in traffic.  I get the economy of the feature and do not mind if that happens on open highway when in bumper to bumper traffic slowdown for considerable period of time.  In the short pit stop type driving that I do I find it very annoying.  I would not purchase this car again solely because of this feature.

buick,encore,2016,twiceencoreowner, 11/21/2016,Engine Auto Start Stop Feature,3,"After owning another Encore (2015), I traded and I bgt the 2016 Sport Touring. I was excited as it had a gas saving feature called ""Auto stop"" plus a few cosmetic extras.  At first this feature was intriguing but after 5 mos of it starting and stopping all the time at traffic lights etc it became a real nuisance. The  A/C also changes temp and gets hotter and fan slows down..also on heat as the compressor also shuts off.  I decided to take it to the dealer and have it disabled...unfortunately that isnt possible..for some damn reason?? Software issue or program design bug? Dealership and Buick wont offer any allowance for my gruntled issue on a new 2017 w/o this stupid feature either. So be damn sure you understand what this does before you get stuck with it on an Encore. To save 50c a week this isnt worth the BS to have it. I cant believe some moron engineer thinks he is saving the environment and gas mileage by starting and stopping an engine at every slow down..
"
buick,encore,2016,Lou, 03/24/2017,My big mistake!,4,"Before buying this car, you should know that it has a feature called ""Auto Stop/Start"". I blame myself for not having done any homework to find out its features. The salesman told me that the engine was a 1.4 liter turbocharged engine. He said ""1.4"", but I heard ""2.4' , which is what I was used to. He never mentioned the Auto Stop/Start. Basically this feature stops the engine at a traffic light when the car comes to a stop and the foot is fully depressed on the brake pedal. This feature is supposed to save a minuscule amount of gas, therefore conforming to some government set fuel efficiency standard. It really bother me that such a thing could be engineered into a car. The only way to keep the engine form stopping is to shift to manual or neutral. If you shift to neutral, you can shift back to drive and the engine will keep running. If you shift to manual, the engine will quit when you return to drive. The problem with manual is that if you leave it in manual and forget that you'll have to shift manually, you'll run the RPM up to the red line before realizing that you forgot to go to drive.                                                    This is a good car for around town, except for that feature. The gas tank holds only around 14 gallons, so that it appears to burn more than it does.

buick,encore,2016,Jordon, 06/20/2017,Terrible Vehicle,2,"Not a very reliable vehicle, mine is always in the shop. GM will not stand behind the vehicle. I purchased it new in November of 2016. If your looking for a smaller SUV my advice is to get a Rav-4 or a CRV. The cargo room is really small and to put down the back seats you must move the front seats all the way forward. I will say the Encore is comfortable and fuel efficient.
"
buick,encore,2016,Leland, 12/31/2016,exactly what I wanted,5,"I was in the market for a second vehicle to use strictly for work purposes. While I was originally looking at a late model used car, I decided to test drive the Encore, as with all discounts, the vehicle was in the price range I was willing to pay. I selected a base model with over $9800 in rebates/dealer incentives. The Encore rides as you expect from a Buick and for a base model, it comes well equipped. While some have wrote about the Encore's lack of pep, I have found it adequate. The braking and handling are excellent.  I fully expect this SUV will meet my needs.
"
buick,encore,2016,Jack, 04/12/2018,Smart little buggy,4,"It's small.  The cargo space is small.  It's tight, quick handling, but rather slow acceleration.  Smart crisp styling.  Strange little lurch off of a light or stop sign, but I believe it's part of the ABS system. Good balance of color and chrome, less than great windshield wipers.  ADD a passenger armrest!!!  The single driver only armrest is just bad design. Great tires as delivered. Floor mats could be better quality.  Overall a vehicle with quality materials, good entertainment suite with just a few design flaws.  Getting in and out is not hard, but the contour hump on the seat takes getting used to to get over and out. Again, don't cheap out and build a proper two person arm rest, OR, sell a kit to install a second.  Many Encore owners would thank you and purchase one to be installed.  Fast forward a couple of years, and the car performs well, is still a bit of a gas sipper.  It's a 2016 and by 2019, they still have not addressed the issue of the single arm rest in the new models, they are the same.  This one interior item would go a long way toward added comfort for the passenger and driver who have to share it airline style.  I have since removed the lower quality floor mats front and back and replaced them with the plastic Weathertech style mats which stay cleaner, and actually look better in this model.  I do believe that the 2016 models are the best looking of the bunch.  Later models have different fog lights, different trim and wheels and are a lot busier looking than the 2016.

buick,encore,2016,Joseph, 04/25/2018,This Buick is awesome!,5,"I compared this crossover to 13 other vehicles in this class: Nissan, Kia, Ford, Chevy, Dodge, Honda, Toyota, VW, Fiat, Subaru, Hyundai, Jeep & Mazda.  I looked at things like Style & Appearance, Reputation, Fit & Finish, Reliability, Length of time in Business (Automaker), Technology, Maneuverability and Miles per Gallon of fuel.  I did not test drive all of the above but did take several of them for a spin.  Some were rejected because of cost because a good deal of accessories are not included in the base price..The Buick line seems to be loaded with many standard items making it quite competitive with all the others when it comes to price.  By the time you add on features on most of these vehicles that you really want, they become very pricey.  The 'On-Star' feature with Buick is incredible:  If the vehicle is stolen, contacting On-Star allows them to disable the vehicles engine wherever it is.  Apparently the engine is slowed down automatically until the vehicle comes to a stop.  Also, if I grab a plane in California and realize I left my Buick unlocked, I have an app on my smart phone which will let me lock my doors from New York or anyplace else that I've flown to.

This concerns me, for it would indicate there is no feedback to the factory that there is a potential performance issue with the current Encore design, not to mentio the fact that if this symptom gets worse with time, there is no reference as to the fact that it was exhibited when brand new."

buick,encore,2016,Kent, 10/29/2016,Really nice vehicle ... but,3,"I came real close to buying a Buick Encore.  I really like the styling and trim.  And, the size is perfect for me.  I do question the 1.4L engine.  Turbo chargers do not favorably impress me.  Just something else to go wrong.  I finally took one for a test drive.  Did not seem to be as spunky as my 2.0L 2000 Tracker but maybe I could get used to it.  The Tracker is 17 years old now.  I bought it new in November of 1999.  I really do need a new vehicle now.  Sadly, I had to walk away from the Encore because of the dark tinted glass.  I am older now, don't see as well as when I was young.  Always have had some trouble seeing at night.  It gets worse when you get older.  You will understand that later.  Tinted glass is a real pain for me.   I don't care if people can see in.  I need to be able to see out, in every direction, front, back, and sides.  That is what is important and the Encore fails in that respect.  The Encore does not seem to be available without the dark tinted glass in the back.  That seems to be the case with most of the new SUVs.  Even the front glass is a bit dark for me.  I guess I am going to have to keep on driving my 1994 and 2000 4WD Trackers.  They go in the deep snow and on the ice.   And they can pull your boat and trailer out of the water at the lake shore.  The Encore can't even pull a small trailer.  And they call it a SUV.  I don't  know that AWD would be as good.  My Trackers do have very light tinted glass.  Don't even need that but it is tolerable.  Clear glass would be better.  I know the dark tinted glass is only in the rear but it reduces the available light throughout the interior of the vehicle.  I really need a new car but I can't find anything acceptable to me.  Everything has dark tinted glass and they all seem to have way too many buttons on the dash.  I can't drive and read the operator's manual at the same time.  I don't text and drive.  I like to be able to find the controls by touch.  I don't want to have to look for them.  I have to keep my mind on the road.  I don't want distractions.  This is all insane.  Aftermarket tint is readily available for all car windows.  Why do the automobile manufacturers have to force tinted glass on all of us?  It definitely is a serious safety hazard.

buick,encore,2016,J, 05/09/2016,"So close, and yet, so very terribly terribly slow.",2,"The size/shape and features of this vehicle are great.  The price is right.  It's one of the few cars that might convince me to buy American again (it's been more than 20 years).  It's surprisingly well-featured, quite comfortable, and fairly agile.

And then GM goes and put an absolutely anemic engine in it.  Zero-to-Sixty?  Maybe in 15 seconds with a tailwind -- which is going to cause problems getting on California's freeways and squirting in and out of traffic -- perhaps it's enough for states where they drive slower and more lawfully, but not here.  And this is on the increased-horsepower sport/touring model.  The base model is almost undriveable.

I know that GM has better engines in its lineup.  There's no excuse for not having the option to put 200-250 horses under the hood (look at the VW Tiguan and BMW X1 to see this done well).  That change would make all the difference, and it's an absolute shame how much the current powerplants completely ruin the car.

I have had the little SUV now for the past 3 days due to my Volt (which is a complete pile of garbage) being fixed again.. 
During that time i can say it is pretty good on gas, but the transmission is jerky, there is no snot at all in it, meaning it won't get out of it's own way.. the seats are too small, i am thin and tall, but the seats are way to short and too hard.. making it feel like you are sitting on a pick-nick bench.
The audio controls require a degree in computer science to figure out, nothing is labeled well, the steering column plastic isn't straight, and there are noticeable creaks and rattles when you hit bumps.. (The Loaner has 395 Miles on it) There is NO storage at all in it, there are nooks and pockets to store things around the driver, but the rear of it where you would put groceries, or other shopping things, or even a baby stroller, there is simply just not enough room back there.  

As per handling it may handle well, but it feels top heavy when you hit a corner which doesn't leave much confidence in the handling ability. 

Good: 
The BOSE stereo is amazing.. sounds fantastic.. 
The look of the materials makes it seem like a high end vehicle.. I mean until you realize, they are cheaply made.. 
Gas mileage seems pretty good for a small SUV (Very small)

Bad:

Seating position is 
hard short Seats
The telescoping steering wheel is worthless
it rattles

The basic design of the Encore is overshadowed by a ton of unnecessary  glam. An overpowering front grill and a lot of randomly placed chrome has basically turned the car into a distasteful quinceanera dress. And don't even consider having a front seat passenger that weighs more that 150 pounds as they will not fit in the seat.

Think long and hard before buying a car and then go and purchase one that you will get compliments on. The Buick Encore won't do that for you.

Poor resale value but no choice.  Back to a RAV4.  Great size, what we should have gotten instead but was trying to save $.  I do miss this car for the comfort and driving.  

UPDATED:  After 10K miles and 9 months of ownership, I have only a couple of negatives.  Price, without rebates, is excessive.  No passenger armrest is unforgivable.  Cargo area is a bit tight and I wish it had a bit more room for things.  Everything else is good or great, mostly great.  Front seats have helped with my neuropathy by supporting the back of my legs.  Car holds road at well over speed limit, handles great, and is like when I owned my Mini Countryman - like driving a go-kart.  Shifts great.  Enough power.  No complaints.  Everything has worked as it should and provides a good value when you consider rebates.  I would recommend this car to everyone and anyone.....most don't realize it, but this is one amazing car and will fit the bill for many even if they don't know it yet.  Headlights with fog lights on are simply amazing.  I've never owned a car I have enjoyed so much and am so glad to have.  Quiet ride.  Great radio.  Too many goods to mention.  


We purchased this about a week ago.  We've logged over 500 miles and while it is a good car in lots of ways, some basic things seem to have eluded the engineers at Buick.  Note, this is made in South Korea, not in the USA as would be assumed if it has the Buick name.  The biggest complaint I have to start out with is the lack of a passenger armrest, and the almost completely useless one attached to the driver's seat.  Come on, really, no center arm rest?  We didn't realize it during our short test drive, but it is very annoying.  Two adults sitting side by side in the front, are sucking up each other's oxygen.  The cabin feels cramped.  And that you could deal with if there were a stupid center armrest.  Many things about this car are great - gas mileage is about 27 mpg with mixed driving, and a quiet ride and decent handling of bumps.  Steering is easy and accurate, and easy to get into a parking spot.  The A/C and heat work well.  The car has a decent feel about it, not cheesy or junky.  It is smaller than other SUV's, and I'd say over priced for the size and functionality of this car.  BUT, we needed a less expensive car and still wanted an SUV, with AWD.  This, coupled with the 16% off from GM, it turned out to be the answer for us to downsize our car payments.  For the pricepoint of $25K after discounts, you get an SUV, with AWD, and a host of features that you could not get on other SUV's.  So, it fits the bill.  Awesome LED daytime lights, which double as parking lights and turn signals, LED tail lights and brake lights, which is really amazing.  Plus, fog lights.  Auto on/off lights.  Navigation.  Carplay (although it is buggy).  Side blind spot monitors in the mirrors.  Upgraded cool 18"" wheels with nice tires.  A real spare (mini spare, but not a can of flat fix).  And the car is overall a good value for the money, compared to the SUV I have for my use.  Without the 16% back,  I would not have bought this as it would have been out of my price expectations.  It isn't perfect, but for what it is, and what it cost, I'd say it is a decent value.  You have more leg room up front than you'll need.  This helps the back seat passengers, who could not fit unless the seats are slid forward.  The cargo area is small, but the rear seats do fold down and that opens up alot of space.  This fit our plan to shrink our car payments and provides a decent value with the 16% off sale.

buick,encore,2017,Karen, 01/26/2018,Great Little Car!,5,"This awd encore exceeded our expectations. Car has a premium look and feel. So far mpg has been excellent and the Encore drives very nice and has quite a quiet interior. Some road noise at highway speeds but the short wheelbase is to blame for that i believe. Only downside is storage capacity is somewhat lacking. But we have just one kid and it is not an issue for us. The rear seats fold down flat which is nice for additional storage. You can fold down either side or both leaving half of seating available for the kids car seat. Also the front passenger seat folds down flat for additional storage for those longer items you may transport from Ikea etc, All in all very happy with this vehicle and got it for a great price during GM's 25% off msrp sale. On side note the basicwarranty is longer on the Buicks as compared to the other GM products.

buick,encore,2017,Bruce Borgerson, 02/10/2020,The Goldilocks compromise car,4,"Not too big, not too small.  Good gas mileage but not great. Adequate performance but but strains when pushed hard.  More than basic but not too fancy.  Better than average reliability.  In other words, the Encore has turned out to be a good -- and affordable -- compromise.  In its class, it excels only in that it is blissfully quiet at highway cruising (the active noise cancellation really works).  But it will growl when you floor it.  We scored ours in 2019 with only 21k miles for a hair over $16,000.  Overall, as happy as was Goldilocks with her porridge.
One year update:  An annoying steering clunk fixed under warranty.  No other problems. This was a downsize for better fuel economy when our son took our 2006 CR-V, but so far -- hauling everything from furniture to landscaping gravel -- no time when we couldn't haul something that would have fit the CR-V.

I'm like are you kidding one small arm rest for two people. The second thing that came out was when we both went to fasten seatbelts at the same time...""Not happening""...Thirdly This car may be perfect if you are a small person but if you have any size to you ""beware"" it gets a little close. Never ever try and put a full sized adult in the back seat. You do have one but maybe would work for a small child.

buick,encore,2017,Mark Hamilton, 09/08/2018,Improved Encore!,5,"Coefficient of Drag (CD) was improved from .37 to .33  which helps MPG, I get about 31 mpg mixed driving and up to about 37 mpg if I stick to about 65 mph on HWY, engine seems smoother, great feeling 6 speed automatic with good ratios, great handling and economy, better looking SUV and they removed the silly ""Buick"" symbols off the hood, dashboard a little better too with new larger display integrated and not separate with slightly simpler use, this is my forth and best Encore so far. Only complaint is Buick stopped showing Speed Limit signs on Navigation! They were shown from 2013-2016 then stopped, they need to update software to include it again for those having the Navigation. Otherwise it's still one of the very best Sub-Compact SUV's and engineered by Opel of Germany as an Opel Mokka! Still get early 30s mpg on HWY and around 27 city. Nice finish and no complaints.

buick,encore,2017,Sky C., 04/19/2020,Quiet Ride But Lacks Acceleration,4,"I test drove all the comparably sized/priced compact SUVs (Chevy Trax, Honda CRV, Nissan Rogue), and the Buick Encore was by far the quietest running/riding in its class.  While I was initially very impressed by the smooth ride and quiet cabin (Buick says they implement a sound dampening windshield and noise cancelling sound system), soon after purchasing I discovered its shortcomings.  Acceleration is extremely poor, which makes passing a risky proposition.  Also, because of the short wheelbase, when there are ridges or seams spaced equally apart on the highway it sets up a very unpleasant noise inside the cabin.  But for city driving, it's a quiet, easily maneuvered vehicle, and by timing the purchase to enable the maximum incentives to become available (I purchased brand new in late April of the next model year, when dealer incentives were significant), I got the exact same vehicle as the next model year (no changes were made to the design and amenities whatsoever; only the addition of an auto stop/start system which I did not want in my vehicle anyway).  This enabled me to get the AWD version for less than the next year's identical 2WD.  Interior amenities are a little more upscale than the competition, and the sound system is quite good.  Encore is a good value for the price, just be aware the most OEM replacement parts have to ship from South Korea or China, and that adds a tremendous amount of time for repairs to be completed (awaiting arrival of replacement parts). 
(Updated 10/21/20):  After just two years (and too many situations arising where trying to merge with freeway traffic became actually dangerous due to the total absence of acceleration in this tiny “turbo” engine), I’m looking to get into a different vehicle, as this one has proven too dangerous with no available acceleration when needed above 50 mph.  "
buick,encore,2017,Terri from NY, 09/14/2020,Love the small luxury SUV,4,I love the small size since I am the primary person in it and gas mileage is great.  It's a bit small for my husband who is a large pickup truck owner.  And carrying grandkids or a large amount of stuff gets hard to fit.  Plenty of engine power and great in the various 4-season road conditions.  Only complaint is that the brakes and rotors needed replacing at 37000 miles.  They should last longer than that!

"
buick,encore,2018,JWu, 08/30/2018,What a nice little car,5,"So I think this all needs to be prefaced with remembering what the Encore is meant to do.  It's not a sports car, it's not a rugged truck, nor is it a full blown luxury crossover.  Plus, consideration needs to be made for end of year lease deals (and purchase deals for that matter), as price has to be a major factor in how impressive it is.  The car is NOT by any means fast.  It's basically slow and down on power.  However, it is enough for the city and adequate for road trips.  Just step on it harder over the hills.  I was worried before I took it on my first long trip, but it had no problems cruising along at ... the speed limit... and maybe sometimes a bit higher.   The ace though, is how quiet and comfortable this thing is.  After combined 5 hours of driving, I had no aches or pains, was not fatigued at all, and felt the time and miles passed very quickly.  Even better, I averaged 34mpg for the day, which included some stop and go and city driving too.  My regular commutes still get 28-30 mpg, so rather satisfied.  Surprisingly, the chassis and handling feels nice and tight, not at all what I remembered of buick of before.  Brakes are ok - progressive pedal.  At the Preferred level (I feel it's basically the base model), the interior still feels nice enough to be close to premium levels.  The car has great use of interior space at minimum exterior size - great for city stuff.  All in all, I am so pleasantly surprised by the refinement of this tiny thing.  With deals putting it on par with some of the cheap economy cars, why not?!  Fabulous

buick,encore,2018,Mary Morris, 02/19/2018,Best car that I have owned.,5,"This is a great ""small SUV"" with the feel of luxury like no other vehicle in its class.  Blind spot monitor, lane change warnings, front crash warnings; back up camera with warnings.  Perfect for us older citizens as we age.  Great technology with navigation, bluetooth and more.  Add Onstar support and Sirius/XM entertainment.  Both driver and passenger front seats are heated with power adjustments.  You can set and save seat adjustments for both driver 1 and 2 and then sync each of those to the respective key faub.  Driver seat has ""easy exit"" feature letting you get in and out without effort.  Panoramic windshield combined with seat adjustment gives me a great view of the road.  Also the overall length is much shorter than a Honda CRV or Toyota RAV 4; easier handling and parking. Keyless start lets you leave keys in your purse.  Remote start is great on those cold winter days.  Another tech gadget has 3 buttons programmable to different garage door openers - yours, his and another important person.  The longer wheelbase provides a very comfortable ride with very little road noise.  Since I have owned this vehicle a very short time, it has not been possible to see if the gas mileage measures up to the EPA rating of 26 City and 31 highway.  Although no one likes to drive in snow, I am actually looking forward to see how this AWD version handles the snow.  All my other cars have been front wheel drive only so we will see.

buick,encore,2018,NC neuron, 07/01/2018,Not just for old people!,5,"Ever since I was a kid I've always thought about driving a Buick. I remembered it was quiet, smooth and just felt good sitting inside one, but I didn't buy one because of its stigma of being something grandparents drove. The last car I had bought was an Infiniti G37x. It's definitely a nice ride, but a premium gas guzzler. Recently I had a suboptimal customer experience during my last service at the Infiniti dealership, so bit the bullet and went across the street and test drove a Buick Encore, and never looked back. It's still the same as I remembered Buick as a child- quiet, smooth, and now that I'm driving- great visibility, handling and safety features...just a very nice comfortable ride in a highly reliable car. I am not a car mechanic, so safety and reliability are important features to me in selecting my vehicle. Plus, I'm now saving more than half at the pumps with a bigger crossover than my last sedan. I am so happy with my Encore and will probably drive a Buick for the rest of my life (and by then I will actually be old!)

buick,encore,2018,Lou Wagner, 04/27/2018,One Thousand Miles on a Rental Encore,3,"Overall, I found this small SUV quite good for a California vacation as it was large enough for luggage and fit easily in the small parking spaces for which southern California is notorious.  However, there was one glaring problem: the drivers side and center rear seat belts were partially missing.  We thought the missing parts were simply down beneath the seats, but extensive efforts to find them were fruitless.  We reported the problem to the rental car company when we returned it.  The car had only 700 miles on it when we rented it and was otherwise was fine, except the rear doors sometimes required a second hard slam to close them.  Beyond the apparent careless construction, the vehicle was just fine.  It was rather noisy on the highways, but that is likely due to the rough concrete highways in southern California.  The seats were comfortable and the controls relatively intuitive.  Parking, as expected with such a small vehicle was easy.  The engine had to work hard to get the car up to highway speed, but it was adequate.  The car was equipped with Apple CarPlay, which worked well with my phone except for seemingly randomly altering the volume.  Overall, the Encore offers a lot for the price, which appears to top out in the low thirties fully equipped.  There were several Encores on the rental car company lot, so it is likely that the car sells at a significant discount over sticker price.  We averaged 30.5 mpg over about 1,050 miles of mixed driving if the computer in the car is accurate.

I can state that the regular engine has well suited my needs (and I don’t have to put up with the auto stop feature of the optional engine). It is what it is...a small and tight ride. It’s perfect for my needs and excels in comfort, ride, and quietness. I’m totally impressed and content with my purchase. I get great gas mileage and if I need extra power to pass someone I use the sport shift and down shift from 6th to 4th gear and roar past them. No problem. I also have to carry around my musical gear and can easily do so in this car. I see why this one is Buick’s best seller. The build quality, interior quality and nimble handling make this a winner. Plenty of headroom is available yet the Encore doesn’t feel too top heavy when pushing around a corner. Nicely engineered.

The side view mirrors a bit small so you will need blind spot mirrors attached if you don’t have the detection upgrade. There’s also not passenger arm rest which is a bit odd. That’s it. The pickup on the high at first feels like... huh... then the turbo kicks in and you’re flying. It maintains high speed exceptional well and rides so smooth on all pavements. I’ve lots of complains about space but these people must be storing a full couch or something because there’s plenty of room and my friends have said it’s very comfortable in the back seat. The truck storage area is even large and holds plenty of you’re not the type of person who needs 40 suitcases at all times in their car.

buick,encore,2018,Alan Cortez, 08/19/2020,"Quiet, but Inferior Quality All-around",2,"Had the Encore for about two years now. Drive is somewhat quiet, little engine noise, but road noise is pronounced. 
It has Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, but they are laggy and unresponsive most of the time. For extra cash I use it for food delivery, and Android Auto was laggy and worse than just having the phone mounted. I've driven other GM vehicles with similar features when traveling, and they are hugely different. Why GM cheaped out on this car is beyond me. 
The Encore is severely underpowered, but more than that, the transmission is stupid. I live in a hilly area, and as such require low gears often for hill climbs. When I step on the accelerator, the vehicle is extremely delayed in responding, and when it does respond, it tries to shift into higher gears constantly for better efficiency. Mechanics say no mechanical issues, and I typically use premium fuel, so it's probably a manufacturer mishap. Manual mode helps somewhat, but it is frankly disappointing. Turbo lag is also very pronounced. However, gas mileage is decent.
Interior materials are cheap, plastics everywhere with fake chrome-tipped buttons everywhere. The attempt to make it luxurious has only succeeded in making it feel tacky.
Cargo space is tiny and rattles even though it is carpeted. 
My previous vehicle was a 20-year-old Toyota, and it got better fuel economy, better performance, and better comfort. That tells you enough!

It's great on gas as I only used less than a quarter tank in a week. Interior is great and comfortable. Radio and cabin is UTD as well. It's not the f'd fastest car, but I guess you wouldn't be looking for speed if you're looking for a mini SUV. Better than some other makes and models that are 2020

buick,encore,2019,Glen K, 01/03/2019,Never Thought I Would Own a Buick,5,"I am extremely impressed with the 2019 Buick Encore. This vehicle became a standout after I finished my research of the vehicles in this class.  The Encore is very nimble and handles well in most driving situations. I previously owned a Jeep Renegade and a Kia Soul, but neither of these two vehicles had the smooth ride and luxury feel of the interior that the Buick Encore possesses. I read the “CON” of the vehicle was lack of power of the standard engine. I found the engine to have more than ample power both in the city and on the highway. I never thought that I would own a Buick, but I am truly glad that I made the choice to purchase the Encore. The infotainment system is very user friendly. There were so many other SUV’s in this class that did not have the technology that this vehicle possesses. This Buick Encore is quiet and smooth and it feels much more like a luxury SUV. It is definitely worth the slightly higher price. I highly recommend this Encore to anyone seeking a quality subcompact SUV.

buick,encore,2019,Baby Buick in PA, 05/27/2019,Went back to GM and Buick!,5,"After owning a Ford for several years (traded a 2000 Buick Regal on that), I decided to give the Encore a look when it was time to trade. Small, fuel-efficient SUVs were on my shopping list - and it came down to the Encore and the Honda HR-V after reading reviews online. I would have also considered the Hyundai Kona had it not been for our local Hyundai dealer's bad rep. Comparing the Encore to the HR-V at our local auto show, I remember thinking, ""the Encore is a lot nicer inside."" It also had more equipment that I wanted, like a power driver's seat. To get that feature on the HR-V, you had to spend substantially more $ on the top-line Touring model, which also included other things that I didn't want like leather seats. A $5K rebate on the Encore was also hard to walk away from, and no compelling financial incentives on the Honda. Comparing the two, the interior headroom also seemed a lot better in the Encore. I was also leery of the long-term durability of the CVT trans in the HR-V - the Encore has a proper 6-speed automatic which seems to work very well. I bought the Encore Sport Touring AWD model with the base engine - I find the power to be more than adequate, but I won't win any drag races with it. AWD is a plus for our snowy winters. Ride quality and quietness are very good for a vehicle of diminutive size. Fuel economy seems pretty good so far, about 28-29 with 75-80% being highway miles each week. Compared to the trunk space in my former mid-sized Ford, the cargo space is decent for a vehicle with a small footprint. A fault of this vehicle is the missing center armrest for the front passenger - why? My recommendation to anyone considering one of these is to read the reviews from people who actually bought one, and pay less attention to the so-called professional reviewers who have only driven one for a few hours, a few days or a week at most. And to all the ""Buick bigots"" out there who dwell upon the stereotype of Buicks being an old peoples' vehicle - you're missing out on a capable, premium-featured vehicle that offers a lot of features and value for the money. As for me, I'm very satisfied so far at over 3K miles. I would definitely make this purchase again.

buick,encore,2019,Bob, 02/03/2019,The Sport Touring Model Is Sporty,5,"Leased a 2019 Encore Sport Touring FWD. The suv had most of the features important to my wife and me - power driver's seat , navigation, 18"" wheels, (we live in a potential flood zone), good safety rating, one button start and reasonable price.  The turbo engine has lots of pep, and the cabin noise level is very quiet, as advertised.  We downsized from a Nissan Rouge, so the cargo area is greatly reduced.  The visibility is excellent, as is the rear view camera an warning system.  Gas mileage has been 27 mpg in town and 30 on the highway.  The quality of the interior is excellent; better than the Nissan.  If I have a complaint, it is only that the Encore did not come with more advanced safety features like collision avoidance.  So far the suv has not had any problems requiring a visit to the dealer.  No squeaks or evidence of poor workmanship  at the factory.  FYI, the Encore is made in Korea.  Overall, we are very pleased with the Encore.

buick,encore,2019,Evonne Kochara, 05/07/2019,Awesome for a grandma,5,"I am a young grandma and empty nester. I wanted something fun and yet safe, but not too sporty for grandma. I saw this at the sales lot and my husband and I both said WOW, this was me. I love my little suv, it gives me luxury and fun, I can haul my groceries, my dog or we can go on a weekender in this sporty little suv. I would never thought I would drive a Buick, when I tell everyone I bought a Buick there first thought is a huge old person car, but when they see my cute, little SUV they are shocked that it’s a Buick. I love the look on their faces. I got everyone wanted.

buick,encore,2019,New to SUVs, 01/13/2019,Wow! GREAT SUV!,5,"My previous car was a 2008 Chevy Impala.  While I do miss the larger engine and trunk size of my prior vehicle,  this little SUV is great!  I am considered obese and find this SUV to be comfortable.  I wish the seats were a couple of inches wider, but the power adjustability of the driver's seat makes it comfortable; more than enough leg room and head room.  Leg room in the back seat was surprisingly good.  I LOVE the maneuverability of this vehicle while driving. I've never had such a vehicle that turns on a dime.  The highway ride is phenomenal; totally smooth and quiet.  This is the quietest vehicle I've owned while driving down the highway.  The trim model I selected (Preferred) doesn't have superior stereo quality (Bose) and I wish it did.  Otherwise I didn't find the Essence trim level to be worth the upgrades (price). The backup camera works great and is the first one I've ever owned and takes a little getting used to. Since the vehicle is new I can't speak to maintenance or reliability thus far.  Bluetooth and Apple Music works great.  Haven't tried the Android music link. The fan on highest setting  for climate control is a bit noisy and makes the stereo difficult to hear. The USB /Accessory port is difficult to access and I have to stand on my head to access. My biggest complaint is the armrest / console area; I would like the armrest to be longer and a bit wider.  The cup holders are RIDICULOUSLY SMALL.  I can barely fit a standard water bottle in the cup holder.  The lack of an armrest  for the passenger is irritating on long trips.  The drawer under the passenger seat was a nice addition.

buick,encore,2019,Buickman, 07/11/2019,LOVE MY ENCORE!!!,5,"Just bought the 2019 Preferred Model Encore AWD and I absolutely love it!!. I was worried that my wife and I (larger than average people) would be crowded in the Encore but we were surprised by the amount of room in it. Even if we have people in the back seats there is more than ample room for us to not feel squashed. I love the quality of the Buick brand and it is a very nice, quiet, fuel efficient ride. We also test drove a Chevy Trax and while it was nice, there is no comparison to the Encore, much higher quality. While it is a very ""techy"" vehicle everything is easy to understand and operate. I have only owned it for 3 days but I think I can honestly say it is the nicest vehicle I have ever owned. I bought it outright as I plan to keep it until it dies!! LOL I cannot say how effective the AWD is yet but from what I have heard I will be thankful I spent a little extra $ to get it come winter in Michigan. The 1.4L Turbo power plant is just fine for me and I love the gas mileage! Transmission shifts very smoothly and it handles like a champ!! Great job Buick!!

This model made it easy for him to get in and out and also provided lots of room.

There isn’t much to complain about, because it simply has everything I want and need. We leased this one, and I am already thinking of keeping it in the end!

buick,encore,2019,Betty, 02/04/2019,Downsizing a Commuter,5,"My last two vehicles were larger SUV, and while I will miss the cargo space, the ease in commuting traffic, and the gas savings outweigh the smaller cargo space.

It's easy to get in and out of, seats are comfortable and driving is a dream.  Love the rear camera.  The infotainment center is great.  Adjusting the driver seat has so many options.  You can adjust to fit a short person or a very tall person.  The way the rear seats fold to make a vast cargo area is so convenient.  The rear cargo area is okay but the expansion potential makes it great.  Turns on a dime and fits in any parking space.  The cover for the rear storage is sweet.

Best features: incredibly maneuverable in tight spaces, great fuel economy, very peppy turbo 1.4L engine, handles great on the highway as well as bustling city streets, great amenities, very quiet.  Features I wish Buick would offer as options: electric seat recliner (vs manual), electric tailgate, more expansive safety features like lane keep, auto braking, etc.  I searched extensively for a better value in a subcompact luxury SUV and couldn't find one - it is the best combo of performance, fuel economy, luxury features and price point.  The only other vehicle i considered was the new Cadillac X4 but it is insanely expensive.

We both love the way the back seat can be adjusted to a flat surface when additional room is needed. In addition the front passenger seat can be folded flat. The mirror adjustment controls serve their purpose and work fine, Buick should improve them and bring their appearance up to the rest of the vehicle. The bright headlight have a LED combination that lights up remote country roads, and look beautiful when they are not on. The design of the body is beautiful and classy. We love our Encore!

Its a zippy little buggy as I call it...just enuf room for my husband and i...the seats are comfortable - lots of front cabin room. The only thing I would like to see is a better arm rest and maybe one for the passenger . The middle console ( if you want to call it that ) is much to be desired from what we are use to...like the blind spot detection in the outside mirrors - also one of the features we wanted was Navigation and we got it..heated leather seats but no adaptive cruise control...which wasn't a deal breaker for us...over all if I had to do it all over again I personally think I would of chosen something MAYBE a little bit more roomier BUT like I said it's only my husband and I so what do we need all that space for  :P

buick,encore,2019,Tucson 2017, 03/24/2020,"Surprising good, quiet and efficient",4,"We recently purchased a new 2019 Encore Sport.  If you are looking for a small SUV, you should consider it.  The car is surprising quiet for a small car.  The rear space is more than adequate for normal shopping.  The Buick Infosystem is easy to use especially if you have had another GM vehicle.  The gas milage has been better than advertised in local traffic.  If you are tall, I am 6'4"", don't expect anyone to sit in the back seat behind you.  The acceleration is not the best but the vehicle gets up to highway speed without much problem.  The ride is surprising smooth for a small car.  There are a few features I would have liked such as forward collision warning and a built-in remote for the garage door that were not available in the model I purchased.  The vehicle has two USB ports that are a bit difficult to access.  If you purchase this vehicle, get an extra USB port for your phone and leave it plugged in.  The seats are comfortable and easy to adjust.  This model did not come with seat or mirrors that automatically adjust depending upon the driver.  The rear seats are divided and fold down to provide additional cargo space if you need it.  All things considered, I would definitely recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a small, economical SUV

buick,encore,2019,Isabella, 02/26/2020,Reasonably pleased with my Encore,4,"I was looking for something similar in size to replace my 2003 Toyota RAV4 and discovered the Encore. It handles well and is easy to drive and park. The seats are firm and driver height allows good visibility. There is no CD player and the radio is touch screen. I have had it just a few months and have had a couple of issues. First, the parking brake got stuck in the engaged mode and I had a little trouble getting it to release. I had already pulled away from the curb, as I assumed it had released all the way, but it hadn't.  It finally did and that hasn't happened since. On another occasion the car had been parked for a couple of days. I started it and put it in reverse, but it wouldn't engage; it just revved high, but didn't move. I shifted into park and then  back to reverse and tried again. It revved high again and then made a loud clunk as it finally jerked into reverse. I put it in drive and took it around the block to be sure it was okay. It made some loping sounds, but that stopped and I haven't heard it again. So, if it's been parked a couple of days I don't try to reverse first, instead I put it in drive and move forward. It's has only 138 HP, but still drives fine on the freeway and the gas mileage is decent. There are a couple of odd design issues that annoy me; there is no gas cap and the gas tank door doesn't lock. Another thing is that in every other car I've owned, you would press down on the control arm to start the windshield wipers, but in the Encore you push it up. Also, the side mirrors have a weird down slope design that impairs view, but you get used to that. The Encore is cute, quirky and easy to drive. All things considered, I am happy with it.

buick,encore,2019,Shaun , 03/14/2020,"Sophisticated luxury , simply packagwd",5,"Many pro reviews talk down about this car , and as a regular normal everyday consumer, I will say that the reviews  dont donit justice.
Buick has created a awesome , comfortable little SUV with the ENCORE, it comes standard with lots of features, a simple yet elegant infotainment , quality materials inside and lots of soft touch areas and storage. Yes a 6 foot adult can sit in the back seat comfortably , with room to spare, its cargo volume is plenty for the average consumer, great gas mileage, and a simple  very reliable turbo engine that is just fine and performs at a national average , compared to every other small suv in the class for under 30k$ . It's got stylez clean lines. A great comfortable quite ride, nice leather interior , LED daytime running lights  and tail lights, acoustic glass, push button start phone connectivity and bluetooth, onstar , a power driver's seat , proximity lock akd unlock, 1 touch up and down windows a great air conditioner and very nice premium 18 in wheels with Continental sport tires. 
Buick has delivered an affordable luxury entry level SUV, sure could it use a bit more power , what car couldn't, however this car feels well made , a safe option for older drivers and a reliable luxury option for younger. Drive the competition, and then drive this you will instantly notice the feel and look of its luxury branding that far surpasses other small SUVs on the market.

buick,encore,2019,JW, 09/12/2020,No wonder the American car industry is in decline,3,"Drove this car for four days as a rental car. It's an odd car to drive. The proportions feel off, with the car being quite tall but very narrow which creates a tree house effect which isn't reassuring on the road.  The engine is underpowered, fuel economy isn't anything to brag about and overall the car feels ""cheap"" as there is lots of hard plastic all over, the switch gear feels like it's going to fall apart any minute, closing the doors create as very hollow ""bang"". Some of the interior engineering is odd, too. For example, the adjustment for the seat recline is place right where the seat belt is, making it hard to find and difficult to get to.  On the up side, ApplePlay is well integrated and easy to use. Overall, the car drives, but why would anyone buy this car when you can get a bigger and much better RAV4 for just a $2-3k more?

buick,encore,2019,Bill in SF, 08/03/2019,"Rental, Not bad! 50mpg coming 2025",4,"I am not obese or elderly. I'm a financial auditor; based in San Francisco. My personal car is a Japanese Luxury SUV. I was issued a 2019  AWD model. I was fortunate enough to get a white fully loaded model. I was assigned a fraud case in Kitsap County. The FBI agent assigned to my case had a base Ford sedan. That's the difference in being gov't employed and working for the top financial auditing firm in the USA. Needless to say we used the Buick lol. 
The entire 7 days I had this car I was impressed. Given the amount The 1.4 lacked guts off the line. However, once the engine reached 3000rpm it pulled well. Given the amount of mismanagement, it was clear that charges would be filed. More agents arrived, the Credit Union and certain members of the staff disappeared. The Special 
Agent's car suddenly had 4 flat tires and smashed windows. The entire town morphed. We confiscated everything. We were able to pack all evidence into the Buick. That night after delivering the evidence to Seattle a Camry with blacked-out windows tried to pass. the little Buick pulled hard. The car warning lights worked to perfection. This car was amazingly equiped. It has a warning that lets you know that there is a car in you blind spot. The special agent drove and was able to prevent a possible overtake. Every time the Camry tried to pass, we were on a single lane road, the passing indication in the power side-view mirrors flashed and we were able to prevent it from passing. Unlike my Japanese car which is Japanese in every detail, the Buick didn't have sensitivity adjustments. The parking sensors were far too sensitive. Backing out of a side road we ditch the Camry. the sensors used to warn that someone or another vehicle was overly sensitive and I could not find an adjust to tune the sensitivity.  
The Bose entertainment console wasn't just a name. Spotify has a built-in eq. I was able to pair immediately. The system remembered my phone and everytime I entered the car remembered and paired immediately, it bumped. Listening to 2-Short and Bay Area Rapper J. Stalin and YG left me impressed! There are 2 subwoofers. One subwoofer in the trunk and one under the driver side passenger seat. While it wasn't super powerful, the bump would cause the mirrors to vibrate. After a full day of cranking the Bose audio, a rattle appeared. It was the tire change tools. GM finally makes a decent sunroof, I should say designed. I was disappointed that many of the parts shipped for final assembly were made in Mexico. Then shipped to Korea for final assembly. I wasn't consoled to learn that this car while ""American"" is American in name only. Tires were top-notch made in USA Continental Tires. This car was light, under 3000lbs! The light weight was evident. Panic stops hauled the Encore to a controlled stop. Light cars while great for gas mileage  slamming the rear hatch and the doors left a metallic echo. This hollowness wasn't apparent on the freeway. At the speed limit and above I felt like I was in a larger car. The Encore rides like a much larger vehicle. Quiet, On an evening road trip to Vancouver I was unable to hear much. This is a small car this delivers impressive technology. Drive and passenger semi powered seat. While the provides power assisted pitch, back and forth and lumbar, the back support is manual? That a huge omission! 
You won't regret buying this little car. You'll be pleased with the strong engine that delivers a solid kick. The dialed non-CVT transmission is best in class. That's right, for all the impressive engine management this car has gears. When the engine is floored the car shifts to stay in it's powerband. Shifts are timed perfectly. I had to smile when it shifted. The engine would pull like mad and keeps the power coming in gobs
Remember this engine is only 1.4 liters. The same size engine as those whiny little Fiats. The engine screams in
 protest if over-revved. Whiiiiiiinnnnnnnneeee! Great engine transmission tuning. 
Get your thrills while you can. 
All these Turbo engines while offering an apparent increase in performance and while modern, cars like the Encore are a dying breed. Starting sometime in 2025 cars like this will have to average a federally mandated 50MPG. CVT transmissions are coming. Companies like Subaru and Honda already have their entire lineups so equipped. Read Subaru reviews. Non-turbo, 4500lb outbacks powered by a 2.5lt engine. Snails. Before you're through paying for this car it will be junked. I know from experience that the average owner won't pay for the Turbo repairs. These turbo engines run crazy hot. All engine components including the plastic fiber intake manifolds become brittle and around 170,000 miles are done. A water pump change or even a head gasket means the front of the car needs to be dropped. Enjoy this car. Don't pay retail. Remember it won't last.

buick,encore,2019,kim2travel, 01/07/2020,Love my new 2019 Encore,5,"My friend got one a few years ago and I took a 2 hour drive in the back seat (I'm 5'8) and was surprisingly comfortable.  The ride was smooth and quiet.  I got tired of driving my big SUV around town so I purchased this vehicle 3 weeks ago.  I find it very fun to drive.  True, the cargo area is small but big enough for a week's worth of groceries.  I'm in animal rescue so I do need a bit of space.  When I fold the seats down, I have plenty of room.  Even the passenger front seat folds flat if I'm driving solo.  I bought the Essence model and love all the bells & whistles.  I find it very comfortable and easy to zip in and out traffic and tight parking spots.  Great sound system too.  So far I love this car!

buick,encore,2019,ANYONE. Loya, 01/24/2020,Best bang for the bucks,5,"I sold hondas and toyotas for 32 years never considered buying a domestic but after driving everything in this class the Encore won hands down for ride ,quietness,price and standard features. Except for the Kia it has the best warranty. Love the way it handles in traffic and the open rd. Buick has stepped its game up for quality. The price was also the lowest with the new GM employee pricing. I would recommend this car to anyone.

buick,encore,2019,Buick owner from now on, 04/18/2020,Love it,5,"Great sub compact car, decent gas mileage, luxury feeling interior, reliable quality. I used to own VW Tiguan, it is junk. Will never buy another VW, from now on Buick is the one I am going to drive!"
buick,encore,2019,Tinman 080, 08/23/2020,Don't believe the magazines,5,"This is a purpose- designed mini luxury SUV. Very sporty, peppy for it's intended use. Very quiet, very solid driving small car. My first imported vehicle at age 70. Having owned lots of GM vehicles over the years icluding a Skylark and a full sized Electra, I can state this is truly a GM-designed and built vehicle. The feel, look and performance will make you comfortable from the start. A looker, it receives positive comments from others.

buick,encore,2019,Mike, 09/27/2020,I own The Buick Encore AWD Preferred,4,"I first owned a Buick Encore FWD and hated it. I went back after about 6 months and bought the AWD and am much happier with the ride. The only thing I would change is getting the Essence with heated leather seats instead of the Preferred and then paying to have the parking and lane change sensors put on while still having cloth seats. The product is nice for the money. I've owned Corvette Z06, Camaro RS, and Mercedes- Benz. So, I am familiar with the high end factor. I definitely feel I got my moneys worth with the Buick. I would not buy the Chevrolet equivelent.

buick,encore,2019,Nicknackr, 10/19/2020,My choice after 14 months of driving new cars,5,"I was moving from a four-door sedan to a first time for me compact SUV. I wanted a new car for a reasonable price (under 19,000). Check.  I wanted good gas mileage. Check. I wanted a power driver's seat. Check. I wanted styled wheels instead of wheel covers. Check. I wanted a car that was driver-friendly concerning steering feel, brakes, ride. Check. I love the leather steering wheel, the ease of setting cruise control, the Sirius XM subscription I pay for makes time in the car enjoyable, and all the side and back windows are uv reducing and the rear and back windows are tinted very dark. Love it! The blue tooth with my phone makes taking and receiving phone calls hands free and easy. The car is surprisingly quiet for a four cylinder. The driver's seat is comfortable and has a lumbar adjustment. The glove box is a good size. With the rear seats down, I have been able to put in what I have needed to bring home. The engine air filter and cabin air filter are a breeze to change - not so the last two cars I owned. Gas mileage in town is 28 mpg plus or minus 1, on the highway 34 mpg. The front windshield defrost vents and air flow are perfect. The only negative I have found in sixteen months and 10,000 miles is there are a few moving speed/transmission combinations where if you call for power in a hurry it takes two-three seconds to arrive. Generally speaking it has plenty of power to zip around town or drive on the interstate. I love this car more than any I have driven in the last fifty years."
buick,envision,2016,-M.B., 07/21/2016,The Crossover with class - Envision,4,"Great luxurious crossover- The vehicle is priced appropriately when compared to other luxury crossovers. Do your homework you will see for yourself. I had test drove the Acura RDX prior to the Envision and found the RDX road height to be a bit low with a very hard ride, stiff sport suspension, not sure if that is ever needed in a crossover/small SUV. So I took a look at the Envision while looking at a Buick/GMC dealer. This Envision fits a void in the Buck SUV lineup. The Enclave is fairly large while the Encore is well yeah, kind of small. I was very impressed by the quiet smooth ride of the Envision along with the interior and exterior styling. On the interior the first thing i noticed was the all digital instrument panel, which makes it feel that much nicer. The interior trim is fitted with leather, i went with black since it is a lease and has a less chance of showing marks even though the beige is beautiful too. The dashboard is also covered in leather this is a nice touch over a plastic one most vehicles have. The front seats seem a little stiffer than i would expect but the heated leather wrapped steering wheel make up for this minor issue. Rear seating is comfortable with separate controlled ventilation for rear passengers. The rear seats can recline ever so slightly and have the ability to glide forward to make more room for cargo in the back. Interior lighting is very well placed with accent lighting on the floor and very eloquently placed lighting on the door panels and front face of dashboard. This looks very nice at night. Exterior lights look very nice with the daytime running LED's on the front and HID headlights and fog lights. Power lift gate is very convenient for loading and unloading. Now the real good part, the power that comes out of that little 4-cyl. is very impressive. I live in Colorado - high elevation and the vehicle has no problem with the thin air and  steep roads. The turbo on the 4-cyl works wonderfully. Lag is in the seconds, like 1-2 maybe. Collision avoidance and lane keeping assist work wonderfully as well. Hard to talk to the reliability right now but so far so good. Really the only downside (reason for not giving this 5 stars) is knowing it is being built in China. Hopefully Buick brings the assembly line for US sold vehicles to the US someday, I guess it is nice to know your employing Americans with your American brand vehicle.

buick,envision,2016,J Wells, 08/23/2017,In for repairs for 45 days no help from GM,4,"2016 Premium 1 has been at the dealership for repairs because of all safety systems faults (Air Bags, ABS, AWD, Power Steering, Stability Control, you name it) for 45 days now. GM Senior Advisor was assigned to my case bu would not answer my phone call or return them. Finally after several attempts to get some answers on getting this problem resolved I had an attorney write a letter to GM stating my states lemon law. Within 2 days my ""Senior Advisor"" found my email address and sent me an update on my case. Only stating that because I involved legal console that she could no longer assist me. Well she haven't been assisting with anything to that point so I'm not sure what changed. Now at 45 days out of service I continue to wait with no other feedback on a resolution.

buick,envision,2016,FloridaMatt, 08/18/2016,"Fully loaded, looks like a bargain",5,"We drove, and just ordered, a Premium II with the Driver Confidence package to get the Full-range Adaptive Cruise Control.  With the panoramic room, the 49k msrp may look steep.  But if you're shopping for a medium-sized luxury SUV/CUV, it's unbeatable for what you get.  We shopped for Suv/Cuv vehicles in its size range that met our requirements of having full-range acc, blis/cross-traffic, and ventilated or cooled seats.  That eliminated Audi & BMW because you can't get one equipped that way.  And ran a similarly equipped GLC300 up to over 55k.    Compared to the NX, GLC and Discovery Sport, we found:  Actually Cooled seats (also on the Discovery), rear seat climate controls, auto-dimming outside mirrors, rain sense wipers that can automatically turn on headlights (which is required in some states; also on Discovery Sport), head-up display (also on NX, $995 on GLC, part of $1800 package on Discovery Sport), passive locking, tire monitor shows actual tire pressures, blind spot detection includes turn signal warning (also on GLC) and closing-vehicle detection (also on Discovery Sport).  Topped off with GM's safety alert seat so things like lane departure and parking sensors can rumble the seat instead of beeping."
buick,envision,2016,Ken Gomes, 11/03/2016,I copied my wife!,5,"My wife picked out the 2016 Envision for herself. We never agree on what to look for in a car. When I went to look at what she was leasing, I was so blown away by the features and quality of the vehicle, 1 week later, I leased one myself! We are a 2 Envision household! The lease value was also a very convincing factor. The monthly  lease cost was similar to vehicles with an MSRP $10,000 less than the Envision. For the 2016 introduction in North America, only the Premium and Premium II trim is available. On next year's model, when the full line of trim options are available, I doubt this ""buyer friendly"" lease situation will be available.

buick,envision,2016,Gary, 01/29/2018,How much more do you need?,5,"I am 75 years old. I have had 6 Buick’s, as well as many other brands over the years.
All of the Buick’s have had all the options available at the time. This care outshines the others cars by a lot. Have owned the car now 20 months. Have not had a single problem at all. I have the premium 1 model no moonroof. Sticker price 43k. This car was cheaper than the Audi with almost all of the same options. The stop start is not a bother at all. The engine restart in less than a second after your foot off the brake. Merging power and highway passing acceleration is more than enough. Cruising at 75 mph is no strain. The best thing of all is how quiet the interior is. There are active white noise speaker on the base of the exit handles on the ceiling. They nullify almost all of the road noise at ear level. Seats are comfortable. All controls easy to reach. Front and side vision better than the Audi. Gas mileage is dead on to what Buick says.

1/30/2019
No longer own the car. Nothing to do with the car itself.
The leasing was running out and we wanted to buy the car. The residual was higher than the retail of the same model cars sitting on the lot for sale with the same mileage. Tried to get GMC to match the deal of the same car same model same mileage for sale on the lot. They would not budge st all. Tried to get the dealer to work out a deal and they said the car belonged to GMC and they had no say.
I dropped the car off at the dealer, paid off the remaining lease and left. This is what you get for remaining loyal to the same dealer for 35 years.
Bought a new car from another maker. It has a better warranty, is a 2018, has more options, is a full size car, sticker price 41K. 
After incentives and a little haggling bought the car for 1000.00 more than I he residual that BUICK wanted for the 2016.
What would you do in this case?

buick,envision,2016,Couldn't be Happier!, 08/25/2016,A Must See and Drive!,5,"We were trying to downsize from our GMC Acadia.  We've leased an Acadia for over 6 years and our youngest just left for college SO our full size SUV needs changed.   We were seriously considering a full size sedan ( Buick Lacrosse or Toyota Avalon) BUT our salesman encouraged us to just take a look at the Envision.  We wanted the moon roof and the navigation upgrade.  This has a great ride and is fun to drive.  It's true we have just taken possession but it fits everything we could ask for in a luxury SUV.

buick,envision,2016,Peter L, 12/21/2016,Start/Stop Nightmare From China,2,"This SUV has many great features; however, they are completely off-set by the horrible aspects. It is the poster child for technology gone amok! The ""start/stop"" is awful! I leased  weather was torrid (90+ every day). It ""shut"" down every time I stopped. The air conditioning stops working and it makes a clunking sound when the engine re-starts. Since the weather has become cold, the start/stop doesn't kick in any more? I enquired at the dealership if this ""feature"" could be shut off which they didn't know which is typical for them. The backlighting on the dashboard and media panels automatically adjusts to changes in the exterior light but doesn't work properly and will dim so much that they are unreadable. This ""feature"" can not be turned off and per the dealership this is a complaint of many owners but Buick does nothing about it. Gas mileage is awful at approx. 18 mpg combined city/highway and I drive conservatively. My previous car was a Buick Verano and I loved it but this vehicle was twice as expensive and I hate it. My last Buick!

buick,envision,2016,Brian Orlando, 11/03/2016,Quality luxury!,5,"I test drove the Acura RDX and Audi Q5 and chose the Premium I AWD 2.0T model of the Buick not only because it had way more technology and safety options for a comparable price but also because the drive, quality and interior design was much better.  This car has far exceeded my expectations and in my opinion is going to be a serious competitor in the luxury compact SUV market.  The turbo engine is powerful and fun to drive.  Loving the interior design and the technology is top notch.  The quality inside and out is also top of the line.  The lane departure assist and all the other safety features are way above the competition especially for the price point.  Buick continues to impress!! Definitely worth a test drive if in the market for a new compact SUV!

buick,envision,2016,Richard Wright, 07/09/2016,Buick lover who needed this size,5,"this car is proving itself to be a perfect, all around vehicle for me. I have owned the car for 18 months now and am very happy with my choice. but the warranty is great and have owned other Buicks with no problems. I love the way the dash is lower so that the visibility out front is outstandingly clear.  The car is very nimble and the steering is better than my previous Buick Enclave. Plenty of punch with this turbo engine, in fact it hardly acts as a four cylinder engine. The technology is greatly upgraded from my previous 2015 Enclave. Extremelythis size is right for us. The interior is of high quality material and well put together as you would expect of a Buick.  If I would find anything on the negative side, it would be the price. The price is too close to the larger Enclave and I expected it to be less, but the intro price was compensated to be fair. After 18 months, this is all still true of this vehicle. We love our Envision.

buick,envision,2016,NormT, 03/14/2017,"Smooth ride, solid inside and out.",5,"Update:  winter driving was a breeze with Twin  Clutch Awd on the stock tires.  The remote start from remote or OnStar app worked like a charm as the car is running when I walk up to it and can take off as soon as I enter.  The heated steering is our favorite feature and very hot.  Seats could be hotter but I only have a 8 mile drive to work.  Next up springtime driving to see some new record fuel economy numbers now that she is well broken in at 15,000 miles.

Update: We are seeing 32 mpg @65 mph for hours on end.  Fully loaded the fuel economy drops to a respectable 30 mpg at the same speed.  Very impressive in this segment to see a 2.0T 4,000 lbs SUV with AWD get into the 30's.  My wife finally got to drive it out of town for business.  She doesn't like all the electrical nanny's but boy does it move on the highway.  Next up...wintertime driving. 9,000 miles now.

Coming from a 2013 and 2014 Cadillac, both of which I still have, the Buick is refreshingly solid and comforting in both riding and driving.  We got a used 2016 Premium ll with roof and Driver Confidence.  Plenty of head room with the sun roof in all seating positions.  The Adaptive Cruise Control along with the self parking feature and lane assist are really neat features. The parking is neat show off feature that this car is very easy to park and see out of.  The lane assist will have you bouncing off each side of the lane for miles, which is a little scary at first.  The ride quality is refined compared to the stiffer, performance oriented Cadillac.   The handling does not take a back seat to the softer suspension that this tracks and takes input better than a rental 2017 Escape we drove 6 hours to pick up the Buick.
"
buick,envision,2016,NormV, 06/04/2017,"Smooth, efficient, with great handling",5,"Update 2: we traded the Envision in on a 2018 Regal TourX.  We like the car-like handling Bose sound system part of the Sights & Sounds package.  And the TourX wagon has the looks that turns heads.

We got $2,500 more than we owed(who says GM's Buick doesn't hold value?!) And $9,000 off on the TourX.

Update: My best mileage is 32 mpg at 65 mph with just me or 30 mpg loaded at thr same speed. 12,000 miles and the oil life is saying it is time for an oil change.  I love the freebies when it is 20°F out otherwise I be in thr unheated garage doing it myself.  I love the heated steering wheel as it get very warm.  The heated seats are appreciated by all four of us and thr heated mirrors work great too.  The AWD is perfect on the white stuff and seldom slips unless you want to punch the throttle. 

With 3,000  miles on our 2016 Envision Prem ll, we picked up used in the mid-$30's,  the moonroof and Driver Confidence Package are quite the deal compared to the more expensive German car companies.  My in-laws are quite smitten with the Envision overall and are considering one for their next purchase. I searched new/used 2.0l turbo for months as it has AWD and torque vectoring included. The 2017 Prem ll discounted was capped my lower models starting at $35K.  So our 2016 Prem ll GM executive driven with 3,000 miles in the next state over was lightly driven with no excessive tire wear, so I know it was not used for closed course driving events.  New 2016 with no options were popping up for $10K off or $33K but I did not want white or silver, so it pays to shop with discounts like that and spend a few hundred to have it shipped.  Currently getting 25 mpg on my half city/highway commute now that it is warming up.  The ride is super quiet and smooth I'm surprised how well it isolates from the road, it is refreshing after a day at work.
"
buick,envision,2017,TomW, 03/30/2017,Sold vehicle after 3 months - Issues,3,"As another reviewer noted, the vehicle has a shake when accelerating from a stop.   It is usually not experienced in a slow/mild acceleration.  But, when turning or straight acceleration on an incline, there is a noticeable shake/shudder while in 1st gear.  The harder the acceleration,  the more severe the shake.  I've even paid to have my local tire store check the tires and balance.  This should not be in a vehicle of this class and price point.  I hope Buick identifies the source of this issue and gets a fix in dealers hands, and proactively notifies owners, before more reviews make note of this apparent defect.  Once you are moving, the Envision's ride and handling is exceptional, quiet and smooth.  For such a soft ride, it is very responsive and does not have cornering body roll.   I love the interior design and materials,  but would prefer slightly softer seats.  The safety features are nice.  I personally do not like the Lane Departure feature and have turned it off.  You find yourself constantly fighting the steering wheel.  The stop/start feature is ok.  But, it should have a couple second delay.  When making parking maneuvers, the engine cuts off on you ... this should have been thought out a bit better.  Overall, it is a nice vehicle at a reasonable price point, but has a few quirks that you should think about.

UPDATE:  I sold the vehicle after 3 months.  I just couldn't stand the engine stop/start feature.  Also, the shaking that I, and others, have mentioned was unresolved by two dealers.  They both said that it is common for the Envision.

buick,envision,2017,MSD, 11/15/2017,Buick Envision Sporty Midsize SUV!,5,"Fell in love with this vehicle after renting the standard model for a week on a business trip. Drive almost any other midsize suv after driving the Envision, and you will really notice the difference. One of the only vehicles, where the engine is not directly mounted to the frame. Very little vibration, quiet, smooth ride for a midsize suv. Handling and braking is great! We leased the Premium 1 with the Turbo. Very lineal torque curve, not a lot of down shifting on the highway. Smooth 6 speed, and no engine noise except when you accelerate. Interior fit and finish is excellent. Highway mileage was 26 mpg on our first highway trip. If the start stop feature bothers you, just shift it into ""L"" and click it to 6. It will cancel out the stop start feature. Very happy with this selection.
"
buick,envision,2017,Rmw, 07/07/2017,Almost Great,4,"Electronics, nav, etc controlled mostly with touch screen. I'd like to have more functions controlled on the steering wheel.  Rear cargo area will not fit golf clubs transversely.  Integration with phones, IOS and Android is excellent, but everything must be controlled via the touchscreen, and this requires taking ones eyes off the road, not too  much different than texting.  The control pad on the right side of the steering wheel controls information screens on the center of the dash, such as gas mileage, next oil change etc.  All of these could be controlled by another means, and the control pad on the steering wheel used to control functions on the touchscreen.  I believe this is a serious flaw in design, and is as dangerous as texting while driving.  

18,000 mile update: Zero service or maintenance issues.   Excellent performance from the 4 cyl engine, excellent gas mileage - 23 mpg mixed.  Love the heated rear seats and rear seat heat/AC vent.  Only negative issues I have identified are inadequate storage in front, and issue described above  with inability to control all infotainment functions without using the touch screen.  I have also noted that the touch screen is more push or tap sensitive than touch.  Mostly light touch will not actuate the function, often needs a firm push or tap.

buick,envision,2017,Dissappointed Owner, 05/06/2017,Last Buick EVER!,3,"Traded an 2015 Encore for the slightly larger 2017 Envision. Loved the Encore's quietness, shifting and general driveability. The Envision has more engine noise, transmission shifts like a 60's powerglide and the autostop is a horrible addition to any car. The little vibration it makes when it starts up is really annoying. Making a left turn from the middle of a busy intersection is very scary when the engine cuts off and you have to hope it restarts. I doubt this car will make it two years in my garage and I seriously doubt that another Buick will ever be in my garage and by the way, I've had at least 3 or 4 previously. Still HATE the auto stop but found that if you shift to L and then use the manual shift button to shift up to 6 then the transmission upshifts and downshifts like any other transmission and the auto stop feature does not work. Worst Buick ever for road noise. Still hate the auto stop/start. Working around that. GM admitted it was a mistake by putting a button in the 2019 cars that disable that feature. The radio comes on every time you start the car. Dealer says that is normal. Very annoying! Transmission still shifts poorly and the road and engine noise is still the same. Looking at 2019 cars like the Forester, and Rav4. Not considering a GM of any kind!

Since then, it's been in and out of the dealership for everything from a noise that is blatantly obvious that comes from somewhere near the gas tank that comes in at certain speeds and has been in for 3 times to try to cure, to a failed operating system. By the way--apparently it takes 7-10 days to get a part for the automobile. If I had to do over, I wouldn't buy that car. For the same money, go buy a Mercedes.

buick,envision,2017,M Berry, 07/29/2017,Great Car with one BIG bug,3,"UPDATE. Now I'm getting a bad smell from the AC ever time I start the car. Went to the dealer and they said to spray AC fresh in to intake duct. What a crop or crap. We only have 8000 miles on the car....This is my last buick....... 
I would give the car 5 stars on everything if it didn't come with one GREAT BIG BUG. Every time you come to a stop the engine stalls and dies. Now there is nothing wrong with the engine because someone at buick though it would be a good idea to shut the engine down every time you come to a stop. They need to kick that guy to the curb. If you test drive the car when it's very hot the AC will keep the engine running when you stop but when the heat lets up the car thinks you only need AC when your moving the darn thing stops running every time you stop. On some GM cars they put a button in so you could deactivate this annoying feature. I realy do think the owner should have the option to take the car in and have the dealer reprogram the computer to deactivate the ENGINE AUTO STOP. If I had knew about this when I test drove the car I would have never bought it. It reminds of my younger days when I had to drive junkers and every time I pulled up to the red light the car would die. Hated it then and realy hate in even more now with a $46000.00 car. BEWARE

I made riding in my Rav4 or CRV seem like I was in a tractor. Typical smooth Buick ride with all the techno upgrades. We have 3 smaller grandchildren and we all love it!!!

buick,envision,2017,Leland, 05/06/2017,Great Value for the features included,5,"I recently purchased the Envision with the Preferred Package. I was looking for a mid-size SUV to go along with the small SUV I purchased a few months ago. The dealership I went to had over $12, 300 in incentives. With my trade in, I was able to upgrade from a 2014 Lincoln MKZ to the Envision. The technology available is the best I've ever had with a vehicle. The ride is classic Buick, smooth and comfortable. I would recommend to anyone considering a mid-size SUV.

buick,envision,2017,Clyde Rodgers, 07/21/2017,Hot Buick SUV,5,"This SUV with Turbo and All Wheel Drive is almost as much fun to drive as my 2015 Regal GS. Handles superb for a 3000 pound plus SUV. This is very nicely appointed vehicle. I like the hands free tailgate operation for when your arms are full of packages or what ever. This vehicle is very quiet at highway speeds. The Bose stereo system is outstanding.

buick,envision,2017,Venice Guy, 03/27/2018,2017 Envision Auto Stop.,3,"2017 Buick Envision. Would not buy this car again. #1 Auto Stop is the worst feature ever put in a car. Terrible. Would pay big bucks to have it disabled. #2 100% made in China. Update this review by stating again how bad the auto stop feature is. It's my wife's car and I won't drive it unless absolutely necessary.  Would trade the car in tomorrow but my wife likes it.

buick,envision,2017,Eric, 05/28/2018,The Essence!,5,"I really like this little SUV / Crossover.  The dealer has let us use this vehicle while our car has been in the shop for the last 1.5 weeks and I'll be a bit sad to let it go.  I looks great on the outside and inside and I can fit my 6ft 3in 215lbs 50 year old frame into the very comfortable, heated, leather, drivers seat just fine with plenty of head room.  It's easy to get out of too and the roomy rear seat area is similar.  Our vehicle comes with heated rear seats and rear HVAC controls.  The interior is nicely equipped with faux wood highlights and panels, the dash knobs and buttons and the instrument cluster gauges seem to be well placed and the infotainment system works great other than sometimes it automatically connects to my iphone and other times it asks to connect.  This might be because the SUV is in demonstration mode... at least this is what the SUV tells me whenever I start it up.  I also like the auto open/close rear hatch.  I can adjust it so it only opens 3/4 or fully.  With it set at 3/4 I can open it in my garage.  It drives very nicely and comfortably and I have good visibility other than the front window posts are a bit thick which looks nice but sometimes can hide an approaching car.  The vehicle is punchy and takes off well when I hit the throttle hard but it obviously doesn't have the 300hp my sedan has.  It brakes well and holds a line well while accelerating, cruising and braking.  It also has the auto start feature.  It's kind of weird coming to a stop at a stop light and feeling the engine stop.  It starts right up quickly so really no complaints there, I just wish it would wait a bit longer before shutting down.  Overall, I really really like this SUV.  It's comfortable, handles nicely, has plenty of comfort features, quiet and seems well made.  That being said, there's only 5k miles on it and I've only had it for a week and a half.

buick,envision,2017,Steve, 04/23/2017,Apple CarPlay A REAL Plus,5,"I traded-in my Lexus NX ... loved the performance ... but CarPlay was not available with aftermarket radios or in a new Lexus (but hear it is ‘coming soon’ to at least some models).  Having CarPlay in the Buick has already (in just the first 2 days) saved on highway toll charges and got me quickly to my destination in a new development 30 miles from home.  I would have eventually gotten to the same location but it would have been a LOT harder to find with the built-in navigation.  

The Buick handling, ride and performance -- comparable to the NX ... has been terrific.  Drove it from VA to FL for a 45 day vacation.  Performance was excellent and gas mileage on the long stretches was amazing.  Coming back I was getting 540 mile range after a fill-up vas normally 410-430 city driving.

buick,envision,2017,Kim, 11/28/2018,We wouldn't buy another one.,3,"We bought the 2017 Buick Envision new for around $45,000. I have only 11,000 miles on it and my tires need replaced for winter! I was told at the dealership when we had it inspected that Buick puts a lower grade tires on them! My friend owns the Encore and she has the same issue with her tires. Plus the AC in the back quit working after a few months. The biggest issue is that the Dealerships can't get parts for these cars! We had a accident with it and it took a little over 3 months to get parts because  the parts come from China! The latest thing is that my dashboard lights are going out while I'm driving it! I also don't care for the engine shutting down every time I stop.  I loved my Buick at first but I would never ever buy another one.

buick,envision,2017,R. Harris, 03/23/2019,"Sorry Buick, never again",2,"This vehicle has been a challenge from the start. Just 2 weeks into ownership, the On-star/infotainment systems crashed requiring a factory reset by the dealer. Shortly after, the rear seat air conditioning did not cool and the dealer had to replace the A/C evaporator case located under  the front instrument panel. The vehicle sat for 3 weeks while we waited for parts but during that time I was in a rental so really no big deal. Until, the rear seat air failed again after just 3 months. This time I continued to drive the vehicle until the same parts were available. The navigation/infotainment/blue-tooth systems are still in conflict. The visibility of the instrument panel/navigation displays are significantly hampered by the strong sun in Florida. Had Buick not removed the windshield tint at the top of the windshield, or fabricated some type of instrument panel shield for the navigation screen, visibility would be greatly enhanced.
"
buick,envision,2017,Bill F. in VA, 06/07/2019,Getting less enthused with this vehicle,3,"We have now had our 2017 Envision Preferred for two years.  We bought it, new, for mainly two reasons:  My wife's aging parents could easily get in and out of the back seat and it was very quiet on the road.  Old-fashioned Buick quiet.  Now, going on year number three, I'm not too happy.   First the good stuff: comfy seats, quiet ride (initially), pretty decent mileage (70% highway, 30% city, av. is 29.8 mpg), and good fit and finish.  My biggest problem is with a service system that is abysmal and that includes the inaccuracy of the auto-reminders one gets from the dealers, even though they can query the vehicle any time they want. .  Experience with two different dealers, one small ""family owned since 1927"" and the other part of a mega-group.  The token oil change and tire rotation stuff they are just fine.  But, actually have some sort of warranty problem that might require a little effort and they don't seem to have clue what to do.  Three problems going on right now - 1) all four passenger doors retain water in a rainstorm or after a car washing. Lots of water.  As much a 2/3 cup per door comes pouring out when the door is opened.  It is a design flaw.  The gasketing covers the drain holes when the door is shut.  Both dealerships think I am being silly and picky and say they can ""find no TSB's""  Must they have a TSB?  This has been a one and a half year debate.  Summertime - musty smell;  wintertime - if there is an above- freezing rainstorm during the day and then a below-freezing night then there's ice rattling in the doors in the morning until it melts.  I'm not being picky.  2) The vehicle just turned over 20k miles.  The tires (Michelin Premier ltx) have gotten really noisy.  We bought this SUV partly for its quiet.  Now it sounds like my old pickup.  I brought this up to one of the dealerships last week.  Diagnosis was that all four tires had ""feathered"" and were wearing unevenly. Fix per the returned invoice was (I kid you not): ""Only fix is to replace tires.  Since tread is still good on tires, advise driving till tires are more worn and then replace them"".    I have written the service advisor asking for some sort of prorated replacement.  I am being ignored.  3) I have seen other reviews mention this.  A rattle somewhere under the floorboard in front.  The interesting part is that it shows up when I fill up the gas tank.  If I only fill it up 3/4 full, no rattle.  Don't have the guts to ask them what they might want to do about that yet.  Oh, I get around the horrible stop/start by driving in manual mode all the time.  Have had no problems with that.  Transmission is sometimes harsh. I have to wonder if Buick is the next one out the door and GM has told them to keep costs at a minimum and the dealer staff just don't care.  I've never been treated with such an attitude before.   If you are  going to consider an Envision, scrutinize the service department heavily first.

I was on my 4th GMC terrain and was not sure about the ride quality compared to the Buick. My dealer has both lines so I test drove the Envision. within 10 minutes of driving it my wife and I were sold. We were retiring and planed to travel some. we have hade this envision about 16 months now. We have put 33,000 miles on it in that time period, our only costs so far have been oil changes and gas, We drove to the East coast and Back through the mountains and running 70-75 with the a/c on and averaged 33.2 MPG..I will replace it next year with another Envision, I want to upgrade to the driver assist features, if you are looking for a great riding mid size SUV I recommend you take a test drive before you buy,

When it was time for a new vehicle we were on the lot looking at the SRX again and my wife saw the Envision and we both decided to test drive it.  Two hours later and thousands of dollars saved, we drove home in the Envision.  One year later and we still like the vehicle a lot Comfortable and it has almost all the luxury features our Cadillac had!  If I had to say anything negative, it would be that it is a just a bit underpowered with the 2.5L compared to the 3.5 in the Caddy.  But that isn't to say it's not peppy or can't easily get from a entry ramp speed of 45 to 75mph in less than 4 seconds.  This was my first Buick and likely not the last."

buick,envision,2018,Ron Consiglio, 06/04/2018,Perception is not always reality,5,"My Buick Envision is an excellent machine. It's major problem is perception. It is supposed to be a luxury SUV, but when most people think of a luxury SUV, they think Cadillac, Lincoln, Acura, BMW,Mercedes or other brands. When I was shopping for an SUV, I went to a GMC dealer looking for a Terrain. The dealer also sold Buicks. I Had never even heard of the Envision. The saleswoman showed a better equipped Envision for much less than the Terrain.  Test driving both vehicles,  I liked the Envision better. Not that the Terrain was bad, but the Buick was a better value, and here lies the problem. Someone looking for a Chevy, Ford or a Japanese or Korean SUV would not even think of a Buick, just like someone wanting a ""luxury "" SUV  would probably overlook a Buick. It seems that Buick SUVS are neither fish nor fowl. So if you are considering an SUV,  give Buick a look and see if there is more value there for you
"
buick,envision,2018,David Gardner, 09/13/2018,I'm Mostly Satisfied,4,"In general, I'm very satisfied with my Buick Envision. It is exactly the right size. It's not too small, but not so large that I sacrifice mileage.  One disappointment I have is the Apple Car Play system is very inconsistent in the way that it operates. It takes a long time to load some of the applications. When you turn them off, they don't stay off, and when you want to launch them, they either don't launch or it takes an inordinate amount of time to launch. This is not Buick's fault, but any technology they install should check out perfectly. The performance is adequate for me. There is obviously slower acceleration with a 2.5 4 cylinder engine. Also, I would like for the interior to be a little less ""plasticy."" Other than those things, I'm relatively satisfied. This is a very good car that is worthy of consideration.

buick,envision,2018,Richard Kell, 09/05/2018,2018 Buick Envision Preferred AWD,5,"We own a 2007 Honda Pilot that now has over 360,000 miles on it.  Still runs and looks great, but we decided it was time to a new car.  Naturally, we thought we would purchase another Pilot, but we really did not need 3rd row seats now.  We test drove the Honda CR-V, it was nice but a little small.  We decided to look at the GMC Terrain.  After the test drive, we were not sold on it.  Parked next to the Terrain was the Buick Envision.  We asked to take that for a test drive.  It is definitely not your grandparent's car.  We loved it.  It handles well and is extremely quiet inside on the highway.  The hardest thing getting used to was the stop/start technology where the engine shuts down when the car is stopped and then starts up again when your foot comes off the brake.  We are extremely happy with our choice.

"
buick,envision,2018,Sam S, 02/19/2019,Owned for 25 months and over 31K with no concerns,5,"If you can get a loaded 2018 still you can get the bargain of the decade.  Back in April when I was car shopping the 2019s were just coming out, but the 2018s were on the lot for $15,000 under list price.  So a loaded $52,000 Envision went for $38,000.  Not cheap, but compared to the competition it was a bargain.  I have the six speed instead of the nine speed, but only lose about 0.5 seconds 0 to 60 and at under 8 seconds, it is plenty powerful enough (7.5 0-60 compared to 6.9 0-60 with the 9 speed).  Gas mileage according to the EPA has not really changed.  The car works with self-parking, all the safety features (lane guidance, automatic braking, etc.), and comfort for all passengers.  Adults and children love the rear seat which you can tilt backwards, heat, have separate AC/heat control, and power outlets.  Not to mention no hump in the middle and plenty of legroom for three full size passengers.  The ride is comfy and the handling is decent.  I drove an BMW X3 and Lexus RX in comparison, and the Buick compared favorably to both.  BMW handles a little better, Lexus is a little more luxurious - but both cost more than $15,000 more than the new 2018 Buick and it is hard to overcome that huge price difference even if they are slightly better.

Update after 20 months and 27K with no concerns
Now I have owned the car closing in on two years and there have been no problems with the vehicle.  All the points from before still hold true.  The dealership surprisingly has a decent service department and for a change, don't force unneeded work on the car - following the schedule as indicated.  Maintenance costs are reasonable and everything is still original equipment but I did replace wiper blades and the cabin air filter myself according to the schedule.  Replacing the cabin air filter is harder on this car than most, but most people won't do that themselves.  Essentially a low trouble, low cost to maintain vehicle approaching 30,000 miles.  Family prefers this car to any other I have owned for long trips, as it is surprisingly comfortable averaging close to 30 mpg on the highways in the northeast.  Still highly recommend this car if you can get a 2018.  Added the technology, reliability, and value ratings now that I have an idea on those categories after extended use.  No problems with Apple Car Play as reported elsewhere, as the controls work very well.  Gas mileage is pretty good considering  right now most of it is suburban with some highway miles added in.

Update after 25 months and 31,900 miles
Not much to add.  Very inexpensive to operate.  Averaging 25 mpg now overall since I bought the car new.  Only 1 mpg less than my ancient 2006 Saab 9-3 I sold when I bought this car and it was front wheel drive with less horsepower.  Family still loves the car for long trips, the wi-fi helps the kids stay entertained if they are not reading.

While I really liked the Encore in many ways, I decided to trade for a 2019 Envision for the larger size and cargo capacity. I find the 2019 Envision superior to the 2017 I previously owned in terms of styling and technology. The envision has the classic Buick classic quiet ride and I find the Envision very easy to drive. My Envision has the 2.5 L engine, which meets my needs for driving and performance. For the cost of the vehicle and features, I find the Envision is very competitive with other mid size SUV/Crossovers.

buick,envision,2019,Nathan, 03/31/2019,"Very Surprised, purchased over CR-V and Tiguan",4,"Firstly, we just bought this Envision and only have 500 miles on it so far, so I cannot comment on reliability, etc.  We had been shopping for an SUV for a couple months and had struggled with the whole 2-row vs 3-row thing.  We decided to get a larger 2-row because my wife will drive it every day and we only road-trip a couple times a year (something a 3-row would be best suited for).  We were set to buy a VW Tiguan because of its size, power, etc.  We visited our local Buick dealer just to see what they had to offer.  We had not even considered the Envision, but when my wife drove the turbo 2.0, the decision became easy: she had to have it!  We were blown away by the ride, smoothness, easy of steering, and the extremely quiet interior.  We also drove one with the 2.5 4-cyl, but it didn't hold a candle to the turbo.  I will say however, that I felt the 2.5 liter was on-par with VW's turbo 2.0.  It made us realize that the VW and the Honda were weak.  This thing has all kinds of power, but it comes at a price.  We averaged 25 mpg (hand calculated) on a 400-mile road trip, with a conservative 71 mph average speed.  Not terrible, but overall worse than others in this class.  This will be my wife's daily-driver, so we'll see how it does in the city.  I'm hopeful the mileage will improve after we get a few thousand miles on it.  Cargo capacity is okay, but we travel lightly so we're good with it.  We had just enough room for us, two small kids, 3 small suitcases, a box of toys, and miscellaneous bags of stuff.  I recently rented a Nissan Murano for a road trip, and this Envision felt just as good, if not better.  The only areas where the Murano was better was mpg and its slightly larger size.  We got the Premium I trim, but even the lower trims are well-equipped with a power lift gate, heated seats, wheel, and more.  The other makes only offer that stuff in high trim levels.  Honda does not even offer two of her must-haves in the CR-V: heated steering wheel and panoramic sunroof.  If you're shopping for a larger 2-row SUV, do not pass up on the Envision.
"
buick,envision,2019,David, 12/31/2018,Loving it so far!,5,"This is a beautiful vehicle inside and out.  It is super quiet and has great road feel for an SUV.  We drove a GMC Terrain as well and were quite surprised by how big a difference there was between these two vehicles.  The Envision feels much more luxurious and has great features for the price.  If you are thinking about a mid-size SUV do not overlook this Buick!  The 2.5L 4-cylinder is slightly underpowered so if you can afford to step up to the Premium trim and acceleration is important to you, you should definitely consider spending the extra money.  However, if acceleration isn't critical and you are mostly driving around town the Essence offers a very luxurious vehicle that handles well and gets good gas mileage.

After 6 months and 9,000 miles, nothing has changed.
"
buick,envision,2019,Clark, 03/26/2019,Underrated and overlooked car,5,"The Envision has a lot going for it. It is comfortable, has controls that are intuitive and easy to use, has sufficient power, quiet, smooth gearbox, plenty of space, and lots of useful tech (power liftgate, blindside assist, rear cross traffic alert, heated steering, remote start, to name a few). All trims come with at least HID headlamps, which makes night driving much better than with halogens. The external design is understated, but by no means unsightly. I can understand why this vehicle doesn’t stand out from the crowd. Edmunds criticism is that this vehicle is too pricey to be a normal SUV, but not luxury enough. For certain segment of buyers, it hits a sweet spot of not too pricey (or as luxurious) as Lexus and Audi, but much more put together than non-luxury SUVs. Unfortunately for Buick, I haven’t seen an Envision on the road where we live (other than us), and that is quite Ok with us. There are plenty of Encores and Enclaves, but don’t see many Envisions out there.

If you want to go full luxury and has the budget for it, skip the Envision, but if you near-luxury with a fair price that falls in line with where they position this vehicle, it could be the right call for you. As a daily driver, this car does almost everything very well."
buick,envision,2019,Heather, 04/02/2019,Don't overlook this car!,5,"I was all set to buy a Volkswagen Tiguan or Honda CRV. The Envision was not even a consideration. Hubby is a GMC guy so we stopped in a dealer. He told them we wanted to see maybe the Envision and a Terrain. I was ""meh"" at best. But then I got in the Envision and was so happy. First I drove the FWD Essence it was nice but didn't have the sunroof. So they showed me the AWD Premium turbo and it was all over. I'm short and The visibility good for me, the power seats are amazing for this also. The outside is understated which I actually like but I don't think it photographs well. So definitely see it in person. The inside is totally glorious. So quiet and comfortable. Luxurious without being obnoxious. It is a powerful ride when I need it, too. The way the engine kicks back on in traffic is completely smooth, I don't even notice. Whereas the Tiguan was jerky and started harder. I usually only drive to get where I have to go. But now I'm finding excuses to go drive anywhere. Gas mileage is better than I expected. Anyway, it's the perfect size for my needs. I am not comfortable driving behemoth vehicles. This is roomy but great for city driving & lugging two kids in car seats. I'm beyond thrilled & so glad hubby took me to look at it. I don't think I'll ever be able to have another plain car.

buick,envision,2019,LCT, 03/15/2019,Smooth 2019 Envision Preferred,4,"I was looking for a small comfortable SUV with all wheel drive, remote start, good climate control, nice smooth and quiet ride at an affordable price.  I found it in the Envision Preferred.  So far so good in terms of meeting my needs.  Only negatives so far are so/so mileage and how the supports block the side view.  I don't drive a great deal so the mileage is not a big issue for me.  The care is much quieter than my previous CX5 and the seats and total ride more comfortable.  Buick was running a great special which meant the car fit my budget.  I even like the bronze color.  It is a little different than all the greys out there.  Give it a try.

It has all the safety features. I wish I had seen this Buick before I bought my 3 row large SUV.  I hope to drive it for a long time.

buick,envision,2019,m. hoy, 04/06/2019,"the good, the bad, the ugly",4,"No car is perfect. This is better than most. Good--surround cameras, heads up, ability to disable the automatic  engine shut off at every stop. The  bad--center console is useless (no smart phone), glove box too shallow. Adaptive features are mixed reviews. The Buick spots the car ahead  at slower speeds and slows down easily. At faster speeds it does not slow down fast enough, need to manually break before it rear ends the other car.  The ugly? Still looking for that!

buick,envision,2019,Jim H, 07/30/2019,Great Vehicle,5,"Leased the Envision 2019 preferred model 3 months ago. Overall the well appointed features and a powerful engine when you need it. Reviewers complain about the heating /cooling vents being to low on the dashboard but I like it the way, you don't need to see them you just got to feel them working. The exterior and interior are very stylish and with modern appealing looks.
I give Buick an A+ and the fact that the whole vehicle was manufactured in China does not surprise me. Love the SUV."
buick,envision,2019,retiredguy, 01/11/2020,Better than I ever expected.,5,"While I loved the way my CTS drove once I got it moving, I was tired of trying to get in and out of my low slung 2013 CTS, and at best, averaging only 16 mpg in town with the 3.0 liter AWD.  Not to mention acceleration was not all that smooth when you hit the gas.  Would rev up, but not start moving for a moment or two.  Decided to starting looking for a crossover like the rest of the world.

Test drove Q5, X3, a small Infiniti (don't remember the model alpha numeric name), Edge, Escape, and next on my list was to look at the Mazda CX5, and Lincoln MKC.  Decided, on a whim, to just take a look at the Envision, just to cross it off the list for possible consideration.

I drove the Preferred FWD.  Liked the ride.  Seats are very comfortable.  Especially like that the head restraints, and lumbar support, both adjust up and down, and fore and aft. Love the outside driver side mirror is auto dimming. Didn't have that on the CTS.  Also, this has the same turning circle as the CTS.

My biggest concern was the 2.5 liter is said to be under powered.  I don't find that at all.  It has better, and smoother acceleration than my CTS had.  However, that may be because when I found out it had a high compression ratio (11.3:1), I began to fill it up with Premium, as the owner manual says to use 87 octane ""or higher"".  I average 20-22 in the suburbs, and easily low 30s on the highway.  My record driving in western Michigan was 36 mpg on the highway. 
Well worth the higher price of premium, which if you buy at Costco, about the same as regular at the corner gas station.

I'm no gear head, but being older, I've always heard that the higher the compression ratio, the higher octane fuel is needed.  Perhaps, and this is just a guess, those that say the 2.5 is under powered are experiencing the electronics reducing the power to restrict knocking that can be caused by using 87 octane.

I don't feel a five star is in order until I get more miles. It is very quiet, decent performance, great gas mileage, and very short turning radius. Ride is smooth, but as indicated, does give some rougher rides over some roads. I wish it was not built in China, but overall, done very nicely. I may purchase when lease is up. Mine is the Essence model. Great leg room for  my 6' 1"" frame.

buick,envision,2019,Scott, 01/19/2020,Never thought about purchasing one before,5,"Handles well, extremely quiet in the city and on the Highway. Interior is much better then any other 5 seater in its class. Touch controls and blue tooth are great. Extras that come with the premium 1 model are just right, very hesitant on getting Premium 2 model with $5,000 extra on price tag. Drove 14 other vehicles in this 5 Seater class of SUV, and this one kept coming up on top. Wife drove it and was more or less sold after the first test drive except for the one we drove did not have a turbo. Once the turbo was driven, the car sold itself. Have had the Envision for 6 months now and the wife loves it, so comfortable with heated steering wheel and heated seats, makes winter temps more comfortable with auto start feature to include auto heating of seats based on outside temps. Sirius XM just like our previous vehicle we owned, but with nice sized touch screen. Was glad we drove all the SUV's in this class and within the same price range for a vehicle that we will keep for years to come. Disappointed they went away from the bronze color in the 2020 model though. Our vehicle and specs were not easy to find in dealerships within the state of North Carolina. Reminder that a turbo is a must if you want the get up and go, r you are just driving a 4 cylinder suv.

buick,lacrosse,2005,GM 3.8 fan, 02/23/2010,Not your father's Buick!,4,"I bought this CXL with the legendary 3.8 engine. It had 37,000 miles and was lightly used. I have driven it 7,000 miles. I love the 3.8 engine and GM got it right with the last of the series. Great around town mileage and good highway mileage. The original tires are about shot and I intend to upgrade with premium rubber. GM needs to put better original tires on its premium models. No problems and my mechanic has raved about the good deal I got from a VW dealer. The car depreciated to where a guy with two kids in college can afford a top line car for the cost of a tin can. My only complaint is that I wish the front leather seats were as nice as the European-style seats on my 1994 Bonneville."
buick,lacrosse,2005,GM Brat, 08/20/2008,First Year Flaws,3,"I have now owned this Buick for 3+ years and have put 75k miles on her. She is still very docile, quiet and well mannered, just what you would expect from a Buick."
buick,lacrosse,2005,Joe S., 06/07/2006,I'm a 45 year old Buick owner,3,"I have had this car for 2 months. Purchased w/15K miles on it. CXL model rides very smooth on the highway. More comfortable than my Saturn L. This car is rated 20/29 mpg but I cannot understand why I only average about 14 mpg in city driving. Highway mpg is great..lives up to its 30 mpg. Steering is a little balky. You can feel it roll and dip on sharp turns. All and all this a comfortable sedan. Looks a little like the Lexus LS330 until you look at the grille. The grille and layout of the front is the thing only way you know it is a Buick. Also, for some reason, every time I turn on the air vents the AC is on. I think if the in city gas mileage was better I would enjoy this car more. "
buick,lacrosse,2005,totally mediocre, 01/27/2009,Totally mediocre,3,"I purchased this car used with 22,000 miles. Initially, I was very impressed with the design of the exterior and the interior materials. However, with time I have been mildly disappointed.  No major complaints, just room for improvement. Like every other review, I am also disappointed with the fuel economy.  Also, the 3.8 liter engine is not nearly as quiet or refined as other reviews suggest. The seats are unsupportive and stiff, although the leather is of very good quality. Have had an ongoing problem with the airbag light coming on for no apparent reason. Finally, the trunk lid has no handle to pull it up. Sounds minor but is very inconvenient."
buick,lacrosse,2005,CXL, 02/10/2006,Better Buick,4,"The 2005 LaCrosse is a much better car than my previous 1997 Buick Regal. Handles and rides much better and doesn't have that old Buick float. It feels more like a sport sedan.  Fit and finish is also improved and it is quite quiet. I think the old 3.8 V6 has been improved. Smoother and quiter. The gas mileage is still a downer. It gets 30 on the highway, but only 17-18 around town.  Overall, its a much improved car."
buick,lacrosse,2005,AmJohn, 01/26/2009,Not dissapointed,4,"Bought this car a year ago and have been very happy overall. Trunk space holds our stroller, a pack and play and still has room for a few bags of groceries. The sound system is very good. Very quiet and comfortable ride, good gas mileage. Only complaint is the intermediary joint is needing serviced or replaced, but other than that I would have no problem buying another one."
buick,lacrosse,2005,Sandra , 04/02/2010,Good car for the money,4,"The car is roomy and comfortable with great trunk space.  Good quality leather - after almost 5 years still looks new.  The only three problems are the low oil pressure warning comes on sometimes - taken to two different dealers who could find nothing wrong - hasn't caused any problems, goes off after a few seconds.  The other issue is the clunking noise that comes from the steering column when I hit bumps. An the last issue is the A/C which I need to have checked because its unreliable - sometimes cold as the arctic going to warm as the desert back to cold as the arctic within a matter of minutes; however, when it does work, it's very cold :)"

Engine cruising rpms are surprisingly low. My new Buick has 1,000 miles on it and I can average 25+ MPG on the interstates of Florida & Georgia while set on cruise control at 75 - 80 MPH. The ABS brakes are very controllable for coming to a smooth, non-diving stop. All-around visibility (windshield, side windows, side mirrors, and a really wide view via the automatic day/night rearview mirror)is the best I've ever had. The rear bumper resident back-up warning system helps give me back some of the sense of depth perception that I've lost with age! I've been in Fords for 30 years. I'm in Buicks to stay."

Also need an alignment and new front brakes. Bellavia Cost 1,992.00. GM offered no help. Went to my trusty car care center and only needed the rack and pinion assembly replaced since it was leaking and an alignment. The steering pump and brakes are good.

After that everything seemed to go wrong with this car almost at once. It's been properly maintained the same as all previous vehicles which lasted 150,000 + miles without problems.

He was aware that the floor is a step down, but did not notice the curve near the rear seat.  The floor that the seat is resting on should be straight, not curved. This could be very dangereous. Not to mention a law suit if someone is really hurt.  I am not sure if GM would fix this problem on MY auto?"
buick,lacrosse,2005,Grandpapaul, 05/04/2016,Not another Buick,2,"My wife wanted a Lacrosse and bought this car 3 years ago with 28K on it. Three months later she bought a Honda Accord and couldn't sell this piece of junk. I had a recall on my Grand Prix and got an email from Buick suggesting I consider a Buick for my next purchase. I replied that I I have an 05 Lacrosse and it junk. After a year of back and forth emails they quit responding. 1. Climate control utilizes air conditioning 100% of the time. I turn it off every time I start it to save gas but it as it comes back on when restarted. 2. Replaced hood struts. 3. Replaced rear window regulator which is rarely used. 4. Drivers mirror quit working. 5. Head lights don't turn off until driving in daylight for an hour. 6. Outside temp takes a couple of miles before going to correct temp. 7. On occasion the engine runs rough. Shut it off and restart and its fine. 8. Dash cracked four times in the first year and looks like varicose veins. 9. Wipers quit so I replace the motor. Poor design as the entire mechanism must come out. 10. When there are riders in the back I can hear the wheel bearings grind. Lots of road noise so I believe most of them need replaced. 11. Rear suspension squeaks. 12. Piece of plastic broke in power seat mechanism. Six ways power seat is now four way.  All these problems in the first two years of ownership. I drive it on occasion and now has 49K. Putting miles on my 01 Grand Prix then will put an estimated $1500 in it when I retire. I am not the type to pass on junk to others so will keep it since it is paid off. 

IF I EVER BUY ANOTHER CAR, IT WONT BE A ""BUICK"". Bring back Pontiac Grand Prixs!

I do like the 3.8L engine. Not sure why they changed. It shifts sooner and RPMs are lower that my older Grand Prix for better gas mileage.

buick,lacrosse,2005,Bud, 05/12/2005,LaCrosse is Very Good,4,"Negatives are few and mostly unimportant: engine is noisy on outside of car;  outside mirrors cannot collapse;  seatbacks recline by lever instead of power;  no tire pressure indicators (bad oversight);  Overall mpg with a 75/25 city/hwy ratio is only 17 mpg (EPA rating is 20- 29).  That's it!  Car is very quiet, has excellent buttoned-down ride, excellent driveability, very good acceleration, esp. at highway speeds and is a pleasure to drive.

buick,lacrosse,2005,Jared Ellars, 03/07/2006,"Love the ride, not that fun to drive",4,"Very comfortable car, smooth ride and quite. Only real gripe that I have with the car is the engine. I've liked the 3.8 in the past, but I think the performance is poor in this car. Could be gearing, but engine seems to run at too low RPMs to effectively change speeds. Engine seems to labor when increasing speed. After it decides to shift down a gear or two, then the performance is there. Mileage is also extremely disappointing. Only get about 25-26 on highway. That is very poor cause my 3.5L (with more horse power) Olds Intrigue got over 30 on highway. City mileage is poor as well in my opinion, I get 18 mpg which includes two miles of stop and go traffic and 8 miles interstate driving."

The tilt lever is hard to locate at times and gets frustrating.  Make sure you put locks on the wheels because mine got stolen.  I also added an additional alarm system because there is no motion sensor on the factory alarm.  Other then these few problems, it is a wonderful car to drive.  Not as smooth riding as the LeSabre but it is sporty and that may be the reason for not having the smooth soft comfort ride.  I do recomend this car and hope to get good service. "

I am a gadget person, this car has just about everthing, yet it is safe and secure, there is less road noise due to the insulation and efforts by GM to keep the noise level down.

buick,lacrosse,2005,William Ray, 05/09/2005,LaCrosse - quiet ride,4,"The Buick LaCrosse has a very good feel for the road without making you think you're in a tight suspension sports car. The quiet ride is the most impressive of any car I have ever driven.  You simply cannot hear other cars going by. The hands-off phone system lets you make phone calls by speaking rather than holding a cell phone to your ear.  Compared to similar models from other companies, the LaCrosse is a bargain in the mid 20 thousand dollar range.  Drive it before you buy a Honda, Toyota, Nissan or Acura."
buick,lacrosse,2005,S.kmetz, 05/19/2005,Buick LaCrosse,4,"I love my LaCrosse.  At this point, I would consider another one when my lease is up.  Don't change the exterior design.  It is beautiful. Would like car designers to take into consideration minor interior changes for the next model year that would add more comfort for a shorter person (5'2). The LaCrosse is geared more to taller people.   See comments below. I love the smooth acceleration and the quiet cabin.  "
buick,lacrosse,2005,John Ginther, 05/20/2005,I like it and I used to drive Park Aves.,4,I love the ride and how quiet this car is in comparison to larger wheel-base cars I have owned in the past.Tight finish. Solid feel Easy handling.
buick,lacrosse,2005,2005 Buick LaCrosse, 05/21/2005,A Joy to Drive,4,"We have about 2000 miles on this new car.  So far we are pleased with it.  On the highway we are getting in perfect conditions around 30 mpg.  In town around 19/20 mpg.  1st new car where we haven't had to go to the dealership for an adjustment for this or that.  Completely happy with it thus far.  Like the driver ""screen"" which tells you EVERYTHING! (MPG, Miles traveled on a trip, how many miles are left before next recommended oil change, etc) :)"
buick,lacrosse,2005,Great Car!!, 06/08/2005,Great Car!!,4,"I traded a 2000 Regal GS for an almost fully equipped CXS Lacrosse. What an improvement in quality, fit and finish. It drives like a German car, not quite as tight as a BMW but that is what I like about American cars, they are like driving your easy chair around!  Off the line performance can't compare to the supercharged Regal. The CXS loses roughly 60ft/lbs of torque from the SC 3800. Sometimes I wonder who makes decisions like this. Once going though, acceleration is nice. The sunroof is extremely dissappointing to me. Air noise is high when open and the worst part is the roof glass goes up over the roof. It doesn't tuck inside the roof like most others! That isn't refinement to me! "
buick,lacrosse,2005,cozumel retreat, 06/16/2005,Great Value,4,"Very comfortable and quiet, I bought the CXL and have been very pleased thus far. Fit and finish is excellent. Great price if you get the Smart Buy rebate (don't forget to pay it off asap if you think you are going to exceed the mileage limits), drive out was $20,450 on a sticker of $28,000."
buick,lacrosse,2005,lance phillips, 06/21/2005,Nice Midsize American Car,4,The Buick LaCrosse is a nice quite midsize car. It has the power to get up and go when you want. The inside design makes the car feel bigger than it is. I moved into the LaCrosse from the Honda Accord and don't miss it at all.
buick,lacrosse,2005,Lane, 06/22/2005,Excellent,4,The ride is superb.  Still has the Buick ride but quiet with a much needed style upgrade.  Definitely a step up. 
buick,lacrosse,2005,Gary Vandervest, 06/21/2005,2005 Buick LaCrosse CXL,4,The car has good pickup and the engine is smooth. I have to look at the tachometer to make sure the idling engine is running. It is a comfortable car and my last two cars were a 1997 Cadillac and a 2001 Olds Aurora. City driving yields 18-19 mpg...may get better. I have not had it on an extended highway trip but expect to get 30 mpg. Have had no problems the first four months.
buick,lacrosse,2005,Daniel Moore, 07/16/2005,Quietest car on the road,5,"I took this vehicle for a 2500 mile trip shortly after purchase and in all of my years of driving I don't believe I have ever had a car that performed better and offered such a pleasant non-tiring drive.  It is interesting that the editors, who don't regularly drive this car don't rate it as highly as do the owners.  I took this vehicle through the Eastern mountains and found it great to handle.  The first day on the road, and this car was not really broken in, I got just under 33 MPG."
buick,lacrosse,2005,CXL 4dr Sedan (3.8L , 07/15/2005,2005 LaCrosse,4,"The car is very good on the road. It has a very quiet interior, and you dont hear road noises. I believe the gas consumption is about 18 to 20 miles in the city, and on the road it is 25 to 27 miles to the gallon. "
buick,lacrosse,2005,thedago, 09/06/2005,LaCrosse is wonderful,4,"This is my 4th Buick. The LaCrosse is everything the advertisements say. I wanted it because of the quiet and smooth ride. Quite an improvement over the Regal. I have had my CXL for 2 months and  i am quite satisfied. I already have over 3700 miles on it. At first I was disappointed in the gas mileage. But after my last road trip encompassing 600 miles I was stasfied. I averaged just under 29 MPG on the highway (which the sticker indicates). However, city driving drops the MPG considerably. I really love the way the car performed in rainy conditions, and the headlamps are nice and bright.Overall I have no complaints. "
buick,lacrosse,2005,sscott1, 09/08/2005,LaCrosse CXS,3,"I bought my LaCrosse three months ago and traded a 99 Regal GSE.  I loved the Regal, but the premium fuel was getting expensive.  I expected to get 23 MPG on the LaCrosse and am getting 19.  I expected a performance hit over the Regal and I got it.  I got 22 MPG with the Regal with EPA rating of 18/26.  The LaCrosse is rated 19/27 on regular gas.  The car is quiet and comfortable with nice features.  I can live with the performance hit, but the mileage is tough to take at $3 per gallon.  Anyone considering a CXS should be aware of what you will be getting on mileage.  So far I have had no warranty issues. This one is my tenth GM car and will be my last.  All in all I should have bought a Toyota!"
buick,lacrosse,2005,Tom , 09/08/2005,This Buick could be better,4,"I really like the interior and exterior styling and the fit and finish are very good.  The ride is smooth and quiet.  However, I drive for work and find the seat very uncomfortable after long rides day after day.  It seems that along the sides of the seats there is not enough cushion to shield the driver from the metal structure beneath.  It has made me think of trading in an otherwise great car earlier than planned. "
buick,lacrosse,2005,DOGONSOFA, 10/04/2005,I should have bought another LeSabre,3,"I have bucket seats and the plastic that wraps around the seat at the bottom is in the wrong place for a short person. Actually it is too thick. If you put your leg next to it, it hurts. So I have to remember to keep my leg stretched out. I am talking on the drivers side, on the left. It is a great car for a young person."
buick,lacrosse,2005,Roy G. Botts, 12/18/2005,Rating our Buick Lacrosse,4,"I bought this car for my wife's birthday. She claims it is a perfect 10 and though I dont drive it very much, I feel it is one of the nicest cars we have ever owned. We have owned new Buicks since 1975."
buick,lacrosse,2005,bob raskin, 09/19/2006,Very happy owner,4,"Effortless driving, smooth transmission. It handles well on curves and at hiway speed. Very quiet inside, zero road noise. No repair issues after 1 year of use"
buick,lacrosse,2005,pat, 10/31/2006,Great Car,5,I had this car 2 hours and I took it on a 6 hour trip and it handled beautifully.  I could not have ask for a better ride.  The car handles will and when you want that extra power it is there.  I travel a lot and I really enjoy driving and riding in the this car.  I have had my car in the mountains out east and it handled very well in the mountains.  It is great on turns and on curvey roads.
buick,lacrosse,2005,Steve Rau, 01/17/2007,"Beautiful, Competent, Comfortable",4,"I am thrilled every day to look at this car in the driveway, especially to hear it running (it has the remote start feature) and get into a cool car on a hot day. Yesterday, I was able to get into a toasty warm car with warm seats, because of the seat heaters that also automatically came on when I pressed the remote start button from inside my house. All the great gadgets work perfectly! I've had the car over 18 months, and have had no problems, despite the wealth of technology."
buick,lacrosse,2005,Jim S., 04/05/2007,Buick LaCrosse is a real winner,4,"The Buick LaCross is the best car Buick has made, I believe. The front looks beautiful, the car is very quiet, the steering is tight, it has a real comfortable ride and cushions, the heater is outstandingly quick to warm up, the base 3.8L engine is very responsive when you tromp it, and I love OnStar hands free calling. This is the most luxury I have seen for the price. Headrests are too large, but they fixed that in later years models. This is the first Buick I have ever owned, and I would buy another LaCross in a heartbeat. I have never heard of a recall on this car, which puts Toyotas and Hondas to shame, in a quality comparison."
buick,lacrosse,2005,Shirley Quinn/David, 05/05/2007,Buick LaCrosse - 2005,4,"Driving this car is good to excellent. Mileage is very poor! It had a recall of the brake, I did not like that. I do not like the locks poping up automatically when the car stops to park. I think that is dangerous. Driver should control that. The exterior receives many compliments. "
buick,lacrosse,2005,Mike, 10/13/2006,'06 LaCrosse problems,4,"Lifter noise on cold A.M. starts. Starter remains engaged with remote start. The leather seats are too firm and extend too far forward, irritating wife's back of her legs. There's a rubbing sound when backing up out of garage/wheels turned to left. Too many push buttons on dash in proximity to others. Cheap floor mats. Had wipers replaced twice, kept bending in half."
buick,lacrosse,2005,Rodger B, 07/13/2008,Better than expected,4,"This is our first Buick. We had a 2001 Aurora before this. We have driven this car about 38000 miles now. Car is very quiet and handles great. Ride is very smooth. City gas mileage is 19-20 mpg, highway is 30-32 mpg. Like everyone else these days, I would like more mpg but this is better than most cars of this size. Have not needed any repairs except a battery replacement which is normal in southern Arizona. I'm disapointed that there is no tire pressure monitor system on this car, Buick sure missed the boat there. This was corrected in 2006. I do wish this car had a memory system for the seat and mirror settings. Over all, my wife and I both love this car. "
buick,lacrosse,2005,Big Ed, 11/09/2005,Bad Choice,4,"Never owned a Buick before and after reviewing other cars in this class,I thought this was a good choice.  Initially I liked this car very much. I noticed the problem on the first trip of about 150 miles. At highway speeds of 50-65 MPH and trying to maintain a safe distance from the car in front of me. The accelerator pedal seems to have a dead zone. It doesn't respond under normal foot pressure to maintain the speed that traffic flow allowes. As I apply a slight pressure on the gas pedal, nothing happens. As I increase the pressure, a sudden burst of acceleration is felt with the teck jumping 500-750RPM. This unusual condition is very strenuous on long trips of this constant awareness.   "
buick,lacrosse,2005,garyjerjay, 09/21/2005,Love this car!,4,"I am past my ""beat the other guy off the line"" days but I wanted a car that had decent acceleration and one that did not ride like the old Buick floating ride, but rather one that had a smooth quiet ride, and one that you could also feel the road under you and was firm in the corners.  My Lacrosse after 3,500 is all that I wanted and more.  No, the accereration does not snap your neck back but is more than adequate.  The cabin is incredibly quiet and the power seats are very comfortable.  There is enough room in the trunk for four sets of golf clubs and there is room in the cabin for four adults although the back seat could use a little more room.  This is a great car for this old baby boomer!"
buick,lacrosse,2005,freeh, 11/13/2005,2005 LaCrosse CXL,4,"Nice car. Good ride and handling. Excellent on the highway. Only drawbacks are fairly poor mileage in town and somewhat tight rear seat. Much better car than my previous Buick, a Regal."
buick,lacrosse,2005,Kevin, 01/30/2006,American cars on the comeback trail,4,"If you fancy yourself as an educated buyer, do yourself a favor.  Don't overlook this vehicle.  Even the most hardened Camry or Accord fan can appreciate and buy this car.  I know, I was one of them.  It's the best car I've owned.  Go drive one and see for yourself."
buick,lacrosse,2005,Won't buy again, 11/18/2007,Won't Buy Again,4,"This automobile has been rattletrap on city streets since I bought it (freeways no problem) Disappointing mileage, good handling. Comfortable to drive, good climate control, lousy floormats.  Inability to fix rattles will cause me to buy a Mercury or Lincoln next time."
buick,lacrosse,2005,Melvin Law, 02/19/2017,Best car I have ever driven,5,"I would be afraid to buy a well maintained Buick like this even if it's 12 years old.
"
buick,lacrosse,2005,Donna, 06/23/2006,Not toohappy,2,"I previously owned a Buick Century and was very upset when I found out they stopped making them. I bought the LaCrosse because I was told it was the replacement for the Century. I have not been impressed. I do like the car, but only at this point because it is a new car, and who does not like a new car. I had very good luck with the Century as far as engine problems went. I was told that the LaCross has a new engine design and I am quite sceptical about that. It does not seem to have the power that the Century had. I have very slow acceleration when I am running my air, and the air conditioning is no where near the performance that the Century had.I am not happy about that. I am disappointed"
buick,lacrosse,2005,jim vollmer, 12/16/2004,Impressed by the LaCrosse,4,"   I have previously owned a 2002 Buick Century and before that a 1999 Olds Cutlass.  I have found the LaCrosse to be a decided upgrade.  The 3.8 liter engine is superior to the 3.1 (although not the gas mileage), the ride is firm, ultra-quiet, and luxurious.  The sound system is superior to either of the previous two cars, and the interior amenities far better.     In addition, people have commented as to how stylish the car looks, which never happened with the Century (""stodgy"" was the word).    Within 1000 miles, I have already recorded 29 mpg twice on trips of over 100 miles.    The doors fit ""tight.""  I hope the vehicle doesn't depreciate like older Buicks are known to do.    "
buick,lacrosse,2005,Mark R, 03/31/2005,Not an old mans car anymore,4,"I bought the car two weeks ago and have put on 1200 miles- mostly highway and Illinois tollway in Chicago area. Averaging 26 mpg with avg speed of 48mph. Looks great, runs great, best value for the money so far. I have had Bonnevilles, a Seville and a Saab and this is the best of the lot. "
buick,lacrosse,2005,Gary, 05/17/2006,Gas Poor,4,"Have had for 1 year and 9,500 miles.  Just minor irritances i.e. squeak in dash, wind noise.  Car handles well on curves and accelerates without hestitation.   (and wife) don't like consoles so are trading car in new Buick Lucerne with split front seats for eatra room and longer arm rest."
buick,lacrosse,2005,Scott, 07/25/2006,Still Mixed Feelings,4,I have owned my LaCrosse CXS for a year now and like it but have a few issues. My wife really likes it and drives it daily.  Fuel mileage is less then expected.  With mostly town driving we get 19mpg. Power is great. Transmission is not a smooth as others in this class. Truck is difficult to open.  Two issues - drivers side window rattles at high speed and CD player rattles when hit bumpy roads. I like the car but Buick needs to work out some details in design and quality.
buick,lacrosse,2005,Horkee, 12/17/2004,Tried foreign definitely back with U. S.,4,"First, I don't believe in 10's.  
I compared the car to the 300 Chrysler 
Limited, 300 series BMW, and 330 
Lexus.  We drove all of them including 
the Acura TL (snakey handling in the 
wet when pushed).  All are nice cars. 
but for the money this was the winner 
ahead of the Chrysler. 
The Lexus is O. K. but it's a dog, 
requires premium fuel, and doesn't  
handle that well. The interior is nice, 
but uses an egg shell finish on 
everything to hide the flaws. It's 
really expensive for what you get...or 
don't get.  
We traded an ex v-6 Honda and my wife 
is the one who will drive it most.  She 
liked the performance over the looks of 
the Chrysler and I agree. "
buick,lacrosse,2005,Mike, 07/16/2005,My old Century had a softer ride and seats,4,"I really shopped and already have an '04 buick century.. The LaCrosse is only slightly quieter, mainly the engine, but tire noise is there. Also the seats are not as comfortable as the Century and the ride seems stiffer... Power in the LaCrosse is smoother and more responsive, and fully loaded on vacation to Florida we got 28 MPG. If the Century is replaced, then the LaCrosse may take its place, but ride quality and seats are an area for improvement...  "
buick,lacrosse,2005,justy, 08/20/2005,I love my LaCrosse-Fantastic Value,4,"I bought my LaCrosse a few months ago and I really like it a lot. I traded in a small SUV because I really wanted the comfort of a sedan again. I am 38, but and in a professional line of work, so I wanted to buy a car that is classy.  This car fits the bill! It is absolutely beautiful inside. The wood grain is what sold me (yes, I know it's not real-but I like it). The thing I am most disappointed in the handling. The steering has some play and I think it needs to be tighter. I agree with others that the trunk is awkward to close. I wish I bought a higher trim level but it's still a great value."
buick,lacrosse,2005,Norman Kairns, 09/12/2006,First ever Buick,4,"Been a GM person most of my driving life, and this is the first Buick I've owned. Nice car. Clean finish and very comfortable to drive. However, the car could use a little more head room in all seating positions. "
buick,lacrosse,2005,neshapop, 01/17/2007,18K later,4,"Here is my feedback after 18 K mi./28K km. So far the car was problem free, had bearing assembly replaced a few weeks after the purchase but it was a minor issue. Great fuel economy on the highway but a bit thirsty in the city. Great ride and build quality, very satisfied with the vehicle. Outstanding value for the money.  "
buick,lacrosse,2005,Chuck, 12/02/2004,My First Buick,4,"I've had my black/black CXS just over two weeks and am mostly happy.  The car has just about all of the options.  It offers a very smooth ride, and a very quiet interior.  Unfortunately, the airbag light is now going on and off, so it's back to the dealer (already) for service."
buick,lacrosse,2005,Marie Foy, 12/21/2004,My new Buick,4,"Very good fun car to drive, nice and quiet and this is really good."
buick,lacrosse,2005,Miley, 12/16/2004,Great Car,4,"I think I've heard it before, but it is not your father's Buick! The ride and handling are great. It's extremely quiet. My only knock would be not being able to purchase the 3.8L engine on the CXS model. The 3.8L was plenty of engine for my '01 LeSabre (for me) and got great mileage for a large car. If the LaCrosse holds up, it will be my best car so far."

The heated leather seats are great in cold weather and I love having On-star ""just in case"" of an emergency.  The 3.8 liter engine has great pickup on the highway and gives you a quiet, comfortable, and smooth ride, even over snow crusted roads.  This vehicle is superbly engineered and has too many features to mention here.  I just love my new LaCrosse, and would recommend it to anyone with a small family or a businessman who travels frequently.  This vehicle would stand up to any Mercedes or BMW as far as I'm concerned, and it's American made!"
buick,lacrosse,2005,alydar, 01/08/2005,LaCrosse CX,4,i haven't had this car long but the most impressive thing is the quiet tuning. The lack of road noise and solid feel of my CX  have made my work commute very relaxing.
buick,lacrosse,2005,david cowan, 01/29/2005,I should have got a Century,3,I have a CX LaCrosse model.  The A/C light comes on every time I start it and must be shut off manually even when it is 30 degrees outside..  Seats are slab type and not as comfortable as the Century...  Buick forgot their market is people that want a smooth ride and leave the stiff ride to pontiac etc.  I test drove the Ford 500 and others in price range and found them just as quiet and smoother ride..  Driver shoulder room tight due to overly large door panel thickness..   Bought the LaCrosse out of loyalty and not logic..   
buick,lacrosse,2005,MartyD, 02/01/2005,My first US car in 18 years,5,Nice looking design inside and out. Looks more expensive than it is.  Handling on par with my 2000 Nissan Maxima which is pretty good.  Bigger trunk than Acura TL.
buick,lacrosse,2005,Christopher Z., 03/17/2005,The LaCrosse is top-notch,5,"I used to drive a Cadillac and missed the ""big car"" ride when it got old and I had to trade it. I was looking for a less-expensive alternative to a Caddy, but I still wanted the ride and features of a luxury car. Buick has done it! This car has even more features than my Cadillac with that ""floaty"" big car ride. It gets better mileage and I didn't have to sacrifice much interior room. The insurance rates are much lower and the car is very modern-looking, strikingly beautiful in my opnion. "
buick,lacrosse,2005,teesie, 03/29/2005,Driving in Excellence,5,It is a joy to own and drive this car. I love it.  I love the way it looks inside and out and I love the way it feels behind the wheel. I would definitely reccommend it to everyone.
buick,lacrosse,2005,JoeZip, 05/28/2005,My LaCrosse CXS,4,I have enjoyed driving this car on several long trips. It is comfortable and doesn't tire me when driving for several hours.
buick,lacrosse,2005,Epr7339, 06/10/2005,LaCrosse,3,I am a 19 year old male. This is the 2nd Buick that I have owned. The car is just alright. I think that the mileage is really bad!  I dont find the seats to be good on long trips. The car never shifts right when going down hills. It feels like it is up shifting and down shifting on its own. The dealer told me that they did a software update on it to fix it. The fix works most of the time. If I had to do it all over I would not buy this car. This car is nice in a lot of way but also needs work in a a lot of areas as well. 
buick,lacrosse,2005,milford jensen, 06/24/2005,Poor Handling,2,I find this car has poor handling on the highway at speed limits. It wanders from left to right and I have to correct the direction all the time to keep it on the road.It will not stay on center or netural position. It is very hard to enjoy driving this car. I also feel that it is not a safe car and could cause a accident. This car has had the alignment checked twice and set to specs.The dealer says they are all like this and can't do anything about.If you are considering buying one of these make sure you drive it on the main highway at speed limits and check to see if it tracks without wandering.
buick,lacrosse,2005,Jennifer McGinn, 06/29/2005,My Buick La Crosse,5,"I am enjoying driving this car - the fourth Buick I have had and it is far superior to the 3 Regals I had before. Road quietness, comfort and ease of operation are just some of its outstanding qualities."
buick,lacrosse,2005,RoccoM, 07/07/2005,Buick LaCrosse,3,"The steering takes a little getting used to after driving for many years with power steering. The panel lighting is great, and the automatic lights on/off function is welcomed. I like the safety feature of the daytime running lights. A year of free OnStar is enough to get me to pay for it when it comes up for renewal even though it is rather expensive. Fuel economy could be better as could the rear seat room which is very tight especially in terms of head room. All in all a very good card with a great appearance (especially in cardinal red metallic)."
buick,lacrosse,2005,John Beach, 07/09/2005,LaCrosse vs Ford 500,5,"This car reminds me of the Olds Aurora in design. The quaility of workmanship is fantastic.It's very comfortable to drive, with effortless steering and smooth acceleration. Great radio sound. We made a wise choice with the LaCrosse over the Ford 500, which is under powered."
buick,lacrosse,2005,John Henry Doakes, 08/12/2005,Car of the Year,4,"I'm disappointed in mileage, in town and on the road.  Car has not loosened up yet, but hope it will do better than 16 mph."
buick,lacrosse,2005,BadgerBuick, 08/12/2005,A New Kind of Buick,4,"An outstanding vehicle in performance, quality and styling.  The CSX model is a Buick that should appeal to all kinds of drivers.  Young people that drove mine loved it and wished that they could have one.  Buick has to change the focus of its advertising, stressing the performance and styling of the LaCrosse.  It looks a lot better than the Honda, Nissan and Toyota ""luxury"" clones.  These all look alike, exterior and interior.  There seems to be more of a difference between owner and ""expert"" evaluations for the LaCrosse than for most other cars.  Owners love it, ""experts"" rate it so-so.  The experts must have an image of the ""average age of 65"" Buick owner embedded in their mind.  "
buick,lacrosse,2005,Ron , 09/26/2005,05 Buick Lacross,4,"Overall ride and comfort has been very good. Whisper quiet, comfortable on long trips, firm suportive seats. I purchased the bucket seats as the bench seat has a dumb looking fold out center console. Controls well placed. Car had a brake pulsation caused from warped brake rotors. Car was fixed but when I picked the car up in a rainstorm found passenger side flooded with water. Had to bring car back twice to have leak fixed. Was not a happy person! That was unacceptable to me as build quality should have been better. Overall since that time all has been good with no other issues. Hope it stays that way. The interior (Tan) is what I bought needs to be darker to show less dirt. Good value overall."

buick,lacrosse,2005,caddycart, 06/15/2006,2005 LaCrosse CXS,4,Have owned this car for one year and Ilove it.  Would like  it better if it got a little better gas mileage but I do like the new engine.  Would also like mine to have the new 4 year warranty.
buick,lacrosse,2005,Tyler, 12/08/2004,Buick Lacrosse,5,"Switching from a Regal GS to this 
vehicle was like night and day.  The 
car is incredibly smooth and has great 
handling.  The seats are very 
comfortable, much more than the Regal's 
which got uncomfortable after long 
trips. The one thing that stands out 
the most to me is the quietness of the 
car.  I just wish they would have given 
the car a little bit more power but I 
can never have enough power."
buick,lacrosse,2005,Philip T Behm, 12/12/2004,Buick Convert,4,"First GM product in 35 years. Opted 
for a fully-equiped CSX. Impressed 
with comfort, quietness, great ride, 
with great handling. All controls easy 
to use. Fit and finish is exceptional. 
Got 3 months free XM radio. Did not 
really think I would use it, but it is 
AWESOME! Good power with 240 hp 3.6 
VVT motor, but hope highway mileage 
improves. Great quality car 
and I feel good about buying an 
American car again with."
buick,lacrosse,2005,AMERICAN, 12/16/2004,American style and quality,5,"The Buick LaCrosse is a great driving 
car.  No other vehicle can match the 
quality and feel of the vehicle for the 
price.  It's the most quiet car I have 
ever had.  I'm 35 and think it's a car 
with style and it's American."
buick,lacrosse,2005,Art, 12/19/2004,Good value,4,"My LaCrosse CXL has real curb 
appeal and nice features such as the 
telescoping stearing wheel. It's  very 
comfortable on the open road, 
although gas mileage is not as good 
as the LeSabre I traded in for it. The 
brakes are very good but 
acceleration is just ok. I wish GM had 
made the larger engine standard. 
The standard radio sounds 
surprisingly good and adjusts  
volume as you increase speed. Neat."
buick,lacrosse,2005,GW Cooper, 12/28/2004,Buick Scores a Hat Trick,5,"LaCrosse (Allure in Canada)is an 
endless delight. Beautiful, well 
proportioned exterior and sumptuous 
interior with excellent ergonomics 
combine to create a refined driving 
experience. Form, fit and finish are 
well integrated to create a unity of 
purpose that is first class. Powertrain 
performance is superior and seemless. 
Flat torque curve, smart safety 
features, agile suspension system 
together instill confidence in treating 
the CXS as a true sports sedan. Quiet 
tuning and a superb sound system 
combine to offer distortion-free sound 
studio quality and listening pleasure 
be it jazz (Diana Kroll), classics (  
Vivaldi's Four Seasons with Perleman), 
folk-rock (the Eagles, Beatles, Pink 
Floyd."

buick's going. I have driven it 1500 
miles with no noise, very smooth 
handleing. Quiet cabin. Nice leather 
interior.
 It should have ABS brakes std. on the 
CXL Model.
Lots of good passing power. YA  YA"

 quiet.

buick,lacrosse,2005,DAN M., 02/05/2005,Love the new LaCrosse,4,"This is what I have waited for in a vehicle. It is so good looking and stylish, and it handles so well that I can't wait to drive it. It really has all the features that I wanted in a vehicle, plus the Buick quality that makes it not your Grandfather's Buick, but today's Buick that is for every generation. Way to go, Buick! You've outdone yourselves on this one."
buick,lacrosse,2005,Mike Hamburg, 02/19/2005,2005 Buick Lacrosse,5,"A great addition to the Buick line. It's something Buick should have done a long time ago. It's not my father's Buick. It's roomy, stylish, very ecomical, quiet,smooth riding, comfortable, and a real joy to drive. The cushiony ride and quietness of the road was what sold me the first time I drove a Lacrosse. Drive one you will love it."
buick,lacrosse,2005,BIll Richardson, 02/19/2005,LaCrosse - Best automobile on the road,5,"I purchased this Buick LaCrosse in late January, I have just returned from a 3500 mile trip back to the east coast. Driving this car is like sitting in your easy chair at home and watching the world go by. The ease of handling this car is far in the future of most other cars. This is the best automobile I have purchased in 55 years. If you drive one you will buy it. I know I did."

buick,lacrosse,2005,Pat Manzo, 02/21/2005,Wonderful Car,5,"This car is a dream to drive. The CXS model combines refinement and power to a top-notch level. Critiques on only having a 4-speed transmission, lack of an automatic seat lever, and a navigation option seem annoyingly demeaning to a superbly manufactured automobile."
buick,lacrosse,2005,L and V Leonard, 02/23/2005,We like it!,4,"Having done a lot of homework, looking for a new car, we settled on the Buick LaCrosse.  We have taken two road trips in it thus far and are extremely happy with the car.  The LaCrosse takes Buick out of the ""AARP bracket,"" although that's not a bad place to be!"
buick,lacrosse,2005,dmn, 03/11/2005,My LaCrosse,5,"I purchased this vehicle last November and drove it from New York to Florida for the holidays.  This vehicle is comfortable, quiet and I got around 26 miles to the gallon.  That's pretty good for a brand new vehicle."
buick,lacrosse,2005,Don Boone, 03/16/2005,Best Bang for Our Bucks,4,"After owning several GM cars, including a 99 Regal LS, the CXS is all I hoped it would be. Worth the money, especially as we compared it to more expensive vehicles. Drove from upstate NY to Florida one week after purchase, and loved the smooth ride, acceleration, quiet, handling, roominess, trunk space, and what a great 6 CD Concept III sound system!  The exterior style and finish (Glacier Blue) are terrific.  Leather seats w/ heater provided comfort even for the one 12 hour driving day.  Temp system is big improvement over Regal.  Safety, reliability and great style big plusses. We looked at other competitors (Mercury Montego, Saab, Honda) and know the CXS has them all beat.    "
buick,lacrosse,2005,tjayf, 03/19/2005,Best Buick since the Park Avenue,5,I really enjoyed driving this new Buick. It is really quiet and very responsive.  I like it better than the Park Avenue I traded in.
buick,lacrosse,2005,E Nelson, 03/22/2005,2005 Buick LaCrosse,4,"We just recently purchased the LaCrosse.  less than 1,000 miles on it at this point, but so far we are pleased.  It seems to be quieter than our 2000 Regal.  Steering and braking is more responsive.  The beige interior could be too light and harder to keep clean.  This is the first new car that we purchased where we didn't immediately have to have something adjusted or taken care of at the dealership.  Quality control seems to be good on this one.  "
buick,lacrosse,2005,marty ambrosecchia, 03/23/2005,Looking for luxury,4,"If  you are looking for luxury at a low price this is your car. Car has avery soft ride and is roomy inside. Soft leather seats, good sound system, and it gives you a big car feel. The only drawback is the 3.8 V6 engine.could use more power, although some people might like it that way."
buick,lacrosse,2005,Jeanne Leix, 04/01/2005,My LaCrosse,4,"This car has been fun, comfortable, and easy to learn how to drive.  The seats are great.  We drove to Florida and back with no discomfort at all.  It handled the road like a charm.  We got between 29 and 33 miles per gallon.  I just love it."
buick,lacrosse,2005,dino, 04/23/2005,Not anything like my Regals!,2,Missing many of the standards on past Buicks. They have cut corners on everything. Will consider Japanese car next purchase.
buick,lacrosse,2005,bowlerman, 05/10/2005,I like the car,4,The auto rides very smooth and quiet. It is very comfortable to sit in and drive. I do not like the insert for ignition key. It is hidden. It has plenty of room for all to sit in.
buick,lacrosse,2005,Bill T., 05/22/2005,Base LaCrosse CX,4,"Great car--quiet, responsive even with base engine, reasonable gas mileage averaging 25 mpg in city/highway driving.  Interior treatments give effect of more expensive vehicle.  Basic plastic wheel covers needs to be improved since noise is evident when windows open.  Headroom is tight, otherwise interior dimensions are more than adequate.  Rear end is not in character with Buick.  Needs taillight treatment across entire rearend as in recent Centurys, Regals, LeSabres. Right now, the rear looks too much like a Taurus.  ABS/Traction Control needs to be standard on a car of this caliber (GM is including it on 2006 models).  Recall is in effect but no dealers have parts to make repairs."
buick,lacrosse,2005,Orman Surina, 06/16/2005,One Very Fine Car,5,"We are extremely pleased with our new LaCrosse.The cabin is whisper quiet, handling is precise, body and interior fit is excellent. All controls on the dash are well placed and easy to operate. Buick is going world class!"
buick,lacrosse,2005,rwisem, 07/01/2005,Smooth and powerful,4,This is the best Buick I have driven.  The build quality is world class and the ride and handling are the best yet for a GM mid-size.

Controls are well placed and easy to use (No tiny buttons to try and find). Seating position is comfortable..thanks to a telescoping steering column.  And quiet.....so quiet."
buick,lacrosse,2005,Donn, 08/08/2005,D's review,4,I love this new car. The only item with a problem was a brake sensor recall.  I am not completely satisfied as the brakes still seem to grab and are not as smooth as I would like although they do stop well.
buick,lacrosse,2005,N. Popovic, 08/10/2005,Our Allure CX,5,"Great value, design and style, evolution and improvement comparing to earlier Buicks. Being 37, I found this one much more appealing to younger drivers but still with the famous smooth ride and Buick quality and reliability. Superb ride and build quality, style, quietness and handling, car has enough power with good old 3.8L engine and expected fuel economy and better brakes and suspension. Long story short - really great car!"
buick,lacrosse,2005,dago, 08/20/2005,Buick finally got it right,4,"This is my 4th Buick and by far the best. I was really disappointed in my 03 Regal. The bumpy ride and  exterior  noise was a turnoff. After reading about all the changes Buick made for improvements I just had to try out this LaCrosse. The ride is so much smoother and very quiet. My only regret is that I didn't get the CXS model. I have had the vehicle only 2 months so it is difficult to rate the reliability, hence the low mark for reliability "
buick,lacrosse,2005,Joni Glessner, 09/03/2005,Short term owner so far,4,"Love the car - traded in a 2004 Rendevous - hated that one. Big trunk, OnStar, remote start, XM Radio big plus.Gas mileage still on the bubble - have only gone 400 miles. Beautiful car - Been a Park Ave. owner for years UNTIL the Rendevous. LaCrosse is perfect size. I'm a 25 year REALTOR so need a nice roomy car. LaCrosse meets the criteria so far!!"
buick,lacrosse,2005,DADIRV, 09/08/2005,Disappointed,3,Lags when accelerating from one lane to another on the highway. Jars the teeth when riding over light road irregularities. Creeps when waiting for traffic lights to change. Mpg is poor. On the road without city driving may be 21 mpg. City driving gives me 15-16 mpg. My 93 Buick Park Ave gave me better mileage on the road. The thermometer inside reads wrong all the time. I would guess that there is some sort of electronic problem.
buick,lacrosse,2005,SDS, 09/07/2005,2005 Buick LaCrosse,4,"Excellent value.  Outstanding handling and pickup.  Looks classy, yet sporty. Can't beat it for the money.  LOVE IT!"

buick,lacrosse,2005,Steve, 09/19/2005,Nice car!,4,This car rides and drives like a Lexus.  Buick has outdone itself with the development.  Cab comfort is well recieved.  I commute a good distance every day and driving this car makes it much easier.
buick,lacrosse,2005,sscott1, 11/13/2005,LaCrosse CXS mileage,3,"I've had my Lacrosse for about six months now.  It is quieter than my 99 Regal was and the ride is smoother.  The interior comfort is about the same.  My major complaint is gas mileage.  It is getting 19.6 average for combined city and highway driving (about 50/50).  My 99 Regal with the SC3800 engine got 22-23 mpg.  Same driver, same route, different car. I've seen comments about the performance of the 3.6L engine in the CXS, but my experience is performance is nothing to get excited about.  It's better than the 3.8L, but a long way from my 99 Regal GSE."
buick,lacrosse,2005,Richie A, 12/05/2005,Love Long Drives,4,"Car rides very nice but tends to drift a little. Very comfortable on long rides. I just put in a a wood dash kit to finish the look of the radio ,and air control now the look is classy. Buick should offer this upgrade...I'm now looking for a aftermarket grille"
buick,lacrosse,2005,Biloxigirl, 03/06/2006,Fun to Drive,5,Fun car to drive.  Love the remote start feature -- was sold first time saw it.  Great stero and XM and daughter loves the dual climate control.  Quiet smooth ride.  Real upscale car for the price. 
buick,lacrosse,2005,joe kuroski, 03/22/2006,My First Buick,4,"I was waiting for Buick to come up with an all new car, to replace their dated 80's style line up. I was very pleased with the pleasent design, inside and out. I have the CXS model,v-6, It goes like the wind. I have experenced 2 recalls and the heater fan module breaking. But all and all the quality is impressive, and the quietness inside the cabin is wonderful.      "
buick,lacrosse,2005,James Lorenz, 03/22/2006,Another Good Buick....but,3,"I am pleased with my Lacrosse except for local gas mileage.  On the highway (trips) it gets over 30+ mpg, but around home only about 12-14 mpg. My old Century did far better than that. Also, the headrests are not angled forward like the old Century. I feel they should be touching the neck and head without having to lean your head back.  Ride and performance are as good as my Century.  The Lacrosse has some creaks and groans that I will be telling the dealer about at my next checkup."
buick,lacrosse,2005,BearSgt, 09/14/2006,Love my Buick,4,"Had my LaCrosse now for a bit over one year.   The only problems associated with this vehicle are the rotors and wheel bearings. Only have 14,000 miles on it and had to have 3 rotors and wheel bearings replaced.   It needs to get better gas mileage and a handle to assist in opening the trunk.  Otherwise, I love the car.  It's very quiet and has a smooth ride."
buick,lacrosse,2005,Randi, 12/29/2006,Car review,5,"This car drives very smoothly over any bump in the road.  It's great with gas.  Turns very nicely, the brakes work great and it has great pick up."
buick,lacrosse,2005,maddog55, 04/18/2007,2005 LaCrosse,4,Zero problems. Only back to dealer for routine maintenance. I would highly recommend this car. It rides a lot bigger than it actually is.
buick,lacrosse,2005,Andrea Deyo, 02/12/2018,13yrs & still going strong!,5,"Love my 2005 Buick Lacrosse.  Bought it new a little over 13yrs ago, its got 101,400 miles on it & it still drives well.  No real major repairs--things do tend to wear out some with age on any car.  Still love driving it.  Very comfortable seats.
"
buick,lacrosse,2006,nkusigep, 05/20/2013,Great on long or short trips.,4,"It rolls a bit through turns and across lanes during lane changes but it's suspension is a little looser which is great for bad roads. It has tons of head and leg room for big and tall people and the seats are very comfortable. Amenities are on-par for the class. It's much more stylish compared to Buicks of the past and you can tell their trying to capture the attention of younger generations, not just the 55+ crowd (no offense). I do mostly highway driving and combined mileage is about 24 mpg - not great but not terrible for a V6.
Acceleration is good."
buick,lacrosse,2006,Ed Erickson, 07/21/2018,"My first Buick, so far, so good",4,"I bought this car last month at 132,000 miles and paid $4000 for it.  The inside is very roomy and comfortable, I am a big guy, used to play football. It's a 3800 V6 and seems to shift smoothly and no problems as of yet. The only negative I see is the glove compartment is very small, and so is the trunk. Both are significantly smaller than my Cavalier that I traded in for this car. Not bad MPG for a 3800 V6 either. I think I got a great value, so far I did.
"
buick,lacrosse,2006,B. Beekman, 10/31/2009,Happy with LaCrosse,4,"I just bought my 2006 LaCrosse about two weeks ago and am very satisfied with it. It's quiet, comfortable, smooth riding and obviously of good quality. The AM/FM/CD player has a nice tone with plenty of space for CD storage. The door locking key-fob is easy to use. Seats are attractive and cloth-covered and very comfortable on long drives.+"
buick,lacrosse,2006,SBurlJeff, 04/02/2009,I Love This Car!,4,"I have had this car for 3 months now.  I wanted something affordable with a little bit of luxury thrown in too. What I got was a whole lot of luxury in a very smart package.  From the leather seating and trim to the audio controls on the steering wheel to the smooth, almost inaudible engine this car is so much more than I expected.  I fall in love with this car every time I get behind the wheel. My insurance dropped considerably too.  I can't believe that not everyone drives a Buick."
buick,lacrosse,2006,Gordon Byers, 06/18/2009,"Ho Hum, just another excellent Buick.",4,"This LaCrosse is the 3rd Buick I've owned, a '82 Riviera and an '89 Regal previously.  They were both excellent performers giving me almost 100,000 miles each of trouble free driving.  The LaCrosse has the comfort of the Riv and the economy of the Regal with plenty of power.  When I step on it to pass, there is no hesitation.   "
buick,lacrosse,2006,KZ, 03/16/2008,A fantastic car and a great value,4,"I have driven the car for several weeks including a 6 hour road trip on the highway. The Lacrosse was a stellar performer in all respects. I owned a 95 Buick Regal GS and a 95 Camaro Z28 previously. Both were awesome cars for their intended design; highway cruiser vs sports car. All cars are compromise vehicles, as a result, you cannot have a sports car that is as comfortable as a family sedan.  However, the new Lacrosse meets this goal better than any other car I have driven. I drove a new Accord and also a Camry and must say they cannot compare to the Lacrosse in terms of looks, performance, and value."
buick,lacrosse,2006,Joe, 04/12/2009,Very Good Car,5,"Have had Buick Regals before with virtually no problems and expect the same with the LaCross. It rides very nicely, good mileage, the 3800 runs like a top as they all do, and it's MADE IN AMERICA!"
buick,lacrosse,2006,Paul, 07/13/2010,I love my Buick,4,"This is one of the best cars I have ever owned.  The quality is really good compared with my previous conception of the ""American"" car.  My car has a 3800 Pontiac Engine they tell me.  It gets around 30 mpg on the road if I stay at 70 mph.  If I go 80 on the turnpike it doesn't seem to hurt mileage that much. The car has more than enough power for passing. If I want to leave a pesty driver in my dust I can do so with ease.   "
buick,lacrosse,2006,Debbie, 09/06/2006,I Love My New Car!,5,"I have only had my car a few days, and really love it! It looks great, the drive is really quiet and comfy, and I am very satisfied. I get great compliments on the looks also. To anyone who thinks a Buick is a ""grandma car"" I say they need to take a new look at the Buick line, especially the sporty look of the LaCrosse!"
buick,lacrosse,2006,Hitman1970, 10/01/2006,Best Vehicle I Have Purchased,4,"Buick got it right this time in a big way.  I am a 35 yr old male, and love just about everything about this car.  The value, price, appearance, ride, and performance were exactly what I was hoping to get in my next auto purchase.  The sleek black exterior with chrome appearance package is very sleek.  The gapping on all the panels inside in out is up there with the best in the industry.  The CXS trim competes with and beats comparable Lexus easily.  The Harmon Kardon sound system is awesome.  Satellite radio is fantastic too.  The ride is smooth and tight on corners.  So glad I considered a Buick.  They are superior vehicles. "
buick,lacrosse,2006,lacrosse buick 2006, 07/09/2008,Buick is a beauty too.,5,"My parents had a yellow 1958 Buick Super. A lot of chrome a beautiful car. The car is just as good today as it was in 1958 in the LaCrosse. Not many LaCrosse's on the road. Maybe, more now, when they read this. Good mileage, comfort, I don't smoke, no ashtrays keeps people from smoking in the car. Great Idea."
buick,lacrosse,2006,MarkZ, 02/09/2010,Comforable and quiet ride,3,"Have drive car 54000 mile with no problems. Very advanced handling and braking system.  A pleasure to drive long distance in the front seat rear is a little tight for adults for more than couple of hours.  Could have made rear seats and leg room more accommodating.  take front the long front end of car or add couple inches to vehicle,   Wish I had bought the lacerne.  Love the heated seats in colder climates and cool mornings. Would like heated front window orwipers snow and ice collect under windshield wipers.  Previous cars Buick Park Ave,Toyota Previa,GMC savannah. Gas mileage could be better(24MPG)200HP traded for power. High performance tires noticeable improvement in ride and handling."
buick,lacrosse,2006,Bev, 06/08/2008,My 2nd Buick,4,I had a 01 Buick LeSabre before and wanted a new car and I liked my Buick so I bought another. The gas mileage is great. Everyone that rides in my car really likes it. Just wish the console was not so far back.
buick,lacrosse,2006,alan , 06/05/2006,Great car for the price,5,After shopping around and looking at most car brands I decided on buying a new LaCrosse. As soon as I took it out for a test drive I knew this was the car I would buy! Because I am in my 40s I wanted something that would be comfortable yet still sporty.I decided on the black onyx with gray interior I also wanted the center console shifter.Yes this car is quiet and has a very smooth ride. For the price I paid (just over 20Gs)I feel like I have a car worth 10 grand more. This is a great car  
buick,lacrosse,2006,Al in Virginia, 07/18/2006,Premium American Style,4,We are completely satisfied with our Buick LaCrosse.  It is an excellent value for any person in the market for a sedan.
buick,lacrosse,2006,Jack, 09/27/2006,"The good,the bad & the ugly",4,"The Lacrosse CXS is fun to drive. Very comfortable seats. Lots of power from the new 3.6 variable-valve-timing V-6. Love the XM satellite radio. Good fit and finish, both inside and out. Good handling car. Much better driving and more comfortable seats than previously owned 2006 Lucerne CXL V-6.  Poor gas mileage on the 3.6 V-6. Some kind of reflection appears in both sideview mirrors (suspect from bright moulding at bottom of front side windows?) Don't like GM forcing customer to buy their OnStar system. I could live without it. Rear seat leg room barely adequate. The rear view is rather ugly, especially with the 2 big tin can mufflers."
buick,lacrosse,2006,j wells, 10/30/2009,Buick Junk,2,"My Buick  Lacrosse  has been a mechanical nightmare.   I have had defective parts replaced consistently since I purchased it  Thank heavens it was still under warranty.  However, now all the seals in the rack and pinion steering need replaced at a cost to me of $900.00  This car is 3 years old!!!!    I drove a ford Taurus for 175,000 miles with major repairs coming after 100,000 miles.  I am fed up with this car,  plan to replace it anything but a Buick.  Oh, I also have water sloshing from one side to the other in my engine.  I have a repeat complaint about this, to no avail.  I am really a dissatisfied customer."
buick,lacrosse,2006,m.r. jensen, 08/25/2005,Not a happy camper,2,"It does not track well on the highway and wants to wander from left to right. It requires constant correction, and is very tiring for long distance drives. It also has a very bad blind spot on left door post. I don't like cruise control on the steering wheel, you have to take eyes off road to set it."
buick,lacrosse,2006,Bob Bennett, 07/29/2006,First Experience,5,"This is my first Buick in my 43 years of driving and owning many different cars.  I am amazed with the comfort, style and the price for so much luxury.  This vehicle is actually fun to drive.  With the cost of gas, the fuel ecomomy for the size and roominess of this vehicle is better then stated both in city and on the highway without cutting power.  The new Buick is now for all ages and it came at the right time.  Buick did their homework and they get an ""A"" with me."
buick,lacrosse,2006,nymonkey, 12/14/2006,"Growing up fast, maybe too fast",4,"I am 26 and recently purchased this vehicle after test driving a 2007 Aveo (too small and cramped for family of 4 ) 2005 Pontiac vVibe (didn't know if I could get used to all the red in the instrument panel) I loved the ride quality compared to the other two vehicles after the intial drive as well as the interior styling classy and understated. I always veiwed Buicks as what you drive when you retire but thought the updated exterior was new and aimed at  a slightly younger generation. After driving the vehicle for 1k mi I find that I may have gone after this car 15 years too early as the quiet, mild mannered, and unresponsive vehicle seems far too boring. Vibe?"
buick,lacrosse,2006,Wayne Knapp, 12/28/2006,"I like my Buick LaCrosse at 2,600 miles",4,"Smooth riding auto, like a Buick should be. Floats a little, but not too much. Handles well but not like a Saab. My best gas mileage is about 27 mpg, is a little better if I do not use the cruise control. Probably drops 1-2 mpg on cruise control. Excellent braking and smooth shifting."
buick,lacrosse,2006,Sylvia, 02/03/2007,It has it all.,5,"LaCrosse is a beautiful, reliable, pampering friend of mine.  This car quickly became a new 'member of the family' if you will. I love how it just takes care of me. It is very quiet, comfortable, it behaves well on the road (it does not float the way oldie Buicks used to but it won't treat you to a nasty choppy ride either) and it is very safe (tested great on the government crash tests). Plus, you have added security and convenience of OnStar, XM radio, handsfree phone right on the steering wheel. I even found a comfy seat setting for my back - something that didn't quite happen even in Audi A6.  The steering is just right, not too hard, not too wiggly and it adjusts to your speed.  "
buick,lacrosse,2006,LS Feldman, 08/14/2007,Young to Buick,4,"After owning Hondas and Toyotas, all are good cars but I must say Buick gives you more for the money.   Ride is quiet, MPG is 30 on the HWY and the car looks big and is roomy for four large guys for a golf day. I paided less than Honda and have more car and the OnStar is a great tool. Monthly service reports online via email.  Go Buick, the LaCrosse is what it takes to win back the Honda Toyota buyer. I was reformed."
buick,lacrosse,2006,AlChip, 10/10/2019,Wonderful Family Car,4,"My wife has loved her LaCrosse and overall it's been a great family car.  We have had it for 13 years and 150K miles.  Smooth acceleration and overall quite reliable.
"
buick,lacrosse,2006,Maddy, 12/30/2019,"Nice, But Not Reliable",3,"I had a 2006 Buick LaCrosse that I purchased from a dealership in summer of 2018. The ODO was just a bit over 100,000. Supposedly the car was in great condition, but stuff started to go wrong with it fairly quickly. It got to the point where I was taking it in every month for a radiator flush, changed the thermometer three times, and ended up trashing it because of engine problems that would’ve ended up costing me more than I paid for it. I ended up having the car for just a little over a year, which was quite sad, because I’ve heard many good things about it. It’s possible that the person who owned it prior to me didn’t take very good care of it, but my experience regardless was very poor with the car. 
"
buick,lacrosse,2006,barbara Kocanda, 06/27/2010,Bad Gas Milage and Poor Pick up,3,"I was told by the dealership that this car gets at least 22 miles to gallon, but after driving it for 3 months I have come to find out that I only get 16 to 18 miles to a gallon. What a disappointment.  Plus, this car has zero pick up.  I will probably trade this car in as soon as possible."
buick,lacrosse,2006,??, 09/08/2007,Regret,2,"I traded in a 2000 Buick Century, which I had bought in Jan, 2000 fresh off the truck, for the 2006 Buick LaCrosse in Dec, 2006.  The LaCrosse had 14,000 miles on it, but besides my trade-in, the LaCrosse cost an add'l $18,000.  I realized I'd made a mistake almost instantly, but was assured that I would get used to the LaCrosse and like it.  I still don't like it and regret that I bought it.  I won't get another Buick.  GM has sacrificed too much in order to have higher profits and the consumer gets stuck with the flimsy trash. The LaCrosse is smaller than the Century and uses more gas, too. "
buick,lacrosse,2006,RR, 05/30/2008,A Fantastic Car for The Price,4,I have driven this car for several months now and really love it. It runs great and is really comfortable. The 3.6 engine has a lot of power on the highway and this car is nice and quite. Very little wind noise.
buick,lacrosse,2006,diefer2, 07/31/2005,LeCrosse Sport,4,"I love driving this car!  On the freeway, it's like I'm being chauffered, but on turns and winding roads, it handles like a sports car.  There are so many bells and whistles attached, that I spent my first weekend just reading and reviewing the manuals and CD's that came with it.  I've always liked Buick vehicles, but until the LeCrosse came out, I thought I'd have to dye my hair silver-blue and move to Sun City Center because that's where all the LeSabre drivers were!"
buick,lacrosse,2006,Steve, 01/08/2020,Should have bought the Honda,2,"It's such a turd. The gas mileage isn't terrible, at about 22 mpg with mostly city driving. Its comfortable and is quiet on the highway. Acceleration and passing power is just OK. 
BUT
It handles awful, the build quality is about what youd expect from a GM - terrible. The transmission is absolute trash. My car has 100K miles and it needs to be replaced. It still drives but it slips, bangs into gears, grinds, etc. - I also owned a 2008 and I went through 3 transmissions during ownership. Also, no leather wrapped steering wheel? C'mon. Yet it has a sunroof, backup sensors? Hmm.

Anyways, I was also looking at a 2002 Honda Accord V6 and I still don't know why I didn't buy it. Will never own another GM. They belong at enterpise. 
"
buick,lacrosse,2006,Jim S, 03/08/2008,Engineers should consult regular drivers,4,"The location of several functions could be placed in a better location. The fuel mileage is much worse than I thought it would have been. I was having problems with the tire pressure, to find out there is some kind of sensor that can only be reset by the dealer, and unfortunately my dealer was unaware of the sensor until recently."
buick,lacrosse,2006,JIM DITTMAR, 10/04/2005,Disappointed Owner,2,I have had extremely poor mileage and there is a strange sound from the engine. Plus there are strong sulphur smells occurring.
buick,lacrosse,2006,Frank, 09/30/2006,Pro's and con's,4,"Pro's: firm road feel, 400 miles to a 17 gallon tank (23.6 mpg), quiet and spacious interior, comfortable cloth seats, attractive exterior colors available. Effective and quiet A/C and heating.  Con's:  what's with the drab instrument display?  Steering wheel could be set a bit further from dash. Inferior audio in base model.  A/C vents with diffused air only.  "
buick,lacrosse,2006,Deb, 01/26/2008,The Best Used Car I Ever Bought,5,"I purchased my Buick LaCrosse in Dec, 2007 and love it! I did however have a steering vibration and when I brought the car in for a steering lubrication (Covered under warranty) The car rides beautiful. No more vibration and a nice quite smooth ride. The dealership has been wonderful at making me comfortable in my LaCrosse. The front 2 tires were worn and they put new ones on. This is by far the most comfortable ride of any car I have owned. Great on gas to. I get about 28 miles per gallon on the highway, hitting any bump amazes me how well this car handles. The interior and exterior is perfect and lots and lots of compliments on it. Picks up very well and handles corners very well. "
buick,lacrosse,2006,Stephen D Rau, 08/11/2005,The American Standard!,4,"The car features firm power seats for the passenger as well as the driver. They're trimmed in leather and have six-way power controls plus there is a lumbar seat adjustment.  The insulation makes the car darned quiet! The CXL is the luxury version with the standard 17"" aluminum wheels.  It looks sleek and stylish, but iit's engine is the one that's become the best running model GM makes. "
buick,lacrosse,2006,Tom, 09/11/2005,Black Buick CX,4,"This is my first Buick. This is a company vehicle so I get my use out of it and drive many miles. 1200 so far and have had it 2 weeks. The CX is loaded with all the basics, ABS, Traction control, remote, etc. The only option was the aluminum wheels which I highly recommend for looks and value. This car rides excellent. mileage is claimed at 20/ 30 and I am getting about 28 mostly highway. The 3.8 has more power than a Taurus V6 and is adequate. The transmission is OK. Great mileage for a car of this size. Positives- Interior very well done, looks rich. Quiet. nice ride, not sporty but not boaty. The black looks like a lexus 300, cool! Very nice fitments. The stereo is excellent."
buick,lacrosse,2006,Stephen D Rau, 09/22/2005,21st Century Buick,4,"The LaCrosse has a tight, responsive suspension and handles better than I would have expected. The headlights are powerful. I don't miss the Zenon projector headlights from my last car. It's subtle, well-executed and built, with the sleek body looking a bit like a concept car. I object to reviewers calling it ""bland"". I see it as elegant and evolutionary. I especially like the front grill and headlight design, which harkens back to the 1950's, but with suitable refinement."
buick,lacrosse,2006,Pat, 11/06/2005,My LaCross,4,"Excellent mpg on the highway. City driving is another story.  When a tall person is sitting (6ft husband with long legs) in the front seat with seat pushed back, there is very little room in the rear.  "
buick,lacrosse,2006,dp, 01/07/2006,Smooth and relaxing,4,"Very well built safe feeling car. The styling may be a little bit behind the times, but it definitely stands out above the rest on the road.  Every other car looks the same.  It is so quiet it's hard to tell if the engine is running inside or outside of the car.  It reminds me so much of my 1989 Olds Cutless Supreme SL I had for 13 years, which I loved.  I got it with 6 passenger seating (sort of like a bench seat)with a flip fold console."
buick,lacrosse,2006,Jan Busch, 02/04/2006,Awesome Car,5,"We love this car! It is fun to drive and great to get into after it was started from inside the warm house.  We feel very safe in it.  The body style is very modern, the seats comfortable and warm in the Minnesota winters. "
buick,lacrosse,2006,brenda, 02/28/2006,Love my LaCrosse,4,"I got  a Lacrosse in December. And I love it. This is my first Buick but, will not be my last. All of the rest my family drives Buicks. I love the design of the LaCrosse. It looks like a classic sports car. If it is a good as the Buicks my Father has owned it will be and outstanding car."
buick,lacrosse,2006,Mr.Fizzix, 03/11/2006,Buick,4,"Very happy with the car.  Drives really smooth, very quiet, and comfortable. Steering is firm and precise. Some body roll exists, but the car handles well (for it's size). Good throttle response. Controls are intuitive and simple, nicely laid out. Interior layout overall is great.  I'm up in Toronto, and had it out on a couple of cold days. Warms up real quick, and defogging works real quick too.  Visibility isn't great though. There is a pretty big blind spot to the front left (due to the roof pillar/left mirror). It's actually quite annoying for making left turns, or on windy roads. The car is wonderful otherwise.  Don't know fuel economy yet, only had it for a week."
buick,lacrosse,2006,Gene Mazza, 04/10/2006,LaCrosse Great Car,4,"Buick surprised me, I have owned Pontaics,  Honda Accord EX-V6,My wife has a Camry. This car blows the imports out of the water, and at a great price. Makes the Honda EX V-6 ride/ perform like a Model T. Highly recommend this car to anyone wanting a great ride, comfort for a price way below imports. Buick finally found the younger market."
buick,lacrosse,2006,DEE, 05/21/2006,Buick? Yeah it's a Buick!,5,"LaCrosse is a great car. This is my second Buick had a Rendezvous prior. This one is mine though to drive to work. Nicely appointed, great pickup and it look great. This car is great, and would recommend it to anyone. People say ""Oh that is a sharp car, but it's a Buick."" SO WHAT, wake up and smell the new interior. This car is great, so is it brother the Lucerne, and the new Enclave concept will rock too!! Get in the game people, be ahead of the rest of the sheep. Get a Buick!"
buick,lacrosse,2006,Roger Cox, 06/02/2006,Best By Far,5,I have never road in a vehicle that has been so comfortable or quiet.  By far it is the best vehicle I have ever owned.
buick,lacrosse,2006,Jim Houston, 07/04/2006,My 2006 Buick,4,    I find it comfortable to drive and be in for long periods of time. Responds well in traffic and has good power and economy.
buick,lacrosse,2006,tanker 31, 07/05/2006,Steering,2,"Car steers like a truck. Car floats along the highway at posted speeds.Moves from side to side. Gas mileage  on highway about 26.5. Have to take out coolant bottle to check the power steering fluid? Raspy noise and some rubbing coming from steering section when I back up, can feel it on the steering wheel. Still have to manually adjust the seat back. Over all just un-impressed with car for the bucks I had to put out. Will not purchase another GM car period. "
buick,lacrosse,2006,DonBoltz, 07/06/2006,Excellent Auto,4,This is my fourth Buick and they have all been good cars and I would buy another one in three to five years. GM has improved their construction of the cars and they are togather as good as the Japanese autos. I still believe in the autos of USA.  
buick,lacrosse,2006,BC, 07/10/2006,New,4,Bought brand new looks great runs good 200 miles on it now hope the brand new feel stays around so far the only thing I wish is that fog lights became standard for better visibility but I am surprised at how quiet it is.
buick,lacrosse,2006,Jules, 07/12/2006,Wonderful,4,"Very fun car, have owned Infiniti's, BMW's, and Mercedes, and this blows themn out of the water in style, performance, and luxury. Love the dual zone air conditioning. Had to floor the car to avoid getting in an accident on the highway and it was very responsive. Got a fully loaded CXL for 28,000. That's what you pay for a base Infiniti. Opt for this. "
buick,lacrosse,2006,thomas, 07/30/2005,Great Car,4,"A very quiet auto. Fun to drive, and has lots of power. I rate it up there with Cadillac."
buick,lacrosse,2006,nammtapp, 07/30/2005,Excellent rating for Buick LaCrosse,4,"This is an excellent automobile.  It is a much better car than the Toyota Camry, Nissan Altima, or other Japanese cars.  It is much quieter and much better built. It is not an old folks Buick."
buick,lacrosse,2006,Paul Colella, 08/01/2005,CXL fun to drive,4,"I have had my CXL nearly a month and already have 1800 miles on it. I love it. This is a big improvement over the Regal (I had 3 previous Regals). The ride is much smoother and quieter.  I was disappointed in the performance of the '03 Regal and found it rather noisy. After reading about the new design and engineering of the LaCrosse I just had to try it. After 1 long test drive I fell in love with it. Although I passed on the heated seats option, it is a nice feature.  My only regret is that I didn't get the CXS model. "
buick,lacrosse,2006,michael paganini, 08/22/2005,Mike's Buick,4,I have always loved a Buick since I purchased my first one in 1967. That Buick skylark was the best car I ever owned until this one. This has elegance and great handling at a very fair price. It really is a fun car to drive. I can't wait for my wife to ask me to do errands.(she doesn't drive).
buick,lacrosse,2006,Babs 4-3, 09/07/2005,my LaCrosse,5,"I could not have bought a better car, the LaCrosse is just the right car for me.  I also have the remote start, and living in OR. where it does snow and get cold, it will be great to warm it up, I have already used it when we have temps in the high 90's to cool it down.  It works great"
buick,lacrosse,2006,bill miller, 09/15/2005,A Jewel of a car / 05 LaCrosse,5,"This automobile drives and rides better than anything I've ever owned.  It is quiet, confortable, handles well in all driving situations, and is a joy to travel with on a trip.  It doesn't pretend to be a trendy sports sedan with too much glitz and impractical compromises.  The car is an extremely well made sensible car for grownups. "
buick,lacrosse,2006,Frank, 09/17/2005,Nice wheels,5,A perfect car for the times. Not too large but plenty of room and great on gas.  
buick,lacrosse,2006,bernie, 01/14/2006,The come back Buick,4,"If only more younger people would test drive the Lacrosse CXS, Buick would be on its way to losing its image as the old folks car. The 3.6 liter engine always has plenty of power, but the car's real strength lies in its suspension. This car never meets a curve it doesn't love. And the sound insulation is outstanding. This is a car that loves to be driven and driven hard. Give it a try."
buick,lacrosse,2006,fred, 01/29/2006,Great Car,4,"First Buick, I think GM has a real winner in this car, priced right, drives great, it seems to be really balanced it just feels right."
buick,lacrosse,2006,Sean, 02/12/2006,Awesome,4,"This car was a total surprise to me.  I went in search of a new car during employee pricing.  I went to every manufacturer and wound up at a Buick dealer last.  The LaCrosse struck my eye.  I test drove it and bought it.  My first American made car ever, and now I can't see any reason not to buy American again."
buick,lacrosse,2006,Hunt, 02/16/2006,LaCrosse,4,"Great ride and quiet.  Great car for the price range.  A little concerned with the mileage.  1000 miles and when setting cruise at 78 only getting 24 mph.  Trying to this week at 72mph to see the improvement.  It handles in line for a sedan in my opinion and think the edmunds guys should compare apples to apples and not this reasonably priced car againt 30,000+ imports.  Great looking and performing car in my opinion"
buick,lacrosse,2006,Dominic, 03/22/2006,Almost Perfect Auto,4,"Have driven this car for over 6000 miles and it has been a most rewarding driving experience.  Strong points are solid construction, quiet ride, strong engine and generous trunk.  Only weak point is the fuel mileage, about 24 to 25 mpg on the highway."
buick,lacrosse,2006,tridentnyc, 04/30/2006,Great Car!!,4,"I love this car! Buick really has done an excellent job with the LaCrosse. This car shows that the long held misconception that foreign imports are always better than American made cars is just plain wrong. Congratulations to GM and Buick for making one beautiful car...inside and out!  P.S. I could only give the reliability rating a ""5"" or average, because I've only had the car for two months...I'm sure it will be much higher."
buick,lacrosse,2006,Karen S. Wilson, 06/13/2006,Surprised and Delighted,4,"I really liked the style of this vehicle. I had a Lincoln Cont. I loved that car, but it was a 98 and started to have costly problems.  I am not a GM person.  I seen this black on black leather car in the showroom. It had everything and more that my Lincoln had. Remote start and 6 cyl. Better gas mileage I thought.  I bought it and have not regreted it.  I have had alot of compliments on the looks.  It runs great and has everything that a high priced Lexus, Infinity or Lincoln would have only it doesn't hurt my pocket book. I really like the fact that it is Front wheel drive.  I live in Ohio and won't own anything but.  The Zepher was very high priced.  "
buick,lacrosse,2006,Herbert W. Hallman, 07/20/2006,Couldn't be happier!,4,"My wife and I love this car. We traded a '97 BMW 528i that we purchased new and initially had some trepidations about our chioce. No longer. Other than somewhat skimpy leg room in the rear and a shallow rear seat, I can think of no negatives. It drives and handles superbly. We love the uncomplicated, staight-across dashboard, the quiet engine and feel of solidity the car engenders. Moreover the car offers exceptional value, in my opinion, when you consider all the extras (6-way power seat on front passenger side, remote engine start, OnStar, XM radio, heated front seats, etc.) "
buick,lacrosse,2006,Kirk, 09/08/2006,Talk about value!,4,"I put a great deal of time and research in before deciding to buy this car.  I looked at 300, Impala, Saturn Azura, and the Grand Prix.  I am a GM discount buyer, but even if I wasn't, this would have been the car I would have bought. 4 year 50,000 warranty a plus.  It has rear head airbags standard, a $700 option on some cars! I traded my BMW 740i in for this car.  The more I drive, the more I like it.  Compare and you'll see the value.  OnStar is great to have. The rebates easily made this a hands down winner."
buick,lacrosse,2006,jimj, 09/25/2006,Well pleased,4,"Now have 600 miles on car and remain generally pleased. Car is a great value, rides too good. At 65mph, feels like 40 mph.  Hope it does not get me too many tickets. Some improvements could be added. Trunk has no handle to open lid, requires fingernails be placed under lid to open. Power steering pump requires coolant bottle be removed to check fluid level. Love the trip computer, but need to figure out how it works. Car should have fuel range of 510 miles with a full tank, but computer says about 375 at fill up, then increases as I drive. I guess it's reacting to how fast/economically I am driving, but I would prefer it to go the the full range at fillup and then reduce available miles as I drive"
buick,lacrosse,2006,Jim, 11/20/2006,Nice car,4,"After 3 months of shopping for a car for my charming wife, I decided on the Buick LaCrosse. Nice fit and finish, very comfortable ride, and lots of safety features.  This car has great manners! GM put a lot of attention into the details on this one.  Quality materials with an expensive feel on the inside, fit and finish to rival the best cars on the market, great ride and stereo. The exterior styling is pure class. "
buick,lacrosse,2006,fritz wackernagel, 12/01/2006,New car every year,4,"A quiet cushioned ride. The best Buick ride ever. Ample power, 24mpg city, and quality build make me a proud owner"

buick,lacrosse,2006,2006 LACROSSE CX, 01/02/2007,My Buick,4,"This is my third Buick after 1996 Century and 2001 Century models.  The 2001 was a vast improvement over the 1996 model but I feel the 2006 LaCrosse is not much better over my 2001.  The handling and road ride is much better and improved on the 2006.  The big difference I noticed is the standard options were reduced on the 2006.  I thought in keeping up with the great Buick name that a safety option like heated mirrors would have been standard, also dual controlled heating and air would have remained for a standard option.  A problem with my car is when I first start out and then turn my front tires/wheels make a sort of growling sound and then it goes away after I'm moving. "
buick,lacrosse,2006,LaCrosse CX, 01/01/2007,Buick LaCrosse 2006,5,"I enjoy my LaCrosse on the open road she gets good fuel mileage. Also very comfortable driving. No back problems with this one. Don't feel the bumps as much with this one. It is quiet inside. The coefficant drag is good in my opinion. Nice curves and good looks as well. I like the sound system you can adjust to differant types of music. good seating. Easy steering, good maintainability Not a lot of clutter under the hood. The engine could be much quieter than it is. Hope next model year this will improve. I hope for the Stabilitrac in future."
buick,lacrosse,2006,Glen L. Wright, 02/12/2007,Ownership experience,5,"I get 29.5 mpg highway and 19 city. Consumer reports says 17 mpg overall. All Japanese cars are rated higher so why does GM allow this. The engine is much quieter than many cars including Japanese so why does Consumer Reports say engine is coarse. The car handles beautifully and is fun to drive. The back seat could use a bit more head room and the trunk lid needs a handle. Overall,  this car is excellent. I have owned three Buick Lasabres and they all got 30mpg or better highway driving. I drove from Mcintosh, FL to Franklin, NC a distance of 540 miles on one tank of gas. The fit of doors, trunk lid and hood is excellent . This heavy car is safer than many Japanese cars in a crash"
buick,lacrosse,2006,Don R, 05/21/2007,Not my father's Buick,5,"I never even thought of a Buick until a relative suggested I go look at one. I had been looking at the Impala but once I laid eyes on the LaCrosse there was no going back. The roadability, quietness and luxury was more than expected. It was at the high end of our budget, $29,000, but well worth it."
buick,lacrosse,2006,anniston, 09/04/2007,Average Little Car,4,"My job takes me all around the South, so I spend much of my time in the car. I alternate between my Lacrosse company car and my personal Tahoe. All in all, this is a pretty good little car. I always had either a Lesabre or Park Avenue company car before the Lacrosse, and no it does not ride as good and it is not as comfortable, but it really is a bang for the buck. It also gets great gas mileage, usually around 31 MPG on the interstate going 70-75 MPH."
buick,lacrosse,2006,Vijay, 09/07/2007,Excellent buy compared to Imports,5,"A very nice car. Have been driving it for the past year. No problems whatsoever. Very, very quiet. Looks great. Fuel economy of 29-30 mpg on highway and 25 mpg average. Only crib is that the CD player does not play MP3s and there is no port to hook up iPod. Otherwise a great car."
buick,lacrosse,2006,Jake, 07/19/2007,Great highway car,5,"I bought my Lacrosse last year and do a lot of highway travel.  It gets great gas milage I can depend on getting 30 MPG on the highway.  The ride is incredible and coupled with XM radio and the piece of mind of Onstar the miles fly buy.  The remote start is nice during the winter, I like that the climate control will automatically turn on the defosters when using the  remote start.  I have yet to have anything go wrong with it."
buick,lacrosse,2007,ann6701, 08/28/2011,headlights turn off then on at will,4,"I have a 2007 Buick Lacrosse, bought a few months old, with 6,000 miles on it. No problems except replaced the cabin air filter, & battery. It now has 23,000 miles on it. Then a month ago, the headlights started going off, then back on about 10 minutes later. How many have had that problem? I was told it was the BCM, a few hundred dollars.
Any other ideas that have worked? This is scary!!!! "
buick,lacrosse,2007,jabutix, 12/05/2006,Better than I expected,4,The LaCrosse CXL is a real winner. It is quiet and fun to drive on the freeway and good and responsive at city driving. It has a very smooth suspension and quiet ride. I recently travelled with friends and at the end of the trip everyone commented on how rested they felt. 
buick,lacrosse,2007,Dick Lee, 07/23/2006,Best car for the money,5,"This car is at the top of the heap as for as I'm concerned. Quiet the word here. Plenty of power from the proven 3.8 V6 engine. 28 mpg. Styling, comfort, roadhandling, all excellent. A ton of car for the money. $24k sticker and lots of GM incentives make this a spectacular investment.  Finally  GM has got it right with this one! A lot of thought to details went into this vehicle. Leasing is a very afordable option to owning this great car. We just love this vehicle of all the previous cars we have owned."
buick,lacrosse,2007,jim wojciechowski, 06/25/2006,Quality car,4,"Much improved over Century, attractive interior, quiet ride and lots of convenient gadgets, fun to drive has all comforts and feel of larger car. Very solid, excellent finished product."
buick,lacrosse,2007,JR, 12/05/2009,CXL,4,"This has been one of the best vehicles I ever owned. I own a ES300 and we used this car more because of the comfort and the higher miles per gallon. The exterior is boring, but everything else about the car has been very good. Great power in the V6 and no mechanical problem over the two years I have owned the LaCrosse. I run about 30,000 miles a year and the car has 90,000 miles without any major problems, just change the oil, tranny fuel, gas up and go."
buick,lacrosse,2007,Pissed off, 04/30/2010,Shaking won't stop,2,"This car has been to three dealerships with the same vibration issue, replaced axles, hubs, tires and still shakes, steering pulls to the right. Driver side door leaks in rain. Dealers are as frustrated with GM as I am and no relief in site. GM is not authorizing the proper repairs. I think they know what the problem is and are just dragging their feet trying to wear me down. I traded a 1995 Avalon XLS with 263,000 miles and no real problems on this piece of junk. Shame on GM for treating its customers so poorly. They deserve to go bankrupt without any bail out. Never again will I go with an American made piece of junk like this car. "
buick,lacrosse,2007,james, 07/13/2009,a fine automobile,4,Swapped a '98 Regal w/ 163000 miles for this honey.  No one has mentioned the greatly improved driver's seat - this one needs no extra firming to make it tolerable on a long drive!  Room is adequate for us and I am impressed by Buick's overall long-term reliability. This 3rd Buick in 20 years.      My only negative is that the rearview mirrors create some strange blind spots that have to be considered at all times.
buick,lacrosse,2007,loveit2007, 08/28/2011,LOVE IT!!!!,4,"Love this LaCrosse.
Have had to barely spend any money on it.
Very reliable, comfortable, and it still looks really good---can't tell it's a 2007!!!"
buick,lacrosse,2007,Bumpy, 07/27/2010,Stuck in the Middle,3,"I neither love or hate this car. Exterior looks great with chrome package, except rear end is too bland. Interior is typical with fake wood from Buick. More road noise than I expected.  Handles well with a firm ride, not plush, you feel the road. This is not an old  mans car.  The 3800 series 3 is an outstanding motor despite its unrefined feel.  Most of the reviews are, as usual, from newbies and problem cars.  For those of you with steering/pulling issues please consider replacing the intermediate shaft.  There some bad tires out there but tires are frequently a symptom of another problem. Note the difference in alignment with a loaded vehicle if there is a persistent alignment issue."
buick,lacrosse,2007,Nothappywithbuick, 12/23/2009,"Engine, Transmission problems at 20K",2,"Ok, it's been at the dealer more than at my house for the past 6 weeks.  With only 22k miles on it, it needs a new cylinder head, gaskets, etc... just a few weeks ago, it was shifting hard so they reprogrammed the Transmission Module.  After owning years of Oldsmobile (Intriges, Alero, Cutlass) I have to say, I'm done with GM Junk.  Ford or Imports only for me."
buick,lacrosse,2007,Bob, 09/08/2009,Nice Car,4,"I leased this car back in 07 and have not had one problem. My dealer ran a computer search for the CXS in the color and options I wanted. For me it fits my needs perfectly, love the remote start, sport tuned suspension(FE3), 3.6 dohc engine is excellent and still gets good gas mileage. "
buick,lacrosse,2007,marymaep, 11/09/2009,LaCrosse LaCrosse,4,"brought this car with 31,000 from a dealership. with about 40,000 miles it had to be taken in for some sort of air conditioning problem. it stunk when you turned it on. yuck. now im seeming to have a problem turning on the dang car but could be a minor problem. all in all ive been pretty happy with my buick lacrosse besides those things."
buick,lacrosse,2007,Susan smith, 01/02/2017,Love my buick,4,"First buick and I love it. Always reliable. Easy to maintain need to be able to raise seats higher on the driver side. Seatbelt chokes and slow to warm up in the cold cold weather. The sound system is awesome. Better sound system than the 2017 lacrosse. So if you like quality sound and I do watch out for the newer models
"
buick,lacrosse,2007,DannyBoy, 04/24/2019,Got a good one,5,"It seems some 2007's were built better than others, based on reviews. So sorry for those who got lemons. I am lucky, I guess; I have one that fits all the accolades. Beautiful car; reliable, responsive, and extremely comfortable. I echo the reviewer whose passengers felt rested after a trip -- mine is an outlandishly rider friendly car. Mileage per gallon isn't bad; OK around town, but wow up to 30 mpg on the highway (watch your tire pressure!) I have had no mechanical problems; regular maintenance only. I also own a 2017 Subaru, which I also love, with modern sensors and other new features. This LaCross, while state of the art at the time, feels retro now, a vibe I dig. I feel gnarly and elegant when I'm out in it. Never thought of myself as a Buick guy. Live and learn."
buick,lacrosse,2007,brianmbi1, 02/03/2010,Michelle Is ahead of service department,3,"Overall the car has had a lot of problems. The transmission had to be replaced at 28,000. Clear coat came off the doors, and had to be re-painted. The weather seal around the front doors leaked in a rain storm or in the car wash. Car went back to the shop last night for idling rough and probably the CV shafts are going to need to be replaced. I'm not happy with this car at all--One problem after another for the last 30,000 miles.  "
buick,lacrosse,2007,rsb90, 09/05/2013,Not bad,4,"I have to say I like this car. Despite it needing some work since I've owned it, anything I've had done is to be expected with owning any car. I like the design of the newer models, so if this one continues to be a good car for me, I may trade it in for a new Lacrosse when the time comes."
buick,lacrosse,2007,Seth, 05/20/2016,Satan's Buick,1,"So far this has been the 2nd worst car my family has ever owned.  We once sent a neon to the scrap yard with 60,000 miles on it.  This car gets poor gas milage.  On a good day I can get around 22mpg.  I've had at least 3 v8 cars that could get around 25 mpg, and they all had a lot more power.  There is a clunk in the steering that can't seem to get fixed.  There is also a vibration in the front end that won't go away.  The front sway bar snapped.  The drivers door leaks in the rain.  The headlights are always burning out.  The transmission slips and then suddenly slams before it takes off.  It has needed a four wheel alignment.  It was just eating tires.  The writing has rubbed off of the buttons for the radio and the heating and air.  The letters fall off of the outside too.  It just say la rosse.  The CXL is totally gone.  The back seat is very cramped even for children.  When you pop the trunk it is difficult to open unless you have really skinny fingers.  The air bag light goes on and off as you drive.  The traction control and ABS light come on and go off whenever they feel like it.  That doesn't bother me though because when it's slick out the traction control and ABS gets in the way more than it helps on this car.  I like having traction control and ABS usually.  This car is downright dangerous in the snow.  The ABS comes on almost as soon as you touch the pedal.  It will make you miss turns.  Then when you get back on the gas the traction control is there to cut the power.  I feel safer in my 2 wheel drive ford ranger pick up in the snow.  The brakes are not powerful enough even on dry pavement really.  I'm ready to junk this thing with only 120,000 miles on it.  The ranger by that way has 200,000 on it without skipping a beat.  I have tried hard to maintain this car, but its useless.  To me it is obvious why GM needed a bail out and Ford did not.
"
buick,lacrosse,2007,Riley, 04/10/2008,Complaints,3,"The car is like a standard transmission on hills. You have to be quick from brake to gas because it will roll back. I am having trouble getting tires balanced.  Dealer replaced all four tires on car because they could not be balanced. I am still having trouble on rear tires. They have been balanced  three times. I am taking the car back to try again. I have 2500 miles on car at this time. The radio skips stations. I was told by dealers that the transmission was normal, to me it is a danger as cars pull up close behind. I have been back to dealer so much I am taking a rest for a while."
buick,lacrosse,2007,Bob, 12/15/2016,Bought used at 95000 miles,3,"Bought it used for 5000. Liked the look and feel on the road. Drove a few of them and liked it.Most dealers seem to charge 6-8k for these cars but that is way too much for this car. It has a history of tranny and other issues so you need to figure that into the price and bargain them down. This car has been fine. Quiet and smooth on the road. Has some downshifting issues that are well documented on the net but so far mine is manageable. Only 4 speed. Needs 5. Mileage is 17 and 27 just like the sticker says. So far glad I bought the car after 10000 miles of driving. Note: This is my first car with ""leather"" interior so I bought some leather conditioner/cleaner stuff to maintain it. But guess what ! It's actually 80% vinyl. Which I found out is typical of ""leather"" interiors these days. Go figure.

At 108,000 still running fine.

buick,lacrosse,2007,I hate this car !!!!, 08/27/2009,And they want you to buy American,2,I was driving a Maxima for some time and wanted a change.  I was convinced to buy American when I really didn't want too.  If I knew then what I know now I would never have gotten this Buick LaCrosse. This Buick has been to the dealership 5 times for ONE problem; something with the steering column.  I was given an extended warranty by Buick but that did not work.  It's still not working right.  The car is going back for round six and the SAME ISSUE.  I am never going with American cars again. Thanks Buick for making such great American products.  HA 
buick,lacrosse,2007,J HARLOW, 05/19/2007,Buick LaCrosse CXS,4,I have the performance engine and it is great! I also like the chrome accents that are optional and the chrome wheels. We get outstanding comments on this car. The light leather interior is perfect!
buick,lacrosse,2007,darwin, 07/04/2008,Worth the money,4,"When I bought this car, I felt for the first time buying a car that I got a car that gives me more bang for my buck. The safety features in the car are great. Front and side air bags, traction control. The car is very confortable and does very well for gas mileage I have the CXL and I'm getting about 32 mpg on the highway. Very sturdy vehicle, safe and well worth the money if you are looking into getting a family car. "
buick,lacrosse,2007,Jeannie, 04/03/2007,Very Pleased,4,"I have been in the car business for many years. I have yet to find a car that handles this well or rides as quiet at the LaCrosse. Happy with gas consumption as well. If you're looking for a great, roomy ride in this car class, you just have to drive one."
buick,lacrosse,2007,Mike Perry, 07/19/2007,Look again Consumer Reports,4,"Car magazines under rate this car, while owners rave about them.Lets start with the outstanding good looks of the vehicle, no other car can compare to it for looks. So I would advise those who test these cars to ""look again"" and rate them more fairly. If you had to buy a car for your own use you would want one of these."
buick,lacrosse,2007,Tim, 09/19/2007,There are a few warts,3,"Overall, very satisfied, but have a few warnings. MPG is hopelessly below what the EPA sticker says (barely get 20mpg in city). Although the trunk is voluminous, the opening is smaller than the Century and I find it difficult to get large objects inside. And whoever put that piece of chrome across the middle of the dash so all sunlight from 10am to 2pm shines directly in the driver's eyes needs to be flogged.  "

buick,lacrosse,2007,charles kelsey, 10/05/2006,My only quirk,4,My only problem with the 2007 is the non retracting side mirrors. i live in a metro city on small street and still dont understand why car manufacturers dont make this a S.O.P. Obiviously they dont have to pay to have their side mirrors replaced annualy. Not to mention the smokers package i wont start on that you non smokers should keep your hands out of my pocket. 
buick,lacrosse,2007,FRED LEONARD, 07/11/2008,Quiet Quality & Affordable,4,In my effort to downsize I went a little too small. Cabin is cramped for me & backseat is tight. Needs a modern engine & 6-speed transmisson. Flat spots in the power ranges due to lack of gears. It is a very nice car that is smooth & quiet for its size & price. No problems except for recalls.
buick,lacrosse,2007,robert, 07/17/2007,One great buy,4,"My intentions were to purchase a Honda Accord for the gas milelege and resale. When I first look at the Lacrosse in May without the Chrome Package & it looked plain to me. I drove the car 1500 miles on vacation last week and what a ride. I want to commend Buick on the ride, performance, and most of all the gas milelege for a new car. Wow, 30MPG. What a great car. I never was so pleased "
buick,lacrosse,2007,frevash, 08/30/2007,It's a nice car,3,"Mixed highway/suburban mileage driven in flat to somewhat hilly areas. Average mileage per gallon between fill-ups rarely reaches 20mpg. Given Japanese competition that's rather surprising. Our 2001 LeSabre does it better. Was forewarned by Consumer Reports, but bought the car  nevertheless, because I liked looks and ride.Time Elapsed feature doesn't work; outside temperature gage is off by at least five degrees (too high); clock has lost two minutes in three months of ownership. For my next purchase. I'll try and overcome my ""Buy American"" hangup, if necessary.   "
buick,lacrosse,2007,JohnB, 06/02/2007,Dissappointed,3,"This car has many nice features, but I am very dissappointed it dosen't have memory seats, rain sensing wipers, heat/ac temp. control on steering wheel, and no rear seat heat/ac ducts on a $33000. vehicle. I also miss the heads up display on my previous Buick. This car will have a short time in my garage for these reasons only."
buick,lacrosse,2007,Florida Amy, 07/22/2007,"LaCrosse, Best in Class",5,"We are absolutely thrilled with our LaCrosse.  It is luxurious and exilerating.  I look for reasons to leave the house just so I can drive the LaCrosse.  The 3.8l V-6 needs no urging and jumps at the chance to run like the wind!  It dives into corners with an unquenchable hunger and the traction control adds a new level of control.  The car is almost alive in it's ability to know how to get through the corners.  You don't drive a LaCrosse, you command a LaCrosse! We've never been so thrilled by a ""luxury"" sedan."
buick,lacrosse,2007,ron, 09/14/2007,Old folks car,4,"Driving compartment feels cramped, parking seems to require more effort on the steering wheel. Closing the trunk lid requires you to put your hands on the trunk to close the lid. Needs a handle."
buick,lacrosse,2007,Joy, 03/26/2008,Should have kept the 2001 Century I had,3,"I traded my 2001 Century for the 2007 LaCrosse. Bad mistake.  Interior is small. Everything inside is plastic and rattles all the time. It has rattled since I drove it off the lot with 5 miles on it. Chrome and fake wood reflect sunshine bad and streetlights relfect bad off of it at night. Those pieces also rattle. Took it to the dealer and they said nothing could be done about the rattling. Windshield leaks air and has a whistle at 60 mph.  Gas mileage stinks. Century got 10 mpg better even after 150,000 plus miles. Trunk is very hard to shut. Large trunk but small opening. Rough ride with a lot of road noise. I'm very disappointed in this car.  "

I've had it about 4 months now and I love driving it. Mine is black and I have to say, (no offense to anybody) I've seen it in several colors and this car just looks better in black.

Only problem experienced so far is the catalytic convertor was replaced this week, with 24,000 plus miles. Bought the car as a demo for the PGA tournaments.

I looked at a 2007 CX with 12,111 miles on it, no leather, no heated seats but bought it anyway. I am so glad I did because it is really a quiet, well mannered car (and I saved $10K). It is an absolute pleasure to drive and the fit and finish inside and out are excellent. I am very happy with this car and believe it stacks up well compared to the equivalent Toyota and Honda."
buick,lacrosse,2007,dvdvon, 08/31/2007,I love my Buick,5,"I researched this car for a few months and decided on the Buick rather than a small Lexus or Mercedes. The new JDE Power dependability ratings make me feel really good about my selection. Cannot say anything bad about the car. Lively in tight situations while still exhibiting the Buick trademark smooth ride.  Great fit and finish.  Very pleased.  A ""grown up"" car you don't have to be a grandfather to love."

It is roomy, and the heated seats feel great after a long day at work.
I like how it isn't over the top with gizmos and gadgets on the dash, but has enough to make me feel I am getting what I paid for.
The ride is smooth, and it isn't jumpy when accelerating.
I like the shorter stopping distances.
I have seen a lot of reviews elsewhere that seem to think this is a sports car.
No, this is a luxury sedan.
I'm not in my 80's I'm in my 20's, and enjoy all of the comfort, and all of the horsepower.
I don't intend on using this car to run the Daytona 500, so, who cares about RWD vs FWD?

I always thought the LaCrosse was sharp, and the Super takes that a step further. Being black with the tasteful chrome trim, including the optional chrome wheels, it gets compliment after compliment. Wasnt sure how I felt about the dark brown interior but it has grown on me. Love the power and ride, but after only a couple of months of ownership, the transmission has had to be completely overhauled. Since its still under warranty, Im taking it in stride.

Just finally took it back to the dealer for the first time to have the breaks checked, need new pads on the front.  I do have the oil changed about every 8,000 files. Best car I've ever owned for quality and reliability.  Not happy to see the 2010 model has the gas on the passenger side yuck. I think I'll keep my 2008 for a while."

Currently have about 42 k miles.
Engine, 5.3L V-8, has been apart twice to replace lifters (GM TSB #06-06-05-001E). considerable vibration when AFM in 4 cyl mode (GM TSB #06-06-05-001E) Clear coat peeled from door pillars, glover box door latch broke, power Drivers Seat gear broke!
 Memory seats and power recline were not available!
Have had same AFM problems with 5.3L in my 2011 Suburban!!
Have had 11 NEW GM products and 2 new Jeeps plus several used cars/trucks since 1980.
Will not buy another GM product new or used!!"
buick,lacrosse,2008,Tammy, 11/07/2008,Great Car on Base Price,4,"Purchased this 08 LaCrosse in April, 2008, have 20,000 on it already and love it! Got the base model, but it's a Buick! So it has all the creature comforts--power windows, door locks, and driver seat; cruise, tilt--and great gas mileage. Good git-up-and-go and plenty of room inside. Nice sized steering wheel for a womans hands. Only knock is the trunk is a little narrow to get a large suitcase into and out of easily, but I love the trunk release design! Overall, a great vehicle for the money.  "
buick,lacrosse,2008,Senior Driver, 12/11/2008,Using Oil,4,"Love the car, except it uses oil. First 3000 miles, used two extra quarts, dealer says drive it and it will get better. Second 3500 miles, used one and a half extra quarts of oil. I quess this is better, but I don't think good. Dealer says keep watching it and one quart in 3000 miles is acceptable. Maybe to him but not to me. I ask that it be recorded on my record. Hope they did it. If it doesn't improve, I going to try going to Buick."
buick,lacrosse,2008,dianne , 07/29/2009,buick lacrosse,3,"This is my 4th Buick, love the new design, my son said it doesn't look like a old person car like the ones in the pass. The car had 20,000 miles when I got it. Has a vibration problem had tires balance no help, call dealership they said new tires, don't thing that the problem, my old century and lasabre rides better than this and they had 185,000 miles. The driver seat is unsuportive has some give."
buick,lacrosse,2008,g. edmonds, 07/13/2010,Good but could be better,4,"This is my 5th Buick, but not my favorite.  My '02 Buick Regal was more comfortable to drive. The front windshield is set at an odd angle. I lose my peripheral vision in certain instances (possibly due to sleek design - I checked the 2010 and it does not have this problem) and the self-darkening interior rear view mirror is not dark enough for cars that have high beams &/or maladjusted running lights. Otherwise it handles well and has good pick-up. Car has only 19,000 miles and so far, no major problems. Interior front passenger carpet keeps coming away from frame.  I've had it in for repairs 5 times. "
buick,lacrosse,2008,Leonard Hatteberg, 03/14/2008,2008 Buick LaCrosse,4,"Much will be a comparison of our 2008 Buick LaCrosse vs. our 2001 Century. Buick advertises a smoother, quieter ride. This has proven true. Our car come with the convenience package which gives us heated seats, lumbar support and much electronic instrumentation which is good, but hard to learn & understand. The LaCrosse I believe has a little less headroom over the door when getting in and out which has made it a little more difficult for my slightly stiff 80 year old 5'10"" frame. The Century had directional lights which lit up the road in the direction you were turning, which we miss. The LaCrosse does not. The gas mileage has gone down considerably. 19.5 MPG vs. 23 mpg.  Good car overall."
buick,lacrosse,2008,wa, 04/06/2008,Different side of Buick,4,"I have had this car for about a week now and I'm really surprised. The styling is excellent. I like the front end more than i do the rear. I alwasy thought that Buick was styled for the elderly, but they sure proved me wrong with thier new line of cars. The interior could be desinged nicer, but overall it is very comfortable. The power is excellent too! There really isn't any turbo lag, so it's fun to just floor it."
buick,lacrosse,2008,Bob, 04/17/2008,Over rated Buick,2,"I've read the other review and wonder what car they are driving.  Thankfully this is a lease car from my company, and I cannot wait to be rid of it.  Seating is uncomfortable  6ft 170 lb male. Very poor gas mileage around 20.  Buy a Honda Accord or a Ford 500/Taurus.  Soft suspension, vague handling.  Climate control is a real pain to work with,  requires constant attention.  Styling - misses the mark as compared to the others out there.  Quality - cheap plastic, noise, etc.  I rent cars almost every week as I travel, and get to drive SUV's, sedans, etc.  The Saturns are better than this.  How does GM get away with this trash?  Same as a Chevy Impala, at least it looks slight better.  "
buick,lacrosse,2008,StickWithFORD, 09/23/2010,Worst Investment I've ever made!!!!!,2,"This car has caused me nothing but problems. The day after driving it off the lot my ""service tires"" light came on. When I had it checked out at the dealersship I was told the pressure sensor was cracked. The dealership refused to pay for the repairs claiming it was my fault. The tires wear too easily due to the faulty rear struts. The car rattles horribly like its going to fall apart, the doors are 2 low, always hitting my head getting in. Now the car whines like a dying cat & I have gone from replacing fluid monthly to daily. The keyless entry hasnt worked since the 3rd month of me having the car. I see im not the only 1 with these issues. Entire car should be recalled. Back to Ford for me"
buick,lacrosse,2008,CB in Ohio, 09/22/2008,Best car for the dollar,4,"I drive a lot, 5600 in the past month and a half. The gas mileage is great for the size of car, avg. city/hwy now 26.4. Straight highway-no air on, I got 29.9 over several hundred miles through hilly terrain. I love the ride"
buick,lacrosse,2008,joe, 09/28/2008,Lexus at a Toyota price,4,Love my car. Rides smooth and is very quiet. Classy looking interior for the price.
buick,lacrosse,2008,jmcycle, 08/30/2009,Good for the Money,2,"Got the 08 CX new as a Company Car Good: Very supportive seats. A lot of standard features for base model. Bad: Fuel mileage is horrible. I'm lucky to get 24 highway and avg 16 city. My Honda Odyssey gets better mileage and it is taller, heavier, and has more hp. Driver seat started squeaking at 20k miles-I only weigh 185lbs. Brakes went at 20k miles- almost all highway. I've never had brakes go anywhere near that quickly. Steering wheel made a clicking sound- several dealers couldn't find the problem. Left windshield wiper splashes water on right side and right wiper missed it. key fob died-even after repl. btry. A lot of minor annoying problems that were expensive and inconvenient to fix"
buick,lacrosse,2008,Dave, 02/23/2008,Excellent Family Car,4,"We have about 2000 miles on it thus far. Our first Buick after years of only Japanese car purchases. We haven't been disappointed. The 2008 LaCrosse's redesigned front end reduces (or even eliminates) the ""grandparents' car"" look with a sleeker more attractive style. The comfort and convenience package is worth the price, which adds fold-down rear seats, heated front seats, and a few other amenities. Very nice. City mileage has averaged in the high teens or 20 mpg, and highway mileage in the 28-30 mpg range. The car rides smoother and quieter than any Camry/Altima we test drove, has great acceleration, and comes with many standard features you pay more for in the Japanese cars. "
buick,lacrosse,2008,NC, 05/27/2019,Do Not Buy,1,"My wife purchased a 2008 CX new from the dealer right around the time we first met.  Driven daily it now has 120K miles.  Alternator (failure, 2014), water pump (2019), power steering pump (2), steering rack (failure), front inner and outer tie rod ends (failure), front lower control arms (failure), ignition coils, ignition control module (failure, 2015), spark plug wires, spark plugs, headlight and taillight bulbs, rear section of fuel line (rusted and burst failure, 5/2019), tensioner pulley, warranty work at dealership for electrical work (required re-soldering of certain connections), fuel evap code resulting from vapor leak (wouldn't pass emissions in IL until fixed by dealer, 2017), engine oil weeping, low operating temp code, frozen rear brake calipers (2018), have all been problems with this vehicle: I'm sure there's more to add that I can't think of at the moment too.  The quality of the fabric in the cloth interior is horrendous, holding lint and hair like tape.  The ergonomics are atrocious too, entry and exit are difficult and interior space is small compared to the car's exterior dimensions.  Seating comfort is abysmal.  To provide context, I take good care of my vehicles and performed many of the parts replacements listed above.  Based upon my experience with this particular car, and on my 30 years of consumer experience with other GM models (1990 Grand Prix, 1988 Bonneville, 1996 Bonneville, 2000 Jimmy, 2000 Envoy, all of which were purchased new and had myriad problems as well) I will avoid GM products at all costs.  The GM loyalty instilled in me by my father has been obliterated by GM's continued failure to produce quality products.

buick,lacrosse,2008,Happy Buick, 02/15/2009,2nd One Owned,4,"Bought CXL last Jan. so after a year and about 6,000 miles, it is still a good car.  Bought a new CXS in 2005 and liked it so much, bought another one this past year.  On the strength side, I like the exterior and interior (dash) looks and its nice ride for these old bones.  On the negative side, the gas mileage is putrid at about 17 in town and 25 on the highway. Liked the Lucerne but felt it was too big. "
buick,lacrosse,2008,Louise Sabourin, 10/16/2007,Only 1600 miles and got problems,3,"My low oil level light came on and when I checked the oil it was only about a 1/4"" showing on the stick. Called the dealer and took it in and they said the 2008 seals were changed and that I needed to have them taken out and replaced because of the oil level dropping. So hopefully changing these seals will solve my problems and I can depend on it for years to come. "
buick,lacrosse,2008,Volvo Lover, 07/11/2008,I'm buying GM cars again!,4,"I am willing to bet that at 31, I am the youngest person to write a review on this car! LoL! My last vehicle was a Volvo S70, so don't think I am someone who blindly loves GM. When I heard Buick was #1 in reliability from JD Powers, I decided to check them out. It had everytihng I wanted; pleanty of options, under 25k, excellent record of reliability, V6 power, comfortable ride, etc. I was acutally looking at Volvo S40s and Audi A3s, but stopped by the Buick dealer on whim. Overall, the Buick had more HP and standard options than the others, but most importantly, it has a much better warranty! I liked the fact that Buick stands by their product for 100k miles! I am pleasently surprised!"
buick,lacrosse,2008,stimpy, 02/11/2009,dissappointed yet happy,4,"I wanted to get the CXL because of some features it had, but did not want leather seats.  So we had to get the CX in order to get cloth seats. Our 97 Century Limited had cloth seats (Buick let me down on this one). Mileage is dissappointing, 28 highway / 19 city.  Our old Century got 30+ highway.  But this LaCrosse is a very enjoyable and fun car to drive.  It is comfortable, pleasant to look at, and despite my dissappointment with the leather seat issue, a really nice car.  Guess we'll keep it til Buick comes up with one that will get 35 - 40 mpg! With the sleeker styling, I do keep brushing my head against the top of the door each time I get in."
buick,lacrosse,2008,stockee, 03/07/2008,Luxurious,4,"Very luxurious. From its smooth as butter ride, to its whisper quiet and powerful engine. Love the bench seat and useful column gearshift uses less space. Everything looks, feels, and sounds solid. From the solid slam of the door and feel of the column gearshift sliding through each gear. Love the midnight blue and soft beige leather"
buick,lacrosse,2008,Beverly Brown, 04/05/2008,How could we be more happy!,5,"Bought our car, in Flint, Michigan, left for our winter home in Arizona, and what a ride! We had forgotten how wonderful it is to drive and ride in a Buick. We took it in and got it all ""gussied, "" up and wow is it cute! It is not only pretty it is sharp! Added a sharp spoiler and now it's even more sharp. I get a kick out of tTger's commercial, ""a Buick was always a car for my parents age."" Well that fits us but this Buick of ours is not 1970!  It is a ride that has no competition, and the 2008 we purchased, more than surpasses any other car on the road. "

buick,lacrosse,2008,Paul Burton, 02/01/2018,Dependable Buick,5,"This car, a Buick LaCrosse CXL,  was bought new from the Buick dealer.  It has been used extensively for long trips of a thousand miles or more between Los Angeles, Idaho, and Washington.  It has presented no serious repair costs.  We maintain it well with required oil changes, proper tire pressure, recommended scheduled maintenance.  The air dam at the base of the windshield finally succumbed to the intense sun in Los Angeles and was just replaced in 2017.  The factory battery lasted over 9 years.  The original factory brakes lasted well past 52000 miles.  Replacing the brakes stopped some shuddering of the front end during hard breaking.  The shuddering did not interfere with the car stopping.  The brakes, factory originals and replacements, work very well.  Overall this has been a great car to own.  My wife and I are both 79 and we have owned many cars.  This Buick is clearly one of the best.

But the engine blew, so we decided to buy another used car. We looked at six different kinds of cars and SUVs. Not only did we tend to steer clear of other Buicks, just for a change, it didn't work. The minute my husband got behind the wheel, it was love at first sight/drive!!! Lol so in conclusion, we stayed with Buick because we knew we were getting a great car for the money.

buick,lacrosse,2008,Kabe, 01/30/2008,Luxury Car at a reasonable price,4,"At 1400 Miles so far I can honestly say I love my New Lacrosse. The LaCrosse CXL is very much a luxury car. Soft comfortable interior, very quiet on the road, lots of features, and a fantastic ride. Buick has firmed up the suspension from the LeSabres and it is a wonderful balance between good control and a smooth ride. No more floaty Buicks. I have had passengers comment that it rides as well as their much more expensive Audi. The 3.8L V6 provides ample pickup but is still quiet, and it should last a long time by reputation. It is a very enjoyable car to drive and well worth checking out. This car is not typical Buick of the past."
buick,lacrosse,2008,chinosteve, 06/14/2008,2008 Buick LaCrossse,4,I have owned Buicks for ten years (2000 Lucerne and current 2006 Lucerne CXL). Buicks have beed a preferred car in my family since 1935. The 2008 LaCrosse lives up to Buick's reputation for excellence in interior and exterior design. Handling is responsive (I have the optional ESC); performance is adequate; and interior road noise is minimal even at freeway speeds. Fit and finish is outstanding.
buick,lacrosse,2008,Joe, 07/03/2008,Great car,4,"I really enjoy this car, and I am 33. I had owned a 2006 Impala SS and had traded it after only 6 months because I averaged 22MPG. I then had a 2006 Grand Prix GT which was powerful, but had a stiff, uncomfortable ride. Every interior trim piece rattled. I just got this LaCrosse Super, and it is a major improvement over the Impala SS! Throttle response was tamed to you can ease away from stops. And, I am actually averaging 16MPG in the LaCrosse. Very quiet, great ride, and it handles very well for a Buick. Mine doesn't float and wallow and lean like other reviews have said.  I'm very happy with this car, and the Red Jewel Tintcoat is the perfect color for this car!"
buick,lacrosse,2008,Adria Pou, 09/20/2008,Love Buick LaCross 2008 and 2005,5,"Bought a beautiful red Buick LaCrosse Super 2008 a month ago and it's everything I could have wanted. Previously had a 2005 Buick LaCrosse 2005 which I traded in for this. The Super is slightly roomier with more bells and whistles, including ultrasonic rear parking assistance. Both cars perform well in both city and highway. The Super has a bigger engine than the CXL. My husband, who loves German cars, loved the CXL and loves the Super with its 8 cylinders even more. In short, I would buy both LaCrosse CXL and Super all over again. Also get many compliments on how beautiful the car is."
buick,lacrosse,2008,cherie, 10/20/2008,First time Buick owner,4,"I have has a Pontiac for the past 12 years. I absolutely love my LaCrosse. Just a few enhancements that would make it even better!  I think the passenger seat should be electric, just as the drivers seat is.  Climate control vents in the rear would alson be a great feature as well.  I know I make my right buying decision with the Buick. Thanks GM"
buick,lacrosse,2008,ray ham, 06/01/2009,Vibration,3,I read the reviews about the vibration. We took ours to a tire shop and they told us the vibration was due to the rear struts being out of line. We took it to the dealer and they put in some shims to align the rear. They also said it was due to a factory defect. However they didn't want to accept responsibility for the ruined tires. Hope this helps anyone else with vibration problems.
buick,lacrosse,2008,Allie, 01/01/2008,Great Car - Bad MPG,4,"I love the car's handling and the ride.  It's sharp and when I step on the gas pedal it is powerful.  A car you can get into trouble with on the highway very easily.  Great for long trip!  However, as others have said, it doesn't live up to the posted MPG.  I get 5 miles less in the city and 2 miles less on Hwy.  A real gas hog."
buick,lacrosse,2008,John, 08/29/2009,"agree with previous, but life after 50k",3,"I found myself agreeing with the previous reviews. A few things I found now that I have topped 50k, mostly highway miles. 1. had to replace both rear struts because ride became harsh. 2. drivers side door continues not to latch close, even after repeated lubrication. So, can I complain, when the car gives so much satisfaction?  Would like to see the 2010 re-model come as a Super edition.  Not sure if the 3.6L direct inject will satisfy not enough."

Only fault is door pillar trim starting to fade but dealer is going to replace.  Sometimes a ""grunt"" from steering when turning all the way left and dealer is watching this too before the warranty rus out. Now have 40,000 miles and still great driver.  This cart is different from 95% of the cars being reviewed on this page.  This is a super not cx, cl, cxl etc. So most of the reviews written here do nor reflect the lax super."

After owning a Olds Intrigue, I wanted to see what Buick had to offer. What a surprise. I loved my Lacrosse with the V-6. It had power, luxury and was so much better built than my Olds. I heard that Buick was going to build the Super, so I waited and bought the one off the showroom floor. I gave my CXS to my son,he loves it and he is 21. What a wonderful car!. Buick and GM have finally put together a complete package of power,luxury,value and overall satisfaction you will not regret. I find my Super to be smooth comfortable and fun to drive. I like it better than my Caddy STS.This is no old man car, I drive 140 miles a day."

That says it all."

We now draw straws to see who gets to drive the LaCross. The car has better response than our other Buick and handles much better. The trim and design are second to none. We looked at a Honda and were undecided until we drove both. No question the Buick is a better ride and feel. The mpg is excellent on the highway, 27.5mpg, not as good in town though. Worth a look and even more worth a test drive."

I have always been a Buick lover and I think Buick has outdone themselves on this one. Besides being very satisfied with it's handling, performance etc. I own a Red jewel Super with Cocoa interior.

buick,lacrosse,2008,Taylor, 08/28/2020,Avoid this rolling roadblock like the plague,1,"We bought our 2008 Buick LaCrosse for our college-age kids from a family member for under KBB value. They kept up with all the maintenance on it, and as it had only 104K mi on it, we thought we were getting a good deal. Fast forward 4 months, a couple thousand miles, plus a 900 mi trip home for our daughters' brief summer break. Just as we and many visiting family members leave for a non-refundable jet-boat trip an hour away in a caravan of vehicles, it starts spraying coolant. We limp it to our mechanic, where it requires nearly $2,000 in repairs. We thought we now had a vehicle that would last a long time. We were wrong. Because of the delay in getting back to school because of the repairs, we had to fly a daughter back so she wouldn't lose her job. My wife decided to accompany our other daughter back so she wouldn't be alone on the long trip across the desert. It's good she did. The car's next breakdown was in Winnemucca. This time it was about to throw a rod and would cost more to repair than it's worth. They then had to rent a U-Haul truck leaving the Buick behind. My wife then had to fly home. The tow company says they'll give us $500 in exchange for the title. I'm thinking we're going to cut our losses and go with it. So this cheap kids' car has ended up costing us thousands of dollars in purchase price, repairs, two plane tickets, U-Haul rental plus the additional fuel cost, and non-refundable tickets for a jet boat trip. And all this on a car that gave up the ghost after only 108,000 mi. I have bought Toyotas with 125K mi already on the odometer, then driven them another 150K mi without needing major repairs. I will never buy another General Motors product again."
buick,lacrosse,2009,Greg B., 08/29/2009,"Solid, Smooth, Quiet",4,"This is a vastly underrated car. It is very well-built, with excellent fit and finish, no rattles, and an incredibly quiet ride. It is a fabulous highway car. The 3800 V-6 works well and the ride and handling, while not a sportscar, is perfect for those who like their cars smooth and quiet. The leather seats with power lumbar adjustment are exceptionally comfortable. It has a huge trunk and 4 people can travel in comfort. I like the exterior styling, especially the side view thanks to the design of the greenhouse. People who criticize Buicks for being old persons cars really are missing the point. This is an excellent example of a traditional American car, smooth, quiet and comfortable."

After a massive number of complaints, Buick had no choice to post a recall notice. So even though officially recalled, Buick has not yet found a fix. The problem is where they located the relay box. It actually gets so hot that it melts down at which time you are left only with your high beams. ""GM Recall N 140291 issued 11/25/2014. Title: Low Beam Headlamp"". :Recall Status: Remedy Not Available as of 02/16 2015"". So why aren't dealers telling potential buyers about this??"
buick,lacrosse,2009,dave03886, 12/29/2012,very pleased with my car,4,"I bought this car last year with 96K miles for $9000, the car was driven by the owner of the dealership. And had been maintained very well. I had the evap sensor replaced and the ABS sensor repaired, 4 tires and front brakes, and regular oil changes. The ride is comfortable, and not sport handling at all, through very predictable road manners. fuel mileage is 18 town and 25 Highway.
The car also has side airbags. I have 120k miles on it now and expect to keep it awhile and put many more trouble free miles on it. The engine has a timing chain and not a belt, also the engine is 3.8 with the improved steel intake that prior GM had trouble with leaks. This was the last year for the new version."
buick,lacrosse,2009,Billee Scott Mick, 09/25/2015,electronic nightmare,5,"Spent 1300.00 to repair abs and traction control.  I don't think anything was wrong.  Sending unit is in wheel hub assembly and both had to be replaced. Two years later problem is happening again.  It will be a cold day in hell before I spend more money on this piece of crap.  Sad, Buick used to  be a decent car!  Why can't they get away from all the BS like ABS and traction control.  God how I miss crank  windows and keys that lock doors."

What a real difference in all aspects of quality. Great Car, love the way it handles, milage fantastic in the 3.8L engine. Highway averaging on a recent trip was 31.7 miles. Felt like I was in hog heaven thumbing my nose at gas stations. Car was very wisely priced  and worth the money. Used, but showroom quality inside and out. Recommend this car to anyone.

buick,lacrosse,2009,Hank, 06/19/2010,First Buick,4,"This is the first Buick I have ever bought, I traded in an Audi A4 for the Lacrosse CXL.  I really enjoy the bench seat in the front and gearshift on the column - it reminds me of the Olds Ninety-Eight my Dad took the family in on road trips.  The comfort is great and I have no problem with passing. The chassis could be a little stiffer around corners, but I have learned to love this comfortable, quiet American car.  I am planning a long road trip this autumn along the east coast with my two dogs - they love the big back seat."
buick,lacrosse,2009,John Haboustak, 03/20/2017,Good car,4,"This is my second 1st generation (05-09) Buick Lacrosse.
The 3.8 liter engine, reliability, and reasonable cost are good reasons to consider this as a used car.
I had some transmission issues with the 1st Lacrosse (hard shifts, failure to downshift) around 100k miles. Changing the fluid/filter cleared up the problems. I recommend changing the transmission fluid between 50k and 75k miles.
I had an ignition module go bad on both vehicles. This causes two cylinders to stop firing and driving for any distance will damage the catalytic converter. If your handy, this is an easy repair. The part costs about $125.

My purchase of the 09 LaCrosse was to replace my 01 Buick Park Ave, Ultra. At the time of purchase I tried both the Lucerne and the LaCrosse. I should have purchased the LuCernne. why? 1. Leather, very hard 2. Gas and heat gauge should be reversed 3.Heater and AC Controls( buttons) very poorly designed. 4. Headlight beam selector on the turn signal is a joke, more like an off and on switch. Also, turn signal indicator is much to loud. 5. Center Council is another poor design, unable to rest right elbow on it because it does not extend far enough forward. 6. Door pockets to shallow. "
buick,lacrosse,2009,Fred, 09/24/2009,Last of the great 3800 engines !!!,5,"Purchased this 2009 Buick Lacrosse in April 2009, after selling my great 2006 LaCrosse to a relative. This new vehicle proved to be as good as my older one. Only reason I bought in 2009 is to get the last of the 3800 engine. Newer engines might have more HP but are no more reliable than this last of a great breed. The vehicle is quite, responsive and very comfortable.  My only concern is the fact the battery ran completely down while sitting for 3 days. Dealer found no problem and it has not happened again. Still, there is the concern it might happen when I am a long way from home.  The 'antiquated' 4-speed transmission is smooth, responsive and gives as good a mileage as 6-speeds. "

buick,lacrosse,2010,David, 06/27/2016,Buick Lacrosse- A fancy name for LEMON,1,"This car is a hollow soulless plastic shell on an overpriced and underpowered piece of crap.     The car comes equipped with Tiptronic shifting.   However, having owned a Honda with tiptronic shift, this is more for show than actual delivery of performance.    At 22,000 miles, this car had sensor issues with the traction control, stabilitizer and the Emergency brake.   While driving the car, the sensors sent a slipping wheel message to the car and made the car go from 10 mph to 0 without warning.        There are 60 service bulletins about this car and 50 are related to the Traction Control and Parking Brake sensors being activated, however the GM garage was unable to fix the car in less than 4 weeks and they even tried to talk me into trading out of the car when it appeared they were unable to fix the car after 15 days.      Having owned a car with 195 HP and this one advertising 260 hp, this car is slow to accelerate and it seems kind of hollow without much power.     Had it been priced at $18,000 brand new and not $38,000 brand new it would have been more appropriate.

This is indeed a head turner and my family gets a kick out of watching people ogle the stylistic decor. In fact, just purchased a third car for my daughter today, and while not a LaCrosse, it was interesting to watch the sales staff walk around this car, as we stood by from afar, looking, pointing and talking amongst themselves. In fact, I requested the salesman not sell my car while I took his for a test drive! "

I drive a ton of freeway miles each year, i look for a comfortable car that above all is smooth and quiet. The Buick has managed to impress me on all fronts, a very solid car that has remained that way after 45k miles. It makes me feel good driving a American car again."
buick,lacrosse,2010,lph6402, 05/06/2012,Unresolved Noise on Startup,4,"Bought a new, fully loaded 2010 AWD in June, 2011. It always gets 'compliments' on the exterior styling. 

Unfortunately, I have an unresolved clanging or banging sound at startup.
The annoyance has been diagnosed from the beginning and the symptoms at startup last for 30~75 seconds.

It's loud, embarrasing and some type of manufacuring or assembly non-conformance. The local dealer has tried a few things with guidance from Buick service and engineers. 

Going on 9~10 months and Buick Customer Service basically told me to quick calling because they are not going to fix the non-conformance."
buick,lacrosse,2010,andrew_s1, 09/11/2012,Best of the best,5,"I am in my mid-20's and find this to be one great looking car!

buick,lacrosse,2010,Mark from Franklin, 01/22/2016,Loved it until...,3,"Overall the style, ride and comfort is awesome.  Then came the repairs!  It started with an issue regarding the sun roof.  Out of no where it would not fully close.  I noticed it on the highway at greater speeds than on city streets.  No leaks but whistling. Brought it to the dealer and they ""reset"" the computer stating it was misreading alignment in sensors.  Problem solved...sort of.  3 times this happened along with them reseating the entire sun roof unit.  It happened again after the reseating and then they stated the next try possibly costing me $$ because they needed to bring in a GM consultant at a cost.  After MANY back-and-forths we agreed to let him at least look at it before deciding on a course of action.  He said that they didn't follow the service bulletin properly and pointed out the instructions state to remove glass from frame BEFORE reseating sensors, aligning the frame then reinsert glass.  OOPS!  Can't make this up.  All is fine.

The above was not the ""car's"" fault but the stooges working on it.  The straw that broke the camel's back?  At 59K miles (still under warranty thankfully) it required a Catalytic Converter on Bank 1.  Here I am at 96K miles and I need the same Cat replaced and it is NOT under warranty!  $1K!

Also - Rear Hub & Bearing at 70K miles!, Front hub & Bearing at 80K miles, and the brakes seem to need replacement a whole lot more often than my Lincoln.  Going back to Lincoln...thanks for nothing Buick!

The Navi system is first-rate with high-def graphics lacking in other GM offerings.  I get lots of compliments at the gas station, in parking lots, etc.  Really a departure from the previous model they had out.  I am glad I gave this car a try, I love it!"

The LaCrosse has so many features the BMW didn't have. Living in the South, I like the remote start on hot days and the cooled seats and the rear sunshade. The interior is well designed and functional. I love the high tech ""gadgets"": the heads up display, the hard drive, the Nav display, the articulating headlights and so on. The exterior is just right. I have had more compliments on this car than any I've owned.

buick,lacrosse,2010,James L'Heureux, 06/22/2016,Thank God for an extended warranty,3,"I have owned my Buick Lacrosse CXS for three years. Purchased used with 55K miles. Day 5 had a warranty call for the navigation/radio, it would not maintain any saved information. Dealer replaced the raidio/nav system under extended warranty ($2800 out of pocket $100). A year after the replacement a recall came out on the radio/nav system (no return of money). Issue two, leaking oil from oil pan, oil pan replaced ($300 out of pocket $100)) covered under warranty, a year later same issue oil pan replaced another warranty call. Water pump replaced covered by warranty ($400 out of pocket $100)). Tire sensor replaced ($180 out of pocket $100)) warranty paid. Fuel sensor/actuator failed (warranty paid $50 out of pocket $100). Steering column failed replaced warranty paid $2,900 out of pocket $100. Transmission replaced at 110K warranty paid $4500 out pocket $100. Cracked rim $750 out of pocket. I love the car when it is running right but all of these fixes are a nuisance and I only have 4K left on the warranty scared I will start incurring these cost. Maintenance and warranty repairs in three years is approaching 10K. Looking to replace the vehicle for a more reliable with a lower cost on maintenance. 

Update 12/29/2018:
I still own the car and the warranty has expired, the final tally on the warranty was over $12K. In June the car decided to shut off while my wife was driving, check engine light came on and the ABS lights lite up. She lost all power to the car and was force to pull over. She gave me a call, I came out and the car started right up with the check engine light lite up. I drove the car directly to the dealership to see what the case was and how much it was going to cost. While waiting I look up to my car and found this was fairly common problem with this vehicle with the amount of mileage I had (130K) on the car. I was concerned since this was a huge safety issue and a recall had not occurred . One of the comments stated he called Buick and they covered 90% cost. So, what did I have to loose. I called Buick and after a day or so they covered 90% of the cost. Thank god because this repair was $1300.

Many people have complimented my car and I think many also like the fact that it's an American vehicle too.  When reviewing, take in consideration the model and also the wheels.  The CXS has the bigger V6 and the Touring package comes with 19"" tires which will give a more sportier AKA rougher ride.  The 18' wheels are chrome and don't look small at all.  I did NOT want the Touring package because I prefer the softer, quieter ride.  All upcoming cars will have bad blind spots because the new Fed rollover laws will mandate thick roof pillars.  "

Once that was fixed the electrical system started to go.

The exterior is very stylish, while the interior is clean and contemporary. The drive is quiet and incredibly smooth, slightly better than both the TSX & ES350 I test drove. Steering is responsive (especially in Sport mode) and acceleration is decent. IMO this is one of the best cars GM has ever produced, as the fit & finish of this vehicle is outstanding. Overall, I think the LaCrosse offers excellent value even fully-loaded, it's still reasonably priced compared to other vehicles in its class. So if you're in the market for a luxury sedan, you definitely should consider the Buick LaCrosse."

I bought the low end CXL, but it has everything I needed. Comfort and ride are exceptional, quietness is a joy. Reliability is still unknown, but highway miles are usually good for a car. I find the bluetooth actually works, the smaller stereo is just fine, and the interior lighting very relaxing. I can see where backup assistance could be valuable.

There is no real area to store coins, toll passes etc. Dangerous lack of space for gas pedal- right up against the console carpet- sometimes catch foot on brake pedal when letting off the gas.

buick,lacrosse,2010,j young, 08/22/2010,Issues with LaCrosse,2,"Agree with others, small trunk, visual impairments, however having issues with grinding noise turning steering wheel, a funny stuttering when stopping but not all the time, dealer couldnt find anything wrong but worried because none of this is normal with a new or even older car."

The new Lacrosse is a reflection of the German platform design team and the Chinese interior & onboard intelligent systems team inputs. The engine & 6-speed transmission, with available manual shifting provides 29 mpg at 75 mph. The fit & finish, leather seats and lighting are all spectacular. 18"" wheel option and H-arm rear provides great road manners and handling with triple seal doors resulting in QUIET RIDE. Stellar sales results are the consumers endorsement of the product. Great choice at a very competitive price point.   "
buick,lacrosse,2010,Mark , 10/14/2019,Ours has served us very well,5,"Our 2010 Buick Lacrosse CXL has been a fantastic car. We purchased it new and in the almost 10 years ownership, we have replaced 2 sets of tires, 1 battery, and a water pump. That's it! Still running fine on its original plugs and brakes. We are currently at 111K miles and are very pleased with this smooth, fine riding Buick. I'd def buy another one. :)

buick,lacrosse,2010,mcoleman22, 05/25/2012,Steering Issues,2,"After 5 attempts to fix the steering issues over 6 months, the Buick dealership has not been able to repair the defective steering issues. They have even brought in a GM Engineer with no success. They just keep asking for me to bring the back the car for another try - like a race pit stop. 
 
Since Buick has not admitted the problem cannot be fixed. I have sought help from the BBB Auto Line (http://www.bbb.org/us/auto-line-lemon-law/) . Based on the customer service that I have received from the Buick Warranty Department, I imagine that I will end up in court. I will be parking the car, so I do not go over the 50,000 warranty and buying a foreign car.

buick,lacrosse,2010,Tduke57, 09/20/2010,New class of world class? Not,3,Update of an earlier review. Driving my 2010 CXS to work today w/just 3400+ miles and just shy of 4 mo's ownership the car died at a traffic light.  All electronics worked but the engine was totally dead and would not even attempt a re-start.  Had to get towed by the dealer (Buick Roadside tried to send me to a dealer that was no longer a Buick dealer) and after a day of having it don't seem to have much of an answer.  Despite months of research and reservations about picking a new model year car I seem to have made a mistake.
buick,lacrosse,2010,fastphil, 09/20/2009,too much like your farther's Buick,3,"manual shift on transmission is BAD; performance is weak at best; passing on 2 lane road and the damn thing up shifts at 4500 when the pedal is still to the metal; manual up shifts are so slow that you have to begin the process at 5000 otherwise it will dump you into the dreaded ""overspeed"" shutoff of any and all power; cannot imagine what a twisty road would be like in this unit, even if one petal to the metal it is like the Buick field mice have a conference to see if and when it might happen"
buick,lacrosse,2010,Robert steinlauf, 10/17/2009,The End of an Affair,5,My 40 year affair with Cadillacs ended with my purchase of the 2010 Buick Lacrosse. The car is proof that Government Motors can build fine cars that are fully competitive with Europe and Asia. The first day I drove the car I came out of a supermarket and found a young couple busy photographing my silver gray CXL. the styling of the car is so fresh that it is a pleasure to look at. The chrome hubcaps are beautifully designed . The sunroof is large and well integrated into the interior roof. I found the ride at 70mph on the interstate to be most comfortable. Around town it's fun to drive.
buick,lacrosse,2010,Austin, 10/27/2009,My Last Buick,3,"I had rave reviews for this car when I first bought it. That has changed after a month of ownership.  I will start off by saying that this car would be owned by Buick right now, if I was not pressured into taking $500 to waive the 60 day buy back program. Two days after I bought the car it started pulling to the left. The dealership in Delaware OH) said they didn't have the equipment and told me to try back in a few weeks. The dealership then refused to return any calls.  Another dealership tried to fix the pulling and have not been successful.  Now the Sunroof doesn't work and the sun shade works when it feels like it. And they won't buy it back! Thanks GM-you lost 1 more."
buick,lacrosse,2010,Greg Williams, 11/08/2009,The whole package at a great price,5,"Just took delivery of my carbon black CXS with chrome plated wheels and I love it.  I'm a former Infiniti and BMW owner and I can tell you that the handling and suspension are very solid, even better than I anticipated.  The 3.6L engine has plenty of pep and I have found the shifting to be smooth. The seats are very comfortable and the quality of the leather is excellent. If you are into high tech, you will love the entertainment and nav system, blue- tooth entry, remote start, back up camera, and hands-free calling. I also ordered the heads up display, which is one of my favorite features and is completely adjustable in location, intensity, and screen features. "
buick,lacrosse,2010,Steve, 11/18/2009,"It's not my Dad's Buick, IT'S MINE......",5,"I recently purchased a 2010 Lacrosse after driving a VW Touareg for the last 5 years, the Touareg finally got the best of my bank account. The Lacrosse is the most comfortable vehicle that I've owned and those cars have included Audi, Pontiac, Honda, Isuzu and BMW. This car has already been a really enjoyment in so many ways. So far my MPG has been above 23, the performance of the 3.6 V6 is fantastic and I haven't found anything that I haven't liked. If your in the market for a new sedan stop into your local Buick dealer, it will be well worth your trip."
buick,lacrosse,2010,Lacrosse AWD, 11/17/2009,A work of art,4,"This car is a work of art. I truly mean that. Example: I don't know if this was the plan but it seems the Buick waterfall theme (Grill) is carried over to the center stack. The buttons under the Nav are curved and the center stack flows gently down the center console. You can almost picture running water. I have never seen such attention to detail. And the fit and finish is awe inspiring. As I researched the car I noted my Lacrosse AWD was made by the same company that makes the million dollar Bugatti Veyron's AWD. The exact same one as in the Saab turbo. Fully loaded at 38,000 I feel like I truly got my moneys worth. How many people can say that?"

I bought CXL FWD with luxury package and head up displace.  Its seats are comfortable, ton of luxury features, smooth drive, beautiful exterior and interior designs, smooth drive, quite, still in break in period so I am not pushing gas pedal much, but its engine appears strong enough for acceleration and till maintain smooth drive.  The rear windows are somewhat small, so kind of difficult to turn back and see other cars when passing lane or when back up, but will be used to with it"
buick,lacrosse,2010,Mike, 04/18/2010,BuickIsBack!,5,Went to our local Lexus dealer to look at the new models and left unimpressed. Way overpriced and nothing really that special - the interior in the ES looked worse than a Camry's. We thought we'd take a look at this new Buick given all the recent hype and we were just floored. The interior makes you feel pampered and the exterior beautiful. Best of all it is priced just right. Coming from someone who has driven nothing but imports and saying this beats a Lexus is a huge testament to how quickly American cars are improving. 
buick,lacrosse,2010,lovesred, 07/06/2010,A few quirks,4,"I've had my LaCrosse for about two weeks now. It's beautiful and runs great, but I do think the car has a few design flaws. The pillars, side view mirrors and the small rear window make it VERY hard to see. When I'm driving fast and changing lanes on the highway I feel like I'm taking my life in my own hands. The armrests are poorly designed, and the door handles are awkward. I don't think the seats are very comfortable. There is very little interior storage-the door pockets are virtually useless. The electronic door lock buttons are on the center console, not on the doors, which is confusing for guests. Even when accelerating smoothly the car often hesitates as it changes gears."
buick,lacrosse,2010,Pam, 07/16/2010,Awesome car to drive,4,"Just purchased this beauty on 7/10;so far so good.  I test drove the Maxima, Altima, and Taurus.  I just kept coming back to the Lacrosse.  It was hard to find the red, with the titanium interior and accessories that I was looking for but finally I did (had to travel to another state) I have had two people stop me so far to comment on the car.  I believe it is due to the red exterior and chrome wheels. Runs very quietly and smoothly."

I looked at many cars such as Lexus, Mercedes, Acura, etc. but after several months of test drives and reviews I felt that the Buick LaCrosse had the best overall formula for being the winner & best value.  I really like its styling and the new suspension with the 3.6 liter engine makes it a sporty car for its size.  Its very quiet, steering is great, and it has a nice road feel versus the older Buicks mushy ride.  The Sound system is great.  I'd rate it equal to the Bose system in my last car.  The only thing I would recommend to change would be for more storage space for odds and ends such my phone,coins, et"

buick,lacrosse,2010,John Coccio, 09/28/2009,The Buick of Automobiles,4,"Well, after a month I must say this is one fantastic car. People are raving about it's good looks. Family members who drive imports say ""THAT'S a BUICK??? Well, it's about time"" That may be an indictment to GM recent past as a ""car"" maker, but this car has arrived.  While there is road noise from under the car, it is generally quiet, the nav system works great, back up camera makes backing silly easy. Everyone who rides in back raves how comfortable it is. You can feel the bumps in the road, but it isn't a jarring feel.  As far as handling, this car stays planted around corners, which says something for a 4000 pound plus car."
buick,lacrosse,2010,buickowner, 04/24/2010,Don't like my 2010 LaCrosse,3,"After two months, I like my new LaCrosse less every day.  Visibility is poor.  Hard to judge front end when parking.  Gas pedal to close to floor console causes you to hit your foot every time you hit the gas pedal. Cramped space for driver.  Door armrests too narrow to comfortably rest your left arm.  Awkward center arm rest is not located to allow comfort rest of your right arm.  Switch for sunroof already not working. Trunk space is small and hard to fit a set of golf clubs. I had a Buick Lucerne and loved it...don't like the new LaCrosse...This car is being touted as a Lexus alternative.  If I wanted a Lexus I would have bought one...I wanted a Buick. "

This car holds the pavement excellently, The seats are VERY comfortable, all the controls are plainly labeled and easy to use, which makes the touch screen very easy to use. Car is very quiet, but the Goodyear Eagles aren't, transmitting road noise to the cabin from the pavement.   All the materials in and on the car are top notch, and have a high quality feel to them."
buick,lacrosse,2010,tracy, 03/16/2016,I like my car,4,"This car is great with two kids. No problem or issues of space and maneuvering around within the car. I'm not a fan of the 2 blind spots off the front 2 corners of the vehicle but I have adjusted. The only other problem is that it feels like the transmission skips once in awhile. I believe that is what the recall is for. I just haven't got it in. I've owned the car 5 years' I bought it used it was a rental vehicle. I never use the triptonic feature, I think it's a silly feature and it's just something else to break.

buick,lacrosse,2010,andylibby, 08/31/2009,"Not greatness, but close enough.",4,The 2010 Buick Lacrosse is a big step forward for GM and American cars in general.  The price is remarkably reasonable.  The drive and ride is solid and predictable. The seats are supportive and wrap comfortably to hold the driver and front passenger firmly in place. The cabin is both sumptuous and functional and shelters its occupants from the elements while giving the driver plenty of feedback from the road.  Steering is precise and almost nimble.  The brakes are very strong and consistent.  Rear seat legroom and seating is spacious and utterly comfortable. Trunk space is very good with low lift-over and wide access. Throw in fold down rear seats and you've got a lot of versatility.  
buick,lacrosse,2010,1st Time Buick Owner, 09/13/2009,2010 LaCrosse 3liter cxl,4,This is an impressive auto and in my area it was only appx $4K more than the Accords and even closer in price to the new Malibus list so I got the Buick. Insurance same as the Malibu. Appears large on the inside but sporty and stylish on the outside. This is due to the small trunk which some have panned but which I think was wise. Ext dim is somewhat wide and you sit tall (if desired). The steering is very responsive and smooth. The acceleration is not linear or quick. It's slow at first (weight?) but will then kick in. Eventual high speed very easy. Everything seems very tight and made of quality. Currently 17.7 mpg mixed. Back seat is too large for me. Rear auto sun screen is nice.

The new exterior/interior design puts this car in the Acura and Lexus class with a Buick price. It does cost a couple of thousand more than the Accord, but the quality of the materials (the leather seats are plush) and the ride quality make it well worth the price difference. Plus you get the Cadillac warranty (5 yrs, 50,000 miles - including tires). In our area these cars are hard to find and the dealers are not coming off the MSRP. This is the first car to bring me back to GM in almost almost 15 years. Now improve the rest of the fleet - Please! "

The engine could use a bit more power. Fuel economy is good too for a 3.6. The ride is very smooth, but not wallowing. The transmission needs to be improved though. It's only the downshifts, which come to slow. But it shifts very smoothly. And it's a good value too"
buick,lacrosse,2010,Heidi, 10/16/2009,Fantastic!,4,"I traded in my 2009 Toyota Venza after only 2800 miles on it for this.  That car was starting to have squeeks and terrible rattling noise coming from the dash.  My husband drives the 2006 Lucerne which is fantastic as well, the LaCrosse is just the little sporter version.  Very happy with the ""quietness"" and wonderful ride.  Good handeling and styling. Great quality, you get a lot more for your money with Buick products and luxury.  We used to be Toyota and Honda buyers, have learned quickly about the quality and luxury Buick has to offer with a MUCH MORE superior product!  Love it! Can't go wrong with either the Lucerne or LaCrosse!"

The styling of the exterior and interior is absolutely beautiful.  The quality of the interior materials and the layout is top notch.  The exterior can easily be mistaken for cars costing twice as much.  The power, for me, is sufficient and the ride is extremely compliant.  Interior noise is almost non-existent. This truly is not your grandfather or fathers Buick."

The interior is on par with any Acura TL or Lexus ES and the rear seat blows both away. There wasn't a hint of cost cutting inside the car and every surface and control knob felt substantial. The 3L engine felt adequate during the test drive.

The ride is very smooth and the red is an eye catcher. Never been stop by some many people and they say it's a Buick...yes.  Caviar taste w/a good price $35,580.  My wife had people pulling her over on the road asking about it.  The car is very responsive and to me it's fast when needed, I don't need to dragster, just get up and go when it's necessary.  "

As soon as we laid eyes on the interior of this car we were incredibly surprised at the level of beauty, quality and fit/finish. Could not believe this was a Buick.

So far so good. The car is a rocket ship in every sense, fast with lots of buttons and technology to support the rocket ship experience.  Note: I don't think one can compare a CX to the CXS, its  Night and day. To truly enjoy this car you need to move up to the CXS or at a minimum the CXL. And even, it's noon and sunset for the CXL and CXS. I'll let you decide who gets to be sunset. Spend the extra $$."

It is a great car and in my opinion, a very big bargain at MSRP, yet alone what I was able to buy mine for. Also, with the help of a great GM dealer, I was able to cash in on some not very well known rebates and get great financing, which I could not get on my own.  Yes, the car is is not perfect as there are minor storage and convenience issues, as well as marginal 0-60 performance times. However, what it does well, it does better than any other car I've driven. It is the most comfortable, best riding and best handling sedan I've ever been in and I've been in a bunch.

Low RPMS at 65 mpg.  This car is very quiet. I can't believe it's running when at a stop light. The A frame supports in the front have been getting a bad rap, I personally don't notice them and have had no trouble seeing anything while driving.

Very quiet with no wind noise. More of a firm ride for a Buick, but very acceptable. The seats are very comfortable. Got 27 MPG on first road trip. The 3.0 V6 provides sufficient power. The interior space is layed out nicely. I can't wait until it gets dark outside to view the ambient blue lighting along the dashboard and throughout the interior of the vehicle.

This is a company car for me, so I'm not assessing a purchase...I'm just offering some honest feedback from my first week.  Overall, I love the car!  Looks, feels, and sounds just like a previous Lexus I owned.  But if I was spending my own money, I'd still buy the Lexus ES350 because it all comes down to two things for me:  1. Reliability (which the jury is still out on the new LaCrosse), and 2. resale value.  Lexus has both...GM has neither.  However, I want to see GM succeed, so I hope the LaCrosse is the first step to many prosperous years for GM.  Build quality cars and and people will come back."

This vehicle drives smooth yet sporty and has every feature imaginable. The great styling makes the Lexus look more like a (old)buick. This car is my favorite of over ten different vehicles owned
buick,lacrosse,2010,bossyone, 01/19/2010,A head turner,4,"I purchased my jewel red Lacrosse in December. I like the car inside and out. It has enough room for me and my family, I like the sporty look and the comfortable ride. Buick, you outdid yourselves on this one. Run for cover Lexus!"
buick,lacrosse,2010,RJP, 01/16/2010,Lacrosse takes the Cake!,5,"Lacrosee is a great vehicle!  Looked at many and only stopped by the Buick dealer to check it out after viewing an ad on TV and looking at some on-line reviews; perhaps interestingly was on my way to re-visit the Jag dealer when I literally dragged my wife and daughter into the Buick Dealership; I had checked a number of other cars including the Jag, Audi, Lexus and Acura, along with Volkwagen and the Chevy Malibu, to name a few.  Overall, the Lacrosse beat all hands down, especially in terms of the 'bang for the buck'!"
buick,lacrosse,2010,Dick, 01/24/2010,Great NEW American Car,5,"Traded in a 2005 Cadillac STS with Northstar V8 and a $58k sticker.  My new 2010 LaCrosse CSX is $20k less and every bit as good with better build quality and, option-for-option, the better of the two.  Really, really nice outside and inside--better than BMW (3 or 5), Acura and Lexus (GS or ES). ONLY complaint is no all-wheel drive on CSX model--don't understand.  Can highly recommend this car--way to go Buick and GM!!"
buick,lacrosse,2010,Motor Head, 01/30/2010,Wow is this car Quiet!,4,"After three months and 5000 miles our white diamond 2010 LaCrosse CSX has been flawless. We average 24 - 25 mpg in mixed winter driving. Optioned with the sunroof & nav system with rear view camera. The 3.6L engine has plenty of pep while very smooth and quiet. In this cold winter weather we love the remote start, heated seats & steering wheel. The interior is luxurious and the seats are very comfortable. Rear visibility is poor, but not a problem with the camera and ultrasonic parking assist. The front roof pillars are somewhat wide and placed more forward and do sometimes obstruct my view when turning. Bottom line - there is alot to like about this car. I would definitely buy it again."
buick,lacrosse,2010,Scott Smith, 02/01/2010,Great looking car with some minor issues,4,"Instead of commenting on the beautiful looks and amazing ride, I will list some negatives:  - Blind spot on the left and right side of the front windshield.  - Gas pedal literally up against the right side floor wall. It's impossible to step on the pedal without foot scraping up against that carpeted wall.  - Power outlet INSIDE the center armrest console means you can't use a GPS device AND have the center console closed unless you want to squish the charger cable.  - Almost NO storage space.  - No auto windshield wiper shutoff. If you forget to turn them off when you shut car off, they stop where they are at that moment. A $30k car should have this. Each of my previous three cars did."
buick,lacrosse,2010,mario, 02/02/2010,Love it so far,5,"I've only had the car for a few days, but so far it is everything I had hoped.  It is a great driver experience - the cabin/dash is well laid out and very comfortable.  Ride is smooth and quite.  Engine has the kick I need.  It is a softer ride (but not as soft as the riding-on-a-cloud buicks of past), which may not be for some.  The mileage isn't great so far (low 20's after a highway trip), but what I expected.   Overall though, I am very happy with it."
buick,lacrosse,2010,2intoit2, 02/04/2010,edmonds needs to do more research,5,"I find that the Buick LaCross is more than just a ""car"", it is a true pleasure to drive and experience."
buick,lacrosse,2010,jbprice92, 02/17/2010,This aint your daddy's Buick!,4,"Wow!  I have had 10 cars in my life and only one did I love--a Mazda Millenia--this blows it out of the water.  My husband and I went to the car show to look at cars--I was set on another Mazda until I saw the interior of this car.  It is unreal.  Beautiful and elegant and Oh what a ride!!  I am 45 and feared the stigma of the ""old person"" Buick--but I got over that very quickly.  I can't wait to get in this car and drive it.  It is simply amazing.  I compared it to the Lexus and it didn't even come close!  If you are considering other models--go look at the interior of this car and then drive it.  I guarantee it will blow you away.  "
buick,lacrosse,2010,Steve, 03/03/2010,Overall outstanding car with few flaws,4,"I'll sum up the good points first:  1) Style: This car looks better than a lexus, mercedes, audi, or bmw. Hands down.  2) Interior style: I love the accent lighting, the displays, the information center with radio  3) I love the bluetooth for cell phones. Totally worth it don't skip it. Trust me.  4) Engine: I love the power and the auto-stick feature. Fun!  What I don't like:  1) Drivers seat is not deep enough. It also has a hard plastic portion that sticks out. You'll bruise your thigh getting in an out if not careful. I learned the hard way.  2) Small trunk  3) USB/Power outlet in center console  4) Gas tank on wrong side (can be good for busy gas stations)"
buick,lacrosse,2010,MR BUICK, 03/13/2010,Awesome,4,"I have driven a lot of nice vehicles in my life, but the LaCrosse outshines them all. I have been stopped many times asking if this was a Buick. Great in bad weather (did wonderful in the snow) and comfort to spare. How quiet it is will blow you away. Do yourself a favor and get one. "
buick,lacrosse,2010,shkspier, 03/05/2010,Look out Lexus!,4,"I've only had my car for a few weeks but am LOVING it.  I'm a youthful 43 year old man and never thought I'd own a Buick.  This vehicle oozes class, style and performance, all for about $10K less than a Lexus.  The ride is comfortable, but tight -- nothing like the ""marshmallow"" suspension I've always associated with Buicks.  A bit nervous about the reliability of a GM but willing to give it a shot with the new upgraded warranty (finally).  I've always owned Toyotas, Lexus, etc but glad to say I own an American vehicle now.  "
buick,lacrosse,2010,Tom, 03/12/2010,Great Car,5,"Quiet and comfortable. Locks out road noise. In my opinion, ride is on par with Lexis 350. Ambient (Ice Blue) lighting is great. Controls easy to use. Seats are comfortable, not tired after long drives. Overall, Looks like Buick got it right with the Lacrosse."
buick,lacrosse,2010,Josephine, 03/18/2010,Decent car but there are better options,3,"Was a loyal Toyota fan. I needed to replace my Avalon for 2010. I bought this car through the suggestion of a friend that loved this new car. Overall, I can't say I'm displeased, but I should have looked at more options. The drive is kind of uninspiring, in traffic. I don't feel that there is enough steering feel as well as engine power to drive safely in this crowded area of Los Angeles"
buick,lacrosse,2010,dc, 03/24/2010,Beautiful Car - Wish I Could Drive It,4,"This is an absolutely gorgeous car.  I also own a Lexus ES350 and I am still undecided which is better from a design perspective.  From a quality and reliability perspective Lexus beats this car and GM hands down.  I purchased the CXS just over a week ago and I have only been able to drive it three times.  The rest of the time it has been at the dealership.  After purchase, I  was not on the road for 5 minutes  when I started getting warning messages.  The dealer now informs me that the computer is bad so I have not been able to drive the car.  I wish they could fix this problem right away because as I said it is a dream to drive and the G6 I have as a loaner is very disappointing. "
buick,lacrosse,2010,doc15, 03/23/2010,Great Car,5,If you're looking for quiet and comfort the Lacrosse has it. Outstanding ride. Shuts out outside noise and bumps. Have receive many compliments on its looks on the street. Not tiring after long drives. Back seats very comfortable for adults. I would recommend this car if style and comfort are your main objectives.  
buick,lacrosse,2010,Sammy, 03/28/2010,"Sensible car, not a sport sedan",4,"I've had my Buick LaCrosse for a week. I traded my 2002 LeSabre with 170K for it. I was wowed by the styling and had admired other Lacrosses on the road. The interior is gorgeous. The ambient lighting is very cool. The seats are blissfully comfortable-- best yet. Plus it has a pheromone that is a real turn-on--it smells amazing! As cool as this car looks and feels, though, it is not a sport sedan. If you want a sport sedan, spend the extra bucks and buy a CTS, or at the very least, a CXS with the 3.6. The engine is too small for such a big car. The transmission downshifts way too often on the highway, and the fuel economy is rotten. I got 28- 30 hwy with the LeSabre. So far, getting 23 w/Lcrs."
buick,lacrosse,2010,A. Junior, 03/28/2010,Excellent Car,4,"I am really happy with my purchase. Very fast car, very stable, very quiet.  It's a turning head car, maybe cause it's new, but, all I can say is I loved it."
buick,lacrosse,2010,IronDome, 04/09/2010,Memory Seats a Drag,4,I couldn't wait to get rid of my Acura RDX for the LaCrosse.  Styling is fantastic. Ride is great.  Car is very quiet. Gas mileage as billed.  No funny stuff there.  Recently took it on a 1500 mile trip to home town.  Normally I am worn out by the drive but not this time.  It was a pleasure to drive.  
buick,lacrosse,2010,BuickEnthusiast, 04/16/2010,I adore this car!,4,"I was initially nervous about buying a car after having trucks and SUVs for the last 12 years, but this car impresses me more and more as I drive it.  Lots of fun, and it's amazing to corner, with the adaptive suspension.  The 3.6 liter V6 is sporty, and yes, I have won some stop light drags!  I have had zero issues with it, and have really enjoyed the Bluetooth, hard drive and sunroof.  I get tons of compliments on it, lots of people are surprised it's a Buick.  "
buick,lacrosse,2010,bt06, 04/22/2010,Love My LaCrosse,4,"This vehicle is all it's advertised to be.  Great styling, comfortable roomy interior, and good performance.  The ride is super smooth almost as if your on a cloud.  My gas mileage is still improving which is a major plus.  When I bought I was at 17.1 mpg, now almost two months later I'm at 18.4 (and still appear to be climbing).  The biggest surprise to me was the room in the back.  In previous vehicles I could not fit an adult or older child behind my seat.  In the Lacrosse I have a ton of room back there."

It has: ""Heads- Up"" Display (also avail. on Corvette and Cadillac STS). Listen to Harmon Karden's 5.1 Martix Dolby Sound thru 11 speakers with USB, I-Pod, and power outlets. The Navigation system is coupled to BlueTooth, a Rear-View Camera with Audio Warning & Layout Grid. Blind-Spot indicating rear-view mirrors, that light up the driveway, blink & tilt and can be folded in. No key, just a Buick transponder. 19 inch wheels bring a customized H-Arm suspension upgrade on the CXS and a custom rear-spoiler is available. The Blue Ambient Lighting in the interior is world class. Road noise is ""unheard- of"" Best Car for 40K? Yep! GB"
buick,lacrosse,2010,Sgm9, 04/22/2010,New owner,5,I've had the car for 5 months now and it's fun to drive.  I always have to answer questions about it from strangers who see it.
buick,lacrosse,2010,keith, 05/01/2010,really nice ride - goodbye cadillac!,5,"Had 8 cadi; s before this one, cts, dts, while its does quite get to a cadi, its almost there, worth every Penny without the additional cost of the cadi name!  Smooth, really quiet inside, v-6 is perfect, stereo, seats are sumptuous, really has an updated look and feel, inside and out!  Great mileage as well."
buick,lacrosse,2010,mobo, 05/16/2010,Who Designed the Interior?,3,"There is no ""inner beauty"" to this car. Exterior is an eye catcher but the design inside is really poor.  The arm rests are too narrow; middle console has no space for arm rest for driver and if you put a bottle in the console you must rest your arm ON the bottle!; the location and design to close the door is goofy. Here is the clincher - both my husband and I constantly hit our knee getting in and out of this car - it was crazy and really annoying.  We are not big people - he is 5'10"" and 160 and I am 5'7"" at 130.  Taller and heavier people should be forwarned - expect to have knee surgery after getting in and out of this car."
buick,lacrosse,2010,Robert, 05/17/2010,2010 Lacrosse CXS,3,"Wife liked the car via the ads and it was her turn to pick, I orginally did not like the car because of the engine, My rental had the 3.0 that seemed underpowered for the weight it was pushing so I quickly dismissed it till it was time to purchase a new car. After a little research I found that I could get a lot of the what the CTS had for less money with extra space for my rear passengers. Satisfied with the car to date with the exception of the small trunk, No power outlet up front, Closest one is in the center console."
buick,lacrosse,2010,Joe, 05/25/2010,"It is a "" SHOW STOPPER """,4,"I just love everything about it. The outside look. The beautiful interior. I can live with the visibility issue, due to low sleek look. It is so much fun to drive, you listen to the Harmon Kardon stereo, the hard drive music box and you can drive forever. I have been stopped six or seven times by people who want to know, what brand car it is. They love it! I looked long and hard, and there is no other car that delivers so much at a reasonable price. This is my first AMERICAN car in 18 years, and it is as good or better than anything I have had before. I got mine in the tricoat diamond white with chrome wheels and it is a "" SHOW STOPPER."""
buick,lacrosse,2010,John, 06/01/2010,Not pleased,3,"After 2 months of ownership, I am not completely satisfied with this car. Steering wheel needed to be replaced due to bumps all over leather. Metal trim near rear-quarter fixed window began separating and needed to be replaced. Center stack and console are a constant source of loud rattles and cracking noises, enough to drive you mad. Dealership has been accommodating in trying to fix this. However these noises just won't seem to go away. Mechanically there have been no problems (knock on wood). But these issues have made it very difficult for me to enjoy this car."
buick,lacrosse,2010,commish, 06/05/2010,Lovin' it!,4,"Have had my CXS for 10 weeks and I fall more in love everyday.  I love driving this beast.  It is responsive, cushy inside and I always get comments from strangers who like the way it looks.  Just came back from a 2000 mile road trip and I have no complaints about the performance.  I love driving it at night!  The interior ambient lighting is calming and beautiful. The ride is awesome.  My previous car was an Mercedes E class.  I was never as excited about driving it as I get when I take out my LaCrosse.  "
buick,lacrosse,2010,Ron, 06/07/2010,As Advertised and More!,4,"This car met and exceeded my expectations! There were features that I didn't expect (tilt mirrors, press to open trunk, full folding rear seat back, auto heat/cool seats w/remote start, etc.). This car has more bells and whistles that any other car around!  Not only that, it is a VERY comfortable and quiet car. My wife loves how the seats wrap around more than on her Mercedes. First time with OnStar and very impressed! I'm OK with the fuel cap on the right side! Ambient lighting really looks great at night. Everyone comments on it. Voice activation for nav system could be a little more intuitive! Sometimes need to try 3 or 4 times to get the right phrase.  Most issues are minor, love the car!"
buick,lacrosse,2010,Davis, 06/06/2010,Buick Hits a Home Run,5,"This car is a pure joy to drive and ride in.  It has very good acceleration and corners like it is on rails.  I haven't discovered much real use for the sport mode yet, but it is fun to drive in that mode.  We couldn't find one thing wrong after several thorough inspections. Fit and finish are as good as possible.      In the rear seat the car feels like a much larger car.  We traded a 2005 LeSabre for this, and we don't feel one bit cramped in the back seat of the Lacrosse.  A great creature comfort I haven't read in any professional review is -  when the key fob is close to the locked vehicle, it can be unlocked by opening the door handle. What is the use of Lexus now?"
buick,lacrosse,2010,dave1020, 06/09/2010,LaCrosse is the car,4,"Recent purchase after leasing a loaded Saturn Aura for 3 years. Wanted Mercedes, but too rich for us. Test drove Ford Taurus, Mercury Milan, Mazda 6, Honda Accord, Lincoln Z, and 2008 Mercedes (used, low mileage). Then stopped by Buick and saw Red Jewel Tintcoat with exceptional lines and a cocoa/light cashmere sleek interior. Has comfort package #2 and Entertainment Package with Nav, Backup camera, Blind spot and oversized sunroof. Test drove with my wife. Got out and shut the door - sounded like door closing on a tight seal refrig. Extremely quiet riding and has all the power we need. Fantastic so far and got a good price too."
buick,lacrosse,2010,Love this car, 06/27/2010,Love this car,4,"After 25 years of Mitsubishi ownership I am finally the owner of an American car and I LOVE it. I truthfully cannot say anything negative about it. Build quality is excellent, styling is fantastic and performance is wonderful. If there is anything less than great it would be the rear window, which could be somewhat larger, but I realize that the trunk opening would have to be lower. On my first drive to the Southern California desert it performed very well on the mountain roads. The On-Star system performed flawlessly and the side mirror radar display is a great help on our busy freeways. Very quiet even at high speeds. Like I said, I cannot think of anything negative. GREAT CAR!"
buick,lacrosse,2010,Kansashoops1, 06/27/2010,Great Ride!,4,Just got this vehicle about a week ago. Getting lots of looks going down the highway and had several folks stop and ask us what the vehicle was all about. Really like it for the most part. Also tried out a Ford Taurus 2010. Seemed like it had a little more power but not nearly the features of this car. Great value for the money.
buick,lacrosse,2010,Tom D., 07/02/2010,LaCrosse CXS- New Class of World Class?,4,"This is a beautiful car; the exterior design with 19"" wheel touring package is striking.  Inside is magnificently appointed and the 11 speaker Harmon- Kardon audio system is superb.  GM is proud of their collaboration with the Chinese in it's design and building a true Lexus competitor.  Then you open the trunk; which looks like they collaborated with the old Soviet block.  Is that imitation rat fur?  What's up with those hinges? Steering wheel 5 degrees off-center and a couple bogus service messages for suspension system- new model gremlins no doubt. Clearly though, this car is a huge improvement over any GM car I've ever owned."
buick,lacrosse,2010,Crystal River John, 07/06/2010,Wonderful car,5,"My wife's new LaCrosse is one of the best cars I have ever driven..it is so quiet, that you have to check the tach to see if it is running!!  With only 6000 miles on odometer, gas mileage on Interstate driving is right at 27 mpg.  Comfortable seating, and rear leg room galore!  I will consider leaving Cadillac when my lease is up in May, to buy MYSELF a new LaCrosse!!"
buick,lacrosse,2010,meekochu, 07/05/2010,It should have been a cadilac,5,"I just dropped off my STS after completing my lease.  I test drove the CTS and it was rough.  The salesman talked me into driving the Lacrosse.  It was love..  This car should be a Cadillac.  I got the loaded CXS for about 38,000.  The loaded CTS was almost 52,000 and it rode like a covered wagon.  I love this car, it turns heads daily, the ride is beyond compare.  If you get one, you must have the backup cameras, they are awesome."
buick,lacrosse,2010,lacrosse owner, 07/23/2010,Mixed bag but looks great,4,"Back to US cars after issue with Toyota.  Shopped around, this was a great value for features. Replaces Avalon.  Visibility  rear and side view is poor, which almost makes me wish I hadn't purchased car. It does have a little kick when it shifts automatic, but nothing horrible.  Beautiful finishes and details.  Middle Console not large and not user friendly. Too short, and if you extend, you can't use both cup holders. It's like no one at GM test drove for conveniences. Reliability to be determined. Only 2000 miles. Gas use (mostly city and heavy highway only 19.9 mpg). It's a very comfortable car, including large rear seat. You need rear park assist or camera for sure. GM almost has it right!"
buick,lacrosse,2010,DC3KEN, 07/29/2010,3 Month Owner,4,"In California and have had the CXL w/AWD for 3 months.  What a good looking, comfortable car.  Purchased with all the bells and whistles.  Bought this over the Lexus because it was $15,000 less, but just as stylish and luxurious.   Everyone who sees it thinks its hot and are impressed that GM is finally doing something right!  I really enjoy driving it.  It has enough muscle with the 3.0 (but not tons).  Trunk space isn't overly large and I can't get more than 2 suitcases in there.  The gas mileage is terrible, but friends with comparable Infinity and Lexus models say they get about the same.  The colors are also bad, boring and limited.  They need to get a better color palette!  "
buick,lacrosse,2010,Joe A, 08/19/2010,Overall great car,4,"I traded my Mercedes C240 4matic in for this car.  I have to admit I was reluctant to buy this car because Buick was always a car driven by older people (my father always owned a Buick). Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I love it.  It has a lot more interior space.  It also has a more plush feel but not too plush.  I have read in the reviews that people have been complaining about the limited arm rest and that it is too far back.  By accident, I found that the top of the armrest actually moves forward a few inches.  In order to do so you must push it forward and it snaps into place.  Overall, I am extremely happy with the purchase."
buick,lacrosse,2010,Pat, 08/22/2010,Lacrosse love,4,"My husband and I drove the 2010 Malibu and the Ford Taurus since these were the other two considerations for our purchase.  Neither one held a candle to the Lacrosse.  It didn't take long to decide after we took it for a ride.  This is a beautiful car with the handling of a sportier car, which I like.  Do yourself a favor and test drive one."
buick,lacrosse,2010,Larry, 08/31/2010,Good News for Buick,5,I picked this model to get the more powerful engine. It drives and handles like a sports car. The car is very comfortable and roomy. I traded in A Cadillac DTS and leased the Buick. The Buick is better equipped and handles better. It gets better gas milage and performs better than a number of competitive cars I tested.
buick,lacrosse,2010,Ding, 09/16/2010,2010 Buick LaCrosse CXS Review,4,"I love this car.  I have 1500 miles on it already.  I can't stop driving it.  I never thought I'd be back in a Buick, but I am.  Got an admiring look and a head nod yesterday while driving home.  Excluding lack of storage, the interior is excellent.  Guess I don't need all the stuff I've been carrying.  The exterior is very nice.  Very modern.  Car does have a loud ping when starting and even when sitting in the driveway now too.  Does anyone else have this issue?  Sound's under the car right behind the driver's seat.  Other than this, I love this car!!"
buick,lacrosse,2010,formertoyotaowern, 09/19/2010,lacrosse 2010,4,"This car is fun to drive.  Sit in bumper to bumper traffic an hour a day, and am comfortable in here. Bluetooth and sirius help a lot. Seats good for me (5'2"") and good back legroom for 3 adult.  A little stutter on shifting, but overall runs very well. (had a 2003 avalon, decided not to buy another) gas mileage ok, 21 mpg.  Middle console not well designed. you can't pull it out and have 2 cups in holders. No cup holders in back. the designers did not consider user's needs. storage limited inside and trunk just ok. lots of compliments to date.. you need rear park assist. wish i'd purchased the blind side too. but price became too steep. oversized sunroof kind of chintzy with the fabric"

"
buick,lacrosse,2011,longmiledriver, 04/10/2013,"300,000",5,"My 2011 model is not listed in Edmunds, an obvious oversite - Mine is a automatic FWD 3.6v engine/transmission - not the AWL.
 I drive about 43-50k per year - I have not had any issues at all.
 I purchased with 23.5 k Miles - had a weather strip replaced at purchase time.
At 65 mph, I get about 29mpg, at 72 mph, about 26mpg.
So far, I have not had to replace a thing.

I did have engine light turn on- I am in harsh weather, and the sensor for misfire of a cylinder is really sensitive - this happened only once - I reset it and havent seen it in 15k miles sense.
UPDATE

It's now 4 years later, and Edmunds still doesn't list the front wheel only 3.6L CXL version... I have the front wheel only version of the 3.6 CXL Lacrosse.  I have now 258,250 miles... The engine and transmission perform like it was when I purchased it with 23k miles.  I got 100k on the original Pilot, 72k on a pair of Cooper, and now my favorite is the Vogue signature gold, a great tire at a great price - now on 80k.  Still comfortable.  All 4 speed sensors on hub's went at different times, backup sensor went bad due to low voltage indicator - Lowell Buick told me to go to some hack to figure it out!   At 252k miles, my starter went bad.  All else works perfect!  Cooling and heated seats, mirrors, steering wheel, AC, electric windows locks, radio, etc... nothing is wrong. It drives true, the seats are still comfortable, all electric work. Body is still in great condition. Tiny rust on top of windshield starting. Couldn't be happier  I plan on another 100k.  MPG still is nearly 30 at 65mph - about 26'sh at 71mph. I use synthetic oil, do this myself, every 8-9 thousand miles or so.  It uses 1 quart since I've purchased it used.  Usually add a half quart around the 5-6 k mark.

This is an update, at 280,800 - all things still working - mpg still the same - slight tick, but doesn't seem serious.  Just the back up warning signal isn't working.  all good... hoping for another 70k - 350k the goal.  I'll let you know.  rust over windshield slightly worse.  I should take care of that....otherwise, added tires, I use Vogue Signature Gold - very reasonable, got 92k on last set.  About 10 k into these - they ride great - definitely best usa tire value performance tire.  I think I paid $492 for the set!  Discountdirecttire.com  try it - free shipping always. Wait for a holiday and get the deals!

New update - Just passed the 300,000 mark.  About 10k miles ago my transmission had a leak, turned out it was the front plastic housing - not a serious condition but glad I found the leak.  Fairly simple fix, then they replaced the transmission fluid.  The transmission has always been absolutely perfect!  Still no serious issues with engine.  My front seat is warn out - I suppose 300k will do that... but the air conditioned and heated seats still work great.   So very happy with this car.

buick,lacrosse,2011,lurker7, 09/21/2011,Shhhh! This is not Grandpa's Buick!,4,"14k miles....The ride, handling & acceleration are great!
I've previously owned German, Japanese, Ford & Chrysler...returning to try GM.
Cadillac, Lincoln and Lexus do not compare in ride, handling & price in this category. I test drove them.
Driver comfort is great! The AWD is sweet in Winter, but drops the MPG all year.

Large blind spots side & rear, so you need the rear camera.
Camera only comes with antiquated GM Navigation system with old maps. No DC plugs in dash for phones or GPS. Fuel filler is on passenger side. Fuel tank is too small."

buick,lacrosse,2011,ar15, 06/24/2011,Changed my opinion of American cars,4,"I am in love with my 2011 Buick LaCrosse CX.

The car exudes the kind of quality i have expected from more expensive cars and the models made in Japan."
buick,lacrosse,2011,normanrubin, 05/16/2011,Great car. Great value,5,"I just purchased the 2011 Buick Lacrosse.
The two other cars that I test drove were the Lexus ES 350 and the Lincoln MKS with ecoboast.
The Lacrosse was by far the best value.
The Lexus was bland and much more expensive than the Lacrosse.
Aside from
price and styling, I believe the cars were comparable.
The MKS was 10K more than the Lacrosse and in my opinion, was unattractive."
buick,lacrosse,2011,G Dirk, 01/29/2016,12 months with this car - a summary,5,"Thoroughly pleased with this car.  I have the CXS and all the features.  Here are the pro's / con's

1) this has a 12 volt plug - charge laptops other electronics which don't have USB support.  Has lighter plugs both in front and rear, and separate USB plug in front. Great to have all of these within arms reach
2) quiet ride - car cruises at 2000 rpm at 75mph.  Smooth ride.  Has a bit thicker glass in the side windows and you can tell
3) Ergonomics - great job thinking out things - gps, radio, switches, everything is within reach (also love heads up display)
4) other toys - rear window shade, heated steering wheel, car key sensor with remote start, rear view camera
5) size - this is a pretty big car with lots of room. You don't think about it until you park next to an E series or 5 series 

Cons 

1) a bit sluggish - not terrible (V6) but horsepower doesn't really kick in until after 4500 rmp - a turbo on this thing would be amazing
2) gas mileage - I do a mix of city and highway travel - averaging about 19.6 mpg.  Not terrible but would love it to be closer to low 20's ( this is a heavy car)

Overall - great car.  Really compares (outside of acceleration) with Euro counterparts.  Comfy, lots of toys, smooth ride.  Takes regular gas (this I found to be a great cost savings).  A good looking car. Has a nice shape and look to it.

However the trunk is puny, one set of clubs only. The interior ergonomics take a few weeks of ownership to pinpoint. The dash curves outward at the door just enough to bump your knee when exiting. The foot well is very tight for my size 11 feet. I'm 6'1"" and the center arm rest is too high and to far back making long trips uncomfortable. And there's no storage to speak of inside. Bought new 7/2010, my steering column was replace 11/2010. Last Monday the steeing gear was raplaced @ 17,500 miles!

buick,lacrosse,2011,zheigs, 05/21/2011,Cadillac What?,5,"I have been in the automotive business for 17 years and I have an overall love for the automobile. I've had many, from my 79 Ford Granada to my 2000 Chrysler 300 and Cadillac Deville to my 2008 Honda Accord. I have a special love for luxury cars. I fell in love with my Deville for its refinement, its quiet, smooth and comfortable cabin. Until my 2011 LaCrosse CXL-V6, I thought my Caddy was the gold standard. This car is everything Cadillacs are without the price tag and the interior actually looks so much better. It speaks high-tech luxury that is unmatched by Cadillac, Lexus or Infinity (for the price). If your're looking for a nice family car with plenty of options, look no further."
buick,lacrosse,2011,forsythe, 04/03/2011,Another quality GM product,5,"We leased a new lacrosse cxl last sat and ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! It rides great. As comfortable as a cadillac. Steering is good, features are awesome for the money. Quiet fantastic stereo.Love the fact I can control my car with my phone through onstar. Ive read the negative comments and funny thing. Most of them all end with the same sentence"" Should have gotten another toyota"". Someone is coming on here and lying. Mentions of hitting your head while getting in and out and not liking where buttons are placed and cup holders... You would have noticed these things on a test drive.Toyotas are boring death traps. ASk the families that died what they think. thank you GM for another great car:)"
buick,lacrosse,2011,vakmere, 08/23/2011,2011 LaCrosse CXL not bad - could be better,3," This is my 2nd Lacrosse. I had a 2007 prior to this one. Not a bad car to have as long as you dont try to go on long trips with lots of luggage. The incredibly small trunk is annoying. My golf clubs just about fit. What were they thinking? However this shortcoming is compensated buy the roomy interior and comfortable seating. Maybe I can put suitcases on the nice leather back seat? 
Steering wheel will turn when riding over bumps, hold on to it. 
Dash is laid out well and the accent lighting is very becoming. The sunroof slides back evenly with the roof unlike my 2007 which tilted up on an angle and was noisy. Gas mileage is average and the ride can be a little noisy depending on the surface you are driving on. The ride is no longer that cushy ride I had in my 2007 Lacrosse. Its a little stiffer and bouncier. Why did I buy it? Looks great, the price was right, holds is value longer, engine is better than the 2007 Lacrosse, and it just felt like a very solid well built car."

buick,lacrosse,2011,lacrosselemon, 06/06/2012,LaCrosse Lemon,1,"I purchased a new LaCrosse for $44,000 and are having major safety problems. The power steering has been worked on and replaced numerous times and is still making noises.
The exhaust system had to be replaced after numerous times at Crown Buick and finally was replaced at 3 months. The car will not start intermittently. This has happened on numerous occasions and the service department manager nor the mechanics can fix this. The trunk pops open while driving and the latch was replaced. Crown Buick and GM are aware of these ongoing problems. GM offered to replace the vehicle but has not done so to date.
The car has less than 5,000 miles.

Although beautiful, it has a constant vibration through the seats and causes the legs of my pants to visibly move. It has been back to the dealer twice. Once for a balancing which did nothing and once for a force balancing with one of the tires being replaced.The ride is worse than before. The vibration is so noticeable that I cannot enjoy anything about this care. I drive the same roads in a Toyota Solara and Hyundai Sonata which both have far superior rides. I have never been so disappointed with a car and will never return to GM. A huge mistake to leave Toyota. I wish I had paid the extra money to buy the Avalon."
buick,lacrosse,2011,iceman721, 02/18/2012,Attention to detail lacking....,3,"I had this car as a long term rental and put several thousand miles on it. I am a previous Lexus & Cadillac owner. This car drives as well as the car it copied (Lexus LS 350). It is surprisingly quiet for an American car (on par with Lexus). The ride is also quite good over smooth pavement and acceptable on the rough stuff. 

The little things get annoying very quickly (see improvements). I wouldn't buy one of these new but I would consider one with low miles and a great price on the used market. The reliability ratings for the Buick brand have been above average which may inspire confidence. Set the bar higher Buick pay attention to the details. "
buick,lacrosse,2011,vazoom, 07/28/2011,Lacrosse V6 is a Good Buy,5,"Now on my 1st month of ownership of the Lacrosse CX V-6.


Pros:
recently took a 1K mile trip to S. Virginia--mileage (22-23 mpg) as predicted on the open road with cruise control; very comfortable ride; great handling in country road turns along with unexpected braking for slow-moving traffic/animals crossing path.
Very responsive acceleration with the V-6.
Driving controls and info displays are very readable; ""blue"" lighting is a definite plus in
night driving.
Excellent craftmanship in interior construction.
Cons:
greatly reduced trunk space compared to older Buick Century; rear visibility (for parking) is just adequate even with beeping sensor. Overall: excellent buy vs Lexus"
buick,lacrosse,2011,Phieus, 07/27/2010,Unpretentious Luxury,4,"I wanted to buy another Avalon but not this time. So, I test drove the Lacrosse, fell in love and ordered one on the spot. I had to wait a while for it to be delivered but so far I am very happy with my CXS. Check that, I am in love with myn Lacrosse. The perforated leather is soft and supple, the seats are extremely comfortable, it handles well but the 19-inch tires are not as quiet as would I have liked. The fit and finish is excellent although not quite as refined as my Avalon. Overall, a great car and the only complaint I have so far is that I canot get the memory seat to work.  I read on Edmunds that this is a design flaw and GM has not found a fix for it. "

V-6 engine and steering wheel vibrate - dealer says that's normal as well as mileage.
Very difficult to get into car due to low roof line.
No storage, interior trunk release and interior gas cover release.
Cheap carpets and no glove box lock.
Has several fit and finish and mechanical defects - already been in for repairs several times.
There is much better out there and for far less money and aggravation."

Only 400 miles so far.  Brakes very responsive. Really like the LED taillights. Visibility is compromised by side pillars and rear view is small due to awkward angle of trunk. ""mood"" lighting is nice to have, but does reflect off windshield which can be safety hazard.  Leather is high quality.  Little to no storage in interior is a bummer.  Oversized sunroof is a nice feature, especially for the kids.  Bluetooth feature is great for handsfree phone calls (safety)! Stock stereo leaves something to be desired.  At $35K sticker should have quality stereo. Dual A/C is GREAT!"

After having it less then 2 years and multiple trips to the dealership for an engine compartment issue I was told nothing was wrong. That the engine was supposed to sound that way (even by the senior service manager at Rivard Buick) Over the next 3 years and trips to two other dealerships I am finally told that this noise is a serious issue with my engine and that there were 4 service bulletins for this issue dating back to 2013. No one at any of the dealerships told me about this until after the warranty was up. It was a competitor dealership that informed me and not Buick. Now I have been in contact with Buick customer service they tell me it’s not there responsibility to tell customers about the service bulletins even though there media campaign letters say they are supposed to. They say customer satisfaction is important to them. After contacting customer service for the final time time today I was lied to and told that I refused diagnostics on my vehicle amongst other untruths. Buick has lost my trust and my business.

This is my first and last American made car.The check engine light was on by the 1st oil change (Feb 2011). In May 2011, they had to replace the Catylic Converter.  In Sept 2011, they replaced the sunroof switch. In March 2012, I had to replace the cabin filter and they had to re-charge the battery.  In Aug 2012, they replaced a speed sensor.  In Sept 2012, they replaced the battery.  In November 2012, the check engine light was on again but they couldn't figure out why and cleared the code.  In August 2013, the battery was dead again.  Instead of them figuring out what the ""real"" problem is, they replaced the battery again.  Yesterday (11/11/15), the car stopped while I was on the highway. The transmission needs repairing.

Typical of Buick, a nice smooth ride and the turbo in the Regal was snappy and fun. However, getting in and out of the car is a job, and can even be painful! Out being harder than in. The WIDE plastic side of the seats containing the seat controls jabs one in the leg or buttock! There is no way to avoid it. There is no cushioning over the plastic, nor is it a thin piece of plastic. Very UNtypical of Buick's of the past. If your expecting that old comfortable feel we use to have in Buick seating, you won't find it getting in and out of these cars. "

She traded an '06 Caddy and thought the ride was every bit as good. around 35k what sounded like tire noise developed. turns out (after buying tires) the noise MAY be hub bearings.  About the same time the engine started stalling right off idle. thought it was the dreaded ""throttle plate coking up"" that seems engineered into every GM we've bought since 1996. Still not found that problem. I had tried to convince her to look at Nissans. She's finally listening.

Of course it's a GM product, but its also an amalgamation of engineering and design elements from Germany, Asia, as well as America. You would think that this would make for an odd combination, but all the elements really work well together. I bought the CX model with the V-6 and comfort convenience package for 26K which included a credit union discount and a loyalty discount - a great value for a refined, smooth riding, performance (280hp) car. The CX has cloth seats and I really recommend giving the cloth a look before springing for the leather on the CXL or CXS. The cloth is very comfortable and luxurious."

After 250 miles the check engine light went on and the car went in for servicing.  At 500 miles it is going back because the home link does not work.  We have noticed a significant blind spot where the bottom front roof pillar meets the top passenger mirror housing so it is impossible to see oncomming traffic from above the mirror. Views out the back window are also limited.  We have already had a near accident because of poor visibility.

Exterior design is great as well. Beautiful lines. The trunk line is a little high making visibility a minor issue but thanks to reverse sensing system I think its a wash.

Limo styling and subtle night-lighted dashboard design. Very quiet and the standard factory sound system is more than adequate to keep you smiling, and I'm pretty particular. If you expect a lot of highway driving this is the way to travel. Just invest in some wheel locks because the thieves will follow you hoping to remove those hot looking oversized wheels. Standard V6 engine is smooth and adequate power, a good trade off for the relatively high gas mileage compared to Mercedes or Cadillacs. The early depreciation hit meant that 2nd owners will get a tremendous bargain. This Buick provided a big step up in driving experience, when compared to the equally sized big Chevy sedan, and a far better value than the same sized Cadillac sedan. Intelligent car to buy instead of the foreign makes, especially comparing maintenance and ownership costs. I think of it as the car for MENSA members, and their spouses.

Before this car I had a Buick with the 3800 engine.  The 3800 was the best engine GM built, now all they have is junk.  GM must hire all the engineers who dropped out of college.  The milage sucked along with the poor power.  The 3.6 vvt is suppose to produce 301 horse, more like 30 horse.  Do yourself a favor and go buy a lexas, BMW, Honda or even a Ford, and I'm not a Ford man.  Hopefully the government doesnt bail out GM this time around.  GM what a joke!!

Most of the comments online here are spot on about the LaCrosse (especially the negative items). Gas mileage a lot less than Toyota, interior and trunk is more limited than the Avalon. Exterior visablity is on the poor side (lots of blind spots).   We target vehicles with a quite ride and this car provides it.  Dont know about liability, but it is like my suburban it should be ok. We are very happy with the vehicle and cant really complain about the negatives because we knew about them going buy the car. Thanks to Edmunds and those that posted reviews."

buick,lacrosse,2011,dave1140, 02/01/2011,My Best GM Product Yet,4,"I have owned GM products for over 60 years.
Our 2011 LaCrosse CXS is the best one yet.
I have read all of the negative comments and so be it.
The car has just over 600 miles and it just hums.
The acceleration is great from a standing start or pulling on to an Interstate.
The power is firm and reassuring.
I receive absolutely no lean or sway while going around clover leafs at 50+mph.
I do wish that there was an interior trunk release that leads me to a larger trunk.
Overall I love the car."
buick,lacrosse,2012,onedognight, 04/21/2012,Having Second Thoughts,3,"I purchased the 2012 LaCrosse four months ago.
The car is so low to the ground that I can't get in and out of my driveway without scraping the front end.
The front and side posts plus the high trunk make visability a real issue when driving in heavy traffic.
Other features that I don't like is the lock/unlock buttons being on the middle console instead of on the door and the only trunk unlock is on the key fob.
 The car performs well enough for a 4 cyl. but I wish I had known about the lack of visability and the drag issues before purchasing.
 Also, be aware that no spare tire comes with this car.
You get a can of Fix-A-Flat.
There is a space for it, but no tire."
buick,lacrosse,2012,Sam, 08/26/2015,2.0 Stars!,2,"So updating this after almost 15000 miles on the car.

Performance:  Acceleration in this is excellent, watch out for the torque steering in this.  If you hammer it while even turning slightly like to pass someone it will yank the steering wheel back straight.  Fastest stock V6 I have owned bar none.  There are a lot of reports on transmission issues with the 2012 and surrounding years.  The way this is geared it's going to shift high especially that 2nd to 3rd shift.  When you go from 2nd to 3rd it will literally drop only about 500 rpm.  When I bought this it was shifting 4000-5000 RPM on that shift. 3rd to 4th was only slightly lower.  This was unacceptable to me.  So after fighting with Buick for months (While under factory warranty.) I finally got a significant answer as to how to fix this.  These are adaptive transmissions.  They learn how you drive.  If you take off fast it's going to learn to shift at a higher RPM, which over the long term is not healthy for the engine or the transmission.  Eventually I got them to flash the Transmission Control and wipe the memory clean.  It took about 2 months for the car to 'learn' my driving style but now it rarely shifts over 3000 rpm.  If it does it is because I have it in Manual mode or I've got it floored.  Anyone out there having ""Transmission problems with their Buick Lacrosse"" don't let the dealer tell you this is normal.  It takes them about an hour to fix it...

In regard to comfort... If you are tall or a big guy/woman getting in and out will be uncomfortable.  The way the seat sits even back as far as it goes still puts a significant amount of your legs beyond the front of the door, thus making you pull your legs back and spin in the seat before being able to put your legs on the ground.  I cannot count how many times I have smacked my knees on the steering wheel ""even with it adjusted as high and far into the dash as possible.""  The advertisement they do of Shaquille O'Neal sitting comfortably in one of these is so much BS.  That said, it has a comfortable sporty ride once you are actually ""IN"" the car.

The interior is decent.  I have noticed that some of the chrome 'coating' on some of the accents starts peeling off.  I did like the LED highlights in the car, and the leather is supple, soft, and comfortable.

As others have posted, the car has some visibility safety issues.  Blind spots are a HUGE issue.  If you are backing out of a angled parking space, best of luck you're not going to be able to see a vehicle or person approaching.  Backing up is difficult in the car period, lane changing requires a full head/body turn to see if someone is near the normal blind spot.  A simple though not a thorough fix is to buy 2 stick on blind spot mirrors, and put them up in the top outside corner of your normal mirrors.  This helps tremendously in traffic.  If you live in the North.  THIS IS NOT THE CAR FOR YOU!  The traction control on this has to be the worst traction control on any vehicle I have EVER driven.  Works wonders on dry pavement.  Get in an inch of snow you're not moving.  The traction control has a rev-limiter on it.  If you can't get traction you are literally dead in the water!

Reliability is good overall.  I've only had one other significant issue that so far is unresolved in this vehicle.  If you read Buick forums they are famous especially during the winter for having the evaporator drain get plugged up.  If it's not dealt with immediately it has the potential to get moldy.  Evidently mine wasn't dealt with immediately.  I've had more problems with a moldy acrid scent when running the heat, it is especially bad when run on recirculate.  Once this happens there really is very little you can do.  My next step will be replacing the pan itself to see if that will help.

Value is about par for the course for a mid sized sedan.  The cost is a little above what I
 think it should have been just based on safety alone.  But overall it is pretty economical.

The car is E85 capable.  Running E85 I average about 22mpg on a 70 mile round trip mixed city/highway driving.  On Unleaded with 10% Ethanol I average betwen 24.5 and 25 on the same trip.  If you keep this car at 65mph with relatively few stops over long distance it will push out high 20's low 30's mpg.

buick,lacrosse,2012,Peter Mowatt, 04/06/2016,Best vehicle I have had life to date,5,"I wanted a living room on wheels and I got it! I have put 85000 miles on it due to family proximity and those spontaneous road trips. My baby has been excellent!
I love driving her. Great weight. Solid doors!! Super quiet! Excellent handling and when you have to tromp on it, it comes alive! 
In all of this time, I only had one problem.  It was weird. Wouldn't turn over. Tried using the big battery for the jump start and it wouldn't allow it.
 A new battery at my most excellent dealer resolved it. 
NOTE: When I tried to start it after charging and if failed, it would not let me remove the key! Yikes!
This is still the best car I have had for full time driving. Knock on wood and happy to report zero rattles. 
One note, it eats oil. Has since the beginning.  I am surprised that the oil warning doesn't go on when low on oil. Must be pressure guided. Easy to tell. It gets sluggish. You can feel it.  Check it monthly. Nothing is wearing out in the interior.  A new set of car mats at 90k was a great investment both in appearance and enjoyment. After all, it is the first thing you see when you are getting in. Taking this sweet ride for the long haul. See you at 130k!
Are 131000, lights started coming in. The catalytic converter was failing and the ABS light came on too. It would have been about 1500.00 to resolve followed by tires.  I needed more long term reliability.   I traded it in and got a 2017 LaCrosse with 1800 miles on it this past January.  My 2012 was the best fir my needs for almost 7 years.

buick,lacrosse,2012,Hector Lahera, 04/02/2016,"Love at first sight, and so far it's been all joy.",5,"I bought the car used with 24400 miles.  It rides comfortably and drives as if it were on tracks.  The 6 cyl 
engine delivers power on demand; and it is easy to find oneself speeding without meaning to do so.  If you buy the car used, and don't like the shift points, and I didn't, reset the transmission to the factory settings.  The cargo space is only adequate.  Rear vision would be next to zero without the rear view camera.

Another year on, no problems of any kind.  It is a fine, well made car.  The reason for the four stars on Safety, is that the roof posts, plus the headrest on the right, create large and dangerous blind spots to the rear of the driver.

buick,lacrosse,2012,RF, 09/02/2015,Great Value Compared to Mercedes Anything,5,"It is really is ""sleeper"" surprised quite a few other cars and trucks that thought it was just another Granddad's Buick. It has the touring suspension and handles comparable to my Merc CLK - once you get used to a bigger car.  I have owned this car for over a year- added over 17000 miles Mix between Highway (i95 to Fla) and city. Averages 23 MPG overall. NO problems or complains - I have learned to use the features which is still more than I need, the AC/heated seats are really nice especially in South Carolina Summer. AC cools the car quickly, Bluetooth very easy to set up and use.  Plenty of power not a race car but it was not designed as such either. Very quiet on the road, people complain about the engine noise - drive a Honda or Toyota and compare for yourself. Brakes are great - emergency stop in traffic when a car pulled out in front of us and stopped.  Wing mirrors are the only down fall on this car huge blind spots difficult to get adjusted to avoid the blind spots

buick,lacrosse,2012,thadp, 01/14/2012,A better value,4,"Buick has a winner with the 2012 Lacrosse.
BMW, Audi watch out.
The Lacrosse with GM incentives is a much better value than most other comparable sedans. The 303 HP V-6 can compete well with other comparable sedans.
Responsive, smooth and quiet engine with reasonable fuel economy.
Ride is comfortable, quite and smooth. Cornering is flat at high speeds and vehicle tracking is excellent with good steering response. A fun car to drive. On the negative side, first gear is much too low, a ratio, better suited for a four cylinder.
Side visibility hindered by door post.
High head rests hinders backing visibility.
The front bucket seats are too narrow except for a small butt person.

buick,lacrosse,2012,mike652, 02/15/2012,Not Your Father's Buick,4,Having been longtime Pontiac owners we always thought Buick's styling and road manners skewed old. This is not the case with the LaCrosse. The looks are outstanding but it comes at a price. It is hard to judge the front and rear of the car and the blind spots when changing lanes are hard to see. It takes some getting used to but consider getting back up assist and blind spot alert. It has a sporty road feel without a punishing ride. The seats are very comfortable. The layout of the instrument panel is such that the tilt wheel is always obstructing something. The digital speedometer is a big help. The trunk is only adequate for luggage for two. That's the price you pay for the large back seat

My parents have a new Buick Lacrosse and the visibility is nothing short of awful.  I absolutely do not like driving it.  There are blind spots everywhere.  I cannot believe that a car company would design a car that is unsafe to drive.  If I am at a stop sign several seconds pass before I have visibility of a full sized car or truck coming from my right.  I have to lean forward and backward to avoid that blind spot.  There is no way of viewing a car when merging or changing lanes except with the side mirror.   If I look over my left should all I see is the b pillar and the c pillar and a tiny slit."

My kids love it too because it is sporty and fun. The control panel is easy to access and the options are such a luxury.

Not to mention creating quite a blind spot when looking over the shoulder for traffic. The lumbar support in the drivers seat is too large even when reset to zero, thus making my back hurt even after a short drive.
This car is so low to the ground that even curbs become a hazard! Dealership's driver ran into a curb and caused extensive damage. Between seat console is awkward, pinches fingers when extending the arm-rest and storage is limited.
The steering column is clumsy to adjust, why isn't it electric? Can't open trunk from inside???? "

buick,lacrosse,2012,vakmere, 12/23/2011,All show no go,3,"Had this Lacrosse for 4 months and I'm not impressed any more. Clumsy and noisy is how I would describe it. Here's the list,

1. Car rides fine until you go over a series of bumps. Hold on to your coffee if its open.

2. Knee and head protection may be needed if you want to enter or exit this car quickly. Very cumbersome. Turning in or out of your driveway may cause wiplash due to the stiff suspension.

3. A distinct and fairly audible metalic ticking noise from the engine. Dealership says it's normal, I say there's a problem. Engine shakes noticeably at idle (in drive). Accelleration and crusing is no problem. 

4. Trunk space is way too small, tight fit for 2 sets of golf clubs."

From the start there was rust on the bumper and trunk of the car, they ""fixed"" it at time of sale, day after sale and day after after sale, the rust keeps coming back and this makes 5 times the dealer ""fixes"" the rust issue, a new car as expensive as this should not have rust."

The dash options have separate controls for almost everything. I have to search and test every change which is unfriendly while driving. The On Star is no substitute for a built-in GPS system.

Remarkable 34 mpg on the highway.That's at 70 mph.  47,000 miles and the only problem, which is almost a maintenance item, was battery replacement at the 5 year mark. Incidentally the car can start utilizing the eco-system battery! My best friend bought a 2013 on my recommendation and has 87,000 miles with no problem.

Three negatives-backing up visibility is horrible, getting in and out of drivers seat is tight(I'm 5'11"" & weigh 185 pounds), and the trunk is small because of the eco battery.

Ours is the touring model and very fun to drive.  I'm 215 lbs and 6'3"" and I fit fine in the driver's seat which is very comfortable.  I thought I loved the dash with all the buttons but I still have trouble fining the right button when needed.  It's my wife's car so she doesn't have this problem.  The car feels nimble and responsive and is very powerful with just over 300hp and really is fun to drive.  Visibility is good except for the large A pillars which will sometimes hide traffic.  Love the turn sensitive headlights.  We now have around 115k miles on the car and we've had the transmission replaced under the extended warranty.  Also, a few oil leaks and we needed the power steering hoses replaced.  I do not like the tranny on this car... .or at least the mapping.  Even under normal or slight acceleration, the RPM's go into the 5k range when shifting from 1st thru 3rd.  Other than those few things, we love the car.  We have our fingers crosses that something else expensive doesn't break."

buick,lacrosse,2012,CF Bona, 09/05/2020,Good and Bad,3,"The Good:  Excellent smooth, quiet ride.  Nice handling.  Very responsive. Very attractive design.  Love the look of the car.  Good acceleration when needed. More than acceptable gas mileage.  Up to 38 mpg without AC and 32 mpg with AC on highway.  Around 27-28 mpg in city.  The AC compressor went at about 35,000 miles, 3 years ago -- but that has been all! 
Very dependable and durable vehicle.  Low maintenance.  The Bad -- very poor sight lines when driving and backing up.  Lots of blind spots.  Have to have your head on a swivel when backing out of a parking space since you can't see people or other vehicles well at all.  Tough to get in and out of without hitting your head on the top of the door frame!  I'm only 5ft 7 inches, so its not my height!  Car is so low to the ground that you are constantly scrapping the front of the car on the pavement especially when entering or exiting a parking lot.  No way to avoid it.  Lastly, because of the battery located in the trunk, space there is very limited.  I can't even fit a set of golf clubs in the trunk.  I have to put them in the backseat.  Overall, as a comfortable ride and pleasure to drive and look at, this is a great car.  But the problems mentioned are not minor.  "

and have plenty of room in the front and also as a passenger in the back seat.
The automobile is very quite and solidly built.
I bought the model with leather interior, heads up display, heated seats, and the warning system on the mirrors that let you know if a car is in your ""blind spot"".
This is a quality automobile and Buick has done an excellent job.
Would definitely buy this automobile again.

Engine is crazy smooth.
Transmission is slick.
Interior is just perfect.
The car is super quiet.
The ride is supple, although I'm really enjoying sport mode, which instantly stiffens the ride.
Electronics are going to take a while to master, for sure, but the Harmon Kardon sound system is incredible.
Don't forget to set Surround Sound.
Back seat is second to none.
Trunk space is decent and the fold down seats have already come in handy.

So far I have no regrets.
Living around Chicago, gas prices are hovering around $4.50/gal for reg grade.
I needed to trade the V8 gas guzzler for something more reasonable and this was my choice.


I've considered the 300, but went with Buick due to Chrysler's past power train issues and overall value with Buick.

The car handles well, ride quality is okay and acceleration is acceptable.
That's saying a lot
considering I've only owned V8's leading up to this.
I drive with confidence on the highway and can easily accelerate to pass slower vehicles. "
buick,lacrosse,2013,Robert, 09/24/2016,Excellent Domestic Sedan,5,"I purchased vehicle used (14K) and have driven it 28K during the past three years.   At 40K, there have been no maintenance issues whatsoever, and the vehicle drives as smooth as silk, with excellent acceleration, handling, and a very comfortable and quiet ride.  Materials are top notch, and many of my neighbors who drive foreign cars have expressed their admiration for the interior and exterior design of my LaCrosse.    Safety ratings are in the top 2% of vehicles, which is a primary reason for my purchase.  The HUD (Heads Up Display) is exceptionally well designed and keeps my eyes focused on the road and not in the cockpit.  Active articulated headlights provide superior visibility along the visual line of site, and the radar for parking and lane change is great for enhancing safety.  Cabin is spacious, especially with legroom.  Open-through from trunk and fold down rear seats provides great cargo space. Highly recommend the LaCrosse, although the price point of newer models is out of my price range.  As a 1-year old used vehicle with low mileage, I walked away with an extraordinary value.

buick,lacrosse,2013,Sesa, 07/04/2018,Had my car 5 years....love it still!,5,"I bought my 2013 Buick Lacrosse new. It is large, comfortable and quiet inside. We easily fit what are now 3 teenaged girls in the back seat, and my very large husband has no problem getting comfortable behind the wheel for long drives. We have taken the Lacrosse on several 1200-1400 mile trips, and have put about 57,000 miles on it. It accelerates smoothly and is responsive to my admittedly ""lead foot"". In the back, the fold down seats have proven to be handy when bringing home items from the home improvement store, and there is plenty of room for groceries in the trunk. LOVE the Bluetooth for the cell phone! The ambient lighting along the dash at night is a great touch. The interior finishes are great, and are well maintained 5 years later. Gas mileage is ok with the V6 engine, but I do a lot of city driving, as well. I didn't get the backup camera, but wish that I had. A couple of Cons: the Lacrosse has a major blind spot so you do have to be extra careful if you want to change lanes or back out of a parking spot in a crowded lot. The one USB port is inconveniently located. The only problem I have had is with the electronics for the entertainment system, and it didn't happen until the 3 year warranty was up. The stereo/phone system in the car has randomly shut off and on a few times while in use, but for less than a second. Due to it's low profile, if you are very large like my husband, getting in and out of the passenger seat may prove to be annoying. I do still get compliments on it's appearance, interior, and smooth ride. Overall it is a great car and I do not regret purchasing it at all.

buick,lacrosse,2013,not bad, 08/25/2016,Wear sunglasses,4,"My son bought this car for my wife as a gift. Car looks great from outside and interior styling is beautiful BUT  Front view, the two forward posts create a very bad blind spot that makes it difficult to see sides in front of you while turning. While Edmunds complains about the rear visibility, how can they not touch on the forward turning visibility. Next, I'm small stature 5'5 with all the seat adjustments I still cant get a comfortable seat position, as my knees are always too high. If this seat pivoted forward by a couple of degrees then perhaps it would help. No such problem ever on my Jap cars.          Next. The audio and temp controls. These buttons are small , so fat finger  OH OH is common and getting used to them will take a long while. Also the chrome bezel around the unit glares into your eyes and need to wear sunglasses especially when the sun is in the ten o'clock position. Finally put black electrical tape over it. Lastly.  muffler exhausts under bumper not through it. This creates brown discolorations that needs to be cleaned weekly. It would behoove Buick to make their engineers drive Japanese cars for a while since their human factor knowledge seems to be lacking.

buick,lacrosse,2013,mel, 11/26/2015,rear brake seizure!,3,"I bought this car in Jan this year.  Pros include handling, the 3.6 performs very well, awd seems to work as it should, I average about 22 mpg with a best of 27mpg on a trip.  Cons,  trunk is tiny, brakes do not like weather,  I had to accelerate hard in reverse to get brakes to release, since then the Buick dealer did perform a brake service that they are supposed to charge the customer $120.00 for free.  However, this did not help.  This car is embarrassing to drive with the brakes squealing almost continually.  I did contact Buick and they pushed it back on the dealer, they obviously feel that safety is something that the owner should pay for!  The dealer told me that they have had other Lacrosse's towed because of this issue.   This will be the last GM vehicle I buy because of the lack of response to this serious issue.   My kid is learning to drive and is scared of this car.  Fortunately for her I also bought an Accord that she loves to drive!

Agree with the Edmunds review about the relatively small truck space and limited rear visibility, but the latter arises from having to fit the rear-view camera into the design. And speaking of design, be advised that there is virtually no place to store anything, and the storage spaces that do exist are undersized. Just a poor piece of human engineering. I've actually had to buy a Rubbermaid front seat organizer, which is absurd. Also absurd is the hump in the middle of the back-seat floor, which serves no useful mechanical purpose; why is it there?"

My mechanic cannot do airbag work so it went to the Chevy dealer, ugh !

buick,lacrosse,2013,Taller Than U, 10/08/2019,Lyft Rides Drive Home American Value,5,"I bought this Hybrid used for a comfortable ride for 4 to 5 people, outstanding rear seat legroom, quiet ride, luxury finishes and great mileage. Now 70,000 miles later it still excels in all those categories. I have been riding Lift recently. Much newer cars like the Hyundai Sonata have back seats that feel like I am sitting on lumpy potatoes. The back seat of the LaCrosse wraps the passenger in comfort, just like the front. Reliability and repair costs have been excellent. I think it’s perfect for driving in crowded California with a lot of time spent on the freeway. It also handles very well on scenic mountain roads as a luxury touring car. Buick made a great car in this hybrid. Product Labeling is bad for the LaCrosse Hybrid. You will probably have to check each LaCrosse shown for the 30+ mpg. Unfortunately Buick discontinued the hybrid in 2016 before it could establish the great reputation it deserves.

The LaCrosse Hybrid definitely breaks the stereotype of the stodgy sedan driven by little old ladies. It is quite roomy and offers a nice combination of luxury and economy. The car is very comfortable, handles well, and gets the fuel economy of a much smaller car. It's not exactly a screaming performer but for city fuel economy in the mid- to upper 20s and highway mileage in the upper 30s, that can be excused. One odd feature is the car does not come with a spare tire! Instead, it ships with a 12-volt air compressor that also has a built-in bottle of sealant. Unfortunately, the sealant on mine has an expiration date of 2018, so it was already no good. I went ahead and invested in a spare tire and a jack to feel safer going down the road. I've had the car for six months and have put a bit over 5,000 miles on it with no trouble at all. It really is a shame GM quit producing this car for the U.S. market.

The only option mine lacks is back seat dvd , single, didn't need it. But enjoy the car immensely! Happy hunting..

buick,lacrosse,2014,lionnation, 10/31/2014,"Great Value, Best in category for the price",4,"I cross-shopped this 2014 LaCrosse w/the Avalon hybrid, ES300 hybrid, MKZ hybrid, Fusion hybrid, and some 1 year used Audi A4's and BMW 3-series; this care definitely had a superior suspension and quieter cabin that all of the above. My car is my automotive office; I need to have reliable, quiet tele-conferences while driving, but also want to be able to crank some tunes in between w/a high quality audio system. It does both of these very well. The infotainment system works fine, but is a bit slow, but as I cross-shopped, I find that it is true for most brands. I was biased in trying to get a domestic car if the quality and value were there; I believe I got it! Mixed MPG = 32 after 1K miles!"
buick,lacrosse,2014,Tomkat, 12/29/2016,Buick is a touch of class,5,"Needed a car more comfortable for my back. I traded my 2015 Focus Titanium for a 2014 Buick Lacrosse and the difference is very noticeable. With the comfort of the front seats and the quiet ride, the 2014 Buick Lacrosse doesn't  disappoint. I wanted the hiper strut front suspension and adaptable ride so I looked for a FWD with 19 inch wheels. Everything about the car feel high quality. No rattles and a very solid feel.  Love the looks ride of this car.  Test drive one.  I am impressed.

Not a screeching wheel smoking start since I have AWD, but fast enough to merge safely on the interstate. AWD is great in the North East where I live and get much snow and ice.

buick,lacrosse,2014,zorrolives, 12/24/2013,Premium 1 3.6,4,"Just leased a Carbon Black on Black, turned in my 2011 Regal Turbo, going from sporty to land cruiser and more comfort, which is what I wanted. So far I love the newly designed interior and the simplified layout. Intellilink is nice and easy to use and the voice command is much improved folks. Side Blind Zone Alert is truly wonderful, still make my headcheck though.

Update: Three years later, still love this vehicle, never any problems other than the dealer had to replace my battery a few months ago. Have decided to keep this
vehicle(buy it). Still looks new, and drives great. The new Lacrosse (2017), sits too low for me and the looks are just ok, resembles the Impala too much in my
opinion.

buick,lacrosse,2014,glbustin, 07/14/2019,"Well designed, comfortable, surprisingly spirited",5,"This is a very good quasi-luxury sedan, handsome in its design, with a well-appointed interior and comfortable seats.   The 3.6L engine is surprisingly spirited, a refinement on a basic engine GM has had for years, a workhorse with power to spare, even for this large sedan.  Cargo space is excellent.  Handling is easy and most controls are intuitive.  My wife is the primary driver, and this is the largest car she has ever handled.  She is perfectly at ease with it, after some years of driving mid-sized cars.  Gas consumption is on the high side, about 22 mpg average, but this car is driven a lot on suburban roads.   Highway driving mpg is closer to 28. I would definitely buy another LaCrosse.  Pity they intend to discontinue the model.

buick,lacrosse,2014,Larwin Rowe, 03/01/2018,Lacrosse is BOSS!!!,5,"I've liked the Buick Lacrosse for years. Actually, I've loved BUICKS for years, as this is my 3rd Buick (I just bought a 2015 *my 4th* a few weeks ago and traded this one in). I bought a Base model with 48 k miles on it. It's a SMOOTH OPERATOR! Very nice interior. Smooth ride. Great looks. I regularly received compliments on my car. My only regret was that I didn't get a higher trim, as the Base model that I got did not come with heated or memory seats, navigation, nor a sunroof. The latter 2 I could deal with, but the memory seats were an issue for me, as my 2 former Buicks had memory seats, and it was a nuisance resetting my seats after others would drive it! So glad I upgraded to a higher trim with memory seats. Other than that, I have no complaints at all about the car. Best car I ever had (outside of the 2015 that I own).

*update*

As I mentioned earlier, I no longer have this model. I have a 2015 model that I bought with 33k miles on it. But I hope whoever has my 2014 is thoroughly enjoying it!

**Update Mar 4, 2020**

Still a smooth operator. I now have 80k miles on it. I've taken it to NC atleast twice and NJ. Great road car. Eats up the miles. I do wish that it had better gas mileage in the city, however. That aside, great car.

*update 9/4/2020*

Again, I have a 2015 Lacrosse with 88k miles on it. I traded the 2014 in for a higher trim Lacrosse. And, so far, so good. It still drives nicely. Again, I bought it with 33k miles on it, so in the two years I've had it, I put 55k miles on it. In that time, I've only had one mechanical issue. The ""Vapor Canister Purge Valve Solenoid"" went bad and triggered the check engine light. It's very inexpensive: around $20 online. I bought the part, had it replaced, and the light went off. It's been trouble free ever since. 
I love my car, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a large, luxurious, comfortable sedan.

buick,lacrosse,2014,Lacrosseowner, 02/13/2017,Constantly something wrong with it,1,"Bought a  CPO 2014 AWD Leather.  I bought it with just over 20 miles.  It now has 35k miles. In one year, it has been in the shop (in addition to annual inspection / oil changes) for (1) rotor resurfacing, (2) front car seat tracks (x2 separate trips, resulting in now inverse controlling of the seat), (3) recall for airbag issue (4) The radio/nav screen just stopped turning on (still being addressed)  (4) resealing of tires at 6/32 tread because TPMS was constantly on (5) check engine light came on for a few days after high speeed acceleration on the highway (that went away a few days later).  Also, I just got a new notice from buick that something could go wrong in the future, so warranty on that item is extended (I forget what it was about, don't anticipate owning it much longer to find out).  Gas mileage is poor. Comfort is poor for me  - seat to steering wheel to dash controls are awkward.  It is loud inside.  I loved how this car looked and still do, but that's about it for now.

LIKES: This is without a doubt a sexy car. The leather interior and seats are beyond Buick good. The ride is very smooth. 

I really love my car it is just a gutless wonder. I didn't know Buick made a toy engine. The stereo and info system is known to be bad. It is most definitely not a cheap fix. Actually none of the maintenance on this car is cheap. 

FUN FACT: this Lacrosse was meant to be Buicks first drive alone car. But all the safety features that was added to the car made it keep stalling out. So it is beyond safe. Just doesn't drive itself.

On the down side, poor job on the steering wheel adjustment, needs more telescopic ability, speedometer is hard to read if wheel is adjusted to my liking.
Cannot see the hood,  makes it hard to judge distance when parking, front of car will not clear all curbs, easy to damage front of car on these tall curbs and parking blocks.
I have owned a 95 Buick Road master and a 2007 LaCernne in recent years and I believe this LaCrosse is going to beat the quality, fuel mileage and performance of both the other Buick's.

buick,lacrosse,2015,Art Furcar, 11/26/2016,Nice ride to be inside,3,"PROS:  This thing is great to sit in.  While not a great driver's car: no steering feedback, heavy feel, slightly mush brakes- it handles very well.  My CPO car came with 18-inch Firestone Firehawk sneakers, not a great rain tire, but we live in the AZ desert, so great for driving here.  The car feels VERY surefooted, and goes right where you point it.  The suspension feels solid, and inspires confidence.  It accelerates quickly, but isn't a barn burner.  CONS: There is no GPS navigation (not requiring OnStar) in these, unless you pay at least $1,500 more.  You have to have an OnStar subscription to get the nav, and it doesn't come with the lower-level (cheaper) subscriptions).  Our car ""chugs"" at about 23 MPH, probably due to the transmission trying to choose the right gear (""hunting"").  Not sure if that's a transmission problem or whether it's a design problem that affects all of these cars.  The USB port is in the center compartment.  There's only one port.  There's a slot in the front of the compartment so you can run cables out without leaving the lid open.  But there's no good place to put a smartphone or other device, except by using both cupholders that are immediately in front of that compartment.

CONS:  Seems like it's too complicated for the techs to fix.  We have had our AC compressor replaced (and that still works).  We also had the outside temp reading repaired, and it worked for about 5 months.  Now it's usually off by at least 10 degrees.  It seems to get stuck on a reading that's too low, never too high- just as it was before they fixed it.  They also replaced our battery, because the voltmeter readings jumped around between 11 and 15 volts.  That still happens.  Going back to Hyundai in all probability.  Our car now has about 49K miles.  It's still really comfortable, and drives great.

buick,lacrosse,2015,Patti Y, 07/29/2016,"Comfortable, Beautiful and Economical Too.",4,"Been looking for a mid-size luxury vehicle for a while and could not find one that I could afford; that is until, I found my CPO 2015 Buick LaCrosse.  Sitting inside makes you feel special, its sleek, well appointed, and so very quiet.  Bluetooth and OnStar work flawlessly.  Even though the trunk is small, the pass through seats really help and the front seats are so comfortable with plenty of leg room and comfortable seating for back passengers.   The 2.4L eassist combination has remarkably good pickup for pulling onto the interstate or passing, however the stop/start technology makes it sluggish from a dead-start.  I wouldn't really put the LaCrosse in the same class as a typical hybrid, I would consider it a semi-hybrid, but the regenerative technology is cool.  I am ok with the mileage, I think I will get a little better when I figure out the best driving strategies.  Things I don't like; I found the only usb and the mp3 plug in hidden under the center armrest  which is inconvenient; and the arm rest sets too far back and is very small.  The tilt / telescoping steering column could have been better engineered, as it blocks the speedometer when adjusted to the point I like and it does not adjust nearly enough.  The side pillars are large and blocks driver view somewhat and you can't see the front of the car no matter how high you adjust the seat, which makes it difficult to know how far you are from the curb, just need to be careful when parking or getting near another vehicle.

The panoramic power moon roof,  rear camera, rear parking assist, blind side and lane change alerts and 18"" chrome clad wheels all make driving much more fun and safe.

I have the cheapest version car is incredible in smooth ride. Being it's the luxurious version of Buick this vehicle powered with four cylinder other cars as new Maxima and Chrysler 300 don't have 'em. It does get good fuel economy for a large car as Lacrosse so stylish at best. I love the logic quality materials but one thing as said about two occasions the rear headroom and visibility is horrible other than a cheap car purchased. The car is nice but seems the controls are bit difficult at times other than that like this car it's affordable getting this vehicle might keep for couple months after my leased be up on something else.

I don't know how General Motors gets away with advertising this car as being quiet ride for this car. Road noise is very noisy. The seats are like sitting on a wood board, not comfortable at all. Overall quality as I have owned other Buick's this one really sucks as far riding quality, noise limits within the interior, I really wouldn't buy another one. I am glad that GM is eliminating the Buick lacrosse in 2020, the vehicle is severely overrated any ways.

buick,lacrosse,2015,Larry, 06/25/2017,Do not buy a Buick without...,1,"When you test drive this car pay special attention to the front head rest. I don't think this is limited to the Lacrosse.  We didn't notice it on test drive, and I bought the car for my wife because we wanted the Delphi safety features on the high end trim package.  The headrest is too far forward a problem that owners have complained about for years on forums.  Dealers will do nothing to help.  Buick doesn't care.  This is one of the cars traded in most within one year, and I don't this is the reason.   My wife, who is short, refuses to drive it.  Other than this and the fact that the side windows are too small, I like the car very much.   Without Buick's help, I removed the headrest , put it in a vice and bent it to a better fit.  The technology is too complicated, especially when I had to show the dealer how to reset the oil change counter.  The touch screen displays can be a distraction while driving. It's a very comfortable and quiet ride. Thge back up camera display is at an angle so the sun blocks it out at times. I like the car.

buick,lacrosse,2015,Bill Keeler, 08/29/2018,"Surpisingly fun to drive, but crummy quality",2,"Our LaCrosse is very comfortable, and passengers often comment on how nice it is inside.  But the crummy electronics drive me crazy.  It's fun to drive, and surprisingly peppy given the size of the vehicle.  It corners very well indeed, and is extremely sure-footed.  The mechanical engineering is sound.  The electronics are kludgy.  We just replaced the battery again, having had the GM battery replaced just 18 months ago with an identical one under warranty.  We bought one from AutoZone to replace it.  Never have we owned a car that had such frequent battery problems (this is the third one in less than two years of ownership).  The voltage gauge bounces around as though there's a problem with the charging system.  The dealer swears there isn't.  It spends most of its time well below 14V.  Sometimes it's at about 11.5V.  Predictably when I stop the car and leave it idling (especially at night), the gauge will sink gradually to an indicated voltage of about 12V.  The bluetooth is poorly implemented.  We use the main display for a digital speed readout in the center of the analog dial.  Sometimes, it displays information about the bluetooth device that is currently paired, or information about the car that is utterly frivolous.  So we have to navigate back to the speed display for no discernible reason.  Likewise, the main LCD panel (which is a resistive touchscreen that is somewhere between decent and insensitive to touch) sometimes displays a warning about distracted driving that has to be manually cleared by touching the OK button on the screen.  That's dangerously distracting!  The chrome on the driver and front passenger door handles is flaking off, leaving sharp edges that we need to mind.  Never had that happen in any previous car.  I won't ever buy another Buick.  We're spoiled by Hyundai.  While the LaCrosse is very comfortable and drives great, there's an obvious reason that it has about half the warranty of a Hyundai.

buick,lacrosse,2016,Guy Yocom, 11/22/2016,Stylish and functional from horn to hoof!,4,"This off-the-lot model did not come with the confidence package, which really should be standard due to visibility issues. My fault and I regret not ordering and waiting patiently. But the vehicle beckoned to me, and the killer price (Buick promotion 15% off, plus a bit more on this particular model as 2017s were rolling in) made me an easy mark. Very happy from the get-go with this car. Astonished by the value, and I love it more each day. I rent a great many cars on business and this one is more luxurious than any of them. The quiet Is a plus. Near silence even at 50 mph, and then only the pleasant hum of the tires. Handles beautifully. There is but one drawback: The poor visibility resulting from thick pillars at 10 am and 2 pm, rear view no treat either, and blind-spot is wretched. That's why I miss the driver confidence package, which dealer says cannot be retrofitted. Sure wish I had the head-up display, too (!) But adding up the other pluses: Heated seats rock, interior lighting is legant, the surfeit of USB ports wonderful. Love the remote car starting, memory seats and even trunk storage, which though somewhat cramped, turns into bat cave by lowering of back seats. Love the push-button parking break. The V-6 engine is plenty beefy for any circumstance, When I need to pass I tickle the gas pedal and--whom!--I'm gone. Buick nailed so many details with this model. Headrests are perfect...seats hug you like firm glove; nice balance between cushiness and support...unlocking of door with push of a button is a minor miracle, and entire layout of controls is very sensible. I'm a fan, and wish there were a way to add that pesky driver confidence package.

buick,lacrosse,2016,Al Brunsting, 12/24/2018,Pros & cons,2,"Pros: Overall good looks. Comfortable ride - especially on road trips. These components were also good: navigation / infotainment system; sound/speakers; heated, ventilated, & memory seats; rear leg room, enough power at passing speeds; 26 – 30 mpg at highway speeds; good dual zone climate control (ac & heat); adaptive cruise control; &On-star emergency assistance.

Cons: I experienced a total transmission failure at 38,000 miles (I bought the car new), leaving me in a cornfield far from home. Buick did not pay for all my reasonable rental car expenses. This whole experience cost me 16-hours plus some expenses due only to this Buick failure. After these initial repairs the car still required additional repairs on the transmission. I have lost trust in this car’s reliability & dependability. The car does not hold its resale value well. Buick will stop making this model, increasing my dissatisfaction. Limited trunk space. Restricted visibility at left and right sides of windshield. About 18-22 mpg around town. There was more road noise than I expected.

I am so disappointed, if I had known I would have bought a ""dumber"" car.  I have seen others describe issues with transmissions- is this similar issues?  How does the car know it has a new owner?

buick,lacrosse,2016,SaveTheManual, 02/15/2017,An adequate midsize sedan,3,"The rear window is extremely small resulting in large blind spots in the rear left and rear right of the car. The rear doors have smaller windows, which are fairly high in relation to a person sitting in the back. The cabin design, the side and position of the rear windows contribute to diminished visibility and nasty blind spots.The rear-view and the side view mirrors are incredibly small, also contributing to the limited visibility. The front driver seat, while being electronically adjustable, gives a driver the feeling like they are sitting on a moving platform. It is impossible to see the front end of the car no matter how high the front seat is positioned. The car has two control clusters, both in the form of a digital screens. The instrument cluster displays your speedometer and other options controlled by the steering wheel, while the second screen is in the center of the dash for the entertainment system. The left, up, right, and down directional buttons on the right side of the steering wheel navigate through menus displayed in the instrument cluster.  However, since there is no dedicated back button it is really confusing figuring out how to get out of them. The steering wheel has a very smooth feel which makes driving and parking effortless. The V6 engine seems fairly responsive and has a decent power output. However, It is paired with a transmission that sometimes gets confused in what gear it wants to shift. This is especially evident when flooring the gas pedal.

buick,lacrosse,2016,Steve H., 09/23/2016,Look Elsewhere,3,"The Lacrosse was a potential candidate to be a retirement gift to myself in a year or two.  I decided to rent one for a week to take on a 1,000 mile trip.  It is now off my list.  The first shortcoming is the cramped driving position.  I'm 6 foot, 190 lbs and the position is much tighter than it has to be.  The console flares as it approaches the dash reducing valuable seating real estate.  My right leg was constantly fighting the console trying to get my foot squarely on the accelerator pedal.  The foot well size is reduced by the intrusion of the wheel well.  The seat went back far enough, a big plus.  The dash seems to be close to the seating position and it curves as it approaches the door.  I hit it the corner twice during exiting.  Then there is the road noise.  It is unacceptable for a car of this supposed caliber.  The noise is intrusive starting about 35 mph on anything but smooth asphalt.  At highway speeds, it is a constant nuisance.  Thankfully, the wind noise is minimal, as it should be.  Handling was very excellent and the ride was OK, nothing worth noting.  Brakes, OK.   The climate control worked very well and the controls were easy to understand.  The entertainment system was another weak area.  The screen was a nice size, but distracting because of the scarcity of buttons on the dash.  The screen is tilted and so is the bezel which made is difficult to push the smallish station preset icons.  Everything has to be done via the two knobs and a couple of buttons or the touch screen.  Either way, it causes the driver to divert their attention from the road.  The sound was excellent and it was not the premium radio.  The powertrain (V6) was excellent, as was the gas mileage.  I averaged just over 30 mpg (calculated) for highway (mostly), suburban and in-town driving.  The trunk was nice and big and the fit and finish were excellent.    By contrast, I'm leasing a 2015 Verano which is superior in several areas.  It does not exhibit as high a level of road noise as the Lacrosse and the entertainment system is easier to use because it has buttons for things like the radio presets.  The driver's position is not as cramped, even though it is slightly smaller overall and the pedal feel of the brakes is better.  However, it is smaller and does not have the same ride comfort as the Lacrosse which runs 10-20k more.  Maybe the redesign will improve many of these deficiencies which would put the Lacrosse back on my list.

buick,lacrosse,2017,Richard Stewart, 12/09/2016,Good value for retired folks,4,"Being retired, I was looking for a quite comfortable roomy car with easy to use controls and lots of safety features for my wife and me to use for travel.  The Lacrosse fit the bill. I was impressed with all the safety features (love the heads up display) and the ease of use of the entertainment and navigation systems.  Most luxury cars don't have touch screens, which to me was a distraction.  The simpler the better.  The trunk on the Lacrosse is huge so no problems getting luggage stowed.  On the road the Lacrosse is very quiet and comfortable with plenty of power when you need it.  I was impressed with the overall mileage on the first fill up at 29.4 mpg with a 200 mile trip to PA and the rest mixed driving.  Some things I found troubling was there was no sunglass holder in the overhead (can use the space under the shifter, but still...), the visibility is not as good as I would have liked out the front when making turns and parking, and the transmission hunts a bit at low speed going up twisty hills (can shift into manual to smooth out).  People complain about the electronic shifter, but I found it easy to use once I got used to it. Overall I find the Lacrosse to fit my needs just fine and look forward to many miles of comfortable quite travel.
After 7500 miles the Intellilink display went blank then started a reboot that took two hours.  Happened twice in two weeks and took to dealer who found a bad module that would not allow for reading data. Part on order for three weeks and haven't heard back.

buick,lacrosse,2017,Captain Jack, 04/03/2017,Great value in a beautiful package,5,"Over the years I've owned BMW's, Mercedes, Audi's, GMC Yukons, Acadias and Sierras. They all have positives and negatives, but you can't beat the value built into the Buick. I enjoy driving a smooth and quiet sedan again, and like the car very much and especially like the lower payments, good gas mileage and affordable maintenance and insurance over all the fancy imports I've owned. And bye bye to the $1,000 per visit import luxury car maintenance visits. Even though SUVs are all the rage, this solid large sedan is a quiet, powerful, comfortable and confident buy.

2020 update. Succumbed to SUV Fever and traded for Enclave Avenir which is splendid and so much easier to get in and out of, and more flexible with space.

buick,lacrosse,2017,Bill A., 07/08/2017,A great car!,5,"I purchased a fully loaded 2017 Lacrosse with the premium trim level and couldn't be happier. I absolutely love the way it rides and handles, especially with the sport setting on. It has so many options I'm having a blast learning them all. It is by far the quietest, best riding, and best driving car I have ever owned. And I think it is the most stylish car on the market, not gaudy but sophisticated in its looks and styling. I tested a number of competitive models from Lexus, Kia, Hyundai, Nissan and Lincoln and they just didn't compare to this car. If you love to drive a luxurious, quiet yet great handling car, with plenty of power I highly recommend you take a look at the Lacrosse!
Update 1/17/18 - this is truly the best car I have ever owned. Can hardly believe the mileage I get. I drove to my mothers home and back and, while I admit to taking it easy, averaged over 38 mpg for a 200 mile trip! Unreal! Loving the adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist features as they make the car a pleasure to drive.  The adaptive cruise control is a real stress reducer, especially in heavy traffic. Just set it and let the car do the work. Buick has really done an outstanding job with this car.

buick,lacrosse,2017,Elwyn H. Davis, 01/09/2018,Best kept secret in automobiles,5,"We traded a 2010 Lacrosse CXS with 92,000 trouble free miles for this car 15 weeks ago.  Ours is the Premium trim level.  So far, in almost 5,000 miles we love the car and haven't found anything to complain about.  Among the great things:  Ride, smoothness of operation, seat comfort, Auto stop/start, gas mileage - 35 mpg on highway trips, 21-22 around town mileage, 24.2 overall probably 90% around town, easy to use technology, sound system, new style gear shifter, trunk size, quiet operation.  Our friends that have ridden in this car are blown away.  Before buying this car I test drove: Toyota Avalon, Chevy Impala, Lincoln MKZ, and Nissan Maxima.  None of these compared to the comfort, handling, styling, and overall perceived quality of the  2017 Buick Lacrosse.  To put things in perspective, this is the 12th new Buick we have purchased since 1966, and have only had one that was not terrific.  However, this is head and shoulders above all of the previous 11.  Buick hit a home run with this design.

buick,lacrosse,2017,Scott H, 12/14/2016,Rides like a rock,4,"I have a crimson red premium with the 20"" wheels and tires. What a mistake. I drove the 18"" version prior to getting mine and it was a floater. This one, equipped with RE97s rides like a go kart. And in sport mode it feels like you have no suspension at all. Now true, I'm a sporting sort of guy for an old geezer, but this car rides harder than a Vette or Z/28 that I've owned and its not in the same universe as my Pontiac G8 GT. At 500 miles I replaced the tires (at my expense) with Continental Extreme Contact DWS 06 and that helped a little. It still doesn't cure the issue that the suspension tuning is way off the charts. It's never still, never smooth.  Going to the dealer service dept. tomorrow, but I highly doubt there's anything that can be done as it's just the way the car is.  True, big wheels, but still a 40 series tire just like the 19s"" on my G8.  Why can the G8 ride light-years better on far more aggressive tires (RE-11s)?  Other than the above, no complaints.

Update:  I did take the car to the very helpful dealership because GM wouldn't talk to me unless I did.  Checked out 'nothing wrong' and 'to spec'' as expected.  I also got a chance to drive another new one with the 20"" wheels and tires with the hyper-strut and adaptive damping.  It was just as bad if not worse (as it had the OEM RE-97s).   I've asked the service manager to run this up the ladder with GM regional service folks to see if we can get engineering to take notice.  Hard to believe that they put this car out in the captured test fleet and this wasn't noticed, especially on Detroit streets.

Update at 1,300 miles.  Now that I'm getting a few miles on it, the suspension isn't quite as brittle as it was before.  Just got back from a 500 mile trip to the Detroit Auto Show where cruising at 80 mph up and back I got 30 mpg or just under.  Detroit city streets took the edge of of the ride a bit.  It's now in the range where I can tolerate it.  Comfy seats for long trips and extreme quiet help.  I got up there much more rested than past trips.  I may end up liking this car after all.

I had the Lacrosse for a two day drive and was actually surprised how I liked it. The styling both inside and out are much better than older Buicks, much nicer materials and fit and finish. It had a great ride and with the exception of a little road noise over some bad pavement, it was very quiet. There were a only a couple complaints about the car 1) needs more side bolstering in the driver's seat to hold you in better 2) typical GM needs to upgrade their sound system, it was ok but needs much deeper sounds 3) also typical GM needs to work on electronics, the automatic climate control kept turning the fan speed up and down to keep the car cooled where as my Toyota and Lincoln can do it without blasting the fans to maintain the set temp. Just small complaints to an other wise great road trip car.

buick,lacrosse,2017,James, 09/28/2017,A Great Car for long distance rides.,5,"I got a surprise upgrade from the rental car company - ""Buick LaCrosse Essence"" with 4k miles on the odo. I rented it for a day and travelled 500 miles. This is firmly the best car I have rented so far. I hesitated to accept the upgrade in the beginning because it had a 3.6 V6 engine and would eat up my pocket. Luckily NO! I was surprised by the fuel efficiency. 528 miles and I have just filled close to 16 gallons of fuel. For a full size car with a big engine and beasty acceleration, I did not expect this much milage. 10+ hours of drive without much of tiredness. It is a very silent car. Cruising at 70mpg, not a noise. You will doubt if the engine is actually running. It has a very rich interior and awesome driver's seat that feels very comfortable for long rides. The dashboard is ergonomically designed with most of the buttons in reach. However, the seating is too low and will sink you down such that you won't see much beyond the dashboard for city rides. Maybe it was because I am a short person (169cm). Otherwise, the car felt very very stable and smooth throughout the ride.

buick,lacrosse,2017,Greg Kelly, 11/07/2018,The Perfect Car for Road Warriors,4,"My wife and I were looking for a large, comfortable sedan for our frequent trips around the United States, and the 2017 Buick Lacrosse AWD was the perfect choice. It is comfortable and quiet on the inside, and holds the road extremely well, even in the snow. (Because of the low ground clearance, it does not do as well in deep snow.) We appreciate the ""out of site"" luggage space in the large trunk. The available in-vehicle wifi has been extremely useful, and the safety features such as the adaptive cruise control and the parking sensors have us totally spoiled. As for possible downsides: The ""Infotainment System"" has been useful and fun, but may be confusing for some older drivers. The voice recognition is a little sketchy. The autostop feature that shuts of the engine at intersections has worked perfectly, and should not be a concern. The electronically controlled gear shift took a little getting used to, but now I prefer it to a traditional gear shift.  Our only really negative experience in over 69,000 miles of driving has been a transmission failure. I started getting “Service Transmission” error messages in my 2017 Lacrosse at 26,000 miles. The dealer was unable to diagnose the problem, even with help from GM. Transmission problems continued to occur intermittently, including multiple error messages and rough shifting at low speeds. Finally, at over 68,000 miles, the transmission failed completely while the car was at the dealer. The solution was to replace the electronic transmission control module, an expensive repair. The car has since worked perfectly for the last 1200 miles.
Unfortunately, General Motors refused to honor the bumper to bumper warranty even though the problem first occurred below 30,000 miles and it took GM over 40,000 miles to solve the problem. They also claimed that this wasn’t a transmission repair, so they said it wasn’t covered in the powertrain warranty. They ended up covering 60% of the cost, which was better than nothing, but they did not do the honest thing and completely honor the warranty.
Update 11/08/2020: We are now at 139,000 miles, and have experienced no additional problems. It is still a great car to cruise the highways of America!

buick,lacrosse,2017,Firemedic1105, 02/18/2017,Buick sets new benchmark in Luxury Sedans,5,"""I own the redesigned 2017 Buick LaCrosse, Premium/AWD. Previously I drove the 2010 LaCrosse, purchased new and redesigned that year. My satisfaction with the previous generation was outstanding, delivering exceptional service and reaching nearly 80K miles at trade-in. The NEW generation LaCrosse for 2017 undoubtedly sets a higher benchmark for Domestic Luxury Sedans! In addition to its superior comfort and quietness while in motion, this model simply excels in technology and efficiency. Loaded with every safety feature imaginable, this Buick also includes the most advanced 3.6l VVT 310hp V-6 engine, that includes Auto Cylinder-Deactivation and Auto Start-Stop technology. These features collectively assure impressive gas mileage without compromising on rapid acceleration. The latest available, 8-speed auto transmission, is operated by a very intuitive, shift-by-wire control knob. Gear transitions are flawless at speed. Being completely fair & honest with such low mileage currently, I choose not to rate my experience in reliability. However, if this model meets or exceeds my experience with the 2010 Buick LaCrosse, I will surely give it a 10/10 as well. I have no doubts on the future of this car. Every Professional review that Ive researched, suggests that this Buick will indeed give most comparable Foreign Luxury Sedans a serious run for their money! ""
Update: My mileage is now just over 4K; I've experienced zero issues with performance and zero warranty claims. This vehicle remains such a pleasure to drive, both on local trips as well as long distances. It is so comfortable and quiet. The rear seat has proven itself to be very roomy and as comfortable for adult passengers. I am approaching the Winter season here in Wisconsin and will be anxious to assess the performance of the AWD system. 
UPDATE 2/28/18: We have are approaching the 3K milage and have been through a typical Wisconsin winter. I am very pleased to confirm that the AWD system performed flawlessly and provided sure-footed traction during the wet/snow/ice conditions that we've since encountered. We have not experienced any mechanical or build related issues with our new LaCrosse and consider it one of the comfortable vehicles we have ever owned.

buick,lacrosse,2017,Desiree, 06/06/2017,2017 Buick Lacrosse Pemium,5,"Overall I absolutely love this car. I will say that even though the car is FWD, the front sits really low. I'm constantly worried about taller curbs when parking. You have to watch your head getting in the car (I'm 5'6) because the headroom is low and the seats sit low. If you raise the seat to drive, there is a chance of bumping your head upon getting out the vehicle. Thanks for the built in rear view camera because due to the shape of the rear window and the incline of the rear end, that camera is well needed. I was a little upset about the lack of a CD player. But I guess if you can learn to use the electronic trans. shifter, then you can learn how to use USB cords and the Bluetooth to play music from your phone. I absolutely love the engine and all the bells and whistles including the all the pretty moon-light ambient lighting throughout the vehicle when park/headlights are activated.
"
buick,lacrosse,2017,Pat, 02/04/2017,Good but I would wait till GM gets it right.,3,"I had turned in my 2015 Impala and was looking for another sedan. I had driven the Chrysler 300 and the Lexus ES 350. My local Buick dealer let me take the Lacrosse  for the weekend to give it a thorough test drive. While the car has many positive attributes, there are few major issues that kept me from buying it. First the good: The engine and transmission are a dream and provide smooth, quick, fuel efficient operation. The engine has strong exceleration and utilizes cylinder deactivation on the highway. I  achieved an incredible 31 mpg highway which is very good for this size of car. The 8 speed transmission is the best I have ever driven and unlike other 8 speeds, it doesn't hunt back and forth for the right gear. It shifts so imperceptibly, there were many times I had no idea what gear I was in. Very Nice! Lastly, you can order Adaptive Cruise with an 18"", 19"" or 20"" tire so you can get a comfortable, bump absorbing tire without having to be pushed into a package of options that includes hard riding 20"" tires. Now the bad: I don't know who they are designing these front seats for but I'm a small guy, 175 lbs and the seat was too narrow for my legs and thighs. I've seen this in Cadillacs as well. Hello GM! Side seat bolsters are for THIGH SUPPORT, not to SIT ON or increase pressure on driver/front passenger legs! The bucket seat width narrows towards the seat back so much that my uppers legs were sitting directly ON the side bolsters. After 20 miles, the backs of my upper legs were hurting from the pressure.  This absolutely killed the car for me which is too bad. The seat cushion itself was pretty comfy but the side bolsters were unbearable and my salesman said he had heard the same complaint from other potential customers as well. The next issue was overall quality with the car having a ""cheap feel"" to it. The rear, fold down seat back  would not latch and lock  in the upright position. The exposed, stationary latch mechanism attached to the back trunk wall (with grease all over it)  was locked in the closed position so it couldn't engage with the seat back. I looked at it for several minutes trying to figure it out but could not get it to release. Looking into the trunk from the rear I saw polyester white foam stuffed in behind the trunk wall and the seat back that was coming loose and falling out. I have no idea where this foam was supposed to go or what it's purpose was.  The morning I was supposed to return it, the battery died and I had to charge it. Then an error light came on referring to  a transmission problem. This car had only 700 miles on it and cost $43,000 +,  you just shouldn't have these kinds of problems!  My 15' Impala was perfect and trouble free for the duration of my 24 month lease. It's seats were wide, supportive and comfortable. The car was quiet, and had great build quality and materials. I wish I could take this advanced engine and transmission and put it in the 2017 model I ended up purchasing. The bad thing about the Impala (again, Hello GM!) is I got pushed into a 20"" tire to get my adaptive cruise which I will  be quickly trading out for more comfortable riding 18"" tires. The 20"" tires transmit every road imperfection and make for a very hard, uncomfortable ride. I know, they look very cool but to me, it's not worth the sacrifice in comfort.  I've researched how the adaptive cruise works and talked to my engineering friends in the auto industry  and contrary to popular belief, you can change tire sizes without any problems.

It is a triumph of American manufacturing superiority. This is my fourth Lacrosse in 7 years and it is the best yet. The car is comfortable and performs well on both long drives and in the city. I have had no mechanical or technological issues with the vehicle since purchase in November '17. On a recent trip from western North Carolina to south Florida the car averaged 34mpg.

buick,lacrosse,2017,Hauskapoika, 05/07/2018,Exceptional,5,"At 22,000, no problems or issues to report.   On smooth roads, this car is almost silent; on rough roads, there is some noise, but the car is very stable.  The best gas mileage, around town, was 21.48 mpg.  Best gas mileage on the road was 29.82 mpg. Back seat leg room on this car is enormous. The car handles very well, for not being a hot rod or sports car, and has the optional handling package.  Special likes: blind spot warning system, digital speedometer, back up camera, heated seats, separate seat controls, GPS which works very well, and trans is very smooth.   We do not use Onstar for phone calls because we already carry a cell phone, and it connects seamlessly to blue tooth in the car.  The back up camera is especially useful in crowded parking lots because it can spot and notify on traffic, people, and objects from the side that I can't see otherwise. This car is a really good highway cruiser, and it is lively around town too.  This car has just about everything you can get on a car, and at first, there is a learning curve for all the controls and gadgets.  My wife is partially disabled and she is able to get in and out of the car fairly easily.  No leaks or squeaks and no oil consumption.  This car has the 20"" aluminum wheels which are pretty, but I am told the 18"" wheels and tires give you an even smoother ride.  At 22,000 miles, one issue: A burned out tail light bulb which the dealer replaced for free.  No recalls or problems with this car. Still discovering new things about this car, especially steering wheel controls such as cruise control, tire pressure readings, and other options and info on this car.  One thing all car owners, who have GPS in their vehicle are experiencing is new communities and roads are being built everywhere, and if the vehicle is a couple of years old, these changes will not be on your GPS unless you get the updates offered by the manufacturer.  Buick is offering an update right now for $100.

I got a great deal on the Lacrosse since they were running a Memorial Day special with a 16% discount. I built the car I wanted on Edmonds.com at noon and had three offers that were much less than I expected by the end of the day, the lowest of which was from Wilkins Buick in Glen Burnie, MD. The dealer was able to find the exact car I wanted and had it ready for me to pick up in just a couple of days.  I love the interior and exterior styling and the extensive technological features which were very intuitive to learn.

buick,lacrosse,2017,Jerry Adamson, 02/10/2017,Auto stop sucks,3,"This car has an engine auto stop program in it that shuts off the engine at every stop to save gas.  The transmission jerks when it shuts off and starts up.  It feels like someone just ran into the rear of the car when it starts up.  This program will not let you come to a smooth stop before the engine stops.  Then after the engine stops and it needs to start up again to operate the air conditioning, the car jumps ahead when the engine starts up again.  Impossible to creep forward slowly.  It is very annoying, aggravating and uncomfortable feeling.  There is no way one can shut off this auto stop program.  If I knew that this was going to happen, I would not have bought this car.  Everything else in or on the car is great.

buick,lacrosse,2017,Mike C, 07/01/2017,Great but noisy ride,3,"On smooth paved roads this cars has a db reading of 70 to 74 db which is pretty good.  However we recently completed a cross country trip for Florida to Washington State and on rough roads the cabin noise is very high 80 to 85 db, bumps in the road come right through the suspension and there is very noticeable and annoying vibration transmitted through to the rear view mirror.  On the exposed aggregate paving on roads around Seattle the road noise was so loud we could only hear the audio but turning it up to a very high level.  Now that we are back in Florida on smooth roads the ride is OK but there is still a  small vibration evident in the rear view mirror which seems to be coming through the body frame.  The interior quality is excellent and the seats are very  comfortable but the noise problem makes me regret purchasing this vehicle.  

One year on after purchase and all of the above still hold true.  Had the dealer check the noise and rear view mirror vibration and he indicated they are both endemic in this model.  No fix available from Buick except to perhaps look into buying a new set of 'softer' riding tires.

I would push the gas pedal after the stop lighted changed, and the car hesitated. Obvious transmission issues. I pulled over and called the dealership. They told me to go home and bring it back in the morning. I told them I was afraid of being stranded. I brought it back and they gave us a loaner. It now runs great!

buick,lacrosse,2017,C Stein, 07/16/2018,Old enough to buy a comfortable car,5,"Surprising long distance mileage of 34 mpg to Oregon and back from SoCal. I drove 15 hours straight each way and was less tired than any car I have driven. Great style and finish.

buick,lacrosse,2017,Tracey Lewis, 11/16/2018,Enjoy the Ride,4,"I bought my Lacrosse in July 2017. In October 2018, the serial gateway module that controls the instrument panel had to be replaced. My dealer said that he had never serviced this problem before so it may have just been a fluke as others were not having similar issues. Other than this, I loved owning this car - with one exception. The auto stop/start which helps save fuel is annoying. I would have liked to have been able to disable it. I traded this car for personal reasons and was disappointed in its resale value.

buick,lacrosse,2017,Chuck Beger, 04/17/2019,Test drove many cars. This was IT within 10 miles,5,"Be prepared to drive with a smile on your face.  I flew to Detroit from Minneapolis due to a great price and was going to drive it the 750 miles home in one day.  That's a lot of miles but by the time I got 2/3 the way home I called a friend in Nebraska and went there just to put on more miles.  I absolutely LOVED the car and couldn't seem to get enough drive time!  I put on 900+ miles that day and then another 600 miles the next.  It was 99% freeway and I had the adaptive cruise set at 85 -88 most of the way.  That car got 28.5 MPG during those 1500 miles at that speed.   I bought the Premium II package with nearly every option that was available.  The most impressive option is the ""Driver Confidence II"" package which comes with 2 different self parking programs (parallel and pull-in), sensors all over the place so I get warned while pulling out of a parking stop from between 2 vans blocking my view, front collision avoidance braking, warnings if I am not paying attention to the steering wheel,  and much more.  While backing out of a parking slot my seat will vibrate on the left side if that's where danger is coming from and the right if danger is coming from the right.  The same is true if I try to change lanes with a vehicle in my blind spot.  Not only is there warning lights on my mirrors but the seat will vibrate on that side.  That vibration is not always gentle.  If I'm coming up on something way too fast I get both sides vibrating enough that it would wake up a snoring, sound sleeper!   Consumer Reports said not to get this car with the 20"" rims/tires because it wouldn't be the ""Buick ride"".  Phewy!!  I have these 20"" beauties and am extremely happy with them.  They grip the road like a sports car and are not at all harsh riding.  If this is what CU deems ""not a Buick ride"" then the softer riding 17"" rims/tires must put the car in the Rolls Royce stratosphere.   The noise level is super low.  Conversations at 80 MPH are at living room level.   I have the sun roof that is very quite when wide open at hwy speeds.   The car came with the headlights that turn with the steering wheel in order to see the road around the corner which is fantastic on a dark country road at midnight.  I can think of nothing that I dislike about this beautiful car.  I get compliments all the time from perfect strangers which, of course, makes me smile as I drive off.  With over 300 HP and All Wheel Drive it is a dream to pull out onto a heavy traffic highway and get from 0-65 in about 7-8 seconds.   It doesn't take much of a gap in traffic to get in and merge without anyone honking or having to slow down even a tad.   This car really lays me back into the seat if needed.  Sorry that this is so long but after 18 months and 35,000 miles I still get a thrill every time I get in it and take off for parts to be determined.
   Well, I've asked by Edmunds to update my review.  Nothing has changed since I raved about it before.  I'm still in love with this car.  Great gas mileage (28 mpg overall), super quiet ride, silent/smooth shifting, great power (fun!) and handling that would make my Camaro Z28 slightly envious.  What's not to love?
"
buick,lacrosse,2017,RyanLasVegas, 10/26/2018,Great car! Don't listen to whiners about start sto,5,"First, comparing to other cars in this class, it is a great car over all. I compared this car to a Maxima, Impala and a 300. All cars were good in their own right. Maxima Sporty, 300 roomy, Impala a good blend of both. Buick was not even on my radar, and yes, I did think ""Buick? I'm not grey yet...."" but yeah, just like the commercial says, it's not your fathers Buick... What drew me to this car was it was better than  those over cars overall. This car as well as the others I've compared has the 3.6 V6. Essence package. Good room for family, good power for in and out traffic, nice interior and exterior, and smooth ride. I dont know what the other reviewers were complaining about. Take it for a test drive, if you can, a nice long one, not just around the block like some dealerships have you do. Mess around with the features. All cars has that break in period to learn where things are and how things work. Watch and read reviews, and yeah, you'll get some nit picky reviews, but overall I think you will find that this is a great car. Additionally, the 4 yr bumper to bumper, 6 yr power train, 2 yr service and road side, and paint and rust warranty is hard to beat. So you could go with Lexus, Cadillac, or some other high end luxury and probably spend 20k more. If you want all the bells and whistles and AWD yeah, you get up there. But for an entry level luxury that's nicely equipped. You get a good car for price. Lastly, for all the nay sayers about the auto start stop. 1. I've driven many worse cars that has auto start stop and this one is the best by far... only noticed if you really let it bug you or pay attention to it. 2. I live in Nevada, so a way to by pass the function is to set your climate control to Max, not eco and run the AC. At first, I didn't think the auto start stop was working. But then I messed with the controls. If you do this it puts a draw on the battery and engine and your car stays running in my experience. Not that it saves on gas. If you drive a hybrid, it feels similar at the start. So my impression is good family car that is well designed inside and out. Power and handling is smooth. Priced competitively against rivals. Trim level, go with Essence if you want well equipped for price.

buick,lacrosse,2017,John Baril, 01/09/2019,Base model LaCrosse anything but base,5,"Perhaps one of the most underrated cars sold in the U.S., even the base model LaCrosse is extremely well-equipped (Apple Car Play, Homelink, rear parking sensors) and is really beautiful.  Also typically Buick-quiet.  I've owned BMWs, Mercedes-Benzes, Lincoln, Jaguar, VWs, Audi, et al.  Except where some of these might be superior (sport sedan handling), the Buick, IMHO, is as well put together and aesthetically pleasing.

Complained to dealer. Showed service builletin #03-03-10-007j. Tires get a flat spot when not being driven, and should be driven at least 15 miles to get rid of flat spots.

buick,lacrosse,2017,BBC, 08/30/2017,I Hate Auto Stop!,1,"Don't buy. Auto/Stop is a terrible feature. Every time you come to a stop the engine turns off. When you lift your foot off the break the car starts and you can feel the transmission engage. You need a neck brace to drive this car. Car seems like it's always banging in and our of gear. If you slow down then hit the gas the car lunges forward. I hate driving this car. This is my 3rd and last LaCrosse. My last Buick as well. So far I have not been able to turn this feature off.

buick,lacrosse,2017,Robert Siegel, 01/25/2018,Auto-Stop and Adaptive Cruse Control is fantastic.,5,"This car is absolutely fantastic. Yes, it costs way more than a Camry or Accord, which I have also owned. The start-stop does not use the starter and battery. Instead, the computer keeps track of where cylinders are to restart. The car restarted once while I was stopped at a light because the air need to come back on, it did surprise me. However, under normal driving you don't even know that there is start-stop working. The engine is running after you take your foot off of the brake and before you can get to the gas. It does not turn off until the speedometer reads 0. The adaptive cruise uses about one car length per 10 MPH on the closest setting, I wish it had a closer setting for highway driving. I use  adaptive cruise all the time, even in town at 25 MPH. It accelerates using the best gas mileage.  At 70 MPH, I'm getting 34 MPG. This car is great! Still the best car I have ever owned. Too bad it's being discontinued!

buick,lacrosse,2017,Larry M. Fierstine, 06/11/2017,Not Happy,2,"I purchased a 2017 Buick Lacrosse Essence in Dec. 2016. The vehicle has 1550 mi., and has been in the shop twice for wind noise and rattles. The first time the car was in the shop for a recall, I mentioned the wind noise and rattles, the car was in overnight, a part was needed to fix the wind noise, a week later the part came in, had it installed , did not fix the problem, the car stay for an entire week. The jury is still out on the wind noise, but still has rattles. A plastic water bottle in the cup holder rattles. I don't want to have the car constantly in the shop, so I am driving it as is, and will address rattles at the next recall. Design flaws , my wife(5'4"") and I(6') can not get in or out without bumping our heads, roomy luxury! The pass thru is worthless, nothing can safely be retrieved from it unless you stop and crawl into the car to get what you want. The arm rest on the center counsel is to short and does not slide forward for comfort. The cubbies in the doors are horrible, your can not get sunglasses out because the decorative plastic won't allow access to retrieve them from the cubby without again stopping and reaching with your other hand to get the sunglasses. The rear window comes so far back that if interferes with the access to the trunk. Do not try to load a normal set of luggage. I noticed in your article  you used one medium bag for the pictures. One of the rear seat releases came loose, I was asked by the dealer if I had overloaded the trunk, I replied it is for cargo? To say we are unhappy is an understatement. We expected more for our $45,000 purchase. Never again, Larry M. Fierstine

buick,lacrosse,2017,James, 01/07/2017,Not loyal anymore.,4,"I was sad to learn that I would have to spend $40k just to get leather seats. Also if I want the nice ""Bose"" stereo I would have to buy a ""package"" that would include Navigation and a bunch of other useless ""safety"" features you really don't need if your paying attention. They don't put michelin tires on their premium sedans anymore. Really? I'm done with GM. I currently drive a 2015 lacrosse. I really think they took the wrong direction and that new gear shifter. Its the same one that they put in the Cruze I think.?  I am now looking at the new Continental. They have little ""package"" games too. If you compare a loaded Lacrosse which is $50k to other competitors I think the decision becomes much clearer. If I am going to spend $50k on car it isn't going to be a Buick. Sorry GM.

buick,lacrosse,2017,PaulC, 08/31/2017,Luxury car ride with economy car seat comfort,3,"Ride of the base sedan I rented for 4 days was smoother, quieter and more free of vibration than any car I have driven the past two years - better than Toyota Avalon, Lexus ES350, Lincoln Continental, Impala.  But the seats are uncomfortable.  The seat bottom is hard so the pressure points cause soreness and fatigue to set in within 15 minutes. And the seat back lacks sufficient lumbar support even when the power control is set for maximum support.  Powertrain is smooth and quiet.  Air conditioner cold and powerful.  Gearshift control is unconventional and unintuitive - took me 5 minute to figure out how to shift into reverse.  Ironically, I find several much less expensive full sized cars have more comfortable front seats than the Buick Lacrosse, Toyota Avalon and Lincoln Continental; e.g. the 2018 Toyota Camry and 2017 on up Kia Optima.  As a potential buyer seeking ride and seat comfort, at present my favorite prospect so far is the 2018 Camry LE or XLE as it offers near LaCrosse levels of ride comfort and quietness with much softer, more better shaped seats and superb directional stability on the highway - all important characteristics for fatigue free long distance cruising.

buick,lacrosse,2017,Buick LaCrosse 2017 PremiumAWD, 12/04/2018,"Terrible front seat, shakes and vibrates",2,"I researched A LOT before I bought this car...On paper it looked great...Huge, comfortable, full of tech, all safety features...I found a great deal on it 30% off with only 3000 miles on...I test drove it for 30 min on back roads and 5 minutes on highway...everything was OK...soft ride, quiet, smooth. I bought it and was very exited. Until I drove it on windy highway with steep incline/decline...The front driver seat is terrible, pressure on both buttocks, possibly because of the stiff safety vibration thing on the sides of the seats. When speed is above 60, vibration is very noticeable under the seat. The whole car shakes when speed approaches 80. Transmission shifts up and down and car kicks front and back when going uphill. I drove it for 1500 miles, still can't find a comfortable position to sit, even with seat cushion. The car waddles all the time, and I get motion sickness...I LOVED the car before I bought it...now I can't even drive it because I get butt pain and sickness in my stomach...I can't believe I am saying it...but I miss my Corolla LE...with it's mere 128 hp and terrible wind noise and revving engine uphill and downhill...at least I could put earbuds and forget about the road...this one keeps rocking and jerking me, and I am stuck with it...

Update after 2 years:

Car continues to jerk and shake...Transmission is terrible...kicks with each gear change...especially in cold weather. Tires worn out after only 35k miles... Bose subwoofer makes loud buzz with each beat...

I can't wait to get rid of this car...

buick,lacrosse,2017,D Dahl, 07/21/2017,Incorrectly thinks it knows what's right (always),2,"My wife and I rented a LaCrosse for a week in Colorado. We put more than 1000 miles on the car during this time. Pros: The seats are comfortable and the ride is nice. Cons: The controls and instrumentation are awful. The gear shift is very un-intuitive and you cannot go easily from manual shift mode back to automatic without going into neutral. The back-up camera comes on in reverse (duh), but it does not turn off until you roll forward for a while in a forward gear; this is distracting and unlike all the other cars I have driven. The paddle shifters are worse; it's very easy to hit them accidentally, at which point you *have* to shift via them; there is no easy way to go back into full automatic mode... you just wait until GM decides it's the right time to return to auto mode. The engine turns off when you come to a stop... sometimes... others it doesn't. The headlight controls are hidden by your left hand if you drive using 9-3 or 10-2 hand position. The touchscreen must be used for climate control and it's arcane and opaque in terms of getting the air set just right. The audio system controls on the touchscreen were such that I just turned the volume to zero to avoid having to deal with it (why no just turn it off? you ask... well, when I tried that, it turned off the whole touch screen along with the climate control). Overall, the user interface with this car is what I would expect from sophomore level design students who did not have enough time to complete their semester project. If it were simply a matter of getting used to different controls I would be more forgiving, but the controls o this car are just plain bad and would be a nagging irritation for as long as it's owned. Also, the gas tank is small and I had to hit the pumps more often than I expected. Not recommended at all.

buick,lacrosse,2017,Sebastian S., 03/07/2019,"Bought Buick as a dream car, living a nightmare",3,"Buick LaCrosse may be a great car if GM could just honor the warranty. I own this new car for over a year. From the start it was plagued with problems. After 9 dealer visits, 3 GM/Buick customer service cases and e-mails to GM's vice president for Buick, I am still driving with a very bothersome creaking/flapping noise coming from the front passenger door. Dealers can't figure it out, GM does nothing to help. Their customer service is atrocious, better said, non-existent.
Update: it's been one and a half year, I spent more time, wrote more letters, GM opened more customer service (they should not use the term) cases.
I also found rust on the door molding and on the car. They (partially) cleaned the rust but didn't resolve the issue.
People advised me not to buy an american car. GM proves them right.
I welcome a GM executive who wants to have a dialog with me. I'd love to help them understand where they can make improvements. 
They won't, though. Gave them plenty of chances already.

buick,lacrosse,2017,Christopher Edgar, 09/14/2019,"So far so good, but transmission is worrying",3,"I've had my LaCrosse Essence for 3 years and 13k miles, leased, and it was my intention to purchase it once the lease ends, but I'm not so sure now.

Good: This vehicle has been smooth and comfortable for the most part, so far.  It's got some power, is quiet, has a smooth ride and is fun to drive.  The gas mileage, while not what I hoped, is not terrible.

It's got a really stylish interior design.  Buick's Intellilink has an elegant look to it, and the navigation software looks much better than others I've seen, particularly with the 3D view.

Disappointing/Bad: The #1 concern for this vehicle is the transmission.  It hasn't been as bad for me as it has been for some people, but I noticed it shifts poorly when you slow down to a near stop then give it gas again.  Does a sedan like this really need an 8-speed transmission?  Will it fail for me at 70k miles like it has in one complaint?  GM is not known for reliability (particularly automatic transmissions) and quality these days, but I heard that Buick was not like the rest.  I'm worried that it might be, and the well-known clunky transmission is not a good sign.

The stop-start, overall, doesn't bother me as much as it does other people, but it definitely seems like a waste.  Beyond the unpredictability of it engaging properly, I have another concern: what's the point of a stop-start system that will only shut off the engine for 20 or so seconds then start it again, whether you move or not?  I don't know why (maybe battery drain?) but it won't stay auto-stopped for any longer than that.

The navigation interface is definitely clunky, and I agree with another reviewer that the climate controls are unintuitive and arcane.  But I've grown used to it, even to the weird gear shift knob/system, and could live with it.

I am pretty disappointed in the stereo system.  I paid for the upgraded Bose system, but I suspect the head unit just doesn't put out enough power to make the speakers come alive.  Feels like it has no midbass, no kick.  In fact, despite Buick angling to get rid of the ""car for old people"" reputation, the stereo system comes off as...  a stereo system for old people.

Conclusion: Overall I love the car, and could live with all problems but one: the poorly-designed transmission that signs seem to indicate won't make it to 100k, or maybe even 60k, miles.  That's the unforgivable sin GM is known for, and I am afraid they have committed it here.  I suspect I may give up on buying the car and let the lease expire.  I don't trust the transmission design to drop more money into this car, and I will not reward Buick by paying them to replace a defectively-designed transmission.

Add on top of that the whole bailout thing combined with GM closing so much U.S. production anyway, and I have little inclination to be forgiving toward them.  I've owned 3 GM cars, one of which, a 1999 Saturn SL-2, didn't last 6 years because of an engine defect that required 4 engine replacements -- I should have learned my lesson then.  This will be my last.

I also do not like the fact that the gas tank door is now on the passenger side which is opposite of the Buick I last had.  Why should a person have to walk around their car to out gas in!!   On the plus side, after test driving different makes, the Buick seems more sound and better quality. 
One year later I find that I Hate the shift--why pot that extra P (park) to the side on the shift.  I also think the climate control should be on a separate button rather than on the screen which is hard to turn the A/C on when driving.

buick,lacrosse,2017,SC Gator, 05/12/2019,Excellent year-end purchase - very comfortable,5,"We were looking for a large, comfortable sedan with great leg room and a big trunk for taking long road trips.  The original MSRP was $41.6K and the car had all the extra features that we wanted.  We've had the car for just over one year and think it was a very good purchase.  The ride quality is very good and quiet cabin will probably improve when the slightly noisy OEM 18"" Continental tires are replaced with Michelin Defenders.  On nine highway trips of more than 250 miles each totalling 3,800 miles, we averaged 32.7 mpg with a high of 35 and a low of 29 on individual tanks.  The gear shift selector is manageable but Park can inadvertantly be selected when looking for Reverse - not a great replacement for the long standing P, R, N, Dr, Low arrangement and a questionable piece of engineering.  The V6 engine has plenty of power for good acceleration on to expressways and for passing on two lane roads.  The 8 speed automatic shifts smoothly and has no trouble finding the correct gear.  Navigation screen and radio were replaced under warranty and the quality of dealer support was excellent.  The backup camera and the side traffic warnings work well, as rear visibility is slightly hampered.  The car does sit low and it is slightly more difficult for older people to get in and out of the front seats easily than in our previous Buick Lucerne.  Very little to complain about and would recommend the car that we consider stylish and comparable to vehicles costing considerably more."

buick,lacrosse,2017,Wes G., 03/05/2020,First time GM owner and I LOVE this car!,4,"Having owned many brands of cars I never expected to love a Buick as much as I do. I was out shopping for two year old cars and driving barely used Genesises, K900s, Volvos and Audi A6s. I randomly stopped at a Buick dealer and they had a Lacrosse just in off of lease in the back I spotted while looking at something else. I opened the passenger door, sank into the super soft seats and finally said “AHA!” The seats in all those other cars are very firm and I just couldn’t justify getting out of a more comfortable Kia Optima for no other reason than I needed a bigger car for carrying passengers. 
I searched hard until I found one for sale as there weren’t many made and I wanted a blue one which was only made for 2017. I bought it and love it! The seats are like nothing else in it’s class and after 3 hours of driving in Atlanta traffic I now find I’m calm and my body isn’t tense or hurting from a more firm German style seat. My only complaints would be that there are no heated rear seats. This seems small but even my Optima had that along with cooled/ventilated seats. I shouldn’t have to buy the top of the line to get either of those at the price point of the Essence which was $45k new. My Optima also had a heated steering wheel (only available on the top level even though the button is already there on the wheel) and the stereo on it blew this Bose Centerpoint out of the water. No matter how I adjust this stereo it sounds hollow and like a step back to cars from last century. Yes it booms, but it sounds empty whereas other cars seem to surround you better nowadays. 
Also the navigation seems to have it’s own mind at times when it tells me I’m “off-road” when I’m clearly sitting at a 6 lane highway intersection. 
Even though it does that I still love the car! I love how it drives and it often surprises me when laying into a curve, even without the Sport drive package. It’s a unique car to own but I’d advise taking it on a long test drive before purchasing and to try the NAV and stereo too. I

The car has a bunch of leg room and the inside cabin eliminates all outside noise, to be honest it is a little over the price tag I am looking for but I had to compromise since it is the perfect full size sedan and I am disappointed that they are discounting this model. Overall great car without all the unnecessary flash!

buick,lacrosse,2018,mr-prl, 04/23/2019,Happiness is starting to set in,4,"Update 1/5/2020:  I'm up to 23k now and after the shorting wire harness issue was resolved i'm a much happier LaCrosse Driver now.  Car consistently gets 38-40 mpg on my commute to work.  I sometimes start to feel this car getting a little noisy, but then i drive a Honda or Toyota and realize once again how quiet this car is.  I will continue to update as i plan on putting 200k over on this over the next few years. 
Just recently purchased my 2018 Buick Lacrosse with 6k miles.  Issue # 1 is the USB ports do not work nor does the Wireless Charger.  Issued # 2, my car has recently developed a very loud very annoying whining sound coming from the Engine / Transmission.  This reminds me of previous day fords when the power steering fluid gets low.  Off to dealer tomorrow.  Very very disappointed as of this writing as i purchased the car to get to and from work not the dealership for repairs.

buick,lacrosse,2018,Jack, 11/03/2018,Makes Me Feel Good,5,"This is the fourth Buick that we have owned and so far it meets or exceeds our expectations. The ride is only surpassed by the 2004 Park Ave. that we put well over 200,000 miles on. Still getting use to all the features that we as seniors need to work at to understand how they work! Love the feel of the way it handles and the gas millage. Have only been on one road trip so far and was very  happy with everything. Love the way the head lights follow the road when you go around corners and the back-up camera is a must. Also getting use to the E-assist and the way it shuts down and restarts by itself. Overall very happy with it.

buick,lacrosse,2018,Janet, 02/28/2019,What a deal!,5,"Bought my 2018 two weeks ago. I was considering the new Nissan Altima or the Kia Optima based on reviews. Stopped in the Buick dealership on a whim and they made me a deal I could not refuse.  The dealership's manager had driven the car for a while and put 4,000 miles on it, so they discounted the sticker price by $10k.  My 2018 came with upgraded V6 engine, which has lots of 'giddy-up'.  I love the interior look; classy but not pretentious.  The cargo space is plenty for me and my hubby.  Speaking of my husband; he is 6'4 and 300 lbs.  He gets in and out of the Lacrosse with ease - which says a lot! He has plenty of head and leg room due to both front seats having power adjustments that can set for instant recall.  If you download the ""Android Auto"" app on your smartphone and then connect to the USB port then you do not need a navigation system, or even SIRIUS.  The infotainment system in the Lacrosse uses your phone's google maps, and all other bluetooth apps, including Pandora, etc.  right there on the dash screen! (why pay for an upgraded infotainment system?)  We didn't even have a Buick on our radar while car shopping, but we are very happy that we decided to pull into the dealer's lot!

buick,lacrosse,2018,Greg A, 06/30/2019,"Quick, smooth and refined 2018 3.6 premium FWD",5,"Purchsed this one year old car to replace a Malibu 2.0T lease. After leasing the Malibu for 3 years I was done with it mainly for 2 reasons: No spare with the 19"" tires (wife popped 2 of them at $300 ea.) and the required premium gas  at a 50 cent premium, with mediocre around town mileage as low as 14-15mpg in the winter, although on trips have seen over 40mpg. Otherwise except for the ride has been a good car with plenty of power and no reliability problems.
When it came time to replace it I decided basically on 2 items that were a must...namely a spare tire and the ability to run on regular gas. i also have doubts about the long term reliability of all of these 4 cyl turbo motors which almost all manufacturers are using now .I like some power in a car so NA 4 cyl cars were not in consideration. The only sedans with V6 engines in 2018 model year which I was looking for were Chevy Impala, Camry,  Avalon, and Korean larger cars. The V6 Camrys were too costly compared to the lacrosse, The Impala, although less expensive is a good 6 inches longer than the Lacrosse. The Avalon was reasonably priced but lacked a lot of features and the Technology was universally panned. I would not consider Korean makes. The Maxima looks nice but requires premium gas and has a CVT transmission and is a bit small. So I decided on the Lacrosse although there are not many 1 year old examples for sale because of their limited production numbers.
I did find a nice example with only 14,000 miles and after a short time my wife and I are very happy with  it. It is beautiful in and out. The interior in particular is impressive along with the long list of features. Seats are very comfortable, the ride is compliant but still handles very well and the cabin is very quiet. I am very impressed with the 3.6L powertrain which is smooth and quick. Car & Driver had the 0-60 time at 5.6 secs. Whereas the Malibu was getting 16-17mpg around town, the Buick is getting 19-20 and on regular gas. On the mileage history readout the best MPG was indicated at 43mpg and that is with a full size car with a 310HP engine which I find incredible.
The car has heated-cooled memory and massaging  seats, HUD, All latest Tech except Nav (which is not needed with Apple car play) HID articulating  Headlights, Blind Spot monitoring,
Lane keep assist, rear parking sensors, and a ton more. This car has the standard audio system which I think is at least as good as the Bose system in the Malibu. The only option I would have liked would be the panoramaric sunroof and maybe one of the optional colors.
Summing up for the cost of a new base Camry or Accord I acquired a 1 year old premium car
with a full warranty that easily meets or surpasses all expectations.

After less than 2k miles belt tensioner pully bearing started making a super loud humming noise.  Took car to my local dealer and they repaired a few days later.  Jump to a couple months later and now check engine light stays on constant.  Current code U0293 lost communication with Hybrid Powertrain Module.  Dealer did not have time to diagnose until a week later.  Driving car home 1 night every warning light on dash illuminated, dash reset multiple times.

buick,lacrosse,2019,jimc, 03/29/2019,autostop and intellilink need serious review,3,"Some things about this years model much worse than 2012 model I had. Shifting, when coming to a stop, car feels like it upshifts as you slow down so you feel a sudden increase in rolling speed as you try to come to a stop. (As if you shifted to neutral while trying to stop.) Must make more forceful routine stops. Parking light comes on randomly when shifting to park. Entertainment system, ipod cuts out randomly, so far on every trip in car, (never occurred on 2012 lacrosse) Navigation system, please correct the logic of the controls when you are trying to add a contact and give it a name like a friends house when you don't always remember their address. Present layout is enter full address and save, exit system, relocate the address and edit it so you can give it a name. Why can't you name the contact at same time you enter it. Spent 15 minutes at dealer with infotainment expert as he fumbled to figure it out. Inability to disable autostop. No problem for red lights, great idea.Terrible in heavy traffic. Please tell me what GM used for start stop cycles/day for starter when this decision was made. Ride comfort is very good and cabin is quiet. I'm sure some of these things I'll adjust to, just shouldn't have to. Don't overtech the cars or you'll end up with a Boeing 737-800 MAX!! Not all technology is good technology and change for the sake of change should never be confused with improvement!!

buick,lacrosse,2019,Kevin S., 03/11/2019,Most Improved Player,5,"This is the second LaCrosse the family has purchased. The first was a 2013. Each car is as comparably equipped as could be. The new one is a much better car. The tech features have obviously improved between now and 2013. The back up camera with the guide that twists and turns as the wheel does, for example. The adaptive cruise is a cool feature. The posted speed limit indicator is helpful. The lane centering feature I'm not so sure about. It makes adjustments, but very slowly. I think you could easily drift into an on coming lane if you fell asleep. The smart seat feature is a little scary sometimes, but it is definitely helpful. The seat vibrates if the cameras detect a possible collision, thankfully I've only noticed this at slow speeds, parking lots, backing out of the garage, etc. The interior layout is better, and has better materials and touch points. The direct shifter takes a little getting used to, but it works well. In the older one I always felt like the car was floating through the corners, not really connected to the road. And that one had the Hi-Per Strut front suspension too. The new one is much more composed in corners, while still being compliant over bumps and imperfections on the road. We've only had the car a little over a month. But all is good so far!

buick,lacrosse,2019,John Watson, 06/27/2019,Most wonderful car!,5,"Buick LaCrosse is a very luxurious car with all comforts you would find in an expensive car. You feel pampered owning, driving, and experiencing this car. It is so sad that the trend is toward SUVs which will end the production of such beautiful and comfortable cars such as the LaCrosse. Old folks like us (65) like comfortable sedans. I have friends who are doing all they can to keep their Buick Park Avenues on the road because of the beauty, comfort, and drive. My 2019 Premium LaCrosse is  the replacement for them!

I had a 2013 Lacrosse and when I heard GM was discontinuing the Lacrosse I had to have the last of the series.  I went all out and got The Avenir; I am extatic  with the car.  The features are awesome.  The road visibility is improved over previous models.  The V6/310 hp engine is a big jump over the 2013 which had the V6/217 hp.  Couple that with 200 lbs lower curb weight and a 9 speed electronic transmission and the car is lively.  The adaptive suspension makes for outstanding comfort on any road surface.  The traditional quiet ride of the Buick makes it a solid luxury sedan.  The interior is spacious!  Plenty of room in the front or back seats and the trunk space is awesome.

buick,lacrosse,2019,GBustin, 01/15/2020,Excellent and comfortable car,5,"It is a pity that Buick is discontinuing the marketing of sedans in the US because the 2019 Lacrosse AWD is an extremely good car and at a very affordable price. It has many of the most current technological features, navigation system is good, voice recognition quality is excellent.  The 3.6 engine is capable of delivering all the power and acceleration one could want.  The Bose sound system is at a standard I would expect to find in only the highest end luxury cars.

buick,lacrosse,2019,LWH-Ohio, 04/19/2020,Best Car I've ever owned!,5,"I had a 2016 Lacrosse with all of the options. I thought it was the best I ever owned. When the salesman I bought it from called to see what I was going to do at the end of my lease I told him I was going to buy the 2016 out and keep it until the 2020's came out and buy a new one. He told me that wasn't going to happen since they were ending production in February of 2019. He found me an Avenir 2 weeks later and I can honestly say it is the fastest, best handling car I have ever owned. That includes Jags, Mercedes and BMW's. The 310HP V6 coupled with the 9 speed transmission slingshots the car up to speed. Heads up display and warning sensors keep you safe and secure. What Buick did from 2019 to 2019 was a winner. I wish we could have seen what the 2023 would have been like. Its a shame that its has come to an end.

buick,regal-sportback,2018,Jake, 05/18/2018,Most impressive car we have owned,5,"We have had this car for over almost 2 years now and there is very little not to like. In terms of value, it seems to beat the big name imported cars hands down. It has a responsive and peppy engine. The instrumentation is logical, though somewhat understated. Mileage on the highway has been much better than expected. We averaged over 30 mpg on a recent 500+ mile trip. Driving comfort is very good. We did have some mistaken potential crash warnings from the crash avoidance systems, especially when making sharp turns at an intersections where we turn into a lane that has a large truck stopped in the turn lane of the street that we are turning into. 
Wish lists:
The car had an automatic closing mechanism for its hatchback opening. 
The navigation system could be much more user friendly, like the systems offered by Tom-Tom for it's GPS units. GM should really update this as I think this could just need to be a softwaree update.
The memory system  for who the driver is for seat positioning, sometimes seems to relate to whoever entered the car first, not necessarily to the driver. This could use some tweaking. Likewise with the recognition of which phone it should pair with. Again these might also be a software tweak.

buick,regal-sportback,2018,Dave Schaller, 09/04/2018,GS must stand for Great Specs!,5,"Wanted a sporty fun 4-door since my grandkids' car seats wouldn't go in the back of my previous coupe.  The GS is a blast to drive.  At 6'2"" tall, I have trouble getting comfortable in many cars but the GS has the best seats of any car I've ever ridden in.  Heated, ventilated, multi-chamber lumbar, thigh extender, adjustable side bolster, and massaging features are topped off with a very wide range of positions forward/backwards/reclining.  The 4 door hatchback configuration allows the rear seats to fold flat with room to put a bicycle in back (try that with any other 4 door). The heads-up display not only shows the cruise set speed and current adaptive cruising speed it also can show: navigation directions, phone caller ID, radio station/song, and more.  The V6 uses regular fuel and the AWD system makes this a sure footed car that goes wherever you want it to go.  The lane keeping feature also keeps the car from going where you don't want it to go such as off the road or into another lane as it provides resistance into the steering wheel.  So far the 6 month wait for this car to arrive at the dealership has been worth it.  All that and about 30 MPG on the highway.  It has a few areas where GM got cheap like the sunglasses holder and sun visors, but I have had no quality issues with the vehicle.

buick,regal-sportback,2018,Photoman63, 11/27/2018,A car for those who think young,5,"Don't want or need an suv or truck. The Buick Regal GS is a great car for people who want something that you rarely{I really mean rarely} see on the road.  Even the other Regal models are scarce on the road. I haven't seen any model Regal let alone the GS.    The interior is sporty and up level. Leather back rubbing front seats keeps you comfortable.  The Infotainment center took time to understand everything it can do. But may favorite is the BOSE radio and speaker combined with SXM and you have a concert every time you drive the car.  The Regal GS comes standard with all wheel drive.  Our car is black on black. The black paint is metallic .  The car has that edgy look to it.  You can't go wrong with a GS or other Regal models. Drive one and you will see what I mean.

buick,regal-sportback,2018,510man, 04/05/2019,Over Engineered in the Wrong Places,3,"I own a 2018 Buick Sportback. Overall it's a nice vehicle. Two things that are total crap. 1) They spent WAY too much R&D on the door lock system. So computer geek designed the system and is likely the only one who knows how it works. I can lock and unlock my doors myself. I'm not sure why GM thought all this auto lock stuff is helpful. They need an option to turn all the auto lock off.......but there isn't one. 2) The car needs an Auto Stop override. The fact Buick doesn't give you a button to turn this off on demand like Ford and others do is unfortunate. AC shuts off and blows hot air, which is a problem in stop and go traffic. I can workaround it by shifting into neutral before stopping but that is a hassle to override the computer . I would not have purchased the car had I known I couldn't control these two features.

They had it 10 weeks when my father struck a deer. There was minor damage to the headlight and fender. The car has now been in the shop for 20 weeks (Since September 13). It is not the shop's fault. GM is not making replacement parts for their vehicles. We now have 4 different dealerships searching the country for the replacement part. It is the right front headlight. This should be a VERY common part. They have had to juggle their now 1 car for almost 6 months with both of them working. My mother cried last night. They JUST PURCHASED THE CAR. They have to make payments every month. but do not have the car. It has likely also depreciated $5,000 in value while sitting at the shop. If this is how GM Treats their customers then DO NOT BUY FROM THEM. BY the way Between my parents, siblings, and their souses they drive 12 GM vehicles most of which were purchased new.

Fuel consumption has averaged 6.1L per 100K per the readout, however I checked the last two fill ups and the car does actually use about 10% more fuel than indicated, however it is still excellent. The 4 cylinder engine provides effortless acceleration, especially on the highway. Seating is comfortable for long trips and anyone who has been in the car has commented on the smooth ride. The huge trunk is a big plus. Ride is quiet other than some tire noise on rough roads, I think that the newer Continental tires have foam inserts to minimize this. To my eyes the styling is very elegant. Overall this is probably the most enjoyable car I have owned.

buick,regal-sportback,2018,not wotrh the wait, 06/21/2018,not worth the wait,4,"car has potential for 4 or 5 stars. Software issue reported 3 months ago- still not corrected. Car took long enough time to be introduced. That time should  have eliminated flaws, especially since this problem is in other GM cars  that have been out for a full year. Also know engine requires premium fuel, other 4 cylinders do not. Back to the drawing board GM

The software problem finally fixed(6 months later), however mpg is not good nor is the fact that this engine requires premium gas, the Japanese  turbos use regular gas. Also, if you buy the fully equipped model, there is no spare tire- poor design flaw. Reliability is good.

I was told to bring the car back in. due to no techs available on Saturday. everything started working again. 1/6/2020 I took the car in bc AC started back doing the same thing running when off, SOS (onstar) was malfunctioning  emergency calls all day and night every 5-10 mins Head unit screen stays on service screen and couldnt be changed, the screens kept switching screens without being touched. Talked with service manager at dealership had to deactivate the onstar and take the car back when they received a loaner car. They cleaned button and said they ordered the part its on back order. 2/10/20 Im driving my vehicle and all of a sudden the car slows down and stops in the middle of the street in which the screen read reduced engine power.

We wanted a red GS, but as none were available, we settled on frost pearl white.

Within a day of bringing the car home, and under 500 miles on the car, I noticed a dramatic mismatch in the paint, on the rear 1/4 panel, as compared to the rear door and the rear bumper cover.   The 1/4 panel was whiter than both.  This was more noticeable in shade or under a cloudy sky where the refraction of the pearl wasn't as noted.  I immediately contacted the dealer to lodge a complaint.   Subsequently,  I took a long hard look at the rest of tbe paint quality.  I was extremely dissapointed in the quality control of the German factory from whence it came, as I circled 30 plus pieces of dirt in the clear coat.  Some so big that you can feel them sticking out of the paint.

The dealer suggested that I may get better results if I contacted GM directly,  so I filed an official complaint.  The young lady from GM was very nice and called back many times to see of my issues were resolved.  I explained my issues in detail and requested that a Buick Zone Rep meet me in person so that I may express my dissatisfaction and find a resolution.  The pearl paint was an option that cost over $1,000.00, and after 7,000 miles I'm still not happy.  I am reluctant to have them repaint the car, as it will detract from the long term value.  After all, a car is only new and original once.  I asked them to replace it, but no response.

Not long after 3,000 miles,  we had the first oil change.  On the way home I slid back the manual (ugh!) sunroof shade.  Much to my dismay, I hear a loud wind leak coming from the closed sunroof.  Once again I brought it back to the dealer, and they ordered a new glass as the weatherstrip is part of that assembly.  I can't believe that this is a fix, but I go along with the program.  At that point, the Zone Rep sees my car while in for the sunroof diagnosis and he sluffs off the paint as being ""commercially acceptable.""  This is a term that I'm well aware of as I worked in GM deaslerships for nearly 30 years as an ASE certified body and paint Master Technician.   ""Commercially Acceptable"" is a term that the factory uses as an excuse for poor workmanship and lack of quality control.  It's an age old excuse that doesn't hold water in todays competitive auto industry.

Finally now in July 2020 I meet in person with a Buick Zone Rep, and they tell me the sunroof glass is in from back order.

I don't know what the Zone Rep will do but I'm not optimistic. 

Now for a few pointers that Buick won't listen to because 2020 is the last year that they're selling sedans.

The following things are a disappointment in a car that costs $45K+.

1.  GM's lack of advertising has diminished the resale value dramatically.  How do they expect to sell cars if the public doesn't know they exist?  I recently saw an identical 2019 GS for sale under $30K. Too bad because this GS is actually a very good driving car!  They're giving up sedan sales to Kia, Hyundai, Honda, BMW, and any other company willing to advertise.

2.  The windshield sun visors suck!  They are fixed and won't slide back to block blinding sun streaming in the side door windows.  Even the Chinese made Envision and Korean made Encore that were loaners have sliding visors.

3.  The sunriof shade is manually operated (cheap).

4.  The auto recall front seat recalls the wrong driver setting, and controls are located below on the side of the seat and hard to use.  Front seat belt receivers are short, & hard too access. 

5.
  The sunroof and remote door closer overhead control consul is angeled forward,  causing you to duck down to see the buttons.

6.  The rear hatch is manual operation only, and no remote release in car.  You'd expect more from a car this expensive.

7.  It's made in Germany, not in the USA.   All of my LaCrosses were made in USA, and all had better quality control for the paint finish.  They were nearly perfect.

8.  The normally aspireated V6 is very good, but the GS should have been a step up such as supercharged or turbocharged V6.  

9.  Auto stop sucks!

What's Good:

1.  The 3.6 V6 has good response and torque. 

2.  The all wheel drive is balanced, with excellent handling & zero torque steer.

3.  The front bucket seats are fully adustable and somewhat comfortable but no way as comfy as Lacrosse. 

4.  Lots of cargo space.

5.  Superb braking due to Brembo up front.

6.  Adaptive cruise control, lane keep, auto braking, and object warning work perfectly.   It's the closest thing to selfdriving car, while you're still in control.

7.  The nine speed auto is perfect

8.  Fun 2 drive

buick,regal-sportback,2019,Dailydriver , 12/07/2019,Best Driving Car I’ve Owned,4,"I love the looks of my new Buick and it drives like a dream, however, it had a rough start. It came with a broken window regulator and an electrical glitch from the minute I bought it new. That was scary and disappointing, but the dealership fixed everything after several visits. 
Now that I have had it a year, I truly love it. It has gotten 42 MPG highway, and usually gets 27 in city. Amazing for this size of vehicle. The auto start stop can’t be disabled, but I grew to like it. I’m sad Buick has now discontinued this vehicle, but so glad I got one when I did. Can’t beat it for the price, tons of luxury features.

buick,regal-sportback,2019,Dale, 11/21/2019,Very roomy vehicle. Owned for 4 months.,5,"I love the Regal Sportback Preferred II.  Lots of room, power and comfort for our family of 4.  Only improvement could be a dimmer on the back up camera for night time visibility.  It creates an inability to use the mirrors with it's brightness. It is my first experience with it, so maybe I will get more used to it.

The special air freshener was under seat not sure if it fell out somewhere. It's supposed to never have to be replaced, but its lost its smell after 3 months. 🤔I can't find out how or where to it back.The Auto Stop is irritating at times.

Dollar for dollar the Buick Regal Sportback holds a class of its own.  With the 4 cylinder 2.0L turbocharged 9 speed automatic transmission fuel consumption is minimal , where as most SUV's can't compare even with the interior space too! I must admit I fell in love the moment I first drove it.

buick,regal-tourx,2018,John, 06/27/2018,New Regal Tour X,5,"Bought new regal awd, and so far very impressed .  Love the adaptive cruise control and spaciousness of the cargo available. What impresses me most so far, is I drive 50 miles a day, and the gas ,mileage is great. I've had the 2.0 turbo before so always loved its performance and handling  ability .  Have nothing but good things about this auto so far. When looking at suvs ,,,and how much they are compared to what I got for the money and add the gas mileage, will tell all very nice auto for the buck. Ps,,, Never thought would own a wagon, but this is not your grandfathers wagon either lol ."
buick,regal-tourx,2018,Rich, 12/29/2018,"Great, Flexible Wagon",5,"The Buick TourX drives like a car with good feel of the road, nice handling and adequate acceleration and power for most needs. It gets great mileage; on the highway with crossbars but without the cargo box, I routinely log 30-31 mpg. The safety features are impressive, and the rear camera and other parking assists ease any parking challenges. The back seat is very roomy, comfortable for two adults- adequate for 3 for short hops. The way back is very spacious and with the rear seats down, the TourX can haul provisions for a small army. I have made a number of long trips and altogether logged almost 9000 miles and am very happy with my decision. I formerly had an Acura TSX Sportwagon and had some trepidation about going to an American car, but aside from the interior finish- which is not as nice as the Acura- this Buick is a very worthy successor and in some respects- safety features, quiet ride and back seat and way back space- it clearly exceeds what the Acura offered. Like the Acura, the Buick lacks a real spare and instead has one of those useless inflator kits.

buick,regal-tourx,2018,Tom, 10/28/2018,Buick TourX is the perfect car for me.,5,"Maybe this car isn't for everyone, but if most people really consider how they use their vehicle, the TourX probably checks pretty much all of the boxes.  Looks great.  Well-powered.  So quiet and rides fantastic.  Interior is really nice if not luxurious, but I don't buy my cars to be over the top.  So much room.  Ground clearance?  Not great but seriously, few people really need the height of an Outback.  I love the Audi Allroad but won't pay the money for 1. the purchase and 2. the repairs.  To my eye this car looks much better and is nearly as good for much much less money.  I suspect most people who pass this car by do so for the same reason they purchase what they do:  emotion.  This is an amazing car that will always be a niche vehicle because people don't want the uncool wagon, they want the cool SUV.  I think that's nuts.  I guess it just means I'll have one of the few on the road.  If you're in the market, at least give it a try.  I absolutely love it.

buick,regal-tourx,2018,Scott Z., 01/30/2019,The TourX beats Audi and Subaru,5,"The TourX is exactly what I was looking for--a European-based AWD wagon; excellent value; great styling; strong engine; very good MPG; smooth transmission; big interior; quiet ride; excellent handling and lots of features. I have owned an Audi Allroad (unreliable); several Subarus (mundane and common) and two Lincoln SUVs (OK but still not as nice overall as the TourX).  The local Buick dealer was exemplary in terms of my purchase. Thus far I am very happy with my TourX. The only shortcomings I have found--and can live with nevertheless--are the lack of ventilated (cooled) seats, limited interior (front row) storage and the inability to turn off the 'automatic engine stop/start'.

buick,regal-tourx,2018,Kim, 01/13/2019,Wounder if this vehicle has been rushed to market,3,"We are leasing a new 2018 Buick Tour X, after taking delivery of the vehicle I was washing it. Noticed that the driver side mirror was the wrong color, and the backup grid was not staying on, and a piece of the trim on the rear quarter panel was loose (if we had gone to a car was it may have ripped it off). It took the dealership a month to get the new mirror in the right color. They were to check what was causing the backup grid problems,and fix the trim on the rear quarter pane. The mirror was fixed with the right color that matched the rest of the car,the trim was fixed but they did not what was causing the problem with the backup grid, GM tech told them to resit the radio to factory sittings and see if that would help, well it hasn't. After a short while we started have a very ear piercing squealing noise coming from under the hood, went back to the dealership again they had no idea what the noise was coming from, set up an appointment. Before we got to the appointment the vehicle started throwing several different codes and the car would not come out of park, all this the car was running. had to have the car towed to the dealership. It was a loose positive electrical cable going to the fuse block that had come loose, fixed. Still no fix for the backup grid they told us that GM tech was wright a patch to fix the problem, no time table but should have it done before Christmas. Back to the dealership again for a grinding noise coming from the front end under breaking, we were told that both of the lower control arms on these vehicles were bad and that they would need to be replaced. Waited another month for parts, oh by the way the patch for the problem with the backup grid never came. The dealership has told us that GM tech said it should have the patch for the backup grid by January no fix yet, now it is to be in February, we will see.

buick,regal-tourx,2018,Steve in KC, 03/11/2019,Surprise! This Cool Wagon Is A BUICK!,5,"I'd been driving my Acura RDX gas pig 12 years; while it was a great ownership experience (but for mpg) and I enjoyed not seeing them on every corner, it was time for a new ride. Considered Tesla 3, Volt, Niro and Leaf, but styling on all failed to move my pulse. Saw the pricing on the 2018 RDX and my eyes bugged out. I'm kind of over SUVs. And I just didn't want to spend $40k+ on a car. I'm big into outdoor pursuits (hiking, camping, taking wife + LARGE dogs along, and cycling) and for all that yep there's Subaru but I just find Subarus...uninspiring and everywhere. VW wagon? Meh. New Volvo wagons? Beautiful but ouch on pricing and upkeep. Enter the TourX. Here is something different, sleek and interesting with immense utility, low upkeep and very decent to good mpg (21/29 rated; real-world 22.9 city for me, 24 combined, 29+ highway). With the GM/dealer cash incentives, it became quickly evident that it'd be bonkers not to buy one. I'm pretty conservative when it comes to cars...I do a ton of research + a few long test drives. This was an easy decision. The hardest part initially was getting past the disconnect that TourX is a Buick. It's really an Opel made in Germany, but when you're used to Japanese quality and you lived through the excessive plasticlad GM '90s (and also blue-hairs being Buick's main target), you tend to have a disconnect when it comes to ""Cool Buick,"" ha.  //  I've had it for nearly 6 weeks now, much of that in repeated snow storms of several inches with flawless traction. Standard TourX AWD twin-clutch vectoring is unflappable. Engine warms up quickly to heat the car. Remote start and heated steering wheel are a godsend for bitterly cold, ice-encrusted days. LED headlights, awesome. The TourX value equation is incredible; I don't say that lightly. Bought top line but for moonroof...I can do without it in relentless 100º Kansas summers. My turbo 4 Acura was quick for an SUV with 0-60 in ~7 seconds but craptastic turbo lag. TourX does it in 6.5 — also with a turbo 4 but skip the lag. No I don't race but it's good to know there's plenty of go when you need to pass quickly on the highway, or for city maneuvers...I haven't tried the autostick yet, it's likely even quicker with that. Handling is good (found this out avoiding road hazard), steering is tight...clearly this wagon is German-engineered. At 3700 lbs, it's lighter than most CUVs. Safety packages are worth it. Interior is tasteful and comfortably lux without being gaudy. Wait 'til you see the interior at night, very cool. All controls are easy and logical with handy twist KNOBS for both audio volume and HVAC temp, thanks GM as this is not always the case (even my '07 Acura had succumbed to a maddening button sea for HVAC). GM touchscreen and voice commands are also easy with no fuss.  //  One caveat: the seat leather is not a top-grade hand vs. Acura/Volvo, but with TourX incentive pricing at $10k-25k (!) less when comparably equipped, it's VERY easy to forget that. I also suspect the TourX leather will be that much more durable over time, esp with dogs/kids (my Acura leather had a pup puncture). Seats are very comfortable with great lumbar support for both short and long trips. I'm 49 and holding (ha!), 6'1"", 185 lbs with 32"" inseam (long legs/waist) and no complaints on headroom either. And there is knee room leftover in back seat when I sit directly behind my driver's seat. Easily enough room for wife + her stuff, dogs + their stuff (or sub your kids!), + camping gear/luggage inside on a major mountain adventure without anything being sardined. PLUS there's primo real estate on floor behind front seats with rear seats down (and they lay FLAT, YESS!)  //  As an FYI: there's a TSB on the front lower control arms for the 2018 and (maybe?) 2019; bushings rub in moderate to heavy braking in temps below 40ºF. GM has addressed this with newly engineered
 parts that fix the issue. I'm good with this as GM owned it early and with zero baloney. Inconsequential. I took mine to dealer the other day. Parts are on order, it'll be fixed next week.  //  Low to ground means it handles great and easy entry/exit for ageing dogs. Cool. Ground clearance is close to 6"" which is fine to get to the trailhead for us. It's not a Jeep nor does it pretend to be a Subie. If you like a bit more refined + copious capability/utility, TourX is made for you. TourX ride is buttery smooth and amazingly quiet (no anemic CVT, thanks!); others in mine have commented on smooth/quiet as well – and unprompted. I've put about 1000 miles on my TourX including a 4-hour road trip. I'm still excited to take it out every time. GM has under-marketed it, so you don't see them and *nobody* knows what they are...but I don't mind that because I like hearing, ""Wow, that's a cool wagon, what is it?!"" That, and I have yet to spy more than one out in the wild in the past year. Go drive one and see for yourself. But shhh...don't tell too many people! Enjoy.

On the road we averaged 30 mpg and averaged 70 mph and the road comfort was great.  Minimum road noise and the GPS system guided us around unfavorable road conditions (wrecks ahead) saving a good amount of time and frustration.  We are now at 5400 miles after 10 week and enjoying the ride as much now as the first day.

buick,regal-tourx,2018,Jim S., 02/14/2019,It's a German-built vehicle,5,"Built by Opel and imported from Germany.  I rented a Vauxhall Insignia last summer in Edinburgh Scotland and loved the drive and feel.  Found out later that it's built in Germany by Opel and imported into the US under the Buick Regal badge.  The US version has noticeable upgrades from the UK and European version.  I was considering a Subaru Outback, but opted for the Buick due to it's larger cargo area.  I do wish it had an additional inch or two of ground clearance.

buick,regal-tourx,2018,Ed S, 12/31/2018,first week and 500 miles of ownership,5,"Excellent: handling, steering, brakes, ride comfort. Good mileage, smooth and quiet engine and transmission. The engine start stop is quiet and unobtrusive, unlike an Infiniti that I rented earlier this year. The optional LED headlights are great and really light up the road at night without being so bright that other drivers flash you. And the car was a screaming deal at $27,500 sale price VS. the $37,100 MSRP - especially with the standard 4 year bumper to bumper warranty. The optional blind spot alert and cross traffic alert work well.       The not so good, so far:  the option package upgraded stereo has a subwoofer where the spare tire would be, so there's no spare or jack at all, just a can of fix a flat and a compressor. The infotainment system randomly drops CarPlay in mid drive and requires you to unplug and re-plug your phone to reset it which is really annoying when it happens every 20 minutes during a road trip. Hopefully a software update will fix that. Also, for a $37,000 list price I would expect standard heated seats, which this car doen't have, even with $3k in options. Oh well. The $10,000 off list price goes a long way towards making up for that.

Where I was concerned about its power I'm no longer. The 4 cylinder turbo get the car going very quickly for its size. It doesn't linger but is swift.

I had never even heard of Vauxhall and was looking for information on this car here when I found it was the same basic car.   We drove all over the highlands, narrow winding roads at highway speeds, small towns, and some city driving.  This is one of the most comfortable cars I've ever driven.  It handles really well on windy roads.  The parking aides and sensors were really useful as this is a big car for a lot of UK spaces.  The passenger space is really roomy and comfortable.  The storage space is incredible.  I wouldn't buy it without test driving the US engine, but everything else is top notch. I've seen reviews try to compare it to Subaru wagons.  Its not an off road vehicle, it's a much nicer drive for anywhere else.

buick,regal-tourx,2018,swarfer, 09/11/2019,Not Your Neighbor's SUV,4,"No regrets purchasing  a 2018 TourX, a very practical, car like, drop dead gorgeous, rare vehicle that turns heads.

It really shines on the highway, getting 35 -37 mpg on premium, under favorable conditions, over 39 mpg. Aggressive, fast driving and regular gas and it drops significantly. Heavy stop and go is in the low 20s, light city is in the mid-20s.

During a violent swerving and breaking maneuver at 75mph when a semi pulled out while trying to pass him, the TourX remained in complete control probably saving our lives, certainly preventing an evil thrashing by the backend of the trailer. The AWD stability system and the low center of gravity made the difference.

Made in Germany and sold around the world under different guises, the US version uses the GM bullet proof 2.0 liter turbo four tuned to 240hp and an eight speed transmission similar to other models. Most importantly you can get it worked on at your local GM dealer. Astute owners will appreciate European design elements versus those found on Japanese vehicles. 

The negatives are narrow front seats, expensive without discounts, and mediocre interior materials/textures as most reviewers have identified. 

With all that glass, I put premium Llumar Pinnicle tint on the widows. Coupled with a superb air conditioner, you have to be careful not to get a head cold even on 100 degree days.

The dealer was upfront that finding someone who could appreciate the TourX was rare having only sold one before. With just a short easy session of give and take, I had very substantial discount without taking a hit on my trade.

buick,regal-tourx,2018,Tom, 01/31/2018,a short but revealing test drive,4,"I spent 15-20 minutes in this car with a salesman on board, so no hard driving involved.  Was impressed by the feel of the brakes and steering as well as the ride, which was not wallow-y at all.  However, I did not drive it hard so no conclusions there.  Low speed ride was solid, steering and brakes responsive and not over servoed.  Felt the engine was a little bit tepid for a car of this mass, I could see having to mat it frequently when picking up speed.  Also has the expected turbo lag down low from a stop but nothing too objectionable.  Quite roomy  inside, tons of cargo space.  Controls, during my short drive, seemed logical and easy to operate. Overall I would like to spend more time in it and drive it a little harder to see how it behaves.  One note, there was a small rattling noise over bumps, I suspect it was the sunroof but could not verify.

buick,regal-tourx,2018,Brian, 07/15/2019,2018 Buick Regal Tourx - Hidden Gem,5,"Traded in a 2015 GMC Acadia for this surprisingly nice wagon from Buick.   Was VERY surprised and impressed when I drove the car. Lots of room inside, engine has great pick up and is economical ( I am getting 28.3 MPG combined in the first 1500 miles).  Comfortable inside and feels very sporty.  Ground clearance is a little lower from what is usually desired in a car like this, but the stance makes it appear very sporty.  
The 2.0L 4cyl does a great job in acceleration and plenty of pickup, 8 spd transmission is nice for econ, but sometimes at slow speeds it shifts around a bit too much trying to find the right gear.  Infotainment touchscreen and Car Play are very nice and handy. 
Overall, loving the car.  I wish Buick would have advertised it a bit more as does slide into a nice space between those that want a Subaru Outback and those that want a sporty Audi Allroad or Volvo.  Definitely worth finding one and going for a drive in one!!

GM dealers cant address issues without GM TAC, car is in for its fourth Infotainment module as new ones keep coming up as Cadillac instead of GM.. Clearly TAC does not know what its doing.  Brought in Engineering....  Have to reprogram every time as there is no way top save settings... Certainly taken the Joy of owning a brand new GM product.  Should have stuck with FORD
4 days now at dealership 3 replacement infotainment module. Dealer no further ahead. TAC has handed it over to engineering. No fix in sight.
2 calls to Executive office with case number remain unanswered.

 ***Further to my previous review, Gm had the car in the dealership for 30 days trying to correct a problem with the camera grid lines the  Camera is installed and equipped with guide lines showing direction of travel and wheel position. These guidelines intermittently disappear for no apparent reason. If the car is put into neutral and then back into reverse lines reappear. Since the lines are a feature of the vehicle and are not working reliably I feel this is a defect, It is a definite distraction from the information that the camera is proffering. GM Acknowledged the problem initially and replaced a module 4 times on this vehicle in an attempt to correct the problem without success Now they have taken the position that the camera is working as designed... Clearly safety equipment should work reliably 100% of the time without distractions. In discussion with other GM owners and research online this problem is prevalent on other GM models across the product line. It appears to be be linked the number of safety features installed on the car. The more safety features the more likely of failures. This problem occurs on a daily basis and can be recreated at will. It will happen any time the car is traveling in reverse, In  addition the car developed a clunking noise from the from end when gently breaking, This required the control arms to be replaced. This was known problem on Buick Regals and subject to a TSB. Seems that GM only fix when there is a customer complaint. To me it seems that GM has given up on the domestic market. No wonder Hyundai and Kia are doing so well

04/28/19   Having owned and driven this car for 8 months now  time to give an update.
The car itself is very solid, drives very well and is a great ride, Hiway economy on 87 octane is surprises with over 40MPH being achieved at hiway speeds.  Not great around town but mostly exceeds the 21 advertised.. Have not tried a tank of HITEST 

Suffered through my first flat tire.  This is not good I learnt alot about AWD, no spare tire and using sealant goop in foam filled tires.   DONT do it unless you want to buy a new set of tires.  If possible inflate tire without goop and get to nearest tire dealer who may or may not know how to repair. the first one I went to refused to touch the conti-silent tires even tho he was a continental dealer. filling the foam filled tire with goop will render the tire un repairable.

Now back to the electronics To me its a bunch of systems cobbled together and rushed to market. Apart from grid lines a few other issues have been noticed. Like when I go in reverse sometimes the mirrors dip as designed   sometimes they dont.
Sometimes when in auto stop the DIC displays the words AUTO stop or shows a green circular arrow.. then sometimes it doesn't 

When cornering sharply a green circular serrated wheel appears in the bottom right of the DIC sometimes it doesn't. Its pretty much obscured by the spokes of the steering wheel  Since its green I have to assume its a good thing, however no one can tell me what it means . I think its to do with the
 AWD  rotating wheels at different speeds, However it would be nice to be documented 
Recently when programming the NAV an  incoming call interrupted me. After the call the NAV would not work complaining the map chip was bad.  Stopped the car and turned  everything off, restarted it but no luck.. after 2 hrs stop time it worked again.. I was told that i had to leave the car with the doors locked for at least ten minutes to give time for the systems to all shut down 

All in all I am happy with the car,  but very unhappy withe very expensive electronics.   GM have only ever told me its working as designed... That gives me a very warm feeling about GM only manufacturing ELECTRIC vehicles in the US,, how can they compete with TESLA.. Lets Hope they don't build an autonomous vehicle.

Latest update no new problems encountered. Vehicle is still a joy to drive.  As for the defects reported to GM executive.  They told me crap like the reverse camera is an option and as such is not required.  They have made absolutely no attempt to address the issues.  Just blow me off.

buick,regal-tourx,2018,GM has Lost Me, 11/22/2018,GM Reverts to 1980 Quality,2,"I fell in love with the Opel Tourx in Europe, this was my company car for a number of months.  The quality, performance and quietness were great. So I ordered one as soon as I saw that it would be available in the US.  Top of the line with every option, the car arrived and not 10 miles from the dealer a plate fell off from under nether the car, the backup camera fell out of its frame and the car was noisy.  Call the sales person and said we have a problem. When I got home i inspected the car very closely and saw that the door panels were lose, the tail gate sensor was hanging down the back seat would not lock in. Took it back to the dealer and they had the car for a week to correct the issues. I asked point blank if this car had been dropped off the truck or something, i was assured that it was not and if it had any damage if it was under $2500.00 it did not need to be disclosed. When I picked it up the car it was still very noisy inside the cab.  Took it back and said for them to check the noise canceling technology as my decidable meter on my phone was near 85-90. The Dealer and Buick customer service said that was a normal range. The dealer said if I wanted a quite car I should of bought a Cadillac or I could have the tires upgraded.  I do not even drive the car anymore it has 3300 miles on it and sits in the garage as it is not worth the hassle and is just not fun to drive. I ordered a new Lincoln that has a cabin noise level in the 40's and the Buick will be give to Charity and I will never buy another GM product.  If Mary Barra took delivery of a pair of heals that were this poor quality she would sue the company.  Our tax dollars bailed them out and this is what they did with the money.

The TourX has a smoother ride than the taller Envision SUV but since it is shorter you have lower yourself a little more to get in.  The mirrors are smaller but most everything is similar and we quickly got acquainted with the German wagon.  Fuel economy on the highway as we drove an hour from home was an amazing 40 mpg and rising at 60 mph until we got traffic and it stabilized at 39 mpg or so.

buick,regal-tourx,2019,Dave, 05/08/2019,"Sweet looking, but has a few issues",4,"First off, my largest compliant is: there is literally zero storage space for small personal items. If you have the sun roof, you also lose the sun glass holder. I guess the German cars are not for carrying small items that need to be stashed away (Keys, change, cell phones, employee badge, etc.

Second, the front end makes a lot of noise. Lots of crunching when you drive over uneven pavement especially at lower speeds and if braking when the weight transfers forward. Just annoying.

Third, when you start it cold, it really sounds like it is struggling to provide power until it warms up. The first 1 mile just feels painful to the little engine that wants too.

Other than those items - I love it. It looks awesome, turns heads, ride nice, handles well, gets good gas mileage, has enough power and is fun to drive. The AWD works great in the winter as well.

Some reviewers complain of the start/stop feature. Easy to override, put in manual 'tiptronic' mode at stop lights. Heck, it is more fun. My wife did not want the Nanny features so it does not have pkg 2. I have to agree with her, much more fun to drive the car without it yelling at me every two minutes that I am doing something wrong.
Yes, cupholders could use a redesign but have figured out to use low commuter cups to get to temp control. Android auto is great. And the power. 2.0 t eco tech GM engine is assume, yes you may have to do some work and shift it manually but that is what driving is about. Ride is amazing, had an issue with a clunking sound first 100 miles, dealer put in a new shock absorber, that was the issue. Did I say this is an Opel?

buick,regal-tourx,2019,Wagon Fan, 05/10/2019,Great SUV/Crossover alternative,5,"Draws more attention than a Volvo V90 wagon, for $25k less. Just as capable, and when optioned correctly, just as full featured and luxurious. Materials in the interior may be a slight step down, but overall a great value. Quiet, composed ride with more than enough power. Unless you plan to off road often, this vehicle's AWD works great. And you won't see yourself coming and going either. Dealers are willing to discount these right now too.  

One year in and this vehicle still impresses.  A couple of small issues like the infotainment system pre-sets not always working, the reverse camera guide lines disappearing during back-up, and still waiting for a replacement for damaged passenger side mirror, but mechanically it has been great, 34 MPG on a couple road trips.  Would recommend if anyone is considering the TourX, get one now as GM will not sell them after this year, pity.

Zero issues with the car. Looks great, runs great. Never had a car where so many people stop and ask what it is and say how much they like it.  It is shame Buick didn’t make an effort to sell these. 



Original:
Great car.  High gas mileage.  Tons of cargo space.  Comfortable ride.  Nice interior.  Super winter performance - we live in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.  Plenty of power.  Apple CarPlay.  Don't need a step ladder to wash it or load something on the carrier.  

We get approached every week by someone who sees it in a parking lot and says: 'Wow - that is a great looking car' and 'I had no idea Buick made a car like that'.  We have a bright red 2019 with Essence Trim.  6000 miles on it - ZERO issues.  Crazy that Buick has given up on these.

buick,regal-tourx,2019,Mike from Jersey, 10/22/2019,DO NOT BUY A TOURX-MAYBE,2,"Did not have much time to see if this car was worth the money.  Had an accident and found out GM has orphaned the vehicle.  The parts needed to put the car back on the road are not available since GM has not developed the parts supply and are not willing to do a separate run.  (Headlight and side view mirror.)  Car can not legally be driven so I'm stuck with paying hundreds in a car payment without driving it or ruining my credit by letting it be repossessed.  SHAME ON YOU GM.
UPDATE: Buick finally came up with the parts and my repaired Buick was returned to me in mid-Dec, 5 months after bringing it to the body shop.  Still have not been driving it much due to COVID-19 crisis issues.  Seems like a nice car but I reserve judgment until I have an opportunity to operate it regularly for a while. At the moment, dislikes include that it does not run well on regular gas. They should be more overt with the ""runs better on high-octane fuel"" warning vs hiding it in small print in the owners manual.  Likes include performance when I DO use high-octane fuel.
UPDATE Oct 2020: Went on 2 long trips (3000 mi round trip) and planning a 3rd. Gas mileage not great and premium fuel is pricey, but performance and comfort were good. Solid storage capacity for 2 persons with 10 day's of luggage each. Had another problem with parts availability when a side window was broken and took 2 weeks to get a replacement though part of that was Safelite's fault. Electronics are good but too many re-boots requiring stop, turn off, turn car back on. Can be frustrating if traveling.

buick,regal-tourx,2019,Polymehanos, 06/17/2020,Very good wagon,5,"Last December I bought my 2019 Regal TourX, fully loaded and after 7K miles I still like my purchase and feel that I made the right choice. My car received over 10K in discounts which definitely helped me reach my decision. Apart from the pricing, the car I feel is good, well built and with many positives. After my purchase, GM announced dropping the TourX which for me is a head scratcher because a) It is a vg all around wagon/vehicle, and b) others seem to like it as I get complements on the car's looks.
In summary, the positives: It looks super nice, it drives smooth with enough power and outstanding road manners, excellent ergonomics(seating, access, rear seat, space, comfort, buttons), near excellent infotainment and technology (the adaptive cruise control and heated steering are must have!, the LCD screen is big enough, the software above average and the response is quick) and good MPG (~30 hwy and ~22 city).
The negatives are few and I know I am being picky: The lane assist although good could have been better(when using I find myself dealing with a bit of lane to lane correction, maybe it is on me?), the interior is using the GM hard plastics(what is GM thinking? Come on GM this is a 40K car! Get on any VW/Hyundai/Honda vehicle and can tell the difference), the seats (although fine with good comfort) are wrapped in cheap quality leather and could use a bit more padding, to access the oil filter requires removing the engine's lower dust cover.

On reaching my decision, I was in the market for a wagon with a budget 35-45K. So I drove the Volvo v90, (impressive and expensive, over 55K!), almost bought the Subaru Outback (I liked it, was not sold on the big screen-too bright @night- and I thought the near 40K thought it was too much for a wagon, which at times was looking a bit like a ""tool"", wanted a bit of luxury too, like the Volvo). The TourX was always in the back of my mind and kept asking why not the Buick?When comparing equipment, performance against the Subaru, the Buick TourX, for my needs, was coming close enough (my off road needs are...minimal, needed a wagon for the space and 4wheel drive it was a nice to have) and as mentioned about 10K less.

So bought the Buick TourX, it is my first US vehicle (and it is made is Germany! go figure) however after 7K miles all is good, enjoying it and if you are for a wagon...take a look.

buick,century,2000,thagentleman22, 10/03/2011,2000 Buick Century,4,"PROS:
-A cheap luxury car. Gets you from point A to B.
-Smooth ride, good MPG. Low maintenance car.
-Comfortable, roomy seating. Bang for your $.

CONS:
-Can take a while to get up to faster speeds.
-Battery went out after 1 month. Windows went out also. Both minor problems, though.
-Rims are ugly (Not a problem with the car). 

I bought this Buick in August for $5,000 from an elderly man in the desert, Palm Springs, California area. This car has close to 95,000 miles on it. Overall, it has been good to me, and after I get a new battery, I should be a happy owner for another 5 years. Very happy, so far."
buick,century,2000,Andy, 06/23/2018,"A comfortable, reliable, boring, rusting car",4,"This car is pretty old, but if you need a really cheap car that is reliable it could be a good choice. Visually it isn't the worst looking 18 year old car. Reliability has been great since we got the car from my grandpa. He had to do some transmission work and I'm sure the intake manifold gaskets at one point, but I believe that after that it's pretty much going to run forever, maybe not with the best health as rubber hoses are going to get brittle and break on an 18 year old car, but it should still take you places without too much trouble. It's not really a car you have to worry about too much since parts aren't expensive. Mine has 185,000 miles. The driving experience is pretty boring but adequate for getting you around. It has a lot of body roll and doesn't feel particularly secure doing fast turns, or is in other words floaty. The steering is decently responsive though. Acceleration is adequate, which means it won't wow you but should be enough to get up to speed on the highway. The car is a little hard to park, because the edges are all rounded and it makes the position of the car a little uncertain. Windows are plentiful and mirrors are large which makes visibility good. Build quality wise the car isn't the best. I know it's old, but the mirrors have fallen off and have had to be glued, the speakers are blown (although it's 18, years old so we'll cut it some slack), but there is random wear and tear that has occurred that shouldn't, like the radio knob is missing, piece of cupholder broken, loose looking components that look like they barely fit all over the place, broken glovebox, passenger side window switch doesn't work, button broken on window switch, foam disintegrating. The door panels literally move when the windows roll down. But that is okay if your main focus is reliability and a car that just drives you around. The only big build quality problem is rust. If you are living in the south it may not be an issue, but in the north the bottom of a door has begun to rust after 3 years here. Whether critical components like rocker panels are affected is uncertain, but I've noticed a few Centuries with rusted out rocker panels. Interior wise it is roomy, but you are missing features like rear cupholders. It is neat how center console folds up for a 6th seat. It has a lot of door storage. No rear vents though or fold down seats. Climate control is basic but easy to use, and has Dual zone control. One thing to watch out for is these old cars probably don't have a working heater and the A/C might not work well. My heater doesn't work for a long time, and the A/C which has been recharged is ice cold only when the car is moving. Technology is not great because it doesn't have a CD player. Comfort is good. The seats are not uncomfortable but not the most supportive or contoured. The soft suspension is awesome on our pothole roads though. Basically, if you are looking for a reliable, roomy car that gets decent gas mileage, you dont care about bad interior build quality, and you are looking for one that doesn't have any complicated electronics to break, this car is a good option! Just check for rust and when you get the car maybe do some preventative stuff like washing your car during the winter/getting an undercoating. I don't have any long winter experience with this southern car so I can't give a first hand experience. I have just seen a few rusty ones.

Update: one of the back window stopped working. Window regulators are a known weak point on this car I believe.

However, I have been relatively pleased with the car. It is a superb cruising car, and is comfortable in the city. The 3100 V6 is powerful enough, but the transmission seems to sap power from the engine when accelerating from a standstill. It responds to spirited cornering with tons of body roll and pathetic squeals from the 15 inch tires. However, it has been a reliable car that doesn't attract any unwanted attention. Would I buy one?

Interestingly, the replacement kit has worked twice as long as the original transmission. If not for the window problem, I have had a pretty good exoerience with the car."

"
buick,century,2000,Casey Goodwin, 02/22/2019,Too little too late,4,"(My particular Century was purchased new in 2001 by my grandmother, who gifted it to me several months ago. It has over $2,000 in options including automatic heated side mirrors and an 8 speaker sound system with amplifier.) The Buick Century was GM's answer to a younger generation buying V6 Honda Accord and Toyota Corolla's. Buick used the old century name to try and rope in the younger crowd with interior colors matching the exterior, high fidelity audio, a powerful V6 engine coupled with a fast responding electronic transmission. Unfortunately, GM missed the mark by sticking with parts from other models in the GM family line up. The buttons are all oversized, the window and mirror controls are from the Chevy Malibu, the rearview mirror is from the Chevy Suburban, ect. The rear seats don't allow access to the trunk, which limits how you can utilize the storage space. Steering is surprisingly tight for a Buick and the wheel doesnt take very many turns to reach lock. The brake pedal is perfectly linear and gives you confidance in braking, while allowing you to control much brake pressure is applied better than any other sedan I've ever driven. The 4 speed 4T65E automatic that's shared with every FWD transaxle GM car from 1998 to roughly 2012 was supposed to be ahead of its time, however in the end it's a transmission too concerned with fuel economy on the highway and not enough with anything else. It searches for gears during city and traffic drives, it jumps when shifting out of a neutral gear, and worst of all the torque converter clutch that's supposed to be a technological breakthrough causes the transmission to get stuck in torque converter lock up, making gear changes harsh and fast. The engine makes more low end torque than you'll know what to do with and purrs in any and all conditions, while requiring light maintenance by today's standards. The largest issue with the 3.1l 60 degree v6 is weak lower intake manifold gaskets that require the removal of the push rods. If it weren't for the weak link of a transmission, the 2000 Buick Century would have hit closer to its mark and been a solid performer all around and appealed to a younger crowd. If you like Buick and think my review is spot on, check out the new Buick Regal GS. It's my next car for when I 6MT swap my Century.

The transmission was serviced for a TSB regarding hard shifting/shuddering gears.  The transmission still has problems with harsh shifts and chugging motions at times, even interstate speeds; somewhat disconcerting. This car has developed a lot of creaks and rattles.

buick,century,2000,andy, 06/17/2020,Reliable engine; transmission problems,3,"We purchased this car from our grandpa in 2014. He probably took good care of it. In 2020, it has 195,000 miles. For the fairly short time we've driven the car, ~20k miles, it has been a  fairly good car. 

I hope our experience can help somebody considering buying the Century, but I recommend talking to a good mechanic about their thoughts and asking them to inspect the car before buying it.

Its engine has been good all things considered. The engine is slow and never ran perfectly due to the car's age, but the car always started and never leaks oil. We change the oil in time. The big maintenance item was EGR valve that cost $300, which helped it run a lot better. A thermostat change to fix the heat was cheap. A/C stopped working over time after a repair.

MPG is good too, I calculated 19.7 mpg from driving up/down a mountain to school.

The interior is cheaply made. Some windows don't work, the speakers blew, and the hi-beam switch is hard to activate since it's broken. The gear select/miles LCD screen go dim sometimes and I must spam the trip odometer button to get it back.

The transmission seems to be a weak point. My grandpa had to do a band-aid repair a while back, and since 2019 it is has been slipping out of overdrive on some days. It causes the car to feel sluggish and shifting through gears cause the car to shake. It also makes a whirring noise when it acts up. My mechanic said his transmission repair buddy sees it a lot with these cars, and the only fix is an expensive rebuild. I asked and he says it is still driveable, but without the overdrive gear, my MPG might not be as good.

We had to do some repairs on suspension. I remember that it was tie rod and sway bar, which was $400-$500. The car is due for brakes July 2020. 

The rear right door is rusting underneath and I see some slight rust on the rocker panel near the door. The car was originally from the south but has been in NE since 2014, so it sees road salt. Please ask a mechanic about their thoughts on these cars rusting. I'm not a professional, but I have seen these cars with rusted out rocker panels.

Overall this car does take us places, so it's been a good car in that sense. But it's 20 years old and has problems from age. Transmission problems are common with this model, so be careful about that. Rust could be a concern and the interior build quality isn't good. The crash test rating from IIHS is only ""acceptable"".

I would still call it a good car since it's been faithful in taking us places, and I appreciate that it has the anti-lock brakes. We're not sure if it is reliable enough for everyday driving."
buick,century,2001,friddlebillrules@yahoo.com, 09/28/2015,Great Average car,5,"Bought mine for $1200 off a private seller. It needed and alignment and tires. It also had the ABS and ""Trac Off"" light on. I bought it with 165,000 miles on it and had a mechanic look over it and do some pressure tests.  Only complaint i really have with this car is there is no rpm gauge on the cluster. kind of a pain but i can live with that. The car is extremely comfortable. I have a slightly bad back and driving for long periods of time doesn't mess with my back at all. The electronic seat adjustment helps out a lot too. The dash has a nice setup. Nothing is complicated and its easier to fix that a lot of newer cars. The engine is pretty nice. It holds up well with basic maintenance. With the higher mileage I have on mine I've never had to do anything with it. Previous owner did have to replace the intake manifold gasket, but that's a known problem with the Century. Has the perfect amount of acceleration. It not ridiculously fast but its not slow. Its got some pick up if you need it. You don't need to race in a Century. Once i got the alignment and tire fixed the car rode like it was brand new.  Heck, it drove nicer than my brand new Kia Soul did. The car doesn't look flashy, but I still think it looks alright beside the rocker rust that come free with every Century. :-) If you find one for a good deal and you like it get it.

It turns out I liked it so much, I use it as my commuter car for work. Gas mileage is excellent (26 mpg local and 30 mpg highway) and the V6 has plenty of power. What a surprise coming from a chunky Buick. Oh, and the comfort is worth it alone. The ride is very soft, so don't worry about fatigue, just be careful of the sharp curves. At 100K I replaced both axles, tie rods, one brg and did the usual 100k maintenance. There was some coolant loss, most likely due to GM's problem with the V6's, but one can of stop leak did the trick. Overall it's a great car if you don't mind the cigar jokes."

The car is very comfortable, has a nice sound system, is very solid, (no rattles), and awesome gas mileage. I average 25 city, and my best highway is 32 mpg! My only complaint is that it is equipped with OnStar that is no longer available. I wish GM would have come up with a solution for some kind of adapter so I could still have the security.  It has adequate power for my needs. If you want more, look into the Buick Regal in the same years as this model was produced. Would recommend this car to anyone."

buick,century,2001,youonpointtip, 09/29/2019,"Solid, no-nonsense midsize sedan!",4,"The 2001 Buick Century was a hand-me-down from my grandmother when I was in high school. It had around 70k miles on it and was in great shape until I went to college and its frame rotted away in my parents' driveway. Being a moody teenage boy I definitely was NOT its most responsible owner, but it still worked pretty well throughout most of my time with it! These 3100 V6's have an earned reputation for reliability. However, the biggest issue was that there was coolant leaking into the intake manifold at one point. This apparently is a chronic issue for these cars per my research (aka a google search). Also, the gas gauge would sometimes fluctuate back and forth during the first few minutes of a drive. 

Otherwise, the seats were incredibly comfortable, as was the very soft suspension. By no means is this Buick a fast car; but merging was no problem with plenty of power, solid visibility, and a predictable four-speed auto. It's got clumsy handling but it's almost charming at times, if not entertaining on backroads. Also, this car has a very nice turning radius for easy parking. If you're in the market for a cheap, reliable midsize sedan, such as the Accord or Camry, give the Buick Century some thought. You probably won't be disappointed.

For the time I had this vehicle, it did what it needed to do until 100k miles. I probably replaced my intake gaskets 3x on this car in 5 years. Buick used a cheap plastic part instead of metal. This caused a lot of issues. My buick overheated quite often due to these issues as well. It was finally laid to rest when the engine started smoking like crazy after driving it. To be fair, i paid $4k for this car and got 8 years out of it. I also put easily $6k into repairing the thing. 

Aside from mechanical issues and the fact that it's usually driven by grandmas, it was relatively comfortable. Considering it was a 2001, the sound system was ok, (concert theater II). it did alright in the South Dakota winters as long as the tires were good and you didn't drive like a teenager. 

Reasonable passenger/cargo space.

buick,century,2001,DozerCSX, 07/05/2020,Terrific Transportation Appliance,5,"My Dad gave me his 2001 Buick Century Limited SE as he didn't really drive much any more, so I have been discovering the Zen of the ""Gateway To Luxury"" (the marketing phase for this entry level Buick). Seriously, it's not so much a car as a terrific transportation appliance - it gets great gas mileage for a mid-size, super quiet, super comfortable (they should patent those seats in the 60/40 split bench!) Excellent 8 speaker stereo, great outward visibility. The Limited SE means full leather seating, cruise control, auto dimming rear view mirror and more - it's like a mini-Regal without the supercharged engine and premium gas! And this thing has a ginormous trunk! I have put 5 golf bags in there. And no maintenance issues so far (my dad did pretty meticulous maintenance, but did have to fix the transaxle at 90k) The Zen is: DON'T RUSH and you don't really have a choice. The car rides brilliantly so long as you DON'T RUSH. Rush through a corner and you'll end up on someone's front lawn. But nobody does, which is why the insurance rates are hilariously low. I like it, two thumbs up.

buick,century,2002,Bob, 10/09/2015,Love It,5,"I have had it for 12 years and have put about 100,000 on it. As far as reliability, the car has failed to start only one time-when the original battery gave out after six years. It has never been in a shop for repairs. A few things have gone wrong such as power windows, a blower resistor, led resistor in gauge cluster, and a/c clutch coil. I fixed all those things myself. The cost and level of difficulty were low, though. I have done all of the regular maintenance such as oils, filters, brake pads,coolant, tune up, -again cheap and easy. This year (2015), the car was showing some signs of wear, and since it ran and drove quite well still, I decided to do a semi restoration. I repaired the rusted rocker panels. New tires, brakes, struts, motor/tranny mounts, tires, headlights,exhaust system, wheel bearings, paint touch up, a few other piddly things. It runs and drives like brand new no issues at all. In 12 years time I have spent under 4000 on maintenance and 2500 of it was on the semi restoration this year. It has spent most of it's life outside, but the paint still looks very good. It has been a great car for 12 years and it will most definitely last another 12. Good solid reliable car.

Car is now old. 160K miles, rocker panel rust, and things are starting to break. The gas guage has some kind of electrical problem. Hubby and mechanic said it's not worth fixing. It's time to replace the car. I still get 25-27 mpg. That is impossible to match in a car with this kind of comfort and quiet. I wish they still made this model.

The car was comfortable to drive and to sit in, and it was heavy so wind was never an issue. At college, multiple people backed into the car and slammed into me at red lights (go figure), but the car hardly sustained damage. It accelerated like a dream, and it was great on gas considering its size. The only complaint I had was that its maneuverability was not fantastic, but these cars are literally tanks so that's to be expected. The day I got rid of it, I bawled. I've never felt so attached to a car, but this model kept me safe and made driving to any destination stress free. If you're considering buying a Century, definitely do!

It's great in the snow with Tractional Control and FWD. The AC is still ice cold and has never needed to be recharged. I replaced the original battery before last winter even though it still started the car fine (I changed it at 7yrs/100K because I didn't want it to fail on a cold day). Except for routine maintenence the only work I've done was a replacement intake manifold gasket and bolts. I did this as a precaution (not because I was losing coolant) because the 3.1 is known for eventually leaking. I still get great mpg. This car will do another 100-150K easily.

This car gets better mileage than the Volvo and I know it won't be in the shop every four months.  I like the ride and have no problems with the handling.  I guess it's what you're used to. I also have a '91 Reatta and have owned 2 other Buicks.
buick,century,2002,Noah Wheeler, 08/14/2018,A Stable Car for Anyone,5,"I owned my Buick for nearly 7 years. Mechanically and functionality it was perfect. I gave 3 stars for exterior because it rusted out. The most common problems for all Centuries is the rocker panels under the doors. Once they rust out, they need replacing. I had some issues with the underbody as well such as the break lines. Hey, but living in New England will do this to a car. Overall, this car is a solid buy. There’s a reason they are popular, they get the job done...point A to Point B."

I hit a deer head on going 45 mph and it didn't even leave a scratch! I was also involved in a head on collision (that wasn't my fault) going 25 mph... still NOTHING! cant say the same for the other driver! Best $800 i've ever spent!

buick,century,2002,pbm, 12/05/2008,5 years later,4,It's been over 5 years (and about 75K) since I last rated this car and I'm still very happy with it. I now have 101K and she's running strong. Except for maintenance items the only things needed were new struts at 80K (driving in NYC can be tough). I also replaced the lower intake manifold gasket at 80K as a precaution (an $800 job) because the 3.1 is known to leak coolant into the oil eventually. I just replaced the original battery at 100K because I didn't want to chance getting stuck this winter. This car feels like 300K is doable. Mileage is still averaging about 25 mpg with over 30 on long trips. It has never let me down. A/C is still ice cold without ever being recharged.

I drove it for 3 hours once and didn't need to stretch when I got out!  Over the last year and a half, only 3 inexpensive parts have failed, the throttle position sensor, the blower motor, and one wheel bearing.

I am very disappointed that general motors stopped making this car in 2005. I now have my eyes set on purchasing a Buick Lacrosse which I hope proves to be as good of a car as the Buick Century. Overall the Century offers premium luxury at an affordable price. I would buy a Buick over a Lexus or Mercedes any day."
buick,century,2003,Screwed by GM, 12/14/2006,Great car up till now,3,"This is my 3rd Buick I've owned. Always liked the comfortable ride and good gas mileage (33 mpg on highway), and ample room. However at 82,000 miles the car developed an antifreeze leak. Took to local Buick delearship and they had to replace lower intake gaskets (8 hr job) and water pump. Total cost over $1100. After searching the web, found other GM car owners with same problems, and most common culprit was the Dexcool antifreeze now used by GM and plastic gaskets that get eaten away by the Dexcool. No wonder Toyota and Honda are selling so many cars. It's called quality and reliability!  "

Driving the ""B"" as my wife calls it, has been a pleasant surprise. Dad had put only 33,000 miles on it, maintained it by the book. I use it as a commuter car, primarily suburban to city driving, lot's of traffic lights, little highway. MPG is great, 22-23 city, 33 highway, on a 600 mile round trip. Comfortable after getting acclimated to a ""rolling sofa."" Plenty of trunk space, easy to service by local mechanic. I would not have even looked at this car, let alone bought one, as I feel it is designed for the more senior driver. Still, I now have a low mileage ride which competes with our 2 VW's in MPG! "

The ride is pure Buick, no other car rides like these do.  We have had no problems with them mechanically.  Unfortunately, we will not be buying another one unless Buick goes back to the quality that was once their trademark.  Gone is the leather trim, replaced with cheap plastics.

I recommend these three ""upgrades"":

1. Pour a can of transmission Seafoam in the automatic transmission by pouring it down the tube of the check stick.

2. Replace the air filter with a K&N or home made from cut reusable air conditioning filter material. MPG will improve 10%.

I was truly surprised, The comfort, quiet and ride quality both in town and on the highway is unlike anything I've experienced. The biggest surprise is the gas millage, I 've experienced near 28 MPG in town and over 34 on the highway. This is better than the Accords 4 cylinder. The depreciation was double that of the Honda and subsequently over half the cost for the same year vehicle.

The leather interior, dual automatic temperature controls, and chrome wheels are great and generally found only in more expensive automobiles. Never a reliability problem. Mileage runs 23- 25 city and 30-32 highway. May not do quite that well with an ethanol mix, but still close. "
buick,century,2005,Jack Hawk, 10/02/2018,Century is Impressive,5,"I have owned several Buicks since my days as a Buick parts manager in New Jersey in the mid-80s, and honestly have had a long love affair with the brand---my all-time favourite car is the 1959 Buick Electra, and I recall Buick as the car used on the TV show Highway Patrol in the 50s. I have owned many cars in my life, but few have given me the total enjoyment I got from my Buicks. When I was younger, I had a Somerset Regal, and in the late 80s I had a LeSabre. When I bought a Century, I was impressed at the power and economy it returned. Here was a V6 that behaved like an 8 cylinder but gave me 30 MPG. The velour=like seats were like relaxing at home on your couch. Driving position and all-around visibility were great. Unfortunately, an enemy firebombed that car and I moved on to another GM vehicle, then a Honda. As I'm getting older, getting in and out of the Honda got hard, so I looked into something bigger and much to my surprise, I got the opportunity to get a Century newer than my last one. It was love at first sight as I had easy access, comfortable bench seats with arm rests front and rear, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, power windows, mirrors, and door locks plus dual-zone adjustable A/C. The great sound system featured some new things for me as well---several bands to choose from, including weather and traffic, a CD player, and a readout that tells the song and artist now playing. This is no ""barn burner"", but after having a 4 cyl Honda Civic, it's satisfying to step on the gas and have this 3.1 litre V6 GO with authority. Best of all, my Century averages 30 MPG---impressive since my Civic got about 35 with a smaller engine and body. I'm very impressed, and feel like I'm driving a luxury car now/ Some added safety features door locks that actuate as you put the car in drive, headlights that turn on by themselves at dusk, remote door and trunk locks with a remote trunk opener in the glove box and key fob, and lights that stay on for about 45 seconds after you park your car and lock your doors at night. In short, this is a car that fills all my needs.
Today, a year later, I finally put enough miles on it for the ""change engine oil soon"" light to come on. Since it took conventional oil, that was a relatively cheap service at our local Valvoline Instant Oil Change location. I still love cruising down the highway while listening to the great factory stereo that features song and artist info of the station that's tuned in. An added bonus is it still averages 26-28 MPG highway on regular unleaded......
Today (October 4, 2019), it's still giving me a pleasant driving experience, and have not had any expenses other than gas, insurance, and oil changes. It continues to be an affordable, reliable automobile that drives as well as it looks.
"
buick,century,2005,David Cowan, 01/18/2006,Better than my LaCrosse,5,"I also have a LaCrosse and the Century has a smoother ride and more comfortable seats, plus much better gas mileage in the city. Do not listen to the auto experts that believe a harsh ride, stiff seats and a run through the cones is what the real world of driving is. I have 9,000 on the Century and test drove both Camry and Accord prior to purchase, both rode stiffer and were not as powerful. Plus the quality with the Buick is just as good. The six is fine and getting on ramps and passing is no problem."
buick,century,2005,John Eagle, 04/01/2010,toyota to buick,5,"I've owned Geo metros, Toyota corollas, and other cars. The 2005 Century I bought shocked me with 36 mpg on a 1000 mile trip. My 1999 corollas only got 38 max. I was so impressed that I bought another used Century (1999). Why buy small cars when the comfort/power/reliability of a Century gets near same mpg? My 16 yr old son didn't want me to get a ""grandpa car"", but he sure loves it now that it's his! Dependable, reliable, affordable but I was careful in my research and examination of used Centurys. I walked away from some ""bargains"" because I found rust carefully concealed or the engine/ride didn't sound/feel right. I'm going to buy one more soon!"

I also feel that North Americans are not supporting our country and fellow citizens (workers of General Motors) by not buying from the original car makers of our country. Performance is all that I could want or expect.  I drive the highways quite a lot and when I need the power and pick up to pass on a two lane highway it is always there. Buick is the car for this all-Canadian gal!  So far, it has been all that was promised."

And, and probably  the last affordable Buicks. Makes a great, comfortable 4 passenger car with great power, fuel millage for a full-size-I average around 24 in-town and close to 30 on road. Highly recommended.
Now a couple of years later and this 2005 Buck Century is just as great. Higher quality new tires helped even more!  I can't find a better pre-owned late model that's better yet!
"
buick,century,2005,Tara, 05/18/2018,Best low repair/maintenance I've ever experienced,5,"The only concern that I had with this car was the blind spot seemed more than other cars that I've driven and owned during my 56 years. Other than this, the car truly was the lowest maintenance/repair cost of any vehicle I've driven or owned to date, and I've own a few cars during my day. I give it an A++ for reliability and get up and go. I'm also a person of 5'2"" and the seats were great, my back did not sit off the back of the seat as it does in most cars because the seat is usually longer than my hip to knee area which causes my back to not sit flush with the back of the seat; this can cause great discomfort and lower back pain. I had no such problem with this car while all of my taller friends never complained once about being uncomfortable so that is a win/win for tall and short drivers and passengers!! This quality is a big one in my book. No complaints and lots of compliments go to the 2005 Buick Century! Really a great car, great A/C and great stereo as well, the other big factors as far as my likes are concerned.
"
buick,century,2005,140Vair, 12/19/2019,Thrilled with our Purchase of a 21 Yr. Old Century,5,"We needed an inexpensive ""second"" car for a daily commuter that we could pay cash for. We found a 1999 Buick Century Limited with only 76,500 miles on it. The low mileage is what sold me the most initially. Averaging around 25k miles a year on a vehicle, I figured there should be 3 years of life left in it until I retire. At first, I joked with everyone that it was my Senior-Mobile. However, after my first 200 miles with it, I have a whole new respect for this underrated vehicle! This car runs and drives very smoothly. No wonder why seniors bought a bunch of these cars. It's comfortable, roomy, smooth and pretty easy on gas for a larger vehicle. It's not a hot rod, but that's okay. I didn't purchase this vehicle to impress anyone with looks & performance. I experience a combined city/freeway mileage of 24 MPG. For daily commuting, that impresses me more than feeding extra ponies all the time. With 3 months and 6000 miles under my belt with this Century, we may be considering a newer Buick in the future.

drive to Yellowstone from Saltlake 
city, but they ran out and gave me this 
Buick to my big innitial 
disappointment. I wanted a small gas 
efficient car for my trip. My best 
friend got a Ford Focus at the same 
time. Well, we took out the cars and 
hit the road at night, inside the Buick 
looked almost exactly like my Dad's 
old 1984 Cutlas Supreme. The 
ride was cushy, very quiet and the car 
felt somewhat underpowered. We drove 
150 miles, and the next morning we 
pulled up to a gas station. To my utter 
surprise, the Century needed 2 dollars 
less than the Focus to refill the tank. "

specifically do not like the lights-
on/lights-off games, however.  I am not 
senile.  I want to turn the headlights 
on when I want them on, and off when I 
want them off.  I want the interior 
lights on if and only if I open a door, 
or if I turn them on.  At least, let 
these features be programmable."

close to 30 miles per gallon. I now 
have averaged 34 MPG with my V6 Buick 
and am extremely happy every time I 
pull into a Gas Station. The ride is 
very comfortable and the Buick handles 
extremely well. There is very little 
road or wind noise and it gets off the 
mark very well. The dual heat/air 
control is very much appreciated and 
posi-traction is helpful in slippery 
conditions. Leg room in front and back 
is much better than I have been used 
to. "
buick,century,2005,George Smith, 07/10/2004,Thoughts on Century,3,"   Car is too light, and suspension 
system is poor, resulting in 
disappointing riding quality.  The tires
must be poor quality, because when 
taking curves on a road which is 
slightly crowned, the car feels as 
though it is about to roll over; instead
of tires, perhaps design has poor weight
distribution.  It is necessary to slow
down significantly to feel safe, and I
don't mean slowing down from 70 to 55,
but rather from 45 to 30 for example."

The only, and I mean only problem with this car is the power window motors. The two rear ones are burned up. Locked them in the up position. Other than that, nothing has been replaced, nothing at all. Just replaced the battery for the first time at 205k (as far as I know). That's it, most reliable car and engine I've ever known."
buick,lesabre,2000,Andi, 11/29/2017,Great for poor students,5,"I am a second year college student and have owned my 2000 Buick Lesabre for over a year now, getting it when it had a little less than 123K miles and I now have over 130K miles on it. Even though everyone tells me it is an old person car, I love my Buick. I have driven it over 600 miles one way to college (with a trip back to home and then back to college in-between) and I haven't seen many problems. Recently, my mass air flow sensor went out and it started driving horribly, but I bought the piece for $150 and it took me less than two minutes to replace it and now it drives great. I love how smooth of a ride it is and how comfortable the ride is. I also love having the bench seat up front in-case I need to drive five other people somewhere. My few complaints about the car include the broken fuel level sensor (I've gotten accustomed to just keeping track of how many miles I have driven and just fill up every 300 miles), both rear window regulators went out (I was able to buy the parts for about $150 each and replaced them myself), and the front passenger control arm was rusted out pretty bad (I had this replaced by an auto repair shop). The fabric on the roof of the car is starting to fall, but I just put adhesive on it and called it good. It is a hunky car, which I am not a fan of, and it does not turn well at all (I end up having to do Y-turns or multiple turns). I love the trunk space, especially to haul everything to and from college. Overall, I love the car, I got it for pretty cheap at $1300 (great for being on a college budget and having no help in paying for a car) and it has done its job of getting me to different places and it is pretty reliable.

**Update: Unfortunately, I had to scrap my Buick about two months ago (June 2018). When I brought it in to my mechanic to see if it would make a long road trip, they noticed a 12 inch hole in my structure near my front driver's side wheel. Because of this, my mechanic said that it was a very unsafe car to drive much further than local driving. However, this isn't because the car was not built right, it's because I live where it snows and ices very often, causing the car to rust from salt and snow. I still loved that car and was extremely sad to let it go.

buick,lesabre,2000,cranecreek, 02/20/2002,Better than the 1999,4,"Much better than the previous design, a pleasure to drive. 30 mpg is real. Problems are the center console and early strut problems. The dash rattles like the older la sabres,but all in all at 40,000 miles its been a great car."
buick,lesabre,2000,smgbjl, 09/21/2009,Great but watch window assembly,3,"I bought my Buick new in 2000, it has been great for long trips as well as city driving. Having owned it now for 9 years the only problem I've encountered is the power window regulators which make the windows go up and down. I had to replace all 4 of them. They run about $400.00 installed. Thank God I sell cars for a living so I got a discount on labor and parts. Other than that one problem the car has been great!"
buick,lesabre,2000,Jason Waddoups, 04/12/2016,Great car. Very solid,5,"This has been a great car.  Purchased at 135k previous care unknown.  Currently at 245k, runs and drives great.  22/32 which is great for its size.  Rebuilt transmissioin at 180k, starter, vacuum hose leak, battery, tires, gas guage was out when purchased.  Use trip counter for fillups.   Dual climate system on passenger side would randomly stop working, then start back up again.  No repairs done.  Center console flip broken hinge.  Of the 3 keys, two of the chips went bad and the car stopped recognizing them.

It has been a very solid car.  Always starts, never left us stranded.  The engine is strong and shifts smoothly.  If is fantastic in snow and ice.  Went through snow covered mountain passes every winter without problem.  Does better than friends Outback and MDX.  The ride is smooth and only the biggest potholes are felt.

I have never been in a car that rolls as well as this one does.  When I take my foot off the gas, you can't tell.  The car keeps rolling without the noticeable slowing experience in other cars.  At 80mph, on a flat road, it takes about 30 seconds for the car to slow to 70.  It is like there is no resistance.  It gains speed on any and all downhills.

I never thought I would enjoy driving a Buick. It is now one of the top companies for customer service and reliability.  Brother has a 2006 Rendezvous that is about to hit 250k and has been very reliable.  Maybe I'll try the Enclave next.

Nice features and good ride/handling. Plenty pep. Also had a spark coil and motor mount failure at about 50K miles. But car looks great (still) and runs great.

This car is a horse.  Cons, service engine light comes on and it usually is a air senson gone bad, which is minor repairs.  People need to understand that when you buy a Buick, it is meant to be driven smoothly. This car is not to be driven like a Grand Prix or Monte Carlo.

buick,lesabre,2000,Debbie, 08/04/2010,Power windows,2,Do not ever ever think of buying this car.  Power windows were cheaply made and they will all stop working.  Cost is $400-500 to repair each window and that does not guarantee it will not happen again.  Only fix is to permanently lock windows so they can never be used but how safe or logical is that? Apparently Buick does not care - never issued a recall because there is/was no safety issue.  DO NOT BUY THIS CAR!
buick,lesabre,2000,Phylis, 06/07/2010,Most expensive car I've owned,3,"My 2000 Le Sabre has cost us more to repair than all our other vehicles combined over their lifetime.  We bought it as a program car with 13,000 miles in 2003. Both front axles and a motor mount were replaced 3 years ago. Last year, it was a leaky fuel line, which only comes in the complete line that extends to the center of the vehicle.  With 107,000 miles on the car, two tie rod ends, two struts and mounts, the motor mount and the transmission mount had to be replaced.  It is back in the shop, today, for the 3rd motor mount replacement because the most recent one broke again.  One back door lock does not work, and the motor in the front passenger side window has been replaced."

on the bumper to bumper, I had the 
drivers lumbar replaced (it was broke), 
and a new radio because the color wore 
off the buttons (and it's done it on 
the new one too). I have had it almost

Entire front end rebuild, $1.2k, 6 window regulators, $2.4K each at street value, engine computer, $400, hydraulic engine mount, $300, UCV joint, $400, all new wheels needed, $600. Rusting is unbelievable. Car rattles peretually during acceleration, shakes horribly at high speeds. Feels like a 30 year old car. Dash is completely separating and folding up in front of windshield. Numerous other repairs. Interior plastic parts falling off. Of 3 Buicks owned, each one literally fell apart (rust, bumper, trans)"

The front wheel drive with traction lock is amazing in the snow. Living in the mountains of Colorado this is a must. The car has 193,000 miles. Yes we had to put a new transmission in at 170000 miles but it was worth it."
buick,lesabre,2000,Richard, 03/09/2016,Thank god we only inherited it!,2,"We were given a 2000 buick lesabre back in 2008 by a family member that was no longer driving. It wasnt our number 1 choice but since it was free, we took it. It had about 50k miles on it back then. Now we're on 8 with about 105k mIles and this car is an absolute dog! Every interior piece that can wear out or break, has! The soft, dash top has started to lift up, on it's own! Then there's loose interior parts with huge gaps, acres of hard, hollow, cheap plastics, only two horribly designed  cup holders for the entire car which are broken by the way! The two cup holders are put so close together that you can't fit anything bigger than two water bottles there. If you've got a bug gulp, you're screwed! You'll have to keep it between your legs and risk spilling it all over the car. The back seat passengers have no where to put a cup. But there's ashtrays in the back seat? That ""wood"" trim you see is actually hard plastic! The climate selector switch broke once. That's another cheap plastic part. Every window regulator has either failed or been replaced.  The front drivers side has been replaced twice. The front passenger has been replaced once. But now (the window is stuck partially open) and the rear windows have gotten stuck a few times but have been fortunate enough to get them up. There is no permanent fix for this. The power front drivers seat works when it wants to. The seats are not supportive at all. The fuel level sensor dosent work and hasn't for years. I can't even tell how much gas is in the car. That's a $1000 fix. No way we're paying that for a car that's probably not even worth that. I thought that a car that's supposed to be an upper scale entry level ""luxury"" car that, the interior pieces and features wouldn't be so flimsy. But it is an American car through and through (bad quality). A Chevrolet Avalanche and Jeep Wrangler we had all had bad interior quality. The rear, air suspension has never worked right, still dosent work right and is costly to fix. Overall I have to say, the engine and transmission hasn't given us much trouble yet but that interior and feature quality is pathetic. No more american.

four windows have failed/broken at least
twice and some three times. We have
reached a point of being afraid of
lowering any window for fear it won't
raise. The most recent failure happened
last week to my wife. She decided to try
lowering the rear left window since the
inside of the car was so hot from the
desert sun. Bad move. Down once and it
wouldn't raise. The little flip of the

I can't believe this car still consistently delivers such solid performance at about 22 - 24 MPG. In the last year, I had to replace the two front axles at about 230K, the lower control arms at about 240K, and the master electrical control, but what can you expect with this kind of mileage? She still turns over every day, looks great, and the interior, except for the cheap door skin pins, has held up well.

The drivers seat does not have a single scratch or tare on it. The previous owner took extremely good care of this vehicle and preformed regular maintenance religiously. It just goes to show if you respect your vehicle and really take good care of it the. It can last more then 20 years and look like it just came out of the factory. I paid $2,000 and have spent about $150 more flushing the dex-cool so now the coolant looks brand new. It took me about a week using the hose and adding cleaner/ flush to the system. I can not stress the importance of having clean coolant. The crud that builds up after 20 years will destroy the engine, even with regular coolant changes. After some new plugs and wires the vehicle is ready to last another 20 years. It is better to do preventative maintenance then to do repairs. What a jewel this car is.

The reason being is because so many things have been done to it to keep it running, and in decent shape.  Those of you who own one are familiar with the LeSabre problems.  I have replaced the upper and lower intake manifold gaskets,  upper plenum, valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, transmission pan gasket, the window motors and regulators,  fuel filler pipe, front lower control arms, CV axles,  inner tie rods and tie rod ends, struts and shocks, water pump, fuel pump, alternator, radiator, AC compressor.  and a host of minor things to numerous to mention. Hood pistons, sensors, brakes and rotors front and rear, tire's,  so many things.    All in all it's in perfect shape, but only because of all that's been done to it.  You can imagine the cost of keeping this beast running if you had to take it to a garage for the work.  I do my own wrenching and all the part's are from EBAY, except tires.   That's a huge saving believe me.  Much more than several thousand dollars.  If you can't do this work it's probably not worth keeping the vehicle.  It's probably no better than any other vehicle it competes with and may even have more problems than some of them do.  You hear about how great the 3800 engine is, but consider everything that has to be replaced around it, and on it,  to keep the car on the road.  That said I think I'll squeeze some more miles out of it, and replace more things as needed.

Total costs for these repairs was under 1K.
This is in addition to regular maintenance.
I can say unequivocally that this is the best buy in a car that I have ever purchased.
I gave 5K for it and today the car yields 23 mpg back and forth to work and 28 to 30 on trips.

buick,lesabre,2001,librarian, 08/22/2010,Never Again,3,"Bought this well-maintained car used with low mileage. We had good luck with Camrys but wanted to go US. Nice ride, comfortable with lots of power. That's about the only good thing I can think of to say. We can't use any light switches as they've all broken - keep them set to run automatically and hope we don't need to change a setting-both buttons broke off. The gas gauge doesn't work. Over last two years, all four window motors have broken, the two in the back are wedged closed to save the $400 (EACH) to repair them. Whey do we need to open those windows? The fan motor broke in the hottest summer ever, saving to get that fixed. Our 1999 Camry has needed gas and oil since we got it in 2005."
buick,lesabre,2001,ib, 04/04/2002,2001 Buick LeSabre Limited Scares,2,"I began to have steering problems about 
1500 miles into my ownership of this 
auto.  At highway speeds it would 
suddenly feel like I was hydro-planing 
or hit a patch of ice.  It felt as if 
the back end wanted to go one way and 
the front end another and turning the 
steering wheel had no effect for a 
couple of seconds.  They have re-
aligned the tires and found one that 
was defective and replaced that one.  
This problem began after I made a hard 
stop, but not an emergency stop, and 
the ""Traction off"" light came on.  No 
matter what I tried (even turning off 
the motor), I could not get that light 
to go off. They found a problem with a 
wire and the brakes.  It still does not 
drive right."

It had 81K on it. This was a one owner car that was well taken care of. The Carfax was spotless and the car was  dealer serviced. I have had great performance from the Buicks I have owned and this one is a peach! I am an outside salesman so reliability and comfort are a big deal. So far, So Good!  Has all the options I love for long trips, and after adding satellite radio I'm very happy. The ride is a little stiff at times but a minor issue.

After driving the car for 4 months 3 of the 4 power window regulators failed. I doubt they were even used more than 50 times. The power steering chatters on hard turns. The dash electronics constantly go out. The radio/disc player constantly goes on and off. The brakes are all chattering and grabbing. Had to replace all 4 tires after 16,000 miles. General tires are the worst. Put new Goodyear Assurance tires on and it made all the difference in the world! Buick is no help at all regarding repairs.

I've also been very happy with mine.  The only complaint I have is that the ABS light comes on, and I was told the whole component in the wheel hub needs to be replaced at my Buick dealership.  It cost about $517.00.  I don't feel that this should have gone so soon, since that light went on a week after I got the car.  I think that they need to improve their ABS system since my mom's car has had the same problem from the time it was new and hers is a earlier model.

was surprised by this considering GM is 
notorious for their squeaky interiors, 
and cheap plastic parts. The 
transmission shifts smoothly, and 
engine has tons of torque. The only 
thing I do not like over previous

Handles very well in the snow and is a lot of fun to drive, especially on the highway. The engine is powerful, accelerates quick, and is very reliable, yet fuel efficient.

buick,lesabre,2002,Jay, 04/30/2017,Still In Love With My Buick,5,"While I have never had a complaint with any General Motors vehicle owned by me in the past, without doubt my 2002 Buick LeSabre has been the most reliable automobile ever owned by me.  I purchased it in February 2014 for $5,000 with approximately 86,000 miles on the odometer; and I now have approximately 223,000 miles showing on the odometer.  In 27,000 miles this vehicle will exceed the ""Quarter Million Mile"" threshold.  In January 2018 I needed to install a Jasper re-built transmission (181,000 miles on the odometer), but the engine runs as strong as ever without any need for overhaul.  I change the engine oil/filter and rotate the tires every 3,000 miles.  I change the spark plugs and wires very 100,000 miles.  I use Valvoline's standard (10W-30) oil which is considerably less expensive than synthetic oil now required in modern vehicles; the engine has a cast iron block thereby alleviating need for the plastic ""under motor protection"" panel; and according to my records (which I religiously maintain) the four General Tires which were installed back in October 2014 now have approximately 120,000 miles use!  I use regular grade ""Top Tier"" fuel and average 22 mpg.  The acceleration is most acceptable; and while my wife's previous Volkswagen Jetta TDI and current Honda CR-V have better handling, I cannot say that the Buick's ability to tackle curves is any way unacceptable.  Most importantly, the exterior of the car remains unblemished and without rust; the interior leather seats have not cracked or faded; and the dashboard controls and gauges remain easily visible and accessible.  It is a proven work horse, and I can only hope (and reasonably expect) Buick is continuing the same quality in its current production models.  I will not soon know, of course, since I have no plans to sell my 17 year old sedan.

Now my rear passenger side door will not lock or unlock (except manually) and the window will not operate. I was told it was a module that would cost around $400 to replace. I am not fixing it; I am selling the car. This well maintained car with only 66,000 miles probably has a lot of good wear left, but it is costing me money parked in my driveway most of the time. I am not going to risk spending $1,000 per door. Anyone hears of a class action, I am in!!"

Well, I'm here to tell you that this Buick far exceeds anything Toyota, Nissan, Honda or Mitsubishi has. I've owned 'em all. The Buick gets good gas mileage, it's very quiet inside, and handles very well. I love it! The engine is powerful and quiet also.  Front seat accomodates a rather large driver very comfortably. I'm 6'2"", 225lbs. and I fit in the car with ease. What more can I say? This is simply one of the best all around cars that I've ever owned. Rent one for a few days and drive it or test drive one. Once you drive it you'll buy it. No more Toyotas for me. Two thumbs up for the good ole USA & God Bless America!"

No one has been able to give us an explanation as to why this occurs. The car is garaged and no children to slam doors. The fuel economy is excellent but the money we save go into replacing window motors.

In the first 20,000 miles the following parts needed replacement: plenum gasket,right drive bearing, and left drive bearing. All were expensive fixes costing $250-$500. 
Sensors wore out frequently on the motor. The MAP sensor and fuel regulator sensors were the last to go.
While it rode nice, this car was poorly built and I won't buy another Buick Lesabre.
I suggest reading the Edmunds reliability section before considering buying this model or any with the Series II 3.8L V-6.

That will be my last buick I buy."
buick,lesabre,2002,JC, 12/27/2016,Shockingly poor reliability,2,"I wish I'd had the experiences I'm reading about on here. I owned two Buick Lesabres prior to my 2002 Limited-- a 1993 Custom with 223,000 miles and a 1999 Limited with 200,000 miles at trade-in. Only standard maintenance was necessary with each, never a single major repair, so I expected the same results with my new Lesabre. Basically, I got to 133,000 miles, but not before spending thousands upon thousands in repairs. I bought the car new, so everything was fine while under warranty, but soon thereafter the nightmare began. The first to go were the brakes on all four wheels around 40,000 miles. These were about $500. The next to go was the hard shifting transmission which lasted about 80,000 miles. This cost around $1500.  Somewhere between 80,000 and 100,000 miles I had a the greatest number of problems, mostly electrical, but some other issues too. Exterior lighting/wiring went bad with turn signals and tail lamps. This was about a $400 fix. Lights started burning out on the climate control buttons, then the radio and steering wheel buttons. This couldn't be fixed at all short of replacing head units and switches and it would've been so costly I decided to just forgo it. Brake lines rusted out (and don't ask me how since I live in California)--$500 more. Leaking fuel injectors, poor performance and hard starting, $800 more. The blower fan  stopped working--$200 more. The dash began to peel around the opening for the window defroster. I never bothered to replace. The passenger door panel started coming loose and I didn't bother with that either. Gas cap needed replacing because there was a vacuum leak. That was $90 more. The final straw was at 103,000 miles when the engine had an internal backfire in the intake manifold. The engine essentially imploded causing the plastic intake plenum to shatter, the heads to leak and the oil cap to bust off of the filler neck. If I hadn't been on a long trip and stranded in the middle of Wyoming, I'd have bought another car; instead, I had to repair at $3400. By the time I got to 133,000 the suspension was weak, the car rattled and shimmied, needed more engine work and the AC overhauled and I couldn't take anymore. Surprisingly, I didn't have the problem with window regulators like everyone else mentioned. On another note, this model of Lesabre, while having the same dimensions on paper, seemed smaller on the inside and larger on the outside than my two previous models--more trunk and good, less overall interior room--not a good move if you ask me. Road trips were not comfortable for backseat passengers and the front wasn't much better. It also seemed more plastic and cheap overall and the ride quality not as soft or cushy. The value was great and resale value excellent, but I think the 36,000 mile warranty was skimpy. I left Buick for a number of years and came back with a 2011 Lacrosse that now has 131,000 miles and runs like a Swiss watch with no repairs at all. THAT is what I expect from a Buick and my 2002 Lesabre just didn't deliver. Maybe mine was a lemon?

Expect to pay around $800 to get this fixed at least once every 12-15k miles.  Other than this problem the brakes will need serviced annually if you drive primarily in the city. This is due to heaviness of vehicle and constant stop and go driving under these conditions. Great fuel economy on highway. I've gotten as high as 32mpg on vacation trips in this car at 70mph. Amazing. In the city forget. Avg is 18mpg.
buick,lesabre,2002,Budster McMitchell, 08/19/2010,Window mechanism = hidden warranty,4,"2 of my window regulators went bad while still under warranty. The last one was not covered, $750.00 with labor. I read where lots of others with 2002 LeSabre had same problems with crap window regulators. This is obviously a hidden warranty, should be recalled, but it wasn't. For sure i will not buy another GM product for rest of my life. It is comfortable for my frame at 6'4"" and 300 lbs and has never left me stranded, but the window regulators is a future deal killer as far as GM goes. I'm hoping my 4th window doesn't go as well..Another $750.00 ? The faux wood panels in the dash are horrific too."

I replaced the right front myself, to the tune of $375.00 for the part only. Then the right rear failed, it is being held in the up position with a piece of wood jammed under the regulator arm. All 4 have failed for the same reason. They are running a metal cable over a plastic pulley wheel and using a plastic spool on the motor. When the plastic pulley wheel breaks the cable misalignes on the spool and the window wont go up. Any Idiot that designed this should be fired.

Bought a top of the line Celebration edition with gran touring package and every other option for $7500, with 44,000 miles.
The tires and brakes are original.
The only thing that does not work is the seat warmer on the drivers side.
I am 6' and the seats are too short and too cushy.
The upper manifold leak had already been fixed by the previous owner.
I get 27 mpg country driving (55 mph, little stopping) and 21 or 22 in the city.
A good value, huge trunk, the car heats up quick, defrosts quicker, is smooth riding and kinda floaty. "

An '86 LeSabre we tried to wear out and couldn't, and a '95 Regal that was still going strong at 180,000 when we sold it.  The 2003 replaced the Regal in 11/05. It had 34k, was in excellent condition, and bought from the proverbial ""old lady"". It is a comfortable, quiet road car. My wife drives it about 13k hwy mi/yr and pampers it. Trouble began in 1/07 at about 60k mi. Had to replace lft rear window regulator, then the rt one 4 mos later, then the lft one again 30 days later. 4/09 both dr latch/sensor assblys on rt side.

buick,lesabre,2003,Wayne, 01/18/2018,"Buick's never die, they just grow older",4,"I purchased this vehicle after Mother Nature totaled my prized 1999 Buick Regal with a supercharged 3.8 L engine. It only had 369,000 miles on it - barely broken in. It had some minor rear damage, some dings, a tear and an excessive wear spot in the leather on the driver seat, and a few other minor things, but hey, I was buying a used car. It didn't have the power of my Regal, of course, but it was no slouch either. All-in-all I was happy. I paid cash for an ""AS IS"" car but they chose to give me a 90-day warranty because they ""liked"" me and I paid cash. Two weeks later I brought it in with a few problems. The dealer charged me an outrages sum of money and would guarantee it would fix my problem - it didn't fix my problems and my 90-day warranty was a hoax. I no longer use that dealer - found an honest one up north. I have discovered that the previous owners did not take very good care of their car. I have always lived by the premise that if you take care of your car, it will take care of you. I'm down to fair-wear and-tear items now. The engine has never skipped a beat! The 3.8 has been a solid workhorse since 1961. It's a real shame they stopped making it. As for the rest of the car, once I fixed a problem, it stayed fixed!!! I expect to get at least 350,000 miles out of this Buick now that she's happy again. I have NEVER been disappointed with my Buicks!

buick,lesabre,2003,Bob Miller, 08/31/2018,"Buying ""THAT"" car",5,"We have owned older LeSabres and always found them to be great cars.  My wife wanted a newer LeSabre so I informed her that they ended in 2005.  She told me to be on the lookout for a nice one.  I was checking Craig's list when a new listing popped up that was hard to believe.  Son selling his dad's car for his widowed mother.  Bought new in Sept. '03 and a 4"" stack of receipts of all service since.  74k miles with new servicing and tires for the sale.  Needless to say, my wife is very happy with car, it's comfort and economy.  Seats 5 adults and a child with adequate space, or 6 adults in a pinch.  The head and leg room are more than adequate for people over 6' to ride in comfort.  Handles well for a larger car and rides like a limo.  Car has never had dirty oil and never will the way I maintain it.  At 63 I expect to have this car for life or until totalled.

Heater takes too long & I'm at my destination before the car is comfortably warm... 15-20 minutes on a 28 degree day.  The car has just turned 43,000 miles and the A/C went out.  Mechanic called today and has to replace the condenser @ $426.00, due to a leak.   Suburban driving gas mpg is lousy even for a big car 15-16 mpg. Great expressway mpg, 30-33 mpg.

buick,lesabre,2003,Bob, 06/17/2010,Some dissapointment,3,Bought it used. Great gas mileage as an average for its weight. Nice ride. Loaded with options. Great red color and chrome wheels. This will be the second time I have to replace the motor mounts. I now have 96000 miles on it. My 97 buick had the motor mounts replaced three times. I had to replaced the frozen rear gas shocks. Recently had both wheel axle seals replace was leaking grease. Just recently had both front axles replaced. Its again in the shop for motor mounts. Oh yes the seat heater does not work. Blower motor is going out. Just ordered another one. Other than that I do like the car but may not buy a buick again. GM toughen up the motor mounts i can handle less smoothness.

When I purchased this 2003 I ask the salesman if GM had fixed the problem with the intake manifolds warping and leaking. He said they did. He lied. I just had to replace the intake manifold on this 2003. You would think that since this problem has been around for so long GM would have fixed it in production.

On the way home from our cottage, my radio and air conditioner just cut out by themselves. (I was able to turn them back on.) My dashboard lights dim. My two-tone leather seat split at a seam (very rarely to I have anyone in back). I'm so upset with the car I'm trading it in for a Toyota.

trouble cooling the car in an 85-degree 
day. The legroom for this 6'4"" person 
is pathetic for a big car. There is no 
height adjustment on the seatbelts, 
making them ride too close to my wife's 
neck causing discomfort(this is 
downright embarrassing, Buick). I still 
have to slam the trunk for it to close 
just like in my father's Buick of 25 
years ago(which I hated even then when 
I was too young to drive). The sound

control. But it's still comfortable. Everything is located great and 
features are easily understood and used like the memory seats and 
mirrors. It's already hitting 29 mpg cruising and it's only a few hundred 
miles old. The brakes are perfect in their feel. I am anxious to try out 
the self-stabilizing feature.

with the car loaded, and it would 
bottom out.  The handling of the 2003 
is very positive.  The suspension, 
although not stiff, gives the driver a 
feeling of being ""in tune"" with the car.
All controls are very well located, 
easy to see, and easy to access.  The

Two months after the time warranty expired (3 years but the car had only 29000 miles) I needed a new transmission switch.  While fixing the transmission, the mechanic found an air conditioning problem (over $1000) then while repairing the air conditioning found an intake manifold seal problem (over $1000).  The catch for partial ""goodwill"" warranty coverage was allowing them to perform the expensive 30000 mile service. It still cost me over $1000 and the transmission still shifed rough.

buick,lesabre,2004,Chris, 09/04/2015,best car I ever owned.,5,"Second owner, bought this car in 2009 with 55000 miles. Vehicle is extremely comfortable to ride in and loaded with a ton of great features. My favorite features were the seats, heated and adjustable enough to accommodate a driver with very long legs and a short torso, a problem I've had in all other vehicles was getting comfortable on a long drive. Front bench seating is easier to keep clean than a center console. Interior features were well ahead of its time and comparable to expensive luxury vehicles of the same age. Even with rust and being beaten half to death by being stored outside in one of the worst northern climates in the states and not cared for very well, the paint hasn't faded or lost its gloss she still turns heads with classic styling and a blue soft top. Car handled better through some really nasty winters with cheap all weathers than my old Jeep with snow tires. Vehicle was a steal at $12000. I got my money out of her, and I'm very sad to see her go. Car needs significant work any vehicle would after going through what she's been through, but the vehicle is still solid beyond my expectations and capable of another 60000 miles at least.

This is a great low maintenance vehicle perfect for a family, and would be a good choice for a winter rat. Gas mileage isn't great, but decent for a full size sedan. My only complaints is that the gear shifts are kind of laggy, sometimes it'll hard shift. GM's 3.8 is a tried and true engine, but the four speed transmission makes for a boring ride. Car handles well and is easy to maneuver but the suspension feels a little rough on highways. Dash lights, passenger climate control, and one of the heated seats burnt out. The only repairs I had in seven years besides standard maintenance and rust related repairs were a blower motor going ($200 with a used motor), an ignition problem (estimated $75), an EVAP leak that has engine light on, and a small coolant leak ($180).

Not the greatest pick-up but with everything else, it's a fantastic car, from the very spacious interior and trunk, technology, fuel usage, safety features, and overall performance. I'd recommend this car to anyone (especially first-time drivers as the ride is very secure).
"
buick,lesabre,2004,rahni, 06/12/2004,Major engine problems,3,"LeSabre's 2000-2004 are made with a 
phenolic resin intake maniford that 
warps and leaks antifreeze into the 
engine's cylinders - basically blowing 
superheated steam into the combustion 
chambers. The factory-recall fix (put 
locktight on 3 bolts) doesn't work. 
According to a factory trained 
mechanic, many engines have had to be 
replaced because of this cheap 
construction. Also, ""permanently 
lubricated"" tie-rods wear prematurely 
and have to be replaced at low milage.
Plastic window grips on electric 
windows break easily."

buick,lesabre,2004,hcrobie, 02/27/2013,JUNK,2,"I bought a lesabre a few years ago, it was used so I didn't expect it to be in perfect condition but it was in pretty good condition none the less. After driving it for only a couple of months the transmission started acting up so I took it in. The transmission had to be replaced and they actually had to install it twice because the first one was ""defective"". Two years later and only 50,000 miles later I had to have the transmission replaced again. It seems as though the transmissions they chose to install in this model are just expensive junk. Other little things have been breaking down since then, ball joints, blower motor for the heat ect. "

We had rented one the previous October to take on vacation, because the transmission had gone out on the automobile I owned.  We loved it... so I told my husband I wanted to buy one when we traded again.  I have loved it!  It's a big roomy ride, yet gets great gas mileage.  The first 3-4 years, it would get 31 mpg on the highway... and 27 around town.  It is older now, and the mileage has dropped a little, but I still get 29 mpg on highway.  It is has never had a mechanical problem.  I have kept all routine maintenance up to date, and with 120,000.00, I still do not want to get rid of it.  I hope it will continue giving me such enjoyment.  "

I looked for another PA but couldn't find one up to my standards so I started looking at LeSabres. I found a 2004 Celebration Edition with 60,xxx miles, one owner local trade in Excellent condition very well maintained. I was hesitant at first because it is 'smaller' than my previous Park Avenue but it blew me away with the interior room and large trunk not to mention all the bells and whistles. It's a fully loaded Limited plus xm radio, chrome wheels, eye cue display, embroidered leather seats and a dealer installed spoiler! 33mpg is standard on highway. Perfect Buick ride and style."

Heater and A/c work excellent and i also jumped a hard 6 foot snow pile with a few buddies and it took it like Trump took his presidency, we flew like an eagle through the sky and landed perfectly like the challenger flight, and continued to burrow through the snow (which was no match for the beast). overall 10/10 would recommend.

My biggest complaint are the split-bench leather seats.  After 2 to 2.5 hours in the seat your rear end gets mighty sore.  You wouldn't think so when you first sit down on the seat as it is well padded.  I had trouble with the dual climate control system.  The driver's side quit working and was cycling hot air-cold air-hot air, etc. The car drives nice going straight but very poor at any kind of spirited handling.  I find the car rather boring to drive but my wife likes it as it is really her car to drive.  The LaSabre is a well equipped car with power everything."

buick,lesabre,2004,DMCnTN, 01/27/2010,An ok car,3,"Bought in fall of 2008 at car lot that deals in high mileage vehicles that look ok. Had 106000 intially. I've added about 15000. Gas mileage on interstate = 31 mpg. good power. comfortable for trip. Negatives are AC sometimes blow hot air on driver side and cold air on passenger. Also, hard shift every few days (1st to 2nd, 2nd to 3rd). Guesstimate from dealer on repairing both problems = 900 bucks. Two front chrome mag wheels leak air around the rim unless you get tire store to sand and goop up the rim. Overall car is good transportation given that I gave $5100 for a 4 year old car. Our 2 Hondas have been much more trouble free (everything works right)over 300k miles on those 2 together."

Because it's an American car, the used car price was better than buying a comparable but smaller Japanese family sedan.  Only some minor problems, which I expect from American cars.  The dash and radio console looked like it hasn't been updated since 1985. I saw a 2004 Honda Accord with more modern design.  The driver side speaker blew out after a month I owned it.  And a month later the gas gauge stopped working so I have to estimate when to fill up gas. No big deal. I will drive this car into the ground.  As long as it keeps running I'm happy."

Comfortable, decent gas mileage, minimal regular maintenance costs and the only one major expense was needing front and rear pads and rotors at the same time.  I get it serviced every 3-4,000 miles, rotate tires often (3rd set in place at the moment) and drive it daily (127K and still going strong). My only complaint is a dashboard squeak I've had for ages and can't seem to locate. I wish they still made this model for when I'm ready again. UPDATE @ 150,000 miles...Still runs and drives beautifully and usual maintenance items have been the only expenses...Console lid broke from hinge but will have repaired ( I use it a lot).
"
buick,lesabre,2005,Bill, 03/15/2010,Oldsmobile Replacement,4,I have driven GM cars always. I got an Olds Delta 88 in 1987 and have had several Olds that have ran perfect with the same drive train in the Olds 88s and 98s -the 3.8 engine is great- GM was smart enough to stay with it for many years. I bought the 2005 Buick LeSabre because it had the exact same drive train as an Olds that GM was stupid enough to discontinue.
buick,lesabre,2005,palmettosunshine, 03/24/2010,"Love my ""old man's car""",4,"Absolutely love my ""old man's car"". Needed another 4 door car after getting married, did my research and knew I wanted a LeSabre.  I work for a Buick dealer and I waited until the right one was traded in.  Got a 1 owner Custom with 67,000 miles and couldn't be happier.  My friends teased me about it until they rode in it, then they got it.  Amazing ride quality, great gas mileage, enormous trunk.  My wife insists we take the LeSabre when we go on trips rather than her 2008 Scion XB.  If you find a low mileage LeSabre, buy it!  You won't be disappointed."
buick,lesabre,2005,Cliff G, 05/13/2017,"Best American automobile, no doubt.",5,"I wish I could find another to hold in reserve.  I use this car for an office on wheels.  It had 36k when I bought it.  It has 146k now.  I had to get the air ride repaired.  Put on one rotor which was my fault and light bulbs.  THAT IS IT except for oil filters, brake pads, air filters and the normal maintenance stuff!  This car goes well in the snow.  Not as good as a 4wd but with a little sense it gets you there.  This car stops very well on dry roads or in snow and has never thrown a surprise my way.  Down on the coastal plain I can get 32 mpg highway if cruising steadily.  Stop and go traffic kills the mileage.  In the hills if I'm not trying to stretch mileage I get between 24 and 25.  This is a big car and the ride is wonderful.  The car is quiet unless you run with a window down.  Front struts now need replaced to help ride but I haven't got around to it.  Speedometer is broken so I use the Garmin.  Car does not have rear headrests in case of accident.  This seats 6.  I wish I could find another with 50k on it.  I would buy instantly!
  Update: The car now has 173K.  Recently had to put wheel bearings on both sides of the front axles.  Engine still does not use oil.  I couldn't be happier with this car.  This car has knocked my 85 Subaru wagon off the throne in the lifelong  ""dollars per mile"" stat and its much more comfortable to boot! 2019 update: I wrecked this car.  I topped the ridge and the other side was a glare of ice.  Antilock brakes did a great job and let me pick the spot to hit the guiderail.  I missed the other cars but totalled mine.  I still miss it 4 years later.... I should have bought it back from the insurance company.

buick,lesabre,2005,zorbogr, 10/08/2009,Best of both worlds,5,I am a used car dealer that only buys low milage 2000-2005 Buick Lesabre's. I have been buying these cars for six years because of the quality and the amazing miles per gal. I get from 30 to 32 mpg on the highway and have never got less than 25 in the city. These were the best selling full size cars in America for ten straight years. (1995-2005) Why Buick quit making them is beyond my imagenation. The new Lecerne with a 3.8 engine only gets 26 miles highway and the numerous buttons on the interior do not say what they are for. You need the instruction book by your side to know how to drive this car. Shame on GM for ignoring the older drivers that made them so much money for so many years!!!
buick,lesabre,2005,rosco1776, 08/26/2013,Love it!!,4,"I got this car from my dad and love it! It only has 27K miles on it and still has the original tires. It rides and runs like a dream. I get a consistent 25mpg combined and up to 32mpg on trips. I've had quite a few Dodge Neons and they get the same gas mileage as this luxury vehicle. My only regret is it's color, silver! I hate silver cars, too blah!"
buick,lesabre,2005,PJ DAY, 10/05/2015,I finally had to let her go....,4,"I bought this 2005 LeSabre in Oct. 2013 from a dealer in Blue Ridge, GA. She was a 1 owner who was no longer able to drive so her husband traded the car in.  I named her Betty Buick. She had just under 92,000 miles on her and was in absolutely pristine condition. Had always been garaged and I thought & was told, well maintained. Literally driven by a ""little ole lady"". 
  I paid just over $8,500 for her and was glad to find her. Back in 2013 these 05 LeSabre model cars were at a premium and hard to find. Us baby boomers wanted the wide front seat instead of cramped buckets and the ride and weight of a hearse. This Buick provided that and more. Talk about a hwy driving car, this baby was built to take long trips ! However, my husband passed away and trips never happened. She was not driven too much. I had to replace the battery and then the problems with the transmission began....Just a little slip here and there and then it was any time she was asked to climb a slight incline...skip, skip, skip and it was getting worse. The engine was terrific and gas mileage out of this world but the tranny must not have been well maintained and it was going out....I also began to suspect the crankcase filter issue that is well documented on this model was a possible problem for erratic stalls that fell into no particular driving pattern. She would eventually crank back up but she could stall out at 65 mps....total loss of power....I began not to trust her even for short trips into town.
   So even though she looked just like she came straight off the show room floor, she needed to find a good home and I had to let her go. She only brought $3,000 on trade with 94,500 miles in on a 2014 GMC Terrain. I will miss her ride. Smooth as silk and quiet, quiet, quiet ! They do not make 'em like this any more unfortunately. I'd have replaced the crank case filter but the transmission was just too expensive. All things being equal a fabulous car !

I bought the 2005 LeSabre Celebration Edition because it was the last year of the LeSabre. It is without a doubt the most comfortable, smoothest riding, most luxurious interior, and quietest LeSabre ever build and I go back a few years. It is so good that I keep it tucked away in my garage and only use it on highway trips and special outings.

Our last Lesabre was a 93 Custom, and was just bullet proof, roomy, and attractive, so after 210,000 miles we traded and bought our '05 brand new. The 2nd time around proved a success. Other than routine maintenance, we've had no problems with this car. Nothing! We're now at 248,000 miles, and thinking we're going to go for the 300k mark, then trade for another Buick. Our Lesabre is just so plush and inviting. Backseat legroom isn't as spacious as our 93 for some reason, but the glove soft leather and stylishness make up for it.

buick,lesabre,2005,Betty Scrogham Conway, 08/19/2015,2005 Buick LeSabre seats burst in flames,1,"I want to make everyone aware who owns a buick lesabre. My aunt owned a 2005 buick leSabre and loved the car because it drove good, it was good with gas miles, the interior had plenty of room. Yesterday my aunt was driving the car coming back from Taylorsville, Ky. and she reached about one mile west of Mt. Washington,Ky. and mom and husband was in the car with her when my mom yelled at my aunt to stop the car because it was on fire. My aunt pulled off of the road and was yelling for help and yelling for everyone to get out of the car and the back seat under on the driver side was burning out of control. In a matter of a few minutes this car was completely destroyed by fire and it is believed the cause of the fire was from the battery which sits underneath the rear seat on the driver side. I am so lucky that my family is alive, but it could have been much worse. I want to make everyone aware if the battery is under the rear seat you will not want a car that is not safe. My mom was with my aunt and she was in the back seat on the passenger side and saw the seat in flames and yelled to my aunt to stop the car because it was on fire. If my mom had not been back there to see the seat burning and my aunt was in the car, this could have been worse. So, think twice before you buy one of these cars because next time it may be you, your children, your parents, or some other loved one.

The car is responsive and handled very well on sharp turns and the standard ABS is a handy feature.  The gas mileage and ride is much better than my V6 1999 Malibu and with less engine groaning too.

buick,lesabre,2005,John Skokan, 12/30/2009,"Great car, won't trade .Keeping",4,"I bought this car for my wife. We bought it brand new. Love it. It rides very nice, like a caddy or Lincoln. Has a 2.6L V6. Great on milage. Has great bucket seats, leather (much more comfortable than cloth. Only two bad points to this car: 1)Body so low to ground, front frame hits tire stops @ parking spaces. 2)I have gone through 6 headlights & about 13 turn, and taillights. I just replaced same turn/tail lights twice in a week. Replaced both headlights in last week. HELP! Can't afford to keep doing this! But, GM, please bring the LeSabre back. Hate the Lacrosse, testdrove one, no good."
buick,lesabre,2005,lesabre custom, 12/25/2005,2005 Buick Lesabre,2,"Not a fun car to drive.  It vibrates and shakes at interstate speeds.  The dealer balanced the tires repeatedly and ended up replacing the tires to no avail.  Buick states that it is normal driving condition due to the newly designed ""active suspension"".  I call it a mistake to buy."
buick,lesabre,2005,Linda C., 09/16/2008,Love my Lesabre,4,"Bought my 1991 Buick LeSabre Limited used in 1993 with 32,000 miles and drove it for 15 years and 224,000 plus miles. Wasn't ready to trade but found out they had been discontinued. I decided to buy another before they completely disappeared! My old one was still running great, no major problems, just the usual battery, brake pads etc., still got 30 mpg on the highway. Found a 2005 Custom with 56,000 miles. It fits like a glove and I expect to get at least 15 years out of this one! Just miss the leather seats, can't ""slide in"" on the fabric! These cars are a pleasure to drive, great in the winter, reliable, no complaints whatsoever."
buick,lesabre,2005,Donald, 02/16/2005,Happy with the car,3,"This is a very good vehicle. It is built with good quality and attention to detail. I would like better handling, perhaps with stiffer springs and struts and larger tires and wheels. It does look old."

buick,lesabre,2005,RED, 09/16/2005,Great Vehicle for a Tall Man,4,"I own two gas hogs i.e. Ford Expedition and Z28 Camaro.  Looking for a vehicle with better gas mileage and space.  Looked at Honda Accord, Nissan Altima and VW Jetta.  All were nice but too small for a man 6'2. I was tired of my head hitting the roof, the emergency brake sticking into my leg and my legs cramped.  Bought LeSabre without sunroof.  Great space and legroom.  So far it gets better mileage than cars previously mentioned.  The only problem is getting one.  Now that they are heavily discounted, they go off the lot as soom as they are delivered. It's funny that when GM finally gets the price right they are terminating a hot seller."

One of the first things I noticed was the wind noise coming in around winshield.  After numerous seat position adjustments I was never able to find one that was truly comfortable.  The bench seat provides very little lateral support.  After my 1 hour commute I feel as if I've driven much longer.  The steering has almost no feel to it (over assisted)."
buick,lesabre,2005,Pepsie, 10/23/2004,GOOD QUALITY BUT SAFETY SHORTCOMING,4,"AGAIN THEY MADE A VERY RELIABLE CAR. 
THERE ARE TWO COMPLAINTS:
1. SAFETY WISE THE DASHBOARD REFLECTS 
VERY NOTICEABLY ON THE FRONT WINDSHIELD 
ON A SUNNY DAY. THIS CAUSE FATIQUE AND 
STRAIN ON THE DRIVER.
2. A MINOR THING BUT WORTH NOTING: THE 
GAS CAP IS VERY HARD TO REMOVE 
ESPECIALLY FOR WOMEN. LEAVING IT LOOSER 
CAUSES THE LIGHT ON THE DASH TO 
SAY ""HAVE ENGINE SERVICED"" THOUGH THERE 
IS NOTHING SERIOUS WRONG."

90mph and provides excellent comfort to 
the occupants.  It is seen by the 
general public as an old peoples car 
and that fits me fine. Have no regrets 
on this purchase"
buick,lesabre,2005,Billy John of MN, 06/05/2008,Why?,4,"GM. Why did you drop this model along with the Park? I have owned 2 Parks and 4 LeSabres. They are far superior to Lucernes which I drove and felt like I was sitting in a boat. Have you ever tried to look to your left rear from a Lucerne drivers seat? My neighbor traded his Lesabre on a LaCross and regrets the day he went in to the Buick dealership. Except for the plastic intake manifold part which has failed on nearly all of my 3.8 cu motors, the motor is superb! Why did you let the problem go on year after year unfixed? However no foreign or domestic comes close to the size and the mileage (27-29 highway) of this comfort machine. That's OK. Humble yourself and bring them back. Forget California"
buick,lesabre,2005,Rich Bolamperti, 06/24/2008,"Big car, great mileage",4,"My other car is a Hyundai Elantra I get about 22 mpg. The LeSabre is getting 20 mpg city. I drive the Hyundai harder but to get 20 mpg city in a car this large and comfortable is amazing. I love the split bench seat, me my wife and child can all sit in the front like in the old days. I have a plan. Buy a 2 or 3 year old Buick keep it until it is 10 years old, trade it in get another 2 or 3 year old Buick. Have a very small economy car to drive in town and for the longer commute. Drive it into the ground. "

I feel very happy driving this car, it gives excellent mileage, handles very well, even in rainy slick weather. The A/C works great even though our summers are normally quite hot and humid. I have no complaints whatsoever and if I ever need another car it will be a Buick LeSabre for sure. It is so roomy inside and well laid-out...well, I just love my car, can't you tell? :-)"

The seats are somewhat cheaply built, not much padding from or rear and they are sinking down,,,I am not fat.  The cruise just went out but I can live with that..the rear auto leveling went out, I can live with that...It does ride ok, the engine is ok, uses about 8 oz of oil every 1500 miles- I can live with that,,, about 145,000 miles now..steers well and mileage is about 30 on the road.  Head lamps are dated and night time driving could be brighter- tried several up dated lamps,,none worked.   overall,,it runs, it's paid for, a/c works, radio works, amen...wish America still made large cars,,,not happening..

buick,lesabre,2005,Sonshine, 12/07/2020,"Very Dependable, Reliable Buicks",5,"I am very impressed with these cars. I bought my first one, a 2004 Lesabre in 2015. It was a high mileage, but MINT car that belonged to a relative of mine. As time went by, the transmission would occasionally shift hard through the gears. Afraid of a huge repair bill, I traded the car in. This was a big mistake. I came to find out that these cars are known for shift solenoids going bad in the transmission, which can easily be replaced without removing the transmission from the car or doing a complete overhaul. For 5 years I regretted selling this car, especially when I would still see it driving around town. In 2020 I finally found a 2005 Lesabre worth looking at and I bought it on the spot. This one has just under 100,000 miles and is as dependable as the last one. Everything works, no warning lights, parts are very cheap, so easy to do repairs on, great gas mileage, VERY roomy and comfortable car. This car is one of many vehicles I own. I have a $70,000 Cadillac that sits most of the time as I do enjoy driving my $2,500 Buick. So many people I know have good things to say about these cars and the GM 3800 motors in general. They just seem to run forever.

buick,lucerne,2006,Marine, 11/27/2006,Value for money,5,"I was seeking a luxury sports sedan in the $30,000 range and reviewed and test drove a bunch of them, foreign and domestic, For its price, the Lucerne CXL  beats them all, including the highly touted Japanese brands. I had intended to buy the CXL with the V8 for it's high end torque. I had a '96 Olds LSS with GM's tried and true 3.8 liter V6 engine, and my only complaint with it was that it lacked high end torque for passing power, When I drove the CXL with this same engine I was amazed at its pep and passing power, all anyone would ever need, GM has worked wonders with this engine. The car is roomy, has great handling, is comfortable and well appointed inside. Great value for money"
buick,lucerne,2006,Cobble, 03/25/2009,Would buy another one,5,"There have been two annoyances: 1. Readablility of instruments in bright sun is very poor. 2. When very hot; i.e.sitting on hot macadam for hours and/or driven hard, the steering has a tiny ""thunk"" feel on occasion when making a turn. It's been traced to a universal joint in the steering linkage. Dealer got 95 percent of it out, but a slight amount remains. I suspect it might be a design flaw.  Had Lexus LS-400 before. Buick is as good and in many ways better. Recently drove 09 Lexus ES-350. Prefer Buick.  Smooth, silky traveler; head-snapping acceleration; quieter than new Lexus; 19.7 mpg around town; very little roll on twisties (not a sporty car, though); 4-spd is slick. "
buick,lucerne,2006,D Berwald, 01/13/2016,Steering,4,"If you wish to make a U turn, make sure you have enough room as turning radius does not allow for real sharp turns.

buick,lucerne,2006,Jeff, 01/06/2017,It's a Buick,5,"Only owned the car for half a year, but I love it so far.  Not the best on gas, 23 mpg freeway, but not horrible.  It's a comfortable ride, looks better in person than in the pictures.  Lots of interior room, black leather looks awesome, plenty of room for a family of four.   Some reviews complain about it not competing with Avalon's or BMW's, well, that's because it's a Buick.  It's big, it's comfortable, it's not a performance sedan, but it does have power with the Northstar.  Big and heavy, front wheel drive, good for Minnesota's winter.  It is what it is, it's a luxury car with a good mixture of old and new.  If you like full size Cadillac's, Buick's or Lincoln's, then you'll probably like this car.

It has a very quiet ride and decent acceleration for a V6 powered boat of a car. Gas mileage on the highway ranges between 25-26 mpg in the winter to 27-30 in the summer. In town? 18-19. Not that great.
The stock radio went to the recycle yard right away. I had to turn it up pretty much to the extent of it's volume to hear. Chucked it for a Pioneer aftermarket and that solved the sound issues. The drivers seat isn't the most comfortable and the lack of a telescoping steering wheel doesn't help. Trunk space and lack of a true fold down rear seat are also drawbacks."

After two more visits regarding the same problem, the GM advisor recommended that the Dealership check the wires. magic, one of the wires had a short in it which was affecting the oxygen sensor. Problem has been repaired and the car is just humming along.  I would still recommend this vehicle even with my problem since that was not a design flaw but instead a supplier issue with the wiring.

We have long, cold, snowy winters here, but I use the heated seats during long trips even during the summer because of the comfort it gives my back.  Great sound system, smooth ride, and the most comfortable seats ever make this car my all time favorite."
buick,lucerne,2006,James Goodson, 12/19/2009,"First 100,000 Miles",4," My first 100,000 miles in this Buick Lucerne CXL have been a truly awesome experience. I changed a rear tailight bulb...and that's it! The only normal wear items have been 1 set of tires and brakes. Great mileage at an average in the mid 20's but 28 on the highway at 70. Not bad for such a large car. The V6 is absolutely bulletproof with a long history for reliability. Motor is adequate, but at 197 horsepower we're at the low end of acceptable. The plus side is endless quiet cruising ability. Brakes are very good. My wife's Infiniti lives at the dealer, but we can always rely on the Buick. I'm looking forward to the next 100K....unless I buy a 2010 Buick Lacrosse!"

buick,lucerne,2006,Mark D, 04/09/2006,Unexpected - now mine,5,"At 31, I'm suprised I bought a Buick. I had a 2003 Lexus ES300, but needed more space. Quite the benchmark for the next car. Chrysler 300... poor build quality, cheap interior. I had all the intention to buy an Avalon. Then, I went to the auto show in Phoenix, saw the Lucerne on stage and it piqued my interest. So I waited. With the positive reviews, the ""auto"" blogs, research and then in for a testdrive...well, done deal. Though not on par as far as build quality to the Lexus/Toyota, it makes up for it in design, ride, value, safety and the benefits of OnStar. That feature outshines any navigation system offered by the other marks. Top the deal with J.D. Power ratings for the Buick line."

Gets 26 MPG 80/20 mix (highway/city), speeds up to 80 MPH and spirited.
Proven engine.
Absolutely smooth and quiet.
New tires vibrate at certain speeds for 1200 miles (and then 1200 more when rotated).
Horrendous blind spots.
Great road car, crummy to drive in the city.
Powerful on the highway.
Awful seats; extremely sore after driving car (and I'm not old).
Interior materials very cheap, nasty seat fabric.
Ergonomics are bad.
No telescopic steering wheel.
Passenger seat rattles.
Driver seat plastic cracked off.
Would I buy it again?
No.
Tired of quirks.
Probably last GM I buy."

I love the ride of the vehicle and have no complaints about the gas mileage that this V8 gets (22+mph).  My complaint is about the oxygen sensor.  My check engine light has been a problem since 5,000 miles and it all revolves around the oxygen sensors.  I have had the car in for service on 8 times and all but one was for the oxygen sensor. When I took the car in for the PA Annual Vehicle Inspection, Penske Buick had the car for over one week and finally got it to pass inspection after replacing the oxygen sensor and part of my exhaust system.  Thank God for the warranty! Buick has a winner here. Just need to correct this problem."

However, it has one major design flaw that should be corrected. The A-pillar is huge, which when combined with a large side-view mirror, creates a very large blind spot when turning. It is a problem when navigating in city traffic for other cars, but particularly for pedestrians and bicycles. Other than that, it's a great car and I recommend it."

Aligned it. 2nd time changed engine mounts.  I was told to put 800 miles on before returning.  3rd visit they told me the car was to spec and that is just the way it drove.  The service manager was very passive about my problem. 4th visit at my request the wheels were road forced balanced. Some correction was made but the car still vibrates. The service manager said that I might want to replace the tires with Michelins. 5th all the oil drained car towed. 6th the battery quit charging. The car is not safe to drive over 45mph. This car is junk.
buick,lucerne,2006,Clifford Den Otter, 11/12/2015,Great Auyo,4,"WE Bought auto new and only costs to us have been rear brakes, tires, and battery besides normal maintenance. All these are expected. We would highly recommend the Buick Lucerne to anyone. My experience with autos started with a 1938 Packard sedan with twin side mounted tires. The 2 problems are a poor turning radius and being a large car, some parking spots hard to get in and out of. I recently traded it in on a Toyota Prius. My 2 sons have Prius's and I feel now that the Prius is the best value and car on the road I also have a 1956 Tbird.

buick,lucerne,2006,Hy. Lasker, 12/27/2005,Super American car,4,"This an excellent car, fun to ride and handles beautifully. The value is great considering the features that are available in the car. The size is excellent for my needs, no foreign car can match it, especially at this cost. The long term reliability will have to be proven with time. But, I have confidence that it will from what I have experienced so far."

buick,lucerne,2006,Linda Whitley, 06/16/2008,Disappointed and disgusted,3,"I have had my car for 2 years now. The car only had 7000 miles on it when the first oil leak was discovered. I have had it in the shop 3 times for the oil leaks, 5 times for fuel sensor, 1 time for traction sensor, once for the rack and pinion.  It is in the shop now for the same noise it was make when they replaced the rack & pinion but they said it is not the same problem, but can't find what it wrong."

buick,lucerne,2006,Stan Bowers, 06/27/2006,2006 Lucerne,2,"Have owned (3) Park Avenues in the past 12 years. Looked with anticipation to the Lucerne. Found a vibration  throughout that has not been fixed even though wheels were balanced twice. No trunk key entry. Gas filler flap opens when touched. Great for those disposed in siphoning out your gas. Because of recessed instrument panel dials, can not see them in the daylight. Steering is much too stiff. The ride is ""harsh"" and the noise level is no better than my Camary, or Miata Rides like a pick up truck.  Engineers have gone to great lengths to ruin the traditional great ride associated with Buick. Very disappointed in this car and would like to get rid of it as soon as possible."
buick,lucerne,2006,mimaw67, 10/20/2012,Inside out something breaks every month,2,"Since i have bought this car I have had to have 2 of four doors fixed one wouldnt open other had the handle come off, The power window regulator went out! Motor mounts broke & Now transmission going out! The plastic around the front seats have all broken! Not a car to have, more issues then any other car i have had! "
buick,lucerne,2006,RAM, 09/28/2006,Fuel Gauge incorrect,5,"Overall, I am happy with this car. However, the fuel gauge does not give me accurate readings. If I start the car on an unlevel surface the gauge will not give me an accurate reading. Depending on whether the car is on an incline/decline the gauge will give me a higher/lower reading (off by a 1/4 reading) than what is in the tank. According to Buick, this is normal and it may take up to 10 miles of driving for the gauge to correct itself and give me an accurate reading. This makes no sense at all. I am not pleased."
buick,lucerne,2006,Big Ed, 12/28/2005,Nice Car,5,"Just picked up my Lucerne CXL-V8 48 hours ago but so far I love it. Buick finally built something that caught my eye.  Ordered a dark blue one with chrome wheels, it looks great and I enjoy the Northstar V8 power. Have been getting some looks on the road, I think people are stunned its a Buick."
buick,lucerne,2006,CK1, 06/07/2006,Lemon of all Lemons,2,After three Honda's I decided to get a roomier family sedan than the Accord.  I heard nothing but good things about the Lucerne.  Within one day of purchasing the right rear passanger door would not open.  Warranty repair.  Three days later there was a loud metallic grinding.  The dust cover for the crankshaft was rubbing against the crankshaft.  Warranty repair.  The keyless remote broke three times.  Three trips to the dealership.  Yesterday the oil pump failed and starved the engine of oil.  The engine has to be completely replaced.  The car is three months old and has 2500 miles on it! I spent most of those miles driving to get it repaired.  I am going to attempt a GM buyback.   
buick,lucerne,2006,charles, 07/04/2006,Driving pleasure,4,This is a very quiet comfortable automobile. I enjoy driving this car as it has good power and handles very well. Avg. weekly driving I get twenty miles per gal. and expect this to rise as the car gets more mileage on it. 
buick,lucerne,2006,Noel, 07/24/2006,Needs tighter turning radius,3,"Have had car for 3 months. Just got out of shop to repair major coolant leak. Dealer very nice, loaned us another Lucerne. Car is extremely quiet, peppy and smooth and overall comfort is good. On down side, is very hard to park due to excessive turning radius, poor visibility due to wide pillars at windshield. Gas mileage not as good as on my old 97 Lesabre with 3.8 Engine. Doesn't seem as stable at high speed as old LeSabre was."
buick,lucerne,2006,Don, 08/17/2006,Best Ever,5,"I am a 73 year old male and so have had some experience behind the wheel.  This is by far the best car I have owned.  The ride is smooth and quiet and the quality and fit of the interior materials is better than I expected.  There are better rated cars on the road but considering the price range and target market for this vechile, it would be hard to beat. This is my third car with the GM 3.8 liter V6 and it has plenty of power at the low end where you need it.  I drive freeways 5 days a week and have no trouble merging and cruising along with the traffic flow."
buick,lucerne,2006,jabutix, 08/21/2006,"Try it, you will like it",4,"The car drives and rides beautifully. The family felt wonderful after a 600 mile drive, so conmfortable it is. I was amazed at the gas mileage. Very good for such a big car."
buick,lucerne,2006,Steve Johnson, 04/13/2006,Return to Buick - 27 Years Later,5,"I decided to buy a Buick after a 27 year hiatus after viewing and riding in the LaCrosse.  I decided to purchase the Lucerne because it was roomier.  It most reminded me of the luxury and comfort of the Duece and a quarter.,  The port holes really caught my attention.  The only reason I did not get the V8 was due to availability (none in pool).  The only thing that needs to be improved in the interior is to add an additional 12VDC power outlet at the ft or rr base of the front seat on the bench seat version.  On the exterior option package, please make the chrome 17 wheels standard.  The dark metal ones in VIN 6U145870 are not appealing to admirers."
buick,lucerne,2006,Horace alex jr, 08/28/2006,My driving experience,4,This car does for me what the big boys have without the price.  A very smooth ride with the feal and ride to a much heavier auto.  To this point no problems with realibality.  As much power as one will need in todays driving world.  Fuel comsumption is better than expected with the V-6 at about 19.5 city and 29 hiway.  Very large rear seeting area for 3 normal size indivuals.  Sporty body style .   
buick,lucerne,2006,John Summers, 08/28/2006,Nicest Car I Ever Owned,5,"This car has more bells and whistles than one can imagine.

buick,lucerne,2006,Marcia, 12/09/2006,I love my Lucerne CXS!,4,"I absolutely love my Lucerne CXS! Great ride for passengers! Day after day the Lucerne provides a comfortable and pleasing ride. If I do not drive it every day, I miss ""Sophie"" and she misses me! : ) This truly is an unexpected love affair with my car. I am a past multiple (14years) Chrysler mini-van Mom and was protesting my husband's strong encouragement for the purchase of the Lucerne CXS. (He recalled my delight when sitting in one at the Detroit & Grand Rapids Auto Shows) I continually receive favorable comments and inquiries from friends and complete strangers.

buick,lucerne,2006,06lucerne, 06/14/2007,Think Twice Before You Buy,3,"I've had my 2006 Lucerne for almost 10 months and am getting rid of it in the next week. Vibration/shimmy issues that will not stay corrected after at least seven attempts to repair and three sets of tires.  Also steering wheel issue that has not been corrected and rotors had to be machined already. At a distance, it is a beautiful car but when yous start looking at the details, they've cut too many corners. Some of the interior materials are of poor quality and some of the design details are downright shoddy.  It is not what the Park Avenue was.  Make sure you test drive many miles before you buy!  If I could do it over, I would have bought a Toyota, Lexus or Acura."
buick,lucerne,2006,Nice Ride, 06/30/2007,Loyalty Finally Pays Off,4,"The Lucerne is the perfect match of luxury and performance. An extremely quiet, smooth ride that is firm and responsive. Our daily commute includes a mix of interstate and surface street traffic. The Lucerne 3.8 accelerates as quickly as necessary to meet highway speeds, smoothly merge and maintain traffic flow. We live in an area where road construction is a way of life, and the roads change paths more often than the Mississippi River. The Lucerne handles the rough and winding road without a problem. It is responsive, tight and never wanders. The Lucerne is an ideal car for adults who want a refined yet sleek look, and a well appointed luxurious ride."
buick,lucerne,2006,georgegest, 04/20/2008,Solid cruiser,4,"Bought this car for my wife. I almost only drive it on long trips. It drives and handles well, rides smoothly, is quiet. Mileage isn't bad but I usually hit between 80 and 85 pretty consistently on the long trip across Texas...dull as watching paint dry. Seats are a bit snug but I have back problems and don't experience the problem of comfort some suggest. The Northstar is a good engine but this car needs another gear and it would really fly.  In 18000 or so miles we have only added gas and oil changes."

buick,lucerne,2006,Ken, 06/06/2009,Great Car-Cosmetic Problems,5,"This has been a great car, comfort and style is very good. Gas mileage is really good, over 30 miles per gallon on last trip from Portland Or. to Idaho Falls Id. My problem has been cosmetic,all outside chrome strips on windows have been replaced twice due to rust spots. Since i have just over 50,000 miles now I'm worried about the next time it happens. The finish is also rapidly coming off the wheels leaving black splotches. The dealer refuses to do anything about it except make note of the problem. They blame it on the current problems GM is having for not taking any positive action on it. As I stated 'Great Car', very dissapointed in the cosmetic problems."
buick,lucerne,2006,sequoyah101, 06/27/2009,Not Stunning,4,"My wife insisted on a V8 to replace the Park Avenue so we got this one after looking at an Avalon, 535 and 350GS and a CTS.  If this car had a 6 speed transmission and the engine wouldn't rev so high at cruise (feel like I have to keep my foot in it) and it could get much better mileage (never been better than abt 24 to 25 and abt 20 in mixed driving) it would be great but it doesn't and it isn't but it is OK.  This should be a 30 mpg car like the old PA.  Buick just went too far with the acceleration ""performance"" tuning of this car to no good end.  Like the styling, interior is nice without being fussy though the seats hit me wrong for some reason it is still comfortable enough."
buick,lucerne,2006,Justin Case, 05/29/2006,Lemonade out of Lemons,2,"Wow, what can I say.  Car has been in the repair shop 3 times for various problems since I have purchased it.  Electrical short, Rear trunk malfunction, brakes needed replacement, and starter had to be replaced.  What next?  I traded in my 1999 Lexus GS for this??  took the word of reviewers and did some research, boy do I feel silly now.  I am looking into replacing soon.  For a buyer in my demographic (50, semi-retired) this is really a dissappointment."

I burnt my finger in couple of months when the plastic around the seat started falling off, engine seal broke off and started heating my engine, transmission started slipping, and boy, brakes are very poor. It starts juddering when driving down the slopes and it wouldn't stop. I spent at least $3000 more than the price I paid for this car, and I drove it from $100K to $132K. I decided to sell the vehicle. Now the fun story began. The dealer who sold me wouldn't take the car back. He said he would pay me $2K. Wow!!! This car loses value like a piece of crap.

The Buick dealership told us that they could not locate any upgraded stereo models, but that the standard stereo was great, unfortunately, it is far from satisfactory.  The keyless entry works, however the only way your memory seat will work is to push unlock, even if your car is already unlocked and in your garage.  Teh heated seats work well. I'mdisgusted with the Nav system. The only reason we didn't buy the Lexus ES350 was because we were told that OnStar had a new navigation program. They don't tell you it doesnt work if you are not in a Verizon wireless coverage area!  Now we are trying to take it back!"

I found a cable hanging loose under the car.  The sunroof would not close until I repaired it.  I have not been able to get ""Mr. Goodwrench' to repair anything on this car. The driver's seat races forward when I unlock the car, before I can get in.  And they are more problems with this car, the Lucerne CXS. I currently have a commplaint filed with BBB."

It is fun to drive a great value and has been problem free. The leather seats are comfortable, XM radio is great and the park assist is valuable in this size of car. I urge to check out the Lucerne as you'll probably end up buying one! It's a great value and has a 4 year/50,000 mile warranty. Plus, it's much less expensive to maintain than any of the imports I've owned. Less expensive and the same build quality, how can you go wrong?"
buick,lucerne,2006,mbarker, 07/16/2009,Great Cruiser - but little else,3,"I bought the Lucerne due to a job change that requires that I drive 125 interstate miles roundtrip each day.  Very comfortable/roomy car that is very quiet.  It was made to cruise the highway.  Even with the V-8 it's not very spirited and it handles like a bus.  It was not made for evasive or sporty driving.  The fuel mileage has been on average about 26 mpg with 90% of driving on the highway.  The cooled seats are great and keep you comfortable in hot humid weather.  The Harmon Kardon stereo is average at best.  It has the Continetal tires and there is a vibration the dealer can't get rid of.  They claim ""excessive road force variation"" and it's not covered by the certified warranty.       "
buick,lucerne,2006,John Gavin, 07/26/2006,Lucerne rating,4,"I have had this for only a few weeks but the more I drive it the better I like it.    However, there are two negative points that I have found, one is gas mileage is not as good as my 2001 LeSabre and the other is that visibility to the rear is not good in my opinion."
buick,lucerne,2006,JJB, 11/22/2005,A bargain,5,"What an impressive vehicle for the price.  Current LeSabre and Park Ave owners will feel at home, yet the quality is far superior.  I have owned both the LeS & Park, and the Lucerne is priced about $5000 below those cars comparably equipped.  Very quiet, excellent quality, looks substantial.  I encourage anyone who thinks that the Toyota Avalon is the only game in town to do themselves a favor and try American!!  The car is larger than it appears in pictures.  I have only about 100 miles on it, but I reset the fuel economy calculator when I picked up the car and have averaged about 28.5mpg.  The V-6 is even smoother than before, and the stereo is excellent.  Great job Buick!!"

Quality, oh yeah! Performance is really good, seating could use a little more support. I have had no trouble with options. I just can't say enough about ride quality, handling, and performance. It is more comfortable than any Benz, Ford, Mercury,or Chrysler that I have looked at in this price range.  Thanks GM, you have a real winner in the Lucerne. "
buick,lucerne,2006,David, 11/10/2008,Concerns,4,Overall the car is good but there are some concerns. When I drive beyond 50 mph the car starts to fishtail; the steering increases in play and is not as responsive. The car lacks basic performance and sounds like the transmission struggles when accelerating. The car is very comfortable and smooth but this should not be at the expense of basic performance.
buick,lucerne,2006,Adina, 01/16/2008,Low quality interior craftmanship,3,"This car handles very well, doesn't get good gas mileage, but it's been reliable. But I wasted too much time in the dealership for minor but annoying fixes. Right now it's at the dealer's, again, for probably the 5th or 6th time. I had gaping wholes in the posts liner, the headliner is not trimmed at the windshield, started rattling and is ragged. I've had a rattling speaker replaced. Dashboard lights are on supposedly not because there's anything wrong with the devices they warn about, but because some absconse electrical parts are defective (unclear answers from the mechanics annoy me as well). And the latest: a bulge in the tire. "
buick,lucerne,2006,Elizabeth Clark, 01/27/2008,Life Saving but Fishtailing,4,"Safety features saved my life; in avoiding a sideswipe, my car fishtailed. It wasn't easy to correct; very slow steering feedback. My last correction may have worked, had the steering been more responsive.  All safety features & OnStar worked in my wreck & helped me whenever driving. I hit a light pole & metal fence at 60 mph. I'm bruised, sore, fractured collar bone; but I walked away.    Compared with other cars I owned, the Lucerne wasn't as agile in handling in tight situations. Quick steering feedback is a must, or you will over correct. The '06's slight pull right ~ at least sent me into a metal fence and pole, not an embankment of trees. I had stability control and did not flip. "
buick,lucerne,2006,CG, 12/13/2005,WOW!,5,"I've owned appx. 6 DL88's and a Buick LeSabre over the past 15 years - all new.

buick,lucerne,2006,Gene Endicott, 12/22/2005,Buick has a winner,4,"We just took delivery of the CXL 6 cylinder on Dec 15, it's a crimson pearl which is a beautiful color.  I've driven others including the Toyota Avalon, and the Lucerne is the pick of the litter.  We've just driven 250 miles, but other than fuel economy it is a pleasure to drive.  The 6 cylinder  has plenty of power and quiet and smooth running.  As far as I'm concerned Buick has a definite winner!"
buick,lucerne,2006,George, 12/28/2005,Affordable luxury,4,"V-8 gives this vehicle quick response, with none of sluggishness in my previous Auroras. Tends to swerve a bit on quick turns or lane changes. Very roomy inside for all passengers front and back with firm but comfortable seating. Side vision is a bit obscured between the placement or width of the  roof beams. Trunk release is awkwardly placed in glove box. "
buick,lucerne,2006,TBP, 01/03/2006,Knocks your socks off!,4,"I waited for months to buy this car.  I've always owned GM and been pleased, so I was really excited to see the Lucerne come along.  I bought my loaded CXL V8 one week ago and am embarrased by the attention it generates.  This car is tight, beautiful and very fast - really.  During the first two days I found each feature was exactly what I would have wanted and smiled to myself knowing I had made a really satisfying purchase.  It is important that you drive a V8 Lucerne and then perhaps a Lexus or Infinity.  All of your senses will tell you that this is the one. "
buick,lucerne,2006,Sarge, 01/07/2006,Sarge,3,Not as nice as the Park Ave. Small seats. Not much room in the front seat. Coffee holders not deep enough to hold tall coffee without tipping. No place to put a cell phone. Already having trouble with auto seat settings. Radio not working . Small trunk.

buick,lucerne,2006,Bob, 01/18/2006,A good choice for a large sedan,5,"This car is comfortable and very quiet.  It is a real performer on winding roads and on the highway.  I have never driven a front wheel drive with practically so little over steer on sharp turns. GM engineers got this one right.  Found it more confortable than the Avalone and Azera, maybe due to the longer wheelbase. Were I to do it again, I would have bought the V8.  The gas milage on the V6 is not that much different, and you need a little more ""spunk"" for such a heavy car."
buick,lucerne,2006,Buick owner, 01/19/2006,Buy American,5,"This car is a thrust towards a more modern and up to date fun car to drive. I drove it to south Florida and it drives great. It doesn't have a lot of unecessary componenets to drive up the cost, and has all that is needed in a quality car. It is comfortable, responsive, large truck, and is fun to drive. It has OnStar,which no other car has other then GM cars. To me, OnStar is a must, especially for any senior driver. Everybody who has riden in the car with me has complimented it."
buick,lucerne,2006,rolf westgard, 02/02/2006,Who needs Lexus,5,"Have owned LeSabres since '99. Liked comfort, good mpg, and reliability. Handling and styling were average.  The Lucerne keeps the good features of LeSabre and is much improved for styling and handling.  Also quietest car I have ever ridden in. Getting about 25 mpg in local driving like LeSabre. Hwy should be the 30 mpg I got from LeSabre."
buick,lucerne,2006,Oldguy, 02/02/2006,"Way to go, Buick",4,"We took delivery on Dec 15 and have driven 2000 miles since.  We drove an Avalon and the Lucerne is way ahead in styling and equal or above in comfort. The rear assist for parking is very handy and being able to turn the heat on the back of the seat is very comfortable for a bad back.  Everything is positive except for two minor details.  The trunk release is very inconvenient to access in the glove box,and the placement of the compass needs to be back on the rear view mirror. Other than that I'd rate it a 10. "
buick,lucerne,2006,Daniel, 02/05/2006,From Audi to Buick,4,My first GM car since my Chevrolet Citation in 1981.  I was attracted to the Lucerne because it is built over the Cadillac DTS platform. I rented a DeVille a few times wile travelling in California. I was very please with the DeVille. The overall finish is at par with Japanese or German. Let's see if it is as reliable as my father's LeSabre.
buick,lucerne,2006,Marty, 02/22/2006,No More Cadillacs,5,This car is driven mostly by my wife. Almost every day she comments on how much she enjoys it. This car has every conceivable option you would ever need. Otion out any of its competition and the price difference will amaze you. The interior is spacious; the truck is huge. The Lucerne should be on everyones test drive radar. May be the best GM vehicle we have ever owned.
buick,lucerne,2006,Willie, 02/24/2006,Happy Owner,4,"I only looked at the Buick Lucerne & the Hyundai Azera,the Azera offered much more value and a better warranty and many extra features.Both cars could use more trunk space..The Azera is a stiffer ride which is fine,the Buick is a softer ride..Neither offer a automatic release of the emergency brake like the Ford does..The black trim on the Azera is a flat finish and will require a coating to keep it from turning whiteish and fading..The reason I went with the Lucerne is that it is a larger car and a American company..The Azera comes from Korea..I must say if I could afford it I would buy the Azera for the wife who now owns a Regal which has been very good..Both cars are impressive,     "
buick,lucerne,2006,Doc, 03/12/2006,My New Lucerne,4,Easy to handle and a pleasure to drive. The Harmon-Kardon radio with XM is fantastic
buick,lucerne,2006,bill bane, 03/23/2006,Performance Package at a Value Price,4,"I have owned a number of Cadillac STS's and generallly partial to GM products. However, a new STS with the performance trim list was in excess of $60k and the DTS similarly equiped was $50+k. The CXS was priced just under $37k. It has the all the equipment: Northstar, stabilatrack, magnetic ride control, variable raitio steering, 18 inch wheels and more. I enjoy driving this car.  It has ample accelelation and corners well for a large car with plenty of room in the back seat as well as the front. The leather seats and wood trim rival both the domestic and foreign competition.  I popped for the wood/leather steering wheel and wood shift.  I think this car is fun and great value!"
buick,lucerne,2006,Joe, 03/23/2006,"Well Done, Buick",4,"It is about time!  I am really pleased with the Lucerne.  With plenty of interior room and very attractive styling, what a wonderful leap from the old, stodgy designs in Buick's recent past.  I'm really impressed with how quiet the car is and love the many standard features, including the automatic volume adjustment made in the radio at higher speeds to compensate for road and air noise.   I like to move my seat way back and allow my legs to be almost straight in reaching the pedals and this one has all the space I need.   Rides very smooth.  I purchased several neat options including the remote start and heated and cooled seats, which adds to the wow factor."
buick,lucerne,2006,Randy Reddell, 03/27/2006,Best New Car Ever Purchased,4,"Buick got it together this time with the Lucerne CXS.  Great appearance and smooth, quiet ride.  The Northstar V-8 is awesome on power and response.  Built tight and handles smoothly with the 18-inch tires and stabililty-track system.  Interior is elegant in appearance; leather bucket seats are extremely comfortable with every adjustment feature at fingertip or memory.  Interior is roomy with plenty of leg room especially in the back seat.  This car is in the luxury class.  As a previous Cadillac owner, the Lucerne CXS has it all at a great price.  Best new car I've seen for 2006. The Lucerne CXS is top choice for new car full-size sedan. "
buick,lucerne,2006,Bobnym2, 03/27/2006,GM comes through!,5,"GM, in its best days, built full size sedans with a large engine and automatic better than anyone. They seem to be back on track. This car was delivered in flawless condition and does the job it is meant to do: move five or six people very comfortably. The car is quicker than most sports cars at any RPM. It is as quiet as any car. The ride is smooth without floating. On the downside, the variable power steering is too light at most speeds. It is large, but handles mountain roads better than the vast majority of cars. Gas mileage is OK, considering its size. Buy it if you want a practical, quick and comfortable car for a relatively bargain price."
buick,lucerne,2006,Glenn Frohring, 03/28/2006,Pleasant Surprise,4,"I have owned a number of Buicks, including Park Avenue Ultras (last car 2000 model). I am very pleased with this car's performance. It is ""tight""--a term I would use for agile, steady handling, much like a German car. The Northstar engine is super responsive, and emits a NASCAR like growl under accelleration. Seats are comfortable and it has many great new features such as heated windshield washers. Road noise is well isolated at cruising speed. I believe the only down side to this car will be fuel economy. I have averaged about 19 mpg so far vs. an average of 22.5 with the supercharged Ultra."
buick,lucerne,2006,Carey Grant, 03/28/2006,Great car,4,"Buick is back and with a vengance. This is a superior car. It blows away the domestic and foreign competition. If you are looking at  Lexus take a look at Lucerne. The Lucerne is the better value, but more important the better car. Great ride and handliing. Average fuel mileage is running about 23 miles per gallon. Check it out you will like it."
buick,lucerne,2006,azguy, 04/07/2006,Great Car,5,"I purchased my Lucerne CXL with a 6 cylinder 2 weeks ago. I added the luxury package as well as the driver confidence package and my M.S.R.P. was still under $30,000. I have owned several luxury cars in past years and I have to say that the Lucerne dollar for dollar is in my opionion the best overall buy of any new car. the ride is just unbelievably quiet, the leather 8 way bucket seats are extremely comfortable,dual climate control is great & the driver information center together with the OnStar keeps you informed of everything from how many miles per gallon to when you need an oil change. I researced all the cars on the market and the Lucerne was in a class of its own for the price."
buick,lucerne,2006,Southern Guy, 04/08/2006,"Japanese, eat your pocket books out!",5,"Expertly styled and built. Breathtaking interior. I wanted something different from all my coworkers and friends. Boy, does this car have class and style that I just don't find in the Azera or Avalon for that matter. Test drove the Avalon, and Es300 and it seemed more suited as a competitor for the Es. Still chose the Lucerne. It simply seemed to outclass the Lexus and I know the V6 to be tried and true. "
buick,lucerne,2006,Jim Wheeler, 04/11/2006,Lucious Lucerne,5,"Before shopping for our new Lucerne I checked Edmunds.com. One reviewer said (paraphrasing): ""If you think you need more luxury than the new Lucerne, you need therapy."" Those are my sentiments in a nutshell. This is the car GM tried to build 9-10 years ago with the Olds Aurora. My wife and I passed then, largely due to price. With the new Buick Lucerne-CXL, we have just about everything we could have wanted, including the Northstar, V-8; leather seats; and chrome, 17-inch wheels for a lot less money. I was astounded at what we got for what we paid--a $40,000 car for $27,500. It's in the color we wanted, Sagemist metallic. The car is powerful and ultra-quiet. A must-see for a new car shopper."
buick,lucerne,2006,Steve, 04/23/2006,Full of Surprises,4,"Having purchased a new CSX only 2 weeks ago, I have not had time to truly evaluate the vehicle. Many 'available' options were surprising including, automatic tire pressure  reading, monthly system check-up courtesy of On-Star, Air conditioned seats which are great for desert dwellers, the automatic start feature which at first seemed extravagent. When it's 118 deg.F, the air conditioning can cool off the car to a nice 100 deg. from 135 deg. inside the cabin,which is VERY nice for a desert dweller. Another surprise was the large battery----not under the hood, but under the back seat! That and the main fuse bank is actually very easy to get to for servicing. Gas mileage is not great 17- 25."
buick,lucerne,2006,Dave, 05/03/2006,Great American Car,4,Beautifuly built car with the quality I have come to expect with Buick. Fun to drive and plenty of power with the V6. It has the ride of a much more expensive car and great handling. Minimal road noise and good sound system.
buick,lucerne,2006,Al Peterson, 04/26/2006,Awesome!,5,"Its a beautiful car, the quality is great, and the fuel economy is better than expected. A real game changer from Buick."
buick,lucerne,2006,Maury, 05/06/2006,Hot,5,"New warranty great improvement. What a feeling of luxury and at a modest price! Handles like a dream on the open road, fantastic steering responce with little roll on normal curves. Plenty of power even with V6 loaded heavily, but will not compete with V8,s of 300 horsepower. Interior identical to Cadillac with same features and controls. Very quiet!"
buick,lucerne,2006,Stan, 05/08/2006,"A great new car, the Lucerne",5,  This is one of the quietest cars that I have been in and that includes my brother's Mercedes.  You ride in complete luxury while traveling down the highway. It is also one of the best looking cars on the road.
buick,lucerne,2006,RDS, 05/21/2006,My Buick CXS is a Dream Vehicle,5,"I initially drove the XL & purchased a CXL for a weekend.  The CXS is a whole different breed of vehicle.  The V8 engine & the 18-inch wheels make the drive a lot like the Buicks of old.  I love the ride as well as the four pseudo vent holes on the front fenders.  The Northstar V8 has excellent acceleration -- I felt that the V6 engine even though very adequate did not have the smooth acceleration of the V8.  I know that gas is very costly now but the ride & the power of this vehicle make it wonderful.  I feel like a little kid when driving it.  I considered a Cadillac STS but this car was $6,000- $7,000 less with the same engine & drive train.  I love my CXS very much & highly recommend it."
buick,lucerne,2006,Juan, 05/22/2006,My 2006 Buick Lucerne,5,I just had it for three weeks and I really enjoy it.  I always felt that a Buick was a nice riding car and this purhcase proves it.
buick,lucerne,2006,Marilou, 06/03/2006,Excellent Lucerne,4,"This is the quietest sedan I have ever driven.  It is comfortable, reliable, and I have received many compliments on the looks and ride. Due to letting others try it out, it looks like Buick will be selling a few more Lucerne's.  I am averaging 24 miles per gallon in the mountains of North Carolina, 29-30 miles on the expressways.  Buick is and shall be my car for a long time to come."
buick,lucerne,2006,Phil, 06/03/2006,Former LeSabre Owner,4,"Having owned three LeSabres, I have been a loyal Buick owner. I was about to change to something new when the Lucerne came along. It's a great improvement, delivering the comfort of the LeSabre with much better styling.  The 17 inch wheels deliver a smooth comfortable ride. I opted for the Sharkskin ($900.00) paint and find that the color gives the car a more European look. 3 months of driving and very pleased over all."
buick,lucerne,2006,Prkavelver, 06/04/2006,The BEST thing since the Roadmaster,5,"This is one of Buick's finest cars. Owned a Roadmaster in 1996, loved, a true American FULL size car, it's a shame GM lost the true full size lines, but this compares greatly! Very roomy, excellent drive, love the looks, 6 passenger seating is WAY better than the bulky and gaudy center console. My last car was a 2003 Park Avenue, sorry to see those go but this is a fine replacement! Love it, although there could be a manual key open for the trunk, but nothings perfect. Bye-Bye foriegn imports, hello all-American comfort! A true luxury liner! "
buick,lucerne,2006,Wayne, 06/03/2006,Excellent Auto,5,"Drove auto across country two days after purchase. Excellent trip, comfort driving and riding. No complaints, good gas mileage, or 26 mpg. Driven locally since and same positive experience. Did not tire me out to drive."
buick,lucerne,2006,Dandy, 06/05/2006,Lucern CXS 2006,5,"This is the ""ultimate driving experience."" Solid feel with quality fit and finish. This is Buick's best effort."
buick,lucerne,2006,Jim Van Auwelaer, 06/07/2006,Buick has a winner,4,"Owned this car for three months and love its handling, performance, and styling. If you can afford the extra money and the 2 less miles/gallon, the Northstar V8 is the only way to go.  Much more refined than the 3.8 6 cyl.  Also the speed sensitive steering with the V8 makes handling much better.  Without it, the car's steering is too loose and gives the feeling of instability at higher speeds. Quietest car I've ever owned.  "
buick,lucerne,2006,Bobbie, 06/14/2006,Perfection,5,"Nicest car I have ever owned. Quiet & smooth. Lots of things to learn & program. Safety features were important  to me & the Lucerne has them all. Feel safe & secure in that car. Love the way it handles. I look for places to go so I can drive it every day. Took it on a 7 hour trip. The Rain- sense Wipers were extremely efficient. Having all the controls---Radio--- Cruise on the steering wheel. Great Idea. Beautiful, Rich looking interior. Hope to have this car aroound for a long time."
buick,lucerne,2006,Steve Engel, 06/15/2006,The Best Buick Ever,5,"I picked up my new 2006 Buick Lucerne CXL at the dealership on June 9th and drove it immediately from Daytona Beach to Boynton Beach, FL, a distance of 210 miles.  The car was so smooth and quiet.  Up to today I believed the foreign made Lexus had the smoothest and quiestest ride but that title now belongs to the Buick Lucerne CXL.  We've had Park Avenues in the past but this new Lucerne is a much nicer car than the Park Avenue.  Being a native Detroiter, I was glad to see Buick bring back the portholes.  This vehicle is every bit as good as a Cadillac DTS and at a much less price.  We liked the car so well, that we bought TWO 2006 Lucerne CXL's the same day.  "
buick,lucerne,2006,June, 06/17/2006,Great car,5,"I turned in my leased Town Car and opted for a change after 10 years of driving Lincolns.  The Lucerne has surprised me with its comfort and performance. It really competes well with the Town Car.  I took all the options except the sunroof, and opted for the bucket seats in front. The V8 will get up and go on demand! Handles really well. It is a fun car to drive and gets a look over everywhere I go.  I took it to Goodyear for its first oil change and it created quite an interest in employees and customers alike.  "
buick,lucerne,2006,Dog gone it, 06/21/2006,"Very pleased, great car",5,"This is a classy car with comfort and style. Loads of trunk space, rear leg room and glass. Big turning radius and some blind spots in side and rear. Steering wheel controls need wrap around protector to keep from accidentaly touching when griping the wheel.  A bit difficult to exit as bucket seat seems deep and high. I still rate it a 10. On-star is great and already has been put to good use. On 840 mile expressway trip it delivered 29 MPG at mostly 70 mph but including small amount of city streets. In city/express mostly about 24 MPG. I'm satisfied with mileage. Six cylinder is enough power but if you want added zip there is the V8. "
buick,lucerne,2006,seargentslate, 07/04/2006,This is one serious sedan!,4,"I drove so many cars in search of the perfect sedan that had all of the features I was looking for. I wanted something very comfortable with lots of room and little road noise. This car rides so smooth and quiet, there are times when you do not know if the engine is running and you have to press the accelerator to see if it is! My CXL is loaded with Nav, Remote start, air conditioned seets and the awesome sharkskin paint. GM has really outdone itself and they still can build great cars. Buick's 4yr warranty is proof of their confidance. You have to drive this car. Forget Honda and Toyota. This is a serious sedan and at zero percent interest, you cannot lose!"
buick,lucerne,2006,J.S. Martin, 07/05/2006,Lucerne CXS,4,"After reading lots of reviews and taking several test drives, I had narrowed the field down to the Toyota Avalon and the Buick Lucerne. The 0% financing coupled with a bit of patriotism shifted the balance to the Lucerne. So far, I have not been disappointed. The car feels extremely solid and is whisper quiet, even on Oklahoma roads. Acceleration is acceptable, but not exactly breathtaking. This is probably the most comfortable car I have driven."
buick,lucerne,2006,chew54, 07/09/2006,New car problems,4,I just bought this car and I have problems with alignment and the traction control. Hopefully they can remedy this problem.
buick,lucerne,2006,RC, 07/12/2006,Cool Car,4,"Bought CXS with all the options.  Have had the car for about 3 weeks.  Really like the ride and the comfort.  Engine has excellent power and the trans is really smooth.  Have owned a Park Ave. in the past and really liked it.  I have the sharkskin color and it is really an awesome paint color.  I am pleased with the car.  The 18"" wheels give it a very nice look and ride.  Looking forward to many comfortable miles.  Would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a quality car at a very good price."
buick,lucerne,2006,Happy in WinterHaven, 07/13/2006,All around a good vehicle for the price,4,"Have been with GM Since '96. This is my 6th since then. Have been pleased with all but look forward to the better warrenty in this one. Like the retro ports in the design The back is a little plain. Color selection was good. Got the White Gold Flash. Rides very well, seats are comfortable. Plenty of space. Large trunk. Quiet. Found a bubble in the headliner. Dealer Holly was very responsive as usual. Navigation system not as good as my Garmin in some ways, but I had that for three years so I hope I get to know this one as well. I may not be used to it yet."
buick,lucerne,2006,Rich, 07/22/2006,First Buick a Keeper,4,"I've driven the Lucerne CTS for two months, and so far I'm very satisfied. It is a very comfortable, easy handling car, great on the road and very quiet in all traffic.  It has great features, including the park assist, remote start and an outstanding sound system. The controls are straightforward, even those on the wheel and column. The V8 delivers the power; it drives with a robust if not sporty feel.  On the downside, the backseats don't fold down, and the little pass-through port is fairly useless. The 18"" chrome wheels look great but make for a pretty wide turning radius.  This is my first GM vehicle, and so far it feels like a keeper."
buick,lucerne,2006,Shewstring, 07/25/2006,What an American Car should be,4,"I've owned the car for a little more than two weeks.  All I can say is what a refined ride.  Before purchasing this car, I drove a 2007 Toyota Camary and a 2006 Dodge Charger.  The Lucerne's looks, smooth power delivery, refined ride, and silent running sold me.  I have two young girls who now think ""Daddy drives a cool car"".  People walk up and say is that a new BMW or Lexus, they are baffled when I say Buick.  I was pleasantly surprised with a recent 150 mile highway trip, I averaged 26.6MPG @70MPH.  Nice job GM.  "
buick,lucerne,2006,V.J.Romano, 08/03/2006,Buick Evaluation,5,"The car is very new-1000 miles on it. But it is a joy to drive, comfortable and quiet. I like the information about the car as you drive that is available on the instrument panel. The fuel economy is amazingly good for a full sized car. I traded in a Buick for this one and had no problems during the life of it and hope the same with the new one. "
buick,lucerne,2006,Lucerne, 08/03/2006,New Owner Loves Lucerne,4,"We are new owners.  My husband, in the past, has bought Chevy Caprice and Olds Delta 88, would still be driving if they were still available.  Someone suggested we look at the Buick Lucerne and within 4 hours we traded our Chevy Impala for the Lucerne.  He likes the driver's space since he is a tall person and is looking forward to going on a long trip.  "
buick,lucerne,2006,Geonar, 08/21/2006,"So far, excellent",5,"Had to have wheel alignment and tires changed before delivery, because of right pulling, and tires where out of round.  After this correction, car ran good.  False air bag alarm while starting engine, fault cleared after several starts, no record of problem in black box."
buick,lucerne,2006,jsieks, 08/21/2006,Lucerne is a jewel,4,"After 6 months and a 3000 mile road trip to the midwest, I am still beaming about my Lucerne.  Its design, a departure from older Buicks, is forward looking. The chrome portals (four of them) on each side not only designate the car as a Buick but puts a nifty look to the car.  The power of the 8 cylinders in the CXL is very satisfying, allowing for safer changes of lanes on the highway and an occasional ""gotcha"" to all those red sports cars out there.  The average MPG on the highway turns out to be about 24, not too bad for so much power and a 4000 pound vehicle.  And, it is proof that an American vehicle is better than Asian cars"
buick,lucerne,2006,John Horton, 10/06/2005,Awesome,5,"Just got it. Excellent. I can't say enough. So much better than previous generation Buicks. This is a much better car than Avalon, which I also tested. I'm 36, and my buddies think this is one cool ride. "
buick,lucerne,2006,JMB , 11/11/2005,"Stunning car, love it",5,Only had it a week but I just fell in love with the pictures. I was going to go for Infinity or Jag but I wanted to wait for this car. I'm glad I did. No kidding. I work at a law firm and my coworkers teased me that I had bought a Buick. Then we went out to lunch today and they were amazed. Absolutely amazed. One of my partners -- a die-hard Lexus owner -- asked to drive it. He really liked it. 
buick,lucerne,2006,bob politza, 11/23/2005,Finally a great car from GM,5,"I traded in my 2001 A6 2.7t quattro for this car and LOVE IT!  Much quieter than the audi and handles just as good!  Fit and finish is on par with the a6 and the styling is better! I test drove the new Avalon, m35, and tl but this car WON.  It has the best combination of styling, luxury, price, and performance.  This is the first American car I've owned in a long time!  Great car BUICK!!!"
buick,lucerne,2006,AHK, 11/29/2005,Simply a great vehicle,5,"This new Buick has it all, excellent styling, performance, ride, handling, workmanship, etc. Just got it and it is a dream come true. A world class car. GM has come up with a winner. A real head turner. Drives and handles so much better than past Buicks and other vehicles. My wife loves it. So glad we made the choice. First saw it at the Auto Show, and we knew this was the car."
buick,lucerne,2006,john allen newman, 01/12/2006,One Sweet Ride,5,"I just purchased the vehicle this month and can only say that it is one fantastic automobile. The ride is so quiet, you almost don't realize the engine is running at idle. And for those who think that there are some luxury appointments missing, no way. This car is luxury all the way, from the rich leather/wood grained interior, air/heated seats, to the remote starter; yes that's right, remote starter. From 180 feet, you can fire up the engine and have the interior waiting for your arrival at your specifications. The trunk is huge and the 18"" nickel chrome plated wheels make one phat ride. If you want performance and luxury,and spend more than this, you need therapy."
buick,lucerne,2006,Carl Losapio, 01/11/2006,No More Round,4,Best car for the price considering options and quality. Glad to see Buick finally getting away from the Le Sabre look they've had for the past 15 years. The car is tight and handles well in traffic and is smooth on the highway. Visability is excellent and plenty of headroom for my 6'4 frame. I only wish they wouldn't charge me an extra $1000 for my one year of free OnStar. I know it's in the base price somewhere. 
buick,lucerne,2006,Dave, 01/13/2006,An Amazing Luxury Car!,5,"This car was well worth my 6-month wait as it has already exceeded my high expectations.  The comfort, styling, performance it provides rivals that of much more expensive luxury cars such as Mercedes Benz, BMW, Infinity, Cadillac and the like.  It is also fun to learn how to use all of the options and realize how sophisticated the electronics are in choosing how you want to operate the car.  I'm also very pleased with the OnStar service as it is very easy to use."
buick,lucerne,2006,Dan, 01/14/2006,2006 Great Choice,5,"I test drove several luxury brands including Lexus, Infinity, Mercedes, Cadillac and Lincoln.  I stopped by the Buick dealer on a whim, and am so glad I did!  It was ultimately between the Cadillac STS and the Lucerne GXS.  The Lucerne by far was the superior automobile, in style, comfort, and drive.  The Northstar V* is a real plus!"
buick,lucerne,2006,R. B., 01/14/2006,Excellent,4,"Excellent performance; Very smooth ride; comfortable inside; looks great; fun to drive. But when my battery went dead after only 2 days, I could not open the trunk to get at my jumper cables. Trunk lid cannot be opened without battery power. Design flaw. Reason for recall?"
buick,lucerne,2006,Aheadofmytime, 01/16/2006,A winner by any measure.,5,"I've spent the last 3 years mostly in a Camry and was generally pleased except that the Camry is hard to get in and out of and, frankly, is just not that comfortable. I was looking to buy an Avalon which is a better car than the Camry but decided to first test drive the Lucerne CXL.  I bought the Lucerne the same day.  Honestly, I don't know how they can make it so good and sell it so cheap.  I would recommend anyone in the market for a new car to check this car out.  I am extremely satisfied."
buick,lucerne,2006,Robert, 01/27/2006,Buick: Depenable & Luxurious,5,"This has to be one of the best automobiles GM has ever built. I just picked it up a couple days ago, and I love it. I have owned a few GM vehicles in the past, and all I can say is GREAT job. The car rides smooth, drives smooth, and GM was not kidding when they said this car is QUIET. I feel safe in this car being a large sedan, but you feel like you are driving a midsize sport sedan. The craftsmanship of the car is ""Beyond Precision."" Gas mileage is 27-28. This is one car that GM should not have to use rebates to sell, especially when the car is competitively priced. The car won me over, and I said I would never drive a ""grandpa car."" Thinking of a Toyota, think again and try a Buick!!!"
buick,lucerne,2006,goodcarl, 01/28/2006,AWESOME!!!,5,"I ordered my car on Nov. 25 and picked it up on Jan. 25.  This is the first time that I have ever owned an American brand new car.  It was Infiniti 35M or Lucerne. Options on Lucerne not on Infiniti. The acceleration is smooth and quick. You hardly feel the gears shifting. At 70 MPH on the hwy, with the windows closed, the car is so quiet that the only noise you hear is the faint hum of the engine.  It's a little eerie.  Enough room in the back for a football game.  I got two remotes, 1 for memory setting 1 and 1 for memory setting 2. I was using rmt 2 but setting 1 in car.  Hitting mem 1 didn't work too well until the dealer figured it out. OnStar features are exceptional, esp. the phone."
buick,lucerne,2006,RC702, 02/12/2006,Excellent Family Sedan,5,"I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a sedan, especially a family sedan.  It has plenty of power with the V6, the interior is top- notch, and the rear seat room is excellent. Overall, the Lucerne is an excellent value AND a great car.  This Buick is far superior to any other GM vehicle I have ever owned."
buick,lucerne,2006,mehtahim, 02/16/2006,2006 Lucerne is great!,5,Like the sleek styling and comfort. It's roomy with room for 6 passengers if needed. Clean practical IP.
buick,lucerne,2006,Al Yates, 02/20/2006,Performance,5,"I purchased my new Lucerne in January and went on vacation and I thought the performance was great. The ride and quiteness were very good. I have owned Buick's since 1997 and I believe this is the best,judging on the first 2800 miles. I think anyone should be happy with this car. The highway gas mileage was 28 as rated. I encourage anyone to try this full size car."
buick,lucerne,2006,michael, 02/19/2006,Lucerne,5,"Wow!  I have hit the jackpot!! After almost three months, I still get as excited about driving this vehicle as I did the day I bought it.  Buick really deserves credit for getting this one right!"
buick,lucerne,2006,David, 03/03/2006,This is not your Pop's Buick,5,"Finally, the American market can rejoice over an American designed and built car.  The styling, performance and attention to detail is superb. I have had numerous very positive comments from friends and people checking out the car. People have slowed down next to me just to look at the car. Thanks GM."
buick,lucerne,2006,RON MOSLEY, 03/08/2006,Next Generation Buick,4,"I've driven Cadillacs, Park Avenues, Grand Prix's, Lincoln's and others. This is the best of the best. All I have to do is get in and steer, it pretty much does everything else. It sets my seat, turns to my favority radio channel, turns on the lights when needed, turns on the wipers when needed, the radio automatically increases the volumn as your highway speed increases to adjust for any slight increase in noise level due to engine speed etc. What more do I need. The v-8 engine is amazing, far surperior to the v-6. I may not get 28 mpg's, but 25 mpg's with this better preformance is worth it. For those who want a luxury car without the luxury price, look at the BUICK LUCERNE."
buick,lucerne,2006,dave, 03/19/2006,"Best car built for under $40,000",5,"This drives like a much more expensive car. It is totally unlike my 2000 Lesabre, which I really liked. Great take-off great handling and pretty good mpg when I keep it under 70, which is pretty hard. One of the quietest cars I have been in.I extended the 4 year warranty to 6 years because I can't see ever wanting to get rid of this car."
buick,lucerne,2006,Jim, 03/20/2006,Lucerne 2006 CXL,3,"The initial drive was very good.  However, several problems occured immediately.  First the catalytic converter failed and was replaced at 1200 miles under warranty.  Second the engine is giving off noises during acceleration at 2200 miles.  The front seats creak during starts and stops after 2000 miles.  Initially it seems a great car, however I am not so sure anymore."
buick,lucerne,2006,Linda, 03/22/2006,A great new car,5,This vehicle has all of the necessary features that are required in today's luxury cars. The OnStar is a great extra safety feature when traveling a long distance from home.
buick,lucerne,2006,Ally, 03/22/2006,Impressive,5,"This is the most impresive vehicle I have owned in my life.  Well built, quiet, fun to drive, reliable, sporty, and not to mention great to look at!"
buick,lucerne,2006,jsieks, 04/01/2006,Lucerne is worthy of return to American,4,"MY Lucerne is beautiful! The styling is exquisite, color [sagemist] is an eyecatcher.  The response,when pressing the accelerator, is very satisfying. The average mileage fuel consumption is about 20 [city and highway].  That is about 5 mpg less than the stated mileage on the new car window.  GM has pressed the right buttons when producing this car."
buick,lucerne,2006,JDOLANMAN, 04/01/2006,Outstanding car,4,"I have owned this Buick since January 2006 and it is excellent in all respects. It looks good, feels good and it is the most quiet automobile that I have ever owned. Rack up a winner for Buick and General Motors. "
buick,lucerne,2006,cxs, 04/03/2006,Best car I've ever owned,4,"Traded a 2003 Cadillac DTS and was somewhat apprehensive about buying a Buick. This car is more than equal to the Cadillac in ride, appearance, power, quietness and handling. I have been buying new cars every 2 years for the past 50 years, and this is the best car I have owned. If GM changed the name from Lucerne to Lexus they would not be able to keep up with the demand."
buick,lucerne,2006,Len D., 04/05/2006,GM got it right,4,"Vehicle handles great. It's a solidly built vehcile, ride is smooth as silk,  Interior quality is tops, car is extremely quiet.  The best vehcile I've had yet.  Car attracts attention wherever I  go. Everyone is surprised to find out it's a Buick."
buick,lucerne,2006,Susan Lasker, 04/04/2006,A Lucerne experience,5,This car is a wonderful riding car. I have just 6000 miles on it and no problems with the quality or performance. GM hit a bulls eye on this one. It is comfortable for long rides such as 1500 miles to Florida in Jan. 2006. It's fun to drive and found it easy to learn how to use the new gadgets. The car has lots of pep especially for a 6 cylinder. It's quiet and smooth riding. I have seen lots of people stare at the car and admiring it. I think that there is no question that this car is worth every dollar.
buick,lucerne,2006,Teecee, 04/16/2006,New GM owner,4,I am really enjoying our new Buick  Lucerne. The walnut interior is nice. The inside is roomy.  The idea of having side airbags makes me feel safer. My family loves it. We'll be putting it on the road this summer.
buick,lucerne,2006,Derek, 04/15/2006,Nice sedan,5,The Buick Lucerne is a very nice sedan.  We got the almost fully loaded model for around 33k.  The ride is very quiet and smooth and the interior is very spacious
buick,lucerne,2006,Sam Spear, 05/01/2006,Buick finds its way again!,4,"This car is quiet, powerful, well- built, comfortable, and an absolute joy to drive.  The sound system is exceptional.  The drive train is smooth, but gets the car up to cruising speed in a hurry. Mine is Black Onyx and is quite eye-catching.  This is Buick as Buick should be - a premium car in every respect!"
buick,lucerne,2006,Papa, 05/01/2006,The Avalon Killer!,5,"Looked at many full sized cars including Avalon, Amanti and Monteray. The Lucerne trumped them all for ride quality, off the line torque, quietness, trunk space when compared to the Avalon, price and appearance. Every seam and panal is very precise and nothing is out of place. The seats are far superior to the Toyotas and on an even keel with the Amanti. The Buick also has a better warrenty than Toyota and Mercury, 6 passenger room which none of the others have and better reliabilty. Love the port holes, chrome doo moldings, grille and flashy appearance too. Have seen nearly 30 mpg on the open road too. This is Buicks and GM's best kept secret."
buick,lucerne,2006,JaneandWaldo, 05/02/2006,Wow,4,"I have owned 3 LeSabres in the past and have been very pleased with them.  Once I got my hands on this car I was way past pleased.  This car has everything you could want and more.  It has performance, styling, and creature features.  I just love the heated/cooled seats, heated windshield washer, XM satellite radio, and the power from the Northstar V8.  If I could afford to buy another one for myself (This one is my wife's main drive) I would do it in a heartbeat."
buick,lucerne,2006,Carl Losapio, 05/02/2006,Now that I've had it a while,3,"I rated this car shortly after my purchase, and was optomistic about it. Now that I've taken it on a 3k trip, I have some opinion changes. While driving it through mountains at 75 mph, I found myself fighting the wheel. This car did not handle well on curves. I felt unsafe driving it. I also noticed that the turning radius is forever. I have trouble pulling into parking spaces because it does not turn sharply enough. It does have enough power but just handles poorly. The cruise feature is the best but I have turned off every other feature because of poor design. Exit/entry feature was designed by a chimp. Seat retracts on exit, but not on entry. If you dont lock this car it stays retracted."
buick,lucerne,2006,jp, 05/03/2006,Great value,4,"Rides like a dream, quiet and comfortable.  Luxury car for less money that our past Cadillacs or Lexus."
buick,lucerne,2006,A.Markowitz, 05/13/2006,Buick To Buick,5,Chose this car over Lincoln Zypher because of the comfort and styling.Wason the open road and handled very well. Averaged 25mpg on regular.  All extras appear to work with reliability.Has slight pull to right. Will be corrected. Learning to find all other comfort and running features.
buick,lucerne,2006,Ray, 05/11/2006,Great car,4,"The Lucerne is a great car. It is comfortable, has a roomy interior, enough power to satisfy me and not make me feel I can't get on the interstate without a problem. However, several small things have been a problem. The cup holder in the console is a dud. Can't see the heated seat lights in the daytime. The seats squeak and the remote trunk opener should not be in the glove box. Would I buy this car again? In a minute. I can overlook the small stuff because it is fun to drive, confortable and with only 2200 miles, problem free.  The 3.8 engine is old technology, but if past history is any indication, it will run for ever withoiut a problem, and get decent gas mileage for a car this size. "
buick,lucerne,2006,Mike, 05/30/2006,Beats the Imports,5,"The Lucerne is a fantastic car.  Better looks, design, features and quality than any import (including Lexus & Toyota) we looked at.  The car rides, handles, performs better than the imports.  This is a major step forward for GM & the Buick line.  The fit and finish on the care are exceptional.  The standard features make this a great car and the price is very reasonalbe.  The navigation system is better than any offering from Japan or Germany.  We love the car."
buick,lucerne,2006,JNN, 05/31/2006,Lucerne Full Of Fun,5,"The 2006 Buick Lucerne is back to the real Buick!  This automobile is a true Luxury Buick at an affordable price. Quiet, comfortable, style, all only a small part of this exceptional automobile."
buick,lucerne,2006,Jjohn, 06/08/2006,Lucerne is the best buy,5,"I shopped around about a year before I came across the Lucerne CXS. My car is loaded! All of the extras I wanted were standard equipment. When comparing with otherluxury models,  the Lucerne CXS by far was the best buy. The ride is awesome! "
buick,lucerne,2006,paul, 06/12/2006,Lucerne,4,The Lucerne is the quietest and smoothest riding automobile I have ever owned in my 50 years of driving.  It glides along with ease and the Northstar is powerful and quiet.
buick,lucerne,2006,Rod, 06/26/2006,Upgrade from 2002 LaSabre,4,"In comparison to our previous 2002 V6 LaSabre: Lives up to quiet interior claims for engine, air stream and tire noise at least up to 75 mph. Turning diameter is annoyingly greater. Comfortable cruising at 75 vs 70 mph  with LaSabre. Not tiring to drive long distances except for no lumbar support. Entering freeway or passing acceleration was uncomfortable - requires more throttle or even downshift. Average mileage on 4600 mile vacation trip including 3 city stays was 28.5 mpg; only 3.3 % less than similar trip made last year with the LaSabre. Love the exterior design even though I now notice similar features on several older foreign makes."
buick,lucerne,2006,Happy Virginian, 06/27/2006,Great Ride,4,"Smart ride right out the door! Fit, finish and ride are better than Avalon.Interior noise abatement is fantastic, sound system on the mark and dash controls are all easy to use. Glad I waited for Lucerne vs Avalon or Lacrosse."
buick,lucerne,2006,P.Spector, 06/27/2006,Best of Show,5,"Have had Buicks for about 12 yrs and this is by far the best one I have had,  It is everything that is advertised.  It is quiet, easy to drive and I feel great at its wheel.  "
buick,lucerne,2006,bbrassas, 07/13/2006,Lucerne review.,5,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoy driving the Lucerne. It handles well and is a great car on the highways. We think its appearance is great, second to none. All in all, a wonderful car. We enjoy the accessories, especially the automatic windshield wipers, and the automatic seat/mirrors that adjust to each of us. It's the nicest car we've ever owned!"
buick,lucerne,2006,James Peffall, 07/28/2006,Best Car I've owned!,4,"Car is beautiful, quiet, very comfortable,fun to drive with an outstanding sound system and fantasic features including OnStar, rear back up 'radar' and heated seats. We really love this car and it is far quieter than the Avalon we test drove which required premium fuel (the Lucerne takes 87 octane). "
buick,lucerne,2006,herb, 07/29/2006,Great Car!,5,"Drove cross country 2 days after purchasing, wonderful experience. Good mileage, easy to drive, relaxing. Easy to manuver in city trafic and on interstates."
buick,lucerne,2006,Chas. Stauber, 08/10/2006,Luv-it Lucerne,4,"Having owned four LeSabres prior to buying this Lucerne, I can give an accurate evaluation, I think. It is so silent one thinks you should be in a Caddy or Town car. "
buick,lucerne,2006,Excellent Overall, 08/11/2006,Excellent Overall,5,"The Buick Lucerne drives smoothly, handles turns to perfection, and looks great.  I am very pleased with this car and enjoy riding it every day.  I would recommend a test drive and you be the judge.  "
buick,lucerne,2006,Fixation, 08/15/2006,06 CXS,4,"Great car. Many people are suprised to learn that it is a Buick. Superb ride and confident and poised handling. The elegant appearance, and refined interior make this the best kept secret in the automotive world."
buick,lucerne,2006,John R, 08/16/2006,Our Lucerne,4,"We have owned Buicks since 1988.  Our first 3 were all Buick Rivieras - the last two were the retooled luxury sports sedans of 1995 and 1998 and we loved them.  We were most disappointed when Buick shelved the Rivs.   However, even though our Lucerne is 4- door, we equate its handling to that of our beloved Riviera.  It is fun to drive and it is quiet.  And it is sharp looking as well.  After only a couple of weeks my wife and I were both saying - we love this car.  Thanks Buick.  You kept us around by introducing the Lucerne."
buick,lucerne,2006,tom, 08/25/2006,Buick Lucerne,4,I really enjoy the comfortable ride and the soundproofing that was put into this car. Excellent room and has a large truck with low riser that my wife appreciates. Considered an Avalon but this was a better value based on pricing and features. 
buick,lucerne,2006,Ray, 09/01/2006,Stylish enough for the younger crowd,5,"This is the best car I have ever been in. I am so happy to own this car. The 0% does not hurt either. So quiet. I don't have the worry that I would have if I had bought the Huyndai Azera. Toyota fell off with the 2007 Camry and Avalon. Now that I own a Lucerne, I don't want any any of the others. When driving the other cars I still wanted a Lucerne. And I'm only 31 yrs old."
buick,lucerne,2006,not old, 09/07/2006,Buick Lucerne,4,On a recent 2200 mi trip I really enjoyed my drive. I drove the entire trip by myself. I did find that the seats were comfortable and the heated seat helped with  fatigue even in July. Avg about 29 mpg at 75 - 80 mph. There was a problem with the AC dripping condensation on my left foot. 
buick,lucerne,2006,JAY CIPES, 09/07/2006,Fond of first American car in years,4,"We find it a very quiet, responsive, comfortable car.  No regrets.  Just the gas mileage."
buick,lucerne,2006,jollyviking30, 09/08/2006,Good Value,3,"The setting of, and operation of the controls is very confusing. Damn car wants to take over ( ie windshield wipers, lights etc)Brakes are very weak, and I know the pads are going to have to be changed yearly. Mileage is not very good, and no gas station attendant has figured out how to open the gas cap .I love the color and shape of this car. Overall I liked my 1997 Bonnevile better."
buick,lucerne,2006,Perry, 09/13/2006,Great CXS,5,I really enjoy my CXS.  I decided on the CXS over the 300.  It had everything that I wanted and was more reasonably priced.  It is definitely a keeper.
buick,lucerne,2006,Mary M- Ft Worth, TX,A true luxury vehicle,4,"Abeautiful vehicle.  Turns heads everywhere I go.  Very comfortable ride, and extremely roomy in front and back seats.  I am a GM girl, however, this is my first Buick. So far, so good. "
buick,lucerne,2006,Weatherboy, 10/03/2006,Down a notch from Lincoln,4,"Car rides fine, but is a come down from the Continental. The exterior and interior quality is more light weight and lesser quality. Noticed the thinner metal on the hood when washing car.  More likely to ding and dent."
buick,lucerne,2006,Mark, 10/06/2006,Think Twice,3,"I'm not happy with this car.  Right ""A"" pillar is too big, creates a really big blind spot.  Not enought headroom with sunroof if you are over 6' 2"" tall. Car is quiet at low speeds but not so at 70 mph.  Turning radius needs to be tighter, makes it hard to be into my side entry garage.  I traded in a '98 Buick Regal GS, sorry I did.  I loved that car!  Passenger seat rattles at 40 mph, and I already had it into the shop because it pulled to the right just driving down the road."
buick,lucerne,2006,A Gator in Georgia , 10/09/2006,A lot of car for the money,4,"An extremely smooth ride and very quiet, except for some limited engine noise on initial acceleration.  Traded in 4 year old Crown Victoria to get a more comfortable ride for my bad back.  The styling outside is quite modern looking, with only the rear end being slightly less attractive.  On the first tank of gas with one-half in town and the other half on the highway it delivered 24.5 MPG, which is impressive for a 4,000 pound automobile.  Have owned large GM cars since '72 and this one is better than my 1993 Bonneville (300K miles) or my 1998 Park Avenue that were both 3.8 liter V6's.     "
buick,lucerne,2006,sedan, 10/13/2006,Vibration,3,"Vehicle has been in shop 7 times due to vibration in the accelerator, brake pedal, and steering wheel during acceleration. Buick claims that is the way the vehicle is manufactured and refuses to handle the problem. My fifth new Buick! Problem noted on way home from delivery of vehicle. Has 3800 miles currently. Driver's seat is plush, but narrower than my '03 LeSabre."
buick,lucerne,2006,Al Hass, 10/17/2006,Quality American Car,4,"This car has the feel and looks of a luxury automobile and the performance of a sports car. The ride is very enjoyable. Buick has the attention of all ages and within a price tag of reality.I was dissapointed that the Park Ave left but after owning this Lucerne my reaction is ""Out with the old and in with the new""."
buick,lucerne,2006,Davidb, 10/24/2006,Nice full size car.,4,This car is a pleasure in both ride and drive. I had three problems after delivery. Have been working with dealer to correct and have been very satisfied with their response. So far the dealer has replaced three of the Continental tires (unable to Balance). Pull to the right required four wheel alignment. Entire car had what appeared to be overspray  
buick,lucerne,2006,Tom H, 10/28/2006,CXL V8,4,"Have owned this car for 9 months and put over 10,000 miles on it.  Very reliable and comfortable.  Nothing more than routine maintenance necessary so far. Plenty of power, great for long trips. Gas mileage could be better, but still good for car this size with V8 engine."
buick,lucerne,2006,Suzie, 10/31/2006,Wonderful,5,"I love this car. We have always had a truck and to have a car to drive this one is the best one I have ever been in.  It is fun and we turn heads were ever we go.  We have the Sage mist green and Black interior.  When people see this car they fall in love with it. It is a beautiful car, it drives and rides like a cloud, and very quiet."
buick,lucerne,2006,lucern, 11/04/2006,The Best Vehicle For Long Trips,4,"A great ride. Quiet, smooth, and easy handling. Great if you like a roomy interior with soft seats that adjust at a touch of a button"
buick,lucerne,2006,prepress, 11/07/2006,Disappointed,4,"Initially, serious pull to the right.  Finally after 3 stabs the problem was corrected.  Sight lines are terrible for backing out of a parking spot.  Headrests are right in the middle of the side window.  Do not like not having the trunk release available other than key or glove compartment.  No trunk net, why not?  Do not like system for bright lights, too easily clicked without intention.  No cigarette lighter. Gas mileage less than expected on highway.  No drop down seat in back.  Small pass thru is not adequate."
buick,lucerne,2006,happy camper, 12/02/2006,Satisfied new owner,4,"I found the Edmund reviews helpful in makeing my decision to buy the Buick. I really enjoy the Lucerne. In a town where most cars are high end cars fro Europe or Japan. I find the Lucerne a nice compromise. Price at year end $21000 loaded (half of what the European cars I looked at). 4yr /50000 mile warrtanty. Roomy and financially sound for a family, professional looking for work and stylish enough to not feel like I'm driving a tank. For a large sedan with a V6 I find it handles well on the road and just enough power for the car. My car and others I test drove ""all pull to the right"" (as I read in other Edmund interviews) They are fixing it... said it had something to do with a tow bar?"
buick,lucerne,2006,pleased, 12/03/2006,Wolf in sheep's clothing,4,"Great car. Only negative is torque. The pick up can take a second or two, but it can move. All the toys (remote starter, etc) I really enjoy it."
buick,lucerne,2006,jtsummers, 12/14/2006,My Lucerne,5,This is the best car I ever owned and I have owned a lot in my 77 years.
buick,lucerne,2006,JEFF IN TX, 12/28/2006,Love This Car,5,I have only had the car for two weeks and absolutly love it. It has great comfort and plenty of power for me. I traded in a Lincoln town car and couldn't be happier. I would advise anyone to test drive this car if your looking for comfort and safety.
buick,lucerne,2006,27 year old Fan, 12/29/2006,Lexus Who?,4,"I spent a week in the Lucerne over the holidays. Two words: First-Class. The vehicle is large, but drives and feels like my mid-sized car. Smooth power all the way and car is so quiet that people on cellphone didn't realize I was calling from the car! The seats are so comfortable and supportive they feel like my overstuffed chair at home. Fit- and-Finish are superb. I stopped at a gas station and two total strangers commented to me on the looks of the car (both were over 40 however). My wife drives an 03' Lexus ES300. I use to refer to her car as the 'Smoothie Queen' because its a very smooth comfortable ride. With this new Lucerne a new day has begun."
buick,lucerne,2006,ronmckean, 01/08/2007,2006 Buick Lucerne Great Car,5,"The Lucerne is a great value.  Ride, performance and build quality is excellent.  It is a joy to drive."
buick,lucerne,2006,Ron, 02/05/2007,The class of Buick,4,"I live in Michigan and let me tell you it handles the weather with no fear at all. The V8 is roaring to go, the heated wiper fluid melt the ice in seconds, the seats are comfortable yet firm. The ride is quiet yet road heave/pot holes are feathered out."
buick,lucerne,2006,cc079, 03/04/2007,Great Car,4,"If you are thinking of buying a foreign luxury car or a Cadillac DTS save your money and buy this fantastic automobile. The North Star engine is superb and the interior is extremely comfortable. The exterior always receives second looks. OnStar Direction and connections is a good service. Only complaint, why is Buick hiding this vehicle! Buick should be shouting the quality and ride of this car from the mountain tops. "
buick,lucerne,2006,Julius L. Brown, 03/18/2007,Owner of 03 Lasabre and 06 Lucerne,3,"Seat belts cuts into plastic where it comes out of the holder. Should be a harden ring of plastic or metal to stop this. This has already been replaced one time and it is cuting in again. Where headliner comes to the back glass there should be a finish molding strip. I also have an '03 Buick Le Sabre which is  better designed, has a valet key and a button on the door to unlock the trunk which is really nice.  The '06 Lucerne is inconvient to use the fob or go in the glove compartment to unlock the trunk."
buick,lucerne,2006,L. Dillon, 04/18/2007,Not Surprised,4,"I've owned more Buicks than any other car over the years. I've never shopped brands before, with the exeption of Buick. I was originally shopping for a Lacrosse, but didn't want the bucket seats, so I moved up to Lucerne. Glad I did. I even get compliments, lots of compliments, a first for me. I even impressed my mother-in-law. Classy looking and a sweet ride with a solid body and well appointed. Detroit got it right this time."
buick,lucerne,2006,Don, 05/03/2007,Fine auto,4,"This is a fine auto, crafted with care. More economical to buy than Cadillac but similar quality and features. Six cylinder is plenty of power. It is so quiet it has no wind noise and little road hum. The only car I know that you can carry on a conversation front to back seat at 70 mph. Handles very nicely (except tight parking). Impressive appearance"
buick,lucerne,2006,Ed Sheehy, 06/06/2007,"Looks good, but not a Park Avenue",4,"I bought this car to replace my wife's '99 Park Avenue (the best car that we ever owned). It looks wonderful (red w/ tan leather). The 3.8 is a solid performer. However, there is a fair amount of torque steer on acceleration. Over the highway, it does not seem to have the stability that the Park Avenue had. The biggest issue is the flimsiness of the interior door panels-they creak any time that you pull on them. Also the seat belt guides have become worn where the seat belts have sliced into them. It is hardly noticeable but it should not happen! To make matters worse, the parts needed to correct this are on ""nationwide back order"". I guess it is more common than the dealer wants to tell me! "
buick,lucerne,2006,Ron S, 08/16/2007,Kinda wish I'd kept my Park Ave Ultra,4,This is a very nice car but it is definitely not a Park Ave replacement! So far I've not had any problems but I miss the roominess and some features of the 2003 Park Ave Ultra. I miss the Ultra Heads Up Display feature the most but it appears to be not available in any type of sedan style auto. I swore that I would not buy a new vehicle without HUD but I broke down since it appears that no HUD is forthcoming in the next several years models. Center console convenience of this car leaves a bit to be desired. Door and window posts are a bit too thick and impair visibilty. Also needs more infinite steering wheel adjustment so when in driving position view of speedometer is not obstructed.
buick,lucerne,2006,Bizman, 10/02/2007,What a Car!,5,I really love the looks of the car inside and out. I know that GM has finally started making great cars again that can compete with any make. It is a driving dream and the first trip we received 33 mpg at 60 mph on cruise.  Nothing to complain about.  I had looked at a Honda Accord and felt I was getting more vehicle for my dollar with the Buick.
buick,lucerne,2006,cxl v8 4dr sedan, 10/15/2007,Excellent car,4,"This is the best Buick I have ever owned. It has a quiet smooth ride, handles well in tight spots, the V8 gives a positive edge to the  overall performance of the car. So far very satisfied"
buick,lucerne,2006,chas4bass, 07/02/2007,'06 Lucerne,3,"Nice vehicle. Looks fantastic - drives OK.  Too low for freeway driving. Still feels like your ""Grandpa's car""!  Sold as extremely quiet but has developed too many rattles for 18 months. Time to sell it."
buick,lucerne,2006,RDS, 06/12/2007,Buick Lucerne CXS is Wonderful,4,"I love my CXS. I had initially bought a CXL-V6 for a weekend and was not pleased. Once I drove the CXS, I felt that it was a totally different vehicle. The 18-inch wheels, the stabilitrac suspension and the overall ride are wonderful.  On the road it is a dream.  I have nicknamed it ""The Cruiser"" which is what my grandchildren call it when they want to ride in it.  It is very comfortable and I feel safe when driving it.  We live at a time when the #1 thing which people discuss about a vehicle is the gas mileage.  I still feel that the #1 issue should be safety.  Overall, I love my CXS.  It is a wonderful vehicle which I would highly recommend."
buick,lucerne,2006,Ann, 06/22/2007,I love it but,4,I love the car. It is probably the best driving and riding Buick I have had. The only problems are the headliner is sagging in the front and the drivers side door handle pulled out. Took it back to the dealership and have to bring it back when the part for the door handle comes in and an upholsterer will have to work on the headliner. The car has 6000 miles on it.
buick,lucerne,2006,vmcdowell2, 07/15/2007,Buick Lucerne rating,4,"Very comfortable and quiet ride. Very good gas mileage, 30 to 32 mpg hwy, 24 to 26 mpg city. Good assembly. A minor rattle in the driver's door. Good paint job."
buick,lucerne,2007,rod lowther, 10/24/2006,My Lucerne CX,5,"This car has done everything the manufacture said it would and has better gas mileage than claimed. 20.2 city/34+ highway. It is the quietest auto I have ever owned. Steering, precise, excellent power, solid handling. You can whisper to each other at 80mph in this car with no problem hearing. There is ample leg room in the rear seat area for a 6ft + Man, superior thigh support excellent back support.The ride is very comfortable and complements the handling.I am not at all disapointed in this car, It has exceeded my expectations. After 5000 miles I just can't wait till tomorrow morning for the drive to work."
buick,lucerne,2007,Chuck S, 12/21/2006,Best Car I've ever owned,5,Dead quiet. Smooth as silk on the road.  Great handling for this size of car. 
buick,lucerne,2007,Dennis, 01/09/2007,Buick Surprise,5,"Buick Lucerne CXL was the best quality and greatest value. I drove the Cadillac's, Acura TL, Chrysler 300, both Toyota sedans and even the Azera. This sedan is loaded with extras, provides great fit and finish and is truely and luxury car! I researched every car and read the reviews but I think if the car is not an import the published reviews are not as good. I now belive the car press is not open minded about the American made cars! This sedan is worth a drive and you will be surprised at the quality and features. "
buick,lucerne,2007,vt boy, 12/07/2006,New Buick,4,"I replaced an E class Mercedes with a Buick Lucerne due to the poor reliability of the Mercedes. The Buick drives as well as the Mercedes with on road mileage almost as good. Only two features of the Buick bother me, the rather large turning circle, and the total lack of style of the rear of the car. Other than that, I am very satisfied with the car."
buick,lucerne,2007,Robert Forgue, 12/10/2006,Lucerne is my choice over Avalon & Azera,4,"If a quiet comfortable ride is priority one, Lucerne CX will exceed expectations! Built on the same platform as Cadillac DTS it isolates the driver from minor road problems, while Avy & Azera do not!  The Buick engineers have found the perfect balance  between ride comfort and control in the CX model. For those who favor control over comfort the CXL has 17"" tires and a firmer suspension yet delivers a great ride that is not harsh. Auto Level is standard(all models) and  enhances the ride with any kind of load. The engine and transmission smootly deliver performance as needed,quietly and without a hint of the hesitation mentioned in other new cars.  Highway mileage is 30 MPG "
buick,lucerne,2007,cltdriver, 09/08/2006,2007 Lucerne CXS,5,"Worthy successor to the LeSabre/Park Avenue.  The CXS has plenty of room, excellent build quality, perfect ergonomics and a smooth, quiet ride.  I have received many positive comments about the car, including the cocoa/cashmere interior, which is new for 07.  I checked out an Avalon and the quality and ergonomics of the Lucerne are superior.  And no recalls for steering failure or reported transmission issues that have plagued the Avalon.  The Northstar delivers turbine-like power with no audio drama.  You step on the gas and it moves.  The steering is tight and direct which makes this much more of a drivers car than the  Ultra, while still a very comfortable cruiser on the open road."
buick,lucerne,2007,burkewhb, 03/23/2011,Classic American Sedan,4,"I have owned my Buick Lucerne CX for 4 years and had almost no problems with it at all. The
engine and transmission are both very smooth,
and the acceleration, zero to 60 in 9 seconds, is not earth shaking but quite adequate. I love the looks of the car, especially the grille (I got the blacked out grille with ming blue) and the side view. The ride of the car is superb and extremely quiet. 
My only complaints about the car would be the
around town mileage (16) is mediocre and the
turning radius (44ft?) makes parking in tight spaces tricky. Over the road mileage (26) is ok."
buick,lucerne,2007,ibrealfast, 12/09/2006,What a car,5,"I absolutly love the car! It's great looking  and handles like a dream in the mountains. Gas milage is wonderful for a car this size ( over 20 in town and over 30 on the road) and I dont baby it. I did put red line oil products in it like i do everything I drive but the car is in my opinion just great.   I've had 6 Caddys (Devilles) and this car will not only beat them in a race but I think it's more comfortable and is aproximately  $20,000 msrp cheaper, so how good is that? What a value!"
buick,lucerne,2007,HPR, 12/18/2009,My Cream Puff Lucerne,4,"My Lucerne is a Certified Used Car originally leased for 3 years. The instrument cluster legibility was poor and GM upgraded my 2007 under warranty to the 2009 version with LED lit graphics, lit whenever the ignition is on. Legibility greatly improved.  This vehicle is very quiet, smooth and responsive with the 3.8 liter V-6. The powertrain on this model has very high reliability ratings.  I can find no fault with this excellent car, and have invested in a set of Michelin Primacy MXV4 tires. The tires are great and enhance cornering and highway performance VS the Continental OEM tires."

Its built on the Cadillac DTS platform and is only 4 inches less than the DTS. Im only able to get 15 mpg out of the 197 HP V6 in the city and haven't really had it out on the open road to check the highway milage. I love that when its cold outside and you start the car with the remote start, the heated seats and the rear defogger come on. Thats a great idea that GM had when designing the car. The ride is great, its a little floaty compared to my 2007 Toyota Avalon Limited, but thats comparing apples to oranges.The Avalon has 265 HP and gets 18 city and 30 hwy. I was hoping to get the same from the Buick. Oh well"
buick,lucerne,2007,blueride, 08/07/2006,Lucerne,4,"Excellent ride, room, and reliability. Great mpgs for a car this size. Amazingly quiet. Traded a trouble prone 5 series BMW for this one"
buick,lucerne,2007,Brian, 11/28/2006,Lucerne,4,"I just purchased the Lucerne and it is a great car.  I test drove all the different models and the CXS is not even comparible to the others.  Its drive far surpasses the lower models and drives like a dream.  The V-8 is not going to beat up the muscle cars, but it's not supposted to either.  It is very smooth and runs great.  "
buick,lucerne,2007,Repeat Buick owner, 01/12/2007,My new LuCerne,4,"Have had three previous Buicks. This one is really good, but not a good as the old Park Ave or LeSabre. Not enough head room and the seats are not as wide. The rear vision is not as good.  Back seat and trunk are very roomy."
buick,lucerne,2007,tament, 08/03/2010,"Great car, but for driver's seat",4,"I owned this car for 3 years and absolutely loved it. The only, and I mean only, drawback was the driver's seat was a little uncomfortable. I'm a big man and it just wasn't enough seat for me. The back seat was like a limo. Performance was top notch. I never had a single problem with this car. I bought it used and it had been owned by Avis rental and had 32k miles its first year. Then I bought it and put another 35k on it the next two years before opting for a new convertible. However, I did have second thoughts before trading this car because it was a gem. If you are in the market for an a+ sedan this is it."
buick,lucerne,2007,thomasw, 01/24/2007,Very nice Buick,4,I have found a few very minor things that are annoying but nothing that would keep me from buying another Lucerne. I have not had the car back to the dealer for any problems since I purchased the car in March.
buick,lucerne,2007,happylegs, 06/30/2008,"Good car, but not a Park Ave",4,"I own a 2003 Buick Park Avenue, and I bought the 2007 Lucerne CXL in February 2008 as a retirement vehicle. It only took one 400 mile trip to make me appreciate my Park Avenue, and be glad that I did not sell or trade it. I love the way the Lucerne handles on a rainy road; however, the seats are not comfortable, the gas mileage is poor, the entry and exiting process is a torture for me at 6' 2'', and left turns and parking are a chore. My long road trips will continue to be made in the Park Avenue. My wife can drive the Lucerne around town. I will only buy another Buick if they improve on the issues mentioned."
buick,lucerne,2007,C. Sherwood, 10/20/2008,It takes More than Quiet to Make Luxury,3,"Car was a dealer demo. I was sold based on a test drive. It was and remains very quiet and luxurious feeling in that aspect. However, the driver's seat left side molding cracked and broke of its own accord, with a quarter-sized piece popping off and landing in the driver's foot well.  Now, two weeks later, it seems like the entire driver's door interior panel is trying to separate from the metal, with a give of at least an inch when closing the door.  Two months ago, the OnStar stopped working on its own and took 3 tries to fix.  Handling feels weird at 45 mph like Cruise is taking over on its own. Very disappointing all around and I wish I could have my Chrysler 300 back."
buick,lucerne,2007,Buick Man, 02/12/2009,V6 Fuel Pig,3,"Sometimes it feels like the only way I could get the gas mileage to be better is if I pushed it with the engine off! I cannot get this over 21mpg I am not an aggressive driver. I set the cruise between 65 and 70 yet still the avg MPG never goes above 21 on the highway, Sometimes I feel that I should have bought the V8, at least I would have had some power with my cruddy gas mileage (or I may have even gotten better mileage with the V8). Why did GM kill the 3.8? 2000 LeSabre had 15 more hp, better torque and 33mpg on the highway. What/why did they change it?  "
buick,lucerne,2007,william strang, 11/25/2006,Happy Camper,4,My only disappointment is that the city mileage (and I drive conservatively) is only 17 vs the 21 I got from my 2000 LeSabre.  Highway driving is about 27.  A nice car to own and drive.
buick,lucerne,2007,Fred Latshaw, 12/07/2006,Great road car,4,"This is a great road car, fun to drive and very quiet inside. The seats are very comfortable. Not much left to wish for in a car of this price range. A lot of bang for your buck."
buick,lucerne,2007,jbeagle, 04/04/2008,Poor fuel economy,3,"Bought this as a left over and got a good deal. We replaced our 98 Regal GS with this car and have not been thrilled with the mpg.  The dealer tells us everything is working fine and there is nothing to fix, the estimates are based on an outdated criteria that is not realistic. We are averaging less than 20 mpg combined highway/city. Even on long trips we do not see an appreciable gain. Otherwise the car is well made, quiet and very comfortable (bench seat in front), and at 6'4"" that is saying something. For the first 1000 miles there was an annoying vibration int he front during breaking, but as the dealer predicted this has gone away"
buick,lucerne,2007,Lucerne lover, 02/07/2019,"240,000 miles and still no problems",5,"My grandparents purchased this car in 2009, sticking to their ""buy Buick"" policy. My grandparents live ten miles outside of town on a farm, and my grandmother drove this car every day, sometimes twice, to town, for ten years. Gas mileage is quite good for the size of the car and it's engine. Comfort level is extremely high. The car rides like a dream, even after all these years and miles. My grandfather has barely had to repair anything since they bought it, and recently we drove it 200+ miles and back again. My grandparents have purchased another Buick Lucerne; even though they don't make them anymore, they bought a 2011 with low mileage. I now own their old Lucerne and I love every minute. I heartily recommend this car to anyone.

buick,lucerne,2007,Buick Fan, 11/18/2006,Hard to Improve,5,This is my fourth Buick since 1989 including 2 LeSabres and a Park Avenue. The quietness of my test drive convinced me to buy. The luxuriouness of interior and exterior are impressive for the money. Handling with 17-inch wheels is a plus. I love to drive it.
buick,lucerne,2007,Martin Brower, 02/01/2007,Can't See Instruments,4,"When driving during the day without lights, the three dials on the instrument panel are dark. I just came back from the dealer, and he tells me that's the way it is. My wife's Toyota Camry instrument panel lights up during the day. The bottom half of the center dial lights, but the top half with the speedometer numbers is dark. The guage on the right with fuel level etc is completely dark. So is the RPM guage, but I don't need that.  I can't believe that the 2007 Lucerne has been designed this way. Had I noticed this during the driving test, I wouldn't have bought it."

Got the old school split seat 40 20 40. Ii can sit behind me with the seat all the way back. Gas mileage is not what they say, getting 10 miles to the gal not 17 to 19, but I live in Brooklyn, so we stop every 20 feet. I was a Lincoln owner for 30 years. They lost my bussiness and did not care that they lost me. Being old school, the car needs whitewall tires. Put vogues on it. Really a sharp looking car"
buick,lucerne,2007,Ralph Lechner, 12/15/2006,Quality Control At Buick Lacking,4,"Shortly after taking possesion of our Lucerne, we noticed that the headliner in the front right section was sagging. Dealer inspected the problem and said the headliner had to be replaced since the warp in the headliner could not be repaired. It was also noticed that the headliner felt had ""raw"",or frayed, and exposed edges both in the front and rear. Certainly, not a very finished look. To replace the headliner the dealership had to remove and replace the front windshield to enable them to get the new headliner into to car."

The only incident I've had with it was the driver side door handle broke off once.  It was repaired under warranty.  The Northstar 4.6L DOHC V8  with Magnetic Ride Control, Magnetic variable assist Rack & Pinion steering & 4-wheel independent suspension is what makes this vehicle a true pleasure to drive. The power seats afford a multitude of  comfort settings. Luxurious & quiet, yet rugged and sporty.  Can ""hug the curves when needed"" for a vehicle this size.  Acceleration continues to operate flawlessly.  Like all V8's, it's hungry for gas.  However, aftermarket performance parts can help up MPG.    "

Blind spots at center and front roof supports. DIC extremely helpful. Dimming mirror great for night time driving. Front seat lumbar supports too high. 'Had to buy seat pillows for driver and front passenger seats. Rear seats slanted too sharply, making it hard to get out...especially for elderly. OnStar system easy to use.

buick,lucerne,2007,Brian Luedke, 02/24/2007,Neat car needs help,2,"This could really be a hit for GM, but the engine problems that have affected it are not going to help. I have been having a pinging noise with the V-8. GM acknowledged there is a problem with this engine. Yet they continue to sell it. It did not make the noise when purchased, it started at about 1,000 miles. GM indicated this usually happens around 20K miles. Interesting to find out when they wanted my money they did not bother to tell me about potential problems. Now that they have my money they will only give me that they are working on the problem. I'm not satisfied with their answer. Knowing they had a problem, the option should have been pulled. Poor development by GM."
buick,lucerne,2007,Lisa, 08/30/2007,Everybody should own one!,5,"I absolutely love my Lucerne. I've had foreign and domestic cars, but decided to come back to American made cars.  I researched and compared approx 5 vehicles before chosing the Lucerne and all of my friends and family love it as well.  I get told from teenagers that it's a ""hot"" car, all the way to people in their 70's plus who just love it.  Out of all the cars I've owned...and that's been many, this is my very, very favorite!  I wish I could buy one for everyone I know so they could have as much fun as I do.  It's like driving a Cadillac on a smart budget.  You get all the comfort, bells and whistles, while being able to keep some money in your pocket.  Go Buick!  You did great!"

The magnetic ride control and huge tires on this model provides a far better ride than my 2006 Caddy STS that I traded. This is a great highway cruiser. Very comfortable and extremely quiet. You're getting a DTS Cadillac chasis and engine at a Buick price. The white gold flash tricoatfinish and the beautifully finished chrome wheels makes this a real headturner and I have had several favourable comments from passers by. Truly, GM isnt doing itself any favours by hardly advertising this Buick. It is the best car I have owned. If you are considering a Lexus E-350 or full size Chrysler Hemi, this car warrants a test drive"

We (and other riders) are impressed with GM's OnStar performance as well. Seats are comfortable and infinitely adjustable for tall or short drivers. The NorthStar V8 under the hood is a GEM, delivering quiet,smooth solid power. You get a Cadillac in sheep's clothing with the CXS. Road trips are a pleasure!"

I have had people that have commented on the ride, the quiteness, the sport car type handling.  I just say with the price of gas today.  It is the only drawback, in as far of not getting good gas mileage.  But one has to expect that when you have 275 horses to pull you around.  All in all I would recommend the Buick Lucerne to all those that would be considering a Japanese equivelent.  Quailty, performance, price, and better warranty than those from the Pacific rim.  No contest!  "

I was informed by the dealer this would be taken care of.  After a wheel balance and replacement of tires the vibration did not disappear.  I am not satisfied after paying over $38,000.00 and expect GM to correct the problem. This is my 5th or 6th Buick purchase and I have never encountered this before. The console cup holder design; inside storage; storage at the back of the front seat storage has been greatly limited from previous models.  The right hand windshield wiper does not clear road smudge very well. The ride is much quieter and smoother."

Not one problem to report after six months of ownership. Forget the Northstar V8 and stick with the 3800 V6 engine. Its a solid engine with a long track record. I had it in my '92 LeSabre and it was still going strong at 200,000 miles. Getting around 22 MPG in town and averaged 31 MPG highway on a recent 700 mile trip. "

We enjoyed a most confortable ride, it was quiet and with the added secure feeling provided by the OnStar system.  Today fuel economy is important and on 1,379  mile of mostly Interstate we averaged 30.2 MPG, and on 656 miles of rurual travel we averaged 27.4 MPG.

In the first year the car has been back at the dealership for four weeks.  I have had a lot of electrical problems, erratic fan blower twice and remote entry failure.  The owners manual says that the climate control is suppose to automaticly cool and heat with remote start, it does not.  The dealership tells me it is not suppose to.  I guess the owners manual must be wrong,  not!   I have had it back twice for a knock in the steering column.  Turning radius is no very tight.

buick,lucerne,2007,H.Higdon, 10/08/2007,My Buick Rating,3,"With a few exceptions the Lucerne is a fantastic automobile.  It drives and rides like a dream and is the quietest vehicle I have ever ridden in. The drawbacks: visability is poor - can't see where the front or rear is in the case of parking - windows too high obstructing visibility in tight parking areas, can't see parking slot markings. Don't campare vehicle with it's competition in close proximity because the rough sounding 3800 V6 just doesn't sound like something coming from a real classy car.  Gas mileage is also 6 to 7 MPG less than my 03 Lesaber with same engine/trans, etc.  Softer leather on the seats would also help.  Even with these problems, it's a fine road car."

buick,lucerne,2007,John, 06/16/2008,2007 Lucerne CX,4,"Bought this car new over a year ago. Love the design, smoothness & quietness of ride. Get 18.5-20.5 mpg suburb driving and 27-31 mpg on trips. Reasonable pickup. Arrive at distant destinations rested. Somewhat difficult getting in and out, especially for elderly. Seating comfortable but non- adjustable lumbar support too high (I'm 5'll"")and seat seems short front to back. A 2 1/2"" seat pillow corrected the lumbar problem. Roof supports create dangerous blind spots that took  six - eight months to accommodate. Inside trunk release button awkwardly located. After 14000 miles, no mechanical problems. "
buick,lucerne,2007,William H Burke, J ,"Buick Lucerne, beautiful, reliable",4,"I have owned this car for 2 years, and have had absolutely zero problems with it. It does 0 to 60 in 9 seconds, plenty fast enough for me, and has a magnificent ride. I have had several complements from total strangers on how beautiful it looks: I have the blacked out grill with ming blue. The aluminum wheels are nice. Anybody who  compares this car with an Avalon or Azela(?) or Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable is completely out of their mind! My only complaint is the fuel mileage: I get 26 on the open road - not as good as the 29 I got with my 2000 LeSabre."
buick,lucerne,2007,My Dream Car, 11/30/2009,My dream car is now my nightmare,3,Door handle fell off driver's side when I went to open it. Had it replaced. My main problem is that I am riding down the road and it just cuts off. Sometimes it will crank back up but most of the time I have to have it picked up by a wreaker.  This has happen 4 times in the last 3 months.  The dealer cannot find out what is causing it because when they get it will not do it again.  I pick it up and drive it for two weeks and it happens again.  Love my car but am very frustrated with it. I am afraid to go on a trip at all.
buick,lucerne,2007,Thomas Jones, 10/14/2006,"Beautiful car, great ride",4,"Bought the '07 in quartz metallic...WOW, what a looker! Ride is superb and comfort & spaciousness best I have ever seen...I have owned Mercedes in the past."

buick,lucerne,2007,William Burke, Jr.,2007 Lucerne CX owner for 11 years,5,"This has been a great car for the 11 plus years I have had it. Very smooth ride and acceleration, beautiful looks, and very reliable. Unfortunately, things changed all of a sudden when the car reached 60,000 plus miles last November. I heard a warning bell and lost engine power all of a sudden, the engine light turned on, and I got a strange message, ""Reduced engine Power"" on the dashboard. I stepped on the gas, the car hesitated, and then  got up to about 40  MPH but it  didn't feel  right, like the engine was lacking its usual power. I took it to my reliable local mechanic, he changed the throttle body, but the next day the dreaded message came on again. I took it back and this time my mechanic changed the accelerator sensors. Just when I thought everything was good, I got that bleeping message a  third bleeping time! My mechanic this time said there may be a problem with the throttle body wire harness. He took a look at the wires, which were a little damp but otherwise ok, and  cleaned and tightened them. This seemed to finally solve the problem. I'm just hoping I never see that horrible ""reduced engine power"" message again. I'm retired and have high property taxes, getting a new car is out of the question, so this Lucerne has to last indefinitely! If I should ever get another car, though, it won't be a GM vehicle. It'll be a Toyota Camry or a Subaru Legacy. When I was a kid, buying a GM car was like buying a piece of the rock, whether it was a Buick, Oldsmobile, or even a Chevy. Not any more. GM doesn't know how to make decent cars anymore, trust me.

buick,lucerne,2007,TomL, 04/11/2008,Elegant and Reliable,4,"Just turned 25,000 miles today. The computer says I should need my third oil change at around 30,000 miles. So far two oil changes have been 100% of all repairs and maint. Has not been to the dealer since the day I picked it up. How many Lexus owners can say that? While almost no one knows what it is (the styling is a little too bland) all agree it looks inside and out like a modern luxury sedan. Love the sound of the Northstar with dual exhaust. Even with my less than gental driving I average over 19 mpg. With $3.25 gas I guess I would probably buy the v-6 if I had to do it again however."
buick,lucerne,2007,buickman1, 01/10/2007,The Worst Buick Ever,1,"I replaced a 2004 Park Avenue with a 2007 Lucerne, big mistake!  The Lucerne is far smaller than a Park Avenue.  The interior is a joke! It is so cheaply done, as soon as you sit in it for a month you begin to feel like your setting in a Kia.  Buick made their first mistake back in 1996 when they dropped the Roadmaster and now they have really gone looney by dropping the Park Avenue! The interior room in the Lucerne is so small, I felt like I was in a circus car and clowns should have been in there with me. Go with a Lincoln Town Car! The Lucerne is a big mistake, treat yourself with a true luxury car: go with the Lincoln Town Car!"
buick,lucerne,2007,R. Cardiff, 03/16/2008,Very poor fuel economy,2,"As a long time Park Ave owner, I was spoiled.  This Lucerne is no Park Ave! Window sticker showed 28 mpg highway and I have not gotten close to that, 26.3 is best I have gotten and mostly 24 to 25 mpg. On the '04 Park Ave (on the same trips) I would get 31 to 32 mpg. Same engine they say but Buick says they changed the gear ratio and I ask why and get no answer.  I find it difficult to get in and out of and the head room is poor. My next car will not be a Buick Lucerne, unless they improve on the fuel economy. "
buick,lucerne,2007,rich, 08/26/2008,Best car I ever owned,5,"I have owned many cars in my life, but this Buick has almost everything, from the OnStar to a custom paint job. The comfort level is perfect and my mileage is 17 city 33 hwy. I can't wait to buy one for my wife."

buick,lucerne,2007,D Waters, 11/07/2007,The Drivers Car... Buick?,4,"I love cars and I am considered a car nut by everyone that knows me. I have owned over thirty cars and have driven countless more in my persuit of the perfict one for me. I never make a purchase without very extensive investigation. If anyone ever told me that my favorite car would be a Buick, I would instantly recommend they seek professional counseling! The 2007 Buick Lucerne CXL is dollar for dollar pound for pound the best inexpensive (23,000) car I have ever owned. There is nothing on the market today that even comes close for the price. I know because I drove everything in the price range of under 30,000 including Nissan, Toyota, Honda, Chevy, Ford and Chrysler. The car is irresistable"
buick,lucerne,2007,Laurie, 11/02/2007,Pretty but Uncomfortable,3,"Bought it because it was pretty and felt comfortable. After a week of driving to and from work (40 miles per day), my lower back began to hurt. After three weeks I was unable to drive the car. Driver and passenger seats have no lumbar support. Back seat is comfortable. Traded cars with my husband. He now has to drive with cushions on back of seat. Dealer was of no help. They recommended having an upholsterer rebuild the seats which we will try.  We like the very quiet ride and many of the features. Headliner is of poor design with raw edges front and back. Cup holder design is poor."

buick,lucerne,2007,Thompson, 10/09/2006,Great,4,"The workmanship, inside and out, is beyond anything I'd have expected from a US car manufacturer.  Mechanically, the vehicle is beyond anything I expected from the car; it blows you away.  Fit, finish, performance and comfort are unbelievably superior.  I call it the top of the line Caddy without the steroids."
buick,lucerne,2007,Georgia, 02/03/2007,Too Much Air Noise,4,"We love our new Lucerne, except for the air noise that comes in through the windows. We purchased it for fuel economy, comfort and the advertised guarantee of quietness. We average about 24 MPG on the road and it is comfortable. But the door/window design must be flawed because the air noise that comes through the windows at speeds over 45 mph is awful. It is like driving in a wind tunnel. The dealership promises to replace the gaskets around both of the front doors, so we hope that this helps. Just make sure that you test drive on a highway where you can drive over 45 MPH before you buy this vehicle. "
buick,lucerne,2007,KURT PENNEY, 02/23/2007,Absolutely Gorgeous Value!,5,"Originally considering a smaller sedan, I went out and compared estimated mileage and prices. Honda, Nissan, Toyota, and Volkswagen came up short on the quality and attractiveness end, and did not offer substantial mileage savings when models were compared head-to-head on power and price. My CXL has high-end stereo, great looking leather, sunroof, remote start, and is one of the best looking sedans on the road. Ranks with BMW and Cadillac on looks, for the price of an ugly Japanese car."
buick,lucerne,2007,Jeff, 02/25/2007,"2007 Buick Lucerne, great car, fair name",5,"Buick is back. I own a 2007 Lucerne CXS and with the Northstar v-8 and the magnetic ride suspension, it rides and handles better that the Lexus I had, and is quieter too. Mileage with the V- 8 is around 20 mpg for me with a combo of intown and highway driving. On the road doing 80 I get around 24..in town around 18. No creaks or squeaks yet, this is the most solid feeling car I've ever owned."
buick,lucerne,2007,John, 02/26/2007,Initial impressions,4,This car had some vibration when new but cleared up in a few days. Very nice car. Highway trip fuel economy not fully tested yet. Not powerful but entirely adequate.
buick,lucerne,2007,Satisfied Owner, 02/29/2008,Not my father's Buick,4,"This is not my father's buick. We switched from a Mercury product due to styling, leg room, rear seat room.I am 6'-6"" tall and this gives me the room! We can manage about 29MPG on the open road and about 21MPG every day driving, all with regular gas! It has been mistaken for a Lexus ES350 on several occassions. "

Put that with a quiet ride, a super suspension, a Karmon Harman sound system and you have a great car for under $40,000.00. It's built in one of the manufacturing facilities in the country, the BOC Plant in Hamtramak, MI. It matches up favorably with my Lincoln Mark VIII, Chrysler 300, and Missan Maxima. Try it. You might like it."
buick,lucerne,2007,Elizabeth R., 04/01/2007,"Classy style, Great value",4,"This car is a head-turner. It has as much or more style as a much more expensive luxury car. The optional packages are loaded with great features and are a terrific value. The interior is roomy and comfortable. The controls are within easy reach, attractive, and laid out nicely. It has a quality fit, look and feel. The standard sound system is exceptional and OnStar is a lifesaver - it has an integrated phone and navigation service. The car's exterior does not look cheap. I would prefer if it didn't have the side vents, but I've gotten used to them. It is a solidly made car. I wish the car had a little more power, and a 5 or 6 speed transmission."
buick,lucerne,2007,wildfirebuick, 04/02/2007,Best Buick Yet,5,This is the fifth Buick I have owned and is by far the best assembled. The ride is firmer than other Buicks I have had and it makes driving more fun.
buick,lucerne,2007,Chuck, 03/31/2007,Chuck's Lucerne,4,Many features are very difficult to master. Even the seat controls are difficult to master. The width of the driver's floorboard is not wide enough for comfort and seem to crunch large feet. I do like many of the features such as backup warnings and overall appearance. If I had the purchase to do over I would select a different vehicle.
buick,lucerne,2007,Laverne, 03/25/2007,Good Car/ Poor Dealer,4,"Fun car!  Took to the dealer for a minor adjustment. (2400 miles) They did a recall on the remote control.  Today, the ABS warning light, the traction control warning light, and the tire pressure monitor warning light came on and stayed on. Now, we will see if the dealer can undo the miscue. Slightly less ""get-up-and-go"" of my LeSabre.  Otherwise I am pleased with the overall performance and looks of the car."

A few of my friends that bought other cars will say they wish they had riden with me first before they made their purchase. I also love that I get an email each month telling me where I am with tire pressure, oil, and other maintenance.  My wife will trade in our BMW X5 for the new Enclave."
buick,lucerne,2007,Mike, 07/28/2007,This is the best car I have ever owned.,5,"This car has all of the bells and whistles. OnStar is great, and I love satellite radio built in. Comfortable seats and stylish interior. The outside of the car looks sharp. It has the quiet tuning, so it is smooth and quiet inside the car. Just a real elegant, sophisticated driving experience. American made quality, with refined luxury. I'm only 36 and all of my friends rag on me for getting a Buick, but now that I own one I see why all of the older guys out there buy them over an over again!"
buick,lucerne,2007,Mike S, 08/05/2007,Not quite what was advertized,3,"This is not a Park Avenue.  Was told by salesman this was the replacement.  The car is not very comfortable at all; after about 45mins, your lower back/rear end really start to ache. Lent the car to my secretary, she made the same comment.  Have also had the front air deflector fall off 3 times at highway speeds, which Buick will not replace as a warranty item. Finally tore it off and just drive without it.  Heated seats work well, but the AC seat function cools about a 3x8 inch strip of the seat near your crotch, nothing more. If you want a car for long drives, look elsewhere"
buick,lucerne,2007,JEFF SHADOW, 08/21/2007,It Really Should be Called a Wildcat!,5,"I finally relented and traded in our 1998 Aurora with 105,000 miles. It had  virtually no problems. I did not want a Cadillac yet and will never buy an import vehicle. With Oldsmobile gone I turned to Buick and leased a black 2007 Lucerne CXS with the Cadillac Northstar 4.6 litre V8. The Buick now has three ""Wildcat"" badges from the 1968 version and has the style to go with the name. GM should have brought back a name like Wildcat rather than Lucerne. In California a ""Lucerne"" is a half gallon of milk from Safeway, not a county in Switzerland!"

Upon leaving my sister's home after a two week visit and having my old car all packed to return to Florida, it wouldn't start! I'd had problems with it before. Sister screams at me to buy a new car. I remembered my nephew a day earlier telling me about the Buick Lucerne. A car with class and enough room for my 6'5"" frame.I dismissed his opinion. I've never thoughtabout owning a Buick? Sister dialed a family friend and handed me the phone. Turned out to be a salesman for the Buick dealer  I was so stressed i told him to work me a deal and he did. a Lucerne!.The return trip to Florida was fantastic.. I love the car! "
buick,lucerne,2007,thirty year owner, 08/30/2007,Falling apart,3,I have had the car only 600 miles and today as I opened the front driver side door the door handle pulled out of the door frame. It took me a good while to try to get it back in so that I could get into the car. I finally did but have no idea whether the same thing will happen again. I have just had it into the dealer to repair a dent in the make ready opearation and hate to think about having it tied up for another long trip to the dealer. Are others having trouble indicating such sloppy workmanship? Such a mishap makes me wonder whether I can trust the car or not. The so-called cool seats do not cool much of the seat. 
buick,lucerne,2007,John, 08/31/2007,Impressive,4,"I have had SUVs for the past 10 years, the ride from my CXL is impressive. The standard features in the CXL are admirable. I am not impressed with the fuel economy at this point in time. A well constructed quality auto."
buick,lucerne,2007,rlbumich, 09/07/2007,"Nice, quiet, and fun to drive",4,"Owned this vehicle for a week now. Great ride! Quiet cabin interior. Has all the options that I was looking for in a luxury car. It is like I am riding on air. Engine is quiet and I barely notice it--only in high exceleration. Ride is smooth and car handles well in traffic. Recently, JDP has given this 2007 Buick Lucerne a favorable quality rating with Lexus. No problem operating the features of the car and; handles well on the highway and; so far good milege in the city. Some consumers have made quality complaints about their car and I have yet to experience them. Overall, so far, no lemon here! Again, for me this is a fine luxury car not at the high end price! "
buick,lucerne,2007,terry, 09/28/2007,A Park Avenue it is not,3,"I cannot get rid of the vibration, and the seats are uncomfortable. The cooled seats only cool a small portion. The rear of the car looks like a$10,000 car, not a  $35000 car"
buick,lucerne,2007,W. Lifson, 10/05/2007,Poor Visability on Left Turn,3,"When making a left turn, the side view mirror and the wide A pillar block your view of the road. Car was delivered with a faulty Body Control Module (computer) resulting in intermittent error messages. My 2001 Park gave a smoother ride. Fit and finish were very good. Complex electronic driver controls are difficult to master,esspecially for seniors."
buick,lucerne,2007,Doug Lau, 05/26/2007,What a Beautiful Car,4,"Buick has really got it right with the Buick Lucerne. The ride, comfort, quality and quiet rival luxury cars costing thousands of dollars more. This car offers many features found on only the most expensive luxury cars. You get the big car feel when driving this car. The quiet ride is very impressive. GM has a winner here. They need to get this vehicle in front of the public. I have received many positive comments from people when I have been fueling my car. If you are looking for real luxury at a non luxury price, the Buick Lucerne should be at the top of your list of cars to consider."
buick,lucerne,2007,John Wagner, 06/28/2007,Luxury Vehicle,4,This Buick is a very nice road car and rides very well. The fuel economy is very good also. The appointments are also very well coordinated. However the memory on the seats and outside mirrows were not a very easy learning process.
buick,lucerne,2007,Dr Gene, 07/19/2007,Very Good Buy,5,"I traded in a Toyota Avalon for the Lucerne. From the rear they look similar. Beaautiful car. Very comforrtable, heated seats a must for my wife. Milage very good. Engine a little noisy, but not bad. Over all quitness is great. "
buick,lucerne,2007,Mike C, 10/15/2007,Very pleased,4,"Dollar for dollar, this car is the best in its class. I purchased a base model for about $23,000 and at that price none of the other vehicles mentioned was even close in ride, power, or equipment. The Chrysler 300 in that price range is incredibly spartan in the interior and has a seriously underpowered 2.7L V6.  While the 300 and Toyota handle better, this is clearly due to both vehicles' wider stance and lower profile tires, which necessarily create a rougher ride.  If the owner simply wants a powerful, quiet, smooth riding car, rather than one which will take exit ramps at 60 mph, the Lucerne is it."
buick,lucerne,2007,jerry, 06/09/2007,Critique,4,"Had vehicle one week and it broke down, bad wiring at factory. Had it towed and problem resolved. Not happy with gas mileage. Traded a 2000 Cadillac which had same type engine. Northstar V8. Hopefully, the Buick will measure up in time, since gas prices are up."
buick,lucerne,2007,lucerne, 06/26/2007,2007 Lucerne,4,Difficult entry and exit. Doors swing closed when trying to exit. Owner options on computer difficult to do. I liked the LaSabre 2005 much better.

buick,lucerne,2007,Terry, 09/18/2007,It is not a Park Avenue by any standard,3,"The seats are too small and the seats do not cool as they should. The entry and exit system is a laugh.

buick,lucerne,2007,TerryP, 05/26/2020,Pleased with Purchase,4,"I Purchased this car used, 13 yrs old 72,000 miles, This car appears to be well taken care of so I am sure that has helped its longevity but I am very pleased with this car, It rides and handles great it has sufficient power and is very comfortable. I see a couple people have complained about the drives seat, I am not a big man 5' 8"" a little over 200 pounds and for me the seat is very comfortable with lots of position control and I do like the layout of the seat control buttons. The car has a lot of electronics which are all still working I really have no complaints the worst thing so far is it does not meet the gas mileage listed on the sticker I expected it to be a little bit better but it is not terrible. I would very much buy this car again.

buick,lucerne,2007,Mike H., 07/29/2020,2007 Buick LuCerne,1,"Purchased it with 71K miles in 2014. Nice car.  Drove all miles (up to 136K miles) normally. The engine blew up driving 55 mph on the interstate.  so we replaced the engine with an exact model with lower mileage engine (77K miles)  within 6 months, head gasket blew again.  Now we got to spend $1500-$2000 to get it replaced.  2 engines with the same problem.  Normal driving (we are both retired over the age of 57)  Gonna fix and sell it!!!  Be cautious about this model!  We are now!!  Staying away from all Buicks!"

buick,lucerne,2008,rohkey, 08/05/2014,"Great car, maybe a touch expensive",4,"A little baffled by some of the poor reviews I have seen. I'm 24 and have been driving this car for 2 years now, and I enjoy
it. It's spacious, comfortable, quiet, and powerful enough. Never noticed any major handling issues other than the large turn radius, and sometimes it can be difficult to park in large spots. Also there seem to be a few blind spots that can get you in trouble if you're not cautious. The interior isn't as fancy/elegant as I would expect, but it's not bad, and I like how the exterior looks. The trunk is pretty huge, and there is plenty of room for my 6'5'' frame (something I've had problems with in other cars like the Malibu and Impala). MPG's are pretty low, however."
buick,lucerne,2008,Robert, 08/29/2017,Didn't I really rather have a Buick,5,"Looked at a lot of cars before settling on this one which I bought used.  Have driven Lincolns (Mark series), Taurus, Mercedes, and a Caddy.  Must say that this is the most comfortable car I have ever driven.  With the Northstar V8, it is very quick to accelerate  - I had to get used to the electronic gas pedal as it is instantaneous, but the power and smoothness make it fast off the line and it easily and extremely quickly accelerates to highway speed.  I took it for a test drive before I bought it and when I ""floored"" it on the highway, I was truly impressed.  It's got more power than I will ever really need.  I've gotten 17.5 MPG around town and 25.9 on the highway for a combined total of 20.6.  Not great, but not bad for a full size, powerful luxury car.  The interior is soft, roomy, and has easy to understand controls.  Trunk space is great, and my front bucket seats are extremely comfortable for any length trip.   While the turning radius is very large, because I have driven many large cars and trucks/suvs over the years, it's something that didn't take long to get used to.  Fit and finish are incredible, and the Harmon Kardon stereo system is top notch.  The quietness of the interior is amazing and the engine is very smooth and ""purrs"" softly - even under heavy acceleration.  Heated seats, heated washer fluid and heated steering wheel are great extras, especially in the northeast where I live.  I love the lines of the car and it really does look sporty.  I had always thought that the Buicks were for the old folks - luxurious but lumbering cruise mobiles for the geriatric set.  Boy was I wrong.  Not that this car would appeal much to anyone under 35 in my opinion, but it has a sporty style and a lot of power with all the bells and whistles.  Could not be happier with the purchase.  Next car I'll definitely look at the top end Buicks again.  Best features - cooled seats, heated wiper fluid, ride, sound system, styling.  Worst features - turning radius, a few blind spots (but the blind spot assist is a very good aid)
"
buick,lucerne,2008,Anthony Vrsalovich, 06/03/2010,Follow up since buying,4,This is my follow up review since acquiring the car.  Still delighted in all areas. My drive to work is 17 miles each way - I average 20 MPG. Went out last weekend between averaged 60 and 70 mph over a 186 round trip.  Computer showed 25.9 MPG. Not bad for a V8.   Problems - the tire pressure monitored showed an inaccurate reading.  Took it in and they rebooted the computer - Problem fixed.  Apparently the fact the car did not move for a couple of months when I was abroad was the problem.  Everyone that gets in for the first time is very impressed with the drive comfort and lines of the car.  I am one chuffed owner.  I cannot praise the car enough.  The new La Crosse and Regal WOW!

I brought a 2008 Lucerne CSX V8 and I am absolutely delighted with it - and would put it up against any car in its class.  With what I have on my car - I would have to have paid a fortune in extras on the foreign models.  Ultra quiet, fantastic build quality built to incredible tolerances.  The Northstar engine is silky smooth.  Very respectable mph for a V8  Exquisite lines no matter what angle you look at it.  I would recommend anyone looking at a mid or full size saloon to ""a least"" take a test drive at your local Buick dealership.  "
buick,lucerne,2008,Peter, 07/22/2010,Best ever owned,4,I have owned many cars from many makes but my 2008 Lucerne is the best car that I have ever owned. It rides better than any car in its price range. The handling is great for such a large car. No it does not handle like a German car but does not ride like crap over potholes either. No problems at all. The 3800 engine and automatic are among the high quality from any make. I hope to drive this car for the next 20 years.
buick,lucerne,2008,Michael, 10/09/2008,Comfortable and Quiet,4,"This car is very quiet and comfortable. I previously owned an Olds 88 LSS and this is by far a better car. The heated seats are great in the winter. The sound system is good. The build quality is excellent.  I have not found one flaw in the car yet after putting 6000 miles on it. No squeaks or squawks.  This is a well designed car, built to last.  The 3.8L V6 engine in the CXL has a cast iron oil pan.  That's how rugged the engine is built.  All previous 3.8L GM engines that I am familiar with have a formed sheet metal oil pan. This one is cast iron with cross members bolted to it. Built reliable like an aircraft engine."
buick,lucerne,2008,amvee, 06/15/2010,18 months on,4,"My 2008 Buick lucerne v8 csx continues to give me the same driving pleasure as it did on day one. Whisper quiet, silky smooth - like sitting in a lazy boy. A couple of weeks back I did a 190 mile round trip and got 25.9 mpg - using ""Cruise"" between 65/70 mph. Problems - during an oil change I was told that both front bearing were shot. Immediately replaced under warranty with no quibbles ($400 each). I bought the car with 28k on the clock I now have just under 41k. Same suggestions for improvement. Six speed auto and a smaller turning circle. What a superb product line up Buick now has with the enclave, regal and as for the La Crosse . Drop dead gorgeous. Go Buick!"

The Lucerne abounds in them. It's ubiquitous 3.8 litre engine provides all the power one could want unless they are a ""drag racer"" and the car handles beautifully. I have always gotten 27.5 MPG on the road which amazes me in that big a car. I am 72 years old and have owned many cars, foreign and domestic, and the Lucerne is the most satisfactory one I have ever owned."

The sound-proofing is so good that I can't tell whether the engine is running when stopped at a traffic signal. Bought car in New Orleans and drove almost 200 miles home on a 1/4 of a tank. The gas needle didn't move until we had driven 107 miles. I'll keep buying Buicks as long as they keep making them like this. A very nice car for the money.

No wind noise. Fuel economy is what is to be expected with a 292 HP Northstar engine, (20mpg city driving) and absolutely fun to drive. A great many options comes with this vehicle. I've also saved several thousand by buying the Buick over the Cadillac with just about all the same options.  Completely satisified    "

Poor mileage 15-23, acclerator problems,power seat, steering noise, ext temp., worst of all it has left me setting 3 times with a no start, and had to be hauled in on a flatbed. This all has happened in only 4500 miles. I have lost all confidence in GM. I wish I had never traded. Had an 05 LaSabre that was a very good car. Got 23-30 for mileage with no problems, I wish I could say the same for the LuCerne."
buick,lucerne,2008,Bob Muzik, 08/24/2008,Car okay but transmission whines,4,"Traded a 96 Caddy for this in May. After driving a few days, found that the transmission whines loudly in the 15- 30 MPH range. This is the 4T80E transverse transmission which only comes with the 292 on the Super and the Cadillac DTS. GM has a bulletin out on this but a design change projected for early August did not come through. Totally unsatisfactory. GM knew about this way back in 2007 but didn't tell anybody. All other aspects of the car are really good except, as noted below and disappointing MPG. My Caddy got over 30 MPG on flat land and this only gets 25. My 1984 Olds 98 still gets 27. I guess that's progress for you. "

buick,lucerne,2008,E D P, 01/01/2009,"Great Performance, Comfort, and Value",4,"I bought the Lucerne CXS after shopping higher end cars (Mercedes, Jag) and feel that I got a better car for about half the price. The NorthStar V8 engine is smooth and has more power than you could ever need. I get 19mpg town/26mpg hwy. The magnetic ride control suspension and 18"" wheels make for tight, sporty handling around town and a smooth, sure footed ride on the Interstate. The interior is incredibly quiet, well laid out, and the materials are soft. The leather bucket seats are the most comfortable seats I've ever been in and between the seat adjustments and tilt/telescoping steering wheel the car is able to be adjusted to comfortably accommodate both me, I'm 6'1"", and my wife, 5'3""."

Ride has softened somewhat with break-in, but the magnetic ride control is still firmer than in my DTS. Knew I would have to replace the standard Bridgestone tires in order to make the ride acceptable. Replaced tires with Goodyear Assurance Comfortreds (235/55/18) which adds about 1/2 inch to the tires diameter and about 1/4 inch to the car's ride height. The tires made a big difference when compared to the hard riding and noisy Bridgestones. The car, at 2,600 miles, gets about 18 mpg combined vs. 20 mpg with the DTS. This may be due to the performance tuning and the final drive ratio."

buick,lucerne,2008,Frank n Tina Husted, 08/24/2016,Unstable Buick,4,"We had a Buick Lasabre before this Lucerne . Our Lasabre was a super great car with excellent performance and fuel mileage and reliability . The Lucerne is a 2008 and we have had this car for three years now . While we have had this car the water pump has been replaced and we have had numerous issues with the engine light coming on . The first few times were due to squirrels chewing the spark plug wires on the backside of the engine . After the third time of replacing them I covered them with wire loom and wrapped them with black tape . Then the squirrels chewed a couple other wires on the intake air temperature sensor . I soldered these wires and used heat shrink tubing over them . While I cannot blame the car or manufacture for these issues this was just the beginning of the issues . The engine light keeps coming on for numerous times for electrical issues . It came on due to emissions , traction control , abs and more emissions issues . All of these issues seem to be problems with poor connections at the wire plugs . After the connectors are taken apart and very slightly crimped back together , the issues with those particular sensors go away and a new one comes up . I have been chasing these issues all summer long . The only replacement parts I have put on this car is the water pump , which is a part of normal maintenance . I love this car even mainly for the bucket seats in the front . It doesn't ride or handle as good as the Lesabre did . And it certainly isn't as reliable as the Lesabre . We put on well over 100,000 miles on the Lasabre and had NO issues with it whatsoever . I'm sure this Lucerne is one of Buicks few that is full of electrical issues but I still love this car . The fuel economy is not as good as the Lasabre even though both cars had the famous 3.8 engine . One day I will get all the electrical connections taken care of . It is a little inconvenient to take care of these electrical connections , but it is something I can take care of and it doesn't cost anything but the time to do it . This puts a sour note out there for Buick , but I have had other Buicks with no issues at all .

buick,lucerne,2008,Shafted by Buick, 07/03/2019,2008 Buick Lucerne,1,"I purchased a 2008 Buick Lucerne in 2016.  I replaced two fuel pumps.  This car has a major recall.  The circuit box is under the passenger seat.  The metal hinge is too long causing the fuel pump relay to arc this causing a crank no start.  The dealership will try to get you to purchase a new fuel pump.  But you will still have a crank no start until the whole fuse box is replaced and the metal seat cushion clip is shaved off from causing the fuel relay to arc.  The fuel relay also needs to be replaced with a low profile type.  Buick will fix the recall free if the car is under 120k miles.  If you don't let the dealership know that you know about this issue, they will SHAFT you.  Buick did me dirty.

Then there's the gas cap that just fell off.  Wish I paid closer attention to the poor turning ability and less to the cushy seats.

I got a great deal because it is a 2008 and GM was in the midst of financial problems.  I did not go to any other dealer.  I knew what I wanted and got the price I wanted.

I have had the misfortune of being stuck with this car for 2 weeks now (loaner). I can't wait to give it back. The steering column controls are backwards and overly complicated, and everything in the interior feels like leftover parts from a 1990's car. There is good reason for this, its because they are.

buick,lucerne,2008,Lynne, 03/27/2008,Elegant Auto,5,I love this car. It has everything I need and is beautiful to drive and to look at. All the options are very useful and interior room and comfort are great too.
buick,lucerne,2008,luxo, 03/27/2008,Luxury Cruiser,4,"What a quiet ride. When you start the engine, the growl is so calm, you have to check if it's started. Love the pearly white. Also the bench seat where I stretch out and know I'm not going to hit the shifter. The 3.8 liter engine is enough for me. The engine is so quiet, I caught myself on the freeway going 95 mph. Very comfortable"
buick,lucerne,2008,Sorun, 04/03/2008,Love my CXS,4,"Traded my 2003 Deville DHS for it. I like the styling, car looks nice with the 18 inchers. Ride is better than my old Deville and the seats are more comfortable also. The handling and steering are tight with the magnetic ride control and steering. The acceleration seems much better than the Deville too."
buick,lucerne,2008,Chasarms, 04/03/2008,Not your daddy's Buick,4,"I have been an SUV guy for a while and really shopped hard for a larger car before deciding on the Lucerne. I drove several comparably priced imports and found nothing that offered the luxury of the Lucerne as well as the roominess. I also drove a Caddy STS. A nicer car, but much more money. I found the CXS Lucerne holds its own pretty well against the Caddy. The styling is elegant inside and out without being boring or too ""mature"" looking. The car handles well and has plenty of power. The Northstar engine has all the pickup I could ever want. By far, a must have on this car. The ride is quiet and comfortable. I have not given anyone a ride in this car who hasn't commented positively."
buick,lucerne,2008,david, 04/24/2008,Underpowered,4,The car has a great ride. It really is underpowered for its size.  Tried to merge onto a highway and get out of the way of a truck almost got ran over. The standard radio is not very good either.  Replaced the air filter with a k&n got 27 mpg on the highway.  I liked the rain sensing wipers.  They went faster or slower depending on how hard it was raining.  
buick,lucerne,2008,Paul, 05/14/2008,Buick is Great!,4,"I purchased a Buick Lucerne in April of 2008. This is an outstanding car. If you need a full size sedan that comfortably seats 4-5 people...some of them 6 ft 6 inches tall, and rides so smooth and quiet you wonder if the car is running.. you should get this car. I have several kids in college and I have to drive them 5-7 hours one way to get them to school and visit them during the year. A comfortable roomy car was essential. None of the foreign cars could comfortably seat my son who is 6'6"". He either hit his head on the ceiling or had no place for his legs. The Buick was perfect. Quality is outstanding. Performance is excellent even with the 6 cyl engine. Mileage is averaging 21 mpg."
buick,lucerne,2008,frank, 05/24/2008,Comfort and Class,4,"Use this car as my sales office. Had a 2005 Lacross CXS, wanted a bit more room. Ride is very quiet and comfortable. Handling is what you would expect from a luxury cruiser of this size and price. The V6 is suprisingly quick and have never felt underpowered merging on the Freeway, once at cruising speed you have to watch your speed because 90 sounds and feels like 70. Memory seats, heated steering wheel and seats and very comfortable and supportive seats makes long distance drives easy. Get it with the premium sound system, worth the money.   "
buick,lucerne,2008,Al, 05/27/2008,Buick is impressing us,4,"This has been a great vehicle so far. After looking for several months for a replacement to our Chrysler 300 we settled on the Lucerne. We have not been disappointed.  A great smooth ride and quieter than any other car in its class. I am 6'4"" and room was important. This car gives it. The power of the Northstar is impressive without giving up too much gas mileage. It is not as responsive thru the transmission or the steering wheel as the Chrysler 300 but the ride far out weighs that loss."

It has everything on it that you can think of.  I have had no trouble with it.  Never had it to the garage except to get an oil change every 3,000 to 4,000 miles.  I also have a bench front seat which is nice when we have to squezze an extra great Grand child in.  I love the big cars why did they have to quit making them?"

It is beautiful, inside and out, quiet, luxurious, and has an understated quality that very well fits someone who is not about ostentation.  While one might think me biased because a long time relationship with Buick (three generations of Buick owners), I believe that this is the best Buick I have ever owned!  Once again, Buick (for me) has created the perfect 'doctor's car'!"
buick,lucerne,2009,Glinda Craig, 09/15/2015,Buicks Best Ride,5,"This is my second Buick. The first was a Century that was totalled my a red light runner and that car saved my life. I feel safe in my Lucerne. It's comfortable and smooth. My Century NEVER gave me a problem and my Lucerne is as reliable. I'm sold on Buick. Looking for an SUV for vacations. And I'm not using my Lucerne as a trade. I'm going to have TWO Buicks.

Update: 3/21/2018 - My 2009 Buick Lucerne is still humming along.  I have had to replace a tire rod, brakes and rotors but the engine has given me no problems. The tires were changed 2 years ago. I only use premium gas, get my oil, maintenance and tires rotated as scheduled.  I'm probably going to buy an Enclave at the end of the year.

buick,lucerne,2009,jack, 04/23/2009,2009 Lucerne CXL,4,"My first Buick after a long line of Pontiacs, Dodges, Toyotas and Fords over the years.  Reason for choosing Buick was the great looks and an incredible price with GM incentives on what is a high-end luxury car.  First impressions-car looks great in Black with Titanium leather interior.  Smart lines all around outside and inside, elegant and quietly stating luxury.  Strong 3.9L V6 engine coupled with a capable 4 speed transmission.  This is a luxury car not a sports car and tuned accordingly for strong performance but not ""burning rubber off the line"" or ""cornering at 75mph"". The inside is beautiful with no gimmicky controls- logical and within reach engineered for elegance.  I love this car!"
buick,lucerne,2009,unklray, 08/01/2009,Much better than the pros rate it,5,"We have only owned this car a month but it was a service rental and had 5300 miles on it.  At that point it had averaged 20.7 miles per gal. My wife drove it locally a week and it went to 20.8. We drove it 125 miles mostly freeway at 70 mph and got 30.2 mpg. This car drives so smooth, quiet. Plenty of pickup and power. It has everything but the kitchen sink for options. I can't believe all the criticism I see when the pros rate it. Definitely recommend it if you want a great ride and value in a luxury sedan."
buick,lucerne,2009,Mike, 10/21/2009,The Down Side of Safety Equipment,3,"In general, we like the car. It has good safety ratings, but some of this safety comes from thicker roof pillars and side and curtain air bags. The side and rear window size has also been reduced compared to older cars, probably for styling purposes.  The result is reduction in safety due to big blind spots, especially at both  the front and back of the door pillars. Unlke the car we replaced, the front mirrors don't have adequate range of motion to see into the side blind spots . Buick has side blind zone alert avaialble as an option.  We don't have it, but would not buy this car again without it.  The design of this and other modern cars makes this type of system almost a necessity. "
buick,lucerne,2009,mrpleased, 08/26/2009,Love at first drive,5,"This is my second Lucerne. I still have my first. I just couldn't bring myself to trade it in. I just love driving this car. It has been an absolute joy. It is so quite and smooth I sometimes forget that I'm driving. Whenever I give anyone a ride they cannot believe how nice of a vehicle it is. Last year I drove my '06' on a 3000 mile trip and averaged 32 mpg at 75 mph. I was astounded. I think the '09'  will do better based on what I have experienced so far. I shopped hard for a new car in '06' and as soon as I took a test drive of the '06' Lucerne I bought it on the spot. After two months with the '09', I am not sorry."
buick,lucerne,2009,Opadave, 11/11/2009,"My ""Views""",3,"After having this vehicle for about a month, it rides like a dream, except it ""won't get out of its own way. There are several concerns that are certainly safety issues.  The passenger side headrest virtually blocks the drivers view when trying to see through the rear side window.  Front pillar/outside mirror combo on drivers side creates blind spot.  Message center display is difficult to see when wearing polarized sunglasses.  Same conditions probably exist with all models of this design."
buick,lucerne,2009,unklray, 06/12/2010,Underrated beauty,4,"We bought this car from the dealer with 5000 miles on it, it was used as a customer service vehicle. It has every option I can think of since it is the special edition. plenty of power, comfort. Gas mileage consistantly exceeds rating. My wife averages 23.5 in town and we get 28 on trips to Arizona or Chicago. Quiet and smooth is the keyword here"
buick,lucerne,2009,Indymom, 10/24/2009,Smooth,4,"We have owned this car for over six weeks.   My husband's intital reaction was ""we're not old enough to drive a buick"".  He drives a BMW 530 was won by its ride and looks.  In this time we have taken road trips and much city driving. The incentives and generous trade in made it a very affordable.  The interior is understaded but has all the comfort and extras one could want.  The flex E85 fuel presents surprising low cost per gallon but lower MPG as well.  Jury is out on the net savings.  The 60 day guarantee is awesome but our advise is take the cash as you will not be considering a return.  It will become a fixture in your garage if you value comfort, style and convenience.  Its a keeper!"

GM is taking the car back to the engineering dept for evaluation. I will not be getting it back regardless. Another Lucerne (3.9) at the same dealer has the identical problem. I have asked for a replacement with the 4.6 V8 engine or a full refund. Mt recommendation was to have the NVH engineering guys identify the root cause and then have the appropriate product engineering guys fix it.

Only draw back is the blind spots on both sides by mirrors. Also has a aluminum top which makes it very loud when it is raining. Heated seats, steering wheel (Live in Nebraska) remote start which I Love. I'm thinking of trading her in for a SUV, a little higher off the ground.

buick,lucerne,2010,Marie, 09/05/2010,Unsatisfied,1,I recently got a rental Lucerne and it is not good. The gas mileage is bad. It has too many buttons in the inside to set things how you want them. The radio system is bad. If I had to buy one I would rather walk.

After reading all the ratings I am very sorry that I purchased a Buick Lucern, I wish I went with the STS or DTS Caddy.  I will track everything for possible Lemon on this car.  My Aunt and Uncle has a 2007 and always complained about it, I thought they were spoiled with the Park Avenue 2001 they had and compared it to Lucern, rightly so, I think GM has a lot of problems still and this car was not and is not the GM quality that they use to have.  Maybe I should have gotten a Malibu!"

The gas mileage ""stinks""  22.3 on a long trip, never changes.  I'm sure part of that is the ethenol in the gas, but my 2010 Park Avenue was getting 30+mpg with 125,000 miles on it.  I really wish I hadn't bought the car.  I don't look at a car a fun to drive, a car is a necessity.  The ride is not smooth - my 2001 was smooth!

buick,lucerne,2011,ccelpjack, 04/06/2018,My Father's Buick--So What?,5,"I bought the used 2011 Buick Lucerne Super because I had a Buick LeSabre Limited back in the day and drove it cross country with our family.  What a great ride it was on the highways.  Well, the Lucerne Super also has a super ride plus it has a peppy little V-8, excellent navigation, lane departure warning, and blind side warning.  Yes, it has a huge turning radius but I have never turned around in the middle of a 4-lane highway yet.  I bought the car for comfort and it delivers comfort in spades.  Case closed!  Update:  I just completed a 1,000 mile trip of all interstate highways with my family of 3 adults and one child and we couldn't be more happy with the car's comfort, ease of driving, and cargo space.  GM will rue the day it discontinued the Lucerne.  The LaCrosse is a really great car but it's just not in the same class as the Lucerne when it comes to comfort and ease of driving on long highway trips with the family.

buick,lucerne,2011,Mike, 08/26/2019,Epitaph for a great car.,5,"I know the reviews were bad, and Consumer Reports dissed this car no end (although CU owner satisfaction ratings were top-tier for the first several years), but I still love my Lucerne. I tell anyone who asks that it will be in my estate. I have a 2006, burgundy CX, 3800 V6 engine (the 3.9 V6 came later and wasn't as reliable), 6 passenger with 40,000 miles that looks and runs better than the day I bought it 14 years ago. I describe driving it as sitting on a Barkalounger, in my living room, floating on a cloud. I've never had a complaint about the handling or braking, which are both quite sound and very predictable. It's not intended to be a sports car! It does exactly what I want it to. Very old school. The controls are simple and effective, and the sound system is excellent. It gets very poor gas mileage (17 in town, 24 on the highway, though I never drive it much on the freeway anymore to avoid all the pits and scars from thick-treaded SUV tires). Despite being babied, it has suffered the unavoidable leaking front motor mount, and broken (plastic) driver door handle common to all Lucernes. Nonetheless, a couple of days ago, after test driving a 2014 Mercedes CLS (to replace my 2002 Buick Century, which is old and tired), I got back into my Lucerne, with its gobs of light, open space, and soft cuddly seats, and felt as though I had just stepped back into the lap of true comfort and luxury. Cheers to the dinosaurs!

8/28/2020: Still love my Lucerne! I just installed my third battery (after 7-1/2 years, the first went 7-1/2 years as well), AC/Delco. No other problems or repairs during the past year. Purchased a used but new-like 2016 BMW 320i late last summer as a second car. I generally hate it. It handles well and has plenty of power, but the seats are hard, plasticky, low, and tight. The ride is barely tolerable, though the visibility is very good and it is attractive. The point of this discussion is that when I go from the BMW to the Lucerne, I feel like I have just placed myself back into the lap of refined luxury. The Buick has less pep, but the the drive train feels so much more refined than the herky-jerky, dual clutch, buzzy, 4 cylinder revving in the BMW. Sadly, no one makes these big American cruisers anymore, then again, maybe no one would buy them. Either way, I'm keeping mine until I die.

I would highly recommend it as a used vehicle purchase.  The only negative point that I see is the interior design - does not live up to a $30k+ vehicle.  Exterior is very timeless and classy.

The supercharged 3800 model 6 cylinder gasoline engine is known to be one of GM's best small engines, and mine happens to be supercharged.

It's luxurious with leather seats that can be heated in the winter.  I am surrounded in elegant comfort. This 2002 Buick Park Ave has ample clearance under the front bumper and sits up high enough to use the ATM machine at the bank. Plus, the front seats have power lifting to sit higher behind the wheel or for someone with long legs to easily step out of the car.  The sound system - AM/FM, CD, Cassette - are easy to work with while driving and the speakers can switch from front of the car to rear of the car, which allows me to have a good conversation with the front seat passenger. Before buying it I did my research and discovered that the Fuel indicator needle frequently stops working and it's true for this car. (My tank always looks like it's FULL! )  This is fixable, but I just keep track of my mileage and every 200 miles I fill up the 18 gal. tank.    To drive safely, I can see my speedometer reflecting up on the windshield.  This works because of the special windshield.   But, if a rock pings the glass it's expensive to replace, but well worth the investment.  The 4 rear back-up sensors allow me to back up or park with confidence.  This is a good car for a senior citizen or a new 16 year old driver.  It's a reliable, solid vehicle. This is not your great grandpa's car, it's better!

This car is no sports car, but for a large sedan, power is ample (205 hp) and handling seems secure.  In my mid 30's and it has surprised me how much people have commented to me that I bought an old people car.  Buick has a serious image problem.

When we bought it, it was a one owner and less than 40,000 miles. The passenger window motor was broke but I knew that was a common problem for other Buick vehicles from previous experience.
We didn't have it long before everything was just a mess. The car is still in the garage more than we have it.
When we go to the dealer, it cost us about $1,300 every time we go, which is now becoming about once a month. We have now put more into repairs for the vehicle than we paid for it. I don't trust this car enough to have my children in it anymore. It is a death trap.

been nothing but pleased. The 3.8

provides acceptable gas milage for a 
car this size. I 
drive in New York City, and the ride is 
pretty smooth. I wish the Gran Touring 
suspension package was available in all 
Park Avenue models, but c'est la vie. 
Still, I would recommend this to 
anyone. Since Cadillac changed their 
body styles, I actually find the Park 
Avenue to look better. Finally, for 
under $40K, there is no other car that 
offers this much luxury. "

Excellent for the buyer (not for the seller - very low resale), which enabled me to purchase the car well under what it's worth in my eyes.  I have now owned it for a little over a year and its been fantastic.  Mine is fully optioned (I bought it in Hawaii and it has heated seats).

tires to different brand.  Still this 
vibration at highway speeds.  (Above 65

It's a shame that GM disc. the 6 cyl. 3800 series motor b/c now - Bertha might be replaced with a crossover and they don't have those motors anymore - only smaller V6's.

buick,park-avenue,2004,Bruce Wolf, 12/04/2015,"Solid comfort, cruiser deluxe",5,"Acquired this car nine years ago, and have been totally pleased ever since. Fits my tall frame well, and is so comfortable to drive, whether in town or on the Interstate, smooth riding, easy handling. Have even considered getting a second one, just to have available. Did put aluminum wheels on when the original chrome wheels began to peel a bit - that resulted in even better handling. Buick would be well advised to produce an anniversary edition in commemoration of the introduction of this model. The highway mileage is great for a luxury car of its vintage - get 30-32 mpg at Interstate speeds. Want to keep it forever.  My son wants it after that. My mechanic does too. Even fairly good gas mileage around town. Hit a deer while night driving on an Interstate, took front end damage, drove to the berm, was towed to a great body shop, and two fenders plus a hood and windshield later, it rides as well as ever. As it becomes more a vintage vehicle, the parts will become harder to get and more expensive, but not as much as a new car payment. Engine runs even smoother than before.

The Park Avenue I bought off second owner had 53K miles and was very clean. On the drive home I got a Stability System fault code and thought oh what did I buy. The previous owner told me three times it needed new tires so I bought four new Pirelli P7's and the Stability System fault code cleared. The new P7's transformed the ride character of the Buick. I recall engine RPM's of 2850 with a speed of 105 on the interstate with a four speed overdrive transmission. The RPM's were lower than my old S Class and 7 Series at that speed. MPG is unbelievable on the highway as I have seen over 33 MPG with the AC blowing and cruising at 77 MPH. The tensioner pulley coolant elbow are made of plastic, get them replaced with the metal ones. I plan on replacing the water pump, tensioner assembly, heater hoses, radiator hoses before I give it to my Dad. After changing the oil with Penzoil synthetic, transmission flush, K&N filter, and oh my the cabin air filters were a pain to replace, the Park Avenue drives like a Cadillac. I want a low mileage Ultra with the supercharger. I didn't know GM could make cars like this, unbelievable!

If you buy this car, you must get the Ultra with the supercharged engine, it is a rocket and flies effortlessly.

buick,park-avenue,2005,Steven D., 07/11/2018,Excellent Value As A Used Premium Vehicle,5,"My 2005 Buick Park Avenue has 35,000 miles on it, and I'm the second owner.  I've had the car for approximately 11 months, and it's proven a reliable and very comfortable vehicle, equal or greater then several luxury cars I've owned.  Acceleration is punchy, braking good, though handling is very floaty and steering lacks feedback.  Front and rear seats are equally comfortable, and with the bench seat I can comfortably carry 6 passengers to dinner or around down.  With 5 passengers it's common for all passengers to fall asleep - the car is quiet as a church mouse and very smooth, although the tires do allow for some poor feedback on rougher roads.  The interior and driving experience is very 90s American, comfortable, unapologetic, and almost lackadaisical.  Interior quality and ergonomics are adequate - if I place a loose object on the passenger seat while driving alone it will almost certainly fall between in the space between the top part of the seat and the bottom.  Cupholders are too few and too flimsy.  Technology is what you expect from a 2005 - no Bluetooth, navigation or active safety to speak of, but the steering wheel audio and cruise controls, AM/FM/CD/Cassette radio, dual power seats with memory, automatic headlights all make the driving experience easy.  Getting in and out is easy - I have a disabled family member who can get in from a wheelchair easily.  Reliability has been great - have replaced tires.  Value is excellent, there are a lot of good examples at much lower prices - it's really a comfortable, safe, spacious vehicle - the ride is as good as any luxury vehicle out there!  PROS: Ride quality, value, space, comfort, reliability, smooth power-train.  CONS:  Dated interior materials (even for 2005), ergonomics,  big car to park.  Highly recommended for its value and comfort, the 3.8 liter V6 is exceptionally smooth and reliable - I've had it in several vehicles with no issues.

We currently own a 1999 with 105K miles as well. Previously owned '85, '88 and '94 PA models.  All 5 have been the most reliable vehicles I have owned and the most comfortable car to drive.  Very good economy for a large car, consistantly 21 in town and 29 - 31 mpg on the interstate. The only major repair necessary on any of the 5 was a transmission service at 125K miles on the 1988.  None have ever used oil and the GM 3.8L V6 is bullet proof and very quiet. If looking at pre-owned, I highly recommend finding one with the touring package.

Mechanically, perfect--no warranty or

You feel every crack and hole in the road. Outside sounds! You hear it all. Acceleration! Forget it. You need to press down all the way on the gas pedal to get it to accelerate. Steering! To make this car make a sharp turn, forget it. A sharp U turn it cannot do. A sharp turn into a parking space, after 3 to 5 up and backs you can get in the parking space. This is not a Park Ave Ultra. This is a car that was thrown together and put out to sell. I still have my 99 Park Ave Ultra and I will take it over this one any day. I leased the 2005 for 3yr.

operational economy.  The only real 
negative is the rapid depreciation and 
this will continue to plague the Park 
Avenue as well as most other domestic 
vehicles.  Our service experience with 
the dealership has been excellent and 
we will probably continue to drive Park 
Avenues because for traveling and for 
storage capacity it has been a 
marvelous vehicle."

my opinion.  "
buick,rainier,2004,Gort, 03/08/2010,Best I've ever had,4,"I have owned a lot of vehicles and this is by far the best. Great performance, I feel like a King driving this. All the options you could ask for. Quite smooth ride. You just cannot beat this SUV. I stumbled upon it by accident and will never buy anything other than a Buick SUV again.  People need to stop complaining about the mpg. Its an SUV if you want better than 25 mpg get a geo metro. I get 15-16 in city and 18- 21 highway. So impressed I wish I could write more in this space.  Perfect SUV for a family looking for performance, reliability, safety, room, comfort, options, quite smooth ride, good looks inside and out, not to mention you will be driving something that not everyone else drives."
buick,rainier,2004,mannyr5653, 12/30/2013,Not your average College Student's Car!,4,"Being only 19, this isn't car most college guys have. Im the only one on campus with one of these! Ever since I bought my Rainier, It has been nothing but good to me. It has proved to be a reliable, luxurious, and all around great vehicle. Only repairs I've done are oil changes and new brake pads. This truck is extremely comfortable and surprisingly easy to drive. The V8 is very powerful, and can get up and go. Highway driving is awesome, the rear air suspension really makes the ride a million times better. The AWD is awesome when driving in snow and rain, it has kept me out of a lot of trouble. It really is a hit or miss with the rainier, either you get a good one or you get a lemon. "
buick,rainier,2004,tcharles, 05/29/2010,Air conditioning,3,The air conditioning just went on me.  It actually works but it will not blow out of the top vents.  It blows out of the bottom and through the defrost areas.   Was told by a dealer that it'll cost me over $3000 to repair it because of where the vent is located.  Has anyone else had this problem?
buick,rainier,2004,David Michaud, 10/12/2006,Buick Ranier,4,"I currently have about 70,000 miles on the SUV. My major expense was for replacement of blower motor for the AC system at 65,000 miles. At about 55,000 miles it was discovered the dip stick for checking the transmission fluid was corroded and fell off in the reservoir. This should have been covered by a warranty regardless of the miles. The paint for various buttons on the radio started wearing off showing the white undercoating."
buick,rainier,2004,shadav, 12/10/2011,Buick Rainer V-8,3,"I have owned several Buick's and this is by far the worst one I have owned.
The one I traded in had 143,000 miles on it and was still running perfectly.
With the Rainier, I began have trouble around 60,000 miles.
The instrument panel had to be replaced, then the air conditioner blew hot air on the passenger side.
Then it was the transfer case, then the air bags used in the suspension area began leaking.
At this very moment, it is parked in my garage with a broken water pump.
I haven't driven it in 4 months.
Instead, I bought a used vehicle that I paid cash for to get around town in.
It has been much more reliable than the Buick. "
buick,rainier,2004,rknack, 10/18/2013,Don't bother with this one...,1,"My Rainier is a piece of garbage. Parts are expensive, and labor even more so unless you are like me and do your own repairs - and even then, it is so poorly designed that it is a major undertaking to repair. As an example, the front differential blew up recently and I had to remove the steering rack, axles, AND the engine oil pan (the passenger side axle goes THROUGH the oil pan!) to remove it. Many of the bolts are difficult to get at. It would have cost me $2500 in labor alone to have a shop repair it for me, plus parts cost. I will NEVER willingly own another vehicle in this series again, and if I could afford to buy another vehicle I would. At least it's fully paid for..."
buick,rainier,2004,LOVE MY BUICK, 05/16/2009,LOVE MY BUICK,4,"Absolutely love my Rainier!  I tow a 5,000 pound camper every summer with no effort and no problem.  The only thing I dislike is the heat system. Can't figure it out! Love everything else about it. Will be disappointed when have to replace and cannot buy another. Mine is loaded with every imaginable extra. Have read the owners manual more than ever in any other vehicle!  Would recommend this vehicle highly."
buick,rainier,2004,Tony1234, 02/22/2010,Bitter Sweet,3,"This 2004 AWD Rainier has major ongoing issues. Starting at 80,000 miles its one repair after another. I love the features, style and ride. I don't tow, off road or plow. I just drive like any normal person. All scheduled normal lube maintenance has been practiced as recommended by manufacture manual yet the AWD never seems to work. I replaced the transfer case, transmission, front differential, axles, 4 decoder motors, wiring harness and 2 front wheel sensors($9,000+)and the front wheels still don't work. This whole vehicle should have been recalled in my opinion.  Oh! The speedometer is brke"
buick,rainier,2004,Joseph, 01/12/2007,Wouldn't You rather drive a buick!,4,"I purchased my Rainier 12/06. Have driven it about 600 miles so far. Love it! I wish I had gotten it alot sooner. I have driven, and was willing to buy the new '06 Explorer, but after driving it and deciding it wasn't all what they said, I decided to try a Pathfinder. Too expensive. So I decided to try a TrailBlazer, Envoy and such. Drove the Buick and was sold! I love the power, quietness, options and such. Explorer comes with one power-point, where Buick has three. Also if you go to U-haul they won't rent you a trailer if you have a Explorer. Enough said about the tranny."
buick,rainier,2004,DC-in-MD, 06/13/2017,2004 Buick Rainier 5.3 V8 - Great Car,4,"** Update - RIP - at 255000 miles.   Well Rainier finely made his last trip. at over 255000 miles it still had the original engine and transmission.  Never had to touch them.  But keeping it on the road just get to be too expensive.  Not that it needed any major repairs, but the repairs it needed were expensive.  Like Motor mounts... a new fuel pump, valve cover gaskets, and a main seal.  The cost of repairs was just more than the car was worth.   SAD because she still ran well and everything worked as it should.  so RIP old friend I purchased my Rainier back in 2007 with 40K miles on it.  It was a Dealer certified used car.  I have put nearly 200,000 miles on it to date and other than a few issues I have to say its one of the best cars I have ever owned.  Other than normal maintenance items, unexpected repairs were a catalytic converter at just over 100,000 miles (thanks Baltimore for all the potholes) and a failed A/C compressor clutch mechanism.   The compressor was working great but the clutch would stop working after about 20 minutes of driving.  Other than those 2 unexpected repairs I have only had to do normal maintenance items and repairs for wear and tear.  That's to be expected on a car with over 200K miles.  ** Likes**  Comfortable, quiet and handles like it's on rails.  Lots of power and the AWD will not leave you stuck in the snow.  **dislikes**  wish it had more headroom for the driver.  At 6'2"" my head is almost touching the ceiling.  Wish it also had a manual AWD lockup switch.   **Final thoughts**  It's a great car, fun to drive and for a V8 AWD SUV I get an average combined MPG of about 17 commuting in Washington beltway traffic which I do not think is bad.   One last comment:  After 13years of salt and winter driving the car has No RUST. Paint still shines and the body is in great shape, other than a number of rock chips on the hood.  Well made car :-)  Would definitely buy it again if I could.  In fact, I am keeping an eye out for a lower mileage one now.  The V8's are hard to find.

buick,rainier,2004,LAUGH1969, 08/31/2003,What an amazing vehicle!!,5,"I narrowed my search down to the 
GMC Envoy SLT, and the Rainier.  I 
decided to go with the Rainier, and I 
am so glad I did.  It is so much more 
luxurious, comfortable, classier, and 
sooooo much quieter then the Envoy.  
Buick did an outstanding job, I would 
recommend anybody that is in the market 
for a ""Refined Utility Vehicle"", as 
Buick calls it, to defiently look at 
the Rainier.  My wife owns a Buick 
Rendezvous, both of Buicks trucks are 
so much nicer then the competition.  To 
me, and to others who drive it, will 
see how it is a smaller, five passenger 
version of a Cadillac Escalade."
buick,rainier,2004,brassones, 07/30/2011,More Electrical Problems,2,"My Rainer has had soo many electrical
problems. 
1. No speedometer for over 2 yrs
2. No gas gauge for 1 yr
3. The ambient temp sensor was knocked loose because the water pump dislodged it causing the A/C to quit working. So its 100 degrees outside and the rad out says its -14. Cost me $600 to repair
4. And not to mention every once in a while when you hit a bump wrong at night, the headlights will just quit. And I have checked connections. 

Anyone else have ideas or comments."

I live about 50mins. from prattville.Anyway, halfway there my truck caught on fire from behind,which I was unaware of until I heard a noise like a blown out tire. To my surprise,when I got out with my teenager daughter and a set of twins; the rear of the truck was on fire.By te time I picked up the kids and ran, the entire rainier was engulfed in flames.The fire was so intense it consumed the entire under carrage,air stablizer,the complete motor,the stepping bar,and two tires, it could have exploxed"

I needed to get an up to date buick I had a 93 lesabre, the air went last summer. Thats when I knew it was time to get a new car, or a new used one. Thats when I did my research, I wanted a car buick but when I seen the rainier I said thats what I want. Guess what I hav I got it too.The only problem I had was with the CD Player. I hav to get a new radio in there any way. My CD's got stuck in them. I am just going to get one put in there myself. Otherwise the vechicle is okay. I had a recnt problem with the AWD, but the dealership where I went to go buy it from fixed, it was still under warranty. That was a plus."

The Buick has all the room and comfort you expect from a Buick, and at 6'2"", I have plenty of leg room. As far as some people complained about fuel mileage, I am getting 18mpg around town, and get 28mpg on the highway and I don't drive like the proverbial Little Old Lady just because I'm handicaped."

like a dream. Quiet, comfortable and 
full of exhileration - even with the 
275 HP 6 cylinder engine. This engine 
stands right up there with the V8s. The 
Buick name tag is a plus (at least to 
us). We had a 1985 Riviera (One of my 
favorite cars) and a 1988 Skyhawk 
(which we had bought for our daughter). 
Both were great cars and we expect the 
Ranier to be even better."

The drive train, the driver side seat, and major problems with the four wheel drive mechanism. I am very luckly that I purchased the extended warranty. I would not recommend purchasing this SUV. Just recently one dealship that I brought it to because it was making a very loud banging noise said, ""You must have purchased a Friday afternoon car,"" after they saw the long list of things that I have already had to fix. Basically agreeing that there are and has been some major problems with my SUV. Buyer beware. I would not recommend this SUV"

Also V8 is a major plus for this vehicle. I have noted that AWD seems to engage in reverse as noted by one of your participants which will require watching.
buick,rainier,2004,candygurl, 06/08/2008,Great!,4,I really like this SUV. I have been in many SUVs and own a Suburban. I really like the room for me and my 4 kids and the drive is nice and safe.

Rides great - exceptionally smooth but 
not too soft - still has good cornering 
ability for an SUV.
Without the rebates the car cannot 
compete well against imports mainly 
because of the interior design. 
Otherwise performance is at a par if 
not better. It has been a surprise to 
get only 15-16mpg in mixed suburb/hwy

will get better."

buick,rainier,2004,IfIcouldfly, 06/27/2006,Seatbelt,3,I think GM has finally achieved a seatbelt that is uncomfortable for every body type.  The front belts come from the seat and cut into the neck of tall or large people and hit smaller people in the face.   So you can get the the seat belt extension for free that enables you to move it around more however then the belt does not not lock in place making the safety value questionable.

worthy addition to the GM line that 
provides a great balance between 
pampering and practicality.  This is 
the third vehicle I've owned with an in-
line six.  Why aren't they available in

Our report is we enjoyed the ride and comfort, we did not get tired though some days included lots of miles.  Lots of Christmas presents, golf clubs, luggage were stored well with back seat down.  Window tinting makes it difficult to see cargo area contents, providing some sense of security. Very windy days produced excessive noise around the passenger front window.

buick,rainier,2004,C. Jones, 07/06/2005,An Excellent Choice,4,"I have been very surprised at the performance of this vehicle.  No return visits to fix problems, and it just is excellent to have.  Quiet, comfortable, handles good, with better than expected gas mileage.  I bought it 3 months ago and went across the states from south to north and then from east to west coast.  I really love it.  Has the goodies on it, but they came standard, not at added expense.  I had a Mercury  Grand Marquis before and this vehicle lives up to the comfort and ease of driving that the Mercury has, besides having the luxury items that a Mercury spoils you with.  They are hard to find, but well worth the trouble and time spent."
buick,rainier,2004,nrund, 12/23/2003,Buick Rainier - rock solid!,4,"After researching all the luxury 
midsized SUV's I narrowed the list to; 
Lexus RX330, Toyota Highlander and 
4Runner Limiteds, Infiniti FX35 and 
Buick Rainier. I test drove all five 
again. The FX35 felt like a 
fancy station wagon. The 4Runner was a 
disappointment as it rattled and 
lacked the quality Toyota is known 
for. The Highlander reminded me of the 
RX300 I was replacing, the dull 
exterior and price didnt warrant 
serious consideration. Only the RX330 
and Rainier remained. Both are 
comfortable, luxuriously appointed and 
well constructed. Rainers rock 
solid construction, luxury amenities 
and GMs financing make the Rainier a 
true value."
buick,rainier,2004,palex, 12/23/2003,Getting acquainted,3,"Previously had a van so there is an 
adjustment going on.  The ride is 
excellent as well is the handling.  Had 
running boards installed but they still 
do not give much of a platform to enter 
or exit vehicle on.  The rear door is 
very restrictive for getting in or 
out.  Wind noise is more then I 
expecdted at highway speeds.  Fuel 
economy is only about 13.8 in town.  
Have not been on the road yet.  Rear 
seart belts are difficult to connect 
because of a very short anchor strap.  
Rear seat heater is o.k. at low speeds 
but makes too much noise if it is turn 
up.  Brakes feel somewhat spondgy right 
now..will have to have the dealer chect 
them.  "
buick,rainier,2004,Mahleen, 12/24/2003,Buick Rainier - a pleasant surprise,4,"I researched all the luxury midsize 
SUV's I narrowed my list to RX330, 
Highlander and 4Runner Limited, FX35 
and the Buick Rainier. The FX35 felt 
like a station wagon, the interior is 
cramped. The 4Runner rattled and 
lacked the quality Toyotas are known 
for. The Highlander exterior design is 
dull and price is high. Down to two; 
the RX330 is comfortable, luxuriously 
appointed and well constructed. To my 
surprise, the Rainer matched the RX330 
in each category except the interior 
is not as luxurious BUT the Rainier 
outclassed the RX330 with its rock 
solid feel. Rainers solid 
construction, amenities and GMs 
financing make it a true value."
buick,rainier,2004,James Jenkins, 09/22/2005,Long Rides Enjoyable,4,"I travel a lot. I have found the Rainier a pleasure to drive for hours at a time. My partner also shares in the driving and I sleep quite comfortably in the reclining passenger seat, although I would prefer the seats to have a little more of a bucket-seat form to provide a more settled feel into the seat. Overall, this ride feels and handles more like my older Buick Park Avenue than an SUV. I luv it, just what I was looking for!"
buick,rainier,2004,vnique, 01/10/2004,One Great SUV,5,"This is a great SUV that gives a great 
ride that is quiet.  The seats are 
very comfortable, especially with the

not disappointed me"
buick,rainier,2004,Marzetta Thompson, 01/13/2004,Buick 4X4,4,"I looked for months before buying.  I 
tried (road tested) every luxury SUV on 
the market.  Some were to big, some 
were to small, some had to hard of a 
ride and I really stumbled across the 
new Buick Rainer.  It has a wonderful 
ride, lots of creature comforts like 
heated seats.  I like the pep, the 
smooth ride.  Best vehicle I have ever 
had."
buick,rainier,2004,Claude Sparks, 01/13/2004,2004 Buick Rainier CXL Plus AWD,4,"Great smaller SUV.  Easy to handle, 
fits nicely in garage, very 
comfortable, and the new insulated 
glass is a big plus in reducing outside 
noise. We also own a Denali and it's 
comparable just on a smaller scale.
  "
buick,rainier,2004,Joe Kurzweil, 01/15/2004,Rainier for Seniors,4,"Mid size suv is ideal for comfort and 
performance.  Very nice to drive.  I 
weigh 235 and am very comftorable in 
this suv.  My wife is 100 lbs less and 
is very comftorable as well. X band 
Bose sound is awesome.  Would like to 
have seen a bit more contemporary 
design inside but it is nice as is.  
Side air bags are not standard and 
should be along with curtain air bags.  
However we feel very safe in this 
vehicle.  Six cyliner has plenty of get 
up and mileage on the road is between 
21.5 and 22.5 mpg at 65 mph.  "
buick,rainier,2004,Larry Myers, 01/18/2004,Rainier Our Monaco SUV,4,"This is a very comfortable vehicle for 
the driver and front seat passanger. It 
has an amazing amount of standard 
featues and is a real pleasure to 
drive. It handles very well in snow and 
icy conditions. It moves with ease and 
feels very stable on the road, even in 
high wind conditions."

buick,rainier,2004,Golfer, 01/14/2004,Buick Rainier 8 cyc.,4,"I just bought the 8 cylinder Rainier
with satellite radio, navigation system,
and sun roof.  The 5.7 engine has plenty
of pick up, more than most people will
need.  The handling and quiet ride is
better than any suv I have driven.  My
other choice was the Cadillac SRX.  It
is less money, quieter, and I could not
even get 2 sets of golf clubs in the
SRX.  There is no comparison in value
and ride.  Buy the Rainier."
buick,rainier,2004,Dr d, 12/27/2005,"Fun,Safe and Dependable",5,"This Buick Is a very stable platform . Fun to drive due to great handling for us , the average driver. Speed and acceleration that makes you feel young when you need it, entering a freeway or getting out of a jam. Sometimes, just showing off. It just feels good to know that you're in command of the road on occasion. Plenty of room for passengers & Luggage. Easily maneuvers in any grocery store parking lot and brings the bacon home safley. Might keep this for 20 years."
buick,rainier,2004,Ronak, 01/30/2004,The Best Buick Yet,5,"This car/SUV should really give the 
imports a run for their money. We 
looked at a LexusRX330 and a Toyota 
Highlander aling with the Buick 
Rainier. The overall refinement 
including its off-road manners really 
convinced us to buy the Buick. General 
Motors is getting it right with a lot 
of neat, high quality products. Watch 
out Lexus and Toyota!"
buick,rainier,2004,mapwsenn, 02/07/2004,Why Don't I See More of Them?,4,"   I have the 8 cylinder. My previous 
car was a luxury European model, and I 
don't miss it all. Great pickup when I 
need it on the turnpike. Quiet with 
very little outside noise. It is hard 
for me to understand why I am not 
seeing them on the highways."

buick,rainier,2004,cobradriver, 02/10/2004,Buick Ranier,3,"Ride is excellent for and SUV. Very 
quiet, much quieter than wife's 
Acura.  Passed on the V8 as 
performance is quite good, V8 only 
adds 15 HP but more torque.  Build 
quality was very good, as are 
materials.  Terrific seats, and audio 
system."
buick,rainier,2004,Larry Yoder, 02/13/2004,Larry's Review of Buick Rainier,4,"Purchased my Rainier after close 
consideration of many other brands of 
SUV's. I felt the Rainier was far and 
away the best value for the price. 
After driving the Rainier to Florida 
from Ohio I was not disappointed with 
my choice. The car handled beautifully
, there was virtually no road noise, 
the ride and comfort was excellent, the 
interior design and features are 
excellent, the car has an overall solid 
feel. 

I am a little disappointed in the fuel 
mileage. I figure it cost me an extra 
$20.00 for my trip to Fl. but, 
considering the comfort and features of 
the Rainier I can easily live with the 
mileage."
buick,rainier,2004,sxc, 02/17/2004,my rainer,4,"rides and handles like a car rather than
a truck.  Nice pick up. Driver
information center could use more data.
It was an excellent choice at a good price."
buick,rainier,2004,GJH, 02/17/2004,LeSabre was great. So is the Rainier,4,"My 1988 LeSabre T Type was a fabulous 
car, and I hated to trade it in.  But, 
it was time.  A lot has changed in 16 
years, and the Rainier has more gadgets 
and toys than I really need but I like 
them.  Engine and transmission are very 
powerful and smooth.  Handling is 
extremely agile.  Braking performance 
is top notch.  I traded a great 
performing vehicle for a new great 
performing vehicle.  The interior and 
exterior styling are easy on the eyes, 
and very functional."
buick,rainier,2004,Hopey, 02/23/2004,My Rainer,5,"This vehicle is awesome. I could not be 
happier. Its fun to drive and 
comfortable on longer trips. I also 
have a '97 Lesabre that is still going 
strong. I got rid of an Expedition for 
this Buick Rainer and would do it again 
in a heartbeat. "
buick,rainier,2004,pirtfest, 02/25/2004,Girly Chic!,4,"As a very feminine woman, it surprises 
me that I chose a Rainier.  I had been 
looking at the Cadillac CTS and test 
drove the Rainier.  I was hooked 
immediately.  It rides like a sedan, 
it's easy to get things in and out of 
the rear hatch, and folding down the 
seats is easy.  Gary Bibb at Dutton 
Motor Company in Riverside, CA did me a 
real favor by showing me this vehicle."
buick,rainier,2004,yukon, 02/26/2004,Nothing beats a V8!!,4,"I drove the 6 cyl and then the 8 cyl 
back to back on test drives.  WOW!  
What a difference.  The V8 only gives 
you 15 more HP and 50 lbs/ft torque but 
it drives like a whole different 
vehicle.  I needed the V8 to tow our 
5200 lb travel trailer and it does well 
towing it.(with Weight Dist. Hitch)  
The Rainer does it as well as the 
Silverado I traded in."
buick,rainier,2004,dratnol, 02/29/2004,A great choice!,5,"Having owned a Lexus with major
reliability problems, I purchased this
Buick last November.  My job keeps me on
the road a lot and this vechile has been
great so far.  It is very comfortable,
handles very well, and is a high quality
truck.  The interior fit and finish is
great and the exterior has uniform gaps
amonst body panels.  This vechile is
extremely quiet and I have been very
pleased with this choice."
buick,rainier,2004,Carroll, 02/29/2004,A Great Vehicle for Two-Driver Household,4,"Has a lot of performance and features 
for $31k. V-8 has tremendous mid-range 
torque and highway passing ability. 
Interior finish acceptable for American 
vehicle. Two person instant memory on 
seats, pedals, mirrors, etc.,  etc., 
allows you to get a good driving 
position without compromise. XM digital 
radio is even great around town (no 
interruptions). Bose works well for 
adult sounds (jazz, vocals, classical). 
Quiet and comfortable ride for 4-5 
people. Handling is o.k. for full 
framed mid-sized SUV."
buick,rainier,2004,Tami17a, 03/02/2004,Love it!,4,"My first SUV.  Love everything about

buick,rainier,2004,oaa9898, 03/05/2004,An All New Buick?,3,"This may be an all-new Buick, but its really 
just a rebaged GMC Envoy.  The interior 
plastics are too low rent for this class, 
materials in the Lexus are much better.  The 
car has been in the shop 3 times in two 
months, so much for reliability.  The IIHS 
(Insurance Institute for Highway Safety) 
SAFETY ratings are also VERY LOW, so much 
for the ""solid as a rock"" feeling that one 
reviewer described.  Don't fall for the 
marketing hype, it may look pretty, but the 
quality, and more importantly the safety, is 
not up to par with the competition.  Another 
thing to consider is the price, given the 
expected resale value of this SUV, it is 
overpriced."

seats are firm yet comfortable. "
buick,rainier,2004,TrainDR, 03/08/2004,Thoroughly Researched,4,"Pulled ahead in lease program from 02 
Rendezvous. Looked at Infinity G45, 
Lexus RX330, VolvoXJ90,Nissan 
Murano,Dodge Magnum Wagon,GMC Yukon 
and Chevy Tahoe Z71. One test drive 
says it all. Smooth operator-heated 
seat backs is a nice plus--but when 
Tahoe has 290 horse, why spend up to 
five thousand more to feel like you 
are driving a truck. Rainier handles 
better, feels and looks like a 
Cadillac, sitting up higher yet 
feeling stable and secure in heavier 
truck. Good combination of engine 
choice and transmission.We are so 
impressed with Buick's new addition 
and are very satisfied with it."

to Rendezvous."
buick,rainier,2004,ssanders, 03/16/2004,Instant Love,4,"My eyes were drawn to the body style,

buick,rainier,2004,Simon Belmont, 03/19/2004,Ranier vs. Lexus 330,4,"Comparable or better to Lexus RX330 in 
quiet ride (we have both vehicles) in 
our family.  Solid feel when driving 
due to body on frame design - much more 
so than Lexus RX330 with unibody 
construction. Interior is somewhat 
sparse compared to Lexus RX330 and 
doesn't feel as open as Lexus, but has 
very good leg room. Could use more 
interior storage areas. Better value 
than RX330 when considering that GM 
Dealers will discount $3,000 to $5,000 
off of window price with incentives 
etc. Good lease vehicle through GMAC."
buick,rainier,2004,Driver770, 03/30/2004,Quiet but Average SUV,3,"Needs more refinement to compete in 
class.  Incentives make this vehicle 
worth what you finally pay for it.  
Noise levels are low, except for wind 
noise at speeds greater than 60 mph.  
Fit and finish are below standards.  
Gaps where bumper plastic meets fender 
is very visible.  Base six cylinder 
engine is great - smooth, refined, and 
plenty of power.  Gas mileage is less 
than advertised.  Resonant noises, only 
at certain speeds, create a booming 
rumble that is very annoying.  Already 
have a few rattles.  Overall, a good 
touring vehicle that does not offend.  
Just don't drive it too hard, and don't 
expect more than it costs."
buick,rainier,2004,Bob Klem, 03/30/2004,Its a good ride,3,"First there aren't many around 
yet,which means not many after market

an over abundance like the Explorer or 
Jeep."
buick,rainier,2004,crash1, 03/30/2004,Not my fathers buick,4,"My Rainer with AWD is about the most 
stable 'truck' I have ever owned.  It's 
road manners are excellent, and I was 
suprised at the sure footedness when I 
took it off road. I was sure I was 
making a compromise in buying the Buick 
version of the TrailBlazer, but the AWD 
changed my thinking fast. I took it on 
muddy tracks that other 4X4's were 
having trouble with, the AWD just stuck 
to the path and never bogged down 
once.  
Like I said before, its a very stable 
vehicle on city streets, highways, and 
cow paths."

this is also a good choice.   "
buick,rainier,2004,grs48a, 04/13/2004,Crimson Pearls,4,"A lot of power in the 6. The small 
turning radius was a real surprise, 
making it very maneuverable. The combo 
can make it very tippable. Great 
looking and very quiet inside. Gas 
mileage goes down quickly above 60 mph 
and in stop and go driving - currently 
averaging about 19.0 mpg. Love the 
leather seats. It's taller, but not as 
wide or as long as my old vehicle."

we glad we did!  It has a way smoother ride, 
better looking interior controls and features, 
and a sleeker exterior.  This is my first SUV

hundreds of dollars into this lemon, I 
was finally forced to trade it in.  I 
purchased a Yukon Denali and found 
that although it is a beautiful and 
awesome vehicle, it is too large for 
every day driving. My Rainier is the 
perfect additional vehicle for my 
household. It has the look of my 
Bravada and the ride and features of 
my Denali.  I strongly recommend this 
vehicle for anyone looking for any 
type of mid-size SUV. Look beyond the 
Envoy - you get so much more for the 
money in the Rainier!"

Quality, Fit, Finish is excellent and I 
have the 6cyl which is getting @18 mpg

previous Explorers and Mountaineers

many ways. The smooth ride, fun to 
drive and high engine performance are 
there. The ability to look out from any 
angle is amazing. The amount of room to 
transport people or put the seats down 
and haul items is very nice feature. 
The ability for each individual to have 
their  own temperature control is a 
very smart idea. I still am in awe when 
I drive the Rainier for the quality and 
the price! Great job Buick!!!11"

the Toyota was 11 years old and by 
keeping the 7 year old Tahoe in 
excellent condition and new tires, I 
had the best of both.  For the kind of 
everyday errands and general getting 
about the Rainier gave me the fun of a

a SUV. However, the minute I took it 
for a test drive, I knew I was hooked!!!"

is a little slopy but it is extrenely
soft. Average 17 miles to gallon around
town and thays with the v8."
buick,rainier,2004,Reeseboy, 06/29/2004,Excellent SUV!! Thank You Buick!!,4,"I have owned my Buick Ranier for about 
two months now and I simply love it!!  
It gives you somewhat the feeling that 
you do own a truck in city driving; but 
yet extremely comfortable and easy to 
handle. On the interstate; quite 
honestly, I can compare it's handling 
and comfort to my 03 Cadillac Deville. 
The Ranier is such a joy to drive!!"
buick,rainier,2004,rxrad1, 07/07/2004,Well Done,4,"My Ranier in GM's Crimson Red definitely
turns some heads. It's  V8 is quick and
the vehicle is extremely quiet... all
while getting the same MPG as my  6 cyl
Grand Cherokee. With XM Radio, Onstar,
Leather and Auto everything... I love MY
car!!"
buick,rainier,2004,goodguynva, 07/10/2004,Buick,4,"The vehicle is much more quiet than its 
brother and siste GM mid size SUV's. 
The technology is full blown and could 
be somewhat confusing to anyone not 
used to pushing buttons without word 
descriptions above them. I would rate 
the ride as above average but if youre 
looking for a really smooth ride, you 
may want to move up to a full size SUV. 
(GM product of course!)"
buick,rainier,2004,rmnord, 07/10/2004,EXCELLENT,5,"Wife's car and she loves it.  She had a 
2002 Bravada and really liked it , but 
the Rainier much better.  The V/8 is 
much better than the 6 cylinder, the 
ride is smoother and it is quieter. It 
is just a richer looking vehicle."

buick,rainier,2004,Dr Tom D, 07/11/2004,A Great Little SUV.,4,"Fun SUV to drive Small 
footprint,extremly quick and agile with 
the V-8. Quiet and easy to drive on 
rough and smooth surface. Psycologicly 
it ""fits"".The valets fight to drive it. 
It even pulls an 18 foot Four Winns 
Boat or a trailer full of trash.It Gets 
you up out of the water. Now thats 
important when you live in Texas. 
Recently we've had Gully washers at 
least once a week."
buick,rainier,2004,Irby Jones, 07/10/2004,Nice Car,4,"What we like the most: comfort on 
trips, heats up interior instantly in 
the winter, running board for easy 
access.  Overall a nice car.  Limited 
room in floor of front seat, no visor 
extensions and speed control acts up 
when in hills, starts jumping going 
down hills.  No help from GM in a fix 
so far.  Like the car better than the 
rendevous which we previously owned but 
has less room and storage than the 
rendevous."
buick,rainier,2004,Wdyer, 07/16/2004,Buick Value,4,"Overall this is a great value with the 
current rebates. Surprised about a few 
things though. No hydraulic lift for 
the hood?  Even Rendexvous has this. 
Too much plastic. Faux wood. Unexciting 
instrument panel.  Poor range of low 
beam headlights. WOW! What a quiet 
vehicle and great ride!"
buick,rainier,2004,MHBACH, 07/23/2004,Rainier a good choice,4,"I test drove the other intermediate

I miss is the mileage per gallon. "
buick,rainier,2004,NancyW, 09/01/2004,Rainier Rules!,4,"Everything from the buying process to 
the trips and commuting I do in my 
Rainier has been a pleasure.  The car 
itself is beautiful - a dark green with 
lots of chrome highlights.  Everything 
is automatic, from the seat positions 
to lights turning on.  It rides 
smoothly and quietly, but without that 
floating feeling that can make luxury 
cars less handleable.  We've already 
had to call on the services of OnStar 
when the family was locked out of the 
car while on vacation - they came 
through with flying colors and got us 
back in the car within five minutes."

features are excellent.  I love the 
dual function heated seats and the in-
dash 6 CD changer with XM radio.  The 
sound system is incredible.  Everybody 
that sees this SUV loves it.  I get 
compliments on it all the time.  I am 
planning on getting another one when 
this lease expires.  I highly recommend 
it!!!"
buick,rainier,2004,New Oreans Buyer, 10/18/2004,Buick Hits Home Run,4,"VERY smooth and quite ride.  Handles 
well    Agree with current owner, it 
could use more storage.
Cross bars for roof rack should be 
standard.  This seems a little cheap 
on Buick's part for a car in this 
price range. Same with front seat side 
air bags. Would love for it to have 
had the  Buick famous icon (the three 
holes on the front quarter panels).  
This would have been the icing on the 
cake for exterior.
Too new for reliability opinion.  Only 
one defect at delivery.  The console 
lock would not hold down the cover 
whne bumped. New lock clip was ordered."

something smaller, this is perfect."
buick,rainier,2004,dedapr, 12/22/2004,Rainier,4,"Very responsive and fun to drive. The 
V8 gives enough power. "
buick,rainier,2004,Andrew, 02/07/2005,We love it,5,We bought the car as a refined long distance transport and we are not disappointed. It (V8) has all the power we need when we want it. It is quiet enough to appreciate the Bose sound and the wonderful XM radio system. We paid a little more and opted for the small upgrades on the 2005 model. The test car was parked on a hill lot with the lot rim just in front of forward wheels in a foot of frozen snow. I had to apply a fair amount of power to overcome those conditions. You could feel the AWD come in and the rear didn't move an inch sideways as I hauled it up and out. Right there we decided that we didn't need another 4X4 to address our daily needs this car was perfect for us... so far.
buick,rainier,2004,rainer owner, 06/22/2005,Surprisingly Good,3,"This is my first GM product in many, many years. With 13,000 miles on the odometer, the vehicle has been completely reliable. The only visits to the dealer have been for oil changes. It rides very well and is extremely quiet, much better than a Pathfinder that I owned in the past. I am pleasantly suprised. "
buick,rainier,2005,Pat, 09/07/2006,2005 Rainier,4,"I have had no problems with the car so far. It's very reliable. The ride is very comfortable. It feels like you are driving a car, but you're just sitting higher up."
buick,rainier,2005,Hannah DeLisle, 11/16/2005,Great SUV,4,"W have been very happy with this vehicle, one of the best we have had. We took it to Florida and back to Micigan and it was great.  I have only had to change the oil two times in over a year.  "

buick,rainier,2005,Jennifer, 02/04/2008,Love it!,4,I have been reading about this model for over a year. I was so happy to find a 2005 w/only 1 owner. It also had low miles and looked brand new! Now lets talk about the ride. Love it! It handles well and it is heavy for a short SUV and I feel safe in it. 
buick,rainier,2005,Randy Bloem, 04/21/2007,Most Underated SUV,4,"I test drove many of the SUV's including the new Ford Edge. The Buick Rainier beats them all in ride, comfort, and style. This has to be the most under-rated vehicle in its class. A tremendous used car value."

buick,rainier,2005,Lou Kirk, 01/03/2006,Review of 2005 Buick Rainier,4,"This is my first SUV and I couldn't be happier with it. Comfort, driveablity, power, MPG could be a little better, easy to park, visibility to see other traffic on the road is exceptional, maintaince is easy, OnStar makes me feel very secure.  I have driven this vehicle from the mid United states to the east coast and then to the west coast and back to the midwest and not one problem.  Would like to see keyless entry on the next one that I get."
buick,rainier,2005,Theo, 11/08/2006,Excellent SUV,4,"Driving this SUV is fun. Handling is supurb. The quiet inside is next to none, that is outside noise is near ""0"" except for very loud noises. The layout inside makes everything easy to get to. Sight line to instruments is very good. Comfort in all seats is very good and there is enough leg room in the rear for a six foot plus person. Cargo space is good. The wheel well splash guards should be put on as a standard feature and not an option. This vehicle has been built with the persnickety driver in mind. Thanks for doing such a good job on this SUV. I often forget that I am driving an SUV because it feels so much like a car. Great job!"
buick,rainier,2005,Dawana Faye Daniel, 02/20/2016,Love my Rainier,5,"Before my Rainier I owned and was only driver of a 1995 extended top Chevy Conversion Van.  I loved my Van.  It was my Motor Home.  When I moved I finally had a garage, was getting a little old to crawl up to scrap off the Snow and ice,  it would not fit into the Garage and it was needing some work.  I had to have one I could see out & above the instrument panel.  As soon as I saw my University Of Ky Blue SUV I oh so wanted it to be the one.  I was so tired of searching.  I sat down in that driver's seat and was sold.  The Carmax did not give it a good report on gas mileage.  I was getting to the age that this was not a problem.
For the amount I have paid for extra fuel  compared for what some of my friends have in repair, I have the best deal.  I travel some with 2 dogs and so cargo is plentiful.  It rides like a car and is great in the snow if I have to drive.  It may well be my last vehicle. Because they no longer make the Rainier.  It gets the best care possible.  My son, his wife and my daughter, her husband own Enclaves.  Even the step down from Enclave does not fit this 4'10"" 78 year old Great Grandmom.n

buick,rainier,2005,pensketech1, 09/16/2013,Money Pit,2,"I am the second owner of my Rainier. At 65000 miles, I had to replace my engine due to a cracked head (coolant got in the oil and wiped out my bearings). I am experiencing turning problems at low speeds and now my security light comes on and vehicle will not start. My GM rep. told me I was out of luck when the engine blew, and the repair costed me over $4000 to do myself. GM needs to actually stand behind their vehicles. I have owned GM vehicles all of my life and am no where near satisfied with this one."
buick,rainier,2005,BNA1JJS, 04/19/2008,Lemon,2,"I am very concerned with this vehicle. Decided to take a leap into a GMC product in 2005 and made a very costly mistake. Here is a list of the problems I have had with my Buick: Heat shield on manifold loose, fuel sensor bad replaced, steering rack asembly bad replaced, reset toe, misc squeeking front still can't find, wornout idler pully replaced, water pump replaced, rear window fluid sprayer still leaking, rear hatch shocks to weak to hold hatch up still."

Buick sends a notice to finally to cover 1/2 the repair cost. Too late.
Driver's side door handle. Broken twice. Part is engineered to fail. $127 to buy $4 of plastic

buick,rainier,2005,Adrian Clark, 06/02/2005,Better than Lexus,5,"A great vehicle. After experiencing the Lexus RS300, this vehicle is far superior in all aspects. The Rainier is more roomy, more solid, more fun to ride and has a much more comfortable ride than the Lexus. The Rainier is quieter and the quality is superior. "
buick,rainier,2005,i loar, 07/10/2005,My wifes Rainier,2,"This one is thirsty, getting only 17 mpg city  and 18.5 highway. it has too much body roll.  The engine seems to be working too hard at interstate speed.  It's missing some features of a LeSabre and is not enough vehicle for the money.  I really expected more from a Buick.  It's not as quiet as advertised."
buick,rainier,2005,Jay, 08/14/2005,Excellent SUV,4,"We have owned the vehicle since June 05 after owning a 1990 Toyota 4 Runner. The Rainier is such a wonderful ride and very quiet. It is easy to get in and out of and with all of the standard options included, it was a no brainer. On the highway, set your cruise or before you know it, you will be over 80 mph. Mileage is 20 highway and 15 city. Leg room is plenty, both front and back seats.  The Bose audio system is outstanding.  The front drink holders need to be redesigned as to location, but overall, we love this vehicle."
buick,rainier,2005,howdydooit, 06/05/2006,"Works for me -tailgates, trips, runabout",4,"12 months old - replaced an aging minivan & sedan.  That said, we needed a vehicle for tailgating and trips. It holds all our gear (flag pole, folding table, chairs, grill, cooler, etc & 2 or 3 people, depending on how judiciously we pack - we can get away with only folding down one back seat).  The sound system is awesome, the climate controls are individualized (plus rear controls for climate/audio), and it's extemely quiet and smooth.  Fuel economy is 22 - 23 hwy, 15-18 around town."

buick,rainier,2005,Char, 02/05/2005,Only One thing wrong,4,"I had a Buick Rendevous for two years before this Rainer so I know my Buick SUV's.  They are very reliable and unique SUVs.  Why? They have fantastic rear space for carrying many different sized items. I have been in the higher end SUVs and they were not made to carry anything at all. I have really liked both of these Buick models and the only thing I would like to see is the front seat room of the Rendevous put in the Rainer. That is the only thing I would want changed.  The ride is outstanding and winter driving almost fun.  Don't hesitate to buy these two models, they are the best in the U.S. SUV lines...."
buick,rainier,2005,Ed Kildoyle, 04/23/2005,Had to buy 2 of them,3,I bought one for myself and my wife liked it so much she wanted one of her own so we now own two of them. We both love our Rainiers as they give us the luxury comforts and the features of a mid sized SUV. They are very quiet with a comfortable ride especially on long trips. I have the V8 so the pickup is very good and unless you take turns at 80 miles an hour the handling and performance is more than satisfactory.  I wish it had the rainsense wipers I had on my Cadillac as well as the backup warning system. Other than that we love our Buick Rainiers.
buick,rainier,2005,jim & Lou, 04/24/2005,Our Ranier,4,"Just completed a 6,000 mile trip with this vehicle. My husband and I both remarked how easy the SUV was to drive.  As though it just glided along the hiway.  With the air supension in it no matter how we packed the stuff in it, it always evened itself out and was the most comfortable ride we have ever had. We traveled thru mountains, deserts, plains, large cities, small cities, 4 lanes, 2 lanes, and every type of road imaginable and the vehicle just seemed to adjust to the road and conditions by itself.  My husband is 6 foot tall and this is the first vehicle that we have purchased that his head does not touch the top of the car and he has plenty of room for his legs also.  We are happy with the Rainier."
buick,rainier,2005,Roseann, 05/21/2005,The Way To Go,4,"I test drove this SUV and knew it was the one for me.  It drives like a luxury car, handles the road well, very quiet and looks great.  "
buick,rainier,2005,Gary, 08/02/2005,Exciting Fun SUV,4,"Purchased my new 2005 Rainier in July, and have 600 miles on it. It came with most every option available. GM Employee discount and rebates helped. Having a '97 Ford Explorer for 8 years, I was tired of the rough truck ride. I test drove the new Explorer (better) and a couple others. After reading consumer reviews; the Buick sold me for what you got for the price. Wanted a bit more luxury & smoother ride. It's a fun SUV to drive, very quiet, very comfortable, very smooth ride, nice handling, responsive, V6 has plenty of power. Bose sound system is worth the money. Major complaint in all reviews, the front cup holders, I totally agree, they are too small & worthless! More safety features would be nice"
buick,rainier,2005,Nanny, 09/19/2005,My Buick,5,"This is the first car I have purchased.  I previously owned a Park Avenue and my husband owned a GMC Pick Up.  I loved both and didn't need both so the salesman suggested I purchase an SUV.  I have made a couple of trips to Atlanta and love the power, V6, the ride, It reminds me of my car and gives me the height of the truck.  There is plenty of room for me to travel as I want.  My sister and I will make a trip to Norfolk, Va in October and she has a small scooter which will fit in the back real  well.  I couldn't be happier with my decision.  The only way, would be if it were paid for."
buick,rainier,2005,Mac, 01/13/2006,Best SUV Ever,4,"We have owned our 2005 Ranier CXL AWD for about 14 months.  It is by bar the best overall SUV we have ever owned.  The ride quality is outstanding, the handling sharp, the performance excellent, and the carrying capacity fantastic.  Overall we get about 20 mpg on the highway (70 - 75 mph) and about 15 in town.  My wife likes it so much that I seldom get to drive it except on trips.  It is one of the quietest vehicles I have ever driven.  The size, ergonomics, features, and performance are just about perfect for the two of us.  Our friends enjoy very much when we take the Ranier, going out to dinner."
buick,rainier,2005,skeet, 11/15/2006,I'm buying another,4,I have never owned a vehicle I have liked more. Traded a BMW and would never go back. Feel reviewers have given this vehicle a bad rap. I like everything about this vehicle and can't wait to get my new one. Also own a DTS Caddy and really would just as soon drive the Buick. Runs like a scalded dog. A/C is fantastic. Ride is wonderful. Edmunds say Toureg or 4Runner? I say pooey. 6'1 250 lbs this is one roomy vehicle. Wonderfully reliable. What more can I say? Have owned Suburban and like this much better. Turns on a dime. Easy to park.
buick,rainier,2005,Ed Chandler, 01/05/2007,A New SUV Owner,4,Easy to drive and maneuver in parking lots. Plenty of power in the 6 cylinder engine. Doesn't cruise on open roads as well as the LaSabre I owned previously but is much better on mountain roads. I like the inside comfort and controls. Plenty of storage space in the rear. Very smooth and quiet ride.

My husband has always wanted to take it from me and keep it as his own. It handles so well. I feel safe. I know my kids are safe. The ride is so smooth. The sound system is great. For the price, I feel that I have gotten so much more than I paid for. Love it. Love it. Love it. Can't wait to get my next Buick. I am sold and super excited about all the new models Buick is offering. To be honest I always thought Buicks were just for ""old people"". Forget about it. The new models are hot!! and I can't wait to trade up! Won't be the least bit apprehensive either. "

Now my transmission is slipping and it doesn't want to move faster than 35mph.It won't shift into 3rd gear.What else can go wrong with this car....If I knew what i know now about it I would never have bought it! Oh and warranty parts at carmax SUCKS!6MO OR 6000 MILES WHICH COMES FIRST, HOW ABOUT A YEAR LIKE OTHER PLACES OR DEALERS!"
buick,rainier,2005,Disappointed in PA, 03/26/2005,Ambivilent,3,"Replaced my Lexus RX300 with an American car.  Love the drive, size of cargo space but disappointed with the navigation system.  Had 3 other cars with navigation previous to this. This car I have to replace my CD with the Nav disk.  What a pain.  The sticker said it had a 6 CD changer but when I checked it out the navigation system had replaced the 6 CD changer.  How dispointing.  Then the Nav system requires you change areas (NJ and PA are not in the same districts).  Shame on you GM.  DON'T BUY THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM.  It is not worth it.  Get an external one if you must have it.  Can't believe we got ripped off but love the car and only drive it around town luckily."
buick,rainier,2005,Mark Ayers, 03/31/2005,Best SUV We Test Drove & Bought,4,"This is an elegant SUV that handles like a dream, with all the creature comforts you would want in a luxury SUV. It drives well, has great acceleration, and feels like it is floating. Some have criticized the rear suspension, but we have not found that to be an issue. We test drove other SUV's, even imported models, and for the money and accessories, it won."
buick,rainier,2005,LWhitmer, 04/14/2005,Not perfect but very good,4,"I've now had the car for 2 months and still find it very nice to drive - very quiet and smooth. It does have some problems though. The transmission does not downshift smoothly, ever.  The AWD system is rather poor in snow - too much torque goes to the rear wheels making hills a real challenge that my previous Blazer ate up like butter.  I find the braking and handling are quite good for an SUV even in emergency manuevers.  All in all, a very good highway cruiser."

This 5 seater with ample luggage space is perfect for our family of 4 - I frequently carry large trunk size cases. As a conservative driver I'm pleasantly surprised with our reasonable town mileage. I can honestly highly recommend this luxury SUV - if you don't want to pay an Escalade price, but want a handsome prestigious SUV - look no further than the Buick Rainier - I love this vehicle ."
buick,rainier,2005,kuba, 09/06/2004,Rainier all its supposed to be,4,"I've had my Rainier for 6 mos. now and 
am EXTREMELY satisfied with it.  It's 
powerful, smooth, and quiet.  The 
engine is terrific delivering good 
torque from a standstill.  It's 50-70 
mph acceleration is good as well.  Fuel 
economy has been good for an SUV, about 
19 mpg combined city/hwy.  It also has 
been incredibly smooth and quiet, the 
most car-like ride I've experienced 
from the various SUVs I've test 
driven.   I had a Toyota 4Runner before 
and was going to buy another or a 
Nissan Pathfinder before a friend 
suggested I look at the Rainier.  I was 
skeptical at first, but after looking 
at it and test driving it, I was 
convinced.  "
buick,rainier,2005,asoftwind37, 09/22/2004,Lap of luxury,4,"I love the handling of this SUV. I've 
only owned it over a month but I've 
already put over 1500 miles on it. The 
easy exit seat button is great 
especially when you have packages that 
you just grab off the seat next to you, 
you don't have to fight around the 
steering wheel to get them by it. Both 
of my boys are over six foot tall and 
when we were trying out SUV's, head 
room and leg room was a huge factor. 
They picked this one as the the most 
comfortable back seat of all."
buick,rainier,2005,over40, 10/02/2004,Love my Rainy,5,"Got this vehicle as a rental while work 
was being done on my van. I have NEVER, 
NEVER, NEVER loved a car in my life.
This car is quiet, and hugs the road, 
and is absolutely QUIET."
buick,rainier,2005,cgcovey, 10/09/2004,My Rainier,4,"I have driven SUV's from full size 
Blazers, Yukons, Envoy to the Rainier.  
I love the Rainier, great car, great 
design."
buick,rainier,2005,Tom Weiss, 10/09/2004,My,4,"I use my Rainer both in pleasure and 
business and love it. It has ample 
storage space with the rear seats down
(I have moved 6 1/2 foot sofas and 
large bookcase units in it with no 
problem) in addition to a full day of 
shopping at Macy's, Saks and Nordstroms 
and then while still full of the days 
shopping, picking up my 3 German 
Shepards from the groomer with still 
room to spare.
Fit and finish on ""Gracie"" is great 
with 16K on the odometer, she is as 
quiet and well behaved as the day I 
bought her.

I have the 6cyl and find it more than 
satisfactory with my routine drivng 
between Palm Springs, Ca. to Pasadena, 
Ca.

Interior finish is great, too!"
buick,rainier,2005,Kathy7, 10/09/2004,Great Car,4,"The only thing my Rainer falls short on 
is interior storage space.  I had a 
Rendevous for the last 3 years that had 
tons of space.  But the ride and 
handling in the Rainer surpass the 
Rendezvous.  Love this vehicle!!!"
buick,rainier,2005,bruceslade, 11/10/2004,Rayonier,4,"It is a sweet ride.
My wife's car.. she loves it for its 
handling, ease to enter & exit 
(especially for aging parents)and 
appearance. Navigation system was a 
must for her traveling.  We had no 
intention of getting XM radio, once we 
tried it we never turned it off."
buick,rainier,2005,viking1, 12/11/2004,Happy Driver,5,"This vehicle is quiet and smooth.  The 
bose premium sound, multiple cd player 
and satellite reception are 
tremendous.  My previous vehicle was a 
yukon which was great and trouble free 
but this Ranier is outstanding.  The 6 
cylinder engine is lively and it will 
jump when you need it.  "
buick,rainier,2005,J. Mazza, 12/07/2004,Buick Scores well,4,"Great highway performance.  Quiet/solid
feel.  V8 runs well with reasonable gas
milage.  Has all the bells one requires
for an SUV.  excellent radio/Cd sound
system.  Confortable seats."
buick,rainier,2005,Bob Stack, 12/07/2004,Classy Ride,4,"Very quiet and smooth car like ride.Lots
of city driving so it's difficult to
judge mileage.V-6 is just OK."
buick,rainier,2005,G. Toll, 12/12/2004,What were they thinking?,2,"For a car with a $38000 sticker, it was 
quite a surprise to learn what this car 
doesn't have, like - a second remote 
key, a valet key, a glovebox and under-
hood light, and even a coat hanger.  It 
does have a smooth, quiet ride, but you 
wouldn't expect on a test drive to have 
to search for items you would expect to 
find in a car costing one-third less.  
Buying this car is getting taken for a 
ride."
buick,rainier,2005,L. Porter, 01/15/2005,BUICK RAINIER,4,"Most enjoyable driving vehicle ever 
owned.  Catches eye of others.  Love 
the interior appointments with the 
exception of having to use a flashlight 
to see inside glove compartment.  
Handles well and is very maneuverable 
in tight spaces."
buick,rainier,2005,buddyboopotato, 01/20/2005,Nice Vehicle with the discounts,4,"I was giving up on American SUVs after 
a lousy experience with a Chevy 
Blazer, but then I found the Rainier 
after looking at Trailblazers.  A much 
nicer platform, but the list pricing 
is insanely high.  However, with all 
of the discounts at year's end (since 
they had 5 months inventory), I got it 
at $23,900 total cost for an 04 CXL 
AWD, and then with trade in and cash 
down, got it out the door below 
$17,000.  For that kind of money, it 
is hard to beat.  Great ride, very 
quiet, nice comfort features, and good 
performance.  My only disappointment:  
gas mileage--avg 16.  was hoping to be 
closer to 18, but I realize this is a 
large and heavy vehicle.  I'd 
recommend, especially with the deals."
buick,rainier,2005,Jim, 01/26/2005,My Rainier,4,"Nice comfortable SUV.  Good Power in 
the 6 and I think plenty of storage.  
Sound proofed windows make it very 
quiet inside.  My wife even likes to 
drive it.  Had Blazers (3) and this is 
a good change.  Lots of whistles and 
bells at least for this country boy.  
Mileage has been trip 19.2 (cruise) and 
around town 18.  Not too different than 
Blazer but I use 87 Octane now and no 
clicking like in the Blazers.  Sound 
system is no Bose but is acceptable.  
Climate contol can be confusing even 
with instructions but good when you get 
the hang of it. Excellent 
instrumentation. Has a compressor which 
I thought was overkill but I've used it 
twice already.  I must say overall, I 
like it a lot.  "
buick,rainier,2005,skesell, 01/27/2005,Love It!,4,"I get a kick out of the professional 
reviewers as they think if it's not 
Japanese or European, they cannot 
possibly like it! Well, I have owned 
nearly all of them and this Buick is 
as quality laden, good driving and 
responsive as anything I have ever 
owned. My is V8 and mileage isn't the 
best but I love this vehicle. My 
friend bought the Lexus instead and 
after a trip in the Buick he is sick.
I just cannot say enough about how 
much my family has enjoyed this 
vehicle. Thanks for the opportunity to 
say so!"
buick,rainier,2005,Kevin, 03/09/2005,Rainier experience,4,"The Rainier has proven to be comfortable and it performs well.  The air suspension makes for a comfortable ride and the interior is very quiet.  My city mpg has been about 14, and on  a recent 2800 mile trip my highway mileage was just under 20 mpg with 4 passengers and a full load.  The only problem I have had with the vehicle was a molding on the rear hatch that came loose. "
buick,rainier,2005,quarque, 03/09/2005,Rainier really shines,4,"The best vehicle I've ever driven. Rides very well and is VERY quiet and comfortable. AWD with 275 HP 6 is fantastic.  Air suspension and heated seats are just icing on the cake. The ""pros"" rate this car a ""6"" just because it is not a BMW or sports car. Frankly, I didn't want a sports car. I wanted quiet comfort and this is IT.  The little extras like access to the air compressor make it sweet. I test drove Honda, Toyota and Nissan - no comparison to the solid, quiet feel of the Rainier.  The Pilot was noisier than my old Blazer. I will keep this vehicle a very long time after paying $33k with 0% financing. "
buick,rainier,2005,Steven, 03/13/2005,My little opinion,4,"I have yet to find something dissapointing about my brand new Rainier.  I read this page Edmunds.com vehicle review and I dissagree with the obvious negative slant.  The Rainier is everything I wanted in an SUV.  Of course the mileage is bad, but when we were shopping for an SUV, we agreed that we don't give a darn about gas mileage. It is so comfortable that my dad even said it was nicer than his Lincoln. We will keep this Rainier forever.This handles excellent in snow and ice.  I was showing it off to my pal (who bought one also)and I couldn't lose control in the snow.  I tried everything to skid, but the Rainier wouln't have it. "
buick,rainier,2005,J Byrd, 03/18/2005,Buick Rainier,4,The Buick Rainier that my wife and I purchased was a being driven by the owner of the dealerships wife. The car is all that we had expected at this time in our ownership of it. The ride is exceptional and has all the room that we need since our kids are away at college. The power and handling seem to be fine also. We have not had the opportunity to take the car on an extended road trip to get an accurate estimate of highway millage but local driving seems to yield around 17 mpg. In short at this point my wife loves the car so I'm happy with it also 
buick,rainier,2005,Kim, 03/18/2005,Comfy ride,4,I haven't had it long. I had a 96 Blazer before moving up to this SUV. It is very comfortable and handles well. It has a lot of luxury features the my other SUV did not have. It is quiet. You don't hear a lot of extra road noise. It is a very smooth riding vehicle. I love it!
buick,rainier,2005,sally, 04/02/2008,Love my Rainer,4,"I have own my Rainer for 3 years and love the smooth, quiet driving. But most all I love my satellite radio, I will never go back to listening to AM or FM.  "
buick,rainier,2005,Frank Grimes, 01/30/2005,Terrible in the Snow,2,"For a vehicle with a $38,000 plus price, you would expect it to drive very well in the snow.  This SUV does not even drive well in 2-3 inches of snow.  The back end wants to slide all over the road.  You would be better off and safer driving a car front wheel drive car in the snow."
buick,rainier,2005,Roger Hall, 06/27/2005,Jan's Rainier,4,This is a wonderful car. Comfortable to drive on long and short trips. The Air ride makes for a very smooth ride. A very nice looking vehicle. 
buick,rainier,2006,missmegs702, 08/15/2013,Love my Buick!,4,"After owning many other cars, incl. a Mercedes C230, my Buick Rainier is by far my favorite car, maybe ever. I'm in my early 30's, and a few years ago I probably would have scoffed at driving a Buick. In 2011 we were looking for a work SUV for my hubby (trailblazer, etc) and came across it at a dealership and got it for a steal. The next year he bought a truck, and I happily took over the Rainier. It is so comfortable, air ride is fantastic and it drives great. We got an extended warranty and had to have some of the suspension fixed (airbags and sensors) right after we bought it, but really no issues since. Have taken it on several long trips and it's just so comfortable! Really a great SUV."
buick,rainier,2006,Bill, 10/30/2009,Truly useful,4,"I purchased this former short-term rental vehicle with 13k miles on it in Dec '06. Now with 65k miles on it, the only thing that has malfunctioned was a headlight relay, quickly replaced under warranty. It's dead reliable, smooth, comfortable, great in snow and good at towing a 4k lbs, 26ft sailboat.  Milage average is 19 mpg with mostly highway driving. Quality of materials and assembly is very high - the leather upholstery is actually better than that in my '04 Mercedes."
buick,rainier,2006,Frank, 11/15/2008,Best Car I ever drove,4,"After driving a Ford Explorer for almost 200,000 miles, my Buick Rainer has been a pleasure to drive. The ride and features are great--especially air adjustable load levelers. Great car."
buick,rainier,2006,John T Valentine, 08/01/2005,Rainier,4,"A gook looking SUV with all the options. Nice drive with power.  Very quiet and a smooth ride. The fuel economy is poor, city 16 highway at 20. Headroom for a big guy like myself is not as much as I would like, but would be fine for anyone under 6 foot 1.  Nice engine."
buick,rainier,2006,JB, 05/06/2007,Glad I Found This One,4,"I love this vehicle. I've owned several autos in the past, including two Toyotas and a Chevy Trailblazer ('04). I usually go pretty basic on them, then look at the owner's manual later and realize all the goodies I didn't have on mine. All that has changed with buying the Rainier. If this truck were a movie, it would truly be a ""sleeper.""  I don't know why more people haven't discovered all the virtues of this vehicle. "
buick,rainier,2006,Rainer, 06/26/2009,Impressive,4,"Great driving, it does not feel like I'm riding in a truck! - The look of the vehicle is what I love the most."
buick,rainier,2006,keith, 08/19/2009,sharp ride,4,Bought suv to replace 2002 saturn. Drove the rainer beause it had options like the SL 300 saturn.The mileage at 41000 was 19.7 now meaning 10 months later mileage 16.7.All is far better in safety and road control with this vehicle.Sharp and great ride.
buick,rainier,2006,mcquiston, 08/21/2006,My car,4,Very limtied cup holders. Front seats need to go back another couple of inches for taller people.  The settings should be key linked and not linked via remote
buick,rainier,2006,Adrian, 12/01/2005,Better than Lexus,5,Having looked at all models in this price range I selected the Rainier and don't regret it at all. Quieter ride than Lexus and other competitors and the finish is superb. Mileage was as expected - average 19 overall.
buick,rainier,2006,Rick, 01/03/2006,My Buick,4,Nice ride.  Only negatives are fuel mileage and cup holders.  It has all the equipment that our Yukon had.
buick,rainier,2006,LENA BELSHER, 08/04/2006,Love My Ranier,4,"I have owned many SUVs over the past 15 years, and the Ranier beats them all, in comfort,features,and quality. There are so many standard features, which will be extras in any other SUV. It is fun to drive, and gas mileage is decent for a mid size SUV. My sister, brother, and cousin all bought TrailBlazers, and now wish they would of checked out the Ranier.  They love it. You will get your money's worth! I highly suggest that if you are in the market for an SUV, you have to check out the Buick Ranier!"
buick,rainier,2006,Holly, 01/03/2007,Amazing SUV!,5,"This car is the best!  My husband and I bought it for the room, safety features and comfort. We will be starting a family soon and this car is great.  My friend bought one because she loved driving in mine so much."
buick,rainier,2006,ken, 06/03/2006,Better than expected,4,We bought our Rainier 1 month ago and we both love it. It is quiter & smoother than we expected and so far the build quality is flawless. Like all SUV's we would like better gas mileage however it's what we expected. I have no complaints.
buick,rainier,2006,Norman, 08/18/2006,Really disappointed,2,"We should have taken a longer test drive and done more homework. The seats are extremely uncomfortable.  Tried to trade it in after a month, but already no trade-in value. The dealer obviously didn't want it back! "
buick,rainier,2006,bob, 06/09/2006,Like the Rainer,4,"I have had my Rainer for 2 weeks. I bought a program car with 8600 miles on it. Love the ride, comfort quiet and handling. This replaced my 2000 Jimmy, wow what a difference. So far, the mileage has been about 20 to 21 mpg 70% hwy and 30% town driving. I am real pleased with this. I will be looking a purchasing the 100K GM extended warranty, and deals on this?"
buick,rainier,2006,jelap, 02/04/2007,"My ""BIG"" SUV",2,"I have been a 2006 SUV Buick owner for about 7 months now. Overall I am disapointed with the performance with the V6 291hp AWD, Hits slight inclines with a lot of difficulty, have to shove into 3rd gear to climb hills. Comfort wise, it is OK for me for my medium frame and build. Not very good on gas, get about 17-18 on streets, look at the mileage before you buy and factor in your daily/weekly/monthly cost. It is a sleek sexy car for the average person, The quality of the car is ""huh"" OK. The doors are ""very"" heavy and make a lot of noise when opening and closing, I tried oiling and greasing them, but to no avail. The lift mechanism for the hydraulics, when adjusting for heavy loads, is very noisy."
buick,rainier,2006,Toby, 08/01/2017,2006 Buick RunAndDontGoNier,2,"It's been an ok vehicle, except for...
- Window control panel shorted out and was smoking when it got a little rain on it and woke up to all windows down and no way to roll them back up
- Load stabilizer pump just stopped working for a month, then started working again but was really slow.
- Traction control doesn't like sharp right turns and engages and disengages repeatedly then gives an error that there is something wrong with the traction control for the rest of the drive then the next day no error.
"
buick,rainier,2006,Barb, 10/23/2006,Falls Short,3,"Our Buick Ranier has plenty of interior room, and has so far been very reliable. However, the interior build quality leaves alot to be desired!  Everything from the door handles, and door power panel mouldings, to side door mouldings has fallen off and the seatbelts stick. The rear end makes an ""undetermined"" noise and it does not handle great if you have to do any sudden ""avoidance manuevers"" while driving.  I drive mostly highway and have never seen anywhere near the supposed 21mpg mark. I average 17.2mpg in a 2WD.  It should not be in the luxury class, as it is just another mediocre GM SUV.  Admittedly disappointed. Can't wait til my lease is up!  Terrible resale value. GM will never listen to what buyers really want...Thats why Toyota & Honda have really taken off.  They listen to concerns and work with them to build vehicles people want."
buick,rainier,2006,BKnight, 12/05/2006,Great Vehicle--No more van!,4,"I love my Rainier. I have the PGA Tour edition. The only drawback is the odd cup holder and storage situation, but otherwise I am very pleased. MPG average is 17-18 (I drive on country roads to work each  day.) It gets 22- 24 on the highway. I had a loaded Honda Odyssey. I'm so glad to be out of the van! "
buick,rainier,2006,Ken, 07/21/2010,Problems,3,My grandmother bought this car used for me. She purchased the v8. Of course mpg is terrible. Great power and acceleration. Not enough storage room inside car though. Have had many problems and it has been in the shop for about 2 weeks with some sort of engine problem. ugh!
buick,rainier,2006,shrimp525, 08/08/2006,Horrible Gas Mileage,3,"I really love the way my new car drives, but the gas mileage is horrible. I have been averaging 10.1 miles per gallon. I have tried driving with the windows open but nothing helps. I do love the car but I would like to get more mileage from a tank of gas. I drove almost all highway and got 239 miles on a full tank."
buick,rainier,2006,w gotwals, 08/22/2006,Junk,2," 1197 total miles and the car would not start.  Complete electrical shut down.  It""s been out of service for 3 days now attempting to be fixed.  Can't GM do a little better job"
buick,rainier,2006,Cindy, 07/22/2008,Few Suspension and Transmission Concerns,3,"I purchase my used Rainier in December of 2007. For the most part I am very satisfied. I have had ongoing stabiltrack issues, and the driver's window keeps coming out of the track. My most recent problem was that the shift sensor, wiring harness and valve body went out at 40,600 miles. I am thankful for the 50,000 mile warranty.  I was told that there is nothing that can be done about the window. ""Don't roll it down while going down the road"". GM and the dealership refused to do a transmission service after my transmission got hot. They had it pulled apart and had the filter in their hand. I love the vehicle, but can't say that I will buy GM because of the service."
buick,rainier,2006,Richard, 10/01/2008,Great mid-sized SUV,4,"Really like this vehicle. It's super quiet and smooth riding. Has a classy look to the exterior and the interior is quite comfortable. Absolutely no problems in a little over 33,000 miles. Gas mileage over the long run is 18.2 mpg in 95% city driving - very few freeway miles. Not bad for the size and comfort of this vehicle. Back seat passengers don't have much legroom, but it's not designed to be a full-size SUV.  Cupholders are a little quirky, but only a minor concern."
buick,rainier,2006,Michelle, 12/26/2008,AWD Issues,3,"From week one, the Rainier has attempted to shift into AWD when in reverse. The shuddering that results makes it very difficult to back out of a parking space. Changing the rear differential fluid ($125) didn't help. Now the bearings in the front differential just burned up. Thankfully, the Buick dealer covered it even though I am 4,000 miles out of warranty. I am considering dumping this vehicle as I drive 30,000 miles per year and can't afford to be towed to the dealer on a regular basis."
buick,rainier,2006,Ty K, 11/18/2005,Replaced My Rendevous,4,"I purchased a 2004 Rendevous and this 2006 Rainier replaced it.  I missed a couple of features from the Rendevous.  There is no parking assist and it does not customize the radio and seat settings on the key fob like the Rendevous.  It does have curb view on the rear view mirror, but the mirrors are smaller than the Rendevous.  The Rainier feels more stable on the road than the Rendevous and is quieter.  I am getting better mileage than with my old Rendevous."
buick,rainier,2006,Elizabeth , 11/17/2005,Great,4,Me and my family of two boys decide to buy this car it had a very reasonable price for the amount of luxury that was provided. The seats are very comfortable the ride is extremley quite and comfortable. The power is okay but could be more. I love the look of the car. I would recomend it anyday. But the cup holders up front need improvment.
buick,rainier,2006,BANKER, 03/27/2006,Great SUV,4,I had owned Jeeps for 20 years. This vehicles is superior in many ways. It drives and handles better. Mileage is better and it rides very nice. It is very quiet and has all the power you need with a V-8. I am very pleased with this purchase and would buy again.
buick,rainier,2006,JAMES ZUNIGA, 05/08/2006,Fun to drive,4,Fun to drive. Very smooth riding and quiet. Comfortable seats. Easy to park. Lots of power for an inline 6. Has lots of extras that are optional on other vehicles. The navigation is simple and handy.
buick,rainier,2006,ranier, 04/14/2006,"Ranier, Surprise",4,"We bought our Buick Ranier on a whim, while out shopping one day. Normally, this is a foolish thing to do. I had researched so many other SUVs and wanted a 4 wheel drive vehicle for our southwest lifestyle. We immediately went on a four day weekend drive in mountainous Utah. We took a hunters trail over a 9000 foot mountain which included crossing creeks and traversing glaciers etc. No Problem for the 2 wheel drive Ranier. The six cylinder engine moves out very nicely. Comfort is awesome. My wife asked me the other day if I ever suffered from buyers remorse since or impulsive purchase? None. "
buick,rainier,2006,m buckenmayer, 04/16/2006,2006 Buick Ranier,4,"I love this mid size SUV.  I drove over 20 other SUVs before deciding on purchasing the Ranier. It has plenty of pep, even with a 6 cy engine. The interior is the most comfortable of all SUVs I test drove.  I am very tall and need a long seat, the Japanese SUVs were too short seated to give me proper leg or hip support. The ride is quiet, quiet, quiet. I love the XM/CD/ radio/nav system.  Also there is lots of room as I easily can haul 5 golfers and their golf bags. I chose leather interior and it is very comfortable and very classy. The only thing I would change would be more storage space in the middle console."
buick,rainier,2006,Chelle, 10/04/2006,Mostly satisfied,4,"I just purchased this vehicle, but was not looking for it. Wanted an Envoy, and could not get one, so this was suggested. Overall, I am happy with the vehicle. I have always owned a minivan, so this is different. However, the sad part about this vehicle is the gas mileage, it stinks! I was not prepared for the little gas mileage that it gets, but I am keeping it and just have to get used to it. Hopefully it will not let me down. "
buick,rainier,2006,PeterJ, 11/25/2006,Big surprise,4,"Never thought I'd buy a Buick, but after testing the Rainier vs. the Envoy, Pathfinder, 4Runner and looking at everything else it comes out on top.  Smooth, quiet, excellent mix of features, and the V8 gets unexpectedly decent mileage (15.8 city, and 22 highway).    It has been perfect, no issues since day one, hope it stays that way.   On top of all the pluses, the GM rebates made a great deal, over $9000 off MSRP."
buick,rainier,2006,frank, 02/06/2007,Everything I Need,5,After driving a Cadillac Deville for the last 10 years the Rainier compares in features and comfort. I needed a vehicle with the luxury of a Cadillac and towing capacity of a truck. Behold the Rainier is the perfect vehicle for my needs. 
buick,rainier,2006,Joyce, 03/18/2007,Love it,5,I am so happy with my new truck. I went from a 1999 Tahoe to this. There is nothing that comes close to the comfort this truck offers. It is easy on the eyes and you will find your self not wanting to pull up in the garage.
buick,rainier,2006,William Bennett, 06/04/2018,A Great Midsize SUV,4,"No major problems up to 100,000 miles then replaced the computer & fuse box--now runs great!  However, Love the Car. In fact this is the second Ranier I have owned ( a 2004), which still runs great at 220,000 miles, driven by my sister-in-law.
"
buick,rainier,2007,BILL GILL, 08/19/2006,2007 RANIER,4,I think this is a very under-rated SUV. It is so much nicer than the Envoy which is more popular. Very quiet and the fuel economy is about like everything else.
buick,rainier,2007,RonP, 11/28/2007,Great Value and Under-Rated by Editors,5,"With over 17,000 miles on my Rainier, there have been zero problems with the vehicle. I purchased the Rainier because the seats in my 2004 LeSabre were so uncomfortable my wife could not ride in it for any distance, even though we had zero problems with it over 85,000 miles and still experienced 32 mpg on the highway and 22 in my commute to work. The Rainier's ride is great, wind noise in minimal, seating comfort is perfect (I'm 6'4"" and my wife is 5'6""), and the towing and carrying flexibility are outstanding. While the mpg averages are less than the LeSabre, I still average slightly over 22 mpg on the highway and a little over 15 mpg commuting to work. This was Buick's best kept secret!"
buick,rainier,2007,Buick Enthusiast, 05/27/2008,Buick Enthusiast,4,"Smooth and quiet ride, just what you would expect from Buick. The features of am import luxury car in an SUV."
buick,rainier,2007,alex dunn, 01/03/2007,Not a quiet cabin ride,4,The 2004 Rainier that I had rode a lot quietier. This 2007 has a wind noise starting at 35 mph and gets louder. I have had it back to 2 different dealers for this problem as suggested by GM motors. They can doing nothing  at this time because of no recalls or service bulletins. It seems to me that it is the door seals on the back. Sounds like the back window is open a little on both sides
buick,rainier,2007,JMC6, 10/04/2007,A Pleasurable and Performing SUV,5,Have been incredibly pleased with all aspects of this SUV.  The smooth and quiet of the ride are not like an SUV. Plenty of power in the I-6.  Dollar value was outstanding.  It is unfortunate that Buick is not continuing the Rainier.
buick,rainier,2007,Harold, 03/24/2008,Buick Rainier CXL.,4,"Handles great on trips, all the bells & whistles you would want. Biggest complaint is with rear seats down it is difficult to access a cooler behind the driver from the passenger side. Sun visors are to small and for the price you would think it would have pull outs so when you use them as a side visor they would block the top of the drivers/passengers window! Very aggravating!"
buick,rainier,2007,Andy Anderson, 11/12/2006,Buick Ranier,4,"A real truck with real towing capacity, yet as quiet and smooth as most luxury cars in town and on trips. Optional sound system is very good. The nav system in my 2004 was cumbersome, so we left it off the new 2007.  Buick fixed the AWD system, and it engages smoothly in 2007.  Competent handling for a luxury truck. Don't drive or evaluate it as a sports sedan.  I used to make jokes about people who drive Buicks, but this vehicle grows on you."
buick,rainier,2007,Keith, 07/30/2007,Pleasant Surprise,4,"We were looking at the Acacia when the dealer showed us the Rainier. The value for the Rainier was exceptional. We towed our boat on a 2,000 mile excursion through the Sierras and it pulled with very little problem. Comfortable seats, quiet and smooth ride. The fold back rear seat headrests help with vision when no one is riding in the back. The built in air compressor is a plus.  urning radius is very tight."
buick,rainier,2007,Donna, 05/02/2007,Rainier Awesome,5,"The last 3 SUV's we've owened were all Oldsmobile Bravada's which was a step above the Envoy and step below a Cadillac.  When Oldsmobile closed, the Buick division cloned the Bravada with the Rainier. After recently buying the Rainier, we were pleasantly surprised at how beautiful this truck truly is.  The ride is great, performance great and totally compares to the Bravada. Buick came a long way when they created this truck. Not an old man's vehicle anymore!"
buick,rainier,2007,Mike Gurnee, Il,Overall very happy,4,"When it was time to replace my DeVille, we decided to purchase another Ranier.  Now my wife and I both drive Raniers and are extremely satisfied with them.  We have had no problems with the 2004, only going back to the dealer for oil changes.  Hopefully we will get that same level of satisfaction from the new one. Gas mileage is not great but as advertised.  We get 21 to 23 on the highway which is not bad for a heavy vehicle.  Buick did cheapen the interior since 2004 with different sun visor brackets and mirrors and no overhead assist handle over the driver. They did however, add the wood trimmed steering wheel and gear shifter.  "
buick,rainier,2007,Jon M, 07/21/2007,2007 Buick Saved it's best for Last,5,"I got My Rainier by way of a factory order, and toured the factory where it was made in Moraine Ohio.  This vehicle is flat out awesome.  It has a smooth ride and does not have a flat out truck feel at all. It's the quietest I have ever owned.  I have no regrets getting this one.  Just too bad Buick is dropping this model after the 2007 year ends.  Things that need more publicity are DVD Navigation and Onstar Turn by Turn Navigation standard on the 2007 Buick line.  Having both on the same vehicle makes long trips a breeze.  The Voice control of the navigation system is a really great feature.  The factory DVD Navigation can be added later with the Delphi TNR800 Unit from Crutchfield."
buick,rainier,2007,Dave Busch, 03/29/2007,"A Buick, what?",4,"OK, like most of us in my age group (40- 50) the name Buick is not a vehicle we are familiar with unless its a Buick Grand National, an 80s muscle car! At least thats the case for me.  OK, my parents have owned them but I thought it was an old persons carlol  but I guess all things change and after having a family myself  I have become less about speed and performance and more at whats practical and comfortable.  Dont get me wrong for a V-6 putting out an impressive 291 hp and 277 lb-ft of torque its no slouch. after looking at the Envoys I was sold on the Rainier.  The Buick Rainier out classes the Envoy and rides like an upper class town car.  Its the best bang for your buck!"
buick,rainier,2007,Jeff, 02/15/2007,Excellent Buy,4,The interior is very nice and the seating is comfortable. It is a very quiet ride as well. There is a lot of power with the 4.2L V6. I would definitely recommend.
buick,rainier,2007,KN, 03/19/2007,Most Comfortable Car for the Price,4,My husband and I love this car. The ride is incredibly smooth and the comfort is beyond those in the same price range.  There is plenty of room for a family.

buick,regal,2000,Duane Nesset, 11/10/2009,2000 Buick Regal 4 Dr GS Sprchgd Sedan,5,"I just turned over 200,000 miles today. I bought it slightly used with 4000 miles in late 2000. It has been my commute car for years. I started using synthetic motor oil at 75,000 miles. I use Mobil 1 EP in it. Mileage on long highway drives goes over 25 MPG. It left me on the road only twice. Once with a blown water pump three years ago and more recently, something with the supercharger and I had to cut away the tangled belts and limp to a repair station with no power steering. It is still very sporty and and responsive. Suspension was replaced about 4 years ago. Very reliable over all and now will see it running towards the 300K mark."
buick,regal,2000,Jerry, 01/14/2016,"Out of 6 BMWs and 6 Mercedes, my FAVORITE",5,"I've owned 6 BMWs and 6 Mercedes, and I expect a LOT from my cars.  I bought my LSE after getting fed up with being $1000'd to death by Mercedes and BMW.  Thought I'd give a Buick a try, but wasn't really expecting much, considering it was a, well, BUICK.  Boy, was I surprised!  This is my favorite car ever, and I don't say that lightly.  Gets 32 mpg on long trips, has the touring suspension and corners like it's on rails.  As most Mercedes owners will admit, the cruise control and A/C are unreliable at best.  This dual zone automatic climate control is faultless, EVERYTHING ALWAYS WORKS as it should, and this car is really loaded up with options like a Cadillac.  It is absolutely reliable, smooth riding, good power, and fun to drive.  Mercedes could learn a thing or two from this car's reliability, so could BMW.  
 IF you find one of these LSE models and you don't buy it, you should kick yourself hard.  So it's a 2000 model, you'll get tired of it before you'll ever sear it out.  The only weak spot is the front wheel bearings which you will need to replace by 100K miles. It's a simple DIY job. Dont buy the cheap Chinese aftermarket bearings. Go for the Timken.
"
buick,regal,2000,doulos, 02/15/2010,"229,000 miles and counting",4,"Bought the car used in 9/02 with 45,145 miles. Now it has 229,200 miles. This is a very reliable car! It never broke down or left me stranded. There is one thing that you must fix if you buy one of these cars with the 3.8L, and that is the lower intake manifold and gasket. I had mine fixed at 94,000 miles and never any problems. The only other thing I changed out was the front and rear brake rotors due to warped rotors.  Do the scheduled coolant and transmission flushes and it will serve you a long time.  Then just change the oil, tires and brake pads as needed. The leather interior has held up well, no rattles and there is no visible exterior rust!!  Thank you Buick for a great car!"
buick,regal,2000,Judy, 02/18/2017,Best Used Car Purchase EVER!,5,"Today is 8/28/18.  Still have my car.  Still runs great!  Have not really had any other problems with it since my last update.  I do the oil changes regularly and I only use premium gas in her.  Low coolant light comes on and goes off but I have already confirmed that it's the temp sensor.  Will cost me $130 to replace.  Still very pleased with her!  I did discover another thing that I don't like.  What is the sent of having key holes in the door if there is no key??  If battery dies and your car is locked, you will need a locksmith!  

Today is 8/26/17.  I bought my Buick Regal GSE Supercharged on 9/26/16.  It had 116,102 miles on it.  It now has 140,343 miles on it.  (I work 45 miles away from home - one way.  I travel to work 4x a week). Including the owner that I bought it from, it had 3 prior owners.  The original owner was a elderly lady that drove it to the local grocery store and to church; a family member inherited it but didn't drive it much; then the guy that I bought it from owned it.  Before I purchased the car, I did a Carfax on it and got a buy back guarantee through Carfax.  I also got every single maintenance record on the car since it's original purchase.  During the prior owner's possession, he had regular maintenance stuff done plus a new blower motor for ac and heat, the engine valve cover (which was covered under warranty), tie rod ends and wheel bearings hub assembly.  At 118,212 miles- I had to replace the EGR valve  ($334.60).  At 126,863 miles- I had to replace the radiator (502.99).  At 135,965 miles- I had to replace the Mass Air Flow Sensor on it (I left for work for lunch one afternoon, the check engine light illuminated and the car acted like it was going to die, then it surged and sputtered then died.  It came back on and did it again - so I had it towed to my mechanic and they did the diagnostics on it and determined it was the MAF sensor).  I also replaced the serpentine belt replaced on it at the same time ($494.22).  The car runs great!  What I don't like are two things:  1) the cup holder in the center console is annoying to use.  I usually don't use it.  2) and I hate this......the Power Steering Pump reservoir is a pain in the buttocks to access and fill!!!!!!  I had to get on a stool, stick nearly my entire arm down in the engine just to get the cap off.  Then I had to use TWO long neck funnels to get the fluid into the reservoir without spilling it everywhere.  

I have been very pleased with this car.  She is pretty quick too.  :)  Handles well and rides smooth.  I currently have Yokohama tires on it.  I did have Michelin Defenders but had to downgrade for financial reasons. :)

buick,regal,2000,Syd, 11/23/2008,Regal is a great deal if well maintained,4,This is my second Buick with the push rod 3.8. Good power and decent fuel economy. Buicks always feel more substantial than most Chevys and Pontiacs. These cars are a good used buy if you can buy from a caring original owner.

I bought it used and it has been through a lot of hard driving and virtually no maintenance. This car is the most reliable, good looking, well equipped car I have owned and it is a shame they replaced it with the LaCrosse. "
buick,regal,2000,faststrat02, 09/10/2012,"Decent ride, lots of repairs though",3,"Where to begin.
Pros first:

-Car drives wonderfully on the highway, sometimes see 28-29 MPG.
Not bad for a 3.8
-A/C is ice cold (when it decides to work)
-3.8L V6 generally is a solid motor

Cons:
-Window regulator is out on passenger right side (common for this car).

Unfortunately, I've
had to put quite a bit of money into this car. Where to start:

-Struts all around/upper strut mount
-Replaced both valve cover gaskets, tensioner assembly 
-Tie rod ends replaced @ 80k
-Replace Hub bearings/front axle (both sides)
-City gas mileage is horrendous.
 I've yet to see over 20mpg.
Average is 15-17.
Good car for highway travel, but NOT ideal for commuting."

I am a young guy, but I don't care if there is a stigma owning a Buick.... I will buy another!!"

dealer always seems to be too busy to 
help. The transmission is having

60,000 miles, there was something going 
on with the transmission -- the dealer 
says it make be resolved with a 
transmission fluid flush (about $1300) 
or may need a new transmission 
($2600).  I can't understand why the 
transmission should be bad this soon.  
I've driven Buicks for the past 3 cars -
- I may need to go to a Toyota or 
Honda.  This is just ridiculous.  
Otherwise, this is a comfortable ride,

Most recently the drivers door window (power) went out and it cost me 550 dollars to have it fixed. The motor worked but the cable broke. On an earlier situation the front end drug with any dip and the result was a damaged oil pan. Little things like only partial LED digits on the radio and dashboard readout. According to the computer my mileage of 20.1 mpg in city driving is actually questionable as my computations never reached that high. I have a very light foot unless I find myself in a bind and need power to escape a challenge in traffic. No more Buicks for me.

buick,regal,2000,Steve, 08/15/2005,Awesome Car!,4,"I purchased the car as a trade-in while I was working at a Jaguar dealer with about 78,000 miles on it. From the first day I drove it I was impressed with its comfort and performance. I have had it for close to a year now and I cannot picture driving any other car. To be honest, this car feels about as close to a Jaguar as GM will probably ever get. However, the exhaust is a bit wimpy and a Pontiac Grand Prix exhaust would be perfect for the Regal. Also the headrests are very small and do not support the head whatsoever. I'm searching for Century headrests to put in so I can feel safe if I get into an accident, God forbid. The Regal is still a great car and I will always be a Buick buyer!"

has had Buicks for as long as I can 
remember and we have never met a Buick 
that we didn't love (never kept one 
less than 12 years with repairs that we 
consider normal wear and tear).  I 
bought this Regal used (3000 miles left

ABS, sunroof, fuel level sensor, climate display, front wheel bearing, tie rod, key assembly, window motors, etc.   We're at 73K, and to be honest, I'm frightened of the future. When this car starts costing me too much in repairs, I'm buying a Honda,  We've always bought American (GM, specifically), but have come to the realization that they (GM)still don't know how to build true ""quality"" products.

Any sensor you could think of, tire valves, coil packs, a wheel bearing that literally fell apart in my hand when I replaced it; recently had to replace the entire exhaust, catalytic converter, and more sensors. Radiator cracked and leaked into my engine causing it to cease. Started a small oil leak underneath the car a couple days ago and that's all it took for my car to officially trash itself. Whole front went up in smoke, engine overheated and cracked even thought I got an oil change. I always kept up with regular maintence and took good care of my car.

buick,regal,2001,Rob Gray, 07/28/2020,Love this car and would buy another one.,5,"I am 76 and have had many cars; had a 1998 Lumina LTZ, put 158000 miles on and I thought was a pretty good car but this 2001 Regal LS  up graded edition beats it by a long shot. 

I bought the Buick from a friend ( it was his wife's car ), she decided that she needed an SUV. 

This car has the Joseph Aboud package and looks a lot like the interior of a friends new BMW as for as color and trim, but I think that the interior in my Buick beats that of her BMW.

 I love the size of the car and weight, it is just right for me, I am 6/1. I am really pleased with the selection of the power seat, for better than the seat and selection that was on the LTZ, I never liked the seat in that car, it had leather but the seat was to low even on the highest setting. I think the Regal has more head room which gives an advantage for some one of 6`1"".  

Another great thing about the Buick is that where i live in Central MS Buick's are pretty popular so parts are reasonable and plentiful. I had a 2000 Cougar SE  which I really enjoyed but you can't find new head lights for them and even buying salvaged ones cost a lot. Ford should have never let the Cougar die along with the T Bird which I have also owned  and enjoyed, The drivers seat of the Cougar I had sat and felt like the cockpit shall we say of that of the 1958 T Bird that my mother owned. 

 I would buy another Buick Regal in a heart beat. I love the new Regal Sport back, The lift gate, as I call it, like I had on the Cougar and the Sport back on the new Regal spoiled me, especially with the back seats that lay down.! 

Yet I understand that this is the last year that Buick offers the Regal, I think another mistake. They wont to focus on SUV's. I say to Buick, the new Regal sport back is like an SUV and is a lot better looking, so keep it.!!!

performance sleeper.  I love blowing 
off 5 liter Camaros and Mustangs in 
acceleration and passing.

It may look sedate but the performance 
is definitely your daddy's Buick.

buick,regal,2002,Ryan, 12/17/2015,Long Term Review,4,"My family owned this car for around 9 years.  It was my first car and I took a lot of pride in it as it is a car to be proud of.  We had a special edition style and handling package with two tone paint and firmer, more reactive suspension.  While the car isn't particularly special in the curves, it felt awesome until you near the limit and realize how front heavy it is.  The engine was plenty powerful to have fun with, and consistently gave me 29 mpg HWY without fail.  ABS worked great.  Traction control worked surprisingly well even in deep snow up to the bumper.  Never got my car stuck in the winter except for once when it was practically buried overnight.  We did have some problems over the course of the ownership.  The worst one was the ignition switch which shut the car off in heavy traffic.  Other than that, we also had to replace the swaybar, a window motor, window switches, AC clutch, 3 wheel bearings, fender rust and well that's about it.  Pretty good car, but still nickle and dimed over the years.  Probably cost less then 2k for everything over 9 years.  It was really built well though.  Maintained it perfectly and it was still driving like new at almost 170k.  There were no weird squeaks, rattles or anything which is amazing considering how high quality the monsoon radio and speaker system was.  YOU WANT THE MONSOON!  The only wear it showed were a few chips on the aftermarket hood, some fine cracks in the leather, and a light tick from a lifter in the bullet proof Buick 3.8L until she warmed up.  Car was broke in but showed no signs of slowing down.  I trusted it fully to the day I sold it.  It wasn't babied either.  Maintained and  serviced well was not used lightly.  Ditched during winter twice, but no damage was ever taken.

buick,regal,2002,58 Impala, 10/20/2010,Second time around,4,"I bought this very same new in Sept 2002 and kept it for 4 years and traded it for an 06 LaCrosse CXL which I trades in on an 08 Silverado LTZ.  even thought 06 Buick had more features, it didn't pull the mountians  or get the gas mileage the 2002 Regal GS did.  This year we decided we would get a used car and I was searching the net. I found our old Buick at a dealership about 40 miles from here and it had less than 60K miles on it.  It had aroudn 32K when I traded.  The dealership had bought it at an auction, but the car was still in great shape.  We missed car after getting the LacCross and are very happy we found it again.  Great gas mileage, handling and power in a nice size car."

have driven this car on one 7,000 mile

conceivable mix of traffic, road 
surface and weather (including some 
high elevation snow).  It handles very 
predictably under all conditions, has 
plenty of quickly available power to 
handle passing or mountain driving, and 
returns excellent gas mileage.  On one 
occasion, I drove just under 1,000 
miles in one day, with another driver 
relieving me for only about 100 miles.  
The car was comfortable and not tiring, 
even with the excess miles/day.  Fuel

Still going good!Regular work done on it like brakes,rotors,tires,oil changes,etc. That is all normal wear and tear. On second muffler but first one was a cheaper one. Biggest expense was the security in the ignition and key.Kept shutting the car down, making it think it was being stolen.Brought it to dealer and they bypassed the security chip-$380. Most expensive repair done to it. Great in the snow too! Northeast can be brutal! Stereo has shorted out but that's an easy fix too! No major issues. Would recommend a buick.

I am a hugh fan of muscle cars, meaning I like my cars to perform quickly and quietly.  I have owned Chrys, Pont, and Olds.  I have enjoyed driving all these cars.  The 1998 was leaking oil (small amt.), but ran so good I did not want to get rid of it.  I decided that updating to 2002 was a wise move. I tried a 2006 Chev. Impala, but liked the ride and performance of the Buick so much more. Having just purchased it 4-13-06 I have to drive it more and see if it compares as well as the l998, which was excellent. Only draw back is having to use 91 Octane.        "

One thing I have experienced is that when driving at night, when I put on my high beams all the lights on the dash and my head lights go out, I have to hit high beam switch again and all come back on, this has happened numerous times. Also, my Low Coolant light came on, I took to my garage and all was fine, reserve was low but not empty, radiator was full.  The light stays on when I am driving saying low coolant, but all if fine, temp. gauge normal on this car stays in the middle. I really like this car."

She only drove it to the country club and the store. They took a Honda CRV for road trips. Now my family travels alot. So we took it down to florida and the car couldn't get over 55MPG comming back. O2 Sensor or MAF sensor would go out alot so that would stand us at a intersection. It has a basic looking exterior and interior. Has Monsoon Speakers in the car so they have some good sound.  Handlebars and cup holers are really cheep so they break easily. Taillight replacement is a pain in the but trying to replace the four trunk ones. The Dashboard killed it's self and that had to be replaced. (I think 2000 to rebuild or replace) I wouldn't buy this car if a person does not want to pay money to replace a lot of things.

prefer the 3.8l engine over the DOHC 
3.5l, because of vastly increased lower

urban driving situations--i.e, 
accelerating off a ramp from 35-40 mph

superior to Honda 3L, such instant

mated to the excellent 3.8

Koni option would be nice.  This car is 
handsome but invisible, std. ABS with

buick,regal,2003,andyman32, 07/16/2003,Exceptional Vehicle,4,"The car had a few minor defects upon
taking delivery, mostly cosmetic. It has
been 100% reliable, has had absolutely
no mechanical or electrical failures,
and has a remarkably smooth ride while
at the same time offering plenty of
performance for being a fairly heavy
car. The 3.8L V6 offers plenty of power
to maneuver in traffic even at high
speeds. I replaced a 1997 BMW 528i with
this car, and in find the acceleration
to be quite comparable. Contemporary
styling of 1997+ Regals also make it
attractive for younger buyers. I highly
recommend this car as a refined
alternative to the Mercury Sable or
Cadillac CTS."

Lots of power, and a marvelous auto trans.  Outstanding MPG on trips, especially considering the power.  Quiet, comfortable ride, feels solid, no rattles.  Big trunk.  Both of these vehicles have been utterly reliable, and very inexpensive to maintain.  A lot of folks laugh at the idea of a Buick, but I only need to impress myself.  They're welcome to their expensive, maintenance-intensive German ego props.  This Buick's a terrific buy, and I'm sorry they won't be making any more in 5 years."

Yes, I'm in my late 30's and we just wanted a 'old folk's' car for when our elderly parents flew in to visit a few times a year, but my wife and I discovered that the Regal was comfortable to drive, and got great mileage for a work/highway car.  We currently own a BMW 3-series and an Infiniti G35x, and yes, we both agree this has a 'different', yet comfortable ride, and a feeling of roominess in the cabin unlike our sporty cars - never had a single issue with it - we enjoy it!"

I thought to myself, I'd love this drive-train in a smaller car that handles better. Then, my favorite local dealer gets in this Regal. I loved it from the first drive. Got a great price and now I'm lovin' it. Who cares if my friends think I'm an old man now. They're paying alot more to be cool than I am. HA."

I was able to get out of deep snow up the hill without any difficulty but had to push my friend in her Jeep!  I am just getting around to replacing the original struts and have replaced two wheel bearings so far.  Other than regular maintenance there is nothing out of the ordinary with repairs.

My Regal is comfortable on long and short drives. My only complaint is road noise. It can get loud on grooved pavement.  After 40000 miles the body is still tight with no squeaks and rattles. The 3.8 liter engine is peppy for a V6 and acceleration is adequate enough to enter freeways and pass other vehicles on 2-lane highways. I have enjoyed this car and hope to drive it for many more years.

One in Trenton, NJ area and the other in White Plains, NY. I emailed Coleman and the salesman called the next morning. A pristine condition fully loaded 2004 Black GS just off a three year lease with 42k enticed me to drive over 50 miles to see it. After getting the sticker reduced by over $1000, and seeing the excellent shape of the black paint, I bought it. Now I have a car that I know and love and am making sure that all the tips and techniques that I put into the first will go into the second.

touch it in that department. The 
interior, and exterior, could use some 
freshening, but overall looks 
expensive, with leather, heated seats,

I just spent two months shopping certified used Accords, Passats,  Maximas, and even Mercedes C-Series.  My car is a MB E500 and I'm a Mercedes fan.  But my wife wanted a classy, sporty, good mpg, non-Mercedes car to replace her VW Passat.  I thought for sure she would go for the Passat or one of the others.  Then we drove a few Regals.  Two weeks after driving the first Regal we bought one.  Best car I think I've ever owned!  Go drive one.  "

Everything they say about this vehicle is true.
It is quite a change from most of the staid Buicks
from the past.
The styling is fantastic, and the interior is comfortable with plenty of room for my 6' frame.
With the interactive system you have almost a sports car feel with this vehicle, and a decent mpg."
buick,regal,2011,dap0922, 07/30/2012,Surprised by Buick!,4,"I didn't seek out a Buick when I started my search mainly based on the memories of the Buick's that my grandpa drove.
Those were respectable cars at the time, but I was not interested in driving a ""big boat"".
As a young professional, Buick seemed dated.
I was looking for 3 things, 1)good gas mileage , 2) comfortable and high tech interior, 3) ""head-turning"" exterior styling - all at an good price of course.


After looking at other cars for a few months, I came across the Regal.
I hesitated at the thought of buying a Buick, but was blown away at the ""reimagined"" Brand.
I was impressed at the styling and handling. This definitely isn't my grandpa's Buick!"
buick,regal,2011,quattro5, 02/09/2011,I really like this car,4,"This is the 1st American sedan I have owned. I have had 3 Accords and 2 Camrys since college between me and my wife.
Most recent was 08 Accord. Lease just up so i returned it and got the Regal.
Really liked the looks and the incentives being offered were hard to turn down, considering it is my tax dollars at work! Car drives and handles very well. Finish and build quality is excellent.
Features far, far exceed my 08 LX-P Accord and I am paying $50 less per month. Handling beats that car also.
Far quieter and smoother as well.
Yes the car is slightly underpowered but no more so than the 4 cylinder Accords.
Reviewers are making way more out of that. Great car so far."
buick,regal,2011,Rob C, 01/27/2016,Nice car but suprisingly lower gas mileage,4,"I should have read up more on the actual gas mileage folks are getting. The sportiness and looks and features are great. The radio is too many buttons and they have changed it on newer models. My 2015 F150 Supercrew 2.7 Ecoboost (twin turbo) mileage advertised is 19/26. I averaged 18 all around but mid to high 20's on highway. I would have thought this tiny regal would do better just looking at it's small size. It looks almost exactly like the Verano until you see the swooping curve on the side is opposite. It feels compact but labeled a mid size. Nice to drive, fun even. I like it but many other cars loaded similarly do better on gas and the larger buicks can even beat it. Overall happy I just did not expect truck like gas mileage but it is a lot easier to part. 13K for a 2011 with 48K miles. I was shopping for a Cadillac CTS but when I saw this I jumped on it. The European styling similar to a BMW/AUDI is nice. Overall happy and trying like crazy to keep the foot pedal off the floor for better mileage, the first fill up the average was 16mpg...."
buick,regal,2011,nydogboy, 03/21/2014,Dead Duck,4," The ladies love the sporty look, but, if you are more than 5'8"" you'll be challenged to enter this car.

It's hard to keep the RPMs under 2200 because it keeps shifting around town.
It is a pleasure to drive on the highway.
I was hoping the 6-speed, 4 cylinder Regal would get better mileage than my v-6, 210 hp Malibu Maxx...wrong. It's about the same.
I like the car and hope to have it for 5 or more years, which I typically do.
03/22/2016:  I love this Buick and have no intentions of trading it.  It's a comfortable, steady, reliable and familiar vehicle.  Front disc brakes new at 51,000 miles, otherwise just simple oil changes.  The 4 cylinder is still peppy and hard to keep under 75-80.
A great car all around and it looks great too!
09/27/2018: Same car.  Nothing has gone wrong with it except for a power steering noise that has been troublesome, although it's not losing fluid. Going to the dealership for a complete evaluation in a couple of days.
WARNING: I needed a new resonator at 55,000 miles.  The car sounded like a truck. I searched everywhere and there is no part number for the resonator.  The entire exhaust system has to be replaced [$1100]. New pipes and mufflers, which were not a problem. This was the biggest expense in seven years.
Still planning on keeping it because now it is only worth about $6000. SAFETY: In May 2019 I was T-Boned by a Tundra, right in the drivers-side door.  The side airbags deployed immediately and I walked away without a scratch.  There goes my plans for keeping it and the four new tires it had on it.
I still recommend for short people.

At that time I loved everything about the car, but that changed quickly!  After having this car for 6 out of the 7 years (I bought this car used with 3400 miles on it) it is turning into a piece of JUNK!  at around 15000 miles part of the transmission went out.  Several pieces of the interior started flaking making the inside look like crap!  I had the onstar antenna replaced twice.  My headlights fill up with moisture and water, which by the way is not covered under warranty, so I have to have crappy looking headlights.  I had an oil consumption problem as well and at 45000 miles the pistons and rings had to be replaced!!  Now at 46000 mile the transmission is acting up again and needs to be fixed!  If I did not purchase an extended warranty I would have been screwed!!!! The total cost is at $3000.00 to fix it.   I have a warranty till October 2019 and after that this car is being traded in!!!!  Probably not on another Buick!  This has got to be the worst car every purchased besides the 06 Buick Rendezvous CXL I purchased in 2006!  Update warranty ran out could not afford to trade it on on another car and the catalytic converter went bad and needed to be replaced!  Buick and GM is going down the drain!!!

Even 5 years later we still get compliments on it is looks . Not long after we had it ,the engine started making a horrible noise. We found out there was a recall on the timing chain . Our local dealer took care of it and Buick provided us a rental car for the entire time . We have had our local Buick dealer provide all scheduled maintenance on it . Again after a year the noise came back and again the timing chain needed to be replaced.  While still under factory warranty GM took care of it . Soon after our factory warranty ran out. Regretting that we did not purchase a extended warranty. Since our last GM cars have been great and with no issues .Now after 34000 miles our transmission went out and had to be totally rebuilt.  Luckily Buick was able to cover 60% of the 3400. dollars that it was going to cost us . Now I am concerned about the reliability of this car and considering trading it in .  Since it was a chilly night my wife and I both turned on our heated seats . We soon found out that the heated seats quit working . Then my wife went to move the power seat forward and we heard a grinding noise and the gears underneath the seat stripped out . I am convinced we now have a lemon . We are very disappointed since we both like the car but do not trust it anymore. With less than 35000 miles on it. We a now very concerned.

buick,regal,2011,zorrolives, 08/31/2011,Regal Turbo TO7,3,"Excellent Build quality, lacks mid range torque, say above 45mph, not enough kick when asked,
however low end is fine and improves greatly when tap shift manual mode is used.

Biggest complaint is overly firm seats and no adjustment for lower back, (always trying to back it off but default sticks out way too far, should be able to adjust to make it flat. Also if you try and raise the seat up it wants to scissor closed, Germanys revenge perhaps? I do get alot of compliments on the exterior design, was asked if that was a Audi the other day."
buick,regal,2011,newregal, 07/23/2011,Better than expected,5,I now have nearly 700 miles on my new Regal and love everything about it. I'm especially glad that it was made in Germany. They know how to do it. The ride is excellent and the features are outstanding. I traded in a CTS and consider that trade a step up. The blue dash lighting has a soothing effect. It has adequate power and is just plain out fun to drive. I can't think of anything that they could improve on. The exterior styling is cutting edge and the interior is surely REGAL. Thanks Buick for getting it right. Would definitely recommend this automobile.
buick,regal,2011,cbbll, 02/12/2013,What a buy!,5,"I was looking for something with better gas mileage, stylish, and relatively roomy. I looked at several differnt options and never thought I would consider a Buick. When I drove this car, it instantly reminded me of our 09 Audi A4 with the way it handled. Of course, the acceleration doesn't quite compare, but it can still move right along. The black on black is very sharp and as a young professional, my friends and co workers laughed at me when I said I bought a Buick. That was until they saw the car. Now everyone wants to drive it!"
buick,regal,2011,1487, 12/28/2010,31 year old owner,4,"I guess I will be the first to offer comments after 5k miles and nearly 6months of ownership. Thus far there haven't been any real issues. The only ""problem"" I have is that the horn doesnt sound when the doors are locked even though I have that setting selected in the DIC. I haven't been back to the dealer yet. The ride and handling are excellent as is the build quality on this car. Love the H/K stereo and the excellent MP3 integration. I really thought I was going to miss the lack of CD changer but with so many other options its no big deal. The backseat is tight for adults but OK for kids. The styling garners lots of compliments from strangers- even people in traffic. People love the looks"

I have over 2,000 miles on my new Regal and both times with manual calculations at the gas pump I've had over 36 MPG.
The fuel economy is excellent and happily unexpected.
Of course, most miles were highway.

My teenage son said the back seat was very comfortable - more so than the 2001 Buick Regal that we traded in.

While on the road at a rest area, I had a couple comment that they had been following me for miles trying to check out my car.
People I don't know have given me praise.
This is great.
Thank you Buick!

Even though this car was manufactured in Germany, I suspect that the engineering was all American (perhaps Michigander - Minded)."
buick,regal,2011,ajkiniowa, 10/19/2015,Euro Car Snob Goes Domestic,4,"This car is really an amazing value and design.  My Buick was made in Germany.  In the rest of the world it is an Opel Insignia which has been a European Car of the Year several times.  I also drive a Volvo, which in my opinion, has the best seats of any car maker - hence I can't laud the Buick's seats.  They are comfortable and I can drive for hours without any discomfort.  
The technology takes a bit of time to learn.  If you can read a manual, watch a DVD and Google you can learn these electronics easily.  I DO NOT like the electric parking brake!  Call me old school, but I would be happy to have a mechanical interface return.  
In emergency maneuvers, the car rivals any vehicle I have owned - BMW, Volvo, Audi, Saab, etc.... In some ways it is even better with the Stabilitrak stepping in to direct the car accordingly and allow one to avoid potential accidents without relying on anti-lock braking.  The brakes are also stellar.
The interior is exceedingly quiet.  I have found myself speeding more in this vehicle then probably any other I have owned.  It handles well and in Sport mode is very tuned in and fast.  
The headlights are also incredible - almost like daylight.  I also want to praise the Harman Kardon sound system, quite amazing.
I think driving the car will speak for itself.  As a certified vehicle there have been no maintenance or out of pocket costs and my local dealer is super.

I drove it into the dealer today and handed them the keys with 12 months left to go. Buick gave me all the excuses in the world save for finally sending out an engineer on the seventh try. I risked my life and that of my family's but not anymore. signed a lease for a 2013 Honda Accord. "
buick,regal,2011,furys, 08/15/2012,Self Accelerates,2,"In spite of my Regal being a German made car, I
am not a troll, competitor, or foreigner. I actually drive this 2011 Buick Regal Turbo in Denver. We paid a whopping $28K with a sticker price of $33K in July 2011. The dealership we purchased this car from, GO Buick Park Meadows, refuses to repair it. GM sent a third party specialist to verify the problem last month and we have yet to hear back from Buick.

Yes, I put my right foot on the brake when starting the car. It randomly self accelerates when in park, reverse or drive. The dangerous acceleration problem persists. Sadly, my family just can't continue driving this dangerous car. Post if you have the same issue with your new Buick Regal."

I have taken it to the dealership several times, but of course, they can't hear it.  I asked them to check the air conditioning unit, because when I turn the a/c off, the noise stops. Apparently if it doesn't show up in the computer, they won't do anything.  I just want to know if anyone else has experienced this.  By the way, I love my Regal, but the noise bugs me."

Despite all the negative comments about the base Regal being slow, my Regal with its turbo engine and manual transmission is not. I can only compare it to my BMW, but the Buick feels fastermarkedly so. I do not consider myself an enthusiast"", but I want a car with a manual tyranny that could get up and go when the situation required it.
My new Regal fits the bill very very nicelyand its rated at 32mpg "
buick,regal,2011,82oldsroyale, 05/23/2012,I Love this Car!,4,"I needed a car because I had an accident with my 02 Buick Park Ave. I did not consider the Lucerne, as this car was out dated already. I did look at the LaCrosse and feel in love with it, but it was out of my price range. So I looked at the Regal. At first I did not like it, I had issues with the size of the interior. Once I got over the initial size and became more open minded for what the Regal had to offer, I fell in love with it. The exterior styling is so sporty and the interior has so many standard options. The 2.4 engine takes some getting use to, but gets the job done. I just love driving this car! I love the stares I get when I pass people by!
People cannot believe it is a Buick!"
buick,regal,2011,gdeshields, 03/31/2011,Nice Car,4,"I traded my 2008 Pontiac G8 GT (Lease) for the 2011 Buick Regal (2 weeks ago), big change in power (8 cylinders) to (4 cylinders) but, how often did I really use it.

The BIG win is the car's quiet interior great sound system and gadgets galore Navigation, voice recognition, On Star, Hard Drive (the best--- you can record only the songs you like), and Bluetooth. Each day I find a new toy to play with, I expect to enjoy this car for the next 24 months.

By the way with gas at $3(plus) the mileage and cash savings will be a nice change."

On a family members' suggestion, (I was trying to laugh it off) they suggested the Regal.
This Regal shocked me...no ride noise at hwy speeds, unbelievable handling on the equipped 18"" tires, great styling (you really cannot tell its a Buick until you see the grille) and comfortable leather interior.
The lil 2.4 isn't a speed demon, BUT I am getting almost 29 hwy and 23 avg MPG and its a BLAST to drive.
A great value.

buick,regal,2011,jklag11, 11/26/2016,Solid Midsize Sedan Alternative,5,"Bought my used 2011 Buick Regal Turbo in 2015 with only 30k miles on it. Cost the same or less than comparable Ford and Honda midsize sedans with engine upgrades that I looked at. Overall really like the car, it has usable acceleration, good handling and ride (both important given the amount of driving I do over broken roads and maneuvering into parking garages), and is very sharp looking. Reliability and fit and finish have been excellent. Interior design is nicely done with high quality materials. On the long highway trips I've taken it on, I have been impressed with the quiet cabin and comfortable seats for long hauls. Cargo space is pretty good for a Only downside I have found is that it has mediocre city mileage and takes premium gas.

buick,regal,2011,JD from MA, 11/11/2010,American At Last!,5,"Like many other driver's in their late 30's looking for a new car, the search began on the other sides of the Atlantic and Pacific.  Except for the newer Cadillac CTS and maybe the new Lincoln MKZ, nothing state-side remotely sparked an interest.  I thought I had cornered the group of cars from which I would make my selection - - the usual suspects: Audi, Saab, Volvo, Acura and always in the mix, BMW.  Price was certainly a consideration; house, wife, two kids - you get the picture. It was then that I noticed an online ad for a new Buick Regal.  Buick? - I had one in High School.  I always thought to myself - why doesn't the U.S ever build cars like ...?  Maybe they just did. Check it out."
buick,regal,2011,Thomas, 06/11/2010,Much Better than I expected!,5,Beautiful inside & out. Excellent Ride & Crisp Handling. Sound system like being at a Live Concert. Better than a BMW at a fraction of the cost. Drive one first or you will end up paying a lot more.
buick,regal,2011,Tom H, 06/23/2010,Couldn't say no,5,"The moment I sat in the Regal I knew I would leave owning it.  The cocoa/cashmere interior is beautiful.  The exterior styling has a subtle elegance that doesn't draw a lot of stares, still I have had 3 people stop to ask about the car.  Mileage is about 27 combined and 31 Hwy.  Power is more than adequate for my needs.  7 speaker stereo sounds great. Very fun to drive with a refined ride. I drove the LaCrosse, but liked the smaller size of the Regal. Trunk size is larger than I expected.  The blue lighting of the dash is very pleasing at night.  I look forward to driving it to work in the morning and home in the evening. "
buick,regal,2011,valerie, 08/02/2010,My new 2011 buick Regal,5,I picked up my new car 2 days ago.  I have to say it is more than I expected. There are no buttons to unlock the rear doors; you will have to read the manual to figure this one out.  I also wish GM would build cars with the fuel door on the drivers side.  But that didn't stop me from my purchase. The interior is nicely appointed and the seats are very comfortable.  I have the stone metallic finish which seems to change color depending on the available light. I think the finish and exterior trim are exceptional. Plenty of engine for the size car. Brakes well too. The transmission is adequate and shift a little rough at low gear.  My Saturn shifted smoother.
buick,regal,2011,George, 10/21/2010,GM does it right this time!,5,"Bought a Regal RL1 in July to replace a 2005 Saab 9-3.  GM didn't do a good job Americanizing the Saab, but it has done an outstanding conversion of the Opel Insignia into the Buick Regal.  Currently built in Germany, the Regal has outstanding design details, workmanship, and reliability.  I have the dark blue exterior, cashmere interior which is really a gorgeous combination.  Love the comfortable leather seats, dual climate controls, quiet ride and sporty handling.  And even the little things like the power up/down on the passenger seat and the ability to customize the locking system, e.g. I choose to open all doors with one click of the remote instead of two."

I located a Certified Regal with 2500 miles on the odometer and fully loaded with options - and built in Germany!
Now that I am settling in with my new car, I can honestly say that it is a beautiful automobile.
The cabin is very comfortable and quiet, the engine has plenty of power, and it is fun to drive.
Despite being FWD, I find little difference in handling from the AWD Audi.I have the 6-speed Automatic which is a grand transmission - it always seems to be in the right gear and the shifts are very smooth.
Fuel mileage is comparable to the Audi."

It reminds me a lot of my BMW but it is cheaper and a lot better equipped, even for the base model. I'm really surprised I hadn't heard more about this car. Be sure your dealer throws in the cap reduction cash for owners of different makes. Will check in with a later review when it has more miles, but Buick is clearly not your father Buick anymore."

I tell you when I get in this car it makes me feel wonderful, its not to small but not big either, I looked at the Lacross it was much to large for me my children are all grown and on their own so I told the dealer it fit me and my purse just fine.

I first saw the new Regal on the road and in advertisements. The sporty exterior really appealed to me. I then did some research and saw how many great features came standard with the car. I got an RL3 for $27K MSRP (less with dealer incentives). The car is stylish, fuel efficient, has a beautiful leather interior (with power adjustable front seats and seat warmers), rear parking assist, dual climate control (with vents in the back seat area too), integrated blue tooth, XM, and iPOD docking station. The On-Star is pretty cool too. I now enjoy my commute!"

She finally decided to look at the Regal and really liked it.
It had all the perks of her BMW Plus.
She drove the 2.4 and was satisfied with it.
Then the saleman suggested she drive the turbo version and she was hooked.
Car is fun to drive, plenty of power and gets slightly better gas milage than her 3 Serries.
Is a little bigger but she loves all of the extras.
Very happy with her decision."

It's not the quickest car ever made (by far), but for an around the town type of car mixed in with a few road trips it's very solid.
It's more than made up though with the solid feel of the car.

buick,regal,2011,Newton Farmer, 11/11/2015,Fun Car,5,"This is a fun car to drive.  It would be great if it had a little more horsepower.  However, the 4 cyl. turbo has enough kick to be fun, and the sport transmission setting stiffens the handling enough to give the car a 'Corvettish' feel and like you are driving more than a family sedan.  The gas mileage in town is average probably because I like to ""goose it"" for the thrill of the turbo kicking in.  However, the trip mileage is phenomenal at easily 30+ mpg.  The back seat room is a tad small and the car sits really low.  However, I knew this going in and like the low slung look with the stock, wider than average tires.  The only real gripe I have about the car are the dash gages.  They are set back fairly deep in their chrome housings and maybe the lenses are not angled as well as they should be.  These issues result in either too much glare or shadows too dark to read speedometer and everything else on bright, sunny days.  I keep dash driver data screen set on MPH during the day so I can tell how fast I driving.  The glare/shadow issues are really that bad.

buick,regal,2011,John H. Wilde, 08/23/2016,Good ol' Bruno,5,"This is not most people's idea of a Buick. Our chocolate brown Regal turns heads! When I loaned it to my daughter co-workers asked her if she'd found a sugar daddy. Even my teen aged granddaughter's friends said it looked like a good ride. But the Regal is more than just a pretty face. Seats are long distance comfortable, and the passenger seat has lumbar support, something that a lot of pricier cars don't have. (Wake up Lacrosse.) The interior is tastefully elegant. Fit and finish are excellent. Quiet, especially in regard to wind and engine noise, firm but comfortable ride that keeps driver alert. Handles nicely. Engine is adequate for my needs. Good brakes. Easy on tires. Reasonable gas mileage if I drive conservatively. I didn't know how to answer the questions on technology since I don't give a flip about navigation, Bluetooth etc. I don't even use cruise control. As for entertainment, I hardly ever turn of the radio. I'd prefer a manual emergency brake, but I can live with the electric unit. Few complaints. Visibility could be better, the headrests are too big and exterior mirrors too small. And I'm thinking of installing a backup camera. Rear obstacle sensors are useless. For some reason it's hard to keep the exterior clean. Back seat is a bit cramped for anyone over 5'10"". I can't understand why this car doesn't hold its value. I've owned over 85 cars, starting with a 1929 Model A Ford, and I'd rate the Regal in the top five.

buick,regal,2011,Stephanie B, 10/03/2016,Never Again will I purchase a buick,2,"So I purchased my 2011 Buick regal at bergstrom in Oshkosh, WI. on Aug. 16th 2014. It was my first car and I fell in love with it. Not even a few weeks later I started having problems and a lot of recalls. My AC was broken and had gotten fixed. Now it has this terrible smell to it and i cant turn on the heat or the AC while in parked or when i am stopped somewhere because then my engine will make this terrible loud noise that sounds like its gonna break down. Also my trunk broke less then a year of having it so i was having to use my remote car key until that also broke too so now i cant get into my trunk anymore. My key ignition is also broke and keeps making a dinging sound when i have my door open even when my keys are not in there. I've had to have my car towed so many times for my computer shutting down and having to be restarted and another time finding a lot of water in my fuel tank. Then driving around and my car is always making noises and doesn't want to accelerate. But my main problem here is that when I'm driving my car it will completely lose power on me and shut off. I've had it happen 3 times so far and 1 time i was driving 65 in the middle of the night when i lost power, my steering wheel locked up and all my lights shut off and didn't want to start back up. I was so scared i was going to get hit luckily a few minutes later it came back on. I told GM about this the 1st time and they said they fixed the problem it was also under warranty at that time. A few months later the same thing I took it in and they said that my warranty ran out and they need to replace the pistons and the head gaskets and pretty much replace the whole engine which was gonna cost me a few grand. They said my car is burning through so much oil way more then it should be so i had to have them document it so they could send the documentation to GM so they can cover some of the cost since my warranty just ran out but then after all of that they said its burning way more oil then it should be but it still says its up to GM standards i couldn't believe it what a joke. I've also had so many more problems with this car and its costing me so much money. They wont do anything about this until i die in an accident. I am so scared to drive this car but i have no choice i still have 4 years to pay it off and i cant afford to trade it in. I just wish GM would take care of their mistakes. All i know is that i will never buy a GM vehicle ever again.

The new Regal that I now have rides, handles and is quieter than all of them.  The engine is a little underpowered but cruises down the highway @ 75-80 mph with no problem.  The transmittion shifts are smooth and quick. The seating is very supportive and comfortable. Controls for the radio and cruise control are easy to use.

buick,regal,2011,Samuel Christen, 12/23/2017,Great sport sedan for the money.,5,"My only real gripe re this car is entering and exiting my 77 yr old 6-2 frame in and out of it. Reminds me of my days during Vietnam squirming into a Navy fighter. This Buick is fast, powerful, quiet, rides well and has all the bells and whistles. Acceleration with the turbo will blow most other cars away. Shifting by the Auto transmission could be smoother, and I did not care for the ""auto-manual"" mode available by slapping the gear selector sudeways. The car is VERY quiet at speed on the highway, I recommend using cruise control so you do not creep up to 120 mph like I did once in Arizona. Love the different suspension modes available, and the premium sound system is great. To match this Buick, you would have to pay much more for a European sports sedan---don't!

It has also just quit working, requiring On Star to reset the computer. Though nothing can be found at the dealer, several excuses have been offered. We drove several different Regals while test driving and one of those did the same thing but we thought it might have been us, well it wasn't. The car doesn't down shift while slowing down so when you go to accelerate there is a long pause (very long). The bad part is you never know when it will do it which will lull you into a false sense of security.

The only way to buy this car is with the Turbo 2.0, which feels about right; the 2.4L is disappointing.
Light steering but you get used to it.
Some turbo lag from a dead-stop, and when you punch it you get to watch Instantaneous-MPG show 3 for a few seconds. Again you get used to it.
Quiet and smooth but the ride gets choppy over bumps or RR tracks.
Handles nice, but those who have also driven a BMW will not confuse the two.

buick,regal,2011,waxahachiejoe, 01/28/2014,Great car - so so navigation - repairs already?,4,"Bought my 2011 Regal used with 18K miles on it.
The car is great, and way more fun to drive than I thought.
My navigation keeps resetting the time to an hour ahead, no matter how many times I set it. The navigation thinks I live in DC.
I even paid for the $200 nav update disk and still the same.
No traffic updates and no blue tooth streaming.
I would not have bought this car had I known how horrible the nav is.
The driver's heated seat does not work, and the auto a/c is way off. I have to set it to 80 degrees to get warm and 70 to cool off.
I'm hoping a visit to the dealership will fix these issues but I shouldn't have to with 18K miles on it. "
buick,regal,2011,don_83, 04/09/2011,Same thing what they did with the monaro,4,"I gave the Regal turbo and CXL a very extended test drive and here are my impressions. Its a very comfortable car with decent mpg for daily commuting. Its not a sports sedan and the steering doesnot give you any feedback and its not weighted properly. Turbo has super light steering. Interior materials are good quality and this is something you dont expect from American cars, but the thing is built in germany so go figure. I still feel that GM has done some heavy cost cutting on the Opel to sell it in the U.S for mid 20s. you get a whole lot with the CXL model but its a little on the slow side. This car leans towards the camry side of the spectrum than the kizashi. "
buick,regal,2011,jackiern13, 05/24/2010,An absolute joy to drive,4,"Purchased car 10 days ago and absolutely in love! It's beautiful inside and out - nothing in its class can compare. The ride is smooth and classic Buick, but the steering and peppy engine is all sport! The interior is classic with supple leather and well designed dash. Very quiet to outside road noise. Mine came with the RL5 package - I think there is a RL6 package that would add navigation, but otherwise the car is loaded. Plenty of room in the backseat for passengers and the trunk has plenty of storage with fold down rear seats for extra room if needed. You have to drive this car before deciding to purchase an Acura or Lexus - I don't think they can compare. "
buick,regal,2011,Eldon, 06/16/2019,Not reliable,1,"You will have to replace the engine more than once and just pray that nothing goes wrong and you have at least the amount of money you paid for the car to fix it. I also have had to replace the starter more than once and my whole car needed rewiring. This is what happens when you have American cars being built overseas. The alternator was bad and barely had enough length for the connection.

When I went to take a look, it was love at first sight.  Looks even better in the flesh than in pics.  Engine has a nice growl that makes the TSX sound somewhat wimpy.  It also feels much more substantial.  "
buick,regal,2011,Steve, 07/08/2010,Not your Grandfather's or Father's Buick,5,"I'm pleasantly surprised with all aspects of this car.  I was looking at Acura TSX and gently used RL, Volvo S60, Audi A4/VW CC and used BMW 3 series.  There's plenty of room for 4 and their stuff.  The trunk seems bigger than all other cars I shopped.  Feature for feature, it was by far the best value. Seats are supportive and very comfortable, took a 500 mile trip and averaged 31 mpg, including some stop and go traffic.  An excellent consideration for those shopping entry level luxury cars in the under $40K class."

The gas mileage is good -- 27 mpg with combined city and highway driving including vacation highway miles.  Also, the car is a nice combination of sport and classic styling. It has been turning a few heads. The interior styling includes leather seats and an upgraded stereo system. It seems like a smaller version of the LaCrosse inside (no skimping on style).  I looked at Audi, VW, and Mazda and chose a Buick. Very happy with this purchase. "

The interior quality was impressive to say the least. On par with the CC which friends of mine currently own. Backseat was larger than expected and on par with current car. Trunk was deep and well finished. Car was extremely quiet and handled well. Acceleration was adequate as one would expect for a non turbo four cylinder. 
buick,regal,2011,Bill, 08/05/2010,Mini Cadillac,5,I have had the car for almost a month now and I love it.  Was driving a 2004 Pontiac GP.  What an upgrade!  The quality inside is as noticeable as the styling outside.  It not a race car but the power is adequate thanks to the transmission.  The six speed transmission always finds the right gear unlike the six speed in my Acadia.  Highly recommend this car if your budget is <$30K.  I owned a Cadillac STS before and this feels like a mini version of that car.

Great salesman and price on the Buick from a great dealer.
The old GM is dead and good riddance.


This car handles better than my M-B, gets better mileage and is much quieter plus corners better.
Have 600 miles on it and 25 mpg for 60-40 highway/city mileage.

I sold it after 4 1/2 years being a really reliable car. So I bought another Buick. But the Lucerne was rather big for my garage and I am usually driving alone or with my wife, so I do not need the huge legroom
the back. I wanted a smaller car and lthe Regal looked nicer than the LaCrosse. I also liked that it had firmer seats. And I got a great deal, so I bought it now. I choose the non-turbo version as it is fast enough (my wife has the same engine in her Chevy SUV) and it is more economical."
buick,regal,2011,cobra1365, 08/27/2011,Very Happy,4,"Picked up this car to replace my wife's 05 Pontiac G6 GT.
Wow, what a difference!
The car is incredibly quiet and smooth. Great styling, handling and build quality. Lot's of leg room!
I'm 5'11"" and if I run the power seat all the way back, I can't reach the pedals! Very satisfied so far.
Only cons...around town mileage is not as good as the G6 was, a slight hesitation at tip in (just as you depress accelerator), and the trim piece just above the glove box is too shiny...the angle puts a sunlight reflection right into the driver's eyes and the Bluetooth keeps losing sync with my wife's iPhone 4.

I can safely say this is the biggest car buying mistake of my life. To say that this car is a dog is an understatement. The best I can get for MPH is 20.5 and I consider myself a conservative driver. Passing other cars? Forget about it! Only downhill with a tailwind. An hour in the seat is the most I've ever made it without a break as the lumbar support, even when all the way back, feels like a gun being stuck in my back.

I identified this problem as dangerous and the vehicle seemed unsafe to drive.

The vehicle nearly stalls when entering the freeway and passing. We want to return the car because it is unsafe to drive with random self acceleration, a defective driver side windshield washer sprayer and defective mats that unclip while driving.

Not really good in the snow especially in VT this year. Dash board lights reflect on windshield at night also.

After just two weeks, I am very impressed with the looks of the vehicle and the way it drives.
There is plenty of room in the cabin, seats are very comfortable and the vehicle handles the way a German built car should.
My initial fuel mileage is better than the Audi as well.
I have now owned this car for 2.5 years and it is, without question, the best car I have ever owned.  Although I had a few minor items that needed fixing under the warranty, the car has cost little to keep on the road.  The car is fun to drive and very comfortable on long trips.  I am very pleased overall.
Update: 4/17/2017:  I enjoyed my 2011 Buick Regal so much that I traded it in and purchased a 2013 RegalGS, which, after owning for 3 months, is a spectacular vehicle.  My recommendation is that the 2011-2017 Regals are a wonderful car for the money.
At 3 years of ownership the Regal continues to impress me. It drives like a new car, costs very little to maintain and is still a sharp looking car as compared to any sedan on the road. Great car!

The adjustable suspension between
Comfort, Sport, and GS mode make each drive a new experience.


This car may not have the ""Grand National"" engine, but the turbo 4 cylinder with 270 hp with the automatic transmission provides the feeling of endlessly smooth quickness.
This car will get away from you quickly.

buick,regal,2012,Josh, 07/22/2015,Fantastic Driver with some Shortcomings,2,"I purchased this car over a year ago to replace a 2010 Mercury Milan Hybrid that had recently surpassed 100,000 miles. I wanted something that would be fun to drive and that had a manual transmission.  This car checked (most of) the boxes for my needs, after a year with it, however, this will be my last GM for a while.

The good: The turbocharged motor and manual transmission combination is great! Clutch and shifts are smooth and engage easily. The torque band is very wide and pulls the Regal up to (and over) legal highway speeds, quickly and quietly. The interior is quiet and comfortable around town and on long trips. 

The bad: Trying to use/figure out the buttons on the steering wheel/center console/touch screen is miserable and very confusing.  Voice recognition only works for certain functions, much worse than the SYNC in my previous car.  No rear-view camera, on a vehicle at this price point trying to compete with entry-level luxury cars, a rear-view camera should be standard.  The graphics for the navigation are acceptable, at best. QUALITY (or lack thereof) - my car has been in the shop 6 times in the past year for small repairs, blower motor on the climate control randomly cuts out, 4 rear light bulbs (no access panels in trunk, have to remove carpet surrounding the trunk to replace), sun visor mirror cover shattered apart, and grommets holding the floor mats to the floor sprung apart.   The plastics on the interior feel cheap and look cheaper.  The lack of storage space for front seat occupants is disappointing. 

Buick has done a fantastic job with the styling and the performance aspect of this car.  It looks and drives fantastic, now if there was more focus placed upon quality and interior components, I'd be fully satisfied.  I'm glad I purchased the Regal, but I'm ready to get into something else.

Update: 7/23/2016; 67,000 miles. The car continues to disappoint. I've now been through 6 sets of brake pads/rotors (it's a stick shift, I rarely brake hard). Several more tail light bulbs have burned out. The check engine light is on and the car is trying to stall out upon every shift. There's zero power upon acceleration despite the turbo engaging. 

I've actually sought out and bought another 2010 Milan because I hate this car so much but owe too much on it to get rid of it. This will definitely be my last GM product for a long time.

Update: 1/25/2017; Still own this heap due to being underwater (thanks GM depreciation).  Up to 75k miles - problems mentioned above were fixed at least GM extended the warranty and covered the issues (exhaust gas sensor, cam sensor, and a couple of other misc. issues).  Recently got approved for a personal loan to finance the negative equity - can't wait to sell this car.

At first I liked the Buick much better, but, as time went on, problems made themselves evident. The engine was quite powerful but, in spite of the much-hyped HyPer strut front suspension, torque steer was very pronounced under hard acceleration. In addition, the driver's seat, although comfortable on short jaunts, became a source of torture on long highway runs. The bottom bolsters seemed to be too tight, causing intense hip pain. In addition, the three driving modes (normal, Sport and GS) seemed to have little effect on performance, although the letter did stiffen the suspension significantly. The controls also feature a plethora of pushbuttons."

Now, the issues: first, the mileage for the eAssist hybrid I have is WAY overstated - I drive 70% highway and never get more than 24 MPGs. Lack of power and harshness in non-Turbo engines is noticable. Quality control still has a way to go, e.g. paint flaws & loose trim. If I had gotten the turbo or GS, I'd rate it a solid A. With the hybrid, B+. "
buick,regal,2012,sa_greg, 01/02/2015,"Needs AWD, and better Infotainment controls",3,"Love the exterior looks and wheels. I chose this over an Audi A4 Avant Quattro (wagon). My choice was based on (#1.) cheaper oil changes and overall maintenance costs vs. Audi's $250 oil changes, (#2.) more horsepower/torque over Audi, (#3.) more aggressive look than Audi, and (#4) Not too many GS models on the road = kind of  exclusive.
Love the car but sacrificed the pre-requisite of an All-Wheel-Drive car (Audi) for the horsepower / looks in the GS.  The almost uncontrollable torque steer is annoying & almost embarrassing when you want to stomp on the gas.
Also, very upset that I can't stream Pandora to Samsung Galaxy S5. Have to resort to using Aux input. Cheap interior materials."
buick,regal,2012,kmw8770, 07/30/2012,Couldn't Be Happier,5,"First new vehicle. I have been watching this vehicle from the point it was in the prototype stage, and when they entered production I knew I had to get one. White Diamond, 6-Manual, 20's, Brembos, LED/HID Headlamps, Intellilink System, Sunroof. Car is loaded. Has an unbelievable amount of power for a 2.0L and the six speed manual makes it a joy to drive. Not to mention the car handles incredibly and even with the 20's and low profile tires it rides very smooth. Personally I have had a slew of GM cars and those manufactured in Oshawa, ON Canada have always had the nicest paint and most solid build quality; this Regal certainly holds up to that standard.
Love this car. Take it for a test!"
buick,regal,2012,saegc7, 07/11/2013,"Doesn't stand for ""Granddad's Slowpoke""",5,"While this isn't a GNX or T-Type of the late 80's, this Buick ROCKS! The 2.0L engine is suprisingly powerful. It doesn't knock your head back with mad torque; instead the power builds quickly and will get away from you fast if you're not careful. I average 30-34 mpg daily and have a 17 mile commute to work which 14 is highway. 

I get away with midgrade fuel and get better gas mileage than with premium. I would do better if I could get away from the ethanol gas stations. The seats are very comfortable and visibility is great out the windshield. The rear view, is a different story. The rake needs a greater angle or a rear view backup camera. Overall, a great sporty car with decent power."

Recall, wheel bearing going in less than 60,000 miles and the dealership could never fix the problems with the front seat.  Brought it in 5 times and it never worked right.  I had problems with the lumbar support, when they fixed that the seat heater didn't work.  Brought it back and they said it was fixed but it still didn't work.  Each time I brought it in I had to make a new appointment so they could ""send it out.""  Long story short the dealership could not make it function and GM would not let me take it anywhere else since eventually the warranty expired.  This will be my last GM for a while.  By the way, once I sold the car I could still open locks, start vehicle, etc. since it was still connected to my smart phone.  Beware the ""internet of things"" and whatever you have connected to the internet.  This is a big security risk of these vehicle.

My car was in the shop 4 times for the turbo going out, once to have both axils replaced, once it left me stranded because the battery cables fried, once because the radiator ruptured, once because the windshield washer blew, once because all the brake lights went out and once for the center council and sun visors braking.
Half of all these problems occurred within my first two months of ownership.

buick,regal,2012,Gary, 05/13/2019,My good ol Buick,3,"Bought this car in January of 2015 at little over 38,000 miles. Now I have over 97k miles after 4 years of owning the car.                                                                                                                                The good: The car is pretty comfortable on trips of about 1 to 2 hours but any longer and I find myself attempting to find a comfortable setting for the lumbar support. The acceleration is actually really good, you can spin out the tires and it even accelerates well at higher speeds. It’s very nimble in corners and has a decent 0-60. The heated seats are a dream in the winter. Driving in the winter is good just don’t go crazy. The stock tires are excellent they lasted until 2018 or 7 years since the car was oringally leased in Oct 2011                                                     The bad: As the car ages the issues with quality start to stand out. At 43,000 the left rear wheel bearing went out and by 80k miles all 4 bears have been replaced. I’ve had both the intake and exhaust actuators replaced, a compressor, and belt tensionor. Just had the struts replaced, about to do the shocks soon. Need sway bar endlinks. Parking brake switch replaced, and I need a new caliper. Spark plugs last about 30k to 60k miles, owners manual says replace at 150k but I needed them at 60k because they were mis firing so bad. Now they are mis firing again. Other than normal maintenance the car is ok, so if you get one that has over 70k make sure spark plugs are good, engine air filter, cabin air filter as well + all the fluids, and belt. All of the parts (the things I did get done) cost about 2k and the labor is about 2.5k. Most of the repairs are easy if you want to avoid paying labor.

The car does lack the power and would be much better as a rear wheel drive. I also wish the car had a more aggressive exhaust, the current exhaust is quite wimpy. Most people cannot believe this car is a buick and neither can I. I've only had a week now & I've put 450 great miles on the car because it is fun to drive.
I have the black on black with tinted windows & 20"" wheels, simply incredible look. The interior controls are a little confusing, I think I need to get my Ph.d to figure some of the controls out."

buick,regal,2012,Jonnyess, 03/25/2018,Where do I begin??!!,1,"This is my first ""American"" car in estimated 1M lifetime miles....Toyota, then Nissan, always had what I wanted to drive...6 speed, coupe, leather, sunroof  etc. Well, that all changed in recent years and I didnt want to splurge on an Audi simply because prefer a manual transmission. Doing some research on my next vehicle after my Altima Coupe turned into a money pit at 155k, I stumbled onto Buick and the redesigned Regal with its 6sp turbo. I did tons of consumer research before purchasing, and all indications were favorable.   Fast forward 2 years this week, and here's my laundry list: MPG has never approximated the published EPA estimates - Turbo lag is very pronounced in lower gears...-front axle and wheel bearing needed replacing at 30k (CPO warranty covered)  - trunk light fixture failed at 30K (not covered)...the GPS SD card fails intermittently, system reboot needed to recover...bluetooth will randomly disconnect from my Android, has actually completely redacted itself from the vehicle on 2 occasions...lack of rear camera is mind boggling at this price point (as others have mentioned)...the rear trunk will randomly fail to open, mechanism finally totally failed at 60k...the OEM carpeted floor mats are comically thin and low quality...the interior lights will randomly fail when opening car doors in a dark garage....the passenger visor tension rod failed at 40K, cannot be repaired: $120 for replacement. The drivers side seat heater has failed at 57k...the stereo IQ reverts to default settings once the car is turned off...

And the kicker: received 2 CEL codes accompanied by loss of power, white exhaust, rough idle at 50k...warranty had expired due to date of vehicle initial title...fuel injectors were replaced ($900) and dealer advised ""we spoke with GM tech support, and that white smoke from exhaust MAY be due to cracked piston...""  !!??  Received 2 different CEL codes within 24 hours, brought vehicle back to local dealer, {who was in the process of going out of business, but checked the vehicle}, advised gratis the problem was not the ""throttle body"" as indicated, and suggested I bring to another dealer for a deep dive. After 2 days, dealer called and advised I need new engine or complete rebuild, as there ""was no oil in pan...it was throughout the system"" and the exact cause simply could not be pinpointed. GM refused to extend the expired warranty, despite my arguments re low mileage, finally agreed to meet me halfway and the engine rebuild subsequently cost me $3300, on top of the $900 I had just spent on the initial problem. Unlimited mileage/12 mo warranty. The car now drives beautifully as one might expect after this type of spend. The handling and ride have always been top notch, and the design is clearly a head-turner. GM second-string engineering and failure to stand by their products are the ultimate problem here, and this will be my last purchase, especially with the stellar reviews on the redesigned Mazda6 turbos.

UPDATE: 40k later, engine runs beautifully. Recent major issue ABS module replacement, despite the fact that these were designed to last a lifetime of the vehicle from what I've learned. Discovered rear hub assembly also faulty and after the ECU reflash total exceeded $1,200. 

Vehicle now at 97 K I just cannot imagine what would lie ahead if I decided to drive into my typical 150k range. If GM finally stop swirling the drain and goes completely belly up during my lifetime I will certainly know why.

 the driving dynamics are awesome, the car handles all kinds of curves and road conditions excellently.
I honestly think GM should use the Hy-per-Strut in more vehicles as it gives you confidence, traction and very minimal torque steer.

The car was wonderful, it took care of my pregnant wife, drove across country 3600 miles in the summer averaging 27 mpg for the trip, (great while cruising 75-80 mph)

and still had plenty of power for passing when needed."

Need HID headlights and the Premium 2 trim level was required.
I researched and drove the Honda Accord Touring, Ford Fusion, Malibu 2LTZ, BMW 3 series, MB C 250, Kia Optima, and the Nissan Altima.
The Buick Regal surpassed all of them in comfort, features, ride quality, build quality, handling, luxury, and especially quietness.
A quiet comfortable car is paramount for me and the Buick Regal provides that at a reasonable price point.
I am completely impressed with this car.
Traded in my Cadillac DeVille, known for comfort and quiet, and have not regretted my decision.
The Regal is great."
buick,regal,2013,Grant, 05/24/2016,What a joy,5,"I own the Buick Regal Premium III and enjoy driving the vehicle.  The  2.0 Turbo provides power when you need it.  I get 20 MPG around town and 30 Mpg on the highway.  The handling is outstanding not like the old Buick;s that had the soft ride but handled like a brick.  I have owned Buick's over the years and this 2013 Regal  is so much nicer to drive. It has the feeling of a sports car  I have owned both a Mustang and Camero and I prefer the Regal over both of them.  The longer I drive the Regal the better I enjoy it.  I posted this review almost a year ago about my Buick Regal and I appreciate the quality of the Regal more with each passing year.  It has a style that makes it really standout when it is parked with other vehicles in the parking lot.  The interior is great and the leather seats are just as nice as they were when it came from the factory.  I have had leather in other cars and they wrinkled after only a couple of months, that is not the case with the Regal. There is so much more to like about the Regal that I could put in this review. Perhaps, I will expand my review if I get another opportunity.  My Regal continues to perform at a high level.  I plan to drive it for another year at which time I will purchase or lease another Buick. The longer i own my Buick the better I like it.  It is a car that I don't get tired driving.

They didn't fix it correctly.  Went the cheapo route.  evaporator needs full scrub down, they avoided that because i am sure its way involved and behind the dash.

buick,regal,2013,Mike Benninger, 02/24/2017,2013 Buick Regal 2.0 Turbo,4,"I purchased a 2013 Buick Regal Turbo Premium 1, with a sunroof and the chrome wheels for $16000.00 in January 2017. It had 5800 miles and was in showroom condition. We drove it to Florida and put over 3000 miles on it. I flogged it pretty hard going to Ft Myers, often exceeding 90 mph and rarely going under 80 mph. The car performed flawlessly. My overall mileage was 26.2 mpg according to the trip computer. On the way home I did one tank of gas without exceeding 72 mph and got 32.6 mpg. Very comfortable seats. Good performance. The ride was a little stiff but the handling was great. Lots of trunk space. The instrument lighting would sometimes stay in darkness mode making it very difficult to see the radio screen. The cup holder could not hold 2 large McDonalds cups next to each other without them leaning. I removed the cup holder liner and that helped, but it was still a problem. Like all cars now it takes awhile to understand all the electronic controls, but, compared to my wifes's Madza and a lot of my friends cars, it was relatively easy. I wish it had a backup camera, but, the backup alert system on the Premium 1 is pretty good. Beautiful car. A lot of car for the money.

buick,regal,2013,Sully Lang, 10/05/2016,"Fast, Fun and Luxurious",5,"Purchased our first 2013 Regal Turbo Premium I in August of 2015. Black on black was beautiful inside and out. My son got in a wreck, totaled the car at 67.000 miles, but not a scratch on him. Side curtain airbags worked perfectly. We went out and bought another 2013 Turbo Premium I in Graphite Blue Metallic with a light cocoa dune interior. My wife and I love this car (both of them). I travel for work and have opportunity to drive many other vehicles as rentals (Altima, Challenger, Mustang, Optima, Camry, Accord, and others) but this is still my favorite. Great performance, comfort, and style. In the first Regal I achieved as high as 36 mpg over a 50 mile stretch (by onbrd comp). Average highway fuel economy at 70 mph is about 29 mpg. Around town is about 19 mpg, and mixed driving is about 23 or 24. Even after owning for well over a year the performance is exhilarating.
2019 update-The blue Regal is still running awesome with zero maintenance issues. It was a CPO vehicle, and everything has been great. There were two or three issues that GM fixed for us free of charge. (Ext door lock release buttons on door, heated steering wheel, radio reflash). Small issues, yet note worthy if buying without CPO. We still love this car. If you need the fastest car on the road, look elsewhere. If you want a car that performs better than the average, is fun and comfortable, this is it!
Fast and fun, without the foreign car maintenance fees. This car is awesome!
We've owned a 2013 Buick Regal for 4 years now. My son totaled the first one, so we bought another used Regal. Still love this car. All problems were minor and resolved quickly at dealer (radio needed reprogramming, and heated steering wheel didn't work). Still impressed with the power to weight ratio for this car. Sexy, powerful, and fun. It's not the fastest car on the road, and it shouldn't be. I would purchase again. Great value for the dollar.

"
buick,regal,2013,Kassem Ismail, 08/09/2016,"Comfortable, Sleek, and elegant",5,"To start off, I would certainly like to say that for the money, Buick has done a marvelous job in owning up to the word luxury in this model. The seats hug you to eventually offer a simple release. The layout of the interior really makes up for the slight flaws found in the car. This would be my 3rd vehicle and previous owner to a Chevy HHR. The good definitely outweighs the bad with this car. The bad: one of the many terrible reviews on this car is the shiny chrome cover surrounding the gear shifter. Be careful, because at a stop light or pulling through a drive through a bright white reflection may beam you right in both eyes, causing you to cover your eyes (with dark window tints, not so much of the sun makes it into the car which is not so bad). I am 5'8"" and about 190lbs (I'm not too big of a guy), but getting into the car, sometimes I knock right into the lower part of the dash. Because I put my right foot in first and proceed to sit down, is maybe the tale tell sign of getting in the car wrong? But I tell you, if forgotten about, it can hurt like hell getting into the car. The acceleration has a bit of resistance also. Given that the car has adapted the eAssist concept of efficiency over power, I would say that its not a deal breaker. At times the media center in the dash can freeze/run slow/display the wrong information (which again, is not a deal breaker because it has happened maybe 5 times out of owning the car for 7 months). Of course not having much trunk space is a downfall. The battery from the eAssist takes up a quarter of the trunk which doesn't play out too well if you like to store lots of tire size objects in your trunk. The rear seats still fold down so that is a positive outlook on it. Speaking of seats, some of the threads are coming out of the leather in the back of the drivers seat, which has me baffled because neither I or the owner before are big guys. The pieces of leather are literally separating, giving a view of about 3 cm wide into the darkness of the inside of the seat. Also the matte material on the door panel (covering window switches and pieces on the steering wheel) have began to chip. I'm not sure what the previous owner did to start it, but it is not pleasing to the eye. The matte material is brown and under is black. So it really looks like the car is cheap when looked at closely. Luckily it does not flake up but only get bigger when scratched (which I assure you, will be kept to an absolute minimal). I am now done nit-picking every issue I have with the car. Honestly, isn't that much. Which is why I rated the car a 5* overall. All issues of mine are cosmetic (other than lack of acceleration, if I wanted power, I would've gotten a Dodge Challenger). I enjoy taking my Regal on a short drive to the grocery store or even hours away to a nearby city. The Regal hasn't failed me so far and has managed to slightly surpass my own first impression/standards of the car. I look forward for years to come with her.

It has that ""just right"" feel to it, in EVERY category.  The size is great, not too small, not too big.   Easy to get in and out of, front and back seats.  The trunk is big!  The 4 cylinder turbo gets really good mileage, but is strong enough to pin you back in your seat.  Sporty and strong describes this engine.  Pulls hard up to 100 mph.  The interior design is classy and tasteful and all the controls are easy.  Riding in this car makes you feel like you're in a much more expensive , luxury sports sedan.  It's ""Buick"" quite, but gives you the feedback you need to drive it hard.  The seats are nice and comfortable and there are no blind spots to speak of.  I'd put this car up against anything germany or japan have to offer and if they beat this car in any category, you can bet that it would be by one that cost $20k more than this Regal.

Lately, we've noticed some squeaking coming from the dash - it's not too bad yet, and we have put a LOT of miles on this car.  Next time she goes in for an oil change, I'll ask dealer to take a look/listen.
Dealer service department is A+ - Premier Autoplex in Livingston - couldn't be friendly or provide better service.  I don't take my vehicles anyplace but the GM dealer for servicing.  The price is in line with competition and they know their vehicles better (I've know people who've tried to 'cheap out' and ended up ruining their cars because their ""Average Joe"" mechanic didn't know enough about their vehicle to maintain/fix it properly).   

Like all GM vehicles, the Regal suffers from being 'unknown' and American.  So many people are devoted to Honda or Toyota that they won't even test drive other vehicles - and they lose out.  I am pleased every time I see, get in, or drive my Regal - it's just about the perfect car... Great gas mileage, excellent road manners, fast, comfortable (if you'll notice, we put on about 150 miles every day... we're in the car well over two hours every day, so comfort is important), very well equipped for a $30K vehicle, and reliable.  

Update: 4/2016
Well, it's been a year with my Regal and my first impression hasn't changed much.  It's still an awesome car.  As luxurious as my previous Cadillacs, but with a much easier to use instrument panel (real buttons!!!).  MPG is up to 28.5 - and I don't have a feather foot in any way, although we do a majority of our driving on the highway (about 150 miles, round trip daily).  
The only quibbles:  1.) The computer that senses the remote had to be replaced (under warranty) - it wasn't recognizing the fobs - worrisome in a car that was less than a year old;  2.) The interior has a few squeaks - not surprising with a sunroof, I guess, but there are some annoying buzzes that we can't locate.  
We still love the car's power, handling, braking, and of course, the outstanding fuel economy.  We routinely see over 30 MPG, average.  It's too bad this car doesn't sell better - it's one of the best vehicles GM sells, for that matter, any manufacturer.  It's a great buy, in my opinion. 


Original Review:
So, after five Cadillacs (3 STSs, and 2 CTSs), I decided to try the Buick Regal.  I liked the size and fuel economy (we commute 150 miles daily).  I couldn't stand the CUE interface in the Cadillac and was a little dismayed that the same basic system is used in the Buick.  I have to say, though, that it works much better in the Buick - there are hard buttons for the climate controls and radio - very nice.  The individual temp controls and seat heater controls are a weird touch-panel that doesn't work very well - Buick should have just used hard buttons like the rest of the climate controls. 
The front seats are very comfortable and there is plenty of room.  The center console is a bit small, as is the glove box, but this is a fairly small vehicle so I guess that's to be expected.  The back seat looks nice, but it also looks very cramped although my 5'6"" mom doesn't complain at all, even when she sits behind the driver seat (I'm 6'4"").   The trunk is spacious and the Premium I package includes almost everything my Caddy's had (except, alas, ventilated seats). 
Driving dynamics are great - she's fast, fluid, and agile.  Passing is a piece of cake, the brakes are monsters, and the ride is well-controlled (definitely not grandma's Buick).  The Navigation, like CUE and other GM products
 is flaky - we end up using our phones more than the car's nav.  Also, the split functionality (between the nav and the instrument panel) is a very strange design - sometimes the system initially 'finds' a destination, but then the navigation system cannot... routing is also terrible... more than once GM's Navigation systems have tried taking us down non-existent roads. 
Fuel economy is great for the size and performance.  The 2.0 Turbo is plenty powerful and we always use premium ""Top Tier"" gasoline.

buick,regal,2015,TD Heald, 03/09/2016,Underrated Sedan,5,"I have owned this car for 8 months and love it. It is very underrated by reviewers. My Buick Regal is a 2015, Premium II with some added features like sunroof. This car has outstanding acceleration while achieving overall 26 MPG. Driving comfort is fantastic with the most comfortable seats. Controls are well placed. I saw reviews mentioning the window button placement and heated seat buttons, these are overstated complaints and are non-issues. This car is sporty with the patented Buick smooth ride. Great road feel but with top of the line ride comfort. The car appearance is understated and classy. I love the front end grill. This car has all the bells and whistles you can ask for. Standard bumper to bumper warranty of 4 years, 48,000 miles. Buick dealer service is outstanding. When purchasing, dealer was willing to work with me on price. Excellent value. If you are looking for a quality mid size vehicle, you cannot go wrong. Compare to the overpriced BMW, Audi, Acura, Infinity, Lexus and you will appreciate the quality and value of the Buick.

buick,regal,2015,Karina Espinoza, 10/27/2015,"Good Car, but some Disappointments",4,"I'm about 8,000 miles into my 2015 Buick Regal (Premium II) class and I've had it for about 7 months now.  It drives really well and feels comfortable enough behind the wheel; However the interior has a few problems.  In order for me to access the window/lock buttons I have to contort my body a bit and bend my arm considerably (I'm 6' 1""), it's not natural.  Also, for me to access the storage console in the center, I have to reach back and put my body and arm in an awkward and uncomfortable position to open it... Basically, should not do this while driving as it can be dangerous.  My other cars allowed my arms to comfortably go off the steering wheel and to the window switch with ease rather than have to start bending and contorting... Same with the center storage console.

Visibility while backing up and changing lanes is not so good.  You really have to depend on the camera; However, the camera in my vehicle is too bright during the day and has poor detail, so it's not very reliable.

Finally, the ""Infotainment"" console has had some glitches in just the 7 months, which makes me feel it's just a matter of time before something goes bad:
1) Within 3 Months the temperature gauge stopped working consistently... it takes about 10 minutes to start gauging the right temperature outside.
2) twice I've entered my car to a loud buzzing sound that stopped once I turned the vehicle on.
3) twice I've pressed my ignition button and the car wouldn't wouldn't start (as if the battery was dying).
4) Several times when I've turned my vehicle on, the console has ""glitches out"" shut off and then turned back on.
5) Once, after reversing and going into drive, the parking camera stayed on for the entire time I was driving and never switched back to my radio/console view.
6) Many times I've adjusted the volume and it switched my radio channel instead.
7) When my front windshield gets fogged up, the ""defroster"" seems to not work AT ALL.  I've tried different combos of settings, but nothing seems to work.

I took it in once for a minor issue and told them about the issues and they said there was nothing they could really do about it yet.

buick,regal,2015,frenchguy007, 10/23/2014,Great drive,4,"Love the drive and the look, inside and out. Love that the seat warmers go on when remote start is activated. 

The one negative is the interior layout of the center console, too tight. There is limited storage room.

I describe this as a poor man's Audi A4."
buick,regal,2015,Mike Trainor, 07/24/2015,Jury is still out,4,"At only 700 miles, it is hard to judge a brand new car. So take that into consideration as you read this. And, it will be helpful to know that I was NOT shopping Buicks - at all - before I bought this. In fact, I wasn't shopping ANY car that had an MSRP more than $30K, and this Regal GS was stickered at nearly $41K. So what happened here?

I had been driving a 2012 Hyundai Elantra Limited and wanted a car with more HP & torque, better handling and more tech features. First looked at the new Elantra's - nope. Looked at Mazda 3s - nope. Cruze, nope. Mustang... well, not more than $30K so that was out of the question anyway. Not interested in anything Toyota had, nor Honda for that matter. Wife mentions Buick one day. BUICK??? Oh... yeah... the Verano! So, I decided on July 4 to shop them, not really expecting the dealer to be open. They were.

Before I knew it, I was test driving a Regal T premium, but didn't like the interior. Saavy sales rep finds a GS out back and convinces me to drive it. Sure, why not drive a freakin' $40,000 car!!! Anyway, to sum it up, I bought the thing. Not that day, but later next week. So, enough on how I got into this car, here's my summary review:
Overall:  4 stars because 3 wasn't enough and there's no 3-1/2. It IS a NICE car, but some things are missing.
Performance:  I don't have a great basis for comparison. Last ""fast car"" I drove was '74 Chevelle SS with a 454 v8. But... the Regal does move and moves quickly - once you get past the turbo lag. 
The acceleration and power curve are quite nice after that. At slower speeds, 25 - 35 say, it can hardly get out of its own way unless you put your foot into it. Steering and road holding I think I very good - feels solid, good feedback. BMW drivers might find it dull and lumbering, but for me, it is more than adequate and would not fear driving this car 120 mph. Especially because the Brembo brakes are confidence inspiring. 
What kinda sucks is the tranny when you shift on your own. I'm still learning where this car needs to be on the rpms, but it is SO quiet, and quick, that I didn't realize I was up to almost 4000 rpms and still in second. She didn''t like that very much. in more normal driving, ahem, I found while the shifts are smooth, there's no audible feedback from the engine. keep your eye on the rpm guage!! but... see... you need your eyes on the road and your ears on the engine. other than that, shifts fine and you can toss this car around pretty well. but she's heavy. this, of course, coming from being used to a featherweight Elantra. just driving as an automatic, shifts are smooth and about where you would expect, and want, them to be, even under heavy acceleration. 

Comfort-Interior -- For the money, she's quite comfortable. Seats are firm(er) in the GS model which has an upgraded seat and leather package, but they fit me well. The car fits me well in fact. I'm 6'0"" and about 180 lbs. The front is a bit narrow, but I still have plenty of elbow and hip room. Seats provide thigh support right where I need it. Headroom, even with the sunroof, is fine, plenty of clearance. Someone at 250 might not fit as well. Controls are all relatively well-laid out, similar in some ways to the Elantra, so i'm not having any issues in finding where things are, and everything is within easy reach. except two things.....
Nitpick alert! One negative about the interior design is where the window controls and outside mirror control are. In the Elantra, resting my elbow on the door grip in a comfortable spot at my side, my fingers fell right onto those, with only a slight reach forward to the mirror control. In the Regal, I have to bring my hand back almost a full hand-length and LOOK as to which button do I have, front window or back window?
I also find quite annoying where the door grip is. The interior features a nice swooshy grab bar in fake metal. it's okay to
 use when closing the door. but when opening it, the grip is a bit far forward, making an already heavy door even heavier because you're pushing it open too far forward. and here's the gotchya - there is no grip in the elbow rest part of the door, no place for your hand. Cheap, GM, very cheap.
As noted, this car is quiet. In fact, I've never been in a quieter car save for a fun little drive in an 80s vintage Rolls Royce. But also noted, that's a negative when it comes to hearing the engine, or exhaust.
Visibility is mostly okay, but out the back and over the shoulder are tougher. The B pillar is pretty wide... you'll quickly learn to use, and appreciate, the blind spot warning in the mirrors. Rear is smallish and narrow, but hardly an obstacle. The Mazda 3 hatchback was much, much worse.
As to instrumentation, well, there's a learning curve there, but it's all there if you want it, including oil temp and pressure, friction bubble (wha???), and a whole mess of other stuff. Not the easiest to use and could stand a bit more ability to customize, but I find it complete, easy to read.

I don't sit in the back, but it looks cramped.  This is a way better car than my 2006 SAAB 2.0LT 6M.  Larger, heavier and has a much higher level interior quality.  Overall a very well balanced car for the $ refined and pretty fast.  Twin Scroll turbo and 6 speed auto are well matched can feel the gears in smooth shifts.

buick,regal,2015,frenchguy007, 01/17/2015,Great car!,4,"Love this car, great value for the money. 4wd is what makes the difference in this segment, hard to find without spending much more. I have had 2 Legacy's before this, the brick is much more refined. Only issue is the touch controls for heated seats and temp control, they don't capture the contact if you wear gloves and even with bare finger the touch often requires several taps before it recognizes. It distracts the driver and is therefore dangerous.

But for function, comfort, safety and a bit of fun, I have only had one or two other cars that would challenge it for drivability. Another good criteria; would you buy this car again? I would because it is also very reliable, and has a ton of features to make it very flexible for the type of driving that I do.

buick,regal,2015,John S., 06/01/2016,4700 Miles in a Nine Days,4,"That's how many days and miles my wife and I spent in this rental car.  Overall, the Regal was powerful, very quiet, and comfortable on the road, with good storage space.  We averaged about 30 mpg overall, even getting 27 while going 83 mph through the West.  All is not well, however.  The shiny chrome on the gear shift lever can shine in your eyes badly enough to be a safety hazard.  The infotainment system was ""okay"" but the controls are poor.  Particularly irritating was the fact that every single time (!) you'd turn on the ignition, it would ""automatically"" (but not wanted) start to play either (a) Bluetooth songs from my wife's phone or (b) songs from the USB flash drive that I brought along.  Of course it was our own music, but we want to control when we play it, not the car.

We found a 2016 Regal Tii Premium II with low mileage at our local Buick dealer and took it for a test drive. We were immediately impressed with the obvious improvements in the Buick Regal Tii. We were amazed at the quiet and comfort and the added horsepower of the turbo was a great plus. The Bose stereo system, navigation, blue tooth, Wi-Fi and such and this feels like the car of my retirement dreams. An American brand car that looks better, maintenance affordable and better priced then most of the Audi, BMW etc. over priced foreign models. Thanks Buick for making the car that saved my life and our new best loved car, 2016 Buick Regal Tii.  JRGAR
 Fast forward to 2020. We still love this car. 40,000 miles now. No problems. Enjoying some some fast starts with the turbo is great. New tires now and will keep this car for another year. Hope to get a great trade in and buy a newer Buick Regal. JRGAR

buick,regal,2016,Mark, 08/22/2016,Better than my 2011,5,"I traded my 2011 Buick Regal in on this 2016 because I loved my  2011 so much.  My 2011 was not a turbo & it was a dark gray with black  interior.  My wife and I wanted a lighter color outside with a light color interior also.  We bought it in July 2016 when Buick was giving 20% off on certain  models.  We used our GM points from our GM card and the discount on the car listed for 31,000 we paid $23,300 for it. I could not pass up that deal up. The color was   Champagne Silver with cashmere  leather interior. I love the changes  &  improvements they have made since 2011.  My 2016 drives smoother and is quieter & the turbo engine is great. It is real easy to use all of the features this car has to offer. I can get in this car & drive it on a long trip & feel comfortable the whole time. This is only one the second Buick I have owened. I have been driving  since 1972 & have owened a lot of cars & trucks over the years both foreign & domestic.  We have 5 vehicles  now & the Buick is  by far my favorite to drive.

in less than 1500 miles--THE TRANSMISSION BLEW!  Now I don't want the repaired car- at

Then once I drove it was so quiet and nice and the acceleration for a 4 cylinder was amazing compared to the Equinox that I was driving before. My only complaint is the storage between the seats. When someone is with me there is no where to put my purse, or my dog who likes to sit on the console.  Getting in and out at first was a change for me from a SUV. But if you put the seat in the highest upward position it helps a lot. The trunk is amazing, more room than my suv by far. I would of liked to have the beeping on back up along with the camera, which I had before letting me know I am getting too close.  But it gets great gas mileage compared to my 4 cylinder SUV. I average around 26 MPG, with the Equinox I got 21. The leather is nice on the seats, it has a clothed material around the edge to keep the seats from cracking from ware like transitional leather seats. And the inside trim is accented with a nice chrome color.  The Touch screen is wonderful also.  I have about 7,800 miles on mine so far, acceleration still wonderful on it. Also the AC is nice and cold. I have a White Regal with Black Interior, the AC cools it pretty quickly as July has been a hot month. Also, this car is not for Middle Class and Retirees only.  The Regal 11 Sport has power. My teenage daughter Bought a Jeep Cherokee and loves to drive my Regal due to the acceleration and Sun Roof in mine.

because the air pump is going, but its just routine care. Not crazy about the lack of power, but it makes me drive slower (my wife is happier). Handled very well in the winter. Surprised that I don't need my truck every time I go to Lowes. Service Records did show that previous owner had trouble with intake. Not my dream car, but a nice cheap drive so far."
buick,rendezvous,2002,erickadam, 02/19/2012,LUCKY (I GUESS),3,"It has been a pleasurable 3 years; I bought this car at a buy here pay here lot with 99000 miles on it, and it has been great. NO PROBLEMS, jus the usual breaks, oil change, and tires (which could get expensive). 

If I were to say something negative I would probably tell you that it is a gas consumer. 

Car has no problems, but as some of the reviews here I guess I'm a lucky one. 

GREAT CAR!!!!"
buick,rendezvous,2002,Suena Olson, 05/14/2016,2002 Buick Rendezvous get additional waranty!!!!,3,"I have owned my Buick Rendezvous for almost 5 years.  The additional warranty has paid for the car and then some in repairs.  First day off the truck had 1000. tranny repair.  Dealership I got it from paid due to warranty requirements of 400 miles or 4 mos of ownership prior to claims.  I have had bad wheels, drive shaft repairs, differential problems, broken mirror, gas tank levels repairs, air conditioner condenser and compressor replacements,  multiple sensor replacements, and now it is going in and out of AWD by itself and the ABS light comes on.  I have never driven 10000 miles without a major repair.  It had 35000 miles on it when I bought it and only has 78000 now.  I am sure glad I have never sold the Honda Prelude it was supposed to replace because at 137000 miles, it still drives like new and apparently will be taking me to Montana in June because the Buick is back in the dealership for repairs once again.  I totaled this car and was uninjured.  It may have been the worst lemon of a car but it saved my life in the end.  Of course, I bought a Nissan and a Mazda when I replaced this car.

buick,rendezvous,2002,jerezaa, 04/12/2011,A Mistake,3,"Bought used but shouldn't have, Luckily I got the extended warranty because 2 months later the transmission went out (While crossing the Bay Bridge into San Francisco- what an adventure!) Took a month to fix. No trouble for a while but
then the something computer module which controls nearly everything went and it overheated. Spent tons of money to replace heads and the dealer (Covert Buick in Austin TX) and apparently they did not fix correctly. It's back in the shop after having it back for only 2 weeks. I should have just bought another car. The car is comfortable and I like driving it but it is the second worst car I've ever owned (The first worst was a Renault LeCar) Don't buy it!"
buick,rendezvous,2002,ssarason, 10/02/2011,Very happy with this car.,4,"We bought this car new in Dec 2001.
We have done regular maintanence.
The car now have over 195,000 miles and is still great to drive.
There were a few early repairs done under warrenty, but we have had few problems with the car.
Just the unual, tires, brakes, shocks, regular oil changes, etc.
I love driving the car.
It is very comfortable.
Even though the car in nearly 10 years old, many people thing is is still fairly new.
They are always surprised to find out it is a 2002.
So far the car has been very reliable.
I was hoping to see more positive reviews of the car. I can only think that those cars that have been a problem were not properly maintained. We are very happy with ours."
buick,rendezvous,2002,rendezastek, 03/13/2013,Still going,4,"I have owned my 2002 Rendezvous for 6 years now.
I bought the car for $6,500. in 2007 and up till a year ago hardly had an issue.
Last year I did do some engine work and this year replaced the transmission.
The transmission was due to a solenoid.
This is a common flaw in these transmissions.
Other than that hardly any repairs.
 I did also replace the wheel bearings this year.
 Hoping to get another few years out of it."

In 11 months the trasmision,air conditioning, fuel pump, body control module and the oxygen sensor has all needed work. With the total bills costing well over 5,000 dollars.

buick,rendezvous,2002,Jon, 08/22/2010,Must have bought the right one!,4,Purchased from a processional 1 owner couple @93k Fully loaded with tow package which was never used until me. I haul my lawn mower and a ton of pellets in Maine hills and windy roads. Only repairs where new brake pads and rotors. and rear self adjusting shocks which cost me $600 installed at a gm dealer. Much nicer then my Jeep grand Cherokee and Chevy Blazer and way nicer then any explorer ever made! gas mileage isn't bad about 18-22 cd player 6 disc didn't work when I purchased it. Time for a new odyssey though hope it sells fast it should the condition is nice and it has all the whistles. i am going to miss the heads up and heated seats!

Air conditioning went. Many service problems then last week it over heated and she pulled off the highway to let it cool down - It had to be towed and the head gaskets need to be replaced - Greenwood Chevy (Youngstown, Ohio) dealer says $1800 to replace - The car is money pit and is only worth about $2300. I would never buy another GM product again! ( Nor will she)  If I ever buy American again it will be a Ford; but we're leaning towards Honda!"

to the power of the 3800 and SC3800 
engines we are disapointed with the

Buick should have been used.

Its nice looking from the front but 
from the rear it isnt so great.

The worst problem is that in the past 
month we have had lots of electrical 
problems and will soon be on our 3rd

if we keep it we will be purchasing a 
GM extended warranty as we dont trust

We have had the a/c problem.  $700 and change.  We have the driver side wind noise.  $150 and change, now a sensor on the front wheel that causes a AWD off and no antilock brakes caution light to come on.  Thats $500 and change.  We also have a motor sound that runs in the beginning of a ride.  I would call it a ride leveler pump but the dealer can't hear this noise.  There are just a lot of problems it seems with this vehicle.  Thank GOD she hasn't had the no start problem yet.  But this one is no different than the others and I am sure its about to happen."

The left front bearing went and was repaired under warranty. It has been a very reliable car, and is superb in the snow. I currently have 66,000 miles on it and no problems. I recommend buying a used one with an extended warranty. The gas mileage is very good for a truck this size. I get about 19/20 mpg average. None of the truck chasis SUV's can come close to the comfort and handling of this SUV. It's not perfect, but it's a steal if bought used. Go ahead and compare it to the Pilot, even MDX, it's that good.          "
buick,rendezvous,2002,Beverly Wiles, 03/10/2016,With Remote Start,5,"We purchased this vehicle 2nd hand for $8500 with Remote Starter. All in all this has been a good car for us and on many occasions had the need to use the 7 available seats (which doesn't leave a lot of cargo room). When the two back seats are hidden there is plenty of cargo room and when all seats are tucked a lot of cargo room but only two people for the front seats can ride. Only gets approx. 14 miles per gal. for a 6 cylinder. My gas gage has been broken since we purchased this vehicle but I am able to use the set (gas used) to determine when to fill up. The AWD light has been intermittent and/or on most of the time since we have owned this and always no one can figure out why... drives better when on (ha ha), breaks will sometimes grind when coming to a stop when the light is off, but no one see's this when testing... uggh! Repairs mostly normal wear and tear as with any vehicle oil, brakes, filters, battery and now alternator (we think). Early on we did have to have the head gasket repaired that was over $2000. Can be a bit expensive on even the smallest of repairs. Hate having to go to dealer to fix as they are always the most expensive! The alternator repair could cost over $450 unless I can find someone else to repair at a lower cost...uggh thank god for having a second car for the moment!

buick,rendezvous,2002,jwebb5, 01/03/2012,dont make this mistake,2,"bought used. WORSE car EVER! first transmission went out, cost close to 2 grand to fix, then over heated due to a leak in the coolant system, blew an intake gasket costing another wad of money, then the AC went out, AWD and antilock break system went out, replaced thermostat three times, and now has a blown head gasket! been in the shop more than it has been driven. Still paying payment :("
buick,rendezvous,2002,Darren, 06/16/2008,So-So,2,"I bought this car because my wife liked the looks of it. I should have researched it more. In the span of 80,000 miles we have had to replace front wheel bearings 3 times. Very weak on engine power. Make sure you have plenty of room to pass. On the positive side, we bought it with 123,000 on it and just recently turned 200,000 with same engine and transmission.   Warning, don't get a model with the self-leveling shocks. Can only get through GM at a cost of $250 per shock not including labor. Real joke. Would not buy Rendezvous"
buick,rendezvous,2002,Barry, 12/16/2008,Rendezvous Junk,2,"When we bought it we were so excited, then the repair bills started, rear aluminium bracket, 800 dollars, then brakes, then rotors, then engine manifold and head gaskets. Spent over $4000 in repairs in one year. GM put out over 3 million 3.4 engines with defective gaskets knowingly and did not recall, very unethical company. They also knew about defective wheel bearings, this has hurt their  sales in Canada big time. They are not an ethical company anymore and most of us GM folks have switched brands. Had a 4x4 as well and drove GM for years. Have to switch brands. "
buick,rendezvous,2002,Joe, 06/16/2009,MOST UNRELIABLE CAR EVER,2,"In the past year I had the versatrak AWD rear differential kick the buck ($8000 repair) then 2 months ago the transmission blew ($3000) then the torque tube, a part of the drive shaft acted up ($1500).  Before all this all the head gasket leaked ($1500) and the wheel bearings have all been replaced ($300 each).  So basically this car has sucked out all our savings.  GM has way over priced all its parts especially the rear differential - $6000 for part alone.  I didnt think any car could be this bad but GM has proven otherwise.  I will never buy any GM product ever again. They deserve the mess they've gotten themselves into, because of all the overpriced lemons they've sold."

There have been many during our 40 years together.  I like how it handles, as well as its appearance. It also comes in handy when we need the space to haul something.  My wife calls it her shuttle because she drives myself and my oldest son to our VA doctors appointments. It is a lot better as for getting in and out of compared to a car. I guess you could say we are completely satisfied with our Rendezvous."

If you go on forums this is a common problem for GM vehicles. there was even a class act against them from the Dexcool antifreeze.  It eats away the intake mainifold gasket People looking to purchase these vehicles need to know about it.  Min $800 to fix and hope that when your car overheated you didn't warp the head.

I did extensive comparison shopping among all manufacturers and chose the Rendezvous despite the fact that the model had just been introduced and had no product quality history. Immediately took it on a trip of over 1,000 miles and knew that I had bought the right car. Most autos don't have nearly enough height or leg room for me when driving, and the seat adjustments are inadequate - this was ideal. Expect my next car will be a new model of the Rendezvous."

My biggest dissapointment with the vehicle is that the power is marginal. The 185 Horsepower engine is just adequate. It rolls along smoothly and leisurly. The vehicle will let you know when it has to work hard to pull up a hill. The heads up display should not be an option. The gauges tend to get hard to see during the day. I have not had any problems with fit and finish of the material. I would like to see better materials for a vehicle in this price class.

Addition of a supercharger to add low

Alternatively, use a modern DOHC or 
SOHC engine to provide the some type of 
performance as the Acura MDX.
With either engine, fuel consumption

Practical in every way. 3 rows comfortable seating for seven full sized adults. No one had that in 2001-02. All kinds of imitators in the 5 years since this stylish truck hit the market. Lexus. Benz. Nissan. BMW. You name it, they all followed after they saw the 100's of thousands of Buicks sold. Probably an underappreciated vehicle. "

Right now it has a major mechanical problem and it has less than 100,000 miles.  The Chevrolet dealership is baffled as to what the problem is.

Lots of cubbies and storage spaces.  Excellent gas mleage - 19/24.  Maybe a bit less than perfect mechanically. New A/C compressor, engine water leaks, transmission, fuel system, a few other more minor problems.  Also, a few body integrity problems with wind noise, door fit.  Very poor resale value.

It is not powerful, but does what it needs to do in most situations.  It has eliminated the tired feeling I used to have after a day of driving our other, larger SUV, and gives the impression of a car-like drive.

Had electrical problems and had to pay to have them fixed. Then stereo blew and couldn't use CD player at all! Low price as a used minivan but many problems!
buick,rendezvous,2002,Rendylover, 04/22/2002,King of the crossover,4,"Great looking, excellent handling, max 
for the money"
buick,rendezvous,2002,AC, 04/23/2002,A Very Classy and Stylish Buick SUV,4,"Very nice SUV for Buick's first try in 
this market segment.  Has nice looks 
and standsout from the crowd.  Very 
pleasing interior with many nice 
touches.  Fit and finish inside and out 
is good.  Rides extreemly nice and is 
extreemly nimble for an AWD vehicle.  
Has great gas milage for its market 
segment.  With a wife and two young 
daughters I needed the room and safty 
features this vehicle provides. Overall 
a classy alternative to a Minivan."
buick,rendezvous,2002,DJ, 09/13/2008,Keeps me broke,3,"This car is the fanciest I have ever owned. Plus the costliest. I like the ride and comfort, leather, heated seats and all the bells and whistles but when things go wrong, it's expensive. In the almost three years I've owned this car, I've put a crankshaft sensor, O2 sensor, 6 tires, brakes all around, 2 wheel bearings, and now I need the AC fixed - condensor, two rear ""knuckles"", and the motor for the AWD. A recall on the wheel bearings was a joke. The mileage perimeter was 65,000. miles and I purchased it with 64,000. so six months later, the recall was toast.  Now I hope it lasts til I can pay it down enough to get another car. I was offered $2500 trade and I still owe $9700 on it"
buick,rendezvous,2002,Jo-Ann , 04/27/2002,"Go, Rendezvous",5,"This is a fun car to drive, easy to 
handle, plenty of storage, and a great 
sound system"
buick,rendezvous,2002,dispatcher2020, 04/27/2002,Finally got it,4,"I've loved this suv since it came out. 
My biggest problem was choosing the 
color. Decided on the pewter and it is 
so pretty. It's great to haul stuff and 
I got the 3rd row seats so it's good to 
transport all my son's friends. Has a 
good ride and I love the full view. Had 
a Skylark before and was just impressed 
with Buicks. I love the look of this 
suv. I like it as well as the Lexus."
buick,rendezvous,2002,edavis, 04/27/2002,Rendezvous - the experts are crazy!,4,"Ive had this car for 10 days, but I 
looked at other SUV's and van's.  I 
will give an update after more use.

Experts are wrong in panning this 
vehicle for handling and power.  It ist 
underpowered in any significant way.  
I easily passed two cars going 65 
mph on a two lane road. Road 
testers realize almost few are 
interested in racing and slaloming 
down the highway.  Look at the 
features real people use.

I want to drive it everywhere, so I 
suppose our LeSabre is feeling sorry 
for itself.  

Interior room is good, not quite like 
our old van, but still very good.  

This is the compromise we were 
looking for.

Why pay more for a foreign SUV 
which is  inferior?  This should be a 
real hit."
buick,rendezvous,2002,2002 Rendezvous, 10/01/2008,Too costly to repair!,4,"I bought my Buick used with 17,000 miles on it. I have had all the bearings replaced. And the air conditioner condenser replaced twice in two years. The brakes do not last and other stuff I can't remember. The glove compartment hinge broke and they wanted the whole glove box replaced. The windshield fluid freezes up when it gets below zero even though I used special winter fluid. Now the service engine light is on and it won't pass the EPA check, so I have to trade it or buy a new sensor at $400 +. My next car will be a Toyota, Honda or some other reliable car that my friends rave about. I can no longer afford to ""buy American"" Are you listening, GM?"
buick,rendezvous,2002,Sandy Steinle, 04/29/2002,My new Rendezvous,4,"The dealership at Ancira was the best 
experiance I have had with a car 
dealership. I was looking for a new SUV 
to replace my 1998 Blazer, and had 
never noticed a Rendezvous before the 
day I took a test drive on 4-15-02. I 
was so impressed with the vehicle I 
almost bought on the spot. My husband 
convinced me to try out some other 
vehicles, so we shopped and drove 
several models before returning to 
Ancira to buy on 4-19-02. We have 
driven several short trips and plan a 
trip to Dallas later. We still love our 
new Rendezvous!"
buick,rendezvous,2002,mpeleaux, 05/03/2002,Never thought I'd drive a Buick!,5,"Suffice it to say that I research every 
car decision I make.  I was looking at 
little SUVs like the RAV4 and CRV, 
but wanted a 3rd seat.  We didn't 
want to go the mini-van route, and 
most SUVs seem too big and 
truck-like.  What to do?  I saw a 
CNN-online article mid-April that 
mentioned the Rendezvous and I 
decided to check it out.  I was  
completely won over by the perfect 
size, abundance of comfort features, 
nice styling, cargo/passenger 
flexibility and overall value.  It (in my 
opinion) manages to be refined, 
cool, fun and useful all at the same 
time.  I've always hated automatics, 
but got used to this in a hurry and 
think it has plenty of power."
buick,rendezvous,2002,juliaom, 10/29/2008,Mechanical Nightmare,3,"Do not buy this Buick RDV. Now at 114,000 miles but everything breaks, first the AC, other repairs, then window motors, head gaskets rebuilt, now AWD disable light on, dealer said new hub and sensors needed for $600. Has cost me close to $8000 since 2004. Now excessive rust on front of Hood, visibly accelerating. Service Mgr said I should write to Buick, as repairs have been excessive. Buick rep said too bad, its not under warrenty. Never again will I buy GM."

is top of its class."
buick,rendezvous,2002,Robbie, 05/10/2002,Disappointed,3,"This is a new vehicle which I test 
drove on smooth city streets.  When I 
drove it home via hill country, it 
turned into a struggling,noisy wimp.  
The all wheel drive feature makes the 
noise factor unacceptable.  I can't 
believe they make a trailer package 
for this s.u.v.  What could it 
possibly pull?"
buick,rendezvous,2002,Stergeye, 05/10/2002,Does it all,4,"I've got two small kids,a wife, and a 
dog.  So far, Rondezvous handles it all 
with ease.  On trips to the mountains, 
the AWD worked great.

Step-in height is good, and the 
Rondezvous' spaces are easy to access.  
Ride quality is very good.

No complaints thus far.  We are pleased 
beyond our expectations."
buick,rendezvous,2002,ppalonsky, 05/12/2002,1 Month Review,4,"After 1 month, this car is proving to 
be a very impressive vehicle. The RDV 
does most everything well, but I can't 
say it is the best in class on any 
given aspect.  The interior looks 
great, but the materials used have a 
somewhat cheap feel to them. The car 
does not have as much room as a 
minivan, but looks great. The 
versatrak AWD works well, but it can't 
go offroad like an SUV.  The ride is 
very carlike but not up to the level 
of a luxary car.  It manages to bring 
together most of the positive aspects 
of a luxary sedan, SUV and Minivan in 
one package.  I guess it may be the 
best in class afterall in the 
crossover vehicle catagory."
buick,rendezvous,2002,AWeaver, 01/30/2009,Great Ideas but toexpensive to maintain,4,"In 2002 while looking for a SUV for my wife, we looked at all of them. Most required her to pull herself into them, and the Rendezvous allow her easy ins & outs. I expect normal maintenance on all my vehicles; however in my 52 years of driving I have never had to replaced a A/C condenser or manifold gasket in my vehicles like we Rendezvous owners have. GM knows they made a mistake on both, and as much as she likes this Rendezvous I will never buy another Buick, and may not consider a GM vehicle after owing over 20 of them."

w/large models being used to a minivan. 
Found plenty of room but even luxury 
models had big truck feel/ride I hated. 
Mid SUVs were blah! Just when I was 
ready to give up SUV idea I found the 
Rendezvous. Reviews were mixed but I 
was curious enough to check out. Glad I 
did! I LOVE MY ""RUV""! Ride is 
awesome,smooth & quiet. Leather seats 
roomy, 2nd row Capt seats keep my 2 
kids happy in their own space. When 
needed 3rd row offers comfortable xtra 
seating. 3rd row down--great cargo 
room. Tons of extras. Excellent value 
for my $$ glad I passed up Acura MXD! 
Handles beautifully.Was used to better 
MPGs but I hear 17mpg not bad for this 
veh type. Test drive & see!"
buick,rendezvous,2002,NCC, 03/26/2009,Great Experience,4,"Bought the car new and have put 105K on it. 1 set of tires,1 set of brakes, 1 battery. That's it. It has never stranded me, never failed to start. Every accessory (it's Loaded) still works. Lowest cost of ownership I've ever had. I like it better than my wife's Lexus RX 330. 17-18 mpg city 26 hgwy.   "
buick,rendezvous,2002,mommamia, 03/29/2009,ORIGINAL MONEY PIT,2,"I bought this used in nov 2005 without researching it. BIG MISTAKE! Thankfully, I bought the extended warranty. I have had everything replaced that everyone who owns this car has, A/c condenser, etc. I took the car for a routine oil change (not at dealer) and he pointed out a ""lower intake valve"" problem, to which the dealer said ""no problem with it."" I definitely got my money's worth with the warranty, but now that it's expired I'm having problems with my ABS system, computer, and rear suspension knuckle. Parts and labor? $1800! I owe 2 1/2 more years on this pile...and the Kelley is ABSOLUTELY AWFUL! It's worth 1400-3600 trade in. Pitiful...do not buy this car."
buick,rendezvous,2002,skbenedict, 05/23/2002,Rendezvous Requires Repairs,3,"  First week of ownership, we 
had to take the car in for a 
malfunctioning climate control.   By 
mid to late April, the 
car spent 1 1/2 weeks in the shop for a 
faulty electrical system (Body Control 
Module).  The part had to be ordered 
twice as the first one had a glitch in 
it.  The parts for this car are few and 
far between and not easily attainable.  
I'm also disappointed in the mileage.  
Buick advertises 18/24 and we haven't 
seen it go above 18 on the highway. 
Isn't there a law against false 
advertisement?"

Was my dream car, first car I owned with heated leather,sunroof, power everthing..planned on keeping it until at least 110k..only got 84k out of it.  Had it 4 1/2 years and racked up over $9,000 in repairs, A/C broke, intake gaskets, coils, computer cellinoid, hubs etc.  same as everyone else.  Final breakdown was the transmission going at 84,000 miles. $4900 to repair... After being stranded twice and endless repairs finally traded it on a Japanese car. Will never buy a GM product again.

buick,rendezvous,2002,darren8c, 06/10/2009,All around good vehicle,4,"I love my Rendezvous.  We were looking for the interior of a minivan with the exterior of an SUV, so we love our Rendezvous.  It has captain chairs for the second row allowing you to easily access the third row.  The captains chairs are a must have if you have car seats.  I am 6'0 and can actually fit in every seat in the Rendezvous.  Also the AWD is really nice in the Wisconsin winter.  You do have to keep up on the maintenance and repair them more than Honda's and Toyota's.  If you want luxury, the interior design of a minivan, AWD, and the look of an SUV the Rendezvous CXL AWD is one of your only options, and it's a pretty decent one."

I have had this thing a lil over 2 years, and we have gone through ALL 4 wheel bearings!! We have problems with the anti-ock break system, and already had to replace Manifold!! VERY EXPENSIVE!!!! I am definately happy I have AAA, we have had this thing towed many times, and with 3 children that is NOT FUN!!! These people really better not wonder why they're goin outta buisness, cuz the repairs on this thing run my family 2 carpayments!!!! Its ridiculous! Please never ever buy this car!!!!!

by far."

Internet suggestions were wheel harness connection problems, but it took 3 Dealers to find that GM Part#88896067, a fluid valve in the rear had a faulty temperature sensor, sending out a message that the rear drive was overheating. Had valve replace and it now works fine. Very comfortable to get in and out for an old man."

Dealership replaced Heating/AC system faulty at purchase. Car had a few in between issues covered by warranty.  OK, warranty over.  Car had starting problems. I'm not recession skipped, but mechanics want to get paid to diagnost problems.  They say no codes appear.  Towed to dealership and they ""think"" it's fuel pump.  Want MAJOR money, right?  Drove vehicle out to ser station, ""Go Figure""!  They say not fuel pump, fuel filter rather.  Started.  Walmart changed air filter.  Started and went home.  Home, dead again.

problems.  One trip of 1000 miles taken, ride slightly more uncomfortable 
than Park Ave.  Air cond a bit weak in 90 degree temp.  Overall it performs 
well and handles well on highway and city.   Be cautious of considerable 
blind spot on right side, this may not be uncommon in the SUV's but it takes 
somme adjustment.   Seats are a bit weak for this type of vehicle."
buick,rendezvous,2002,printman, 06/25/2002,What to call it?,4,"This vehicle rides like butter, smooth 
and soft, with enough power to get into 
traffic with ease.  Visibility all 
around is good, and is reinforced with 
the ultrasonic backup system  a must 
have.  The stereo is a delight that 
floods the cabin with great sound - 
which is good because theres hardly 
any road noise to keep you awake.  
Finally, the headroom even with the

for 1 week.  It has now been 2, 
months, (3000 mi), and we have 
never been happier with a new car.  
Fit and finish  is pefect, as we looked 
in vain for some defect in 
manufacture, but have found none.  
The engine is powerful enough for 
passing on two lane roads and 
getting up to speed 
to enter a city trafficway.  Who needs 
more?  The comfort 
is outstanding, comparable to a nice 
sedan.
If you want the room of a van and the

RDV."

What a great surprise when we finally 
drove it. We did not want 3 seats, so 
were delighted to have the choice and 
all the goodies that are standard blew 
us away. I couldn't believe there was 
an affordable SUV that rides like a 
luxury sedan, get great mileage and 
looks as good as anything on the road."

car (SUV) that was not too big or to 
small.  When we saw the RDV in the show 
room we like the roomy interior and the 
3rd row seat. The exterior could use 
more ""looks"" to it  

After three one month of driving the 
car the driver's seat began to make 
noises at every turn.  After three 
months the rear view mirror fell off.  
Sure, the dealer fixed the seat and the 
mirror but who likes to take their new 
car 

Overall we enjoy the car but I wonder 
whether we should have asked for a 
longer bumper to bumper Warantee 
because it seems that we may need it!"

Head gasket replaced at 55k and 175k, air conditioning condenser, power steering pump, 3 wheel bearings, 4th gear on transmission failed, rear ball joints replaced. All of these identified by service bulletins but cost me just more than $10,000 in repairs with no relief from GM except the first head gasket. Last jab is being left no residual value on resale. GM makes the mistakes and the customer pays. What a disappointment. GM should learn that reputation not just made on successes but how you handle the failures. In this case GM made the customer pay. Losing market share GM? Wonder why? You shouldn't!"

very important to this over 50 year old 
couple. Add the memory feature of 
driver's seat and mirrors, plus plenty 
of comfort and great Turnpike ride, and 
I place the Highlander second. The ONLY 
shortcoming is the lack of power. But, 
I am enjoying better and better highway 
fuel mileage as a trade off. The RDV 
delivers near 26 mpg at highway speeds. 
I don't mind a lack of brute power in

In the  end, I was down to a three year

vehicle.  The car handles reasonably 
well for it's size and is very 
comfortable inside.  The controls are 
logically arranged and easy to use. 
With the 2nd row captains chairs, we 
find the interior to be very 
accommodating - and it's fairly easy 
for even a large adult to get into the 
rear seats.  My only real 
disappointment is with the fuel 
economy, which even on long, flat 
highway trips has been WELL below

highly recommend the Rendezvous. Gas 
mileage avgs around 22 in city, and 
have acheived 24 highway. The third

in very handy for us. I can seat 6

While it may not be the best looking vehicle on the road, all the kids in the neighborhood think the car is pretty cool!"
buick,rendezvous,2002,Annette, 02/28/2002,love my SUV,4,"It is a great SUV, that met all of my needs.  It drives like a luxury sedan, is AWD, has seating for 7 (like my previous van) and is at a good price point."
buick,rendezvous,2002,lukjack, 03/01/2002,rdv- very nice vehicle,4,"A luxirous, fun to drive, alternative to a minivan or large SUV.  Third row back seat gives plenty of seating, along with an adequate amount of storage. Power is 185hp, but gives plenty accelaration and quiet cruising, but also allows 24 mpg highway and around 18-19 in city.  Also, it has AWD Versatrak and front/side airbags.  For all the luxury, $2002 rebate, and selling for around invoice, a great value that puts it $10,000 less than Acura MDX or Lexus RX300 purchase price."
buick,rendezvous,2002,Redcoat, 01/03/2003,Nice vehicle,4,"Nice to drive.  Had problem with 
electric system, but dealer gave me 
free loaner for one week while being 
serviced.  Somehow the wires got wet 
causing the entire system to short 
out.  Once fixed, no further problems. 
Drives and handles well, best mpg is 
about 18..thought I'd get better than 
that.  Easy to manuever in parking 
lots."

tight turning radius. Very 
comfortable. We get tons of

catching on in our city.  The 8

Have heard numerous comments about 
being underpowered.  I used to think 
that as well.  Now I believe if it is, 
it's very slight.  Great vehicle. High

I do have to say I am happy with the mpgs I an getting. At 80 I'm seeing 24.7 av mpgs on the FL. TPK. So I'm glad I did not get a V8 powered SUV.  Around town as a kid transport you could do a lot worse, I talked to a lot other mid sized SUV owners and while they like there MB MLs, BMW X5s and the lot, the x-tra bucks they spent may have been, as some have said un-wise."

Buick Rendevous after test driving it twice. I found the exceleration just fine. The interior appointments are luxurious and the eight speaker CD player has great sound. This vehicle is larger and more compfortable than other SUV's."

minivan and SUV features included, so 
we bought a brand new one on Jan. Had 
trouble finding a good dealer, and 
sales was good. Then we found out how 
easy it can roll away into an accident. 
At first nobody knew of the easy towing 
feature that caused accident, so some 
help was volunteered. But when we try 
to get help from GM for cause of 
accident, everybody from the dealer up 
to GM headquaters became mean and 
blamed us for misinformation.  We are 
waiting for the recall!!.  Now only 30K

luxury car and an suv and for the AWD.  
Mechanically, I am disappointed.  I 
drive mostly highway miles 6 days a 
week (52 miles round trip).  My tail 
lights developed problems and it took 
the dealer 4 trys to fix that.  Next 
problem was my airconditioning needed a 
new condenser.  Now at 40K miles my 
transmission went out.  They went ahead 
an got GM to warranty it with a 
rebuilt.  The rebuilt lasted 50 miles

13 days.  The gas mileage could be 
better. 18MPG.  The engine is

We have only had one waranty repair 
since purchased.(Traction Control

Avelanche to this, thinking I wouldn't 
like it at all. I'm glad I traded! I 
can't wait to drive it daily. It is a 
very smooth ride, the sound is great. 
This Rendezvou has many ""fun"" options 
that I never had before on any other 
vehicle before. I plan on buying 
another when time to trade.The only 
thing I really don't like about it are 
these things:

1) It doesn't feel secure when it's 
raining and you hit a large spot of 
water.
2) I very much liked having 2 visors 
per front seat. One for the front view

Florida and back twice since I bought it

distance running vehicle.  I disagree 
with the road test editors opinions' 
regarding the power of this vehicle.  It 
had plenty power accelerating from 65 
mph to 80 mph when I needed to pass 
other cars on the highway. Also, the gas 
mileage was extraordinary at 30 mpg. for 
the duration of both trips to Florida.  
I found the handling to be rather tight 
as compared to the Ford explorer and the 
Isuzu Rodeo which I have owned 
previously. I would strongly recommend 
this vehicle to anyone who is looking 
for a roomy, comfortable SUV like 
vehicle.     "

300-500 miles per week on highways. 
Ignition switch was defective from the
first day. Engine lacks torque/power.
Intermittent rattles in dashboard and
steering column. Some features of Driver
Information System are unreliable. Seems
to have defective electronics. Good SUV
idea that was cheaply implemented but
carries a hefty MSRP of $34,000.
Hopefully parts will be less expensive

miles on it this last summer.  We stole
it off the lot, with the price we ended
up paying for it.

I had to pay 1/2 on the wheel bearings to the dealership because they claimed it wasn't covered on the warranty I purchased, saying it was ""normal wear and tear"".  But, I'd only had the vehicle two weeks and couldn't have done that damage.  They decided to charge me 1/2 to fix it.  I thought it odd that a vehicle only 2 years old had such problems.  I have not had any other problems and really the vehicle."

The day after we drove it home, the air conditoning went out , and took 3 days to fix. Then on Memorial Day weekend , it went dead on me in another town, and we had to find a ride home. That was another couple of weeks without the ca,r and the dealership couldn't find out what was wrong with it. 2 weeks later, it left me on the side of the road again with a 2 month old. By the time of my 3rd payment, I hadn't actually had the car 3 weeks. No one could find out what was wrong, and the dealership wouldn't take it back. Still having problems. A bad experience. "

At about 40,000 miles (just after the warranty ran out), we started to have problems that I don't think should ever occur on such a new vehicle.  The air conditioning compressor cracked, and we were told that it was an engineering flaw (replaced to the tune of over $900).  Just this week, we had to replace the head gaskets (I've NEVER had to replace head gaskets before) and the fan motor --- this bill was $1331.  Because of the problems we have had with this vehicle, we will never buy another GM (we've been loyal GM customers for the last 17 years).  "

handles on ice exceptionally with the

At 59,000 miles, the upper and lower intake gaskets.  64,000 miles the body control module failed.  This causes your lights to begin randomly flashing, while your horn begins honking all by themselves.

The vehicle has a lot of ""bells and whistles. I love the ""heads-up"" display which gives me my MPH reading in the windshield. Because of the air suspension, the car allows me to inflate my tires directly from the system so no visit to a gas station is necessary.  It's also handy if you get a flat tire.

So, it appears that GM is not entirely up front, so to speak, when they tell you, that the coolant is good for 100,000 miles. Now it appears that the gas mileage is falling off, a little.

miles around the US last summer,

there wasn't one that I wanted or

the versatility of a van and AWD of an 
SUV."

fooled.  At 45000 out of warranty (Glad

Needed intake manifold gasket replaced as well as new head gaskets.  $1,680. Then 2 days later found a crack in the A/C condenser. Condenser needed to be replaced. GM finally paid the cost of the condenser ($400+/-) and we paid the labor ($423).  Even though other Rendezvous' were having manifold gasket and head gasket problems they refused to help us with the repair costs.  51,000 miles is to early to have these types of problems.  I do like the interior design and feel when driving this vehicle.  Due to the mechanical defects, I would not recommend anyone purchase this vehicle. "

for a family looking for a stylish, 
quality vehicle with a great ride and 
storage. The exterior resembles an SUV, 
but the interior offers all the 
functionality of a luxury sedan. I love 
all the compartments - to store my 
belongings and my passengers. I have 
the optional 3rd row seat, which is 
great for hauling around my kids 
friends from soccer! The Rendezvous is 
functional for every day use, but also 
great for longer trips - it's very 
comfortable. A family vehicle you're 
not afraid to show up in - whether it's 
your high school reunion or the new hot 
restaurant in town. Highly recommend it!"

over 70% of the time. Very comfortable 
ride and the gas milage is ok at 18mpg.
However, any repair has been expensive. 
I purchased an extended warrenty that 
expired 1K mi ago. And then the 
igintion switch went out.. a part that 
is combined with the steering wheel and 
steering column.. To the tune of $1,600 
to repair. Parts take up to two or 
three weeks which adds to the costs 
since I had to rent a car to continue 
working. Also, tires do not last past 
40k and I've experienced several 
repairs covered under warrenty. Can't 
wait to unload this over priced SUV"

for the last 3 years; no real major 
problems.  Only the A/C compressor went 
out at about 30K (under warranty).  My 
only real complaint is the materials 
used in the vehicle just ""feel"" cheap; 
not up to other luxury SUV standards.  
However, this vechicle is loaded with 
options and has great passenger/storage 
room.  I have noticed a lot of rattles 
and squeeks (sun roof, seats, doors, 
etc).  Just one final note:  
Depreciation is HORRIFIC; so if you get 
one, you need to keep it a LONG time.

Consistent electrical problems where all the lights inside and out go out for 15 sec.  Windshield cracked when turning on heat on cold day, 36K.  Windshield needed to be replaced $500. Dealership said there was no trauma but would not replace.  Windshield wipers collapsed while driving in pouring rain on 95.  Ignition switch ""shot"".  Computer board panel needs to be replaced...should I go on?  AC does not work.  Mileage is poor, handling is poor.  Major blind spots.  GM is not helpful at all at addressing these issues.  Paid 28000, 6K miles.  Still owe 17K, worth MAYBE 10K!!!! "

We rolled the huge box, and slid it in, ALL the way, and closed the hatch! Try that with ANY SUV this nice, priced under $28K brand new. It won't happen. - The sight lines, the great engine performance, and 22.5 MPG for the first 50K that we've driven it, are unmatched with anuthing else we've looked at. - We were the first ones in our town to own one, now there are HUNDREDS! The fact that SO MANY other SUV's came out with room for 7, AFTER they saw how these sold, tells you a lot. "

Luckily no one was injured while the dealer tried to figure out what the rumbling noise was each time.  The heater/AC blower had to be replaced.  Now I need all the gaskets replaced before the engine seizes.  I will never buy a first year production auto again.  The dealer says I should have bought the extended warranty, but the warranty on the Rendezvous is just not long enough.  "

I have had the car into the dealership on the average once per month for problems.  A/C went at 30,000K and I never use it.  Wind noise on driver's side is annoying on long drives, brakes are less than desireable, electrical problems and fuses blowing for no reason are annoying.  The vehicle has never left me stranded however the other problems have been annoying and inconvenient.  The cheap interior is starting to detriorate.  Tires cause wobble on turns and needed to be replaced. Heater motor blew up at 10K.  All was under warranty but that does not excuse the inconvenience.  Truck has 69K on it and thankfully I have extended coverage.  "
buick,rendezvous,2002,Family man, 05/24/2005,Worried about Relliability,2,"We bought our Rendezvous instead of a minivan because of the looks and minivan functionability.  In many respects this is an acceptable vehicle.  It it definitely underpowered and this shows up in fuel economy in hilly terrain. In a car that is less than three years old, we have had electrical problems that have left us stranded.  Since my wife carts our two children in it most of the time, this lapse in reliability is a serious issue for us.  The first time the dealer said is was a dead battery.  Then, 2,000 miles out of warranty it was the computer ($500 out of pocket).  Now, they think it is the ignition switch (around $200).  It seems like a systemic problem that GM is not acknowledging.

Fortunately, I bought extended warranty. This problem is well known with GM but they have done nothing about it. I will never buy another GM vehicle again.

I live in PA, very tough on vehicles. Salt on the roads all winter. Large pot holes. One day last winter I counted twelve small cars and small SUV's on the side of the road with serious suspension problems after one of our major highways fell apart in Jan. My Rendezvous has a tough suspension, stainless exhaust and large 16"" wheels.   The activated charcoal cab air filter is great for keeping deisel exhaust etc. out of your lungs.   The OnStar is a lifesaver I will not do without.   The galvanized metal body does not rust.   No problem with half ton loads"

Comfort is good, and long trips are not tiring. But, the car has been a succession of one repair after another - most a function of mediocre engineering. Most annoying is what the dealership tells me is an inherent flaw in the intake gasket which requires too frequent replacing. Will I continue to drive this vehicle? Yes. Would I buy it again? No."

Once I reached about 50K, it's been problem after problem. The A/C condenser went, engine antifreeze gasket leaks, and we had to replace the transmission and the car's computer. In addition, there were other costly repairs, like excessive tire wearing (never in an accident). We've had to get two wheel alignments and four new tires twice in the past 18 months. Also had the AWD light come on, and of course that was broken. Another major hassle is a blockage in the igintion.

We had the standard air conditioner cracks (warranty) and the driver's lumbar knob has broken off three times, but it wasn't until after the warranty ran out that we got to experience the head and intake gaskets (as everyone else seems to have also experienced). The extended warranty (thank God I bought it) sent an inspector to the dealership to ensure there was no fraud with all the problems I was charging to them.

Within a few thousand miles after warranty expiration, right and left wheel bearings and air condintioning needed repair. Approximately every 3 months since then (over the past 4 years), a major malfunction has occurred, which usually consists of the car not starting for a variety of reasons, including major fuel line corrosion. I don't understand how this vehicle has been reviewed so highly. Most people I've talked to with Rendezvous have had similar experiences.

I am a 58 yr old woman and the SUV was serviced regularly at the Buick garage, My Buick dealer has been great thru all of this.Supplying me with a loaner etc. Buick however, did nothing!

I am just sad they no longer make this car as I am now at the point of needing a newer vehicle.
I maintained it well, and the car responded accordingly.
The only maintenance outside of the usual wear and tear (brakes!) was a transmission replacement that was done under the warranty so did not cost me a penny.

I went from a little 2001 Pontiac Grand Am to this..

I know some people say it looks like an older person's vehicle, but after driving similar SUVs ,like a Ford Escape, the Buick Rendezvous was my favorite! 

*There are little to no blindspots which is awesome!

*The interior feels pretty modern.

buick,rendezvous,2003,argon1, 07/06/2014,don't waste your money,2,"after buying this auto it failed in many ways first it was the brake lines that rotted out, then the over heating problem and the engine repair then the rotors and pads, the wheel bearing next. all of this with in 1.5 yrs of owning it and less than 5000 miles this is nothing as to having to tear the front end apart just to change the battery . so far I put another 3000 dolars into it since I got it. and to top that off the window fell down and I found that all the plastic parts that hold the window had broken lol this is the auto for you if the bank is yours."
buick,rendezvous,2003,Jimmy McGee, 01/08/2017,SPORTY SMOOTH RIDE,4,"Just be cautious before purchasing one. Drive a few different ones of the same year and model. Low miles doesn't mean good miles. If low miles are what you're looking for, try and research whether they were hard and fast or normally acquired. Everyone drives a vehicle differently. Get a feel for the car. A car can communicate with you if you know what to listen, look, and watch for in a used vehicle. I strongly suggest getting a car-fax report. It is worth the $23.00 it cost. Though it's not a promise that everything is cool with your car, but it can be a good indicator as to service intervals.

I can't remember. This car PLAIN AND SIMPLE SUX! It needs MAJOR REPAIRS EVERY Flippin month. I have spent more repairing this dumb thing than my old '92 Geo Prizm!!
Do NOT buy this vehicle, its NOT as nice as it looks! Better off with Hyundai, or Kia! We purchased in '06 used from an elderly couple who rarely used it... It had 12,000 miles!!! They took care of it, had receipts of oil changes, and car fax was FLAWLESS!!!"
buick,rendezvous,2003,Cindy lou, 11/30/2016,Buy me if you're rich...,2,"I love the comfort of the ride, and being able to use it for camping...  but, I am constantly putting money into it, most guaranteed this happens every year.....  brakes, rotars, bearings, lines, etc, I could continue but I don't remember all of them...  my car is in the shop again today, for the 3rd time this year!!  It's a very costly vehicle to own cause it's continually needing repairs!!  I'm frustrated today knowing I have to spend my Christmas money to repair my car AGAIN...  I already spent $1,000.00 so far this year, and here comes another expense.

buick,rendezvous,2003,craerz, 12/20/2009,Decent Car for family,3,"I bought this car brand new and have kept up with maintenance.  The RDV is pretty reliable under those conditions.  What's gone wrong so far is; battery leak, head gasket leak, and recently (after 6 years) the battery and O2 sensor needed replacing.  The first two were fixed under warantee so NBD.  There was also a recall on the rear lift gate.  Oh, and now my gas cartridges are shot on the lift gate.  The gas milage started out at 22mpg city and 26 on the road, but now we're about 18 city and 22 on the road.  Not too bad for a 7-seater.  In 2005 we drove this on vacation from Houston, to Sante Fe, to Denver and back to Houston.  No problem.  We strapped a DVD player to the wide console.  "
buick,rendezvous,2003,Julie, 06/19/2010,brake fluid fire,3,"YESTERDAY; our daughter was driving back home from an appt when the brakes failed--she eased it home, was in the house telling us about the problem for about 15-20 minutes while car was sitting turned off in the driveway. My husband went out to look under the hood and found it ON FIRE.  Brake fluid was dripping on the hot manifold Luckily he was able to extinguish it.  I believe the design of the engine with the brake line so close situated just above the hot manifold is ultimate cause. The heat MUST be causing the lines to crack/leak unlike in any other vehicle I have owned.  We have seen reports online of similar problems since this happened to us.  "
buick,rendezvous,2003,David, 06/29/2005,This vehicle is great!,5,"Definitely a great SUV.  Comfortable to ride in, roomy and gets good gas mileage.  I get about 400 miles to a tank.  Not too shabby!  Wheel bearing on left did go out after warranty but luckily I purchased the extended warranty.  Also hit a deer with it. It's fixed now, but the damage was minimal due to the sturdy build and great crash test ratings. I love it, love it love it!"
buick,rendezvous,2003,Brenda Wendelken, 03/09/2006,My Rendezvous,4,"Purchased this 1 year old car with 13000 miles on it from a dealer.  All who ride in my car say it is the most comfortable riding SUV ever. Just like sitting on the living room sofa.   It drives and handles like a Cadillac, has great pickup when needed; dashboard accessories are also conveniently located on steering wheel making for safer driving (no looking down to change radio stations, etc).   Cargo area large enough for most items, middle seats fold down easily to create more room in cargo.  Also has Onstar if installed when purchased.   My only criticism is color of the spedometer numbers hard to see in daylight.   Thank you GM for this great car!!"
buick,rendezvous,2003,Robert, 05/23/2005,Extended Warranty Required,4,"A great SUV....but it does have its quirks. At 37,123 (after the warranty) the left wheel bearing (lots of this according to GM and Buick) went out and the headers leak coolant. In for repairs, a major expense but I had Extended Coverage and saved BIG money. I am told that A/C goes out frequently also. Cannot customize factory presets. Annoying. Can't adjust door locks or running lamps or other warnings or features. Buick decided for you. "
buick,rendezvous,2003,V8 Man, 07/07/2010,Mixed feelings,3,"I bought a 2003 CXL Rendezvous with 40K miles in 2005.  I got it for $16,500--I would not even have looked at it for the new sticker price ($30,000+).  Overall, I have mixed feelings about this car, leaning toward favorable.  On the positive side, it is a good-looking car, has a nice interior, and rides quiet.  The 3.4 L V6 engine is strong enough for most trips.  We got the third-row seat, but hardly needed it with just two kids (it folds nicely into the floor). On the negative side, I have replaced a number of parts--head gasket, driver-side hub assembly, electric window motor, electric lock, and rear differential fluid.  Heater blows cold air on passenger side.  Gas mileage is awful (15). "
buick,rendezvous,2003,Ralph R., 01/11/2018,Rendezvous does everything it was designed to do w,5,"Affordable, economical, comfortable, reliable and very spacious.

Update, the car (2003 CX) is now the primary vehicle for my 17 year old daughter. It continues to perform reliably and is a very safe car. It is great in poor weather and gives her a commanding view and driving position. The car now has 175,000 miles on it and still works and looks great. Far cheaper to maintain than a newer vehicle or replacing it with something newer. Parts are inexpensive and readily available.

buick,rendezvous,2003,Lani, 07/06/2009,Don't buy an '03 Rendezvous!,2,"Have had this car for a year, replaced engine, battery, power steering hose, engine belt, brakes, tires need air every month, needs new rear shocks and oxygen sensor.  AWD DISABLE light is on, who knows how much that will cost.  Exhaust Manifold in these cars leaks coolant into engines causing engine problems, so will probably have to have manifold replaced. "
buick,rendezvous,2003,Theresa, 08/18/2009,Think foreign,3,"I loved my Rendevous but at 97,000 miles I have put 3,000 in repairs, and am possibly looking at another 3,000.  I am told the rear differential is bad in this suv and that it is a common problem.  I am now looking at spending more on repairs than the vehicle is worth.  Very disappointed that GM won't take more responsibility for their design flaws. Might make me consider another American car but not at this point.....EVER!"
buick,rendezvous,2003,lkg112, 09/13/2009,Getting rid of soon...not soon enough,3,"When we bought ours in 2005, it had 41,000 miles on it. We now have just under 88,000 and its going to go when we get it out of the shop, AGAIN. We average around every 3-4 months in the shop for around a week at a time. Lots of issues, including new bearings, VersaTrak suspension went out, wiper motor didn't work after a month into the purchase. Several big ticket items.  We purchased an extended warranty--4 years/100,000 miles through GM. We have gotten our money's worth out of the warranty. Unfortunately, 4 years expired in July and now we have to have the rear differential replaced to the tune of $1500 out of our pocket. Ouch.  Bye bye Buick. Not buying another GM product. P.O.S."
buick,rendezvous,2003,MP, 09/21/2009,Big Mistake,1,"Purchased this vehicle with 35,000 miles on it.  It was ok for the first year and then one thing after another started to go on this car.  It seems to be in the shop every other month and each time costs range from $300 up to over $1000!!!!  I am getting rid of this car and most likely won't buy another Buick any time soon!"
buick,rendezvous,2003,MomofthreePA, 12/16/2009,Very sorry we bought this vehicle,2,"We purchased our Rendezvous with just 16,000 miles due to our growing family.  At 24,000 miles replaced intake manifold (it was out of warranty because 3 years had passed since it went into service).  This cost $1,200.  12,000 miles later it had to be replaced again, the dealer charged a ""discounted rate"" of $800.00.  Then a window would not come up, and the cost came to over $400.00.  At 51,000 miles the first of two wheel bearings went, now the AWD Disable light is on and we are waiting for an estimate for repair of it and yet another wheel bearing.  What a nightmare.  The car has 52,000 miles and has cost us thousands in repairs, wrote to GM with no response.  "

I took the Pacifica originally because it looks and feels sportier than the Redndezvous.  Unfortunately after communing in the Pacifica for a few weeks I found the ride to be quite uncomfortable for someone my height (6'4"").  I eventually traded it to my wife for her Rendezvous.  I like the sporty look and feel of the Pacifica, but I appreciate the unbelievably comfortable seats (wide, high, heated) and soft ride of the Buick.  "
buick,rendezvous,2003,Jon Tao, 08/01/2006,My Opinion of Buick has Slipped,3,"We bought this car new, not knowing it was made in Mexico.  Shame on me for not doing my research.  At 60k, the intake manifold started leaking and at 84k, the transmission needed major work.  I am disappointed.  GM needs to do better.  It seems that these two problems are very common for this engine and transmission.  "

The first GM vehicle I owned was a Chevrolet Vega back in the 1970s - enough said - and incredibly, the Rendezvous is even worse! Engine, transmission, AWD drive train, climate control, you name it. I thought in the three decades plus since the Vega, they would have learned how to build cars; no such luck. "
buick,rendezvous,2003,Frosty, 06/12/2006,Utter Junk,2,"Bought this because my wife did not want to by typical looking minivan for the kids. What a bad choice. So far we have had the air conditioning overhauled at 10K miles, the engine seals blow at 20K miles, a complete transmission overhaul at 30K miles (had to call the mfg to get this covered under warranty), and now at 45K the wheel bearings and gas guage (800$ just for the gas guage repair)are toast. This is my second GM experience, fool me twice shame on me. As soon as I pay for the new bearings I am running to a Japanese or Korean car dealer ASAP."

buick,rendezvous,2003,Chad, 05/06/2006,A GM Fan No More!,3,"I bought this vehicle beacause of the rear cargo space and I did like how it drove compared to the Chrysler Pacifica. However as far as reliability, this vehicle is not what I would have expected for a Buick. I put on alot of miles and am beginning to be nickeled and dimed on this SUV.  I can't say that I will be buying another GM soon. I'm looking to trade this one away. But oh yeah, that's right, it doesn't hold it's value neither. Guess I'm out of luck."
buick,rendezvous,2003,very happy, 06/28/2006,Very happy,4,I have used this car extensivly and I love it.  Plenty of cargo space and comfort.  More room than the most SUVs in its class.  Rides like a car but has the room of a truck.

The First year we have had the front end aligned 5 times & purchase new tires, A/C motor replaced, reinstalled front fender assembly 2 times (plastic push pins), heater core replaced, back hatch recall.  The dang thing will not move on snow or wet ground.  It has spun me around backwards while going down the road 2 times.  No power, bad mpg. Bad road & wind noise. I get a horrible back ache if I drive it over 2 hours.  My Oldsmobile would hold more in the trunk than this thing will in the back seat and cargo.  Cannot see out of it. I never park where I have to back up.  Big mirrors that are useless except for blind spot. Dangerous vehicle"

I have loaded 50 bags of mulch in it, moved furniture, TVs, and an assortment of other things that I could not fit into our minivan. The key thing to any car's reliabilty is maintenance. Oil changes regularly, transmission flushed once a year and don't drive it like a sportscar because it ain't one. Simple rules to follow to keep your car performing at 80K plus and still going strong."

Only had one small problem, so far, still under warranty. Every one remarks about the ride, and handling. Due to my job, I drive around 20 different cars a day, and if I drive a Rendezvous there is a different feeling about them. I occasionally pull a cargo trailer,and it does a great job, but just slightly under powered. I have the third seat but don't use it. Has plenty of cargo room for me. I purchase it because of the positive reviews that I read. "

Unfortunately, the longer we have had it, the more cheaply made it seems. Not a lot of problems mechanically with this car through the 3 years I have owned it,  but little stuff: windows always squeal, leather strap to close hatch broke within a couple months of owning, rear wiper has never worked correctly. Tires lose pressure. Now I feel the tranny is slipping, and warranty expires in 3 days. Was told at the dealership they can't find anything wrong, and I can't trade this in, because I can't afford the negative equity"

If you plan on putting more than 75000mi on this car, do not buy a Rendezvous! Great car up to 75k after that: ABS-Traction Control( caused accident as it went out during hard braking), driver window, door locks, power mirrors, switches and engine blew at 103k. Replaced engine and now it is totally impossible to fill coolant at home. Also, it gets horrible gas mileage, worse than my 94 Mustang Cobra! Do not buy a Rendezvous!"
buick,rendezvous,2003,Waldo, 02/22/2009,The Reason GM is Bankrupt,3,"I just dumped mine. In 4 years: wheel bearing twice (the electronic controls for AWD are in the bearing assembly - a lousy design), heated seat burnt out, spare tire safety mechanism rusted shut (could not get spare out one night), and the best of all - valve lifter bolt sheared out of aluminum head. In the same time frame all I did was change the oil in a Honda Accord. A guy in my office also has 2003 and has had even worse problems including head gasket."
buick,rendezvous,2003,charlie_m, 03/09/2009,Won't do that again,3,"Bought in '04 with 25K miles - needed something that would fit a 6'3 teenage boy.  It was great the first year or so, then started nickel-and-diming me.  At 125K miles, and nickels and dimes are now up to $1000 repair bills. Poor mileage - gets about 20 mpg average. Cheap interior - coating chips off of radio and climate control knobs No interior release for the rear hatch.  Now the exterior release doesn't work. Back seat fold-down handle slips.  Can't find replacements anywhere. Replaced both front wheel bearings last year, just replaced rear wheel bearing and cylinder head gasket.

I complained about groaning hydraulics from day one, but CMP Classic said it was normal. Then the AWD quit, just out of warranty. Both GM and the dealer washed their hands of it. Everything has gone wrong with this piece of rubbish, including the driver's lumbar support exploding while I was on the highway. Acceleration (if you can call it that) comes in intermittent bursts; the transmission doesn't change down until you floor it, then it kicks down into first - all show, no go. "

We got rid of it and bought another Rendezvous.  We went back to the Rendezvous because it's comfortable, gets decent gas mileage, and has room to haul stuff.  The only things we are dissapointed about so far on the CX model is that it is missing a lot of the features that the CXL had. No backup sensors, cloth instead of leather, no third row seat (but it has the option to easily install an aftermarket one), and FWD instead of AWD.  We love having a Rendezvous--even without the CXL options--and are glad we bought another one!"

The heads-up display and backup sensors are great Buick features. Luckily, I also purchased the GM Major Guard protection plan. The dealer warranty was 60 days bumper to bumper. Within the first 60 days I had 3 wheel hubs (which includes sensors and bearings) replaced by the Buick dealership and a rear differential switch and fluid replaced. You have to be realistic when purchasing a used car (any car) that parts may need replacement and that the previous owner may have neglected problems due to trade-in etc. The 3.4 car can last at least 300,000 miles if maintained."

long and hard and when it came down to  
what suits our needs Buick won hands 
down. This vehicle rides better than 
any other vehicle we have owned. The 
room alone is a welcome feature and it 
has as much room as its larger

way. Plenty of power and features and 
at a fraction of the cost of others. 
Please test drive and then you will 
understand. We are very pleased."
buick,rendezvous,2003,Had2Move, 11/06/2002,Best crossover SUV,4,"Overall it is a great car. Traded in my 
2000 Pontiac Montana for it. Got tired 
of driving the big, typical mini-van. 
Handling of the Rendezvous is great and 
enjoy driving it. Just big enough to 
move around the family comfortably 
without feeling your driving a house! 
It also looks prestigious inside and 
out. Gauges are a little hard to read. 
Little constrast of grey on silver."
buick,rendezvous,2003,jnwfla, 11/09/2002,I love this car,5,"I bought this SUV about three weeks ago 
and love it.  This is my third SUV 
after a Ford Explorer and Honda CR-V.  
I love the ride."
buick,rendezvous,2003,johnny, 10/29/2002,Love It,4,"Had a Jimmy then Blazer.  I am a 
salesman on the road quite a bit.  Fuem 
Milage is good at around 23 mpg.  Ride 
is great compared to Blazer and the 
road noise is very low.  Plenty of 
storage space."
buick,rendezvous,2003,berne1, 10/03/2002,Built for how people REALLY use an SUV,4,"I reluctantly leased my Rendezvous CXL, 
never having owned an SUV/minivan type 
vehicle.  I am impressed so far at the 
build quality and amount of features 
for the money vs. a ""traditional"" truck-
based SUV.  Much more room, lower step 
in height and the Rendezvous is much 
quieter.  I have been surprised at how 
much I like it so far."
buick,rendezvous,2003,SunnyFlorida, 10/08/2002,Delivers what's promised,5,"We are very happy with our RDV.  Yes, it could use more power - however, a 
bigger engine would put the RDV right with the other gas guzzlers.  Get 22.5 
average - 26.5 on the highway.  Use the cruise control - and use slow starts 
- when possible. City traffic will greatly decrease milage.  Can remove all 
seats to haul large items easily when seats removed.  If you are like me and 
don't haul stuff often, removing seats is minor consideration.  Skip AWD 
unless you live in severe snowy conditions - gas milage will suffer.  A very 
environmentally friendly, spacious and comfortable vehicle.  Vehicles such 
as this will reduce our dependence on foreign oil."

drive.  Very responsive.  Good overall 
view of the road."
buick,rendezvous,2003,M Van Tiem, 12/02/2002,Happy Owner,4,"I researched several different SUVs and 
decided on a Trailblazer until I laid 
eyes on the RDV. This SUV has plenty of 
room for 2 adults and 2 kids, very 
comfortable seating, lots of storage 
areas, and the extras are very well 
thought out. The gas milage is a little 
less then the sticker says, however, 
mush beter then other SUVs in its 
class. All the controls are well placed 
for convienance and ease of use."
buick,rendezvous,2003,highmiler, 12/05/2002,Great vehicle,4,"I have never had a day that I haven't 
enjoyed this vehicle...oops, except the 
day the electricaal system went out 
completely (so ONSTAR of no use). It 
took ten days to get a new body 
computer module as the vehicle was so 
new. Never a single problem after that 
in 26,000 miles."
buick,rendezvous,2003,Bob Dixon, 12/19/2002,Rendezvous is a hit,4,"The Rendezvous is a very responsive and 
comfortable car to drive in the city

comfortable and the controls are 
ergonomically great for short and long 
trips.  Lots of room and very good gas 
mileage."
buick,rendezvous,2003,jimbo55, 12/30/2002,Try one and you'll buy one,5,"The ride is as smooth and quiet as any 
vehicle I've ever ridden in. Typical 
high Buick quality. Gets 23 mpg at 73 
mph, 18 around town. Power is good,  
just like a minivan. Very spacious 
inside.  Interior seems wide.  Very 
good sound system.  Many features 
available, many are safety related 
which exceed those available from most 
competitors."
buick,rendezvous,2003,James H. Packard, 01/04/2003,2002 Buick Rendezvous,4,"I have had the Rendezvous for about a 
year now and it's been fantastic.  The 
only problem was with the cd player 
and it was replaced.  The mileage has 
been very good for a vehicle of this 
size.  The ride quality has been 
great. This vehicle replaced a Ford 
Escape and the change was well worth 
it."

buick,rendezvous,2003,middrealtor, 02/03/2003,"Great luxury, not luxury price",5,"When you factor in the current 
incentives and rebates, this car is in 
the price range of a base model import 
midsize, but gives you way more for the 
money.  We love the traction control, 
safety of side airbags, style of the 
interior.  Not gaudy like most GM 
vehicles, but classy.  Not a 
barnstormer on performance, but more 
than adequate."
buick,rendezvous,2003,Liz Sihto, 02/07/2003,A terrific decision,5,"Our Buick Rendezvous is the MOST 
comfortable vehicle ... after test 
driving many models in this class, we 
decided to buy the buick.  Our 
decision was based on the most vehicle 
for the best price, but we were so 
pleasantly surprised it even surpassed 
our expectations.  Don't let anyone 
tell you different - this is a great 
vehicle. "
buick,rendezvous,2003,Sardone, 02/08/2003,I Love It!,5,"I've owned two Jeep Grand Cherokees in 
the past and was very close to buying 
another.  I saw the rebate for the 
Rendezvous and decided to take a test 
drive.  Although I wasn't sure I was 
ready to own a Buick because I've 
always equated this brand with old 
folks, I was extremely impressed with 
the ride and the features.  I don't 
regret my decision to buy one!"
buick,rendezvous,2003,bemri3, 02/10/2003,Good so far!,4,"Enjoying the new car--  Better gas 
milage than my Tahoe, but still not as 
good as I was hoping for.  Some road 
noise.  Love the interior design,  but 
hate the fabric pattern,  rather have 
solid color.  Same with outside - 
Rather have just one color."
buick,rendezvous,2003,David Flowers, 02/18/2003,Very satsified with this vehicle,4,"After a year and a half of ownership, my wife and I both really like the RV. We have had no problems. My wife is the main driver and she really likes the hands free cell phone as well as the good vision out the front. Interior design remains very convenient with the 3rd row seating being great to have when needed. Tinted windows in the back are nice but make backing up at night an exercise in blindness. Backup sensors in the rear bumper are nice in tight spots. We added some small convex mirrors to the side mirrors to get rid of a huge blind spot that was there despite the big mirrors. Engine power is borderline.That aside, we would buy the RV again. It continues to be a great ride!"
buick,rendezvous,2003,Rimshot1, 02/21/2003,...just purchased,4,"Great Deal with rebate(s) and working 
thru GM BuyPower (request a quote). One 
500 mile round trip in it and the ride 
was great and the performance adequate. 
It's not a rocket, but it's got a great 
ride and enough power for day to day 
events."
buick,rendezvous,2003,Meatloaf, 02/24/2003,West C,4,"This car has a very smooth ride along 
with comfortable seating. The third row 
seat is great. I have bucket/captain 
chair seating in all three rows. It 
looks luxurious throughout with the 
leather. I don't see any ""cheap"" 
looking materials, as I have read 
elsewhere. And it is peppy also. All I 
need now is a roof rack/pack for the 
suitcases. I a am looking forward to a 
trip with this beaut! Oh, and lest I 
forget, my wife can pour out the heat 
on Her side while I stay cool, 
hopefully, on my side with the dual 
controls for heat/cooling."
buick,rendezvous,2003,hwks1, 06/18/2003,Love the RDV,5,"Was looking for an SUV but wanted to 
keep van seating,configuration. The RDV 
is bigger than the Explorer,Pilot. RDV 
offers Captains charis second row,not 
Explorer,Pilot. RDV has 'back-up' 
sensor which is fabulous, didn't know I 
needed until I tried it! Same goes for 
the speed control volume on the RDV 
stereo, can't get that on 
Pilot,Explorer. And speaking of 
tereos.. the RDV ROCKS! There is much 
to do about RDV performance, Drive it 
and judge for yourself. If you want 
pinned in your seat acceleration skip 
the RDV. If you want a comfortable 
vehicle that accelerates smartly and 
delivers excellent (for this type 
vehicle) fuel economy then take a look 
at RDV. "
buick,rendezvous,2003,potentially happy, 07/26/2003,Adventure,4,"   Went on a cross-country family trip 
and encountered problems;  The service 
engine light stayed on after it was 
serviced and the fuel gauge and low 
fuel indicator light stayed on when 
the tank was full. The lighter and 
auxillary outlet fuse burned out.   
OnStar wasnt working either until we 
took the car to a Buick dealer to find 
these two outlets are on the same fuse 
as OnStar! Water collected on the 
floorboard in heavy amounts after 
rainfall. We came home from our trip 
to our dealer to find we had a leak 
around the air conditioning unit  They 
said it was a bad seal around the 
unit. We had water damage and 
corrosion to the electrical system. "

lots of class. "

remodeling, haul our boat and small 
camper, and at least 5 
passengers...this one does it all, plus 
last night I took out the one rear 
passenger seat and slept in the rear 
trunk area it at a friends cabin.  It 
was as inexpensive as our Buick Century 
and actually corners slightly better."

front wheels.  Does not get mileage as 
advertised (at least for the CXL)  Does 
not take rough roads well  Love the 
satellite radio (main reason I got the 
vehicle) plus that it has a fold away

For the money I think the cloth interior

sure.  Same engine as the Venture which

Avery Greene Motors and were very well 
taken care of by Bruce Rodger and Juan

and met our needs and our budget.

I liked the vehicle so much,I just 
bought one for myself to replace my

went for the Rendezvous. Best decision 
I ever made. Not only does it look 
great but it handles beautifully. We 
took it on vacation the day after we 
bought it, 5 hours in the car and 1 DVD 
system, not a peep out of the kids 
other than when it was time to change 
the movie. So comfortable, smooth ride, 
lots of leg room, great gas mileage, 
stereo system rocks. Maybe the engine 
could use to be a little more powerful, 
mostly at higher speeds, but most of us 
owners are people with kids.  Exactly 
how fast do we need to go?"

thought it was one of the most butt-
ugly SUVs I'd ever seen!! Thank GOD I 
was wrong!!!  After comparing it to all 
the other SUVs on the market, I've 
discovered the styling to be unique and 
beautiful!!  There are only 2 negative 
things I can say about it, it is a bit 
underpowered, (needs a V-8), and also 
gas mileage isn't so great.  But who 
cares?  You don't buy and SUV for it 
gas mileage!!  Thanks Buick, for 
building a truly unique and beautiful 
vehicle!"

The storage in the front console is roomy and holds just about anything.  The storage under the console is nice for CDs or maps.  The one drawback for me is the drivability in the snow.  This is the base model with traction control, although what traction it's controlling is beyond me.  I'm used to 4wd or awd vehicles, so this one is an adventure.  I would not recommend it for anyone who has to drive in ice/snow conditions. "

That in a nutshell is the good and bad of the Buick Rendezvous. I also own a BMW 325 convertible and when I drive that car I feel like I own the road. I'm king of the hill and a lot of people look at me with a glimmer of envy in their eyes. When I drive the Buick the only thing I'm King of is the radio and if people bother looking at me I feel like the only thing I see in their eyes is a look of pity and curiousity at the kind of person who would buy this funny looking SUV."
buick,rendezvous,2003,Niki Whitt, 02/18/2005,"OK, would not purchase another",3,"We have had our Buick in the shop SEVERAL times - for everything from brake problems, to a water leak, to a leak in the seal around the fuel tank.  I'm not sure if all the problems are with the car or the mechanics at the dealership.  Buick has been of no help what so ever.

in the Rendezvous. A couple of minor 
issues the dealer took care of promptly."
buick,rendezvous,2003,beanie235, 12/02/2003,God Bless America,3,"We chose a GM product because my spouse 
is a GM Employee but we chose the Buick 
(after previously owning a GM Minivan)
because the interior looked more 
expensive and Buick is known for making 
classier vehicles.  We've only had it 
for a few months but as a person who 
was stuck on minivans, I thoroughly 
enjoy it so far.  My spouse, who is not 
an SUV fan, wishes he had one for his 
own.  This SUV has as much storage room 
as my former extended minivan, which is 
good for a family of 4 with a dog who 
travel a lot.  Plenty of legroom and 
height in the front for tall people 
like myself."
buick,rendezvous,2003,Willem, 03/03/2003,Almost there,3,"With a better engine this car would be 
really fun to drive. The current 
engine is quiet and smooth, as if it 
isn't there; well that's almost the 
case. It should be possible to draw 40 
more horse power from a 3.4 liter 
engine I believe. This is clearly a 
new generation of Buick's though. Good 
roadholding and stiffer suspension. 
Well done, but it needs an engine 
upgrade. When listening to classical 
music, the Stereo suffers too much low-
mid frequency colouration."

of the 2002 model was average at best.  
I have owned it for five months now, 
and love the vehicle.  I have put 7,900 
miles on it in seven months, highway 
and city driving.  I have experienced 
no problems during that period.  It is 
great around town for a vehicle that

buick,rendezvous,2003,mayormcmisery, 01/06/2004,A good idea gone bad,2,"This vehicle does what it's designed 
to do, but not with the enthusiasm 
that GM touts. Our Rendezvous is a 
good people (mainly children) hauler 
and performs admirably in snowy 
conditions. Unfortunately, it is 
plagued with numerous rattles and 
mechanical defects due to poor 
workmanship. It stickered at $37,470 
and is now worth $16,000 with only 27k 
on the odometer, 1 1/2 years old, and 
in excellent shape. Driveability is 
only marginal, as trying to maintain 
highway speeds with it's anemic engine 
can produce a sore foot if the cruise 
control isn't used. The weak engine 
and high profile contribute to abysmal 
economy...17mpg average."

You won't find a better value in a seven passenger vehicle.   20 mpg rivals any full size SUV. It feels underpowered if you try to pass at speeds over 80, but I keep up on California Freeways.  Dual climate control and comfy seats make it perfect for long road trips.  Handles well in the snow and tows great."

everything about. it is a car that i 
can defintley grow into.  the only 
negative thing i have to say is about 
the gas mileage. i get about 19mpg. i 
guess this is good but my previos car 
was a neon so i'm used to 30mpg."
buick,rendezvous,2003,kristinka, 03/20/2004,I Like It,4,"I bought the vehicle after many months 
of soul searching for the right 
one...wanted plenty of room for the 
kids,my husband and myself.  The lack 
of power may be an issue for some, but 
I'm a mom driving my kids and friends 
not a racecar driver.  I find it to 
have plenty of room, comfort, and style 
with the leather interior and 
sun/moonroof I didn't go wrong!"

opinion, it's a sleeper in the SUV 
world--great vehicle for the money. 
Looks like a Lexus, but much cheaper 
and still great quality.  I enjoy 
driving it, and have plenty of room for 
my two golden retrievers. Two crates 
can easily fit in cargo area. So far, 
I've gotten 18.7 mpg for city driving. 
You can tell GM and Buick are working 
hard to build better quality vehicles

bigger than our Cavalier to haul our 3 
year old, 2 dogs, backpacking equipment 
and building supplies.  This vehicle 
was the perfect choice.  It is 
extremely comfortable, very nice ride, 
corners way better than a Cavalier and 
has TONS of storage space. My husbands 
dad works for GM, so the discounts and 
incentives we got on this vehicle are 
incredible.  The gas mileage is pretty 
darn good for an SUV, but what they 
don't tell you is how much less you get 
in the winter, granted this is MN, but 
I had no idea that the cold weather 
would have such an impact on the gas 
mileage.  Needless to say though, I 
love it!!"
buick,rendezvous,2003,Sposse, 05/24/2004,Shame on GM,2,"This vehicle is severely underpowered 
considering the poor gas mileage I get 
with it.  The interior is nice and 
spacious.  The passenger rear door 
often doesn't close properly and hasn't 
since the day I bought it.  GM says 
it's an air pressure issue?!?  Finally, 
I had the roof rack rip off at 40 mph 
loaded within owner's manuals specs.  
Again GM claims no responsibility."
buick,rendezvous,2003,D.B., 08/01/2004,Don't buy it!,1,"This expensive SUV is a dog with a 
jerky GM transmission, shoddy interior 
construction, high body repair costs, 
wrose-than-usual SUV rear blind spots, 
and a ""tippy"" high center of gravity.  
I inherited this from a relative, had 
to have a deep, long scratch on the 
driver's side repaired (total cost over 
$5K), and then traded it in (in 
excellent condition after repair, with 
low mileage) for $3000 less than Blue 
Book.  Why do you think they're giving 
$5000 rebates on the 2005s?  Nobody 
will buy these things, and I wouldn't 
be suprised if they are discontinued 
soon.  It's an Edsel, folks!"

surprisingly positive fuel economy.  I 
have been nothing but pleased with this

Although I bought and have 0% for 5

Rendezvous before they stop making 
them! "

very comfortable, the seats are soo 
soft.  It handles well.  The gas 
mileage, well, I get 250 mi to a tank 
in the city a little more on the hwy.  
My biggest disappointment was that I 
was told that I could purchase the 3rd 
row seat later.  However, when I went 
back to purchase it, I was told that 
you can not purchase the 3rd row seat 
after the fact it must be purchased 
when you purchase the vehicle.  I have 
called Buick, GMAC and many dealerships 
and this is the case.  So if you have a 
CX model and want the 3rd row seat, you 
will have to have it installed by 
someone who customizes trucks."
buick,rendezvous,2003,Mike, 12/31/2004,Better than I thought,4,"I purchased this SUV for my wife and 
she totally loves it. I have grown to 
appreciate it as well except for the 
sqeaks from the dash that the dealer 
says they cannot hear?? I bought this 
one with almost every option 
available. It would have been simpler 
to purchase a CXL that has the same 
options standard!"
buick,rendezvous,2003,Chad, 02/05/2005,What was I thinking?,1,"Bought it fully loaded for $34K. In two years the trade-in value is $13K. YIKES! This vehicle is a horrible value, and way under powered. Only 185hp. Can you say 'slug'? Third row is useless. We have to have people go in from the back and climb over the seat. Not too functional. And when the seat is up, you can only fit a couple of bags behind the seat. Have been trying to work some magic and trade it in for a 2005 Odyssey. But I really don't want to eat $6K on the trade! Looks like I will have to hang in there for a little longer and try to get it even. Please do not buy a Rendezvous! Do your checkbook and your family a favor and buy something with lasting value and function!"

first 15,000 mile with nothing but 
sheer pleasure and enjoyment of the 
vehicle. Tested in the Mountains of 
Virginia and other ""challenging""

perfect - very intelligent and fast in 
deep snow in the mountains as well as 
heavy rain in the city. Very driver-

buick,rendezvous,2003,autoworker239, 11/15/2005,Not Buicks best effort,2,"This vehicle is plagued with problems ranging from annoying to down right dangerous. Newer versions have corrected some of the problems but some of the more serious ones still remain including premature wheel hub failures, faulty wiring and bad transmissions. If you insist on buying one you'd better purchase the extended warranty and towing insurance because you're going to need it."
buick,rendezvous,2003,RebeccaD, 11/14/2005,Disappointed,3,"Love at first sight. Problems after manufacturer warranty expired have included failure & replacement of both front tire hubs (one of them replaced twice), Power steering pump replaced three times, Heater control unit shorted out. I have filed a safety complaint w/NHTSA lots more there, please read. Buick Rendezvous has had a lot of problems. Through persistant investigation on my part, I've found that the tire hub appears to be defective, GM is now getting this part from a new supplier.  At first we loved this car but will never buy another Rendezvous maybe never another Buick at all.  The dealership has been good & has made all repairs at no cost to us even though we are past the mileage warranty."

Had to have the fuel tank gauge sensor replaced and also the Intake Manifold was just replaced due to leaking back into the engine. So much for the 110 point GM Certified Inspection. I have also been having issues with starting the veh as the ignition doesn't want to release once the vehicle is started, it sometimes continues to crank. I was told that this is normal in GM products manufactured since 2003. Not sure that we will ever buy a Buick product again. "
buick,rendezvous,2003,Jamie, 01/27/2006,I love this car/suv/wagon.,4,I bought this car to have more space for my growing family but I wanted something that was comfortable and not in the van family. I am young and I desire a car that is nice looking and doesn't make me look old. This car is awesome on long road trips. It is so comfortable and it rides like a luxury car. It is elegant and worth the money.
buick,rendezvous,2003,Brian Bryans, 03/02/2006,Junk,1,"We have had several mechanical issues on our Rendevous. This first was a transmission problem that kept the car in 3rd gear. This was repaired under warranty. We had to replace the tires at 20,000 miles and Buick would not prorate the tires because we did not have full paperwork showing that we had rotated the tires.Our most recent problem was with a check engine light. The light came on with 43,000 miles on the car, 7k miles out of warranty.It ended up being that water was getting into the car under the carpet and had rusted sensors. The dealership had to strip all the interior out and fix the problem. Cost $1200. There is no wonder GM is on the verge of bankruptcy!  "
buick,rendezvous,2003,Don, 03/22/2006,Great Buick,4,"I drive a lot of freeway miles and have found this vehicle to be quite comfortable and fairly easy on gas.  I bought the base model and recommend the upgrade to the safety equipment: side air bags, anti lock brakes, and traction control. I believe they are worth the money and the vehicle list at around $28,500 with the options.  However, you can push this vehicle up to around $34,000 with a lot a gadgets that are worth as on most vehicle about 40% of what you pay for them. If you want a good value stay near the base with those options that you really want. My biggest concern with this and most all vehicles of it's type is the lack a good way to secure luggage and other items in the rear area"
buick,rendezvous,2003,Christopher Ordner, 04/15/2006,Buick Rendezvous,4,"Get great gas mileage and perfect features for my family of six.

Only used it a minimum amount of times but it was worth it each time we needed it.  It was the highest maintenance cost vehicle we have had in about 15 years. As much as I liked the feel and ride, will not buy another one because of the maintenance cost."

tall and likes lots of leg room and 
this SUV has plenty. The salesman said 
that we could take a test drive for a 
couple hours (imagine that) to see if 
it was the right car. We'll we drove 
for an hour but had made up our minds

The full size pickups have less head room. During warranty they changed 3 front wheel bearings, stereo speakers and 2 starters. Now at 88,000 miles the intake manifold gasket is bad and I am getting quotes from $400.00 to $1200. A piece of Mexican made junk!"

daily driver to work and carting the 
family around on the weekends 
occassionally.

Great stereo system i have the 6 disc 
upgrade system and if I thoght it 
would help top drop $$ on a better 
stereo, but it does not need it.

My biggest problem with the car is the 
wheels are a bit small for it...it 
could use 17/265.  The soft suspension 
is great for driving around, but is a 
bit squishy in the corners.

It is a great looking car and very 
comfortable inside."
buick,rendezvous,2003,Rick Olsen, 04/08/2003,Rendezvous smelling like a lemon...,3,"My experience with this vehicle has 
gone from good to very bad, such that I 
wouldn't recommend it. After 1 month 
the engine developed a pinging noise 
upon acceleration. The dealer has made 
every attempt to correct it, but is at 
a loss as to what the problem could be. 
The GM rep. was consulted who stated 
this engine noise is a characteristic 
of these engines, even though the 
dealer has never had or heard of this 
problem before. Its GM's stance to not 
fix it or do anything about it, likely 
because there so-called engineers 
couldn't even engineer there way out of 
a paper bag. I would have thought a 
company like GM would at least stand 
behind there products."
buick,rendezvous,2003,mjlens, 04/09/2003,A great buy,4,"This vehicle is an eye catcher. The 
interior is an eye catcher and adds to 
a very comfortable ride. Easy handling 
in city and country driving. The fold 
up and pull out of the 2nd row seats 
give more storage space than I have 
seen in many suv's. The Rendezous rides 
with the same comforte as the Buick 
Century that I Own. It also has the 
power when you need it. I am very glad 
that I researched and compaired this 
vehicle with other suv's and decided on 
this one."

Can you believe transmission problem at 63,000K.One problem after the another. Tapping noise in the morning and the dealer says it is normal. Does not have enough power. Going on the hill looks likes 4 cylinder car will do better. Bad mileage. Noise from the front wheel, had to replace both bearings. Back latch recall. It should be discontinued. I should have listen to my friend and bought some Japenese car instead. I will never recommend this junk to anybody."

Going up to ski country was a breeze 
during blizzard conditions, the AWD 
working seemlessly. (ABS worked quite 
well too when I practicing my panic 
stops with no one around.) The heads up 
display always kept me aware of the 
speed for the conditions. Very 
comfortable for long trips.  Being 6' 
tall, the 3rd row seat had plenty of 
room for me.  
Gas mileage was a little lower than 
expected for city driving (~ 13 MPG) 
but highway was fine (~ 24 MPG).  The 
engine could use a bit more power (only 
185 HP).
0% financing was a great incentive and

First was the Security light kept coming on, was told it was a battery problem but to have the diagnostics on the vehicle checked out was costly just to have to change the battery. Next was the window, went down wouldn't go back up cost me$430 to get the regulator replaced. I've read a lot on the Rendezvous and the windows are a hugh problem and very costly. Also, not nearly enough room in the driver's seat and the seatbelts are not roomy enough and the radio keeps changing stations. We have been very disappointed so far and hope this SUV doesn't end up costing us a fortune."

Can't believe this thing made it 
through the wind tunnel in the design 
phase - it's the noisiest car I've ever 
owned.  Severe fluttering wind noise 
around the windows, dealer unable to 
locate or correct.  Loud around the 
windshield due to design.  Outside 
noise sounds like it's inside the car!

Replaced front wheel bearings at 42,000 and 45,000 miles.  The head gasket was replaced last month at 83,000 miles after dealer misdiagnosed the problem twice.  The load leveler would not stop running (at 75,000 miles) so we pulled the fuse and replaced it to stop the noise.  Dealer advised that unless we fix it, the rear air-filled shocks will fail.  We have already spent too much replacing things too soon.  Recently replaced rear wheel bearings (great design those sealed bearings, not!).  It is currently at the dealer again for other problems.  So sorry we bought this.  No more GMs."
buick,rendezvous,2003,jb, 04/12/2008,What a mistake,3,"Mechanically the worst car I ever owned. The only saving grace was that I purchased the 100K mile warranty. Otherwise it would have cost me thousands in repairs after 60K mile warranty expired. Front wheel bearings (known issue), intake manifold (known issue), excessive inside tire wear (alignments did not help), heater blower (3 times), sheared bolts and head replacements."
buick,rendezvous,2003,Karma, 04/22/2008,Never Again!!,2,"Bought this Buick brand new for my wife and just traded it in. Took a huge loss but was glad just to get rid of it. Ball joints, transmission, engine gaskets,etc. Left us stranded on the road at least 6 times. Would not start after you shut it off. Dealer said it was a switch but I told them it was the fuel pump. Changed switch 3 times and still the same hunk of junk. Traded it in with only 40,000 miles on it. Lift gate latch had to be replaced and the windows wouldn't work. Trash, trash, trash. Never again GM, never again. I should have learned my lesson after the Jimmy I bought. I will drive a Kia before I ever by a GM!!!"

buick,rendezvous,2003,Dave , 08/09/2019,Excellent cargo space and comfort in a mid SUV!,5,"My first SUV and I loved it!! Handles well, very comfortable ride. No small seats, and plenty of headroom, my husband is 6'4''...the exterior mirrors are large, and compared to other cars,really cuts out the blind spot.Windows are also large as are the doors for easy entry. Used my SUV without the two removable captains chairs. They bolt I in and out easily, but I like the space for bikes,luggage, and pets. There is a third row seat that is comfortable and can be folded down. I used the OnStar communications that is available, and did not miss GPS or movie systems because I use Google maps and the kids play on their phones. The tires and stainless steel exhaust were replaced in 2017, the car was parked inside and has minimal rust. Brakes lines front to back installed 2018. Solid, well built vehicle for the price, rides like a luxury car. I have retired and downsizing to a smaller vehicle.

There is one design flaw that needs to be fixed: Speedometer has a silver background and black numbers.
During dawn/twilight, it is nearly impossible to see the numbers. The black fades into the silver. During these light conditions, there is no way to see my speed and other guages."

buick,rendezvous,2004,Beth - like the KISS song, 11/29/2017,"the ""Buick""",5,"I love my Rendezvous. It is a 2004 AWD and will soon celebrate her 14th Bday.  I chuckle at the Buick commercials about 'not your grandma's Buick', as I have grandpups.  Such a smooth ride.  I love driving it.  I sorted reviews in date order prior to mine, the man mentioned a wet floor. If his came off same line as mine, that is a factory defect, I learned this in 2014. Always had wet carpet but I had a garage. Then I moved and it was outside, got very wet.  I think because i lived in Iowa and had snowy feet, went thru 100 year floods about every year,  and lived on a  muddy gravel road, i chalked it up to that. The seal was not tight on the window. The GM dealer had the window guy work on it, not a problem.   I live in Iowa, in 2016 I drove it to Pueblo, Colorado to my sisters for Thanksgiving.  On the way home I hit 170,000 miles in Lincoln, NE.  Averaged about 20 mpg.  Prior to that (with high mileage) I drove it to Mall of America twice. I loaded it up with stuff my daughter wanted from IKEA and it fit in the back end well.  I have never worried about reliability.  Repairs have been wheel bearings, which is a known problem to GM on this model. I think at about 130,000 the differential fluid dripped off the back, so some gaskets or seals were replaced - since took it in right away, no major damage done. Had the tranny fluid and radiator flushed at this time.  At 160,000 the oil pan was replaced along with the transmission fluid lines.  In 2016 a new tire rod on on right side (pot hole side of the road)  and in 2017 a muffler.  Registration is $51/year,   runs like a dream and I will keep it for a very long time.  I was told I got the ""good engine"". Has the best heater and a/c unit you could want.  I take care of her, and she takes care of me :)  :)  :)

It's fully loaded (CXL), although it's missing roughly 4-5 features. As far as reliability goes, it's not that bad. It starts up every single time no matter how cold it is. Sadly it's starting to break down. Within the past 6 years, parts have been going out, or just not working at all. But hey it's a 10 year old car, and the parts are not going to last forever. The Rendezvous is a great SUV, and I recommend it to anyone with a large family. Gas mileage isn't that bad either, my gma averages 23-26 (80% city driving/20% hwy driving)."
buick,rendezvous,2004,big dawg, 10/01/2010,It's falling apart,3,"I had hoped to keep this car for a long time but it's slowly falling apart. Part of it is the salt in our region. The rotors rust and wear out the brakes/rotors prematurely. The bearing hubs have been replaced. Control arm bushings don't last and the AWD actuator had to be replaced.The racheting device on the seatbelts caused the belts to tear and need to be replaced. It's constantly being repaired and I no longer trust it except for trips around town. The quality of the suspension/drive train parts is not good. It does have a nice ride and nice stereo and room to take my 90 lb German Shepherd but I think I may look at a Nissan, Toyota or Honda to replace it.  American cars= no good."
buick,rendezvous,2004,Mark B., 02/06/2018,"Best riding, comfortable SUV I have driven.",4,"Bought with 120,000 miles on it. Had intermittent check engine light which 3 different garages could not figure out the problem out. Turn out to be Thrust bearing in transmission which spewed needle bearings into trans which destroyed gears and torque converter; $4,000 repair. Had to change speed sensor 3 times due to Garage using after market parts: Use Genuine GM parts for Traction and anti-lock problems. Power steering pump does not provide enough boost at idle speed, i.e. parking situations. As other reviews state, gauges are unreadable during daytime due to background color, a problem made worse by a problem with panel lights dimming system which causes instrument lights to go dim during daylight when car is shifted out of Park. Had instrument cluster rebuilt and change light sensor. Dealer advised me I would have to put new radio in to solve problem(Whaaaaaat?). All that said, it is a great riding, comfortable car. After my experience with a '99 Tahoe, bought new, I too am finished with GM cars. They just can't seem to get their act together as Ford, Nissan, Toyota, Subaru, etc. have over the last decade.

The only thing it's missing is the HUD. It's very easy to steer, the steering is basically like the old Cadillacs back in the day. (There steering was very smooth you could move it with just a finger) My most favorite thing of it is the factory exhaust sound. The 3.4 V6 exhaust is awesome! The torque is great too! It's 210 ft/lb @ 4,000 rpm. In reality the torque comes in between 1,800-4,000 rpm. It's a great SUV, and I recommend it to anyone! The cost to insure it, is VERY cheap!"

The fuel lines are rotten and trying to get the parts seems to be impossible, GM has a national backorder, the car has been there for a week. When I called Buick and GM they keep insinuating that the car should be at a dealership. I feel frustrated and like I am going around a corporate spiral swirling around and around never getting anywhere.

The car seems to be slowly falling apart and breaking piece by piece. The AWD Disabled light comes on at least 4-7 times monthly which is indicating that the cars wheel bearing has been broken so the wheels could potentially lock up at any given moment while driving. The air conditioning vents have been leaking gas fumes into my car even though I have taken it to get fixed many times for that reason. So many things are wrong with this car so don't bother buying one and save your money for a Non Buick automobile. "

However, after seeing so many SUVs with the boring dark gray interior we finally looked at one and fell in love the with spacious interior, comfortable captain seats and smooth ride.  A year into ownership we started experiencing issues. Both wheel bearings went under 60,000 miles costing $400 each.  Break pads and rotors had to be changed every 6-9 months because they kept warping (another pricey repair). The handle on the rear hatch door broke as well, making it harder for my wife to close.  The nail in the coffin was the transmission starting to slip at just 71,000 miles!"

The vehicle averages about 21 mpg with the commute everyday. I have had to replace the left and right front  power window regulators ($500 at the dealer-$289 at my mechanic)  Then last month the power rear hatch assembly broke and cost another $300 to repair. Hatch assembly was originally covered under a recall but once it was performed in 2004 that ""Closed out the recall"" and this one's on me. They put in a faulty part and it's my fault!  I had the same window problem with my 2001 Bonneville, right and left rear regulators had to be replaced.I'm entitled to GM supplier pricing but will think twice before buying another GM"
buick,rendezvous,2004,pa, 10/15/2008,Good value,3,"I've had this car for 4 years. I'll be honest, it is a boring car. Yes, the interior is plasticy (which, after 4 years, has certainly worn down to the point of needing some sort of paint repair) and the exterior isn't exciting either. But, with that said, it has been a very reliable car. I've had one repair in 90K miles which I'm sure is pretty rare. The third row has been very convenient for the extra- people situations that pop up (and yes, adults can fit back there). You feel safe in this car.  "

The only work that has ever been done is routine maintenance.  We have blown a few fuses with various electronic equipment, but they are easy to replace ourselves. From a style standpoint, we have gotten a few jabs over the years from our younger friends who think it looks like a van.  This was our first Buick, and although they have a reputation for being popular among the over 60 crowd, you can't beat the reliability.  "

Was never crazy about the exterior design, but the interior is what I see most, and I love it. Got great mileage until recently (probably need to change fuel filter or something). I'll be passing this car onto my daughter when she turns 16 next year, and feel good that she'll be in a safe, reliable car. I've been spoiled, and I'm not sure I can ever return to a sedan! "

Great visibility in the front windshield, in fact that is why I purchased this car.  The vista is great when traveling to beautiful places, panoramic view. My whole family loves this car, and I am a 76 year old grandmother, and everyone wishes they owned this car.

Found the Buick online. Took it in for a full tune up per the previous owner's suggestion the day I bought it. It currently has at 255,7xx miles on it. Its runs super smooth and quiet. Its very comfortable. Only mid-major repairs needed over the last year were the alternator, starter, and wheel hub assemblies in the front ($610 total spent including the tuneup).

Has room similar to a minivan, but with better handling, and a 3rd row seat. The 3.6L engine is unusually advanced for a GM product; behaves more like a Honda motor and pulls my 21ft bass boat with no trouble. No problems with the climate control system or AWD powertrain. Wheel bearings wore out relatively early and recently the pneumatic ride control system quit. Fuel economy is not that great, but the VVT mechanism is sensitive to oil quality, and I suspect the O2 sensors have exceeded their life expectancy.

I am at 75,000 miles and I have had zero problems mechanically or otherwise. On top of that, this loaded model gives the driver and my family every accommodation. Heated seats, AWD, heads up display, moonroof, third row of seats, towing capability, comfort, power everything, rear park assist, lots of room and storage. It is sleek and stylish and has zip!

It has a lot of room in the back, as we don't have the 3rd row seat. The seats fold down completely, and you can easily and quickly remove the entire back seat to open up even more room  My wife really appreciates all the storage up front, and the steering wheel audio controls are nice also.

I have had no mechanical problems just normal maintenance in 37,000 miles of driving. The only dissapointment is that I get 15 MPG local driving and just 18 MPG highway driving. However, the excellent visibility with the sloped front hood and large side mirrors makes the SUV fun to drive. My wife loves this SUV and the relatively low step up height makes it easy to enter and leave this vehicle. GM may be having its financial problems but it hit an affordable home run with this SUV model. The Enclave is a very attractive replacement for Rendezvous but is too large!"

buick,rendezvous,2004,notagain, 04/06/2007,2004 not what I read in research,2,"I am not the first to experience this and only with this car, but around 60,000 miles the bearings go. Starts off not bad, then gets increasingly annoying. Then the O2 sensors both go and fuel injection not doing well around 90,000.  My avg. mileage mostly hywy during the spring and fall around 20. Winter and Summer 18 maybe a little worse, not anywhere close to 24.  Also makes a lot of wind noise when wind is hitting from passanger side of car.  I do like the interior space and fact that seats are like van seats and can be taken out."
buick,rendezvous,2004,Betty Finney, 05/11/2007,Well made SUV!,4,"I bought my 2004 Rendevous 1-07 with 24000 miles on it. I love it! I have a new grandbaby. Loading the car seat and stroller in was the selling factor for me. When I upgrade to a new vehicle, I will upgrade to a newer model of the Rendevous."
buick,rendezvous,2004,mellowsong, 06/15/2007,2004 Buick Rendezvous,4,"I absolutely love this vehicle. It has been virtually trouble free since purchase, is extremely comfortable for me (I have a severe back injury) and has plenty of get up and go. My only complaint is gas mileage, but I knew that when I bought it.  I actually get better than stated. I would recommend this to anyone."
buick,rendezvous,2004,Sassy, 08/10/2007,Paint it Yellow,2,"What a lemon! Back hatch lock broke, the handle to close the hatch broke, the pumps that raise a lower the back hatch have broken several times. Switch has locked up several times, overhead sunglasses compartment has been replaced twice because it has fallen down and just hangs there. Battery didn't even last the first year. The front end doesn't stay aligned, 2 new tires, now it looks like we will have to put on another 2 tires. The upholstery is stained, not scotchguarded at all. I thought Buick was top of the line, well, the one we got is at the end of the line. Will definitely not buy another GM product, will go with Honda or Toyota. Had to buy extended warranty just to stay afloat"
buick,rendezvous,2004,New Driver, 03/28/2008,Best Luxury SUV/Minivan,4,"This is the best SUV I have ever owned. The traction control works like a pro. The ultrasonic parking aid is help, because I like to back up in my driveway, and there is a gate and it lets me know when I am close enough. The third row seat is a nice addtion as well. The front seats are first class. The rear seats a first class as well they recline, and and you can push them forward and back."
buick,rendezvous,2004,ziebab, 05/20/2008,Perfect,4,"Bought used with 24,000 miles. It has been the perfect SUV for us. Tried out a Ford Escape after we test drove the Buick, not even close, plus the Escape was more money.  My wife loves the Rondezvous. Lots of room all around, easy access to everything, great vision, comfort, reliablity, ride is slightly rough but not a big deal.  No major problems, just the usuall maint. One ignition problem but covered by warranty. We are at 65000 miles, just put on a new set of tires, running great and still  looks like new. Too bad they discontinued them, would buy another one when the time comes."
buick,rendezvous,2004,Pete Hulett, 07/06/2008,Disappointed,4,"I had problems with the ignition from the start.  This Buick refused to start and was at the garage three times for this and they could not find the problem. I moved and it stopped moving day and was repaired in a city. worked 6 months and did it again. They reprogramed the keys this time. Now just this month it did it again.  Well this time it was the fuel pump - only 41000 miles and its gone $611 to repalce, thnk goodness for extened warranty.  I have owned Buick for 20 yrs with no issues like this. My last Buick had 172,000 and no issues. There will not be another one after this one. Have to keep it as no one's buying them now. Just waiting to see what is going next."
buick,rendezvous,2004,john, 01/06/2005,Another great Buick Value,4,"Traded in my first new Buick, a 1996 Skylark that I was outgrowing. Wanted something bigger that could handle cargo, etc.  Test drove the Dodge Magnum-was expensive, and only 70 cu fr of cargo capacity-passengers sit low with high windo sill. Liked the Rendezvous, and took advantage of rebate and good trade in on my 9 yo Skylark.  I would not consider it if I had to pay $35k list price (paid $23k) as it lacks power lift gate and refined engines other competitiors offer.  Some interior pieces feel cheap.  But, overall, for $23k, is great deal!!"
buick,rendezvous,2004,wayne chambers, 07/06/2006,"Eats tires , noisy",3,Drives very well. Good gas mileage. Has much more room than most SUVs. After 1 year the rear tires became so noisy the radio was useless. Dealer said this was common on the Rendezvous. Tthey rotated the tires. It took only 3k miles to ruin the other 2 tires. Next excuse was that the Firestone tires don't work well on this SUV. Will consider another make or dealer next time.
buick,rendezvous,2004,Salesman, 04/30/2009,Going for 200k with this baby!,4,"This is the 3rd Buick we've owned and we're only 50!! All in all it's been a family favorite, a workhorse and a great value. I drive about 100 miles a day in the Reno-Tahoe area. Coming from New England this is one of the best cars in the snow I've seen. Very easy to drive. Lean back, put it in cruise and listen to the BoSox on XM! Grandkids love the third seat. Peole have been amazed at how much you can pack into it with the seats down. Had some warrantee work done which is norm with new models. One of the best cars for a long trip and one of the best I've owned. Previously owned Volvo, Chevy, Ford, GMC. I plan on putting 180k on this and it's doing it just fine."

Middle seat has insufficient cup

buick,rendezvous,2004,nancylandas, 07/17/2003,SUVs for GRANDMAs OFFER GREAT FUN!,4,"After researching for the perfect car
for five or six years and finding that
Buick Rendezvous always came out in the
top six, I test drove one, but found two
problems:
1. It bothered my left leg while I drove
2. The price was higher than I wanted to
pay.  The dealership, FX Caprara was
wonderful and I designed my own car, but
then we could not agree on price. While
visiting Texas I drove several and found
the perfect price and purchased my
Rendezvour, which I love. Gas mileage
has improved, but I had hoped for the
maximum suggested which maybe Iwill
still achieve."
buick,rendezvous,2004,JAZZ, 07/25/2003,Love it!!,4,"The Rendezvous is the best SUV with 
minivan qualities!  I highly recommend 
it.  The bucket seats in the back are 
great and the DVD player is a big hit 
with my son.  It's a great car if you 
only have 2 kids.  If you have 3 that 
are older then it would be ok too.  Not 
enough room in the cargo area for a 
stroller, you have to put the 3rd row 
down."
buick,rendezvous,2004,Dave K, 08/01/2003,Large and efficient,5,"Rendezvous is GM's best-kept secret. 
Quieter, better riding and larger than 
most midsize SUVs. Better fuel economy 
than Highlander, yet about as large 
inside as an Expedition. Interior has 
no squeaks or rattles and is definitely 
one of GM's higher-quality executions. 
At 6'6 and 240 pounds, Explorer and 
TrailBlazer seemed cramped for me, but 
the Vous feels open and roomy. Most 
will say the engine needs more power, 
but it adequate and actually pretty 
punchy around town (remember, this is a 
wagon not a Corvette!). People I have 
shown it to love it. So far my mother, 
brother and wife's friend have all 
bought Rendezvous. "

enough of a SUV to be interesting and 
fun.  I love mine.  "
buick,rendezvous,2004,zzpj2y, 09/04/2003,Versatility plus!,4,"Highly pleased.  Very appealing in and 
out.  Very versatile.  Storage 
compartments are a plus. Layout of 
console very convenient.  Able to haul 
4 foot wide panels in back. (OK, the 
4x8 sheets stick out a little in the 
back.)  Though the seats appear to be 
slender and that can equate to not 
being comfortable for long trips, the 
looks are deceiving, as the comfort 
level is high.  Nice total package for 
the price!"
buick,rendezvous,2004,stina, 09/07/2003,Buyer beware,3,"Loved the look of this car at the auto 
show - ordered it right away.  I will 
never buy another car that is a new 
model again.  We had extra speakers 
from the factory that never worked.  At 
36,400 miles, we had to replace the 
front wheel bearing.  At 46,500 miles 
(25 months old) the electrical system 
had corrosion due to a leak at the 
windshield - cost us $333.00 to replace 
what is obviously a manufacturer 
defect - the car has been in no 
accidents and we never off-road.  Also, 
the dealer was no help whatsoever and 
kept telling us we should have gotten 
the extended warranty.  "

cyl monster that rides like a pickup 
and gets 10 miles to the gallon? SUV 
does mean Sport Utility Vehicle, and 
that is exactly what this is...and it's 
a more luxurious ride than most For a 
family that has outgrown a van and 
wants something snazzy but still with 
the benefits of carrying kids n cargo, 
this is a great choice. The ride is 
luxurious, with ON STAR it is safe, and 
since i'm not planning on riding the 
Apallachial Trail the All Wheel Drive 
is more than adequate. This rides 
better than the Honda Pilot, the 
highest rated mid size SUV. Before you 
buy anything, test drive this. you'll 
enjoy floating down the road."
buick,rendezvous,2004,yru, 08/09/2003,Excellent Value,4,"This car is a a fantastic value.  For 
the sizable savings, one can get a 
beautiful SUV that is the equal of up-
market models such as the Lexus RX300 
and other competitors such as the Acura 
MDX.  There is not a single feature 
available on up-market models that is 
not available on the Rendez-vous, 
including DVD player and HIGHLY 
intuitve and highly adaptive navigation 
system.

In styling the Rendez-vous outstrips 
the aformentioned in the elegantly 
simple and intuitive layout.  Like the 
layout the numerous luxury amenties are 
likewise simple to use.  Having never 
used it before, I learned how to use 
all it's numerous functions in 4

buick,rendezvous,2004,Schnauzer, 12/21/2004,2004 Rendezvous CXL AWD,3,"Just bought this car because of the year end closeout and rebates.  Got an awesome price.  This is my second Buick. So far, so good.  The space is great and all the features that came with it are really functional and neat. The 3.5L or 3.6L engine should be the standard.  The 3.4L is now old technology.  It feels like a very safe vehicle with all the airbags and crumple zones designed into it.  I got the fold down third row seat which is handy and recommended."
buick,rendezvous,2004,TainoRico, 10/04/2003,Disgrace to the Buick tradition,2,"Absolutely disappointing.  As a

such a poor performing vehicle.  
Whenever I come across anyone who asks 
me about this vehicle I say turn around

I am anxiously waiting to get rid of it

I have been extremely pleased with it, and have driven it on two long and challenging trips, as well as around town.  I like the room, comfort and handling.  Lots of space for child and the many trips to the home improvement store.  I would purchase it again in a minute, and have not regretted my purchase in the least."

single woman and need the cargo area 
for things like plants, moving smaller 
antiques and light hauling.  The

little off-road requirements, I've found
driving Rendezvous quite pleasant. I
love its smooth ride, excellent gas
mileage (I got 21 mpg with avearge of 38

On-Star system. AWD just starts giving

don't want a car and defiantely not 
another van, yet the gas mileage on a 
powerful SUV is terrible. This SUV fits

pricey on gas but nothing major."

controls seem to be weel placed.  Get

it."

brakes installed.  Also the hubs for the all 
wheel drive needed to be replaced at 19,000 
miles.

back hatch opens when a bump is hit on the 
road.

hatch will not go all the way up (keep hitting 
your head)  lift shocks were changed at 3000

originals did"

quality."
buick,rendezvous,2004,m103280, 02/07/2004,Evaluation from a layman,4,"This is the first GM product I have 
purchased in 48 years.  The price, 
comfort, and options were all 
persuaders in the transition from 
Toyota, Honda, and Nissan.  My only 
criticism is that Buick consider a 
larger powertrain (and apparently they 
did in the new Ultra version).  The 
leather appointed heated seats are 
extremely comfortable on a New England 
winter day."

thought it was the most butt-ugly SUV I 
ever saw!!   Until I drove one!  Then I 
noticed that it is a uniquely designed 
SUV and has the ride of a luxury car!  
I absolutely LOVE it!!"
buick,rendezvous,2004,JimDaddy, 02/07/2004,2004 Rendezvous CLX,4,"This vehicle's ride is very similar to 
the ride we experienced in our 2000

with a larger V-6"
buick,rendezvous,2004,Perry Kravec, 02/10/2004,Engineers vehicle....,5,"This is a Two Year review...
25K in severe duty... and doing very
well...  the gas milage for a vehicle
that weighs over 4,000lbs with 185HP is
as good as a VW beetle that had 85HP...
26mpg on the road.... goig to  work and
back I'm getting 22mpg ... that's more
than the 4cyl CRV my cooworker is
getting driving the same route. Needless
to say this vehicle was designed for my
taste.. its roomy as a full size SUV but
gets the gas milage of a much smaller
vehicle... all the seats come out easily
just like a minivan for more cargo space
than any SUV... and the ride is smooth
and quiet. The large 16"" wheels take the
rough roads around here very well. Very
satisfied."
buick,rendezvous,2004,Ron2004, 02/11/2004,Rende-view,4,"Our Rendevous has provided us with the 
room to travel.  My wife needs a wheel-
chair when we go off in unknown 
territory since she is a stroke 
survivor.  With our car, that limited 
us as to what we could take on trips 
because the chair took up so much 
space. Now we have plenty of room. 
  
The car was also hard for her to get in 
and out of but the Rendevous is the 
perfect height."
buick,rendezvous,2004,Pat Coles, 02/14/2004,Best Kept Secret,4,"Going from a Park Avenue to this was 
not a disappointment. Roomy and 
comfortable, love the Navagation 
System; On-Star; Satellite Radio is 
great.

Fuel mileage is one of its major 
problems; the other being a heavy rear 
hatch to open and close. Why not make 
it auto like everyone else's? Larger 
engine = more power and probably better 
fuel mileage.

I consistantly use the ""heads-up"" 
display and raely look at the dash. But 
please, I can barely read the clock it 
is so small. Why not incorportate it 
with the ""heads-up""?"

buick,rendezvous,2004,levedr, 02/05/2004,What they missed,4,"The R.is the ""big brother"" to the 
lesser appreciated Aztec. Buick 
could've paid more attention to some of 
the features of its ""lil bro"". I own 
both cars, having bought the Rendezvous 
as a family car after being impressed 
by my Aztec which I had owned for two 
years. I was dissapointed, however, in 
some things overlooked by the engineers 
of Buick.Sound system-hey, what would 
it cost to put in those nice Pioneer 
speakers?Rear seat ""fold down"" the 
little lever in the ""Az"" is much easier 
to use..and do the ""Az"" seats really 
fold easier, or is it my imagination, 
both cars would benefit from 
the ""spring loaded"" nature used on 
other GM SUVs"
buick,rendezvous,2004,Kristine, 02/18/2004,Our Buick,4,"We purchased our Rendezvous after much 
consideration and deciding we weren't 
ready for a van, but wanted the room 
and convenience of one.  We knew we 
wanted better gas mileage than a 
traditional SUV, but didn't want a 
compact.  We were sold after the first 
test drive.  The comfort, the little 
extras, the storage...all great with 
the most smooth and quiet ride ever!  
We call it our utility vehicle, having 
no intention to use it road, it serves 
our every family utility and is simply 
beautiful inside and out."

If your looking for minivan

Rndezvous and can say it is performing
perfect. And I'm very pleased with the
gas miliage for a vehicle that weighs
over 4,000lbs and has the room of a full
size SUV it is the best. The removable
seats comoe in very handy .. all the
seats come out easy just like the
Montana Minivan .. something no other
SUV can do... giving the Rendezvous the
most cargo space of any SUV.. the
interior design is great... the very
large center console holds a laptop and
a  lot of other things .. keeping the
cabin neat while charging the laptop
also. The fiberglass rear hatch is the
lightest one I've ever seen... and the
brakes are oversized and stop on a dime."

since it came on the market and decided 
to buy at the beginning of the model 
year.  I've customized my SUV with full 
wood interior trim which covers a less 
than lovely center console.  This car 
had everything I was looking for in an 
SUV, but particularly comfortable 
ride.  I'm beyond my sports car days, 
but think this SUV has a sporty 
appearance."

love the quietness, the luxury and 
sporty look. Not a rattle and it runs 
great. More than enough power for me.  
Check out a black two tone one, and 
the vehicle takes on different sporty 
look with the dark rear side 
windows.GM has worked out any bugs and 
has made a great car. Got over 
$5000.00 in rebates and invoice price. 
Payment is less than my three year old 
Honda van and alot more quiet. Drive 
this car , you will buy it. GM is back"

buick,rendezvous,2004,SlickRide25, 03/08/2004,Great Alternative to a minivan,5," Well we looked at a boat load of 
vehicles and had set our sights firmly 
on a minivan. I personally wanted to 
purchase a vehicle manufactured in the 
USA so we were considering the 
Chrysler Town and Country. The hole 
minivan thing just didn't sit well 
with me, so we started looking for 
practical alternatives. The Buick 
Rendezvous turned out to be a great 
fit for us. What a great stylish 
alternative to the minivan. We settled 
on the 7 passenger CX-Plus model. This 
vehicle has SUV style and appearance 
with all the comforts and practicality 
of a minivan. It rides exceptionaly 
well, and gets about 29 miles per 
gallon on the highway!"
buick,rendezvous,2004,Norman Landry, 03/09/2004,Rendezvous less than 1000 miles,4,"We purchased a buick because of 
ride,price, reputation of dealer and 
friendliness of sales person. We had 
also driven the following SUVs: 
Merceades; Vue;Lexus; Highlander; 
Murano;CUV and Element. Vehicle has 
less than 1000 miles- so far so good!"
buick,rendezvous,2004,JohnnyApel, 03/09/2004,G.M./Mexican Reject,1,"Worse GM Car I ever owned and I hear 
the same story from many other 
Rendezvous Owners. So, I guess it's 
just not me.Everything broke on it 
shortly after purchase. Permanent 
shimmy,( which service mgr.said was 
a ""normal shimmy"") wore out the front 
end in 10K so that it wouldnt pass 
state inspection. It was fixed under

buick,rendezvous,2004,Tim from WI, 03/12/2004,2004: New and Improved,4,"Just bought a new, Rendezvous CXL AWD 
with the 3.6L engine. Always 
wanted a vous but didn't 
like the anemic 3.4L. The new engine 
is GREAT and well worth the 
wait..plenty of power/torque!  The 
good news is that You don't have to 
buy the Ultra to get the larger 
engine.The larger engine is available 
on the CXL AWD for thousands less. For 
me, the CXL AWD is just as luxurious. 
The CXL shifts smoothly and has a 
quiet ride.  For those of you that 
have complained about the gauges, the 
new heads-up display clearly displays 
the speed, turn signals and the radio 
station so you can keep your eyes on 
the road without having to look too 
far away. "

buick,rendezvous,2004,Seafox, 03/19/2004,My Tiger Toy,4,"I have really enjoyed owning/driving
this vehicle.  At first I was concerned
that the engine was too small, but after
over a year of driving I have not
encountered a single instance when I
needed more power than it has.  It is
quite agile and maneuverable.  I have
plenty of room for all my needs  --  in
fact, I can get more into it than I
could in the Blazer it replaced.  It has
almost all the bells and whistles and I
enjoy every one."

26 mpg on trips. Transmission is about 
the poorest I have ever driven.  Slams 
at acceleration in traffic at about 4-
8mph.  Dealer tells me this is normal, 
so is my gas mileage.  Never again. I 
am going back to Ford next time Can't

I live in the midwest where we don't 
typically get too much snow, mostly

are a dime a dozen around here).  The 
Buick does not disappoint.  Handling

read the reviews here first before 
deciding, and found the reviews to all 
be correct.  My wife and I love it, the 
kids think it is cool.  It was great in 
the winter, felt sturdy and ""tank like"" 
in a good way.  My wife felt secure in 
it driving in snow and other bad 
weather, yet it is not too big that it 
is clumsy or hard to drive.  Turning

with cargo space and cheap looking

the Rendezvous figuring that it was out 
of our price range.  But, with 
discounts, we could get a nice base-
model Rendezvous with all of the

is just fine.  I get better gas

buick,rendezvous,2004,James F, 05/27/2004,buick rendezvous,4,"I have not bought a GM vehicle in the 
past 5 yrs. I was quite surprised when 
i test drove and bought a 2004 Buick 
rendezous CXL AWD. the overall package 
is a steal with the cash back that GM 
is offering right now. There is no 
other SUV on the market that even comes 
close to the value and carring capacity 
of the rendezous. Believe me i looked.
I am very impressed with GM's 
commitment to quality and raising the 
standard for all American made vehicles."
buick,rendezvous,2004,crrohlf, 05/28/2004,my view,4,"We've had a 2002 CXL and now have a 
2004.  It's been comfortable and 
relaible.  We like the 
appearance/functionality.  Guests like 
the back seat.  It's even better on the 
highway than I expected.  Well equipped 
and well built.  Even with AWD, it's 
not a vehicle you buy to go off-road."

thing.  The lift gate.  I have a 
DUrango and when I want to close the 
tailgate, I just barely push it down 
and its own weight will close it 
tight.  However, the Rendezvous has 
some kind of funky slow down and 
probably 8 out of 10 times I closed the 
tail gate, I had to reopen it and slam 
it closed.  Pain in the bum."

buick,rendezvous,2004,PaSteve , 07/11/2004,3.6 ltr AWD CXL,4,"Overall, we are very happy with the 
RDZ with the bigger engine (it is not 
an Ultra)providing strong 
acceleration and good gas mileage.  
Storage areas and interior 
space are excellent. Rear windows roll 
almost all the way down.  Only 
problem to date is a gas gauge (this 
is a problem on some of the 2004 
model, not earlier years).  Viewing 
while backing up is very difficult due 
to back pillar design and 
obstruction.  Handling could be 
tighter, but is good compared to 
minivans and truck-based SUVs. Leather 
interior is ok, but not upscale.  "
buick,rendezvous,2004,wiseone, 07/18/2004,"Nice Ride, but needs more power",4,"The car provides a very smooth ride, 
but needs more power, especially during 
initial acceleration when trying to 
merge into traffic that's moving faster 
(like freeway entrance ramps).  Would 
prefer if the rear captain's chairs 
didn't have a headrest as the headrest  
on the right passenger side entirely 
obstructs the driver's view and creates 
a dangerous blindspot.  Was also 
disappointed in the fuel economy.  The 
Rendezvous gets worse gas mileage than 
my Chevy Silverado V8. For the money, 
though, you get a lot of bells and 
whistles. "

buick,rendezvous,2004,longo, 08/04/2004,New Experience,2,"I've owned this 2004 Rendezvous for 2 
weeks now and I'm extremely 
disappointed. As a matter of fact For a 
car with a sticker price of $38,400 the 
car is horrible. The ride is noisy & 
sounds like you're sitting in a hollow 
drum. The fuel gage fluctuates 
dramatically, leaving you unsure of how 
much gas you have.I guess you have to 
be on flat ground to tell for sure) The 
power steering pump was defective from 
day one and has yet to be fixed. I've 
been told repeatedly that there is 
nothing wrong with the fuel gage. I 
would not recommend this car to anyone, 
it's not worth the money "

and have driven it on daily errands as 
well as long (4 hour +) drives and 
everyone driver and passengers are 
comfortable. Terrific pack out, love 
the optional third row seating (but 
this kills the pack out). Handles well 
and gets good mileage. Wife loves the 
rear assist feature that pings hen she 
is colse to an object behind her. 
Leather interior is holding up very 
well with two kids and a dog frequent

standard mini van."
buick,rendezvous,2004,contract employee, 08/19/2004,Love my new car,4,"I am a first-time SUV owner and love 
my Rendezvous.  I considered several 
cars and SUVs before selecting Buick, 
and I couldn't be happier.  It is very 
comfortable, provides a very smooth 
ride, looks great and it is everything 
I hoped an SUV would be.  I don't 
think I'll drive a car again.  I 
highly recommend the Buick Rendezvous."
buick,rendezvous,2004,E. Jaundice, 08/29/2004,Why I Choose The Rendezvous CXL,4,"My first priority was that the 
Rendezvous drives and handles like a 
car rather than a truck which other 
Suvs I tested did. It's design is 
unique and most attractive. You sit up
nice and high and your view of the road 
is perfect. The large side view mirrors 
give exceptional rear viewing although 
their size leave small blind spots 
looking forward."
buick,rendezvous,2004,andypapp, 09/01/2004,So Far So Good,4,"Purchased a CXL with the 3.6L engine. 
only two months old, but so far so 
good.  Have driven it around town, on 
long highway trips and up and down 
hilly areas.  Have none of the 
complaints about the undersized 
engine, well worth the added money.  
the ride is smooth and stable.  After 
the rebates its so cheap relative to 
the Acura and Lexus."

good comments from passerby . 7500 miles 
& no problems. A trip to Glacier & Banff was 
very comfortable. XM radio is great & Onstar 
reassuring. Although not a sportscar, it is a 
great blend of utility, ride & looks. Back-up 
alarm offsets problems backing up like my 
other SUV's."
buick,rendezvous,2004,Krissy L, 09/01/2004,Pleasantly Suprised,4,"Being that I'm only 24, and a little 
younger than the traditional Buick 
target, I didn't even consider the 
brand when looking for a new SUV.  
However, a salesperson managed to 
convince me to try it out, and I loved 
it from the minute I stepped foot into 
the vehicle!  It is comfortable, has 
tons of storage, has quite a smooth 
ride, and doesn't seem to guzzle gas as 
much as the other SUVs I've owned.  
Definitely a winner!"
buick,rendezvous,2004,Spendarella, 09/11/2004,Love my Rendezvous!,4,"I had the opportunity to drive a 
Rendezvous as a rental vehicle and fell 
in love with it.  The ride is more like 
a car than any other van or SUV I've 
owned/driven.  The interior was 
designed by women and its very roomy 
and comfortable.  The dealer was very 
fair and forthright and gave me an 
excellent trade in on my existing 
vehicle and a great price on the new 
Rendezvous.  We loved it so much, we 
went back the next week and traded our 
other vehicle and bought a second one!"
buick,rendezvous,2004,J.R. Kent, 09/21/2004,"Quiet, Solid, Spacious",4,"Our Rendezvous CX-Plus all-wheel-drive 
has very low levels of road and engine 
noise and is incredibly smooth -- a 
merciful reprieve from our noisy 2001 
Accord EX. Interior is well thought-out 
and a nice place to be. Seats are the 
most comfortable I've ever experienced 
over long distances. Interior is multi-
configurable, has lots of space and a 
flat floor. Handling is secure. 
Suspension damping could be about 5-
percent stiffer to cope with large road 
undulations at highway speeds. Gas 
mileage on a recent 900-mile road trip 
was 22 mpg at 75-to-80 mph with air 
conditioner running. "

ride is smooth and space is ample.  It 
has very clever use of storage space

adequate power and respectable fuel 
economy.  Entering and exiting the

with my daughter, in her Pontiac Aztec, 
made me realize that stepping up; with 
a ""grab handle""; then ""sliding out & 
down"", with a handle, was SO much 
easier on my knee.  I would recommend 
the Rendezvous for anyone who has had 
joint replacement! The trunk is easy to

still have room for shopping bags or 
soccer equipment.  I love the way that

I couldn't drive it home. A couple days 
after I got it I noticed it had a

PCV( related to computer system.)
They replaced that and I still had the 
same problem. At times I didn't know if 
it was going to start or not. Only had 
this SUV 2 months. I traded it on a 
Honda Accord. I just hope it's not a

The Rendezvous was on the back of the dealer's lot and was the internet special that weekend - I had never even heard of one, but now that I own one I see a lot of them on the highways around here. This car is a pleasure to drive - I bought the extended warranty because it had 99,000 miles on it at the time of the sale but we had no reason to utilize it.
This car is solid, better handling than anything I've had in the past."

We have replaced rear bearings, the power steering pump twice, and now the rear differential has went out. The seats do not fold completely down, so there goes the cargo space, and just look at those cloth seats and they stain!

The following are issues I have had to fix: Front tire hubs x6, wiring to traction control, wiring to steering wheel, wiring to heating and air conditioning control, tire bushings, back window washer arm, rear hatch handle x2, console cover, and most recently a transmission. Some of the issues were covered under the factory warranty but most were covered by the extended warranty at $200 each repair. When you buy a new car you don't expect issues such as these. If I had to do it all over again, I would have never bought this car.  I should have researched consumer reports first!"

I've had no real issues other then normal maintenance like new tires and oil and break changes. I bought another one a few years after and it was a used 2005. The couple we bought it from loved it and so do we! We have had maybe one issue with it but that has been in. The 2005 had all bells and whistles and we love it. I'd buy one again if they still made them. My teenage step daughter drove the 2004 for a couple years and it held up through all the teenagers being hauled around. She loved the vehicle and wanted her own when she moved out. I know people are talking about all these issues they have had but I can honestly say we own two and they still to this day drive great.

Cargo space is ample for the size of the vehicle.  Climate control system is easy to use and works well in all types of weather. Unfortunately Buick no longer makes this vehicle, but based on the great experience with this car, we have also purchased a Buick Enclave, which we feel is one of the best vehicles available today.

The AWD (versatrak) works Flawlessy. It always kicks in when I need it. Ice and Snow are no problem in fact I took a trip to minnesota to a ski resort. There was quite a bit of snow and ice. My daughter has a 2005 Honda CRV (She hates it.) and the real time 4wd could not handle the weather so my Rendezvous became the transport for 2 families.

The VVT 3.6 aluminum engine has plenty of torque (available at low revs) and gets you out of any highway situation immediately.  It provides smooth power that comes on without any jerking into a 'passing gear'.  About 7 times a year it is driven to a destination 5 hours away and because of comfort, I am able to drive back the same day!  Around town, I find myself driving easier and a bit slower, mainly because the experience is so enjoyable.

Then the AWD Disabled light came on-a differential valve had to be replaced for $480. Again no warranty.  I would never buy another GM vehicle and have owned many but this last vehicle has been a killer with repair costs on a GM certified car-ha ha.
buick,rendezvous,2005,Judi, 06/25/2007,Why did I buy this car?,2,"This is not a good SUV for a short person. The huge side mirrors block view from all angles. The overhead tailgate is unbelievably difficult to close. Tailgate interior strap broke last week, and tonight, the overhead interior glasses case clasp broke and is now hanging interfering with the rear view mirror.  The third row seats are extremely difficult to return to a sitting position. Overall, very poor interior design."
buick,rendezvous,2005,emj, 10/19/2007,"Overall, I'm satisfied with purchase",4,"The Rendezvous drives very nicely, and I find it very easy to manuver into parking spaces. The amount of cargo room is great. Also, the second row of seats fold forward to allow for extra cargo room if it's needed. I average about 18 mpg city and 22 mpg highway, so I guess the fuel economy is about average for this size SUV. The back end of the vehicle did start making a ""groaning"" noise a few months ago, which I was told by my mechanic was a problem with the rear differential fluid (I don't know if others have had this problem), so the fluid was refilled and the problem has not recurred so far.  I don't have any kids, but there's lots of room on board for all four of my dogs!  "
buick,rendezvous,2005,Denise, 09/27/2010,Loved mostly,4,"Before the grandchildren, this was a perfect vehicle for me, my adult children, and labs.  However, now there are two infants that need to have car seats rear-facing leaving no leg room for any other seat as it requires the seat in front of it to be shoved all the way forward. In all other regards, this has been a joy of a vehicle."
buick,rendezvous,2005,Dee, 06/20/2016,I would not wish this car on my worst enemy,1,"What a piece of garbage - bought with 50,000 miles, from original owner and he should be hung!!! this car has an issue that has required it to be in the shop on and off for the last 2 months.......no one can find the problem, I have just about replaced everything and the issue still remains...it will stall for no reason what so ever. Buick should be ashamed of themselves for selling this beast. I hate it.

buick,rendezvous,2005,another gm sucker, 02/06/2009,looks good doesn't work,3,"dont buy one.  trust me.  only 66k on mine and ive had everything fail.  Bearings, steering, premature brake failure, ABS, AWD system, and even the heater died.  Some was covered by warranty, other stuff I had to fight for under my extended warranty which they mysteriously lost"
buick,rendezvous,2005,kd, 10/17/2008,"Roomiest small SUV, luxury ride",4,"I've put about 45,000 miles on my Rendezvous and overall it has been a good vehicle. I avg. low 20's MPG which consists of about 50/50 city and highway miles. The upholstery could be better, very east to stain. One of the most comfortable riding cars I have owned and would beat any SUV for luxury ride.  The 3.4L engine is great around town, but lacks a bit of torque in the mountains - not a big deal though. The cargo space is amazing for a small SUV, probably nothting better in its class for a small, maneuverable SUV. I now have 80K miles and it still runs well and everything is intact.  No major work.  Overall, very pleased with ownership of this vehicle."
buick,rendezvous,2005,Greg, 08/28/2009,You Get What You Pay For,3,"I bought the Rendezvous for a traveling sales job in Canada.  There is very cold weather and some rough roads but mostly City and Highway.  The Highway drive is very smooth.  The interior seating space is excellent.  The price was good but I have encountered several annoying mechanical issues. I drove 100000 miles and have repaired (or should repair) the following  rear axle seals, rear bearings, brakes (twice), Power steering noise, hatch handle, 1 power window, 3 sensors which killed ABS and turned on eng fault  other issues severe buildup of snow and ice in wheelwells, floating gas gauge, worst factory stereo ever.  They coulda had a winner but they cheaped out in the build."
buick,rendezvous,2005,TD, 10/15/2009,never buy g.m. again,2,Some nice features to this car but far too many problems. Some minor things like interior flooding due too sunroof problems. Windows are scratched pretty deeply in some spots from going up and down. Big problem was rear differential needing to be replaced at a cost of $3000. Buick would offer no assistance or explanation for such a problem in a relatively new car.
buick,rendezvous,2005,mybuickrox, 01/06/2005,Rndezvous rox!,5,"Iam very impressed with the Buck Rndezvous vehicle.  Sfety features of anti-lock brakes, OnStar, and driver/passenger airbags are great.  Conveniences of keyless entry, delayed power for radio, and radio controls on steering wheel are a great benefit.  Overall I would recommend this SUV/crossover vehicle to anyone!"

Superior styling and performance makes me forget it's a cross over hybrid between a minivan and an SUV. I simply love it!
buick,rendezvous,2005,Dan Gannon, 02/15/2005,Nice Ride,4,"This car has a great ride and looks much smaller then it is. It gives much space but could use some extra, especially in the back for storage."
buick,rendezvous,2005,kbyers, 06/29/2005,Rendezvous,4,"i really like driving it. It is fun, comfortable, and really drives nice. My husband is very picky about his cars, and has always had me drive Chevrolets, especiallay Blazers. But he is sold on the Rendevouz. We do not like the interior. We wish cloth seats were more durable."
buick,rendezvous,2005,Jondaley, 07/25/2005,Pleasant surprise,4,"My wife likes this car so we got it.  I was not thrilled with it at first.  I like the ride and power train of the Chevy Equinox better, by my wife likes the comfort of the Buick.   It fits the kids and stuff well.  We took it on a short road trip, and I began to like it more and more.  It is a great highway car, stable and smooth.  Somewhat underpowered, but I can compensate for that.  Quiet and smooth.  No initial quality problems."
buick,rendezvous,2005,Dr. Rod, 08/17/2005,My Rendezvous 2004,4,Very good automobile.  My one big complaint is that the third seat is practically useless.  It can be used for small children but not an adult.  I have bucket seats so my 'R' will seat only four people.  I never thought GM would design a seat interior which is so confining.  Gas mileage is rated at 26 highway but I can consistently beat this by a couple of miles per gallon as I drive to conserve my car and gasoline.  Because of the seating I do not think I would buy this car again.  If anyone buys one they should look carefully at this.
buick,rendezvous,2005,Happy, 12/08/2005,Best car I've ever owned,5,"I almost bought another Honda CR-V but was shocked that the road noise was not any better than my current one.  I wasn't looking for it, it found me and I'm so glad it did.  This is the best car for the money I have ever seen and is very versatile.  I love the ride and power.  Me neighbor just retired as a  service writer at a Buick dealer and told me this vehicle only needs service - never repair."
buick,rendezvous,2005,Bill, 02/28/2006,Very Surprising!,5,"I've had my Rendevous for about a year now and I really can't believe the value! I never really even knew this SUV existed and boy am I happy I found it! It has so much more room than any other in it's class. Also, I was very concerned with the mileage and have been so surprised with the economy of this vehicle. I have friends with Jeeps and Toyotas who struggle with milieage and I have the bigger SUV and am consistently getting 22 around town and at least 26 on the HWY. It's all about how you drive it! Bottom line is they discount these vehicles big time because they can't compete with the imports, so for the money...there is no better deal going! There is so much room it's crazy! "
buick,rendezvous,2005,Doug Curtis, 05/07/2006,New - Used - Rendezvous,4,"My wife refused to drive a minivan and I did not want to pay for the gas of a traditional SUV.  That leaves a crossover.  We wanted to trade our Saab for either a Lexus, Acura, or BMW, but when we looked at the Rendezvous we were hooked.  We got a great deal on a year old GM exec CXL AWD with everything on it but the Nav and upgraded engine.  It rides better than all the other vehicles we drove, and talk about quite.  Only down side is the engine performance.  If you really want to get on it, the base engine won't cooperate, but it more than suffices for normal driving.  I am getting a combined 23-24 mpg on 87 gas.  No complaints there."
buick,rendezvous,2005,Loretta, 07/23/2006,Learn to love it,4,"I did not want this vehicle when we purchased it but, the more I drove it the more I loved it. It has plenty of space for the kids sports gear, the back seats recline to let the kids relax on a long trip, drink holders, storage space, lots of extras. It has turned out to be a great vehicle, and for the size the gas mileage is good. I get about 300 miles to a tank full. I reccomend it."
buick,rendezvous,2005,2005 rendezvous, 08/03/2006,My Rendezvous,5,"My mileage is averaging 24mph with the air on, (nice) tachometer approx 2000 rpm (65-70 mph) I enjoy the feel and safety if this car.

out.  It was perfedct from the day I 
got it. I get a lot of compliments

Like many others, the seat cloth stained very badly, rear hatch strap broke, sunglass compartment fell off. I'm now about to replace the rear differential for a 2nd time, the front end shimmies badly, and the air conditioning appears to be failing. The car has less than 50k on it. I have an extended warranty and these issues have all been addressed. BUT, it's a real pain dealing with these nuisances on a car that, at the outset, seemed so well-built. The gas mileage on the highway is actually pretty good but in town, watch out!"

buick,rendezvous,2005,ckinny, 07/14/2005,This car is junk,1,GM is clearly cutting corners.  The interior of the '05 compared to earlier models is subpar.  The fabric is cheaplooking and feeling.  The dash has been changed and not for the better.  Very hard and uncomfortabel to get to/sit in third row seat.  Gas mileage is a nightmare.

I call it the death trap because I will drive down the freeway anywhere from 30 to 70 miles and my car will shut off. No warning signs! The worst part is it stops like I have slammed the brakes, eveything in my car goes flying. So there my car will sit from 70mph to 0 mph in a matter of seconds. You can't steer it off the road, you just have to pray no one hits you. GM can not fix it, so I guess I have to wear my seatbelt, and I am thinking of getting a bumper sticker letting people know my car will stop instantly to prevent accidents. "

It not too small and not too large for city traffic. Also it's a very safe vehicle for our two grandkids to be in. That's another reason she got the Rendezous
buick,rendezvous,2005,Jeff, 01/13/2005,18 month owner,4,I enjoy the seating and the storage.  The mileage is adequate.  I have hauled wood on the top carrier several times.  It handles easily and has great visibility.

I put on a lot of miles and have traded each time because of GM's discount, rebates, GM credit card, and warranty. It does have some flaws, though. Wheel bearings will most certainly go (both ""02 and ""03) and the gasket around the driver's door was a problem (wind noise) on the ""03. Power steering gets sluggish in sub-zero temps and transmission is touchy in heavy traffic.  Many of the  options Buick offers were standard on the ""02 (Side air bags, ABS, monogrammed mats, cargo storage compartments on floor, etc..."

Of course, it was designed by a female engineer!"

All of my doors freeze when it is cold or windy. Took it to the dealer and there is no fix for it. I leased the car and had to put a remote starter in just to get in my car. Good luck, if you know of anything I could do let me know.  Warning ask about the freezing"
buick,rendezvous,2005,M K, 04/12/2005,Beautiful Buick Rendezvous,5,I used to own Ford Expeditions until I drove this Buick.  I Love it.  Rides as good as a Cadillac and gets good gas mileage.  Even my husband enjoys the ride and he is strictly a Cadillac man.

Plenty of storage space also for trips. Even my chihuahua loves to go for a ride in it. Great vehicle."

buick,rendezvous,2005,Michael Small, 05/27/2005,Satisfied customer,4,"This is my second vehicle and I am completely satisfied.  I wish they had put in a little larger engine, such as the 3.6 litre V6, which would have made it perfect.  It would also have increased the fuel economy. In the past three and one half years, I have only had one service call, and that was due to a short that occured after adding a trailer hitch."
buick,rendezvous,2005,jack, 06/25/2005,"Nice ride, easy entry",4,"We strongly recommend this vehicle for those who have relatives that have trouble getting into a car. This was the case with my inlaws, with my father-in-law having two hip replacements. The Buick's ride is very smooth. It feels much like a full size passenger car and the road noise is low."
buick,rendezvous,2005,Veronica, 06/29/2005,My Rendevouz,5,"I purchased a Rendevouz last summer and I abosolutely love it. Or course I purchased the top of the line. It has all the toys I could possibly ask for.  Yes, I like toys too, and I am a female. Compared to the Envoy that I originally wanted, the price was comparable. But this is great on gas! I rented a 2005 Pathfinder for 2 wks, due to autobody repairs on my vehicle.  The Pathfinder was a gas guzzler, although the pick up was better.  My three kids and I were very happy to have our Rendevouz back!  If you look at the pricing in the Rendevouz, it can go above the pricing of the Ranier.  It has a lot of perks that are out of the question in other cars due to the pricing."
buick,rendezvous,2005,Connie, 06/29/2005,Rendezvous,5,"My Rendezvous is a joy to drive and very comfortable.  I love the large side view mirrors. Mileage exceeds estimated numbers.  If anything, the back has more room than is convenient for me (I'm very short, can't reach things that slide forward.) I do have a problem with closing the back hatch. I have no desire to cross over, so that isn't an issue for me.  I wanted room and comfort.  "
buick,rendezvous,2005,Kathy, 07/09/2005,First SUV,4,"I have driven a Buick Riveria or LeSabre for the past 20 years, so am used to the luxurious ride.  My new Rendevous meets the challenge.

buick,rendezvous,2005,dave, 08/17/2005,Buick Ultra,4,"The 05 Ultra is comfortable and luxurious.  The HUD display is fun and funtional.  The 3.6 ltr. engine has lots of pep but less then advertised fuel economy, best we have seen out of this all wheel drive model is 21.  The vehicle is nimble but steering is somewhat choppy at higher speeds with the steering wheel pulling you one direction while you steer another.  Best described as a pulsing sensation.  The car rides great and has good visability.  Large mirrors compensate for a small blind spot on the driver's side.  The seats have excellent driving positions and the stereo is excellent. With the third seat installed your room sor storage is extremely limited.  Overall a stylish car."
buick,rendezvous,2005,Jim, 01/03/2006,Don't Believe EPA,3,"We are generally happy with the automobile and we are happy with the dealership.  However, we have been disappointed with the fuel efficiency of the car.  The estimated mileage for highway was 26 mpb, one of the principal reasons we purchased the car.  The best we can get at typical Interstate speeds is 20 mpg.  Dealer says that there is nothing they can do.  Very disappointing."

It is a very 'convenient' automobile, comfortable for 4-5 adult passengers and large storage capacity.  They have been very reliable for me, though I got better gasoline mileage with my first (AWD) one, averaging almost 21 mpg. This present one averages slightly under 20 mpg.  My biggest complaint with this one is the ride.  It seems to 'feel' every little bump and stone, more than I would expect with 17"" wheels.

buick,rendezvous,2005,joein508, 08/13/2004,Not many around,4,"Waited for the Ultra to get the bigger 
engine.  Good choice.  Runs well and 
handles well.  Can enter hywys with out 
fear.  Good turn radious. 
HUD should hold more info than just the 
speed. Radio? time? etc. Except for 
speed it just flashes the info for a 
short time.  
Radio is a problem.  Works ok on FM but 
picking up motor/electrical noise in 
AM.  Poor AM range and reception.  
Dealer blames antenna.  I blame 
installation.  Dealer going to install 
a new radio.  Time will tell who is 
right.

use it!Service dept.told me the motors

I have to suffer? For what the Buick

buick,rendezvous,2005,Tom Garove, 09/13/2004,My Third Rendezvous,4,"The 2005 Rendezvous Ultra is my third 
Rendezvous that I have owned and 
exceeds my expectations set by my 
previous Buick's. It provides all of 
the comfort needed for long road trips 
and the power I need to pass slower 
traffic during expressway driving . 
Buick put a lot of thought into 
improving the interior features of the 
2005 Ultra including the additional 
option of Captain's chairs which I 
ordered on my vehicle. 
The added power of the new v-6 engine 
has provided me with the extra pwoer I 
felt I was missing in my earlier 
vehicles while not significantly 
sacrificing gas mileage. "

I have LOVED the Rendezveous! 
NOW --well you judge....7 months/8 
major problems
1) Just under 45,000 miles we had to 
replace the front Wheel Bearings - 
2) and consequently all the tires.
3) The Transmission went - MAJOR bits 
and pieces in the oil pan
4) the clutch was replaced
5) the clutch was replaced AGAIN
6) the air conditioning went-something 
about a cracked block
7) The gas gage no longer works
8) After noting a strange noise when 
turning a tight circle we have now been 
told the Rear Wheel Differential needs 
to be replaced for $4000 -- if not 
repaired we have been told that the 
rear wheels ""could"" lock"

Reneavous. Great gas mileage.

highway with lots of great gimmicks GPS,
XM Satellite, On-Star in an SUV that is
getting a real 27 per gallon on cruise
control interstate driving.  Hope next
year is as satisfying as the first. 
Still wish Buick had stood up to GM and
put the 3.8 V6 in it instead of the sad
little 3.4 from Pontiac.  Had four 3.8's
and they all ahve gone 250,000 for fun
without even pushing oil.  Ohn Well!"

a fine quality, I don't think they 
should have given it a poor quality 
rating. I like my vehicle and would 
consider buying another one.  When 
people ask me about my vehicle I highly 
recommend them to buy one.  I do wish 
it had more leg room in the second and 
third row.  I also would like if it had 
better gas mileage.  Also, if the On 
Star had a phone you could take out of 
your car so you wouldn't have to have a 
cell phone with one number and your On 
Star with another number. "

with the CXL Model.
I believe some of your ratings on some 
Models does not jive with the real 
performance of these vehicles.
We do not find the interior of the 
Rendezvous that cheap, did you ever try 
to maintain the wood paneling on a 
Beamer or Mercedes, it can be a 
nightmare. And if you have it all 
scratched up or damaged by any other 
way, it's ugly.So, I like the plain 
gray interior which willtake a few Kids 
and a DOg in good stride."
buick,rendezvous,2005,Ray Walters, 12/20/2004,Fantastic car,4,"I have purchased many new cars but have 
never been so totally satisfied with 
any car as I have with this Rendezvous. 
Of course we would always want better 
mileage but, other than that, this car 
is a ten all the way. The Navigation 
system, On Star, built in cell phone, 
heads up display, back-up sensor, 
foldup seats, etc - all make this car 
of the future here today."

family car and after test driving a 
variety of other SUVs we found the 
Rendezvous to be the best value. It was 
not only much more comfortable than any 
other SUV we test drove, but had a lot 
more cargo room and passenger room. We 
had a wonderful experience at the 
dealership purchasing our Rendezvous 
and couldn't be happier with our choice!"
buick,rendezvous,2005,sam0616, 01/01/2005,Best car I have ever owned,4,"This is by far the best care/SUV I have 
ever owned. I have previously owned a 
Dodge Shadow, Subaru Imprezza, Infiniti 
G20 and Nissan Maxima. I traded the 
maxima in for this. I have never before 
felt like driving everywhere as I do 
with this car. It gives me the security 
and safety of driving an SUV and the 
smoothness and stability of driving a 
car. I love the roominess without the 
bulky look of a truck or corny look of 
a minivan. The gas mileage is just as 
good, if not slighly better, than my 
Maxima, which is very impressive. 
Overall, I think this is a best bet for 
someone looking for the feel of a 
minivan, ride of a car and look of an 
SUV. "
buick,rendezvous,2005,2003 Buick Rendezvou, 01/05/2005,A good car for the money,4,"We are happy with the vehicle. The 
selling point was the captians chairs

Very roomy, easy to drive. Main problem

time.  It is pleasant to drive, and very 
comfortable.  The radio works well, as 
do the power windows seat and other 
amenities.  Not purchased for going off 
road.  I do not desire an off road 
vehicle, I already have one.  This is a 
very nice family vehicle.  It was 
reported that the standard V6 does not 
have adequate power. I have been out on 
the interstate with this one and it 
runs fine, it's not a race car but 
that's not what I purchased.  If I 
wanted a sports car I would buy one."

car I have ever purchased. I bought ALL 
of the options: Navigation, heads up 
display, satellite radio and, of 
course, back up warning, onstar with 
built in cell phone - everyday learning 
more neat things about these features. 
I have owned many vans but this is the 
first one that rode like a luxury sedan."

buick,rendezvous,2005,Richard Outcault, 01/27/2005,2005 Buick Rendezvous,4,"As a sportman, the car provides an easy 
way to travel to golf courses and 
beaches. The driver's area has a 
convenient console for traveling, 
everything is accessible.  Cup holders, 
storage box and storage under the 
console can not be duplicated in other 
SUV's.
This is my second Rendezvous and to 
date neither has let me down 
performance-wise.  The engine and drive 
train are reliable.  First time I've 
had all wheel drive and I'm a little 
disappointed with the gas mileage.
The all leather seats are proving more 
comfortable than the seats on my 2002 
Rendezvous.  I like the improved 
styling.  Negative is the removal from 
the 2005 of the 2002 two storage bins 
on the side panels of the third seat."
buick,rendezvous,2005,Bob Corwin, 02/22/2005,Great Automobile,4,"This is my 2nd Rendezvous, the 1st was a 2002 CX.  I was so pleased with my first Rendezvous and its dependability that I purchased the 2nd with most of the 'bells and whistles"". So far I have not been disappointed. I find the styling, features and construction to be top-notch.  As for the most often complaint as to its underpowered engine, I have found no trouble in passing any car when I wish and this auto's hill climbing abililty on the highway is unsurpassed. Unless you have a lead foot and are looking for a race car I think you'll find its power more than adequate and you will get decent gas milage as a bonus. Take one for a test drive and I don't think you'll be disappointed."
buick,rendezvous,2005,Carol Grider, 03/11/2005,Review of my Rendezvous,5,"My past two vehicles were a Ford Explorer, then a Ford Expedition.  I loved both, but when the family got smaller I didn't need all the room of an Expedition, so we looked for a comparable vehicle as far as looks and comfort.  We tried the Rendezvous and fell in love.  I have had it almost a month now and love how it drives, handles and the smooth ride.  We got all the bells and whistles and we can't say anything bad about it.  I LOVE IT!!  Thanks GM for a great product. "
buick,rendezvous,2005,Rich Mayer, 03/13/2005,2005 CX Rendezvous,5,"The 2005 CX base model  Rendezvous has been an outstanding experience for me !! Smooth, quiet ride.  Better gas mileage than many smaller vehicles. Gorgeous exterior -- especially from the front. My favorite thing is the way the dashboard lights up at night. The light-silver dials turn to black. All numbers and pointers light up in a green/blue teal. And there is a slight angelic white glow emminating from behind the anchor spot of the needles."
buick,rendezvous,2005,VeryDisappointed, 03/18/2005,Be cautious,3,"Gas mileage is WAY below rating. Sticker was 18-28 and actual highway is under 18. Not even close. I hate to think what around town driving will be.Dealer/GM says thats the best that can be expected, despite sticker rating. Electronic features have been a constant source of aggravation and repair- Navigation system, radio,climate control, mirrors,horn, etc. Very quirky and inconsistent. Never sure if they are going to work. Dealer has been very helpful, but it's hard to reproduce (and fix)intermittent problems. VERY frustrating."
buick,rendezvous,2005,Auntie, 03/19/2005,2005 Rendezvous a great vehicle,4,"Very reliable vehicle,excellent and ample carrying space. This is the second model Rendezvous that I have owned, handles road well, excellent control in snow."

buick,rendezvous,2005,Andrita Durbin, 05/25/2005,I love this vehicle,4,"I just completed a 2500 mile trip and have no complaints other than not being able to use the CD player when using the navigation system. The ride was very comfortable, drive was as in a luxury car. Was in a lot of rain and had no problems with traction. Find driving speed has a lot to do with gas milage, when kept the speed down the milage went up. Love the speed reflection on the windshield, never have to look at the speedometer, so don't take eyes off of the road as much. Sets higher than a car so visabilty is execlent, seat sets high enough above floorboard so body alignment is good, less strain on hips. Drove through several mountain ranges and still averaged 20 MPG."

I didn't want to buy a minivan so we purchased the Buick.  It's nice, but rides like my grandma's car.  I wish the ride was firmer and sportier. I went with a Buick because I wanted to buy American. I hope the next time around, if I go with Buick, I will be less disappointed with my decision.  On the plus side, it parks just about anywhere and has a nice ride.  Also, get the 7 seat option.  Without the 3rd row, I'm not sure it's worth the money.  On the downside, it's a gas hog.  You'd think GM would see the big picture and put more hybrids and efficient rides on the market..."
buick,rendezvous,2005,Steve, 07/13/2005,Love My Buick,4,"The only problem with my car was squeaking brakes, and GM had a fix for it at no charge. The dealer has been excellent and the AWD works very well in NH winters. It handles well on the highway, and gas mileage is decent. I get many positive comments about the style."
buick,rendezvous,2005,Cincy, 07/16/2005,Buick Rendezvous,4,"I love my Rendezvous.  It's perfect for daily travel, with a very comfortable ride and great visibility.  I love having the 3rd row seats that can hold 7 passengers or for extra storage.   Unfortunately, when the 3rd row seats are up, there's very little storage but for an umbrella stroller.   I'm averaging about 17-20mpg Hwy, and that's with construction and stop and go traffic.  It's better on longer stretches on the highway.  It's a great vehicle for a small family with all the extras and not the huge price tag."
buick,rendezvous,2005,tablescape, 08/08/2005,Enjoying my new Rendezvous,4,I am very happy with my new utlra Rendezvous. I am glad I have the bigger engine and the heads up display. I was surprised by how much I like the extras like the heads up and XM radio. The radio controls on the steering wheel and the display of the station on the windshield let me change the stations and keep my eyes on the road. My daughter loves the back seat radio with headsets. The mirrors are big and were a little hard to get used to but they are very helpful especially how they tilt down for parking. I am very careful in drivethru windows. 
buick,rendezvous,2005,jimbo, 11/10/2005,One of the best I've owned,4,"I have owned many GM vehicles, and have found this to be the most comfortable and trouble free of them all. I was in a van last car, and decided to downsize. I love this size as I have room for anything I want to haul, but small enough to feel like I'm not in too big a vehicle. I got the 3.6 V6 and find it to be quiet and responsive, but can't get the mileage over 19 mpg on the highway. I also find the liftgate to be heavy, and will get the automatic one next time."
buick,rendezvous,2005,Stan Berg, 01/17/2006,Proud Owner,4,This is my first SUV and I am very pleased with it. Gas mileage was better than I thought it would be. The exterior appearance is great. I have received many compliments on the appearance. I have had zero problems with it. The vehicle handles great and drivers perspective is one of a feeling of good control. The interior is a little on the plain side but then I also purchased the no frills version. 
buick,rendezvous,2005,Marcia L, 05/15/2006,We Love It!,4,We love our Rendezvous.  This was my first American vehicle and so far so good.  We've owned it 10 months now.    The ride is smooth and comfortable.  Gas mileage is exactly as advertised on the sticker (19 city/26 hwy).  It's roomy and comfortable on longer trips.  Lots of storage space.  
buick,rendezvous,2005,none, 11/20/2006,Awesome Car,4,"We bought this Rendezvous because of the price, and the fact that this is not our first Buick.  The Rendezvous has many features with the CX base. The ride is very comfortable with a lot of leg room. There is also a lot of cargo room. You can fit many boxes in the car if you are moving. There isn't that much wind noise in the car even if you drive fast. The car also is high in the back and lower in the front to prevent the car from tipping over. The gas mileage is great. We drove from Connecticut to Maine and it took about 1 full tank of gas."
buick,rendezvous,2005,James Charnock, 11/28/2006,Some Disappointments,3,"Worst thing about the SUV are headrests: 6"" back from one's head.  For safety it should be 2"" or less.  I had to add neck pillows to compensate.  Gas mileage closer to 15 than 19 for city.  No vinyl protection available for top of back bumper so the bumpers are too subject to dings by others.  Cross bars not very strong and no vinyl stripes on roof top to keep cargo bag from scratching surface.  Like the wideness and shortness of the vehicle (for short garages)--4x8 sheets fit in without riding on the wheel wells--good handyman vehicle, especially with removable 2nd seats.  Pulldown hatch strap has broken twice in one year. Poorly designed.  Seat and height comfortable. Very hot days tax AC. Very cold tax heater"
buick,rendezvous,2005,Alfred, 02/10/2007,Luxury SUV at 1/2 the price,4,I never thought I would buy an American car until I saw the great quality ratings and how little this cost compared to a comparable RX330 or Acura MDX. This was a steal for the same quality and comfort!
buick,rendezvous,2005,jfm, 02/06/2007,Just what we needed!,4,This vehicle has the people and cargo carrying capacity we searched for in a mid-size SUV that could get good gas mileage (first tank I got 28 mpg)! It is comfortable and quiet to drive.  2nd seat passengers like the ride and the rear AC flow.   
buick,rendezvous,2005,Sharon , 09/22/2007,Tear in my Beer,5,This was my  first SUV purchase and I was very happy  The ride is smooth and  enjoyable to drive. The vehicle is large and adequate to fit our family of six our dog.
buick,rendezvous,2005,2005 rendezvous cx, 09/03/2007,Thought Rendezvous was a great deal,2,"Now there is a unusual sound that comes from the engine and the car shakes if  we drive over 75mph. This vehicle is now we realize made for the first time in 2002, it doesnt have a long history of good record like lasting long. We still own a '96 regal and a '01 century and both of them drive superb. We heard great things about the Rendezvous from friends but they already returned theirs because he was on a lease. The sound for the bass in the newer Buicks are horrible, which includes the '05 Rendezvous. Seems like a great car in the beginning but not really good."
buick,rendezvous,2005,Trace, 03/08/2008,Thank you Buick!,4,"I bought this CSUV a couple of years ago and have loved it ever since. At first the exterior ""look"" was a little iffy since I am an active single mother or only one. But when my son and I went out camping, fishing, and using the vehicle as an overall Road Trip/Outdoor Enthusiast mode for transportation, we fell in love even more! My son has back surgery every 6 months and the Rendezvous has by far been the most comfortable ride he has had since his accident! We would highly recommend a Rendezvous to anyone! They are great and with rising gas prices, we cant complain about the 25 Mpg we recieve when road tripping for all the ammenities and versatility we have with it! Thank you Buick!"
buick,rendezvous,2005,Sunni, 03/21/2008,2 years and loving it,4,I have had this Ultra for 2 years and have been very satisfied with it's comfort and quietness as well as the total ease of driving. It is very smooth to handle and of course it rides like a Buick. With the larger V6 engine it has plenty of get up and go and the interior was well designed with plenty of cubby spaces and cup holders. The heads up display keeps your eyes on the road and the radio controls on the steering wheel keep your hands on the wheel. If you need a good vehicle to keep your family safe and comfortable and you are sick of mini-vans this is your ride.
buick,rendezvous,2005,bri, 04/01/2008,It does the job - so far,3,"We bought ours from private seller used. Basic model with one or two upgrades for 12,000 with only 20500 miles on it. Would not have paid the advertised 15000 from a dealership for similar Rendezvous. Rides like a truck and uses the gas. I have only had this suv for a little more than a month with no major complaints. If any major complaints come along I will do another review "
buick,rendezvous,2005,Tracy G, 04/03/2008,Happy Change,4,"This was my second car! I drove a 2000 Ford Focus that got great mileage and never had any problems until one day it just died at 165,000 miles. My husband and I wanted a car that would last and be great for when we have kids. I outright refused to get a minivan. This car was perfect. I drive 60 miles a day on the highway and have no problems. The gas mileage is pretty good for an ""suv."" (I get 28/mpg) I run a small catering company and the cargo space is great. I love the deep center console that locks. And the several other compartments, as well as the multiple plug in areas for phones etc. There is also plenty of room if my friends and I decide to car pool. Excellent value for the price. "
buick,rendezvous,2006,Ronald Coleman, 02/17/2016,What a Car.,5,"I have been told that Buick makes a great vehicle.  This Rendezvous lives up to Buick's reputation.  I couldn't be more pleased with this Rendezvous.  Gas mileage is average for a crossover.  With Onstar and XM radio plus all the other features, I find myself smiling.  The SUV is quiet on the road; however, on side roads and in the city it does not take bumps on the road well.  Overall, for what I spent, this SUV's owner is one happy camper.  : )

buick,rendezvous,2006,Eva Stone, 03/06/2015,A Love Hate Relationship,2,"Bought this 06 in 2010 with 37,000 miles.  Great handling and very comfortable car with lots of cargo for hauling my music gear.  Then it left me stranded with a radiator problem at about 85,000 miles.  Trial and error to fix that left me stranded several times.  Kind of been down hill from there. Chrome fell off the wheels, had to replace those. Have LOTS of problems with the front end, wheel bearings and such.  This winter got extremely cold and the fuel sensor went out, left me traveling with a maximum speed of 30 MPH several times till we replaced that. I'm at 137,000 and the front axes is grinding and will need to be replaced.  I think it's time to replace the car.  "
buick,rendezvous,2006,sam, 11/29/2015,Great ride for 9 years!,5,"We were not looking for bells and whistles.
No major repairs. Many good trips.
Very good head and leg room for tall occupants.
"
buick,rendezvous,2006,DCSFORUM, 04/24/2010,Very Nice Vehicle,4,"Bought this vehicle through a private sale with 45,000 miles and still under warranty.  Researched a lot of vehicles before deciding that we wanted a Rendezvous because it is a great combination of flexible utility and roominess, fuel economy, comfort and quality.  This is the quietest vehicle I've ever owned.  Like the 3.5L engine a lot - smooth, quiet, and plenty of power.  I have gotten over 30 mpg if I keep my foot out of it.  Has a high-quality feel to it.  Has a good amount of room inside for the fuel mileage.  Larger utility vehicles like the Trailblazer get much worse mileage.   I think they had the bugs worked out of these for 2006/2007 model years.  Really a nice family vehicle."
buick,rendezvous,2006,1stmeridian, 09/04/2014,Full of issues-American made POS,2,"It's really too bad we have to take so many shortcuts in the USA with cars. I have had more problems with US made vehicles than any foreign vehicle I've owned. 
This car has multiple major issues:
Power windows fail, often due to wiring shorts and breakage.
Lighter/phone charger fails also due to faulty wiring.
Rear driver side door no longer locks. Nothing electrical works in that door.
Fuel indicator failure and the part is in the tank so extremely difficult and expensive to fix.
Tachometer intermittent failure.
All gauges in the dash have issues.

The upgrades of the interior on the CXL that really sold us are the sunroof and the ""bun"" warmers.  We are both tall (over 6'2"") and the headroom and legroom are amazing for both the front and 2nd row!"

It is very quiet, smooth, has reasonable power, and has reasonable gas mileage. It is flawless with its fit and finish, and its quality of components is also very good. "

Problems, AWD failed in the winter (short in the wiring) failed rear hatch touchpad, leaking transfer case and unreliable fuel gauge. Had to replace table bushings, tie rods, knuckle bushings and both front and rear brakes before reaching 40k. Thank God for the 48 month warranty. I am 54 and do not drive hard or abuse my vehicles. I own a 03 buick century that the wife drives and only had to change the front brakes once in 6 years.  Rendezvous quality control stinks and I now understand why they do not make them anymore. When my lease expires in May, it is gone!!"
buick,rendezvous,2006,PhillyGirl, 08/06/2010,Nice feel but lots of repairs,3,"We loved our Buick at first.  Within 3 days of purchase our windshield wipers stopped working in a snow storm because the motor on wiper blew?  We had to get a new transmission 3 years into the car and was asked to pay $6,000.  The warranty had expired.  I never ever had to pay for a new transmission in a 3+year car.  "
buick,rendezvous,2006,duke28, 11/29/2006,Buick Rendezvous,4,"I love the visibility from both sides and behind in this vehicle.  The doors open wide enough for a handicap person.  It's a comfortable car and easy to handle.  We live in the mts and have no trouble getting around, we have front wheel drive.  However, my gas mileagel isn't always the best in the mts. but I will not complain......."
buick,rendezvous,2006,Frances G, 11/03/2015,Worst car ever,1,"This is by far the worst investment I have ever made. It is one thing after another with this car. Once you fix one problem another arises. To start with it was a speed sensor(wheel bearing) then is was the oil sensor. Then it got to the point where EVERY TIME I fuel up the car would not want to start again. I would literally have to wait 2-3 minutes and still press the gas before it would start again (how embarrassing) very inconvenient. And to top it off last night the battery light came on. I know what you r thinking ""simple fix"" turns out no. I will have to put it I The garage to find out if it is a problem with the computer, transmission, or the engine. I have had it with this car. I will NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER BUICK EVER!!! All of these problems I am having seem to be common problems if you check other reviews; however, there have been no recalls or even attempt to fix these problems. I am done with this vehicle. I also now have a light that says reduced engine power and it will not go more than 30mph.

Though totaled out, frame absorbed entire impact and vehicle crumpled in right places to absorbe roll-over. We have a duplicate on hold pending insurance payout. Like previous comments, it may start out as wife's car, but it will grow on you. "

We like to travel in the Buick and find the ease of driving a real plus.  Access to controls, reaction of the car to my comands and fuel economy is great.  We average 25 on the road and 19-20 in town.   Recommend this car to you.  The only problem has been that my wife likes the 2007 evan better!!"

We get about 25 MPH on the road and 19Mph in city driving. The car has more storage room than my 2007 GMC Envoy. The residuals have come down dramatically and we can now buy it at a resonable price. My wife is estatic."
buick,rendezvous,2006,emmygirl, 03/22/2013,Had to trade Ol' Bessie in...,3,"I wanted so badly for the SUV to perform up to my expectations, and it did... for a while.
Bought my 2006 in 2008 with 48k miles on it.
High, but I got a great deal.
The ride was always smooth and quiet, styling was great in the front and inside- the hatchback styled rear is terrible, and the split panelling on some models- ugh! Horrendous. Sadly over 4 years the wiring went out underneath the car which made it stop... mid drive.
I replaced the radiator, there were yearly replacements to a wheel bearing, and my fuel level indicator crapped out so I regularly ran out of gas.
Finally the A/C drain hose pretty much ruined my interior with mold and I finally had to trade it in."
buick,rendezvous,2006,DAN HERMAN, 06/05/2006,New Buick,5,Thi is our first Buick.  It is a lot roomier and better riding than we expected. It is quiet and gets very good gas mileage for an SUV.
buick,rendezvous,2006,Al Hummels, 11/26/2006,Great Vehicle,5,"We traded in our like new Surburban for this vehicle and took it on a 1 week 3,000 mile trip. I can't believe how comfortable and easy to drive it is. I am 6'4"" and weigh 275 lbs and have plenty of room.  My wife is disabled (couldn't get into the Surburban) and finds it easy to get into and out of.  We love it and would recommend it to anyone."

It did happen to visit mechanic, but which car didn't?
regularly change brakes, oil, and fluids, etc.
there is no major issue. however, the interior is not meeting my exception of the luxury SUV. "
buick,rendezvous,2006,Paul Cesarini, 10/16/2006,Best vehicle we've bought in years,4,"We opted for a fully loaded CXL model (though without the XM radio or heads-up display, since our daily commutes are only a few miles).  For us, it's the ideal blend of a roomy, family-friendly vehicle with all the benefits of an SUV and a minivan, but virtually none of the drawbacks.  Unline the Highlander and competing vehicles, the Rendezvous has a third row seat capable of comfortably holding two adults.  I've even sat back there, myself.  The leather and wood grain interior is worth the extra cost.  We got all the safety features, though we skipped the AWD.  FWD + traction control + ABS is fine. We previously had a Saturn VUE, but I'm glad we traded it for the Rendezvous"
buick,rendezvous,2006,Rick Z, 12/24/2006,2006 Rendevous,4,We have a CXL loaded including the trailer package and 3.5 V-6. We traded our 2003 Escalade to take advantage of the advertised highway 28 mpg. The 17 in town and 21 on the road is a dissapointment. The comfort is good

buick,rendezvous,2006,Scammed in Miami, 07/25/2017,TAKEN by the LOOK,3,"I bought a 2006 a few months ago with approximately 138000 miles on it.  I loved the look of the SUV and the visibility was great Unfortunately for me I bought a lemon.  The first thing was the rack and pinion $250, then steering column $500, then EVAP system $400 now the throttle body and temperature hoses $475.  Also the transmission gasket is leaking don't have a price for that yet.   The SUV is taking up a lot of anti-freeze which I am told may require a intake valve manifold seal replacement no price for that either. Had to put 4 new tires $300, brakes $135 and ailment $75 which I expect as maintenance.   The repairs have cost more than the total price of the car which was $1350.  The retail price for the car currently in good condition to sell will only be $2100 If i can sell it for that.  I will be out the amount I paid for the car.

buick,rendezvous,2006,Guy, 06/04/2006,I can't believe GM built this,5,"We have had Mercedes, BMW's and Lexus.  Most recent a Lexus RX330.  The Buick is every bit as good and is more comfortable.  We needed more room and didn't want to give up MPG.  Guess what? The Rendezvous is bigger and gets better MPG. 15% better.  We stopped by the dealer just to take a look and were sold and bought it that day.  Sold by the vehicle, not the salesman who was very low pressure.  Buick should do a better job of getting the word out on this one."
buick,rendezvous,2006,Andrews T, 08/28/2006,Pleasant surprise,5,"This vehicle has been a pleasant surprise.  After 14k and two trips of at least 500 miles each way, I've been impressed with comfort, mileage (26+ W/ 87 Octane).  Around town driving is 23+ w/ 87 octane.  Storage space is great and the seating options provide a family w/ a 2 year old  latch options for car seats in both 2nd and 3rd rows.  Went w/ base model as it provided best value for money.  Have had no major issues.  Tire pressure monitor gave false reading (reset myself aftering checking) and oxygen sensor was replaced under warranty.  Excellent experience. Surprised by quality and behavior of vehicle under load and spirited driving.  "
buick,rendezvous,2006,Paul Camern, 04/08/2009,A Great Vehicle!,4,"Leased my Rendezvous brand new in 2006 and bought out lease in 2009 because I have never owned a more reliable and dependable vehicle than this. Buick hit it out of the park with the 2006 model yr. and wish they were still being built since the Enclave is too big and much more expensive than the Rendezvous. For an Suv it handles very well, it's a Buick so it is very well appointed. Gas MPG is remarkable getting 20 mpg in town and 27 mpg on the hwy. Other than oil changes and the 30,000 mile maintenance, I have not spent one cent on my Rendezvous!"
buick,rendezvous,2006,Jeannie, 04/27/2010,Awful Car!!!,2,"I purchased my '06 Rendezvous in early '07.  I have had nothing but problems.  I was in the market to find an SUV/crossover with better gas mileage.  All I got were repair bills!  Everything from brakes, rotors, oxygen sensors, wheel bearings, anti-lock brakes & the AWD have needed repairs.  The cost of this vehicle is amazingly high!  I would NEVER recommend this vehicle to anyone!"
buick,rendezvous,2006,paul cameron, 10/30/2008,I Really Like This Buick,4,"I have owned this Rendezvous for 3 yrs. It is an excellent vehicle. Even 3 yrs old there are no rattles or decline of quality. Have not had 1 single mechanical problem of any kind. Totally dependable. With 3rd row seating down can fit 4 suitcases and 4 sets of golf clubs in the Rendezvous for a golf trip. Perfect! Gets 26 mpg on the hwy. Being a Minnesota vehicle I use both air and heater and the heating/cooling systems work perfectly,quietly and quickly."
buick,rendezvous,2006,Robin Koykka, 09/07/2009,2nd Rendezvous,4,"We really enjoyed our 2002 Rendezvous, owned an HHR and Escape since, and we find ourselves in a Rendezvous again. We love the versatility, the quiet, and the third row. We test drove the new Enclave, but found it hard to justify the price when this CXL has everything including heads up display (HUD). We have done a six week (16,000 km) road trip with the Rendezvous, and it was great. It handled all the terrain with ease. We did the complete Route 66, then West coast, Vancouver, the Rockies, Montana, Yellow Stone, the Black Hills, and headed back East to Midland Ontario all without a hitch. I recommend the Rendezvous CXL to anyone looking for a comfortable, and versatile people hauler."

The radio system is great. The ride smooth. Whoever rides with me on long trips also comments how great a ride it gives. Bad weather no problem. It just goes right thru it. Anyway in 3 more years I will be leasing another one. "

Fuel economy is very good for this type vehicle.There is plenty of room for passengers and luggage and whatever else one needs for trips. Car can be driven for long periods without driver fatigue. I have the CXL option and this gives me everything I need in the vehicle. The visibility out of the car is also very good. The car is also easy to drive and park in the city. The vehicle is very quiet and this makes conversation easy and pleasant. We looked at vans, sedans, and Suv's and found the Buick Rendevous to blend the best of each of these vehicles into one vehicle."

We got a great deal on it because it was a former rental with 9340 miles on it.  It has everything - leather interior, faux wood grain dash, rear parking assist, power everything, third row seating, satellite radio, OnStar, automatic climate control, etc.  This is the most comfortable car I've ever owned and also the nicest.  I considered a Toyota Highlander, Chevrolet Equinox, Pontiac Torrent and Kia Sorrento.  After test driving them all I knew the moment I sat down in the car that it was the one for me.  As far as longevity goes, we'll see.  But, I'm am very happy with my purchase and the dealer I went to."
buick,rendezvous,2006,Richard, 01/23/2007,A Great Car,4,"I'm on my second Rendezvous and will probably buy a third. I need a 7-seater and I don't like big boats (Suburban, etc.). I was looking for a smallish city car that can seat my whole family, and this is it. The price is about the lowest in class, the quality is good. And it's small, which I love. I think only the Hyundai Santa Fe is smaller or cheaper, and I'd never buy a Hyundai. It looks stylish on the outside, plenty of space and flexibility inside.  It's not overdesigned. Just a good car. It's interesting to me that the customers rating for this car was so much higher than the editors rating. Maybe the editors need to drive it again.  "
buick,rendezvous,2006,Brian, 03/01/2007,2006 Rendezvous,4,"Very nice vehicle! I traded in a Chevy Trailblazer for the Buick to improve fuel economy and have been pleasantly suprised on how much cargo space this vehicle has! The vehicle has great power around town and the high seating position offers great visability for driving. The fit and finish on the vehicle is very good but I am very disappointed about the lack of space for tall drivers. I am 6'4 and although there is sufficient headroom, the legroom is much less than the Trailblazer and the driver's side door sticks to far in and hits my left leg. I also hit the parking brake with my leg as I enter and exit the vehicle. What I would give for a split bench seat!"
buick,rendezvous,2006,Sam, 12/09/2008,Great SUV,5,"I have been really happy with this car. It gets around 23-25 mpg on the highway at speeds of 70-80 mph. The around town mileage has been 21.5 mpg. It rides great and the seats are really nice. It is a CXL with sunroof and every other option minus DVD and navigation but the Garmin nuvi 550 takes care of that.  I've just travelled 7,000 miles in the last 3 months across the country, no problems at all.  I highly recommend this car."

I've had so many compliments on this car.  I've bragged about how fantastic it is. With the fold up seats I can use it in so many ways. The mileage is around 25mpg. Even with the 3.5 engine I've all the power I want or need. It is extremely driver friendly. I tried the Chevy Equniox but it wasn't driver friendly at all. All in all, all I can say is I have what I always wanted. A wonderfully smooth ride, good mileage, everything easily accesible, but most of all is the compliments I get from everyone who sees it then after they ride in it, they want to go for another ride.

buick,rendezvous,2006,Sam Keifer, 08/03/2008,Great Car,5,"I test drove a number of vehicles and liked the way the Rendevous felt on the road.  I have been happy with the fuel economy.  21.5 average and 25.5 on the highway at 70 MPH.  Overall, it is a great car. The editors and other people don't rate it like the owners...but drive it you'll like it and you'll like the price of insurance and the price of the vehicle.  "

I'm a 43 year old single dad and like to think I'm still a little cool. However after driving it, I was sold! Handles well, good pick up, loaded with interior compartments, decent stock stereo, lots of room and very comfortable. The end result, I love it! "
buick,rendezvous,2006,coywolf, 12/30/2007,06 RDV CXL 3.6L,4,"Gave it a 8 for comfort due to the leather on the seats which make the seats firmer than cloth.  Vehicle ride comfort is awsome....smooth. Have driven all crazy weather conditions and never been stranded, AWD is ample. Clearance height is less than others, but at least I don't have to climb into it like other SUVs."
buick,rendezvous,2006,John, 01/08/2008,Riding comfort,4,"The ride is very comfortable. There is plenty of space with the third seat folded down for luggage or large purchases Home Depot or Best Buy. The gas mileage is fine for an suv, 25 mpg highway and 22 mpg overall.  No mechanical service has been required and it is comforting to know we have 50k or 48 months on the warranty."
buick,rendezvous,2006,Tim Weaver, 07/25/2005,I love this car,5,"My Rendezvous has been a pleasure to drive from the moment I first got behind the wheel. The quality of this vehicle is outstanding, from its very good looks, to fine details such as HVAC controls. Its fun to drive and handles very much like a luxury car, not a truck. I haul everything in it including my precious grandchildren.  I could not recommend it more highly."
buick,rendezvous,2006,Buckeyes1, 11/17/2005,3rd one in the Family,4,"I was very aware of this vehicle when I began looking for a smaller better MPG SUV for my expanding family. My father and sister had both purchased an 05 and both loved it. I personally did not want to buy the same thing and looked at every other option possible. When the red tag sale started for GM I went pricing out the Equinox, Torrent, Vue, a Liberty, and some foreign SUVs. After all of this I told my Pontiac sales rep jokingly that if the deal was good enough I would consider an Rendezvous.  He came back and said we may have what you are looking for. My wife drove it and loved it instantly compared to the others.Long story short we now have three in the family and got the most for our money"
buick,rendezvous,2006,Ernie, 03/10/2006,Value SUV,5,"My first Buick and love it! The build quality is on the level of Lexus to me.  I can't figure out why Consumer Reports say the interior is cheap, it is indeed far from it.  The fit, finish and materials are top shelf.  I've own two Azteks and it is amazing that they come from the same plant.  The Azteks had many shortcomings for a sister SUV.  I purchased the leather option and this is the way to go."
buick,rendezvous,2006,marktv, 04/22/2006,A truly nice & capable vehicle,4,"I shopped around for months until I found what suited myself and the family best.  I cannot see why Honda and Toyota are priced so much more.  The Buick rides nice, looks nice, appears well built, and I'm averaging 24 mpg city/hwy. Sure, it has things that can annoy the owner.  What vehicle doesn't? But, they are too minor to mention.  Consumer reports called the interior 'cheap', but I found the Toyota Sienna had a much more cheap feel.  I think CR really has an anti GM bias.  The Rendezvous doesn't do anything excellent, but for me it does everything very well I bought a prior rental with 9850 miles and saved thousands.  GM still has a problem with depreciation."

Love the moveable second row seats, allows great flexibility and ample room when the rear seat is needed for the kids and their friends. Given that my lease payments are relatively low, its a good value for an suv that seats 7 but rides like a car. Things I don't like: gas tank gauge dips way down when on a hill, it actually wouldn't start when i had almost a qrtr tank, roadside guy said this is a problem w/the vehicle, must use qrtr line as ""empty""; the interior lighting stinks, no over head light near the front, little lights on rear view mirror don't help, makes it hard to see stuff; gas goes real quick."
buick,rendezvous,2006,Peter Thorvig, 03/31/2006,Buick Rendezvous,5,"The design of the Rendezvous is ideal for my needs. The tie-down rings are an excellent feature. The size of the vehicle makes it easy to maneuver in city traffic, and to park. The Rendezvous has excellent visibility with the big, outside mirrors. The rear parking assist is a very useful feature. "

I was in love my Windstar but with 18 gal compare to 26 it makes a big difference.The Rendevous is of course is shorter in length than the Windstar. But the Rendevous makes up for all the sassy design and features. If you're looking for the crossover vehicle with comfort class and price, then go check out the Rendevouus. Once you go for a test drive you will be driving it home the same day. Happy Motoring !!!!"

We have had 2 minivans prior to this, but our children are now in college, so the Rendezvous is a perfect fit for our lives now. The AWD is wonderful to have on snow and ice, and makes a real difference in handling. Our only real complaint concerns the very tall front seat headrests. They are rather difficult to see around-you really need to turn around to see sufficiently when backing up. Other than that, the Rendezvous is very comfortable, handles and rides like a car, and is very quiet. We love it!"
buick,rendezvous,2006,barb9, 03/22/2007,2006 CXL 3.6 VVT,4,"This is the Rendezvous Buick should of had when staring the RDV line. I purposely sought out to buy the Rendezvous with the 3.5 engine when I heard about it.  I previously owned a 2002 CX 3.4 that was slightly underpowered at times when you needed power, but got good gas mileage. This 3.5 engine gives me better mileage and lots of power. Unfortunately to buy this model requires buying all the bells and whistles. A small trade off for a wonderful engine. Have owned it for almost a year and nothing wrong with it (unlike my 2002).  Up to 2006, the Rendezvous had the biggest cargo room of any midsize SUV/CUV and tied for top spot in fuel efficiency.  Too bad they are ending the Rendezvous, I would buy another (3rd) one!"
buick,rendezvous,2006,TOM D, 11/09/2007,Nice Vehicle For Price,4,"Nice vehicle for price. Smooth, quiet. Adequate power for everday driving, plus uses only regular fuel."
buick,rendezvous,2006,Mike Sadkowski, 12/03/2007,A year later and I still love it,4,"I bought the SUV about a year ago and did not have any problems with it. I love the comfort and the smooth ride it offers. The vehicle is roomy and well designed. This is one of those cars that grows on you. When I first bought it, I didn't really care for the exterior design. I purchased the car due to it's outstanding reliability ratings, awesome price ($16K with 4K miles), and the driving comfort (less road noise than my parent's MDX!). But the exterior design grew on me. I love my Rendezvous. I would buy another, but unfortunately  they don't make them anymore.  If you find one with low miles and a good price, don't think twice, buy it!  "
buick,rendezvous,2006,Happy Driver, 04/11/2008,"Great Car, Great Handling",5,"Great overall vehicle. AWD is handy feature. Quiet, smooth ride for all passengers. 3rd row seat has just enough leg room/head room for 5'10"" person. Lower clearance, although not great for huge snowfalls, is nice for disabled parent to enter/exit. Good storage."
buick,rendezvous,2006,Dennis, 04/20/2008,D's Review,4,Wife's car and she loves it. Very reliable and fun to drive. Fuel economy is in the 20's. Dash layout is very pleasing and easy to use. She drives 60 miles a day to work and back wich gives her a good feeling as to the ride and dependabilty of the auto.
buick,rendezvous,2006,Rendezvous driver, 05/13/2008,"Good SUV, best in its class",4,"I hated it when I bought it, its more of a woman car, so I gave it to my wife and she loves it. Then I started driving it and I'm actually liking it. I bought it 2 years ago and now ~42k on it. Had a deer accident going 70 mph. I thank god to be driving a Rendezvous, very well maintained, very stable, the deer was split in half. Went to the shop for 2-3 months, came back never the same car. But I can tell you, its very reliable. After the accident the fuel economy became poor average 20 mpg, I used to avg 23 - 24. But I'm pleased with it. Very spacious and comfortable. I'm 300 lbs and 6,1"" but it would be better to have a lot more driver leg space. Back sensor excellent"
buick,rendezvous,2006,Buick lover, 12/19/2019,Bells and whistles,4,"I bought this SUV 3 1/2 years ago and I still love it. It's been a great car overall except. . . Once the engine is good and warm if you accelerate to quickly so if the dash lights will start blinking and alarms ding until you get up to speed and let of the accelerator. Then the AWD DISABLE  light will stay on until you turn off the car. It doesn't seem to actually affect the actual running of the vehicle and will still get to where I need it to go. It has made several trips to Kansas from Oklahoma and 3 trips to Tennessee. I am not going to retire it and turn it into a teenager vehicle. This is the 2nd Buick I have owned and am not disappointed.  All vehicles need repairs when buying used so you can't expect perfection. I will purchase another Buick

First, my best mileage is only about 12.5-13.5 mpg, no matter if I am driving around town or on the highway.  Dealership says nothing is wrong and nothing they can do.  Now, lets talk about the problems with this piecd of junk. The left front struts had to be replaced in the first three months. Gears in the steering mechanism were replaced in month 4. In the 6th month, the transmission went out. Month 9, the power steering unit had to be replaced.  I am not a bad driver nor drive in a reckless manner. I am a 65 year old lady who does not know where to turn.  "

buick,rendezvous,2007,adamsmith1, 01/21/2007,From BMW to Buick?,5,"I am an owner of a BMW M5 and an Audi S4. But I needed a vehicle with genuine luggage capacity for a vacation. I rented a Rendezvous CXL. I really liked it. My wife really liked it. Even our college-bound son admitted he liked it.The Rendezvous offered very comfortable seats and comfortable ride, quiet  and reasonable horsepower, though I always would like more. It provides a great view and command of the highway and there was no difficulty in handling city driving. I had been  considering the purchase of a BMW X5 as an SUV but I am now seriously considering a Rendezvous CXL, or Buicks successor to the Rendezvous, the Enclave. Congratulations to a fine American car."
buick,rendezvous,2007,pjk2, 10/20/2012,Extremely reliable vehicle...,5,"We own 4 Buicks of different years which have all turned out to be extremely reliable.
our 2007 Ruby red Rendezvous has 108 cu feet of cargo space .. more than any CUV it's size... and gets a easy 25mpg even going up and down the hilly highways of PA.. I change my own brakes and the Lucas all alloy brakes are very easy to change rotors and pads... never had a bolt stick because the alloy does not rust. The ride is very comfortable and quiet.
Take care of this car and it will take care of you. At 4,000lbs it will be safer than the tiny SUVs I see running around with more interior space and the option to take out the rear seats. Very good practical vehicle."
buick,rendezvous,2007,bartlw, 12/19/2006,Buick Rendezvous,5,"This is one of the best handling cars that I have ever owned. The Rendezvous CXL is very comfortable when driving in town or out on the highway. The heads-up display keeps your eyes on the road and not looking down to set your cruise. The instrument panel is laid out to see your gauges, but are also shown in the heads-up display. My wife drove a Buick LaCrosse, but to her the Rendezvous gives her a comfortable ride and the ease of driving a small car in traffic, but doesn't feel like a full size SUV. It's very nicely equipped and for the money it's a good car to own. I read some of the reviews on the 2005 & 2006 Rendezvous, I feel like a lot of the complaints have been fixed on the 2007 model."
buick,rendezvous,2007,Gabster, 01/20/2007,Unbelievable,5,"Buick is a step ahead of other competitors, even with GM. I got the CX with all the options available on it. I like the CX because the exterior mirrors are shiny black. The CXL uses body color. I leased this car and was very surprised. It is a luxury SUV with an msrp of $30,000.  I leased it for under $400 sign and drive. I have never driven a car that is so refined and drives so smoothly. Another thing going for it is the standard rear park assist. It really helps avoid accidents. Most luxury cars like Benz don't even offer it standard. I can't live without OnStar anymore. I always forget my cell, but I dont need to worry anymore. Leaving my keys in car is a problem too, but no worries anymore. It has features that only the Americans can think of like comfort level and huge compartments. The second row has 2 center pieces that fold away. That means that this car is really wide. It is going to last a long time, will buy again"
buick,rendezvous,2007,melissa jacobs, 11/20/2006,My Buick Rendevous,4,"I'm very happy with the truck. I wish it had front sensors too. The driver's mirrors on the outside of the truck are a great size. I'm really able to see what's coming up on me. I love the OnStar in it. I would love to get another one when my time is up. I would definitely recommend this car to anyone, plus I already get a lot of compliments on it now."
buick,rendezvous,2007,Eric Zatman, 09/07/2016,Nice ride for an older SUV,4,"The Buick Rendezvous was in production from 2002-2007 and was discontinued after the 2007 model year.  I bought this mid-size from Fitzgerald Chevrolet in Frederick, MD. It was a one owner car with 150k miles. So far, I have put over 1,500 miles on this Rendezvous mostly highway miles.  I like the spacious cabin and outward view of the road.  I have put two bikes in the cargo area with the back seats folded down.  The 3.5 liter 6 cylinder engine runs well though slightly underpowered going up steep hills.  Gas mileage is acceptable on the highway. This  was a one owner vehicle which had 150k miles so I was a bit concerned about buying the car.  However, one reviewer a reporter from Chicago wrote an article about his Rendevous that has over 300k miles doing just  routine maintenance.  Other reviewers have expressed concern over reliability of the Rendevous and these may have been from particularly earlier model years.  Nonetheless, I am taking a chance expecting to keep my Rendevous as an interim car for travel and biking.
Update:  as others noted, the brake system in the Rendezvous is problematic when turning the wheels causing stuttering and anti lock braking problems.  The windshield wipers locked up once which was unnerving  The vehicle started leaking oil.  As this vehicle was high mileage, we took a chance on it knowing we would drive it until problems surfaced.  We did like that it had lots of space for our bikes and used it for one vacation trip.  However, we sold it when the oil leaks and braking problems became expensive repairs.

not particularly fond of the looks of this but thought it was a good deal. Suprisingly after owning it for 6 monthsI am in love with my rende!Understand reasons for the discontinue but I have had rendezvous owners stop me and talk about why they love their rendezvous.

Great ride, features and size. Went to lease another one this year, we lease new every 3 years, and was sad to hear that they don't make the Rendezvous any more. They tried to get us into an Enclave.  Enclave is 17 inches longer and $15,000 more.  We are keeping the Rendezvous."

Have done routine maintenance on it in the 10 years I've owned this 2006 Rendevous CXL.  I bought it with 9K miles on it, certified used.  The CXL version is the better one as it has leather and nicer appointments.  It also has Sirius radio capability.  My elderly mother with mobility problems was able to easily enter and exit this SUV without using a step.  Visibility is very good and the backseat is roomy with a pull-down arm rest with cup holders.  I have the model with three rows of seats but always have them locked down for cargo.  It also has CD and tape cassette players which allow me to enjoy some of my old tapes.  Of course, there are no USB ports or bluetooth, and no backup camera or GPS systems.  I'm about to sell my old friend with some reluctance.

This CXL replaced a noisy, cheapo, gas-guzzler Honda Odyssey XL- no luxury features even available! Liked a rented Rendezvous on Florida vacation. Later compared it to the Lexus SUV -cramped and boring. The Buick is larger inside and $20K cheaper. Quiet, luxurious, versatile and 22.5 mpg thrifty. Comforts of the car are on par with our Avalon sedan. 7 people can ride if needed & with the middle seats out, we carry 3 dogs and luggage for trips. It has been great in the snow even in our hilly neighborhood. Love the car. Sad that GM made the dumb decision to discontinue & replace it with a bulbous gas guzzler."

We purchased ours for $10,000 under original list price. While not a Lexus by any means, it is still half the price for similar comfort and capacity. Great warranty coverage. Our only real complaint is that the 3.5 engine could have been the 3.6 with better power and mileage. Also, the radio stinks. An aftermarket radio is in our future."

I got an incredible value when i bought the car as the Rendezvous was at the end of it's run.  The styling hadn't changed much in the last few years but we liked the way it looked and the interior was very nice.  What surprises me is that I consistently get 23 mpg on the highway.  This is better than i get with my Nissan Murano which is much smaller???  In local driving i get around 16 which is painful when gas is $4+ a gallon but reasonable when you consider the size and 7 passenger capacity.  I have 31,000 miles and am still going strong! "

Since buying it in 2007 with 13k miles I've had to spend $6k more in repairs due to persistent inability of car to start including faulty wiring, axle and wheel train replacement of loose or prematurely broken parts, and a brake job. In the 11 years that I owned a subaru, I never had to do any more than change the oil. For this car I had to even subscribe to onstar for peace of mind because the car is so unreliable. Based on the quality of this car I can see how GM got themselves into thier current setuation. Let a free market economy rule!! I am headed back to the Subaru dealership for a new car. "
buick,rendezvous,2007,Shocked, 02/24/2007,Unbelievably Unsafe,1,"We were absolutely shocked to learn that this vehicle is the only GM vehicle (including all other Buick models) that includes rear seat seatbelts that do not ""lock"" unless or until it becomes necessary. Subsequently, small children have the ability to ""hang"" and ""dangle"" from the seatbelts. Should the seatbelts reliably ""lock"" when needed (not proven), children are at risk for severe injury if they are not sitting upright or if the belt literally ""snaps"" them backwards. Utterly ridiculous and absolutely unsafe for children. We returned our vehicle within days of taking delivery. All research indicates that even the slightest slack in the belt increases substantially the risk of head/neck injury"

They finally left a computer connected for a few days n found the alternator was spiking the system. That was replaced n the car was fine until it rained the power steering went out, replaced that n nothing changed, then the water pump went out. The dealership worked wonders for me n found a way to put me in a new car n junked the rendezvous."
buick,rendezvous,2007,jjnewlife, 08/14/2008,Equal to imports for half the money,3,"After driving a friend's Lexus SUV I was not expecting much from this Buick. Surprise. We like it much better. Sure the dashboard is plain but we improved it by adding a wood grain kit. After 27,000+ miles our only real issue has been the radio which is junk. Three visits to the dealer have failed to have any effect. Gas mileage is incredibly poor for such a small V-6. We only get about 15mpg in town and 22 on the road. Our Impala with a similar engine gets at least 5mpg better. But, the Buick tows our small boat effortlessly, there is room galore with the seats folded and so far, it has been mechanically reliable. The 100,000 mile warranty inspires confidence."

Waiting to get that fixed. Passenger window cracked (factory defect) waiting for that part and the ceiling panel was hanging got that fixed. Still love the car but they should have made the driver seat more adjustable to move back further. Lots of room and comfy back seat that reclines.

The fuel economy has been terrible, average 16 mpg with a mix of highway and city driving.  My husband is 6'4 and when he is driving my children have no room for their legs in the back seat.  A car seat is out of the question behind him.  We have the split reclining middle row, not sure if this is why.  But, my kids absolutely hate this car.  Numerous problems, serviced the next day after purchase and should go in again but am to busy and because this is a lease I'm leaving with the noisy turns, poor gas mileage, poor leg room for children and the interior roof coming apart in the back.  Rear seat belts end up under the folding seat, hard to get."

Stereo system is awful. Will have to replace it. Will not even stay on local stations. It did stall one time in traffic with no explanation. We're praying this does not happen again. But, for the money (we purchased an off-lease car) it still seems a bargain. Mileage averaging 20mpg overall, not bad for a vehicle of this size and weight."
buick,rendezvous,2007,bob kambic, 02/25/2007,Spare Tire and Jack,3,"The spare tire is impossible to put back once taken from under the auto. The spare hangs by a crank cable system similar to other GM SUVs. However, directly under the spare is both a suspension strut and a part of the frame. So the tire is in a small keyhole. I used the spare and could not get it back into the keyhole. My neighbor and I by laying on the ground under the car were able to push and pull the spare back into the key hole. They should make every GM engineer who designed this do it every day."

It's to bad they opted to drop it in 2007, and rather than keep it and improve it, they come out with the enclave, a nice ride, but out of my price range. looking at the 2010 equinox. 32 mpg, i might have to trade the rendezvous in!!"

My wife loves being up above the traffic so she can see well in her trip to work and for her many trips on the Garden State Parkway. We did not want a 3rd seat and its great that Buick offers that option. It gives us more storage room. Love having dials and switches that we can actually read vs a ""symbol"". I own a LaSabre and really like Buick's quality. I am very, very dissapointed that they are discontiuing this car. I think they should have advertised this more.

buick,rendezvous,2007,George Schmidt, 04/17/2007,Rendezvous Rocks,5,"I wanted something a little larger than the RAV4 and CR-V, but still easy to manuever into tight parking spaces. In addition to the extra room, the smooth and quiet ride sold me on the Rendezvous. The V6 engine has enough power for almost every situation. This mid-size SUV feels nimble driving in the city, but is very stable and comfortable on the highway. Body lean during cornering is well controlled. The standard rear back-up sensors are very helpful. With the 3rd row folding seat (optional on the CX), the ability to hold an occasional 7 people is a nice feature.

When it came time to replace the mini van I was looking for something different, but something that still had a 3rd row and a reasonable price. By chance, I found out the Rendezvous did.  Took it for a test drive and fell in love. I found it to be comfortable, very roomy, and fun to drive. A quick check on other reviews and consumer reports gave high marks. The rebate was great.  Purchased it a week later.  Very satisfied.  "
buick,rendezvous,2007,Sandyflush, 05/24/2007,Second time owner,4,"I like it. It is a shame that Buick would take a SUV within middle class range up. Hey GM Buick, help us middle class out. We love the SUV. The Enclave is out of my league"
buick,rendezvous,2007,Mike, 06/12/2007,Nice vehicle Great Value!,4,"We purchased a loaded CX in February and now have about 3000 miles on it! My wife and I are very happy with the vehicle. It has a smooth and relatively quite ride and is enjoyable to drive. The vehicle has more than adequate acceleration for most situations. We seem to get about 19 to 20 mpg overall.  My wife really liked the looks of the Nissan Murano but with a $1300 discount off the list price, $5200 in rebates and $3300 of GM card credit, the bang for the buck we got with the Rendezvous was light years ahead of the Murano! We couldn't be happier!"
buick,rendezvous,2007,pjkPA, 06/26/2007,Great vehicle,5,"We just bought our 3rd Rendezvous. Just couldn't find a better vehicle for 20K. Nothing comes close to the amount of car you get for the money. OnStar. Stainless exhaust. Galvanized metal, and  seats that come out which makes more cargo room to haul things than any other SUV. I get 27 mpg on the highway and have gotten 28. Hard to find one now though. They are selling fast. My 2002 will need replaced just in time for me to buy a Chevy Volt unless Buick comes out with something to compete with it."
buick,rendezvous,2007,Peformance, 07/02/2007,Low speed acceleration,4,"Just bought the vehicle and have noticed that at low speed with the foot off the accelerator and then trying to accelerate again the vehicle does not engage immediately. I think the torque converter or accelerator (electronically controlled) is a problem. Love the styling, should have the trip computer (fuel economy  reading, oil change time, etc,) as standard like on my Chevy 05 Malibu. Disappointed with the storage compartments in the rear and the fact the second row seats do not slide per the brochure. Milage about 22 around town is excellent, ride is fantastic,  "
buick,rendezvous,2007,Momma P, 08/06/2007,Great Buy,5,"Afer having a baby, my husband and I knew that the Pontiac G6 that we owned was too small for a now family of 3. We looked and looked to find a SUV in our price range and found that all of the ones we were interested in were out of our range. We decided to take a look at roomier cars with the dealer that sold us our G6 and he informed us on a great buy with the Rendevous! We ended up paying roughly $30 more per month than what we were currently paying and got a roomier car all at once. The other little SUV's did not have nearly the space and were charging doulbe the price. We love our new car!"
buick,rendezvous,2007,Mike, 06/01/2007,Tremendous Value,5,"We were looking to replace one of our SUV's with a vehicle that provided better gas mileage without sacrificing cargo capacity.  My wife did not want a minivan or a car as a replacement. She enjoys the driving position that an SUV provides. Like most buyers, we initially looked at the offerings from the imports.  Friends of ours went through the same process about a year ago and ended up buying a 2006 Rendezvous. Both he and his wife highly recommended it. After test driving a 2007 Rendezvous we became a believer.  With the current rebate we ended up buying a fully loaded CXL for the price of a stripped down import.  If ride, roominess and mileage are important consider the Rendezvous."

The kids can watch movies or hook their xbox up to it.  It has 2 household plugs in it, a compressor with an air hose!  No matter how much weight there is in it, it adjusts in the rear and it is never sagged down.  I have folded the seats down and put a full size refrigerator in it.  It sits up high like an SUV, but, I LOVE the sliding doors in parking lots and the garage.  It is front wheel drive, but, goes through snow like a charm!
"
buick,terraza,2005,silveeto, 04/17/2013,Problem after problem.,2,"Oct 2017 update:
This year I finally hit my breaking point and said enough is enough. This money pit pulled its last joke on me after leaving me stranded in a Walmart parking lot with a seized starter. I went out the next week and financed a brand new Mazda and kick myself for not doing this sooner. I lived in denial for far too long that this was a good van for the low price I paid for it. I recently tallied up the amount I spent on repairs/maintenance in my time owning it and was shocked to discover I spent more keeping it on the road than I did purchasing it. 

If you love troubleshooting weird and unending vehicle problems, this van is for you! Otherwise I’d say just walk away... you couldn’t pay me to drive another one of these. 

I’ll leave my earlier reviews up as they list a lot of the issues, and you can also see my enthusiasm dwindle down to pessimism over time lol. Good riddance Terraza!  


Oct 2016 update:
Transmission packed it in at about 170,000km (approx 106,000miles). Rear callipers have a parking brake component that seized and needed a full caliber replacement on the rear. After the transmission rebuild ($2500) it seems to be back in action and running well. I guess I'll wait and see what falls apart next on me.  

UPDATE:
I've owned it for 2 years now and I still love it. It has had a few problems though. This chassis (terraza, relay, Uplander, and SV6) is apparently notorious for wheel bearings going. I've been through two bearings on each side of the front, and both sides on the back have been replaced once. Ridiculous right? I'm handy enough, so they're easy enough to change, but come on.... seriously? Twice in 2 years?! Also, I had an ongoing issue with the ABS/traction/stability system light triggering. Took me a while to figure out - but it ended up being as simple as changing the wire harness that runs from the wheel hub to the computer. The wire is cheap and gets brittle over time and even though it looks ""ok"" the tiny wires inside fray and trip the system - haven't had an issue since replacing a couple years ago. 

The stereo had weird road/static noises and I didn't like the stock deck anyway so I upgraded to a Kenwood GPS/DVD deck and it's been fantastic ever since as the stock speakers/sound is actually really decent. This also solved an issue with the side sliding door alarm ringing ENDLESSLY. The stereo DVD deck I installed bypassed the door chime so I have sweet, sweet silence now! Hope this helps other owners. Despite the problems I really do still love driving it. Everything else about it has been great!


ORIGINAL REVIEW:
I just bought my Terraza recently. It has been maintained so well that I'm pretty sure and elderly couple or a super clean freak family had it. It smells like new car, not a stain or a worn spot to be found. At a low 90,000km it looks as though it could have 10km on the clock - so I'm very excited just at how clean it is. 

In my time driving it, my only complaint is the transmission. Sometimes it doesn't seem to know what it wants to do. I stomp it for power on the highway and it launches into 6000rpm and sounds like it's about to explode. A little scary - I don't want to face a tranny rebuild so soon in the game. Aside from that, driving around town and so forth, she's the smoothest ride I've ever owned.

buick,terraza,2005,Brand Hirsch, 05/24/2016,nickles and dimes my %*# hundreds and thousands,2,"In the past I have had good luck with Buick's. This is not the case with my Terraza. We bought it new in 2005. First 2 years were good, no repairs no problems. From the third year to present we have had nothing but problems. First problem luckily was still covered under warranty. The van kept dying on us or, would not start intermittently with, this issue we had it in the dealership 3 times and, once to a very good independent mechanic. first 2 times dealership replaced fuel pump, computer, multiple relays, and the computer a second time. We took it to the independent the third time he said he could find nothing wrong and, we need to take it back to the dealership since it was under warranty and, charged us a very minimal fee. The dealership replaced multiple parts. I DO HAVE TO COMMEND THEM as, there are clearly issues electrically and mechanically from the factory that are extremely difficult to solve. CV joint failure, big time suspension issues in the rear witch the dealership worked on three time the 3rd year, they never got it right, road like a buckboard for months. They finally got the rear suspension to feel like a 3/4 ton truck witch was a big improvement. constant traction control issues, stability, rotor,, rear dvd player, headlights, taillights, dash cracks ,broken door handles issues, trim falling off, doors not opening or closing, interior cracking breaking falling apart.  My god man, I need to go back and change my review, until I started listing the issues I did not realize what a true P.O.S. this mini van really is, mechanically. I have been working on it myself for the last few years there is no way a person could justify shop rates for as many times it needs work. I am a pretty fair hand at fixing  cars and, I'm here to tell you this thing is a nightmare. never, never, never, consider buying one, don't even take one as a gift you cant afford the repairs. With this being said, it is a very sharp mini van with good power and mileage. We loved everything about it I, bragged to my friends and family for the first 3 years. It could have been one of the favorite vehicle's that I had owned, if it had not turned into a unbelievably unreliable basket case. Great concept poor execution G.M.
"
buick,terraza,2005,Mike I, 10/07/2015,Most trouble prone car I've ever owned,1,"Let me start by saying that I have owned some of the most unreliable makes on the road.  Fiats, Alfas, Jaguars, etc.  The Buicke Terraza, which we purchased new in 2005, has been the worst by far.

It now has 145k miles on it.  I would have unloaded it years ago but after each expensive repair you think, ""what else can go wrong?""   The Terraza never fails to answer that question.

In the years since we have owned it, let's see.

It has had the transmission fail twice.

It has used about a quart of oil every 1,000 miles since it was new.  GM says that is is within normal usage parameters.  Hmm, I have had other vehicles with 300k on the odometer that use essentially nothing every 3k miles.  

Have replaced every single suspension component, front and rear, at least once.

Front brake rotors are essentially an annual replacement. Dow not matter what brand rotor or pads, the rotors eventually warp.

Let's look at the components driven by the serpentine belt.  Water pump, AC compressor, alternator, power steering pump.  Yup, every one of those has been replaced.

All sorts of electrical issues almost since new.

CV axles.  Yes. This as well.

Exhaust. Ok, that lasted a long time so not too bad.

Heater core leak.  Been there, done that.

Leather cracking at front seats and arm rests.  Yes, also a crack in the dash.

Steering rack.  Yes. Last month as a matter of fact.

Engine mounts.  If your Terraza has lots of noise and harshness, these arprobanpy shot.

I maintain all my vehicles extremely well and they tend to last a very long time. Frequent fluid changes, interior / exterior detailing, etc.   Who knows what other problems this lemon would have if not maintained

It is reaonably quiet.  Engine is harsh and could use a few more HP.  Highway mileage is decent, around town about the same as my V8 SUV.  Front seats are comfortable, rear seats have terrible leg room, third row is difficult to access.  Front cup holders fall apart, few poor outlets poorly located.

my experience with the Terraza has left me saying, never again to GM.

buick,terraza,2005,kyukido, 09/29/2015,Loaded Lemon,1,"We've owned it for about 3 years now.  The car came loaded with all the accessories (DVD, electric heated leather seats, electric doors).  It does have a good engine, and nice acceleration but other than that, it's the worst lemon of a car I've ever owned. 

We bought this car used and have had nothing but problems with it.  The DVD player stopped working after about two years.  The steering leaks, one sliding door doesn't work at all anymore, not even manually!  The fob stopped working (even with a new battery), the strap to close the back gate broke, the warning bell that a door may be open goes off when you go over a bump and there's NOTHING you can do to make it stop.  The door lock button had to be replaced, the driver side window fell off its track.  The catalytic converter needs to be replaced.  The rear gate leaks.  Climate controls are HORRIBLE.  It's impossible to keep the windows free and clear of frost in the winter.  God forbid you try to change a headlight or turn signal on this thing yourself.  

It truly amazes me that I don't see more people complaining about this car.

It has been great for getting a lot of kids where they need to go and has been very reliable so far.

I fell in love at first sight. Mine is fully decked with every possible option including 17 inch chrome wheels. I've owned many vehicles in the past, but none of them have been as multi-functional as this big shiny Buick. Whether it's used for Home Depot, greenhouses, people hauling thru Rocky Mountains, or driving to the theatre, this van does it with ease and finesse. It has enough power when fully loaded while making my way home from vacations. It does not have the roar of my Mercedes, but I did not buy it for that reason. "

Nothing but problems.  Drivers side power door had been ""fixed"" six times now.  Yeah, right.  Number seven is right around the corner.  Tranny slipping horribly.  Radio turns off by it self at random.  Headlights flicker.  Heated seats do not work anymore.  Pass. power seat broken.  Carpet stains very easy.  Door handles break often.

This is our third minivan (one Japanese, one American, all fully loaded) and I can tell you that this is the best one we've ever had!  From the remote start to the wireless DVD player to the automatic doors to the dual climate control to all that storage space - Buick, you've hit a home run!

I have had the van in the dealer 6 times for a reoccurring problem with drivers side power sliding door not closing and sending a constant alarm.  Even when van is turned off, still alarms.

In 12,800 mile over 11 months, there hasn't been a single blip of any kind.  The interior is just beautiful I had compared Mercury Monterey, Windstar, Chrysler, Sienna, Odyessy and other GM, but none of them compare to feel and look of quality. There are many fine touches in car. Only negative is that I wish GM would adopt Chrysler's stow and go seating.  Second row seats are hard to remove/replace.  Great ride on trips."

DVD system, XM radio, dual climate controls, back-up assist, OnStar, security system, and the very beautiful and classy interior.  It's obvious that our boys love both power side doors and the IR headphones.

The onboard entertainment packages can't be beat. I also find it to ride and drive very smooth and quiet.  There is not alot of cargo room though, for things such as groceries.  I guess something had to give, to seat 7 passengers comfortably.  Overall, I give it a thumbs up.  Plenty of power and great gas mileage for your average ""soccer mom"".

I told the dealer ""I need something that has enough space for photography backdrops and equipment, is comfortable to drive, looks good, gets better than 20 mpg, and it CAN'T be a minivan.""  He showed me one. It was big enough. He said the only other suggestion was their new minivan that was 'right there'.  ""Where?"" He had to point it out because, ladies, this is not a minivan.

Dials are easy to read, 2 sliding doors are great. There are only a few minor design details that I would change if I were the designer ... the 3rd row seats are hard to lift once they have been lowered forward as there is no strap or handle to grip and lift..I'm short & would love ""move forward"" pedals to keep me back from the airbag..hotter heat.  Compared to Honda's Odessy, and for the money, I have all the bells & whistles for a lot less.  I find it is a exciting vehicle to drive. Gas Mileage about 16-17 mpg/city  "

The vehicle had 13,000 miles on it and was showroom new. It had everything i was looking for and I was hooked after the test drive. It rides smooth and has plenty of power. The 3.5L engine is not going to blow anyone's doors off, but it cruises effortlessly at 80 mph. The interior and exterior styling are very sharp and it has plenty of standard options like dual climate control power sliding doors, power seats and a dvd player.  I have not noticed any of the problems indicated in other reviews such as lack of room, power, or road noise that interferes with conversations. It rides like a Caddy!"

"
buick,terraza,2005,Noah, 08/20/2015,Typical Early 2000's GM Quality,2,"This is the car my family bought used a few years ago, and I wish they had done research first. It is better than the '98 Venture we had, but not by much. I will address build quality first, and frankly the build quality is disappointing. Basically the whole interior is hard plastic (the dashboard of my grandmother's '96 Bonneville is softer), and there are noticeable gaps between many of the panels. There is padding on the upper door panels, but it is very minimal. Fortunately, we have not had problems with the power doors like other people have. We have, however, experienced the very common light flicker problem.

This car drives poorly. It crashes over bumps in the road and the entire interior rattles. There is also a lot of wind noise at highway speeds. Acceleration isn't actually that bad, because although the engine is somewhat underpowered, it can get the car going if you just push the RPMs a little. Another thing, though, is that the transmission isn't particularly smooth when shifting.

Interior comfort isn't terrible. The third-row seats are kind of stiff, but I don't think they've ever really been used. The other two rows of seats have full-size cushions, which is nice, but there is no lumbar support and no kind of adjustment for it. Additionally, like I mentioned before, padding on the front doors is minimal. Legroom in the second row is barely enough, and the third row actually has more legroom than the second.

This car has also developed several problems that compromise safety. The wheels are beginning to corrode, I believe, resulting in a slow tire leak (a common problem here in Minnesota, where we heavily salt our roads in the winter). We had to have the steering done because it was starting to leak fluid. The most recent problem is one that we've had before. The brakes go crazy, the traction control kicks in when it's not needed, and sometimes the ABS/traction control lights come on and the information screen flashes ""service ABS"", ""service traction control"", and ""service stability system"".

Other miscellaneous things include: somewhat sub-par gas mileage (about 17 mpg), the unimpressive CD player (randomly stops working), and visibility (hindered by full-size rear headrests and thick C-pillars).

This car has not aged well while we've had it. Being a minivan, of course it gets driven often. But that also means problems can develop more quickly. The problems I mentioned aren't even all of the problems we've had since we got it. Those are just the recent problems and I fear we may encounter more. Even my mother, who mostly just wants a car that will get her from A to B, is getting frustrated. If you own a Terraza, Uplander, Montana, or Relay, please be careful and, if you are able, maybe find a different vehicle?

buick,terraza,2005,Margaret C, 01/14/2017,Amazing what a grille and chrome can do,5,"Although this is the same vehicle as the Venture and Montana, it has a really upscale look.  I bought the car as a daily rental with about 35k miles on it for a little more than half of the original price.  I have had very few problems with the car.  I still like the car and it is very attractive and seldom seen as they only made it for a couple years.
"
buick,terraza,2005,Good Soccer Mom, 03/04/2019,Longest owned vehicle of my life,5,"I've had this van for 10 years, bought at 18,000 miles in 2009!  Repair & maintenance has averaged under $600/year over the life of ownership (less than $50/month to maintain).  The only thing I desired was better gas mileage and a second sliding door (but that's what our used van came with - one power - one manual).  Entertainment is a dream and so is the long road trips with this van.  So much luggage room behind the 3rd row and cup holders galore!  I've owned two other minivans and they lacked so much in comparison.  This is by far my favorite family vehicle I've owned with no regrets!
"
buick,terraza,2005,mmills, 07/19/2008,Yikes,4,"Wish I had seen these reviews before we bought this. Lots of trouble--some of the same as others. The stability control also went out at about 7,000 miles. Nothing like the brakes slamming on when driving! Fixed now and no problems, but lots of tire, wheel issues now. Have to replace tires at 27,000 all hubs replaced. New tires aren't covered. Dealership blames on lack of rotating--seems like this is a problem on most. It is definitely a lemon but doesn't qualify as one."
buick,terraza,2005,Butteview, 05/06/2009,Love This Van! Even After Nearly 4 Years,4,"I replaced a GMC Suburban with this van. I needed lots of cargo space and this has just 1.5 cubic feet less than my Suburban with the middle seats out and the rear seats folded flat. The storage in the rear, appearance and features sold me on this car. According to the computer, I get just a little better mileage than on the sticker. 18+/24+. I get especially good mileage on the highway. Accelerating really seems to burn gas. I got this van to take to dog shows and it is perfect. Mine has everything but heated leather seats. I would ordered that. I did not get good service from this particular Dealer."
buick,terraza,2005,Fred, 09/03/2010,Great car for travel!,4,"Bought new in January,2005, our car now has 83,000 miles and has performed flawlessly.  We have made several trips of more than 900 miles in one day with trade-off of drivers, and the comfort of its seats make that no problem.  Mileage on trips is usually about 23 MPG, more at lower speeds. No repairs required except rear hubs became warped and noisy at 50,000 miles.   Tires had to be replaced at 60,000 miles- good but not the 81,000 miles our 98 Oldsmobile van got.  The interior design is very classy and car has many quality features.      We wish GM would make more vans and not push everyone towards SUV's which are not nearly as economical and versatile."
buick,terraza,2005,david, 01/28/2005,"Buick Terraza, very nice",4,"A realy great ride, solid and luxurious and safe. It does have side air curtains. A confident, quiet ride."
buick,terraza,2005,tony, 11/24/2005,Overpriced for this vehicle,2,"Terrible build quality. Noisy,hard riding, terrible glove compartment. Middle seats don't adjust far enough. Engine underpowered. For the money buy the Honda Oddessy. Test drove it after I purchased the Buick, no comparison. Honda wins, big time. My mistake, I should of test drove the vehicle."
buick,terraza,2005,Cat, 10/20/2005,"Many, Many Problems",2,"Yes, it does look nice and have many nice features, but the problems (11) I have had for the past seven months far outweigh the good.  Neither Buick nor the dealer will do anything to compensate me for my loss of security in this vehicle.  it  The last and biggest problem was while driving on a major highway on a crowded Saturday afternoon, the steering completely locked up, the traction control light and service stability system lights came on, I had no ability to steer, use the gas or brake, the van kept swerving from side to side. Cause is faulty steering wheel sensor, but because of the other problems that were supposedly fixed but weren't, I will never feel safe in this vehicle again."
buick,terraza,2005,R Shipp, 01/21/2009,Van has been good,4,This has been one of the better vans I have driven. Handles well in the Canadian winters and is very stable on the highway. Though I do mostly highway diving the mileage is great for this size of vehicle. 30 to 34 MPG(CDN) & 18 MPG in the city. I have not had any of the problems that I have seen written or heard about. Though I did feel the brakes needed replacing much sooner than I expected. I have noticed the road noise is getting louder and there are a few rattles here and there and I feel the temperature may have somethin to do with it. The warmer it is the less the noise.
buick,terraza,2005,wayne, 03/05/2009,Dont buy one,3,"We like the van but have had to much trouble with it. I want go into averything but the biggest this is what were having trouble as I write this. The starter keeps on turning after the motor cranks. It will stop the motor dead. You hae to crank it again and sometimes it takes three times befor you can drive. Have had it back three times and today was told it was a normal thing this van does and would have to live with it. Can you beleave that.  Buick want install a new starter and its still under the 36 thousand ,3 year  coverage. Guess we will be useing the North Carolina lemon law. Going to give them a few more days.Dont Buy one. You will be sorry."
buick,terraza,2005,HORRIBLE VECHICLE, 06/28/2009,What is not broken?,2,"1)Oil leak between transmission and engine. 2)Electrical problems:Alternator and battery replaced because headlights and interior lights were dimming and going bright.3) Radio replaced due to background noise.  DVD player had background noise still after noise suppressor added to +12Volt line.4) Stability control module replaced.  5) Electronic brake module replaced. 6) Power window control module replaced due to retaining clips broken. 7) Wind noise present: replaced sliding door molding.  Still had it. 8) Ground effects coming off. 9) Something rolling around loose in steering wheel.  Most failures occurred by 16,000 miles.  The rest occurred before 30,000 miles.  Do not trust this van!!"
buick,terraza,2005,kirkdouglas, 02/13/2010,No problems here,4,"I Got this van at a low cost, so i was willing to check it out no matter what other people said in there reviews. I have to say that it has been nothing but good times for me and my family, no problems to speak about. "
buick,terraza,2005,Brian, 07/16/2010,The Ultimate Minivan,4,"My wife swore she would never drive a minivan, unless it was a Buick. We have no regrets. Buick has done a terrific job building this classy, well built versatile vehicle."
buick,terraza,2005,Tim Sawl, 01/29/2005,Terraza Great,5,I traded my Caravan in for this new Buick. The seats are very comfortable. The vehicle handles great. My wife used the traction control to get up our hill after a snow storm and she loved it. If you want comfort for your family this is your vehicle. Go look at the stow-go seats and then check out the Terraza. There is no comparison to the quality. A fun vehicle to drive and a great looking one too.
buick,terraza,2005,Ken C, 03/25/2005,My 1st minivan,5,"I was ready to buy a Mercury Premier, but tried this...what a great buy! It's so quiet inside, and comfortable!  I got heated seats...my wife insisted! The middle and back seats are as comfortable as the front, with plenty of leg room. The engine has plenty of get up and go, and I get 29 mpg on the road at 65 to 70. I""m very happy.  Try one out."
buick,terraza,2005,Fred Perrett, 04/12/2005,Our Mojo Box,4,"The Terraza is a wonderful ride.  We did however, blow a computer K module.  Buick repaired the problem and provided us with a Chevy Tahoe while the repairs were completed.  On our family trip to Florida from Michigan and back, we really enjoyed the comfort and ride."
buick,terraza,2005,Ray Zenoni, 04/12/2005,Great Vehicle,4,"Over the past several years I have rented quite a few mini-vans for group trips.  None compare with the Terraza that I recently purchased. I was looking primarily for a very comfortable and quite vehicle to transport people on fun day trips (rather than a vehicle to transport the kids to after school activities).  The Terraza is quiet, handles well, is very comfortable and basically a perfect fit for my requirments.  I have had it for several months now and I have driven it 2,000 miles in all types of weather.  I am so glad I got this vehicle.  This is my first Buick and I was impressed by the dealership, as well as this vehicle."
buick,terraza,2005,Larry H, 05/26/2005,Well Done Buick,4,"I traded in my Chevy Venture Warner Bros. Edition for this fully loaded CXL. I love the styling and the ride is very quiet. Improvements over the Warner Bros. include the XM radio, seats are 100% leather (no cloth inserts) Heated front seats, factory remote starter, steering wheel controls. Mechanically the cars drives a little stiffer but is more responsive. Gas mileage is down from the 3.4 engine. Chevy Venture with 3.4 averaged close to 29 mpg on highway according to trip computer, Terraza is between 25 and 26. Performance difference is hardly noticable, but I don't think my wife plans on racing it. Very nice vehicle, not just a repackaged Olds silouette."
buick,terraza,2005,A. Moore, 06/14/2005,Terraza CXL,4,"We looked at the Chevy version of this van also and by the time you put all of the options on it that the CXL had, the price was at least as much.  A Buick Century was our first new car and we loved it for 8 years but needed the extra room.  Our Buick dealer has a wonderful service department and that's what eventually sold us on it."
buick,terraza,2005,Ken, 08/11/2005,2005 Terraza,5,"This is my 1st minivan. I bought it so my 5 (soon to be 7) grandchildren could fit. I was impressed by the price, compared to Mercury & Chrysler, it was about $5,000 less. The car is very quiet (no need to shout so the people in the 3rd row can hear). The ride is super smooth, even in the 3rd row. All the seating is comfortable with plenty of leg room. I sat in all the rear seats before buying it, and was impressed by the passenger comfort (my sons & daughter are very tall, and they liked it). I wouldn't have bought the DVD at extra cost, but now I'm glad it's there...and my grandchildren are even happier. OnStar is a great necessity, especially for emergencies. "
buick,terraza,2005,Jerry C. Martin, 08/26/2005,Great car but under powered.,4,"I would rate the car at 9.2, and would give it a better rating if the car had a little more zip. "
buick,terraza,2005,EL PASO TX., 12/27/2005,"Kids Love It. Comfort, Options, Style",4,"Owning this vehicle has been a good experience so far. We have already taken a trip thru the mountains with 6 people in it and it drove great...no problems at all. Buick hit it right on the money with the look but I'm pretty sure they could have used better quality interior pieces.  The compartments do feel cheap and are sometimes hard to close.  It would have been nice if the back windows can roll down,  but over all its worth the money. We shopped around & compared prices.  With all the standard options it comes with a Honda or Toyota would have been at least $37,000. With the red tag sales you'll probably pay about $28,000 for a Buick Terraza.  $10,000 less. Gas is reasonable for a van."
buick,terraza,2005,bmgilb2036, 02/08/2006,Worst I have ever owned,2,"The only reason we bought this van was because of my wife's employee discount.  The 3.5 engine has no torque and constantly has to down shift to pull small grades. Front leg room is adequate if you starred in the Wizard of Oz as the mayor. Access to the third row is great if your name is Pegleg with the table folded flat. The genius who designed the back up warning lights never put the DVD screen down or he would have noticed that it blocks the lights.The seat system is from 1998. There might as well be a semi trailer attached as you can not see out the back window since the head rests are the size of Montana. And finally, I wanted to trade it, but it depreciated by $13000 in 11 months. Trash"
buick,terraza,2005,Lisa, 06/21/2006,Do not buy a Buick Terraza,3,"This vehicle has so many problems, we've had it in numerous times for the radio(4 times), the doors( could not get out of car, could not get in car you name it), noise coming from the front, lights flickering, door handles falling off, hatch falling on sons head, abs lights, traction control lights come  on saying not working, but dealer can find nothing wrong.  Do not buy this van."

buick,terraza,2005,Mary, 02/18/2005,Very Happy,4,"Love the quiet ride and feel. Handles great. Nicely designed dash and controls. Love the front end. It has all the features I have loved in my minivan, but he feel and look of an SUV... I've always thought the minvan was a more versatile, family friendly vehicle than most SUVs. ..and with power slidng doors, no fingers get caught and no doors get banged up with kids in and out. The Terraza nicely combines comfort and practicality"
buick,terraza,2005,sandbox, 02/24/2005,Terraza review,4,"The ride, the looks are all classic Buick lines. The non-traditional look of this mini van is what seperates it from the rest. It no longer looks like the mom mobile."
buick,terraza,2005,Chuck's Limo, 03/18/2005,A great vehicle for the dollar,5,"This is my second mini van, and it is by far the best I drove before buying it. The comfort, looks, and standard equipment is outstanding. The ride is excellent, and very controlled. I like the Traction Control, and Stabilitrak which are standard on the Terazza. I think the engine is just right for the vehicle. I have no trouble merging into traffic, or passing. Let's face it. Most passing today is done on an interstate highway while you are on cruise contol. You don't need all that power to get around another vehicle. On my first highway trip, I averaged 27.6 MPG. That with only 1200 miles on the clock. Not to shabby."
buick,terraza,2005,ED Buck, 04/06/2005,Great Van,4,This is the first Buick I ever own and I am amazed at the ride and how quiet it is. It's just great driving. I had a Chevy Asto before.
buick,terraza,2005,Lisa, 04/06/2005,I LOVE MY TERRAZA!!!!,4,"I love my Buick Terraza.  I like the fact that it has the exterior look of an SUV but the interior room and comfort of a mini-van!  It is definitely a vehicle my family and I needed.  We use the storage compartments often, the 12 cupholders actually come in handy with the children.  The third row seating lays flat for lots of room and storage in the rear when moving or transporting groceries and large items.  I would purchase this vehcile again!  There are some quirks they need to work out with it mechanically but overall the service I have received from the dealer has been great, too!  The quirks are very minor and do not affect the handling of the vehicle in anyway."
buick,terraza,2005,D&B, 04/23/2005,Suggested improvements.,3,I drove this vehicle on a 4000 mile trip in four weeks and would have liked to have had the changes that I have listed below.
buick,terraza,2005,Recliner King, 05/07/2005,Pleasantly Surprised,4,"I have over 6000 miles on my Terraza. I am very happy with the car overall. The kids get in easy. Heck I can get in and out very easy. And with the DVD I don't hear, ""Are the there yet"". The ride, the feel of the ""Van"" sometimes makes me forget it is a ""Minivan"". Average mileage 23 combined (60% highway, 40% city)"
buick,terraza,2005,Tom, 06/16/2005,"From an SUV to a ""Minivan""",5,"I have have my 2005 Buick Terraza CLX FWD for about a month.  The only drawback is that it is underpowered for a vehicle that is intended to be loaded up with people and gear.  The styling inside and out is well liked by me and everyone who sees it for the first time.  I have had strangers stop me and tell me that they really like the appearance of the Terraza!  The sliding doors are invaluable!  Get the remote start up feature, I absolutely love it. The seats are much more comfortable than my Chevy Trailblazer.  If only I could have that engine in this vehicle!  The interior is the best and classiest of all of the new crossover sport vans as these are being called (Chevy, Pontiac, Saturn)."
buick,terraza,2005,Ronald DeMarco, 07/06/2005,Weighted second seat,4,I have driven many SUV's and this is the first one to turn people's heads.The only problem is the middle seat is heavy and hard to remove. Chrysler has the right idea for the second seat.
buick,terraza,2005,Kim, 07/29/2005,WAY Better than the Grand Caravan,5,"We recently traded in our 2004 Grand Caravan for the Buick Terraza.  The Dodge seemed to have a lot of mechanical problems and we decided to take advantage of the employee pricing from GM.  We fell in love with the Terraza at first sight, but actually driving it was what won us over completely.  It is a very smooth, quiet ride. All of the many features are within easy reach (not so on the Dodge), and there is a lot more legroom in the middle and back seats.  Sure, the seats don't fold down magically into the floor, but I've sat in the new ""stow- and-go"" seats.  They definitely had to sacrifice comfort for function.  You will not find a more comfortable, easy to drive van than this one. "
buick,terraza,2005,Michael Wilson, 08/24/2005,The Best Value: Terraza,5,"Before I purchased the Terraza, I evaluated 5 other mini-vans:Oddessey, Quest, Monterey, Sienna and Freestar. I feel the Terraza is the best value based on price, options and performance. It has a very quiet ride and the turning radius of a normal size car.  It's very stable and doesn't have the typical ""tippy"" feel when rounding corners. The Terraza CXL has great interior styling with an SUV look outside.  The rest of the vans have either dated exterior styling (egg look) or mini vans are now an after thought (second fiddle) to their SUV product. I'm very pleased with the purchase and I would reccommend this van to anyone."
buick,terraza,2005,Dave, 09/29/2005,Great Vehicle,4,"I love everything about this vehicle except that it is slightly underpowered. We just completed a 500 mile all interstate trip at 70 mph and got 26 mpg, 2 more than posted for this vehicle. It drives, handles and rides very well - feels more like a car than a minivan. Excellent storage and seating comfort. Vehicle now has 4000 miles and no problems thus far. The grandkids love it, especially the DVD setup."
buick,terraza,2005,Tony, 10/13/2005,DO NOT GET THIS VAN!,3,This van has been in the shop a total of 6 weeks!  Problems that I have encountered include: Transmission...terrible gas mileage-13- 14MPG...wind noise to sliding doors and rattling...radio went out...problem with chasis and tie rod on wheel (2 weeks in shop)
buick,terraza,2005,Lin Young, 10/14/2005,Don't buy one,1,"Unquestionably this is the worst GM product in recent history.  Seats are like setting on a wood box, engine destroyed itself at 11,000 miles, ABS/Traction Control did not work for over 8 weeks. The horn button requires over 50 pounds to activate.  It won't pull itself on level road in 4th gear. The seats will not adjust to anyone large or small.  Middle seats are close to front even for a short person.  The rear seat is not adjustable.  We have owned over 25 GM vehicles over the last 30 years, this one is deplorable.  The 1999 Oldsmobile we formerly owned was far superior to the Terraza.  "
buick,terraza,2005,Rich, 12/20/2005,Nice car,5,"This is a very comfortable vehicle for us.  I am pretty big 6'4"" and the front seat is very comfortable.  The second row seats don't have a bunch of leg room behind a tall person but our kids are young so this isn't a problem.  Inside is nice.  The ride is quiet and smooth.   We have not had a problem with the power.  No doubt other vehicles have more but we find the engine adaquate."
buick,terraza,2005,jwh5700, 01/14/2006,Terrazza is worth a look.,4,"The Buick Terraza is definitely worth a look. It may not be as powerful as the Honda Odyssey, but the ride is much better, the fuel economy is also better and has more standard features than its sister the Chevy Uplander. Standard leather seats with cloth inserts and standard electronic load leveling and dynamic styling along with a great price led us to purchase ours in April of 2005. We traveled fully loaded to the max from Cincinnati to Myrtle beach through the mountains and all and had averaged 25 mpg. To date we have not experienced any problems other than a loose panel by the sliding door track and the Buick dealership treats you as if you bought a Mercedes."
buick,terraza,2005,Tom, 01/26/2006,My First Buick Van,4,"I had owned two vans prior to this, both Oldsmobiles, a 2000 and a 2004. I enjoyed both very much. The Terraza I bought is very nice but doesn't seem to have some of the extras that came standard with the Oldsmobiles. For instance the roof racks had crossover bars, in the Terraza you have to buy them extra. I had 3 keyed entrances before (both front doors and the rear hatch), now I only have one, the driver's side door. The Oldsmobiles had little compartments for coins, pencils, etc.  plus small storage bins with lids in the back, there are none in the Terraza, except for the comparment on the rails sys. The Terraza has been in the repair shop 3 times since 1-17-05 and had to be towed once."
buick,terraza,2005,Paul McCauley, 02/09/2006,Love the Terraza!!,4,"I have recently purchased this van and my wife and I LOVE IT!!  I am very confused with the reviews concerning the van not having enough power and wonder what some people expect.  We have driven the van in a mountainous area and never felt the power was inadequate, but then again I did not expect a sports car to haul my family around in. The interior is well laid and loaded with bells and whistles (most of which are easy to understand).  This van rides very nice and has performed wonderfully on several long distance trips. We have averaged 25 mpg on the highway and are ecstatic with these numbers. So far after 8K miles we are very pleased and would highly recommend the Terraza to others."
buick,terraza,2005,RC, 02/20/2006,This van works!,4,"This van works. Buick gives you lots of extras as standard items that you would have to pay more for on the imports. Dont believe consumer reports on the ride quality and noise of the engine, they tested the Saturn version only, not the Buick! Buick differs from the other GM siblings with an independent rear suspension and also quiet tuning and a more refined 3.5L engine. This van is as plush as a Lexus. My wife and I drove 12 hrs in the Van from Oregon to California with a 12 yr old, 8 yr old, new born, mother-in-law and dog in comfort. The kids put the DVD on with headphones and all was quiet. Got to San Jose in great shape!! The Van passed with flying colors."
buick,terraza,2005,Stephen Shorter, 07/15/2006,Pros and Cons to the Terraza,4,"The Terraza rides great, has very comfortable seats, and drives very well.  However, the driver's side sliding door rattles even after three attempts to the dealer to fix it.  I have found the carpeting to be subpar for a Buick.  It is extremely difficult, if not impossible to clean.  I recommend Scotchgarding the carpet on day one.  We owned two Chrysler Town and Country vans prior to the Buick.  I must say the Chryslers were superior to the Buick, although the Buick rides better and has more comfortable seats.  In summary - some aspects of the Terraza we really like and some we don't."
buick,terraza,2005,Brian, 11/28/2006,Interesting Van,4,"We had a few problems when we purchased the vehicle, but GM fixed them all and gave a replacement vehicle to drive.  After all the issues were resolved, there still are a few annoying squeaks coming from the CD/radio panel.  It needs a little more attention to the interior sound detail.  A little disappointing to the Buick line.  Overall, it's been fun to drive. Though the cruise control does not work very well either.  GM is still working on this issue. It carries the family well to get togethers and the DVD player works very good.  It certainly is an upgrade from the Pontiac Montana we drove around.  "
buick,terraza,2005,darin, 03/16/2007,2005 Terreza,2,"Have had bad front brakes at 18,000. Dealer told me that the pads had heat glazed and wanted $290 for new pads. Put new pads on myself. Car still shaking when braking at 25,000 miles. Headlights and dashlights flicker when accelerating. Replaced radio and DVD player once at 10,000 miles. Not happy with it overall"
buick,terraza,2005,lovemyterraza, 07/08/2007,Love my Terraza,4,"I fell in love with this Terraza, but then again I love Buicks. Very comfortable, rides like a dream! Beautiful cherrywood grain interior trim, leather seats, and so much exterior chrome! I love shining things!  Not as roomy as my fullsize conversion vans I owned back in the 80's, but that's when gas was dirt cheap."
buick,terraza,2005,Mark Lamb, 05/24/2007,I'm happy,4,"For a minivan, it's super quiet. Sometimes the only sound is kids laughing in back, enjoying a DVD with the wireless headphones. Performance is adequate, downshifts nicely. Handling is very good for a vehicle of this type. Drives more like a sedan than a van. "
buick,terraza,2005,Deano, 05/25/2007,Mediocrity,3,"We had the Terraza in the shop for the electric doors the second day we owned it. The build quality is less than satisfactory. However, the seats are very comfortable and the ride is smooth. The leather quality is superior on the seats.  Overall, on a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give the Terraza a 6."
buick,terraza,2005,Eric, 08/08/2007,Waste of Money,1,"The Terraza was a great van for the first 6000 miles after that stuff started going wrong with it. The interior is very noisy.  The back hatch rattles. The passenger power sliding door pops open after you close it.  The anti-lock stabilitrak has a warning and service brakes soon message, and the dealer can't find the problem. There is a clunking noise coming from the left front.  I had an Oldsmobile van that this van replaced, I wish the Buick was as nice as the Oldsmobile.  I would not purchase another one. "
buick,terraza,2005,iblocalca, 05/02/2008,Whoa!,3,"I picked this car because I had rented a similar vehicle while on vacation.  I love the extras, and the car itself, but I have had nothing but problems with it.  The stability and the steering system have been ongoing since I bought it.  I was making a lane change at 65 mph on the freeway when the traction, stability went out and the brakes locked and I had no control of the van.  I feel that safety is a big issue and I can't that my car feels safe anymore.  It has been in the shop on and off for the time I have had it.  The dealership has been great fixing these issues but they continue to happen and so I think it is now a dealership issue for me.  "
buick,terraza,2006,terraza, 08/06/2005,Terraza,4,"I have had excellent experience with my new Terraza and would purchase another.  Recently we took the van on a 1200 mile trip through the mountains. The van was completely loaded with a packed luggage carrier on the top, two toddler car seats and 4 adult passengers cooler and suitcases in the back.  We got 22mpg.  We rode in comfort and were fully satisfied.  "
buick,terraza,2006,Jaime, 11/18/2010,Feel Cheated,2,I have put so much money into this van.  Every time I turn around something is broke.  Now I have a sensor going off due to a sliding door.  It doesn't start half the time.  Lights will dim.  I bought it used and the first year and a half I had it it was in the shop almost once a month.  The blind spots are bad.
buick,terraza,2006,tracy , 11/09/2005,Terazza is the best by far,5,"I test drove several mini vans over a period of three months. Terazza, Montana, Senoma, Freestyle, also a van by Saturn. I kept going back to the Terazza it offers everthing that I wanted in a mini van. storage, comfort, style,dvd for the kids.( i have 2)it has a more sporty look to it then mini van. It handles the road great. I recently took it on a road trip to Salem, Mass and it performed wonderful. It was also great on fuel. I think that Buick hit the mark with this minivan."
buick,terraza,2006,christy harroff, 11/13/2015,I LOVE MY TERAZZA !,4,"I bought this used 2 mo ago for $3000.00& I feel it was very well priced .It has all the bells & whistles .My grandson loves the DVD ! I love the interior .I have been wanting a van like this for a long time .Only problem it has is an occasional grinding & vibration coming from maybe a cv joint or something like that when starting out from a partial stop. It is going to garage to get checked out in next few days. Other than that I love my van.

I liked the look features air ride and everything. We have three kids and needed to expand. It caught my eye on a used lot for a week before I looked. I took my family down (after reading aND knowing many electornic issues off the bat. If you have ever owned a Cadillac buick or a gm that has electectronically controlled EVERYTHING knows what I mean, and I am a die hard Gm guy, don't get me wrong so I gave it the benefit of the doubt. Took it for a ride turned out of the dealer  made nasty sound from steering and cv joints
 Which were visibly sealed and OK looking,  I came to the stop li b he and major four way intersection the light wenot green I hit the gas , and the transmission  slipped so bad in first it made the vehicle stall. I subsequently started it back up continued down the road to the next light when the dash lights bEgan dimming and beeping at me. The light went green I hit the gas it s.lipped from first to second then shredded a serpentine belt in traffic was my entire family. I limped back With an 1/8 in of belt width on the pulley parked it and realized every bad thing I heard about the vehicle just happen we do including  the service stability system because the compressor for rear air bags wasn't working. I then looked at a cross over kia rondo  with a third row seat drove ito and bought it the next day it's the best car I've owned. For 2k less than the building know this kind walks all over this buick all day long. WORD OF ADVICE, DO NOT BUY OR EVERYTHING CONSIDER A BUICK TERRAZA or you will have it in the shop once a month with every shop unable to find or fix source of electronic issues. Don't let options fool you. BTW this van only had 79,000 MI on it. LEMON

buick,terraza,2006,foodle, 11/11/2011,'Buick' Another Word for 'Broke',2,"We've only had it a year.
Purchased the extended warranty.
Good thing, it's been in the shop 6 times.
Twice for a draining battery issue that the dealer never did find the answer to.
Battery drained and left us stranded at the airport twice each time after only 5 days.
Battery tested 'good'.
Dealer recommended a new battery anyway since they couldn't find the problem.
Four times
in the shop for electronic doors that chime - drove us nuts - and seldom worked.
Dealer said they couldn't 'duplicate' the problem at the shop but acknowledged we weren't lying.
Transmission started to slip in first.
Only thing to do: we decided to dump it and lose $ on it.
Advice: Stay away."
buick,terraza,2006,aminnj, 01/04/2006,Loaded with Luxury and Amazing features,4,"I have CXL, AWD with all options except Navigation System.  The drive feels like of an SUV & the room you get is of a Minivan's.  Compare to the class leader Odessey this car comes with many extras, such as AWD, Rearview Parking Assisstance, a built- in compressor, AC Power Outlet to charge Camcoders, Digital Cameras, Laptops etc, XM Radio is truly awesome, On-star 1-year free is great feature as well.  If one can afford $199 a year from year 2, it is very useful feature especially if you have a family with kids.  Compare to Honda Odessey, I think the pick up is less and the rear trunk room is superior in Honda. I would suggest to take a look at this Terraza instead of simply going with Honda"
buick,terraza,2006,firstbuick, 10/23/2006,Decide for yourself,4,"I just bought a Buick Terazza CX. Why? Let's start with the design. Nice exterior, elegant interior. Then look at the build quality. It is great! GM has come a long way since the 1997 Pontiac Transport we had. Some hard plastic surfaces to be found, but so what? I don't see molding seams, everything fits well. The dash is solidly put together. Turn signal stalk is silky in operation. Knobs work with quality feel. Other vans may  be benchmarks. Approach these with an open mind.."
buick,terraza,2006,vbf, 07/28/2009,Would buy again,4,"We own the 1998 Pontiac Transport Montana and loved it.  After 160K miles, we felt it was time to retire the Pontaic from daily driving.  We bought the 06' Terraza fully-loaded, used, for a very good price...40% of MSRP when new with only 20K miles.  Have owned the car for 8 months now and put 16K miles on it.  Performs well with AWD on slick/snowy/icy roads, DVD is invaluable for kids and hubs when on long road trips and we can all listen through steareo speaker system.  Also works great driving through construction job sites where I work.  Loud cabin noise needs resolving and cup holder ""platforms"" need eliminating.  They hinder access.  Storage adequate.  Tall theatre seats a hassle."
buick,terraza,2006,Kathy, 10/27/2010,Should have read the Reviews,2," We traded in a Chrysler Town & Country Limited & we loved this vehicle it just had too many miles on it- liking the outside more SUV look of the Buick Terazza I purchased this one with 12,000 miles on it--- Everything I read now in the bad reviews is what I have problem with. Everything rattles- back seats are uncomfortable and cramped- slow to start, stalls. Service stabilation light comes on & steering freezes, clunking in front end dealer says there is nothing wrong with either, the transmission jumps when shifting. The worst is I cannot rely on the fuel gage that tells how many miles till empty- Twice I ran out of gas with 61 miles to go and the low fuel light didn't come on-  "

buick,terraza,2006,Ray, 01/03/2006,Open Road Performance,5,"The Terraza's best feature is the response on the highway.  Took a trip from NY to DC and the car responded beautifully to passing situations.  Accelerating from 55-60mph to 65-70mph to pass, it handled smoothly  and had enough engine power and feel that it could give you more power easily. "
buick,terraza,2006,Dave A, 11/22/2005,06 Buick Terraza Highly Recommended,4,"We've only had this van for about a month now but so far everything has been excellent. Fit and finish and general interior quality is excellent. Radio/CD and DVD Player are excellent easy to operate and sound great, right power door is outstanding, left standard door is very hard to close. Seats are very comfortable and can be adjusted 8 ways. Dual heating controls at front and addnl heating at back are fantastic. We opted for the new 3.9L V6 engine, exc pickup and still better mileage than our previous 03 Rendezvous, will be great for towing if I get that boat next year."
buick,terraza,2006,George, 02/28/2006,Why NOT buy American?,4,"The Terraza by Buick, is a perfect example of an auto that is quiet (quietest I've ever been in), plush, driver friendly, reliable, and has a great deal of thought put into it to please the American driver.  This is truly the finest car I've ever owned (I've owned over 300 cars) right out of the box.  It is the ultimate in versatile.  You can haul a piano, or a family, or your mother in law, or the groceries, and go to dinner or the theater in elegant style.  Auto level control, power everything, towability, and pure comfort style and grace...it has all that and more.  And LOOKS GREAT.  "
buick,terraza,2006,maj, 11/17/2010,disappoinetd,2,"purchased certified used from a gm dealer.  I don't believe carfax or this vehicle was poorly built from the beginning.  I thought I covered all of the basic when first time buying used.  From the noise, lose and squeaky steering wheel, radio can never be turn off manual, feel like the van will fall apart of bumpy roads, purchased a new battery 3 days after purchase, left window squeaks and sitting on pins and needles.       "
buick,terraza,2006,JBundle, 12/10/2008,Sad Buick Showing,2,"While I was growing up, my grandfather always praised how good Buicks were and so I was very biased in my purchase, but no more. I am very disappointed with this van. On the outside it looks like a beautiful vehicle, but on the inside, the engine stalls on cold starts, the vehicle shakes (replaced brakes and tires made it better). There is no room for cargo. My husband is wheelchair bound now and we can either have people or his chair. DVD player also has high pitch noise whenever used. The only things I like are the built in aircompressor and the power door. Other than that the front cupholder broke with the weight of a cup of coffee. I would trade it, but it depreciated as soon as I bought"
buick,terraza,2006,mikeq, 05/02/2010,06 Terrazza with 3.9L V6,3,"Overall I think this is a good van.  It has lots of room, very quite.  Rides nice on highway.  I have had no major problems, However Carl Black Buick performed some warranty work and did a very poor job.  "
buick,terraza,2006,MARY, 06/21/2010,2006 BUICK,2,"2006 Buick Terraza must be one of Buick's worse vehicles, the back seats are not comfortable, only one arm rest per seat, what do you do with your other arm!!?? The Black dashboard makes the vehicle hotter, sometimes I think the air is not working.Makes load noise when turning corners . Head lights and interior lights sometimes dim. I would not buy another Buick."
buick,terraza,2006,hazel, 08/27/2005,Love My terazza!,4,"I love my Terraza. There is not much I would change.  The van is an excellent vehicle for a family in need of a van.  It has the versatility of a van but the look of an SUV, I get many comments about the look of the vehicle.  There are many features on the insided that give lots of comfort while driving it.  Our children love the DVD; and the headphones are great...because we don't have to listen to their movie!  The third row seating has lots of room for feet.  We have even taken it to the drive-ins and put the back seats down to watch the movie.  My husband took one seat out in the middle and sat outside the vehicle to watch the movie -  many people thought that was great! Overall we love it!"
buick,terraza,2006,William, 09/09/2005,Quality Vehicle,5,This is a high quality vehicle.  The styling is great.  The van goes down the road well.  It is driver friendly.  The controls are well within reach.  We had the van out on a 90+ degree day and had to turn the A/C down because we were cold.  That seems impressive for a van.  I would buy another Buick without reservation.
buick,terraza,2006,KTA, 07/06/2006,Don't think I would buy another one,3,"Purchased van with 21,000 miles on it. (Program car). Ride was not as good as our old Pontiac Transport or my Chevrolet pickup. Very bumpy. Had to stop every 1 - 1 1/2 hours because back started to hurt even with adjusting the driver's seat.(No lumbar support). Gas mileage not as good as was told. 21 - 22 MPG on highway. "
buick,terraza,2006,RON, 08/20/2005,Quiet Comfort,4,"Walked through the dealership and noticed that Buick made a van. It caught my eye and the more I looked at it, the more I thought for what was offered at the price it was a bargain. Just an example of the quietness of the vehicle was when it was fully loaded and I could hold a normal conversation.  Now 12,000 miles later I walk out to the parking lot and still utter, yeah!"
buick,terraza,2006,CRR, 10/06/2005,Very Good,4,"I really liked this mini van.  I was surprised at all of the smart features, like the information panel that lets you know exactly how many miles you have before running out of gas and oil, extra cup holders that can be hid away and a censored passenger seat to keep airbag off when a child is under weight.  There were so many common sense things that most vehicles do not have, which makes traveling a lot more comfortable.   The car told you specifically which door was not close. The down side was; you have to shut the side doors real hard to get it to register close.  It took me a while to get used to the truck look on the front end, then I recalled how some men prefer a more masculine look."
buick,terraza,2006,Tim, 10/28/2006,A great minivan for the price,4,"I know Honda, Toyota, and Nissan are all the rage, with Chrysler products leading the American pack, but I have found this Buick Terraza to be a great ride, with all the luxuries of the top guns, and half the price.  I guess because of low consumer ratings, there are great deals for the GM's.  Not sure why ratings are low, but I like these vans.  It is put together well and has a good look, almost SUV-like.  The DVD system with the wireless headphones is great for the kids, and I have found no signs of performance trouble. It's a mini-van for goodness sakes, so I'm not looking for the performance of the cars of my youth.  Want a good van at a good price?  Buy this American made ride."
buick,terraza,2006,Chuck McCarter, 12/29/2006,Great Van!!,4,"My wife and I have 4 young children and this is our first mini van. We looked at the other vans but kept coming back to the Buick and are very pleased with it. We have the CXL with all the options the kids love it. The engine is the 3.9 and my wife and I love the performance, its more than we expected from a mini van. The van is quiet and the longer warranty is proof to me that GM products are as good as any."
buick,terraza,2006,taylor72, 04/25/2007,Don't buy a Terraza - give me my Chrysler,3,"I was impressed by the name Buick and the incentives but after driving it for a few months and comparing it to my previous Dodge Grand Caravan, it isn't as roomy, it's more difficult to get in and out of the back seat, it just isn't as nice inside and there's not as much room behind the 3rd seat. I just want my Chrysler minivan back. "
buick,terraza,2006,G.F. Dicob, 11/21/2006,Dissapointed,2,Very poor interior design. Accelerator pedal is very uncomfortable and places a strain on foot. Seat adjustment for six foot driver is insufficient. Storage space in between front seats is non-existent. With cup holder up unable to get into storage space. Only one power outlet in front area. Unable to use phone charger and GPS at same time. Need hand grip on passenger side to hold onto when entering or exiting. Many other deficiencies but at this time unable to list due to time restraints. Way too much wind and road noise. Extreme amount of rattles. Dealer unable to locate and fix them. Return visits to dealer too frequent to attempt a fix. The CD player had to be removed and sent back.
buick,terraza,2006,sonia, 03/02/2009,Bad Choice,1,"very dissapointed with this van. uncomfortable,noisey,poor performance. problems with stalling,cruise control,abs system,trac stability and control system to say the least."
buick,terraza,2006,tampa-fl, 01/18/2010,Be Afraid...,2,"This was an emergency purchase (with Buick Rendevous trade-in...another GM horror story) for 2008 family summer trips.  DVD system a plus with four kids; averaged 26 MPG highway driving...very comfortable seats.  Lack of seating flexibility (no fold-down 3rd row seats, and 2nd row seats don't slide forward) a major minus.  Removing 2nd/3rd row seats is hernia territory.  Repairs in 18 months ownership: (1) replaced front stabilizer links ($270); (2) reprogram PCM to address extended crank time, Bulletin #05-06-04-076B ($90).  Still fighting Dealer on the flickering headlamps & interior lights, Bulletin #05-06-03-003C, that may require either replacement voltage regulator or alternator (ouch)"
buick,terraza,2006,Calgary Alberta, 06/14/2010,Not a good choice,2,Bought a used 3.9L V6 and I'm very disappointed with this vehicle. I had alarm bells going off all the time with no indication of what was wrong. I finally figured out it had something to do with one of the automatic sliding doors. I also have some sort of inconsistent transmission problem. It either clunks into second gear or it shakes into second gear. Dealer figured out the computer chip needed an update to fix the alarm bells but they can't find anything wrong with the transmission. It's also a very noisy van. Lots of rattling  and road noise.  I've owned lots of different makes of vehicles and will never go back to GM. 
buick,terraza,2006,heatherinraleighnc, 09/27/2005,Like the look - but not the quality...,3,"Traded my Honda Oddessey in for this one because I really wanted a built in DVD and something a more luxurious than what I had and for the price thought it was a good deal. At 5,000 miles the engine stalled out on the highway. Buick ended up having to put a brand new engine in because the previous one wasn't put together properly. After a month I got it back. It drives fine, but every time I start it up it says ""low oil pressure"" on the dash.They can't figure out why - I have taken it in 2 times and they want me to bring it in again to run more tests. Buick did give me a new one to drive while mine was being fixed & gave me 1 month of payments on it for my hassle. Never had any issues w/my Honda."
buick,terraza,2006,Lester Wright, 08/06/2005,Summer Ride,4,Rides very well under all conditions. The feel is more like a large luxury automobile. The comments from other drivers are all very positive to I am going to buy one. I found that on long trips my back did hurt or my body felt tired at all. I would recommend this van to any looking to buy a van.
buick,terraza,2006,Ericzoom, 08/21/2005,Terazza,4,The van rides pretty well and has decent pickup for its size and weight. The brakes feel good with little fade and no shudder.The seats are comfortable and there's lots of room for hauling things.
buick,terraza,2006,DON JOHNSTON, 09/08/2005,My first car at age 65,4,This is the best car I have ever had. My wife always pick the vehicle. I only have one problem and that is getting the little things fixed. We have a cottage in the north. I have run out of gas three times because of a faulty gas gauge. One long trips I tend to get a very severe ache in my right shoulder and we think this is from the A/C unit which has little control other than on /off. 
buick,terraza,2006,rripberger, 12/28/2006,"Good performance, interior lacking",4,"The 3.9 cyl V6 performs great and the vehicle handles nicely. It is a pleasure to drive. Air pump and electric outlet are nice. For the price you would think the interior could be better. There are no fewer than 3 rattles going at any time, road noise over 50mph is too loud. Second row leg room could be better and the second row seats are not designed to be removed (although they can be with a little ingenuity). The Phatnoise multi-media and DVD system are wonderful, however, you cannot control it from the front seat (while you are stopped of course), so for your 3-year-old you have to recline and twist your neck to reach the controls or get out and go to the back."
buick,terraza,2006,Dave, 01/02/2007,06 Terrazza with 3.9L V6,4,"We've had this Terrazza for just about a year now. Other than needing a new transmission in the first 5000km (!) it has been just fine. It is a well built and very comfortable van. We have driven it to Florida and back (22 hours) and it is just great, quiet on the road and the 3.9L V6 is outstanding, great mileage and excellent pick-up. Rear DVD player and wireless headphones are fantastic."
buick,terraza,2006,Eugene J Seifert, 02/07/2007,Vibration or shake,2,This van has had vibration or shake from the first mile. Buick has tried to repair. Replaced tires 3.5 times. This helps but the problem is still there. Buick says this is acceptable and that all the Terraza have it. The van has been in the shop 6 times about 5 weeks total. It has less then 5000 miles on it
buick,terraza,2006,dbrown, 03/19/2007,Poor A/C Performance,3,The overall experience has been pretty good. However the A/C has gone out several times. It will eventually correct itself but does no good on long trips. Even the dealers couldn't figure out what to do.  I would not suggest this vehicle to anyone until Buick gets the A/C figured out.  Very disappointed in this vehicle. 
buick,terraza,2006,Bembie, 10/02/2007,Regretful choice,2,"I have been very disappointed with my Terraza.  The sliding doors are hard to close.  There is no storage between the front seats and I have a hard time finding somewhere to put my purse when my cupholders are open.  There are no air vents in the back and my kids hated this part.  I had to have the rear end replaced at 35,000 miles.  There are also many rattles inside.  Road noise is annoying, too.  I am in the process of trading, even though it is not a good financial move for me.  The depreciation of this vehicle is terrible, but I am willing to go into a new vehicle after being ""upside down"" with this one.  This is my first Buick and I have been disappointed."
buick,terraza,2006,MeMe, 04/15/2008,Very Disappointed,2,"This is the first car I have purchased new, and I am very disappointed with the performance of this van.  My van stalls when starting for day one, was told it is a manufactures problem and can't be fixed.  It has lots of noises from the tires to squeaking in the seats. Bad blind spots in rear Windows because of back head rest. There is very little storage space in back. Had to have sliding door repaired, weather  stripes on doors replaced, new cd player put in, two knew key pads in less than 3 yrs. Rear hatch hard to close, no rear heat, none auto sliding door hard to close, no room betw. Front console and front storage area. This is why they no longer make it."
buick,terraza,2007,NOTIMPRESSED, 09/12/2006,Disappointed with roominess,3,"I have only had this vehicle a few days, I previously drove a 2001 Olds Silhouette for the last 5 years.  I want it back! The Interior of the new vehicle leaves much to be desired. Why mess with something you had almost perfect?  The vehicle's exterior dimensions did not change.  However there is less leg room in the front, very little leg room between 2nd row. The 2nd row seats don't fold back. The sides of the car in the way (shoulder room lost 11 inches in 3rd seat. Why??)  The trunk area lost at least 5 inches in depth as well as height. The worst problem of all is that you can't see out the back window using the rear view mirror. All the headrests are so high there is a very small viewing area. Very dangerous."
buick,terraza,2007,Shaun, 08/29/2008,Thanks for nothing Buick.,2,"I bought this 07 van used in the beginning of 07 with 24k miles on it.  Since then it has been in the shop at least 15 times. One dealer printout of the work done was 14 pages. I contacted Buick about the reliability and safety for that matter of this vehicle which has warranty up to 50k miles mind you, and they (in so many words) said just keep taking it back till its fixed and offered me a year membership to their knock-off AAA.  I am almost more disgusted with Buick then the car itself, they were rude and unaccommodating.  The major repairs included brakes, transmission, wheel bearings, sliding doors, stability sensors, traction control, steering shaft...just to name a few! Do not buy!"
buick,terraza,2007,Thomas, 01/08/2008,"""The All New Lemon"" by Buick",3,"This has to be the 2007 Edsel! Worst new vehicle we've ever owned.  We bought the first one in January, and within a month had so many problems Buick bought it back.  We got this one in April '07.  As of year end '07 it has been in the shop over 150 days.  The sliding doors are a nightmare.  They are especially fun when they won't open or close at all and 5 people have to climb in and out of the rear liftgate.  This is the 6th or 7th Buick auto we've owned over the years.  No amount of money would ever put me in one of these things again though!   "
buick,terraza,2007,Ron, 05/24/2010,It's almost over!,2,"Getting ready to celebrate as are turning this thing in tomorrow off lease. We have disliked this vehicle from the start. It has been in multiple times for power sliding door, air conditioning problems. The heat or air have never seemed to work quite right and the interior just feels cheap. The back seat is a bear to take out and put back in. Also the tires are very worn @ 43k miles. Mechanically the vehicle is fine, it's the problems above that have been annoying. We have owned several Buick's in the past and have been happy with the Buick line until this vehicle."
buick,terraza,2007,Jamie, 04/13/2009,Don't Purchase,1,"Since I have had this one year I have had nothing but issues with the sliding doors.  They get stuck, won't open, or open on their own.  At times it is hard to turn in reverse, it is like I loose power steering. The dealership is NO help.  Hard to see out back.  Hard to get to the back.  Middle seats don't move. Brakes squeak repaired twice. DON'T BUY!!!!!"
buick,terraza,2007,mbenge, 09/15/2006,A Kicked-up Uplander,3,"We used this van for six days while visiting the San Diego and Palm Spring areas in California. We actually had rented a Toyota Sienna that we loved, but at 20,0000 miles it began having brake trouble on the second day. The rental company didn't have anymore Siennas so we went for the Terraza. The controls and display are very well appointed. The DVD player was a huge plus. The van handled well for it is. However, the back passenger seats were uncomfoartable and quite narrow. The road noise was incredidble. Where as in the Sienna four of us could easily carry on a conversation in the Terraza it was a struggle unless we were traveling at 30mph.

buick,terraza,2007,Carwile, 05/20/2007,Don't buy a Terraza,1,We have come to hate this vehicle and after only 8 months are getting rid of it. The seats are uncomfortable  If I adjust the AC on the driver's side to be a little warmer and then want it colder again it blows warm air. Twice the middle on one side has opened without anyone touching it. I had error msgs regarding the brakes and traction control when I turned it on so I called the dealership and they told me what to do to clear the msgs.  When I took it in and they kept it for 3 days they could not find anything wrong for numerous problems and told me there was no error msgs in the computer. The OnStar hands free phone is terrible and difficult to use. This purchase was a waste.

buick,terraza,2007,Zack, 04/23/2019,Biggest turd ive ever purchased,3,"We bought this van used with 60k-ish miles on a whim right before a road trip. At first i was happy with every feature the van had, rear ride-leveler shocks, roof cargo rack, dvd player and moderately comfortable seats. After a few short years the screws started to fall out. The transmission is a pos and needed rebuilt before 80k miles, and now at 110k is starting to slip again. The traction control is horrible, especially in the snow. The rear shock sensor rotted away and was so expensive to replace i ended up eliminating it and went with standard shocks. The sliding rear powered door is super finicky and requires frequent attention, and the non-powered door handle is made of cheap plastic and has broken twice now. While all the rear seats are removable, they are heavy and awkward, and even i, a larger man, struggle to get them out sometimes. Oh and the resale value has absolutely plummeted since we bought it, and i see why. these vans are crap. Save yourself the headache and STAY AWAY!!!

buick,verano,2012,creaseys, 10/11/2014,Nice daily driver,4,"I bought a 2012 Verano base with 11k to drive back and forth to work and I must say I have been very pleased. First, the front seats have tons of room, which is hard to find for someone my size. I am about 6'2'' and weigh 400lbs and I have plenty of room with the only exception being the floorboard area not having much extra space for my feet. 
I have noticed some reviews saying they get poor gas mileage and I con't see how thats possible. I am averaging 29.9 mpg with about 25% city driving and I am what you would call a ""lead footed"" driver. Plus my weight doesn't help gas mileage at all and I have been able to average 32.5 mpg driving on country roads. "

Rides as quiet as a library, holds road tight and looks like mpg beats out what I expected.
Interior is what sold me on this car. Comes with combination of fabric and leatherette ( looks like leather at first) Intellimark Radio with voice recognition is remarkable. Takes a bit to understand all but well worth it.
Fit and finish looks good, 18"" wheels, nice touch for base model.
Only downside was is that seats are manual unless you upgrade to next level.
Exterior looks like a mini Regal which I feel is an elegant car too.
Car based on Cruze platform which I rented but does not come close
GM nice !"
buick,verano,2012,bearsgt53, 05/20/2012,Love my Buicks,4,"I purchased this vehicle little over a month ago.
It is super quiet, great gas mileage and loaded with ammenities.
The only cons that i have for this car is the gas filler neck is located on the right side of the car instead of being on the drivers side, also it only has one 12 volt outlet.
Would loved to have at least two of them. 

 This is my third Buick ( 96 Regal,
2005 Lacrosse and now this Verano). This has to be the quietest buick so far.
I would recommend this vehicle to anyone that loves a quiet and smooth riding car."
buick,verano,2012,iyaoyas, 10/06/2012,Good bang for the buck,4,"I bought my Verano new on Leap Day and have since put over 17K miles on it.
I commute over 100 miles a day, so I think I have a pretty good feel for what this car is all about.
I have used every feature of car and used it a bunch.
I will say that this car has the best seats Buick makes period!
The fit and finish inside is as good as any higher brand and all buttons and controls are well placed.
In over 17K miles I have had zero issues with the car.
I average 30-34 MPG.
For those that complain about a lack of power, not sure what your expecting.
I do a lot of two lane passing and it has never left me wishing I had more power.
This car is hands down the best bang for the buck!"
buick,verano,2012,johnpac, 08/28/2012,Heads up -,3,"I bought my Verano in April, 2012 - I really like the comfort, especially on long drives, and the styling compares with cars several thousands more expensive. However, I would warn you, it is a bit under-powered - not scary weak, but not quite as quick as, say, a Camry. Also, within 2 months I noticed black soot at the tailpipe. It's been looked at twice by the dealer's service mgr, who says he called GM about it, and there is little that can be done because it has to do with valve timing. I don't think this qualifies as a ""LEMON""-type deficiency, but it is a disappointment. If you can live with cleaning the tailpipe every couple weeks, take a hard look at this car. "
buick,verano,2012,superpowers, 04/22/2012,Its Almost too Good to be True,4,"I've been driving my Verano for almost a month.
I immediatley drove down Topanga Cyn Blvd. to Malibu Beach.
If you aren't familiar with the area... It's a windy road that passes through mountain terrain and ends at the California coast. The Verano handled every turn with ease.
I could definitely tell that this vehicle was designed in Europe (from Opel). I was surpised how sturdy and quiet the interior felt through out the ride.


When my friends see the interior, they can't believe its a Buick. The build quality, and the quality of the materials used is probably above most if not all in its class. "

buick,verano,2012,jes421, 03/12/2013,Breaking It In,4,I traded my beloved '08 Saturn Aura XR for a beautifully loaded Verano 1SL about a week ago & I am more than pleased. Today I took her out for a 481 mile daylong road trip that got me 33.3 MPG and that's just the beginning. The smoothness & quietness of the ride alone could take up another column. The 2.4L DOHC has not been lacking in power & has surprisingly proven itself more than capable both in city & on the hwy. This Verano is beautifully built inside & out from the flowing lines & curves of the body to the thoughtful comfort & design of the interior. Buick did this one right. I had originally wanted a LaCrosse & thought that the Verano would be a major step down. I was wrong.

Thought I'd use it as a second car for the price and limited mileage.
Once I got behind the wheel and drove it for a few hundred miles I honestly felt deprived when I got behind the wheel of my Lexus LS 430!
The Verano is quieter, smoother and has more features than cars costing many multiples of its price tag.
Sold my Lexus and am driving the Verano on a daily basis now.
Could not be happier!
Already dreading the day my lease deal ends.
Hopefully Buick will have another offer that comes close to what I currently have so I can stay behind the wheel of a Verano for another couple years..."

We have had 2 oil changes 0 maintenance cost otherwise. We take it in when the oil change indicator goes off. The car is reliable, quiet, and has held up very well. The build quality is one of the best cars I have owned. My wife drives it every day and enjoys every aspect. I would recommended this car to anybody. This is the lowest cost of maintenance vehicle I have ever owned and one of the most well built for the price range possible.

Im very happy with the cars overall performance. Several of my friends have driven this car (all import owners) and they too have come away impressed.

It was get a Toyota or go back to Buick.
I've had two other Buicks in my lifetime.
After researching on Edmunds and test driving I went with the Verano.
So far I have been very pleased.
This is an incredibly nice ride and the options you get for the money paid are amazing.
Now the gas mileage seems average and the back room seat could be bigger, but this really is a lot of luxury for the price and I am happy in the end I got it.
If you are undecided give it a test drive.
Smooth ride and handling, adequate power, lots of bells and whistles put me over the top."

After I bought it, I learned that this is the best selling car in CHINA.
So, GM's built likely a million of these things by now and I think they've got it down.
No problems whatsoever so far, rare for a first year model.
Likes: VERY quiet; smooth autostick tranny; fast enough for any legal driving; GREAT handling (tires on this small car are same size as my former 300C Special); OnStar (they do Everything!); fold down rear seats: comfort/interior appearance.
Best integration of
tech systems of all current Buick models.
Dislikes:
Short legroom reat seats (but OK in a pinch for 4 adults);
 needs full power on both front seats;
cheap looking ext. fender seams."

There was plenty of power on the highway and the ride definitely felt luxurious. I understand that I'm coming from a Vibe, (which is an awesome car, btw) but even so, for just a little more money, I feel like I've moved into a much higher class. I'm excited for Buick with this car. Once the word gets out that the Verano is a great value, I hope people will support it. The one thing I'm nervous about is reliability. I've had zero problems with my Vibe and it has 110,000 miles. If the Verano can come close to that, I'll be happy for Buick, and for me, too. 

Will update."

It's comfortable, very quiet, handles well, has a great Bose sound system, the OnStar Service is excellent, loaded with options, and the car is heavy and very solid!  The original tires lasted 80,000 miles!  Minor complaints are that it gets poor gas mileage for a 4-cyl (may be due to the heavy weight), it had a defective battery after a year (ok since then), black soot discolors the white car around the tailpipe, and it uses a moderate amount of oil.  Would I consider buying it again?  Yes, but Buick has stopped making it.

On the highway from Pittsburgh to Nashville TN, I averaged 35mpg. Fantastic! Those who complain about the power must have never driven other compact offerings. In comparison, this car has a good amount of power. The only things that aren't great about the vehicle are the blind spots and the rear seat room. Great for tall people!

It has the most comfortable ride, it handles like a dream, and for a compact economy car, it's power is not bad at all. When I bought it, it had a little over 52,000 miles and I've put over 20,000 on it. Not a single issue, except for the passenger presence module has gone bad, I guess due to a known pinch in the seat. The car is pretty, inside and out, with a crystal red color on the outside, and a cashmere color on the inside. I have heated leather seats, a heated steering wheel, touch screen, blu-tooth, power seats, the dash has a beautiful blue ambiance, BOSE AUDIO SYSTEM makes music sound AMAZING, plenty of storage and space in the front seats. The back is a little tight but I never use it. The trunk is a pretty good size as well. I've used this car to move two times and it's been such a champ! I get all kinds of compliments. The best part? It holds it's value too. I love this little car!!!

Within the first 1000 miles I started to notice that it was not only relucant to accelerate but struggling by jerking like the transmission is about to drop out of the car. The spoiler has broken off twice now and when I drive over anything but a smooth road the car rebels by sounding like the 96 saturn that I drive to work. To say its a rough ride is an understatement. Also the interior scratches very easy. Everyday
I see new marks and we don't have small children nor any pets that ride in the car. Lastly, the seats are already bubbling up in the center making it look old."

Shame american makers cant get it right. Im buying a foreign car this time. You can look up on google how bad these cars are. DO NOT BUY BUICK!!!!! Update 2/1/17. Still think this is the worst car and buy i ever made. Timing chain went out and destroyed everything around it wen it went bad. Now, transmission needs replaced.

AC went again, even though refrigerant shows pressurized to proper level. Bumper cover started falling off at the point of attachment (fixed myself), and inner insert fell of twice (had to JB weld it). This car is a cash cow for dealerships and mechanics and nightmare for a DIY owner (unless you don't mind buying it at full price at the dealership and just driving it in and getting a loaner vehicle and paying lots of $$$ every time something goes wrong).
Did I mention that even license plate indent is not shaped right? (made for European, skinny plates).
A lemon. After my reliable-as-AK 2001 Buick Verano that I only sold because of severe body panel rust issues and worn-out-to-shreads leather driver seats after 10 years of cold Michigan winters and hot summers, I am bitterly disappointed in Buick products. Probably my last Buick ever.

The red color with cream seats is irresistible and it is very responsive in its steering, with a sporty feel, It's actually fun to drive.  The seats are a combination of leather and fabric in the basic version which I have. Gorgeous!  There are couple of suggestions I'd make  though if  you're considering it: Take a long drive make sure seats are comfortable. I thought at first they were but he middle of the front seat which is fabric sinks down and is very hard compared to the surrounding soft leather. If I had it to do over again I'd get the all leather option. Also the gear shifting at low speeds is very noticeable, even jerky at times.  The instrumentation panel is a bit confusingly laid out, at least for me, though it's gorgeous with an innovative design. The phone system is the exception &  easy to use. In summary, I am still enjoying this car very much.  I recommend  it for those who'd like a small, fun, beautiful car with responsive handling.

buick,verano,2013,lrinnc, 01/24/2014,2013 Verano - nice near-luxury compact (updated),4,"I've had many small to medium sedans, but in 2013 I wanted a domestic near-luxury compact instead of expensive foreign makes or the usual mid-sized choices. The Verano fit the bill perfectly. Tasteful two-tone interior, understated exterior styling, and perfect size for an empty-nester or young professional. The base motor was only average in terms of power and MPG, but the overall goodness of the car for the price stood out. The well-equipped base model was the best value, if you could do without the Convenience or Leather packages. 
2019 update: Enjoyed it until traded in 2018. Extremely reliable, no issues or repairs needed during my ownership (only an airbag switch recall fix). Quiet, smooth running, upscale feel without a high price to buy or own. Nitpicks: no trunk release on trunk lid itself, thick A-pillars on windshield hampered visibility somewhat, electronic steering felt a bit vague and disconnected. Overall, still a nice car! This model is being discontinued, so if you are interested in a mildly upscale small sedan at a great price, now may be a good time to check out dealer's remaining inventory.

This car gives you a lot of content for the money.
I am very pleased after four months of ownership, and highly recommend it.
The only downside I notice is that the base engine (which I have) is underpowered, and the turbo engine increases the price too much.
The ride quality is very good for a car of this size, but not quite up to ""big car"" comfort standards. Wind noise is almost non-existent.
Onstar is very beneficial, and almost, but not quite, replaces the convenience of an in-dash GPS navigation system. The vinyl/cloth seats are excellent."

The car was totaled all the way around it, but the passenger compartment stayed in tact, airbags deployed as they were supposed to and all the exterior safety features did their job so that the most important possession inside the car (my husband) was protected.
We are very impressed with the Verano and cannot say enough about this wonderful car.
So grateful to it and to God for protecting my husband!  
UPDATE - 2017:  We are on our 2nd Verano and still love it!  Only complaint is when the battery dies you cannot open the doors, even with the key put directly into the lock because all the key does is activate the ""power locks"" that have no power when the battery is dead (even Onstar could not unlock the doors).  We had to call roadside service who had to use a slim jim to open the door from the inside just so we could pop the hood and jump start it.  Such a great car and such a huge disappointment that it has this one very dumb flaw.  Just don't leave a light on in your car over the weekend making your battery drain, and you'll be fine.

buick,verano,2013,falkender42, 05/28/2013,Very Nice,3,"IÂve had my Turbo Verano for about two months. ItÂs my first Buick, and itÂs just right for me at this point in my life: right price and right size. It rides well and is quiet, although there is some road/tire noise. I first drove a model with the base engine, which I felt was rather anemic. The turbo is more than adequate for this driver; I actually have to restrain myself a bit when stepping on the gas pedal. Body design is fine, if a bit demure. Interior is very comfortable and well appointed.
Overall, itÂs an very nice car."
buick,verano,2013,Suzanne, 05/01/2016,Unknown Diamond,5,"I LOVE this car!!!! I had been a  three SUV  (Jeep) person since 1991. When it came time to purchase a new car in 2012, I found the Verano by accident. I bought the 2012 Leather edition on the spot and was happy as a clam until the Turbo edition became available in 2013. Maybe it was stupid financially, but I traded the 2012 for the 2013 Luxury edition Turbo. Dumb move financially or not...I'm VERY happy I did. This car is AWESOME! It has every bell and whistle possible, drives like a dream, (quite and suspension) comfortable, good gas mileage, ease of controls, nice looking, etc...I look forward to car drives. Since 2013, the car still looks new. The interior has NO issues. Leather seats show no wear and I am obese! The trims and all are still like new and no little screws or parts have ever come off... very well made! 
To report complaints, it is that the back seat leg room is tight and the headlights don't seem very bright at night.  
THIS IS A SUPER DIAMOND of a car.

buick,verano,2013,jazh, 07/20/2014,2.5 years and still love this car,5,"Never thought I would own a Buick but after test driving midsize after midsize and finding significant issues with each one, I decided to try this car after reading the positive reviews.
After 5 minutes in the turbo, I knew this was going to be the one.
 All of the bells and whistles on a turbo sedan for less than $30K out the door is just a phenomenal deal.
You really have to try hard to find even minor issues on this car.
Limited rear leg room is not an issue for me.

buick,verano,2013,sociallygifted, 08/13/2013,Nice upgrade from previous vehicle,4,"In all I truly enjoy the bells and whistles that Buick has established for my age group 35-40 yr old.
I wanted to support america this go around and decided to purchase from an American car maker.
Who knows the roads better than the soil that the cars are being manufactured.
I'm glad that I've purchased this vehicle!
For the price point compared to other vehicle options, I don't believe that you will be disappointed."
buick,verano,2013,normsky, 08/17/2013,Luxury and sport in a tidy package.,5,"The Verano is a delight to drive with the radio off and the climate control turn down low.
When on the phone using Bluetooth most don't know I am in the car on the highway.
The laminated front glass areas do a great job of eliminating wind noise as most manufacturer wouldn't do. The ride is smooth and quiet yet sporty when you need it.
The steering is very quick to response and it matches the responsiveness of the brakes. Highway fuel economy exceeds EPA estimates even with AC blasting.
The seats are great on long trips as the foam density is about the best I have recently experienced, yet hugging you for a sporty feel.


Update:

We needed automatic transmission and AWD so we traded it for a Cadillac ATS 2.0T.  The Verano was worth what owed on it.  Can't say that much about Cadillac.  But the ATS is a dream to drive it handles so well.

Update ll:

I love the AWD and the styling of the ATS but miss the vault like quiteness and those cushy seats.

buick,verano,2013,dbkfounder, 11/11/2014,"Quiet, nice, comfortable",4,"I have had the Verano for two years now, and have put approximately 30,000 miles.  Never had a single issue.  The MPG is as it is stated in the sticker, get 32 mpg on highway 70 mph.  The exterior design is elegant, quality is excellent.  The seats are very comfortable, and you can't find a quieter car in this size.  If your do a lot of highway driving, and gas & comfort is essential, you can't go wrong with this car."
buick,verano,2013,crunch97, 06/21/2013,2013 Buick Verano - Leather Group - Mocha Bronze,4,"After reaching 240,000 miles on my 2000 Chevy Silverado, I finally decided that I would move on to another car.
I had many vehicles I could choose from, and I really liked my daughters new Chevy Cruze, but after several drives of more than 300 miles, the seats were just not cutting it for me.
After many test drives, and anguish over options, I finally chose the Buick Verano for my daily 32 miles each way trip to work.
It has not dissapoionted as long as I remember to evaluated the car for what it is.
It has plenty of room and easy to drive, while I noticed the some had made comments about the noise, I find that one of the nicest features and get many comments on how quiet the car is."
buick,verano,2013,sclose, 06/08/2014,We STILL LOVE this car!,5,"We purchased a new Verano with the Leather Group package and some additional options including nav.  It has ALL the bells and whistles except the turbo (which I didn't want).  

The base engine (2.4) has sufficient power - the six speed transmission shifts super smoothly - the handling is outstanding - and this is the quietest car we have ever riden in!  The Bose music system is incredible!

The rear seat handles our 6' 2"" grandson but the leg room could be improved. The car gets good all around gas mileage in the mid 20's and really good mileage on the highway (low 30's).  And it's a looker too!  

Ours has the Pearl White paint and we have received many compliments on the car. I really like the waterfall grill and the chrome accents really dresses it up.  Our neighbor assumed it was a BMW.  I told him it was better!  This car is actually FUN to drive!  It is so easy to get around town and to park.  It is a Goldilocks car - not too big, not too small - it's just right. The trunk room is huge.

The only things we would change if we could would be to add a little more rear seat leg room, however, if the front seats are not pushed back all the way, there is enough room. The seats, front and back, are very nice and comfortable.  The front seats are electric except for the back adjustment which is manual. Don't know why they cut that corner.  The front nose of the car could be made about an inch higher to better clear stop bars and curbs.  I know they keep it low on newer cars for aerodynamics and fuel savings but I think a little more height would be appropriate. 

We have really enjoyed this car over the past four years.  We have had NO problems with it in any way!

buick,verano,2013,tazbo, 02/19/2017,"LUXURY, FUNCTIONALITY, QUALITY and STYLE",5,"My Buick Verano has proven to be an exceptional vehicle, both while running daily errands and taking long road trips.  The ride is solid and smooth and acceleration is always there when needed.  The interior design is stylish and all instrumentation and controls are laid out with functionality as a guideline.  Seats are very comfortable, but rear seat leg room is easily decreased, if there are tall front seat passengers.  The trunk can handle a good amount of luggage or cargo, and even more if the rear seats are folded down.  In summing this Buick Verano up... this vehicle has luxury, functionality, quality and style for a reasonable price and it looks so sporty, even when just sitting on the driveway.

After 8 months of loving this Buick Verano, needed to trade it in for a larger SUV to accommodate transporting grandchildren and young nieces and nephews when moved to Florida.  I would still highly recommend the Buick Verano to couples who do not need space for other people.  It was perfect for just my wife and me... but it really can't handle others, with us both being in the 6' height range.

buick,verano,2013,Brent Davis, 02/26/2016,Buick Verano great car,4,"The Buick Verano is one of GM’s more affordable luxury cars with a base price of $20,000. This Buick attracts a lot of younger people that want luxury car features at an affordable price.  The Verano is a sporty car, but also a great family vehicle.  The upgraded package can includes leather heated seats, a 9 speaker Bose audio system, heated steering wheel, electric seats, rear backup camera and a push to start ignition. While the basic package is well-received, the upgrades are worth the extra money. These upgrades can bring the price to over $25,000.
 The 2013 Buick Verano comes with two different engine sizes. The base engine is a 4 cylinder 2.4 L able to produce 180 horsepower at 6,700 RPM’s. For a sportier feel the upgraded engine is a 4 cylinder 2.0 L with a turbo for and extra boost of 250 horsepower at 5,300 RPM’s. With a base engine, I noticed that you barley have to hit the gas for the engine to get up in speed. The Verano only comes with a 6 speed automatic transmission that shifts very smoothly through gears.  Even know you might think the smaller the engine the better gas mileage,  this isn’t true. Buick has put an eco-friendly engine in the Verano. Both models come with a fuel tank capacity size of 15.6 gallons. The fuel economy is rated at 21 miles per gallon in the city and 30 to 32 miles per gallon on the highway. I drive 30 miles round trip 6 days out of the week  and have noticed excellent gas mileage.
 Safety and security features are another great aspect of this car. The Buick Verano includes a driver and passenger airbags. There are also rear side-impact airbags and overhead airbags, for a total of 10, that make passengers feel safe in case of an accident or if the car was to roll over. Other people may wonder if the Verano is secure in weather related conditions.   I would say yes, because it is equipped with traction control, ABS brakes and break assist. The Verano is front wheel drive which helps in snow because the weight of the engine is in the front pushing the tires down to grip the surface.  In a crash test,  the Verano tested 5 out of 5 stars for its excellent safety features. The car also comes with security features such as a panic alarm, 4 door locks and immobilizer which will prevent the wrong key from going in the ignition to keep thieves away from stealing the vehicle.
 Safety, security and high tech features are why I would suggest a Buick Verano to anyone that is looking for a reliable car to get them to point A and B and back. The only con I had with this car is its limited backseat room which is not that big of a problem.  Overall I would rate the 2013 Buick Verano an 8 out of 10 stars.

buick,verano,2013,ohheck, 07/24/2013,Update of 7/13/13 review,3,"A new problem since my review. 3 blocks from my dealer, the Climate Control quit blowing cold air and started pumping out high heat like the heater was on.
I pulled into the dealer, the Service Adviser acknowledged the problem as did the Service Mgr.
The S/A got the cold air working again, so I pulled out of the dealership and the cold air quit again. I returned and the dealer put me in a loaner and said they would call later that day. When they did, the S/A told me that the mechanic couldn't get the Climate Control to fail, so nothing was wrong.
I do not recommend the Verano to anyone and will return to buying foreign as soon as my short term lease is up.
Enough is enough."

buick,verano,2013,ohheck, 07/15/2013,Great but with flaws,4,"Overall, I really like my 2013 Verano Leather Group.
However, it's not all roses.
My main objective was to find a quiet, comfortable car with decent mpg.
The Verano does this well.
However, I have issues that really detract from my driving enjoyment.
They are:
very harsh downshifts from the automatic transmission.
The Bluetooth randomly changes from English to French and loses my Contacts list.
The XM radio changes channels by itself.
I turn off the car with the station tuned to one channel, only to find it tuned to the Preview channel #1 upon restarting the car.
According to the dealer, no trouble found.
I won't return to GM after my 2 year lease is up.

buick,verano,2013,bigbaddave, 03/12/2014,"Chugs along, guzzles gas; a mediocrity",3,"We have now been driving the Verano for three years and my first impressions turned out to be lasting. This is a heavy vehicle with a so-so engine that drinks gas, especially in winter. It still sounds like a lawnmower, and the view out of the back is poor. It's a two-wheel drive car which guarantees poor performance in winter, which is a shame, because we get five months of snow a year. One January day last year three separate sets of neighbors had to push the car down our street after my wife got stuck; an hour later, I navigated the same stretch without problems in my four-wheel drive BMW 328. On the positive side, the cabin heats up very quickly in the cold. My daughter and wife both love the Verano on the grounds that its bulk means they feel safe.

I have contacted Buick and they scheduled for me to go to a Buick dealership to get an estimate. Was told at the dealership that I was not the only one who had brought their vehicle in with this problem. Unfortunately, they told me that it would not be covered and the cost would be $1500-2000.

buick,verano,2013,young professional, 08/29/2016,Reliable Decent Car,4,"Purchased certified pre-owned 2013 Buick Verano with 30K miles on it exactly 2 yrs ago in August 2016 and I am still happy with it for the MOST part. People complain about the grill but I think it looks expensive and unique. My younger brother thought it was a Bentley at first glance. In my opinion, the grills on the Asian cars all look the same. The size of this car makes it easy to maneuver and park. Smooth quiet ride that Buick is known for. However, the acceleration is lackluster. I preferred the 2013 Regal Turbo but I couldn't afford it. The Verano is just fine otherwise, but if you have an extra 3K to spend, get the Regal Turbo.

Mileage is now at 54400 and ive had to change the front driver tire twice in the first yr of ownership. Now in the 2nd yr i have changed all 4 tires. And the fake leather seats on the convenience trim stain really easily. The car died on me in the first year. It was the battery which was replaced. Other than the battery and the tires its been just regular maintenance. I do enjoy the service i receive for scheduled maintenance at the dealership.

The heating is above average, and the air conditioning is adequate after I changed the Config setting to high. The brakes and audio are some of the best features of this car. The gas mileage averages around 25 miles per gallon. The car has been fairly reliable, but there were unusual issues, like the thermostat getting stuck and having to add oil between oil changes.

buick,verano,2014,Vince, 09/27/2016,Be different...,4,"With roads filled with Camrys, Accords, and Fusions, why not take a look at the Buick Verano, a nice entry level luxury sedan.  Built on the same platform as the Chevy Cruze, and that's where the comparison stops.  Buick designed a completely different body and shares few interior parts.   It is conservatively styled and elegant.  When compared in looks to its siblings the Verano fits right in but as a compact.  It has a classy quite interior with comfortable seating.  The rear will be a little cramped for some.  The 2.4 180 HP engine with 6 speed automatic transmission is refined and smooth.  This is the same engine used for the larger base Regal.  I average around 23 MPG, not great but considering the ride and smooth shifting transmission it's no sacrifice.  The cabin environment is very inviting and features 10 airbags.  I have the convenience group in mine, it adds auto night adjusting rear view mirror, partial power drivers seat, lane change warning, frontal collision warning, heated seats, side warning system added to the standard back up camera, all this added to a long list of standard equipment.  There is a pretty user friendly  infotainment system with voice command blue tooth, standard.  The dash has some clutter but glows light blue at night.  18"" alloy wheels are standard.  The Verano feels like a larger car and offers excellent value.  You won't look like everyone else driving one.

Well after having the car nearly three years there is a major paint deteriation issue mostly on the roof and trunk lid.  Others have had this problem too!  The car is out of warranty  but GM has given me a minimal allowance to have a local dealer paint portions of the car.  I am still confronting the dealer for lousy workmanship and a run down battery that they won't addmit to techs negligence. Everything else is peachy!

buick,verano,2014,R.H.Beck, 09/18/2015,Quiet Luxury In A Small Package,5,"I'm used to driving a larger sedan, and was really surprised by the quiet quality ride and handling of this little sedan.  While the natural aspirated 2.4L engine isn't a power house, it has sufficient on-ramp acceleration for merging with freeway traffic without protest.  I would probably opt for the 2.0 turbo engine if buying again;  but I was used to V-8 power prior to this purchase.  I typically get 31-34 mpg running the 75 mph speed limits on the Oklahoma turnpike, and 33-35 on secondary highways at 65 mph.  I live in an urban country setting with mixed driving,  and average about 26.5 mpg locally.  The Bluetooth, voice recognition,  and other infotainment system functions work flawlessly.  I'm 5'11"", and my wife is 5'1"", and the car is very comfortable for both of us to drive.  The interior materials are high quality with good fit and finish.   There's plenty of storage.  The rear seats are very comfortable for adults, and rear leg room is adequate, but not spacious;  and exit and entry to the rear passenger compartment requires a little more effort.  Overall, this car is a pleasure to drive.

buick,verano,2014,Hilton Head Beach, 09/19/2015,My Buick Verano Rocks!!!,5,"This car has awesome build quality. All the panel gaps are perfect the black paint is amazing! I constantly receive compliments. I've owned BMW 7 series, Corvette, Lexus, Miata etc and nothing comes close to the combination of handling, quiet interior, combination of convenience, performance and economy. I love the styling and design. I've taken 2 long trips and the combination of comfortable front seats, 2 zone temperature control, satellite radio, front crash and blind spot warning, a large trunk, getting 32 mpg at 80 mph, and powerful engine all make me very happy.  On last my last trip I hauled a 600# trunk load of books, plus luggage 3,000 miles up and over mountains, around sharp curves, and the car responded beautifully! One of the design choices I enjoy is how the transmission is setup ... when you touch the gas you get immediate acceleration noooo lag and touch the brake the transmission down shifts to help brake the car. It took playing with the electric drivers seat settings to keep my thighs from getting pinched and sore. It took awhile to get used to a blind spot caused by the passenger side windshield/roof pillar. Update 9/30/16 ... The quality of this car continues to amaze me so far nothing but oil changes!

I wanted to get the Lacross just because I like a car with extra space but I find this car just a luxurious and just a comfortable as the Lacross.  It's packed with safety features and for being a compact car, it rides and feels like a full-size car.  If you love Buicks, this car will meet if not exceed your expectations.

It does have the features that I wanted.  It is difficult for me to get into and to get out of, but then, I am overweight and no longer young.  It drives nicely.  It has a lot of pep for a four-banger.  I can read the instruments, and I really like the entertainment system.  It looks good, without all the angles that so many newer cars seem to have.  The grill is at least chrome plated plastic, which is much nicer than black.  The wheels look good, and the suspension is great.  I'm looking forward to my first road trip.  *From 1989's album, ""Nick of Time,"" the single ""Too Soon To Tell.""

buick,verano,2015,Jfinch, 10/21/2015,I love my baby Buick!,5,"I went into the dealership planning on buying an impala. Unfortunately I couldn't really justify to myself why I needed that large of a car. So they showed me this Buick and I fell in love! Truthfully at first I didn't think I was going to fit in it. I'm 6'4 so I get very skeptical over vehicle size. I pushed the seat all the way back and was shocked! I couldn't touch the pedals! So on with the test drive. I was averaging 40mpg on the test drive and I was ready to sign the papers before we got back! Now, I've owned the car for 3 months now and I've put 12,300 miles on it so let me tell you what it's like living with it. I took it on a trip (360 mile round trip) and I only used 8.5 gallons. That's 42 mpg! And it was so comfortable and quiet! The interior is holding up well, however if you have the black and gray interior, expect some frustration. Anything on the black materials you touch with turn white. It's like some sort of chemical reaction happens and suddenly you have white spots everywhere. Make sure you don't have an older style iPhone (I have a 4s with THOUSANDS OF PICTURES) as plugging it in will freeze your radio, causing it to stick where it is for about 10 minutes before restarting just fine. Not a big deal, it just gets annoying because you'll never know when it's going to happen. The back seat is just about unusable. Really. Unless you have someone up front who is willing to compromise on a little leg room, it's really too tight back there. I really don't know how the engineers didn't notice this. Once I meet someone with three inch thick legs, maybe I'll understand. You cannot get fast food and expect both the driver and passenger to get soft drinks as they both won't fit into the cup holder at once. This is a pain too. They can, but it's just in the way and they have to be at an awkward angle. Lighted glovebox is something I haven't seen on a car in 20 years, and it's very nice. The car is quick, although it doesn't feel like it. It will get you into trouble because you'll think you're doing 60 when you're really doing 90. But all in all I really do love this car. It's comfortable, economical, powerful, smooth, beautiful (especially in the dark gray I have) and just all around nice! Also I got $7,000 off on the price which swayed my decision a little bit too.

buick,verano,2015,GregR, 08/05/2015,"Very quiet, a surprisingly good ride & value",5,"Just under 60,000 miles and we just replaced the original Continental ContiPro tires and in for first alignment. Each time wore evenly and the ride is back to what it was when it was new. Good tires make one heck of a difference. Mileage remains consistent with 33MPG highway and 30+ combo city and driveway. As it's a direct injection engine it's time for a intake valve cleaning, and we'll schedule this next. Interior, paint, and trim holding up well. OEM battery replaced with an AGM battery and it held up well too. No complaints, reliable transportation, easy to maintain, looks good, and mileage remains good. Amazing the value and deal this car is for what it was sold for. People missed a great buy and GM killed off (in the US anyway) a reliable car. 

Now 50,000 miles and this car has not been in for a single warranty claim. I have owned Chrysler, Jeep, Chevy, Honda, and Acura and every vehicle had at least one warranty service visit. Except my Verano. Very impressed. 

Mileage remains good, just had the transmission fluid serviced and car shifts like its brand new. Still comfy and enjoying the car. This a sleeper car that really shines. 

6,500 on the odometer now and I have to comment how impressed I am with this car. We would have never bought a Buick, but after riding in one, before you buy something else you need to take this for a ride. Easy to get in and out of, comfortable seats, large trunk, lifetime 30MPG per the OnStar app, no issues at all, well laid out interior, nice fit and finish, and the engine and transmission work well together. We have the Leather group and the keyless ignition is awesome. This car is loaded with safety features, and when you compare to other models, and the price, you can no go wrong. Lane assist, forward facing camera, all the airbags, blind spot monitoring, self-dim rear mirror - all for an affordable price. I drive an Acura, a Jeep, Honda Civic, and another GM product, and this car is THE quietest of all of them. Reliability we'll wait and see, but so far not a single warranty claim. We're in for our first oil change in about 2 weeks, complements of Buick. 

Someone posted there is no back seat room. I'm 6'4"" and I don't need the front seat all the way back to be comfortable, and yes, someone can still sit behind me when I'm driving. Sure, I can push the seat all the way back, but it's not needed. This is no large 4-door sedan, so for the size car we're talking about, the interior room is impressive.

Don't pass this model up. You will be surprised as we were. (Exterior color is the upgraded White Pearl, with two-tone brown interior).

In my lifetime I have owned about 20 cars. This by far is my best. I loved my old cameo's and my Lincolns the best was the MarkVII, But being in this car is fantastic, My last 4 cars were Lincolns but this is better then those. I have the premium model, plenty of head room even with the sunroof, the electronics are plentiful, and the ride QUIET. I admit the back is a little tight, but I don't have to many trips with a back seat person.  .I looked at the Audi , I looked at Honda, but I feel for this one the minute i got behind the wheel. With an outstanding warranty and a dealer who really looks after you.. I will be happy with this car for years to come.

A year later, I still like this car. The ride is quit, and handles beautifully.

buick,verano,2015,KKing, 09/21/2018,I Brought A Brand New Lemon,2,"I brought my car from Faulkner Buick in 2015 brand new. These last 3 years were great I had zero complaints except I wished it went faster on take off. Well this past summer starting in May I have had nothing but major problems from this car. Yes I do have high mileage (130000) but I have another car at my home with more miles and I have NEVER had major issues out of that car. Now this Buick is driving me insane!! First I needed a catalytic converter, that was about $5-600, then I needed a camshaft; a belt and timing sensor(I don't know the exact name of these last 2) this was all about $6-700. I get the camshaft+belt+timing thing replaced and pick my car up on a Tuesday in July by Thursday of that same week my car completely stops moving on me while I was on the road. With zero warning the car stopped on me mid drive. I had it towed back to Faulkner where a day later they told me the check engine light was for the transmission.  I don't know of any car quitting on someone like this and having a transmission issue. I now am trying to have the transmission replaced but I have been waiting due to the transmissions being on back order. Someone at the dealership said buick was remodeling the transmissions for this particular car (I cant remember the exact word she used) but to me it seems as if this car should have a recall if people are having transmissions just quit on them like this. Yes I have heard of others with this same car having a similar issue. So in a nutshell this car will eventually need a new trans, save your money do not buy this vehicle. You may want to skip buick all together. Due to my high mileage I can't get a coupon or discount on the service nor can I get a courtesy vehicle to use(they claim to not have any although I saw one yesterday) so I'm just stuck with a $3000 bill and no way to get from A to B. Its so sad because I really loved my car but now I currently I have no car, I wished I listened and brought a foreign car :(

Update: I keep having random expensive issues the latest has been the blower needing to be replaced. Cost about 800. Its now 5 years old. I've put alot of money into the car because I'm on payments. It will be paid off next year, thank goodness. I can stack those payments for any future repairs I may need. I don't want another buick after all the money I spent. I really was hoping to upgrade to an Enclave but I'm scared as hell that I'll end up in the same situation. Everyone i talk to about my car they have never had such major problems so early in a cars life. So I've come to the conclusion I just have a badly built model. I love my cheap luxury car I wish it would stop breaking down on me but I know it's not. In fact I have to get the gear shift replaced. Its been telling me to put it in park(although I'll be parked), the button I push inorder to move the stick has fallen out. So thats my next expensive project. Wish my pockets luck that I can afford this replacement. 
"
buick,verano,2015,David Smith, 02/28/2016,2015 Verano,4,I am pleased with the performance of my Verano but have discovered an annoying sound that the dealer says is normal operation. Every time I open a car door a sound is activated. I've been told this is the emergency brake activator. I find it hard to believe this is normal and would like anyone else's comments if you've had a similar occurrence.
buick,verano,2015,standonit, 03/24/2015,Not worth it,3,"I have been driving this Verano for 3 weeks. Thankfully, it is a company car. I would never buy it.
Do not try to put adults in the rear seats. There is not enough leg room. The trunk lid does not open enough. I have to bend way over to keep from hitting my head on the trunk lid...OUCH!
When I adjust the steering to a comfortable level, it blocks out the temperature and fuel gauge, and the top of the speedometer. 
Finally, this car likes fuel for a 4cyl engine. I am averaging 26-27mpg over a combination of interstate and rural US highways. Again, thankfully, this is a company car.

Update:
Buick no longer offers this vehicle. Thankfully!

buick,verano,2015,Jim Brewer, 06/28/2016,Verano replaces aging Lacrosse,4,"Some things are not known, for instance I have not driven this car at night yet. I don't know about the lighting. I have not enrolled in the trial Onstar or XM Radio yet either. For local travel these are low priority. Dealer support is unknown as car was bought at Subaru dealer, and I don't know if I will service it there. It is a long way from our home and there are other qualified dealers (Chevy, Buick and Hyundai) closer. I have used only two of these for previous Buick service. Car has been fine to drive on road and in town. I am satisfied with car so far. I don't think there are not enough categories in this survey. I was very satisfied with dealership where car was purchased. Since I am updating this,  my satisfaction with this car has declined due to  interior panel rattling at the sunroof. I need to get this back to a dealer for warranty work; I hope they can resolve this issue.

Accidentally set off the alarm and was notified by them of it and what my options were (a mistake or if needed to be reported).

buick,verano,2016,Marc R, 09/07/2016,Would Highly Recommend,5,"I went from a 2014 GMC SUV to the Buick Verano.  I wasn't even interested in looking at a Buick when my dealership asked me if I was interested in Buick.  They took me out to the Verano and I was impressed with the way that the exterior looked.  I have to say that it is a sleek looking vehicle and it looks like a luxury sedan, without the luxury price.  I then sat inside, and I have to say my first thought was WOW, Buick did a really good job.  Now after driving it for a month, I have to say that the ride is pleasurable, it's quiet, the entertainment features are great, and the car is a joy to drive.  It's considered a compact car however I feel like I'm driving in a full size sedan.  I just don't feel like the car is that small.  The interior design and layout is of great comfort and looks very classy.  Everyone that has been inside my car says, wow this is nice.  Buick really did a great job making this sedan look like a luxury vehicle.  My girlfriend jokes with me that I bought a luxury vehicle.  The car handles well and I do a lot of city driving and with the help of cruise control when I can use it, I'm getting 27 miles to the gallon in the city.  So you can stretch the MPG if you drive sensibly.  Overall I have to say that I am happy to be in this vehicle.  It certainly feels different than driving an SUV, but I was ready for a switch and am enjoying Buicks Verano.
"
buick,verano,2016,Mike S., 07/01/2017,Solid Car,4,"I bought my new 2016 Buick Verano in May, and after about 1,200 miles, the car is solid, quiet, and very comfortable. While it isn't super quick or powerful, the 2.4 base engine is more than adequate for passing and maneuvering in city and highway driving, especially for commuting. The gas mileage is pretty good as well -- about mid 20s overall. The ride and handling are surprisingly composed and even nimble at times. While not a sports sedan, the car has precise steering that feels very well matched to its transmission, making it fun to drive despite its weight. As for the interior, I find the driver's seat to be comfortable and supportive, with good bolstering, and the soft-touch materials and aqua lighting are elegant. To me, the only real downsides are the number of controls on the dash (they're pretty logical after a while), the side window sills (which affect frontal visibility somewhat), and the small back seat (which is not an issue for me and is offset by the spacious trunk). Update: After 4,500 miles, the car remains solid, reliable, and very practical. The only service needed so far was an oil change. Overall, the Verano is a very good value for the money. Second Update after 7,500 miles and 14 months of ownership: The car remains solid, reliable, and very practical. The parking assistance features have been very useful when backing into spots.
"
buick,verano,2016,Lou Refano, 06/13/2017,Very Comfortable and Stylish Small Buick,4,"I am very pleased with my Verano.  I always wanted to step up to a new Buick, and my Sport Touring does not disappoint.  The car gives the driver a smooth, comfortable, roomy, solid feel.  I just love driving it.  The 2.4 L 4-cylinder could use a little more pickup, but it's more than adequate for Long Island highways.  I have also gotten a lot of compliments on the styling of the car. 
I particularly like the Buick design cues, such as the chrome ventiports on the hood and the five-spoke rims. The only major complaint I have is the infotainment system in the center stack...it's a bit convoluted, and not as intuitive as it could be.  It took about a month before I was really comfortable using the radio and navigation.  But once you get the hang of it, it becomes quite easy.  I sat in a new Buick Cascada and the center stack was quite simplified in comparison.  The back seat can be a little tight for some, although you get a big trunk in this car.  All in all, if you want luxurious comfort and a smooth, controlled ride in a compact package, especially at the end of a long work day in rush hour traffic, you can't go wrong with the Verano sedan.

After 3 years of ownership, I know I made the right choice.  No major mechanical issues, paint quality is outstanding, and it drives very comfortably and delivers 35 mpg on the highway.  A reliable, stylish small Buick that I heartily recommend!
"
buick,verano,2016,WizKid D, 02/24/2018,Best value for the money in 2016 for a salesman.,5,"I drive this car about 550 miles per week for work as a route salesperson. It is also my personal weekend car as well. It is extremely comfortable and very competent on the road. I do all scheduled maintenance as recommended by the manufacturer. I currently have over 37k miles on it and not a single issue of any kind. I absolutely love this car and I'm glad I chose this over the others that I drove. I feel that for the price I paid I received an excellent value. My only irritation is that on occasion, the car cannot figure out what I am telling it on the in-car voice-controlled entertainment system. I'll ask it to tune XM CNN and it will say tuning XM 47. I'll ask it to play song title Jack and Dianne, and it will say playing I'm the man. A bit more work on voice recognition would have been nice, but it's not a big deal. It usually gives me a laugh when it makes some crazy, not even close, mistakes. I purchased a separate set of rims and tires for winter. This car NEEDS to have winter tires in New England. I wouldn't drive it on all seasons, especially with my territory. I will definitely look at Buick again when I get another car in three years. In my opinion, this is an excellent brand and a great model of vehicle. I feel safe, comfortable, and proud to be driving my Verano.
"
buick,verano,2016,Neward Thelman, 05/04/2016,Among The Best In It's Class,4,"The Verano is based off the same GM platform as the Chevy Cruze Limited, yet it feels like a completely different car. Driving it you feel greater power right off the bat. No, it's not sports-car-Camaro power, but I disagree with the Edmunds review that acceleration's merely adequate. The Verano feels more powerful than either the Cruze Limited or the new Cruze for 2016, possibly because the entire car feel much more solid, thus dissipating less energy in parasitic vibrations. The Verano gives you a sure, solid feeling on the road. An important contributor toward that end is the stark difference in streering and handling between any of the Cruze models and the Verano. The short of it is that the Cruze - particularly the newly redesigned 2016 Cruze - feels incredibly insecure and unstable during fast accelaration or highway speeds, while the Verano is almost the opposite of that. It's steering and handling feel stable and secure, with only a mere trace of lost of control to clue you into the fact that it's built with electronic - rather than traditional mechanical - steering. To take the point further, compared to any of the [now many] Cruzes, the Verano is rock solid. With the handling nicely under control, the suspension provides and excellent combination of road feel balanced against absorbtive comformt. In other words, it handles beautifully, without turning you into scrambled eggs while doing so. The interior is, as you'd expect, at or near luxury car levels. It's quiet and plush. Some might object to the two-tone white-on-black color scheme [Buick calls the interior grey - but it's pretty much white], but that seems to be the thing with luxury cars. 

The designers of the Verano did, however, make one major mistake. The steering wheel blocks your view of the instrument gauge cluster. No matter how far you tilt it up or down, you're just not going to see the speedometer, nor much else of your guages. Having taken such apparent care with the design of the car, how'd they screw that up? Good luck with speed cops on the road.

A more minor issue's one of personal taste. I found the front grill to be almost aggresively tasteless, with Buick taking its vertical design a bit too far. The grill extends upwards and folds into the hood, and it's made of plastic. So, you get a lot of plastic grill in your face everytime you approach your car. 

Overall, I thought the Verano was very nice small vehicle, that - at least as far as driving impressions go - leaves it's stablemate Cruze well behind and makes the Corolla and the 2016 Civic almost non-competative [especially the almost shockingly crude, cheap-feeling, and sounding Corolla]. The other question is, of course, reliability, and it's only on that measure that the latter two may [or may not - who knows?] have an edge.

buick,verano,2016,Dan P., 01/11/2018,2016 Buick Verano Premium Turbo,5,"The Buick Verano is a terrific value for your money.  I have the 2.0 Liter Turbo and the performance is outstanding.  This car rides very smooth, it is stylish and the gas mileage is good.  Buick has always been known for a comfortable ride but the Verano turbo is a fun drive, quick acceleration and eye catching.  The Premium Turbo model has virtually all that you need in a car.  It is dynamic and a GREAT car for the money.  It is sporty and drives better than my prior car, an Infinity G37.  All I can say is give this car a try if you want a luxury sedan at a terrific value.

The rear window is small and there are some blind spots when it comes to vision. A beauty of a car, still trying to get used to the extra shifting of the 6-speed transmission which sometimes feels a little jerky when trying to set cruise control for a speed that is in between gears.

It has been a great driver: fast, comfortable, competent handling, quiet and reliable.  The only issues I can fault are the confusing instrumentation/dashboard controls and the mediocre gas mileage, (requires premium fuel). Other than that, this is the most enjoyable American car I have had the privilege to own in decades. Everyone who has ridden in the car has compared it favorably to MUCH more expensive European sport sedans.  If you are a driving enthusiast and can find a well-kept used example with the slick shifting automatic, (I hear the manual transmission isn't very good) don't hesitate to BUY IT and enjoy!"

buick,verano,2017,Dennis Newcomer, 03/01/2019,Anyone Who Buys A GM Product Beware,1,"My wife urged me to consider GM products again since she came from a GM family.  As an experiment over 5 years, we purchased 3 GM products.  All have significant issues, but this Buick Verano is the worse.  For starters, almost all GM engines these days consume oil regardless of maintenance.  Being an engineer, this Verano has seen nothing  but DEXOs oil from mile 1 and still the engine consumes oil.  Now at 82,000 miles uses 2 Qts every 3,000 miles.  Based on a quick internet search is seems this is common and when GM does finally issue special coverage warranty, they seem to only 5% of affected cars or issue it covering low miles to keep the Class Action lawsuits at bay.   The engine is just one of many issues with this vehicle all which are expensive to repair.  If i had a GM dealer fix all of the manufacturing defects that I, and most other owners, have had the repair costs would exceed over $12, 000.  Malibu has similar problems and lack of GM response, just not as bad.   BOTTOM LINE:  Our experiment is over and we will never purchase an GM product.  The Honda (188,000 miles) and Toyota (167,987 miles) now over 10 years old have not had a single repair beyond oil and brakes.  I would take these cars on a trip rather than our 2015 Malibu.  Ignore what the Car magazines and websites say. GM has influence over them.  When it comes to GM products, just hold on to your checkbook and walk the other direction quickly.  Trust me you will thank me some day.

buick,verano,2017,Emily, 11/07/2018,My first Buick,4,"Recently bought a used 2017 Sport Touring. Very comfortable and quiet. Adequate power from the 4 cylinder, no problem merging or overtaking. Great value compared to the German or Japanese equivalents. Interior is much better than I ever expected from a GM product.  Still lots of warranty left! No regrets so far."

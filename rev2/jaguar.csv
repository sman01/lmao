jaguar,e-pace,2018,Hk_650, 08/01/2018,2018 Jaguar E pace,3,"Bought this car because the Volvo XC40 I wanted to order was so far out on production. I thought this would be a good alternative despite being almost $10,000 more. However, the tech is extremely lacking, the interior is simple but my Chevy Cruze rs is just as nice. So no big points there. Also, the car has less then 2,000mi and been in the shop twice with transmission issues kicking it out of gear while driving down the road and not allowing you to select a gear, Essentially leaving you straded. Oh, and when I was asked to review from Jaguar they took down my review. So be quite weary if you decide to purchase this car.

jaguar,e-pace,2018,G.T. in SoCal, 10/17/2018,Do Not Buy This Vehicle...Safety Defects Galore!,1,"After reading so many positive reviews, my E-Pace may be a lemon!  The engine suddenly loses power (has happened to me twice, once in a 55mph zone and the second time on a 5 lane freeway!), the check engine light illuminates and the E-Pace goes into a ""limp home"" mode.  Jaguar is well aware of this defect and has just rolled out a ""software patch"" to supposedly fix this issue.  Too little, too late.  I was almost rear ended by a semi when this first happened!  My E-Pace went in for the patch on 9/28/18, and whatever they did to ""fix"" the problem has affected the start/stop function.  It remains on 80% of the time.  This affects the mpg of the vehicle and should raise the eyebrow of the EPA.  Additionally, the engine and the transmission are poorly synched.  Once I place the E-Pace in drive or reverse it takes 1-2 seconds for the vehicle to move, and when it does, it leaps.  The entertainment system lacks Apple or Android connectivity, the speedometer is far too small, voice recognition is horrible...I could go on and on, but to top it all off, Jaguar's Customer Relations is a joke!  Do Not Buy This Vehicle!

jaguar,e-pace,2018,Lance Bowling, 08/10/2018,Best Compact SUV by a mile; but could be better,4,"Pros: Best looking, best handling in class and fun to drive. Stunning looks & style for a SUV, well laid out & comfortable sporty cockpit (F Type copy), good driver visibility, brilliant performance technology, great features, smooth shifting nine-speed transmission, quite nimble, precise steering, super stable braking, great cornering & windy conditions stability, excellent surround camera system, brilliant adaptive cruise control, unbelievable self parking, very good sound system, good interior fit and finish, and great storage capability considering vehicle size. 
Cons: Little expensive, feathery overly sensitive accelerator (spurts), 1 second transmission kick down delay, washed out touchscreen display, windshield blocks radio frequencies, and a few other minor issues listed under, ‚ÄúDetails of Issues‚Äù.
Overall: A vehicle well suited to city driving and equally at home in the country; but not my first choice for long distance trips (full-size SUV time). The vehicle is best suited to a family of four or less (children and smaller bodies in the rear). The 21 inch wheels provide a great ride in ‚ÄúComfort‚Äù & ‚ÄúDynamic‚Äù modes, better than the smaller offerings. Brakes are excellent and feel stable under hard braking. Has ‚ÄúECO‚Äù mode to improve fuel consumption. 6 -different models and a plethora of options to suit most needs. Has all the latest safety features and collision avoidance. Top model could do with a more powerful motor. It is miles better than the competition.
5 out of 5 if it wasn‚Äôt for the metalized windshield, display washout, spurty throttle and transmission delay. 
Bottom Line: If you want the best looking, best handling compact SUV in the world, your search stops here.
Details of Issues (nothing major)
Expensive
Has better performance technology than the competition which costs a little more; but even so, still seems a bit pricey.
Windshield Blocks Radio Frequencies
I really dislike the  metalized windshield which blocks radio frequencies. Toll Tag clear patch is too small. Range of wireless devices is reduced (up to 95%), including; door and gate openers, phones, RFID, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, radar detectors and medical alert.
Feather Light and Overly Sensitive Throttle Pedal
Almost no foot feel and too sensitive. A bumpy road, a sharp corner or just acceleration forces can cause unwanted acceleration spurts (jerking). Also, you have to hold your foot up all the time when just cruising. It feels unnatural and a little uncomfortable. Thank goodness for the excellent adaptive cruise control. 
Transmission downshift delay
Foot to floorboards and wait 1+ seconds for significant acceleration. 
Touchscreen Washout
The touchscreen difficult to see in bright daylight and is barely visible in bright sunny conditions. 
The problem is that the display sits angled almost flat well ahead of the roofline and there is no sunshade, so the sun shines right on it. Accentuated by no high contrast color scheme option, just ‚ÄúLight‚Äù (light pastel) or ‚ÄúDark‚Äù. It‚Äôs fine at night or on dreary days.
Windshield Reduces Night Vision
The windshield is metalized to block UV rays which it does well. It also cuts down visible light reducing normal vision just like sunglasses or regular window tint does. The problem is that it also reduces vision at night too when you need maximum clarity. 
Road Noise
Road (tire) noise is noticeable and could benefit from improved floor and wheel arch insulation.
Automatic Relocking & Arming
Only the dealership can turn it on or off. I can see the reason for automatic locking and arming in high crime areas. In the country, the automatic system is annoying and inconvenient. There should be an easy way to turn the feature on and off.
Door Locked Condition Indicator
No visible external indicator that the doors are locked (except the folding door mirrors). In a noisy bright light situation, it‚Äôs difficult to see (light
 flash) or hear the doors lock. 
Automatic Power Fold Door Mirrors
Useful option, but it can only be turned on and off by the dealership? 
Keyless Door Locking
Keyless locking is overly complicated and imprecise (Unlocking is great). The manual goes into detail not to grab the door handle while touching the lock sensor. In reality, it is only necessary to be lightly touching the handle for the sensor not to work; or if your finger touches a little outside of the sensor area. One could turn on the auto locking full time, but that causes other irritating convenience issues.
Restricted Driver‚Äôs Foot Well
No good place to put your left foot if you have long legs. Wheel well intrudes into this space.
Reflections from Bright Shiny Bezels
Reflections in driver‚Äôs side mirror from bright shiny driver‚Äôs side air vent bezel. Reflections from bright shiny bezels (air vents and display) on front windshield.
Driver‚Äôs Maximum Seat Height
The front dash and side windows sills are quite high. I found that with the seat all the way up, I still felt like I was sitting a bit too low (1 inch).

jaguar,e-pace,2018,Tony, 11/22/2019,big disappointment!,1,"Bought this car without reading reviews due to its captivating looks. Engine fan sound is like a moulinex juicer, seats are starting to wrinkle (leather) transmission replaced already, gear kicks on acceleration and deceleration better than roberto carlos and air conditioning fan changes speed on its own! All that topped with bad customer service and incompetent mechanics that don‚Äôt know how to fix the problems...you can imagine how it is like!"
jaguar,e-pace,2018,Kelly Smith, 11/09/2018,Not worth the money,2,"My local Jaguar Land Rover dealership is working on my 2012 Land Rover LR4 and they dumped this tiny turkey on me for a loaner for about 5 days. I really don't like it at all. I don't think it looks anything like a Jaguar, it reminds me of a small Ford Taurus, I think those were called a Ford Concave.  Of course the looks really don't matter to me as it is only a loaner at this point.  What I don't like is the ride, I feel like I'm in a chuck-wagon going on an expedition across the prairie, what with all the jerking and vibration that goes on just to drive at a steady clip of 40mph.  Hold on to your bonnet if you are stalled/stopped at a light and need to re-ignite the engine as it will jerk you into action.  The interior is nothing to write home about, in fact it is rather dull.  There is a lot of unnecessary hoopla that will drive up the price of this ordinary small vehicle such as the lights that show a circle and jaguar when you open the door at night, the nice but really overblown electronics - I'm a 57 year old woman and enjoy driving a car, not a computer - and the inane way you have to hold the gear a certain way and move it forward to go in reverse and move it backwards to go forward - why complicate what should be an enjoyable experience. I want to drive and enjoy it, not feel like I'm in the computer lab and have to figure out a coding program to get the car to work.  I'm 5'10"" tall and occasionally I bang my head trying to get into the drivers seat.  I can't wait to get my big, 2012, LR4 back, it will feel like I left the small hardwood chair for a couch.

jaguar,e-pace,2018,MinnesotaNiceMom, 07/09/2018,Love this Jaguar!,5,"Very sharp looking - I get compliments all of the time on my car. (My Husband‚Äôs BMW X5 doesn‚Äôt ever get any!) I love the way it drives. Only complaint is the subwoofer shakes my car and makes the doors rattle. üò¢ And the back seat is very small!
"
jaguar,e-pace,2018,Robert AC, 11/09/2018,Love the Jaguar E-Pace,5,"I have only leased this car for a short period of time, however, so far no problems at all. It is fun to drive, and even with the smaller horsepower turbo engine there is so much pickup even from an initial start. Plenty of power merging into highway traffic. I am driving the S trim with lots of added options. Adaptive Cruise control works very well. Leather seats are very comfortable. Lots of standard options even on the S trim, but recommend upgrading to the Meridian sound system. My model has park assist, however, it is a bit more difficult to adapt to than the park assist I had on my previously owned Mercedes. Enough room in the back seats for 2 adults even when the front seats are pushed back a bit. The storage space is smaller than my wife's Audi Q5, but with the back seats down plenty of room to go shopping at Cosco and spend my usual $350 for more stuff than I need! The interior trim is not as fancy as some other luxury SUV's, but the reason to buy this car is the way it handles - especially steering and acceleration. The warranty and service maintenance is for 5 years or 50,000 miles and is included with the price of the car. The one option for this car is a fixed glass roof with sunshade, but I generally have never opened the roof even on cars I have owned that had that functionality. I test drove several other SUV models before deciding on the E-Pace, but this one sold me because of the way it drove and the number of standard options included which are usually extra on other models. Also, the current lease deals are virtually at 0% interest rate. Virtually no wind noise on the highway. After I drive this car for a few thousand miles I will update this review.

This is very ridiculous for someone to spend so much on a vehicle that is basically a lemon.  My car has been in and out of the shop and right now it need a brake job and alignment with only 12000mile. Very disappointed.

"
jaguar,e-pace,2019,Dennis Kennedy, 06/19/2019,I love my E-Pace,5,"I have used the same process when purchasing a new car for the last 5 vehicles I have purchased. I first research on line various vehicles in the class that I am interested in at the time. In the past it has always been a sports car. I then compare different vehicles using Edmunds and Kelly. After narrowing my selections I schedule test drives. Once I decide on a specific vehicle I go back to the internet to build the specific vehicle on the manufactures website and request a quote. Jaguar was quick to respond and amazingly had the E-Pace I built. The Corris Grey Metallic exterior along with the 19"" Satin Dark Gray wheels and tinted winds makes a beautiful vehicle. While it is an SUV I still feel that I have the feel and handling of a sports car. The sound system is superb as is the navigation system. Bluetooth connectivity is excellent and I particularly like the ""Read Out"" function when a text is received while I'm driving. The memory for the front seats is great since I am considerably taller than my wife. I have to admit that some things took a little while to get used to since my last car did not have the back up cameras. I love that when you put the car in reverse the passenger side mirror angles down. The gear shift really isn't a gear shift in the old sense. I would relate it more to a joy stick changing from one function to another. It is a simple matter to press the button and move from Park, to Drive or Reverse. My sales adviser went into great detail on all aspects of the vehicle as there are so many.  He also assisted me in setting up my Jaguar Remote connectivity on my smartphone. How cool is that. I can connect with my car on my phone, see numerous details about my car, lock it, unlock it, start it or contact to Jaguar if I have trouble. Most people are looking for a place for their phone when they get in a car. The E-Pace solved that problem with a slot in between the cup holders right in front of the center console. Raise the arm rest of the center console and in addition to ample storage there are 2 USB ports, a Micro Sim card slot and a 12 volt outlet. If you get the impression I like my car you are right I love it.

jaguar,e-pace,2019,Bobbybo, 12/07/2019,Excellent Vehicle,5,"My wife and I have owned numerous SUV's over the years and really love this vehicle. It is fun to drive with excellent handling and braking which stops on a dime. 
We have the nearly 300 horsepower turbocharged 4 cylinder model and it is very quick.
The safety features are excellent as well with automatic braking if you would happen to not see a pedestrian or biker in time, it will stop the vehicle for you. 
The heated windshield will come in handy in the winter, plus the heated seats and steering wheel.

jaguar,e-pace,2019,J., 03/13/2019,Tried out at rental car place,3,"Was offered this car In lieu of the car I originally reserved, as it was available for the same price.  I was excited to drive a Jag and was pleased with the exterior styling, though it could‚Äôve had sharper, more future-forward lines.  The interior seemed somewhat bland, with plastic-y materials on the dash and side panels.  The gear shift was annoying, as there is a button you must push to put the car in drive when all other gears simply require a slide forward or back.  Never could find the cup holders, which should be obvious.  It wasn‚Äôt until I googled to find out where they were that I learned they are hidden under a plastic tray that at first glance appears to be an integrated charging dockattached to the center console.  The navigation system, once set, is quite nice and accurate.  Unfortunately, you have to first enter the state, city, street name, then number of the place you‚Äôd like to go.  Driving this SUV was fun, steering was precise but smoothe, and braking was responsive.  Excessive road noise and lack of rear passenger space took away from a pleasant ride.  All this being said, I personally drive a 2019 Subaru Outback and am pleased that it is way more user friendly with intuitive technology, and the interior looks and is way more luxe than this overpriced, underwhelming vehicle.

jaguar,f-pace,2017,Okomfo, 09/09/2017,"Good Looking, Fun to Drive, Good Reliability",5,"I had to order the F-Pace R-Sport from the factory in England because I couldn't find the options that I was looking for at the dealerships around my area. This R-Sport 2.0d has good looks, great torque, fun to drive and awesome gas mileage - 37 mpg in the city and 40 mpg on the highway.  There were some initial issues with reliability that was related to check-engine-light and the A/C. These were fixed at the dealership. I have owned this vehicle for over 2 years now and I am very pleased with it. All the initial problems I had after owning the vehicle seem to have disappeared. I now have 12,000 miles and the vehicle is running very well and I am very happy with it. I will recommend this F-Pace R-Sport as a buy.
"
jaguar,f-pace,2017,JagFPace17, 12/31/2016,Sports Car in Jaguar Cat's Clothing...,5,"I was pretty excited at the opportunity to borrow the new F-Pace and managed to log nearly 700 miles in varying road conditions while in my possession for the week. The first thought that came to mind as I initially stepped on the throttle was ""Wow, this is a sports car in Jaguar SUV form!"". The frame/body feels extremely rigid and solid, the grip of the wheels is beyond confidence inspiring and feels firmly planted w/no signs of slip even when making very quick tight turns on damp roads, and the same F-Type engine aggressively launches this performance SUV especially in Dynamic Mode. Gas mileage is excellent for this amount of power in an SUV (23+ mpg in mixed driving). The new generation infotainment system is thankfully much improved, quick, and easy to use and there's tons of room for passengers and cargo alike.
Now the minor gripes I can point to, and there are a few, include the rotary gear shift dial is very imprecise and just a poor overall design for shifting to exact gears as it's easy to rotate and overshoot to an unintended gear (R or P). The window controls on the door are oddly and annoyingly switched w/the seat memory controls? The gas tank is small and should ideally hold at least 2 more gallons for long road trips. There's some bit of hard plastic in the Premium model. The most annoying and awkward thing, and I'm not a big person, for some reason no matter how I adjusted the seat or entry, I always had to crane my neck to avoid hitting the top of the roof when entering the vehicle?
The following is subjective but overall I generally like the exterior/interior design and finish of my Audi Q5 2.0 T more. Though the Q5 feels more like a quiet luxury SUV, performance-wise the F-Pace makes my Q5 seem like a 'grandpa mobile'! If you consider the minor gripes trivial and you really enjoy performance in your vehicles, Jaguar has successfully produced an SUV to more than compete w/other high performance SUVs along w/the added excitement, style, and drama of a Jaguar!

jaguar,f-pace,2017,alan m, 06/12/2016,Fantastic car.,5,"Test drove Porsche Macan, BMW X3/4, Audi Q5, Mercedes GLC350, and bought the F-Pace. Compared to the competition, The Jag is simply the best combination of size, power, comfort, handling and technology. Time will tell if the long-term reliability and re-sale are acceptable. For a new to market vehicle, in the hottest market segment, Jag knocked this one out of the park.

jaguar,f-pace,2017,Rick from Montreal, 11/30/2016,20 D -180 hp much better than you think,5,"we are from Montreal Canada and bought our 20D -R Sport about 3 weeks ago and made our usual drive from Montreal to Phoenix  Arizona to stay the winter home. Having to order this SUV without driving the 20D was a bit scary after test driving the 35T--I thought the 180 HP would be underpowered --noisy and lack acceleration especially uphill. Wow--was I ever surprised with my very first diesel. The torque really does all the work effortlessly. It's plenty fast enough. Driving at speeds of 75-82 mpg---with 600 lbs of luggage in the back for 10-14 hours a day--we were getting 35-41mpg--pretty awesome. One time passing a car at 75 mpg the excelartion was so good that in a matter of seconds I was at 96mpg. Coming from Montreal where gas prices are between $4-5/ Gallon--the gas mileage was a factor in buying this car. I have been a Lexus RX and NX SUV owner for 17 years and needed a change-they were getting a little boring and their Navigation is so bad I carried a Garmin at all times--it would take me either the wrong way or out of my way many times--The Jag Navigation system was awesome and even told you to prepare to exit to the right or left --in 2 miles--giving you plenty of time to get in the proper lane--never missed an exit or panicked to get over quickly to exit. The Seats are so comfortable I would say they are equal to the Lexus RX and superior to the smaller NX--NEVER got a sore back or butt even after being in the car for 14 hours. The 14 ways adjustable seats are worth the option. The car handles flawlessly and you feel like you are driving the car with all 4 PAWS on the road--not driving a car that is on top of 4 wheels. I have seen and read almost every review on this car and the few little complaints that came up are non-issues--the window controls are up on top---not an issue--how often do you roll down your windows?? And it would spoil the design of the inside doors--then they would look like every other car.--The Standard Navigation is great  and easy to use--no need to upgrade there. Plus my wife can use it and look for things while we drive where Lexus and many others block you out--(again the need for a Garmin in my Lexus so you don't have to stop) Base stereo at 380 watts is awesome--you don't need 825 watts. Some said the interior plastics looked cheap--I did not see any difference from Jag and the Lexus that would matter--if so--you cant see them anyway-Haven't tried the voice command yet--but I gave up trying with all my Lexus SUV'S --I have 5 of them over the years and none worked.  The driving position is fantastic--you can see the front and sides of the car--this is the only SUV my wife can drive where she can actually see the front and sides--other SUV's--all she saw was glass out the front which makes it more difficult to judge distances when turning or parking.The 20D is very quiet and after driving Lexus for 17 years with quiet and comfort--you do want that in a Luxury car--so I prefer the 20d over the 35T--which is pretty noisy due to its extra power and exhaust system--it does sound sporty and is faster--but if you drive like that you will pay at the pumps and probably get a few extra tickets as well--we don't drive cars like that in the real world anyway---if you do--try the 20D is Dynamic Sports mode--it gives you plenty of pick up and a sporty drive. I do hope this car is as reliable as Lexus was to me--in 17 years and 5 different SUV's with Lexus--I went to the dealer only Once--for a rattle in the roof---that's why I kept buying them---just couldn't put up with their Navigation system with the Mouse and Finger pad---actually was pretty dangerous to use while driving for anything as it controlled stereo and other things---Touch System is the Jaguar I so much easier and faster-- at least your passenger can use it so you can keep your eyes on the road.   Great job Jaguar---if it's as reliable as I
 am used to--I will be a customer for a long time.--

jaguar,f-pace,2017,David in Nashville area, 09/28/2016,Best highedr performance vehicle I've ever owned,5,"I just sold my 2009 E350 with AMG package.  I LOVED the stereo and the ride; the Jag is better at both levels.  I also currently own a 2013 BMW 335XI and I love it.  However, I'm bored with it compared to this Jag.  My wife and I have had the F-Pace for seven weeks and it gets better everyday.  In sport mode it is super aggressive and incredibly responsive.  In standard driving mode it glides along the interstate.  A recent trip to the Gulf from Nashville was nothing short of fantastic.  The front seats are superior to both the Mercedes and the BMW.  The cabin is very quiet with very little wind noise.  This beast will get you in trouble fast-----at 2500 RPM I found us sailing along at 91 MPH (didn't mean to).  I can't get enough of this vehicle; the sound system is superior to anything I've heard; lots of bass and crystal clear mid and high ranges.  I love streaming music from my phone with the easy BlueTooth pairing.  I found myself buying music just to test the bass.  Ours is British Racing Green in color and it is beautiful.  While the cargo space seems a little tight it was more than adequate to stow our luggage as well as my daughter's and her two little girls.  Now, I crave driving it and wonder about the Jaguar sedans----if they're this good then I just might have to get one in pace of the BMW!

jaguar,f-pace,2017,Jaftet, 12/08/2016,Excellent Midsize SUV Choice,5,"I've owned this vehicle since October and have had a great experience driving it daily. Having driven other performance vehicles, it is truly a sports car in an SUV body. It accelerates incredibly well, handles well on narrow terrains, and the back seats are roomy enough for two six footers in my house. The grunt it lets out on acceleration is absolutely priceless. No mechanical issues so far. A few minor concerns: I am not quite six feet tall but my knee hits the rear door opener sometimes when I enter the car. I am learning to adjust but this has happened a few times. Once seated in the car, my right knee rubs against a bulging trim on the side of the gear compartment. That will give you a bruise on long commutes if you rest on it like i do. As you would expect in most performance cars the suspension is pretty tight, which means you are not pampered on rough surfaces. Otherwise, please test drive other potential competitors before you drive this car. My experience is that there is only one other PERFORMANCE SUV class out there - Porche Macan and Cayenne.

jaguar,f-pace,2017,Bill, 09/15/2016,"F Pace ""S""",5,"Wow, we just picked up our F Pace ""S"" after a three month wait.  And was it worth every minute.  Traded in a 12 Mercedes GLK 350 and that car wasn't even close to being in this category.  This car is sweet.  We got the British Racing Green, with the black 20"" rim.  What a car!  A looker!  The interior is not plush, just plain comfortable.  Only gave a poor rating in traction, cuz the wife hit the gas on the wet road with the 380hp engine, and had to hang on in a turn.  It's that mean.  I'm the husband of the owner and I love my two drives in it so far.  Hope resale value holds in 4-5 years, unlike the GLK-350.  Meantime, I can't wait for my turn to drive.  Did I mention the app that auto starts the car.  My wife is freaking over that. Love it.  Cooling seats awaiting in the summer, and heat when winter comes.  This car is much more than all the reviews you have read.  They got this one right, right out of the box...

jaguar,f-pace,2017,Andrew, 08/27/2018,"Well, I wanted a car with personality...",3,"Short version is that this is a great car for a driving enthusiast that enjoys a fun ride on a curvy highway.  As a daily driver dealing with stop and go traffic in the city, there are far better options.  I've have my 2017 F-Pace 35T for about 8 months now.  I have the upgraded InControl Touch Pro infotainment system.  I originally purchased it as a CPO with only 7200 miles on it.  Great way to save some $$ and get an extended warranty and still be within the ""breaking-in"" period for a new car.  While there is a lot to love about this car, there are some significant issues that cannot be overlooked.  I'll start with what I love about the car so this doesn't feel like a total gripe session.  This is easily the most sporty and attractive looking Crossover on the road today.  It has great passing power.  The car strongly accelerates when you are already at speed.  Responsive infotainment system with customized screens.   High quality leather seating surfaces and a quiet cabin.  Throaty engine noise.  Plenty of cargo space in the rear with the seats up.  Tight steering and a fantastic turn radius.  The cargo door opens and closes really quickly.  Unfortunately, there are some design issues that really detract from the car.  First off is the small gas tank.  16.6 Gallons is too small for a Crossover with only ""acceptable"" fuel economy.  I do mostly city driving and am filling up every 250 miles (often less).  The infotainment sometimes takes a while to boot up properly.  The convenience controls are also in odd places.  The window controls sit at the top the door by the window while the memory controls are down on the armrest.   The start button is where the volume knob should be and the volume knob is where the tuning knob should sit.  Oh, and there is no physical tuning knob.  Also, there is far too much plastic on the interior for a $60k car.  Higher end models get more leather wrapped surfaces, but Jaguar cheaped out on the Prestige model.  Small object storage is also pretty weak.  Not enough places to store your everyday items especially if you want to keep them out of site.  Oh, and the rear seats do not fold flat.  It is a matter of preference, but for a daily driver, I think the suspension is way too tight.  You will feel every bump and imperfection in the road.  Add in the creaking noise I get out of the back (either from the rear seats or the suspension - Jaguar can't figure it out or fix it apparently) and it can make for an aggravating daily drive.   My biggest issue though is probably the sluggish start from a dead stop.  Unless I am really aggressive, the car just doesn't start quickly from 0 in Normal mode.  Have to put it in Dynamic mode for good city driving but this kills the fuel economy.  Also, I'd like the option to permanently disable the Auto-Stop.  It is a horrible feature that should never have been put on the car.  Having to turn it off every time I start the car is annoying.  Last issue is the parking sensors.  They work fine if the car is in reverse, but the front sensors don't activate without pushing an additional button on the touchscreen (and that doesn't always get them working).  Add in the auto-stop feature and parking in a tight garage can be tedious.  Sorry for the gripe session, I just had to get that all off my chest.  The rest of the car is great.  Really.

jaguar,f-pace,2017,James, 06/12/2016,An amazing experience so far,4,"Ah, the Jaguar F-Pace... An SUV about 10 years to late. But, better late than never. The F-Pace is an amazingly attractive car and that is what attracted me at first, then they told me about the Elite Maintenance Program (5 Years no cost maintenance) then the fact that the average invoice for a Jaguar hovers on average around $4,000 dollars. The 380 hp V6 equipped on the S trim is much more power than the average F-Pace driver will need, but does come in handy for short passing roads and highway merging etc. 
Gas mileage is of some concern especially because the fuel tank can only hold 16.6 gallons of gas. A 4,000 pound SUV with a combined average of 20mpg should be equipped with at least a 17.4 gallon gas tank. Again Im sure Jaguar engineers have a reason for such a small gas tank but I wish they would have made it a bit larger. The In Control Touch Pro infotainment system is amazing based solely on it being a touch screen (I do not believe Mercedes, BMW, Lexus or any other luxury brand comes equipped with touch screens anymore). 
The Brakes don't seem as powerful as they should be but I still have confidence in them. 
Overall the F-Pace has been an amazing car so far and has definitely gathered some looks especially when I select neutral and push the gas down and everyone hears the engine pop. Definitely worth a look.

jaguar,f-pace,2017,Tony, 01/21/2018,Check Engine Light,4,"Check engine light came on first 250 miles. Dealer had car for 12 days, Can't find the problem. Rest light, Used it to run personal errands by dealer.  Check engine light on for second time while on vacation.  500 miles later it went out. Dealer said don't worry about it.  Several months later. Check engine light on for 3rd time.  Had car for 8 days replaced vacuum hose.  One month later Check engine light on.  Still waiting to hear back from deal what the problem is.  During this time the car has had problems with information system. Radio changes pages randomly with no input.  Change from sirius to am without input. Dealer has worked on it several times.  Has gotten better but still changes without input,
Finally got it fixed and have no problems last 30K miles.

jaguar,f-pace,2017,Richard, 10/07/2017,Fuel Mizer,5,"Unbelievable fuel economy; currently receiving 34mpg in town and 40mpg on highway at 70mph, computed against fuel receipts. Fuel economy continues to increase as  miles accumulate, currently at 8500 miles. No cost option of 18"" light weight rims and tires greatly improves ride with no effect on handling. Receives stares everywhere it is parked.Great handling in rural Tennessee mountains. No reliability issues to date. I hesitated to purchase but am totally satisfied and would do so again. Update at 16200 miles: vehicle continues to impress with fuel economy and cost of ownership. I‚Äôd buy it again in a heartbeat! Update at 22,000 miles: continuing to be impressed with the vehicle's performance; fuel mileage continues to improve-recent trip at 70mph yielded 41.5mpg. Driver seat still the most comfortable of any car I have owned.Up date at 30,000 miles: Fuel mileage continues to increase; City mileage up to 36mpg with highway holding at 39-40. Ride comfort improved as suspension loosens slightly. Wonderful having a vehicle with no cost maintenance for five years.

jaguar,f-pace,2017,Leonor, 08/11/2017,"Drives like a dream, when it's not in the shop",2,"It is a beautiful car, it handles like a dream on the highway, but mine has been in the shop for a total of one month out of the four we've owned it. And it is not fixed yet. Electrical system baffles everybody. Service at the dealership not what you would expect from a luxury car, but they seem quite overwhelmed with work. Must be all those cars that need repairs. Also, under the steering wheel, the collar surrounding it, a clump of plastic, apparently manufacturing defect. Seriously?
Review update
The car is almost three years old, it rattles from a couple of places, it's in the process of having speakers replaced, I had to replace even the key FOB as the rubber was peeling off. We have a 2012 Jetta that is holding up better. Such a shame for such a nice car, but the quality control is dismal.

jaguar,f-pace,2017,Gene H., 08/06/2018,"Ammonite gray performance SUV, a fast cat!",4,"The F-Pace is a wonderful road car! smooth and quiet on most road surfaces. Not so much going over speed bumps... very stiff... go slowly! Performance with the 3.0 supercharged engine is almost Tesla-like. Instant acceleration when needed. I agree with another reviewer's comment about needing a few more gallon capacity. 16.5 is a bit short of ideal. I get 260 - 280 miles per tank around town. Highway mileage is around 330 - 380 miles, depending on traffic. My best is 26 mpg from Carmel, CA to Orange county CA.  Overall I've enjoyed my F-Pace for the 2 years I've owned it. It's quiet and very solid feeling, great carrying capacity, as well as reasonable mileage for a performance SUV along the lines of the Porsche Macan, Alfa Stevio, and Maserati Lavente... at a more reasonable price.

jaguar,f-pace,2017,Rhea S, 03/06/2017,I Have A Lemon,2,"The F-Pace I own is 6 months old and the computer system has caused the entire car to go haywire (from the side view mirrors to the car not starting at all).  The car is in shop for the 2nd time in a month.  In addition, the roadside assistance kept me waiting for 3 hours.

jaguar,f-pace,2017,Jim, 08/25/2016,F-Pace Sport- Shopping,5,"Having been a Jag owner for years, and watching then get much better, I decided that I would trade my Porsche SUV on the F-Pace.  Test drove one at Jag Dealer in Richmond VA and confirmed that I would buy.  I wanted a specific color and list of options.  Dealer offered to order but decided to see what was available in US. Dealer located 4 in US with my specs and he spent a week negotiating with another dealer to trade. I have only 294 miles so honeymoon not over but so far car is everything I expected and more.  I've owned Land Rovers, Porsche, and Chevrolet SUV's but this one is perfect in size and power. Mixed average MPG of 20. Recommend consideration if you are in the market for a top of the line SUV.

jaguar,f-pace,2017,JagQueen, 07/13/2017,"Pinch me, am I dreaming?",5,"I am attracted to SUV's.  Recently while walking through a parking garage, my eye caught a very uniquely styled SUV.  I immediately walked over to it to investigate what was it?   To my surprise it was the F Pace - ""S"" model Jaguar, SUV.  Holy smokes this car is gorgeous.  I rushed home to educate myself on this car by stopping in to the Edmunds.com website.  I was able to research and compare this car to other competitive models.  Here is what I found.  It is the widest of all SUV's in this category.  The F Pace - ""S"" model has that European interior styling in red and black - with red stitching accenting it's curves; very sharp and appealing.  The drivers seat is very comfortable and mimics the feeling of being held tightly in the cockpit of a race car.  (It is very comfortable).  The cargo space is far more generous than other competitors.  I have had this car since April 24th, 2017 and have been anxiously waiting to write this review, allowing ample time to report on it's many features.  Here is what I have found.  This car is FAST - I can't emphasize that enough.  I also own a 2013 Challenger - Hemi 375 HP.  The Jag's super charged 3.0 6 cyl. 380 HP engine is fabulous and just as fast - however the Challenger is a 6 sp. manual shift for the thrill seeker in me!  (Female - 63 years old!)  The transmission shifts smooth and seamless, unlike my 2014 Cherokee that had a  8 spd. choppy transmission (replaced after 2 years - a known problem with this model year).  ""Highly responsive"" is the way I would describe not only the acceleration but the steering, rode handling, and breaking system in this Jaguar, SUV.  I have encouraged my family members to drive it and give me their critique - all agree - it is: #1 FAST, #2 Very Responsive,  #3 Comfortable,  #4 Smooth ride.    A few reviewers have commented on the placement of the power window buttons, I really don't mind that they are located on the window ledge.  I tend to drive with my left arm on the ledge anyway.  Yes, the 16.6 gallon gas tank could be bigger.  It takes premium gas, not a deal breaker to me as the Challenger does too.  I wish the gas cap was a locking one, instead of spring loaded.  (Hopefully the days of putting sugar in someones gas tank are a thing of the past).  The touch screen is easy to navigate with only one caveat; changing the radio stations from either the steering wheel or the touch screen results in a 2-3 second delay.  In other words, it doesn't immediately switch to another radio station at first touch.  When using the voice command option whether the turn by turn navigation, or voice activated call system- it results in hearing a soothing women's voice, unlike Alexa and Siri.  The navigation system is accurate and easy to use once you adapt to it.  The interior luminescent night lighting is sharp!  The rear camera feature that can be viewed with just a touch of a button at any time, even when the car is in motion - is awesome.  Speaking of the backup camera - it provides a wide view that is extremely clear - seemingly HD quality.  A few things could be improved upon in my opinion; I don't like the position location of the volume/channel control adjacent to the vehicle information section positioned on the left side of the steering wheel.  For some reason when changing the radio station from that location, I end up hitting the middle ""OK"" button which sends you into a menu of car information, such as the lane departure settings, or front collision settings.  I find it a little annoying.   It seems that car manufacturers are compelled to be eco efficient.  When stopped at a light, with your foot on the brake, the car engine shuts off.  Once you lift your foot from the brake the engine restarts immediately.  This takes some getting used to, but the good news is, you can turn it off with a touch of a button, anytime.  I love having the option to turn
 something off.  There are 3 modes in which to drive this car in; eco (highway, rode trip mode), normal, and sport.  There are some differences when switching from normal to sport - but honestly, this car is so fast in normal mode - I personally don't feel the sport mode is necessary.  If I need anymore speed under my foot, I just switch to my Challenger - 6 spd Manual - Hemi, for that thrill ride ""fix.""   My major dilemma with this car is whether or not I buy it after the 3 year lease is up.  I love it so much, I can't imagine turning it in.  I have never leased a car before.  I never thought I could afford to drive a Jag!  By comparison, a fully loaded Ford Explorer, Lexus, Volvo XC 90, Lincoln MKC, or Lexus - all fall into the range of what this car costs. (65K - fully loaded ""S"" model).  IF you do the research and read the reviews you will hear the common theme, this car out performs the Mercedes, BMW, Porsche, or Lexus, SUV's.  I HIGHLY recommend the Jaguar - F Pace - you won't be sorry!  One last important detail:  The Warranty is the best of all - 6yrs/60K.

jaguar,f-pace,2017,RK, 06/30/2016,F-Pace is an ACE,5,"I have been waiting for Jaguars all new XE and F-Pace models to be release have test driven them 3 months ago well the obvious answer that made my choice clear is go with F-Pace. XE lacked room for a average height personality both in front and in the rear seating and also the head room. But F-Pace though comes under a crossover(SUV) class still surprised me with the new content jaguar had induced into F Pace. I am an employee with average salary between 60K-75K. I have always been planning to own a jaguar as i am towards the style and performance of Jaguars outcome. First thing on my mind would this be a proper investment for me ? is it really worth the money? Can i maintain ? How about resale ? Well the answer is Yes, it is worth it a 101% surely for people who needed an spacious car providing luxury of an world class luxury brand and along with the power and performance. My suggestion is to go for a v6 340hp which balances the value for you put in. I have currently owned a new Jaguar F Pace prestige 35t Ebony Black. 1 week old from now. the moment you drive it out from the showroom it puts a smile on your face and doesnt stop surprising you. Jaguar has done an excellent job at the steering functionality, adaptive dynamics is solely for the riders who can get the most out of the jaguar f pace using all the combinations. Only thing that currently concerns me is the mileage which is around 12 mpg in city and around 17-20 mpg on highways.  Hoping during the course of use of 2-3 months the mileage might increase depending on the the driving style adaptation. Apart form these F-Pace is really an awesome ride filled with attitude and masculine attire without compromising on the style and performance. I am really satisfied with the car. Current booking and delivery dates are around 3 months from the booking dates, may get one earlier that the date expected if you are lucky enough to find a cancelled order of someone.

jaguar,f-pace,2017,Tim, 09/07/2017,Amazing Vehicle,4,"I test drove the 2.0 gas turbo 4 cyl and the 3.0 gas supercharged V6 with 340hp. While the turbo 4 was more than adequate, the V6 is incredible in terms of power and sound. This thing sounds wonderful under acceleration. I've owned my F-Pace for a few weeks. It is a blast to drive. It feels like a sports car in terms of steering, acceleration, and feel but the ride is smooth and confident.  It is amazing how Jaguar was able to retain a smooth ride yet deliver this type of performance and handling. You really need to drive it to believe it. The design of this vehicle is gorgeous and you won't see other examples of yourself everywhere you go. The relative exclusivity of the F-Pace was a selling point for me. There are a few negatives with this vehicle however. My biggest complaint is interior quality. My Prestige trim level was $55,000. Other vehicles in this price range far exceed the interior quality of the F-Pace. There is a great deal of hard plastic and I'm concerned about the quality of the leather, but time will tell. In addition, the standard infotainment system is slow to respond and I've had trouble changing channels on the Sirius/XM radio as it often gets locked on one channel. You actually have to turn the car off to reset this. Seriously?  If Jaguar addresses interior quality and the glitchy infotainment system, this vehicle would be unbeatable. My brother's Porsche Macan rides like a washing machine and is tiny compared to my F-Pace.  Overall, this is an incredible SUV.

jaguar,f-pace,2017,I.S., 09/03/2016,Jaguar hits a home run,5,"I'm a Porsche fan. I owned 4 Cayennes since Porsche started manufacturing them. I currently own a 2015 Cayenne and a 2015 Audi Q5 diesel.  The F-Pace comes out, and it's a vehicle from a completely different mold.  The Germans are much more relaxing to drive. The Jag is far more engaging,  with much quicker reflexes and a bit harsher ride (again this is the First Edition with 22 "" tires). So far all is great, the Brembo brakes are superb, the interior is gorgeous,  from the outside,  this car looks like nothing else on the road available today, and all the gadgetry that comes with the First Edition is easy to learn, override and live with. The engine has plenty of power and a decent fuel economy for a vehicle of this size and weight.  I get many compliments from strangers and a surprised look when they find out this is a Jaguar.

In Eco mode  running at 65 mph I get about 41 miles per gallon ( CRAZY). In the Dynamic sport mode mileage went down  about 29 MPG . I live in New Jersey and now Diesel is cheaper than gas .

jaguar,f-pace,2017,Pete, 09/27/2016,Still an Awesome Ride!,5,"With 18 months under my belt, I love the F-Pace even more. I have averaged 1058 miles a month and have a much better feel for handling on various road surfaces. It performed extremely well on snowy and icy road surfaces and consistently responds well on the highway. It's almost as easy to maneuver as a small car. I know the grunt it lets out is a little loud for some but it's got the power to match it; think BMW M5. You turn the engine on and the ground trembles. Step on it accidentally in traffic and you will tremble. I did discover that the reason my ezpass device doesn't work is the metal in the windscreen. The solution is to place the ezpass device behind the rearview mirror.

jaguar,f-pace,2017,Val Santana, 11/15/2016,So happy I could purrrrr.,4,"I highly recommend it.  Drives like a car, but higher off the ground.  As of this review, I've owned it for 3 months and 3K miles.  Favorite features:  Remote start & climate via phone app, ventilated/cooled seats, lane keep assist, cavernous trunk, auto-high beams.   Things I hate about it:  Auto start/stop engine is so annoying!  Yes, there's a button to disable it, but it should stay disabled until you enable it manually!  The nav system is straight from 2006, and  the climate control is big f'ing mess of buttons.  Such a hassle to use, especially if you live in a place with large temperature swings.  Want to go from 60F to 77F?  You'll have to press that temp button 17 times!  It would've been better to use knobs like in the XJ or F-Type.    Also, for your inconvenience, there's no ""off"" button for the climate on the console.  Nope - you'll have to use the touch screen to navigate to ""Climate"", where there's an ""on/off"" button.  Genius.  The Tailgate doesn't always work properly.  Sometimes it won't open at all when I use the gesture kick, and sometimes it won't close when I push the button on the tailgate, beeping the horn twice.   I'm also not very happy with the noise from the engine.  It makes an unpleasant thrum when driving at low rpm, and doesn't sound anything like an F-type S at high rpm.  Lastly, there's a creaking sound coming from the rear of the car.  At this price range, it's just unacceptable.  Other than these snags, I love it.

If you have any mechanical background, you know how well this car is built.  It is a steal right now at the current prices.   It is a better buy then the mercedes, lexus, Porsche, Audi, BMW, or any other luxury SUV.  Now that the full reviews have come out, all positive, I suspect it will be harder to find one with all the options you want.  My family just loves it for long trips.  I love it for the back roads.

jaguar,f-pace,2017,Retired grandma, 02/25/2017,My new baby,5,"I got my love of cars from my father and keep up with the new models.  I am a female and my husband hates salesmen so I typically test drive by myself.  I have had the new F-Pace in my sights for a while and test drove it and bought it the next day.  I have a heavy foot and have owned a 71 Mercury XR7, 84 Dodge Daytona Turbo, 2000 Mercedes E 430, 2008 Lincoln Navigator and now the Jaguar.  I test drove both the diesel and the 3.V-6 Cvl.  The diesel was a little more than I wanted to spend so I opted for the gasoline engine and I love it!  For some reason the sport mode feels better on the streets in my neighborhood and it purrs on the highway.  I bought the white with black wheels.  The wheels are growing on me but I wanted chrome, which was not offered and the salesman stressed that no wheel swapping was allowed.  The standard wheels looked dull and bland to me. I may switch them out after a couple of years.  I want to see how the long the black holds up. We are tall people and have plenty of room up front.  All I want in a new car is leather seats, a sun roof, satellite radio and some get up and go! I like just about everything about the suv but there are a few things that I feel should have been included on a $50,000 plus vehicle.  1. Why isn't back up sensors standard.  I have the camera but it us useless without the alert from a sensor. 2. The 12 V power socket that located inside the center compartment is useless unless you leave your phone inside the thing. My phone won't fit because I have something else there, no space, and the lid won't close over the cord.  I have to use the rear seat plug.  I do love that the electronics are easy to operate.  I used the remote start twice and it worked fine.  I have only had the car one week.  I am still getting use to all the gadgets and trying to figure out what all I have.  The quick start guide is great and helpful although I have yet to figure out why the car sometimes turns off when I place it in park.  I will make an appointment for someone to come out and go over it all in a few weeks as they offer this as a perk.  I am keeping a running list of questions because they are some options that I can't figure out if I have or not.  Overall, I love the F-Pace.  I wish I could have afforded the Sport  but I am very satisfied.  I have only seen one other F-Pace on the road.  The car gets plenty of looks and I have had people ask me what I am driving.  Love, love it!

jaguar,f-pace,2017,Patrick, 04/03/2019,What a nightmare!! DON'T BUY A JAGUAR!!!,1,"Bought my 2017 F-Pace 20D new and have had nothing but problems. I've have it in over 24 times for issues like trim falling off, rear hatch wouldn't close, electrical issues, numerous engine issues. It's been in the shop now for over a month because the fuel rail cracked and when the shop replaced it, they sprayed diesel fuel all over the engine and now they can't get the smell out of it. And it's also gone in to ""restricted performance"" mode reducing the top speed of the vehicle to 20 MPH, very dangerous!! I initiated a ""buyback"" the the lovely people at Jaguar said it didn't qualify because it's not been in the shop for the same reason more that twice. No logic here!! I now have a lawyer involved.

jaguar,f-pace,2017,Ed, 01/24/2017,Fantastic car,5,"I traded in my 2008 BMW X5 (owned for 8.5 years). I was very skeptical and nervous about getting into Jaguar due to brand reliability history. However, upon reading more and more about the company and after 2 test drives I realized that this is the only SUV I want! (test drove other models: BMW X3, X5, Audi Q7, Lexus RX, MB GLE).  I am not a lease guy, and with 5 year warranty and scheduled maintenance this was a no brainer for me. The car is great overall.  Being that it's brand new, there are some minor issues: the door speaker makes crackling/resonating sounds only when using the phone (playing radio/ipod is not affected - weird!); second issue is driver seat - recently started making clicking sound when I move around in the seat as something is loose; bluetooth connections sometimes doesn't connect your phone to the car automatically, requiring you to select it manually on the screen.  So far used navigation only once and it gave me a super weird route: took me to the highway they told me to get off and used streets only to get back to the same highway one exit later! ( there was no traffic on highway, so it wasn't done to save time). I was advised from the dealer to download an app for navigation and use it while you connect your phone to car via usb. This way you can have much better navigator on the screen of your car.  One more dissapointment is that there is no CD player in standard tech set, only if you chose to upgrade to Technology package for over 3K.  I specifically didn't want to do that due to fear of glitches in dashboard instrument panel, which is entirely digital in the upgraded options. I also wish that the tank size was 2-3 gallons larger.  Overall the car is great!

The seats, sunroof, trim, mirrors all work naturally in sync and are extremely well done. It's beauty, Sexy, FAST, Handles amazingly well, extremely intelligent and well coordinated. It's the lighted logos, lights, sync of turning the car off and having the car light up and accent the different driving modes. There so much that I love about this car it's truly been exceeding my expectations every day. The extra features such as the G-Meter are fun for my as a Navy Carrier pilot, being able to change the displays like a commercial pilot are super fun and it simply just feels good to drive. EVERYTHING is well built and user friendly and ergonomic. This is truly a revolutionary product. It's a sportscar built to look like an stylish SUV, but also has the added features that exceed Mercedes Luxury cars. It's not just the features that make this car special, it's that they work well together and look good as well. Everything is classy as well as built like a race car. It's raw power, braking and suspension and steering are exciting as well as tame when you want them to be. The Eco feature also enables me to get 25mpg easily during CITY driving, or 12 racing!! I'm more than happy with this car and features.!!!!"

jaguar,f-pace,2017,Rebecca Xue, 09/18/2017,Very bad car I ever have,1,"I purchased this car at the end of May 2017. The engine was fully stopped/auto shuttled down suddenly when pushing paddle after stopped at Stop sign and tried making the right turn. The car was totally dead but the D (Drive Mode) light was still on but the switch was not able to turn to P (parking). You were not able to push paddle any more. The only thing you can do is to press the Start (Engine) button to make it restart. This happened 5 times so far since I have this car. The car was sent to dealer for fix after it happened 4 times. I was told it was fixed after a week and it was safe to drive again. But it happened after a week. Now it is in dealer again. It was very danger when your car was suddenly dead on the road and the car behind you almost hit you. I may need to have life insurance to drive this car!!! Talked to the general manager at the dealer this morning and was told not able to return. I wish this is the option. Very update and unhappy with this car.

jaguar,f-pace,2017,Chas, 03/17/2017,What does the F stand for?,2,"Except for the look and ""sex appeal"" and rod handling just can't find anything that justifies the price and immediate 30% write off. So far nothing but disappointments, problems, poor craftsmanship and malfunctions. Not kidding in first week it was back in the body shop to try and correct the non inertial engine hood closing... About 1/2 inch on one side and 1/8-1/4 on the other. Then the electronics just don't work consistently... And you must restart the engine to reset! Crazy! Poorly designed and particularly cheap finishes on interior with razor sharp edges in door handle assembly...  Window sills scratch just by looking at them... And now the latest... The entire sunroof and screen mechanizum is defective - Jammed the roof on an angle and broke the track to both on BOTH sides! Where is the quality... The driver seat jolts back about an 1/8 of an inch with every acceleration! And that same seat is hard as a rock and good for maybe 10 min drive before the siatica sets in...  All the fou fou add owns like the bottom door trim is again of cheap quality and an invitation to collecting road grim and water which we all know Jaguars just love.... Remember when they used to rust in the folder?! All in all it looks good and actually drives pretty well although I don't recommend the 22"" rims for everyday driving... Unless jaguar provides a masseuse for afterwards..  Personally I am disappointed and want to rid myself of it.. Don't expect that will be easy as even the dealers don't want them back... After all they have hundreds in inventory - not selling now the words out?

I only hope that this will prove to be a reliable purchase. So far this has been a gem. Mileage is OK. 20mpg combined so far for a 20min local ride and 15min highway. I was unable to locate separate controls for rear A/C and I dont think there is one. If I have not mentioned anything else means I have no problem with the rest :) . overall, feels great!!

jaguar,f-pace,2017,Laureen, 12/31/2017,Performance SUV,5,"Great performance, engine response and drivability, especially in dynamic mode.  This is the only SUV that we found that was equal or better in almost all categories than our older X5 that we wanted to replace.  A couple of complaints: the auto stop is truly annoying and it should remember that you want it to stay disabled until selected.  The remote app is slow and would be convenient if the FOB also started the vehicle.  Infotainment system is outdated, but it works ok.  The gas tank should hold more fuel, although 22 mpg is not bad for this type of performance.

jaguar,f-pace,2017,Ron, 05/20/2019,Buggy Infotainment System,4,"The Good:  Overall, I really like my F Pace.  It's one of the best looking mid-size luxury, performance cross-over vehicles out there, and it accelerates and handles as well as a high performance coupe.  Jag could have done a better job with the dash/console materials to give it a higher end finish appropriate to its price tag.  Dealership service and support has been excellent.  It's clear that they take a lot of pride in their cars and are sincere about creating an excellent customer experience.  The Bad:  The Infotainment System in the Jags are notoriously buggy.  In fact, when talking candidly with a Jag dealer employee, she told me that Jaguar corporate had bought back a lot of cars due to issues with the system.  I have owned my F-Pace for about 18 months and have had it to the dealer no less than 6-8 times for issues related to the voice command button not working or the navigation system locking up.  I can't tell you how many times they've told me that the latest firmware update was designed to fix the issues, only to have them occur again while needing the functions most.  I have literally almost gotten into accidents on two occasions while distracted after the Nav system locked up in an unfamiliar area while fumbling to pull my cell phone out and launch Google Maps to figure out which freeway exit to take.  I have written emails to Jaguar, and ultimately even tried to invoke the Lemon Law, but the number of days out of service fell short of the law's requirements.  After about 6+ firmware/software updates, the system is more stable.  The voice command button fails much more infrequently now, and the Nav system also seems more stable.  On the other hand, I use both less than I did originally and rely upon using Google Maps or Waze with my cell phone since I know that they will never fail.  The Infotainment System functions are NOT rocket science, and it is hard to imagine that Jag is still struggling to get these right.  Apple Car Play was not offered when I bought my F Pace, and it should be a standard or at least optional accessory.

----------

This is an update at approximately 20K miles.  After repeated visits to the dealer to update the firmware on the infotainment system with no resolution of the issues described above, I took the car in one final time and demanded that Jaguar replace the entire head unit for the system.  In fact, I told the service writer in no uncertain terms that I wouldn't accept the car back without that being done.  A day later, I received a call stating that the unit was on order and should be installed the following day.

Since the replacement of the complete infotainment system, it has worked as designed, without subsequent failures.  With that said, the lack of Apple Car Play is clearly a design oversight given the fact that many other comparable cars of this model year and price point offered this feature as standard equipment.

The car has not experienced any other significant mechanical issues and is agile and powerful to drive.  I still feel that it is one of the best looking vehicles on the road.

At the price point, Jaguar should improve upon the interior finish quality -- no black plastic buttons, plastic paddle shifters, etc.

jaguar,f-pace,2017,Cliff Moodie, 08/22/2017,$70K for a car 10 years behind the times,1,"I have to admit, performance is good. The ""infotainment"" system is from 2009. or earlier. I have owned a lot of cars and never had one (including a Triumph) where the radio could not hold a station. Satellite and FM are both worthless. The dealer seems to think this is acceptable. More importantly, this is the only car I am aware of that allows you to type into the infotainment system while you drive to program the navigation system. You can not speak to the navigation system at all. Apparently this is a feature available in low end Jags but not in the most expensive cars. I got some nonsense about there being two levels of infotainment and I paid more for one that doesn't work. You can buy a car that performs for less money that has a working radio and navi system.

2/18 Jaguar finally replaced the shark fin antenna and I have working Satellite radio. FM is still poor. No change in the ability to program the navigation system.

This happens on a daily basis and is a very annoying design flaw.  Just as bad, my complaint is basically being ignored by both my local Jaguar dealer and by Jaquar USA.  I get lip service only such as "" the vehicle is performing as it was intended to"".  They are basically reading me a script.  Did they intend to design a vehicle where dirt accumulates daily on the inside of the door panels?    Jaguar was very concerned about how I liked the F-Pace until I started to complain about this issue.  Now I can't get a call back or a satisfactory  response. Very disappointing.  Stay away."

An AWD sedan was at the top of the list for fuel economy and performance.  The FPace stumbled across my research.  Once I saw the diesel's gas mileage, I had to give it a shot.  An SUV that drives like a performance sedan yet has towing capacity and great gas mileage.  The trifecta!  Love this SUV!

Nice engine, good interior -albeit a bit off perfect ergonomics (the window button is where??  No lumbar unless you get the prestige.  Moon roof has small opening in huge glass).  Specked out a Premium and Prestige to $53k and $59k, not far off some X3's we specked out (within a few hundred $).  X3 lease $600-650.  Jag was $800-925. Seriously?  Not even in the same league!

I bought this car (VIN: SADCK2BV0HA061290) in the summer of 2016 at Jaguar Farmington Hills dealer in Farmington Hills, Michigan.  Ongoing issues started after 18 months :  bluetooth dropping, Auto start/stop, front break noise.  2 months after the manufacturer warranty expired (June 2020), coolant got into engine (???) and busted.

The driving experience overall is one of the best I have witnessed so far. Great handling, amazing acceleration and fun to drive while being seated in top notch comfortable seats.
The only negative I can say about this SUV is the infotainment system, which has many bugs and issues. Jaguar dealers have told me in the pass that they would come up with a new updated software update, which has yet to arrive.
But overall love this SUV, best car I have evee drove."
jaguar,f-pace,2018,Tom, 06/23/2017,"First Jaguar, no dissapointment",5,"Paid little more for 2018 model but wanted to have most of the initial quality issues to be solved. So far after 700miles of driving no major issues. Car drives perfectly. Its spacious, quick, comfortable (after adjusting tire pressure which was to high initially) and corners like a sedan. Also interior, in contrary to many reviews, feels fine. No squeaks, rattles etc and materials are quite pleasant.  Audio system is very good as well as navigation (after couple of days I've stopped using google maps on my smart phone). Great car, absolutely no regrets buying it. Even though the initial quality is very good I am little worried about long term reliability but the 5years/60000miles full warranty helps.
1 year update - car still works great and is as much fun as at the beginning. It was very dependable in the snow over the winter. ICTP was updated to fix couple of minor bugs as well as upgrade to 4G network but other than that car runs trouble free. Still hoping for  Apple CarPlay upgrade at some point.
2nd year update - 36k miles and still very satisfied customer. After latest infotainment software upgrade I was able to add Apple Car play as well as OTA options for future upgrades (I hope this will really work). Still drives and feels like new, including the interior, no mechanical issues whatsoever. During the Tahoe winter I had a set of winter Michelin x-ice tires and the car was unstoppable in the snow. Consistently getting 25-27MPG during relaxed hwy cruising.

jaguar,f-pace,2018,Boe, 08/21/2018,20 months and 24K miles,5,"I skipped the R-Sport because the 20 inch wheels ride and accelerate better than the 22s, but this is the sportiest SUV this side of the much smaller Macan or Alfa. Right in the middle of the Macan and Cayenne and X3 and X5 which for me was the sweet spot. I regularly tow a 6x12' trailer loaded to about 4000 lbs with this and it has no problems stopping or going whatsoever. I even towed it up a wet grass/mud hill while loaded and I don't even think a single tire slipped. You can nail it full throttle in the rain and it doesn't spin, it just goes like hell. The AWD on this SUV is phenomenal. Is the mileage great, no, but for the power and size of this vehicle there is nothing better out there unless you want to spend $100k on a Model X and have the trim fall off. Since buying this I have duplicated all of it's rational capabilities with other vehicles and it makes no sense for me to keep making payments on it, but I love it too much to get rid of it. It is a great combination of sport, utility and luxury that I feel is just too good to part with. I've had one issue, it wouldn't eject a cd, and the dealership replaced the unit for free, although I've never played another cd since then.

jaguar,f-pace,2018,DavidR Jaguar F Pace S, 05/06/2019,"Jaguar Rebirth Without Question, Not one issue!!!",5,"I've had my Jaguar F Pace S since March of 2017 and I bought it new with 8 miles on it. I've driven it long and hard on many trips and in daily driving and always performs at the top of it's game since the first day I bought it. The biggest misinformation issue I've noticed on the YouTube reviews by the professional talking press and personal opinion heads is that it has a rough ride. But what everyone failed to mention is that there is a comfort mode option which is what I used the majority of the time unless I'm out intentionally racing around for fun. The ride is just as smooth as all the other cars I drove which included but was not limited to Porsche, Audi, Lexus, Mercedes, BMW, etc. I've driven them all and have own most of them. 99% of the talking head video reviews are non owners who spend just minutes with the car or any car. But the F Pace and F Pace S all ride with great handling and performance and ride just as smooth in comfort mode. My ponies get up and go religiously without fail. I have no thoughts on the Jaguar service department because I've never had to use it, other than my normal oil changes, etc. The warranty was a huge seller for me as well. Nothing like it on any other car that I'm aware of. I drove all the Porsche SUV's  and other than needless expensive wood species or other non important things to me they have no comparison to the Jaguar F Pace, especially the aesthetics. Their almost as boring looking as the Tesla in my opinion. It makes absolutely no sense rolling out all the extra dough  for Maserati, Porsche, Audi, BMW, Mercedes etc. just to have an ego badge and while looking financially ignorant to be gaudy and showy. The F Pace is a much more sophisticated statement indeed, not to mention the most discrete and best looking car out of the whole bunch. I come from the high end design world who gets scale, etc. and making all types of design statements for the the top 10% of the 1%. And Jaguar hit the nail on the head with the F-pace from aesthetics, to performance, to reliability, and value.

jaguar,f-pace,2018,waldograph, 05/06/2018,Jaguar F-Pace Diesel VS Lexus RX350,5,"This review is for the 2018 F-Pace 2.0 Diesel with 7,000 miles. Absolutely no technical issues till this day. Vehicle made in Great Britain, engine Great Britain, transmission from Germany. We are in early 40‚Äôs, in the garage we also have the 2016 Lexus RX350 made in Canada, and also no majors problems with this vehicle. Wife prefers RX350 because of roomier interior, quieter and softer ride, more luxurious interior feel, high end materials, brave exterior design, best LED headlights in the industry, overall: ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs car‚Äù. l did notice about 80% women are RX‚Äôs drivers.
I also liked RX350, but absolutely love the F-Pace. Best driving vehicle I have ever owned, pure pleasure on the turns. In my opinion best looking in the segment, handles like a sport sedan due to torque vectoring and sport suspension. Accelerates like another brand's gas V6‚Äôs due to turbo charger, and very high torque 318 ft. lbs. Absolutely great all weather performance due to standard Land Rover‚Äôs AWD technology (rear axle based!!). Very sensitive steering wheel specially in Sport mode ‚Äì this vehicle really listens to you and you fully feel the car (Swiss precision). Great navigation system, many great features from 5 year free Jaguar Remote App, panoramic glass roof, large trunk. And absolute segment leader (including Hybrids) 32 mpg city, 38 mpg highway. Very cool movable gear selector knob, and the main thing: British prestige.

Yes, there are small issues I did notice: interior should have more high quality (remember, mine is base model...), auto start/stop don‚Äôt remember your preferences after engine restart, not too roomie and no reclining rear seats (mine is base...maybe because this is sport not family car),  rear and side visibility not to good, and weak base headlights (mine are not LED), mediocre base sound system, unpainted cheep plastic door handle inside, not very pleasant interior smell (mine is artificial leather, maybe that‚Äôs why). 

Quick conclusion: This vehicle is designed for people who enjoying driving, not for family soft and luxury cruising. It has legendary Land Rover off road roots, and the famous handling from Jaguar's long motor sport history. If you are bored of German or Japanese luxury cars, looking for something not thirsty, unique and prestige, handsome and fresh, sporty performing, handling, steering and accelerating, 5 years free maintenance and 5 years b2b warranty, F-Pace 2.0 Diesel is definitely for you. If you have a family, or looking for softer, quieter and luxurious ride, buy RX350. But please remember one thing: on winding roads driving super comfy RX350 you will be slower at least 30 mph.  And last interesting info I just learned about how ‚Äúboutique‚Äù this brand is: Jaguar sold in the whole USA the same amount of cars as BMW sold just in the Chicagoland in the same period of time. Would you like to drive something unique? Thanks for reading, and good luck with your decision!

Took a Road Trip from Minneapolis to Mount Rushmore > The Bad-Lands> Yellowstone>Grand Teton>Arches>Canyonlands and back 3900 miles in 10 days.....an awesome drive with all conditions and the F Pace was brilliant.  The overall handing is exceptional and ride most comfortable and quiet for highways, long hill climbs , steep sharp corners. The acceleration to 80mph ( Western Highways) is exhilarating.

jaguar,f-pace,2018,Joe, 10/12/2017,bad a$$,4,"First SUV that wasn't a Toyota and loving it.  Drove interstate speeds for a long distance and averaged 30mpg in eco mode.  At in town speeds, I sometimes opt for the paddle shifters as the car does hunt for the proper gear on inclines.  The turbo inline 2.0 4 cylinder has not disappointed us in performance and the handling is definitely Jaguar sedan type.  Acceleration is VERY responsive.  The seats hold you firmly on sharp turns and the vehicle holds the road like a sports sedan.  All the cargo room you'd ever want and, while we probably differ from other SUV owners, we like to feel the road and there is just enough with the F-Pace with the 19"" wheels to realize you are on a road and not sitting in your living room on cushy couch.  For us, the amenities and electronics are not distracting and very functional.  We did purchase a set of Worth floor mats to protect the carpeting as we intend on keeping the vehicle for quite awhile and they are well worth the $200.  Jury is still out on cost of ownership but the factory warranty, while not great, is very adequate.  Have had the vehicle less than 30 days and most categories in the rating scheme are N/A at this time.

06/05/18...  A few too many little things that don't work as they should (especially for the price you pay) with technology, climate control, remote start app, door locks.  We have found that it's to our benefit to let the engine warm in the winter as you really get turbo lag if you don't.

The auto did perform really well on an extended trip and the ride was, in our opinion, more comfortable than a Toyota 4Runner.  The gas mileage averaged 27 in the standard driving mode.  The front door opening could be 1-2 inches taller even with the seats pretty back as far as possible.

12/05/18.... Too bad they don't make vehicles nowadays to get from point A to point B without all the ""extras"".  Too many little things can go wrong or don't work as advertised and the really sad thing, the car dealers don't have a clue what the cause of the problem might be nor how to fix it right the first time.  Such was our experience with the F-Pace and Aristocrat Motors in Merriam, KS.  All this finally culminated with us trading our F-Pace after only 12 months of ownership for a more reliable SUV and much better service.  Unfortunately, the F-Pace joins the ranks of overloaded SUV's that todays driver thinks he needs to get from point A to point B.

jaguar,f-pace,2018,Bigcat6, 04/01/2018,Supercharged Luxury,4,"Purchased the 35t Prestige V6. Highly recommend the LED headlights as they project brighter light and throw a greater distance down the road. Overall power, acceleration, traction, handling, ride smoothness, comfort and interior space are top notch. The sound system is not bad and I regularly see over 26 mpg in mixed driving running Eco mode. Heated windshield also helps defrost the front glass quickly and effortlessy on icy winter days.

I had trouble with the ""infotainment"" center and the dealer eventually replaced the car with a 2018 F-Pace since they could not fix it.  I thought it was the first model year and they just needed to work out the issues.  So far with the 2018 F-Pace I started with more problems with the infotainment system, they updated the software and this time it works most of the time, the sunroof cracked (they said a small rock must have hit it-I think I would have heard the rock hit it, but ok), the check coolant light kept coming on, I added more coolant even though the car was not that old,  the light came on again, I called the dealer,  the hoses popped off when I was driving and smoke started pouring out of the hood (I thought the car was going to burst into flames),  they towed it to the dealership and replaced the hoses, the check coolant light keeps coming on, the engine fan runs like a jet engine, they replaced the  water pump, the coolant light kept coming on again, the water pump was replaced a second time, the engine fan makes strange gurgling noises as if something else is wrong....  The letters fell off the back of the car and I was driving a JAGUA  until I took it to the dealer to fix, they replaced the R on the logo and re-glued the rest of the letters so they didn't fall off too .  ,  I sent a certified letter to Jaguar USA and never heard from them.

Either get a killer lease deal on it or go with a Japanese competitor that will give you value for dollar.  "
jaguar,f-pace,2018,RobertW, 04/17/2018,It's all about the ride.,3,"First off, I can't tell you how much I want to like this SUV. Best looking SUV on the road hands down. Plus it's sporty, fun to drive, and just plain cool. But, I simply can't deal with that ride. Smooth until you hit a pothole or uneven pavement, then the impact is harsh enough to knock the fillings out of your teeth. Yes, it's that abrupt and harsh. Very noticeable. I understand it's a ""sport SUV"", but for every day driving in a city full of nothing but horrible road issues (in this case, Houston), it's just too burdensome. I think Jaguar should offer an Fpace model tuned for a softer ride.

jaguar,f-pace,2018,P Back, 12/18/2017,SUV/Crossover most fun to drive,5,"Best looking suv one on the market. No comparison. Bought  S trim with supercharged V6 and 380hp and is super sporty. Same engine as the Jaguar F type. A little pricey but comes with a lot of standard features. Handles great. It really hugs the road. Pick up is great and very responsive. Very smooth  8-speed transmission. Interior very nice and intuitive. If you don‚Äôt want a typical suburb suv that looks the same as most others and want your time on the road not to be boring then consider this car or get the R Sport trim with the V6 340 hp engine. Has most of the options, but not the exceptional feature of configurable adaptive dynamics and adaptive surface response systems for the engine. There are many good cars in competition out there: Q5, Macan, X5, XC 90, GLE 300, etc. Tried them all. None drove as exciting as the F Pace.

So now we have a fun grandma grandpa "" sports car"". Only complaint is the seat belt retract mechanism when using a booster seat.

jaguar,f-pace,2018,Melissa, 07/23/2018,This one is the bomb.,5,"Let's start with the power. You get in and bam this car has great acceleration and power and sips the gas at 28+ mpg. Great ride we were cruising at 90 and it felt like 50. This car goes. Heated and cooled leather seats welcome you.  After a day of driving you feel relaxed and ready to drive some more. This car is a dream to drive.  The full panoramic sun roof is awesome. The car has great visibility and virtual no blind spots. Jaguar uses the meridian sound system that I think  blows away the competition. The navigation system is easy to use and very intuitive. The incontrol apps make remote starting and finding your car after the NFL game easy. Jaguar is spot on with the F Pace. Another winner in my book. We love ours. To add icing to the cake the team at Willis of Des Moines are great to work with,  thanks Todd and Jack for the great experience.
"
jaguar,f-pace,2018,Stanmrvan, 08/27/2019,Love the acceleration!,5,"I have had the F-Pace for a month now, bought it used. It is an exceptional vehicle. It is the 3.0t, so 296bph. Love the Acceleration! comfortable on long rides when you tweak the seat position.
Only improvement if I had known prior to buying I would have gotten the Prestige vs. the Premium I got. It has the additional features I expected in a luxury vehicle. Such as Lumbar and brighter lights. 
The warranty gives me comfort, basically bumper to bumper other than tires, brakes and wipers for 5 years. 
Based on my experience so far, I will trade it in a couple to three years and make sure I get the prestige!
So good, did great on our last 1000mile trip, including high mountain passes.

jaguar,f-pace,2018,alex g, 07/02/2019,Great Mechanics / So-So Appointments,4,"There are a lot of things to like about the car, (I love the styling and performance; not so much premium fuel); but there are a lot of things missing on this model that you would expect to have as standard on a $$ Jaguar.  The seats are ""faux leather"" & dash /inside side panels are plastic; there is no standard satellite radio or CD, and the radio doesn't show the artist or song; the standard headlights are halogen, not Xenon; there is no standard front or rear parking sensors or blind-spot monitor; there isn't even a compass.  Most of these things I have on a 2003 Infiniti FX45 and 2012 Volvo.  ""My bad"" that I expected these things, thought I'd be OK without them, and then discovered how much they are missed after I purchased the car.  I located an ""upgraded"" model that had the things that I wanted that were missing, but was told that my car had already decreased ~$7K in value in three months and I would need to pay an additional $12K for the same year car with the ""extras.""  So I'm deciding whether to ""settle"" or to look into another vehicle altogether.   I really expected more from a brand like Jaguar, and hate that I am so disappointed.

This does work best if you are the first in line at the lights, but I am sure it works wherever you are in the line. Aside from the acceleration it just feels like quality. Equipped with the optional sports seats this is a very comfortable drivers position, giving you such a secure feeling as you turn into a corner it is almost womb like. I really don‚Äôt know where the criticism of the interior is justified, it is not Bentley luxurious but it seems more than adequately solid for this price range.

jaguar,f-pace,2019,DEE, 01/14/2019,Pleather,1,"The seats in a premium Jaguar FPace is like pleather.. For a luxury car that has such a high MSRP I was expecting leather specially that the premium 25t is not their basic model. Also the steering wheel has the same material. When driving it, it sounds like you are rubbing plastic. I also looke at their prestige model and although it had leather seats the steering wheel material was the same.. You will only be paying for the brand not the vehicle interior. Besides that you have to add features that now are basic in cars boosting the price to close to $60,000.. Don't expect to negotiate with the dealer any of the price such as MSRP or selling price because all they want to know is "" how much can your monthly payment be. If you can't pay $600 or more there is nothing they will do.. I loved the exterior but the interior was extremely disappointing. Jaguar needs to make leather standard in all their vehicles.. Maybe another generation for me!! Not worth the asking price.
"
jaguar,f-pace,2019,Rock, 02/25/2019,good technology poor design and comfort,4,"I leased this vehicle. the first and biggest disappointment is the seat. The design is very odd. I have the most advanced seat with all possible adjustments but I can't get it how I want it. It is either sinking in so you cant see the consul or too tight where you knee hits the middle section. very disappointed. The car comes with 360 view but that view doesn't work when the car is in reverse which is when you most need it. Also when you are backing the car up, all other options are deactivated for instance you can not initiate your seat warmer. The engine and acceleration and other engine and technology options work just fine tho.
"
jaguar,f-pace,2019,CTMA, 09/03/2020,A true 'Sport' utility vehicle,5,"Having owned the car for about a year now, I can safely say this is by far the best car I've ever owned. 
I'll start off with the cons: some people would prefer the seat leather to have more softness to it, although the seats are incredibly comfortable, and there are a few hard plastics in the lower door panels. It would be nice if the second row slid forward/aft, but the seat backs recline and there's plenty of leg room, even for my 6'2"" son. Lastly, it would be nice if there were direct buttons for the vented seat controls, as opposed to having to hit two menu functions to access them.
Here's the rest of it, pretty much all good....
It has the handling of my late model Corvette, the luxury of my recent GLS450, and the cargo space of a mid-size SUV. I don't know how any car with almost 9"" of ground clearance can handle as well as the f-pace does. The car seems to disappear around you as you increase speed on a curvy, winding road. Responses are immediate, but never touchy, and there is good road feel and feedback through the steering wheel and controls. The ride is firm, but never rough, and it will stay planted through a bumpy corner even at high speed. We get low 20s around town, and well over 30 on the highway for mileage, and we do drive the car the way it was meant to be driven, so the mileage is even more impressive because of that.
We have the 4-cylinder engine, it's not a rocket ship but it is never lacking for power even with four people and a week's worth of luggage. The Meridian audio system is terrific, the vented seats blow cool air immediately, and the heated seats and steering wheel get very warm. The layout is pretty good, everything is pretty much touch screen based, although there are some hard buttons at the lower portion of the dash.
See comfort is excellent, ours have adjustable bolsters and thigh extensions, and are great for hours of driving. The second row seats are very comfortable as well, and recline slightly. The cargo area is huge, perhaps the biggest in class, and we're never lacking space for week long trips to the lake or wherever we are going. 
This is a true luxury / performance SUV, that handles better than most supports sedans and sports cars I have owned. It's Firm, but comfortable on bumpy roads, and can tackle off-roading and snow and slush equally well, with several drive modes and low speed cruise control for inclement weather or mud. Keep in mind the all-wheel drive system is Land Rover based so it's excellent under any conditions.
I didn't expect to like this car as much as I have. The two tone interior impresses everybody, looks sharp, and as well laid out overall. The exterior is one of the nicest I've seen on any vehicle ever, And although that's subjective, most people tend to agree it's a very good looking SUV.
It's also nice that you don't see one on every corner, my neighborhood is loaded with Q7, q8, GLEs, x5s, and numerous other European machinery, so it's nice not to have something that gets lost in the crowd. anybody looking for a luxurious, but especially fun to drive SUV, owes it to themselves to drive an F-Pace.We looked at it initially just because we thought it was a beautiful looking vehicle, and after driving it we knew it was the one for us.. We will definitely be considering Jaguar products in the future."

jaguar,f-pace,2019,aaalex g, 07/03/2020,Prestige Series / Mostly Great,4,"I upgraded from a 2018 ""Premium"" to a 2019 ""Prestige"" to get some additional features.  The 30t vs 25t makes a world of difference in performance at no real detriment to mileage.  In fact, if you are a careful driver, I've been able to get ~30 mpg in highway driving, not bad for a 296 horses machine.  There are a lot of things to like about the car, (I love the styling and performance; not so much premium fuel); but there are still things missing on this model that you would expect to have as standard on a $$ Jaguar.  The seats are now leather & dash is leather lined; there still is no standard satellite radio or CD, and because the installed antenna is only for radio you are not easily able to upgrade the system to received satellite; the standard headlights are now Xenon -- a big help in nighttime driving.; there now standard front or rear parking sensors -- a great driver assist, but still no blind-spot monitor -- you have to upgrade again for this. All of these things I have on a 2012 Volvo S80.   I really expected more from a brand like Jaguar, but overall love the ""Prestige"" model.  "
jaguar,f-type,2014,Brian, 08/20/2015,"""Bad"" Kitty",5,"I am 6'2"" and most of the ""special"" cars that were interesting to me I could not fit  in.  Two weeks ago I flew from Michigan to South Carolina to pick up my brand new 2014  ( yes, I realize the 2016's are coming out very soon ) F-Type Jaguar convertible, V-6 S, in British Racing Green with dark brown leather with light stitching and a black top.  I fit like the car was tailor made just for me.  I can stretch out my left leg fully, the seat holds but does not dig in ( Porsche ), my line of sight is in the middle of the windshield, not at the upper support bar ( Corvette ).  I drove a V-8 S several months ago and fell in love with the car but as hard as it is for a car guy to say, it was too powerful to be fun.  My car can be driven with some gusto and I can enjoy the amazing exhaust sounds without hitting crazy speeds and likely going to jail.  The middle choice in the lineup was the perfect car for me.  Amazing lines, rare color,outstanding build quality and well thought out driving position and dash layout.   Drove my new ""Kitty"" home (830 miles) straight through and I could not get the big smile off my suntanned face.  Got 29.2 mpg if that matters to any potential buyers running 75 to 85 mph.  It took me a long time to finally decide on my special car.  Spending this kind of money should make you think twice. I sometimes call this my anti-Tesla.  There is a great mix of sophisticated aides and functions but enough great old school DNA to make me think that these kinds of cars may not be build forever in an electric, Google computer driver future.   I feel that Jaguar has built a car that will still put a big smile on my face 20 years from now when I press the orange start button and this car roars to life.   You will want to keep the sport exhaust turned ""off"" until you are out of  your neighborhood, trust me.  The trunk is ""soft side"" overnight bags small but this is a weekend or special use car for most owners and the way the lines of the car work so well together I promise you will not care about the small trunk.  Design over function is ""OK"" sometimes.  Could not be happier with my purchase. Note: perhaps in some areas of the country these cars are more plentiful.  Where I live they are ""Blue Moon"" rare.  Be prepared for lot's of attention.

A year later and no issues at all.  The more I drive my Jag the more that I appreciate the build quality, the design, and the way this car is sorted out.  
We make wonderful drives along the back roads near Lake Michigan visiting the great small  harbor towns with the car and those types of roads are the cars favorite.  Top down driving is something that we thought we would like but actually love.  The sounds and smells along with fantastic views transform a normal ride into an adventure.  
One small issue.  For the money a real spare tire should be included with each car sold.  The owner could then decide to carry it or not.  
Never once have I thought that I had not purchased the right model F-Type.  The middle one is just so much fun to drive, so balanced, very powerful but in a more useable way than the crazy 8.

My 2014 BRG, black convertible top, dark brown interior F-Type Jaguar is over 4 years old now.  Time really does fly by.  I honestly thought that there had to be ""gremlins"" lurking in my car somewhere.  The electrical system, the fit and finish, the driveline, something was going to re-confirm the sketchy reputation for build quality that Jaguar acquired in the past.  The wonderful and amazing realization is that I have had an oil change, first one is on Jaguar and a tiny paint repair on the seem where the body and the rear fender join up.  I understand that this is not particularly uncommon and it is a few spots where the paint is rubbed off and appears as white spots.  Fixed perfectly under warranty last year.  That is it for any repairs or ""gremlins"" and compares well
 with any of our Toyota's or Honda's.  We enjoy using the car but honestly we do not use it as an everyday driver.  A special car for special drives on special days.  Since we live in Michigan it sleeps the winters away from November until May so the total mileage on the car is very low and it goes to sleep on Sunday.

Concerns:  All Jaguars seem to depreciate faster than they really should. Not sure if it is related to a perception of no quality or that they lease too many of them but the issue is real.   We did not buy it for resale but the market value hit the first few years is really significant.  I guess that provides some great values for the second owners .   Wondering when the market will be saturated with people looking for this kind of wonderful experience car but at the expense of everyday practicality.  I am not sure that the market is huge for cars like this. 
 
Twenty years from now we intend to still be cruising along the amazing backroads of Michigan with our car.


Another year, very light use.  No issues of any kind.  Love our F-Type Jag convertible S.  Sleeping now

jaguar,f-type,2014,Paul F., 05/22/2017,My dream car come true!,5,"If you're looking for a relatively exclusive, classy, fun to drive 2-seater sports car that gets attention without looking like you're having a mid-life crisis, the Jaguar F-Type must be on your shortlist. Especially in V8 configuration, you get Corvette-like performance but with classier styling over the track-focused Corvette and more exclusivity over the other usual offerings from Porsche or BMW with similar performance. The F-Type is downright gorgeous with high quality fit and finish. Its 8-speed auto transmission is fast shifting and fun to drive aggressively (you really won't miss a manual) but the real fun is in the sound; everyone who rides with you will be smiling as much as you! Performance is near supercar status (in V8 guise) with the supercharged 5.0L engine rocketing to 0-60 at just under 4 seconds and a top speed north of 180 mph. The V8S RWD is tail-happy so you do have to make sure you are paying attention coming into high speed corners (newer versions like the AWD R help alleviate some of this). Steering response is smooth and immediate. Despite its performance focused suspension, the car still provides a relatively comfortable ride and getting to speed is just plain fun depending on how you want to drive it; think of the F-Type as a cross between a European-muscle car and GT cruiser. Electronics (especially the infotainment system) lags a little behind newer offerings but then I didn't buy the vehicle for infotainment; the real entertainment is in the driving experience as a whole back by the wonderful exhaust symphony. And, if you're patient, low mileage versions can be found at moderate prices (although that is relative too considering sticker prices are typically near or above six figures for a new one with the V8). If you can, find one with the Performance Pack (better seats, 20-inch wheels, bigger brakes with red calipers, etc.) and Vision Pack with Blind Spot Monitoring (to help with cross traffic, parking, and backing up since visibility over and around the car‚Äôs sumptuous curves is limited) along with other packs/upgrades that enhance the ownership, driving experience, and resale value. While long term reliability seems to be much improved offer previous Jaguar offerings, the F-Type is still relatively new so I also recommend investing in an extended warranty that can be purchased from your Jaguar dealership.

jaguar,f-type,2014,Larry, 05/07/2020,Comfortable and exhilarating!,5,"I bought a one owner 2014 with 19,000 miles. Original msrp $105,000. My price illustrates the depreciation of these cars is incredible but the driving experience is unrivaled. The v8 is crazy fast but driven sensibly is very accommodating. A bit heavy and relatively large (wide) car when compared to other roadsters ( I've owned BMW Z4's, Z3,corvette, 300ZX, etc.) and this is as comfortable as any of those and far more exhilarating. #1 fun car!"
jaguar,f-type,2014,Bunch, 12/11/2019,No room to roam,4,"Love the performance..but, big but, absolutely no room for suitcases, golf bags.  So, never a car you can take on a weekend getaway."
jaguar,f-type,2014,rting1, 11/17/2013,"This is the second modern Jag I owned, last one 2010 XKR convertible",4,"Not sure why people will buy V6, unless it's the money issue. V8 has way more power & better sound. A absolute head rush. Unless if you track all the time, otherwise no point to have V6. But again, if you track all the time, you probably should buy a 911. Many people buy Porsche said Porsche is a better performance car but never take the car to track. For me, a sports car is all about style, sound, power and being unique. This is my 2nd Jag, last one was a 2010 XKR convertible. I didn't have any reliability issue at all, don't expect on this one. However, I did have horrible reliability & built quality experiences with Porsche & Mercedes SL55. Jag is the only company that I bought 2 cars."

jaguar,f-type,2014,Jim Lighta, 03/15/2019,Best car I've owned in my 52 years,5,"This car was pricey at $108K, but as an exotic car, Jags aren't driven that much and loads of 2014 V8s can be had in the low $40k's with 10k miles or less.  The Certified Preowned Warranty cars have 7y/100K warranties which are still in effect.  Performance-wise, you can beat the 5.0L V8 RWD, as it is much more powerful (+70 whp over AWD), lighter (-300 pounds) and faster.  The Jag F-Type RWD V8S absolutely buries everything form Porsche in the price range, no Porsche 911 is even remotely competive as they have about 50% less torque than the Jag.  The V10 Audi powered Lamborghini Huran an Audi R8 are utterly outmatched, as the Jag literally leave both like they are standing still, with 100 ft-lbs more torque and similar weight.  Overall, the car is a riot, with an exaust note so gorgeous, they is nothing else like it on the road at any price or age.  Its is simply spectacular.  Watch Matt Morans youtube review or the V8R for a wonderful tour and driving review.  Of note, the Racechip GTS Black is wonderfully reliable and bumps the car to 620 hp and 500 ft-lbs for $750. And a $225 upper supercharger pulley adds  another 30 hp and 20 ft-lbs.  The RWD V8 F-Types are legendary cars that will define the peak of the automobile.

The XKRS has the same motor, same HP and torque but feels so much different. The XKRS you have to drive very carefully or else you will find yourself pointing in the wrong direction.

Great balance of fun and class. A really head turner and amazing exhaust note."
jaguar,f-type,2016,2016JagF-TypeC, 05/11/2016,10+ Months/11k+ Miles Later...,5,"Still in love and yes, extremely fun to drive! Just tinted the windows so it looks bad a** on white. I'll summarize the good and bad I've experienced so far.
Pros: According to trip computer averaging a whopping 25.5 mpg in mixed city/hwy driving. Beautiful interior design and aesthetic layout of controls. My first Jag and everything was very intuitive and easy to learn. Very quick and super smooth gear shifts whether in automatic or using manual paddle shifters. Dynamic mode turns this from a civilized luxury sport car to a hilariously fun roaring ""beast"". Trunk space able to fit all road trip essentials including full size cooler and more. Once you find a good fit the sport seats provide excellent support and fits like a glove. Lovely safety features of the Vision Pack (e.g. blind spot monitor, rear camera, front and rear parking sensors, rear cross-traffic warning, etc.). Security knowing it's covered by Jaguar's ""Best in Class"" 5 yr./60k mi. warranty, scheduled service, and roadside assist. Exceptional VIP customer service from the dealership.
Cons: Technology (e.g. GPS, electronic menu, blue-tooth, etc.) slow and from the stone ages. Experienced one or two minor electronic display glitches. Check engine light at 6k miles from faulty O2 sensor, dealership replaced . Low front plastic air dam annoyingly scrapes bottom all the time. Speakers vibrated on high volume at beginning but problem seems to have gone away now?
I get friendly compliments from people all the time. My best experience is driving with the stereo off just listening to the purr of the active exhaust note or rocking it with the stereo on full blast. I actually get an urge and miss driving it if a few days have passed with it sitting in the garage. Worth every penny in joy and happiness imo!

jaguar,f-type,2016,Steve Miller, 04/10/2018,Warning F-Type VIN SAJWA6AT1H8K38814,2,"Warning for potential buyers of black 2017 F-Type VIN SAJWA6AT1H8K38814. I am the original owner of the car which was bought new in Greenville, SC. The car was bought back from me by the dealer because it has a defect that can't be fixed. In hot weather only, the dash makes a horrible creaking noise. In cool weather it is quiet. The dealer tried to fix the problem more than once, they even tried replacing the dash, finally they admitted they could not fix it. At that time, the plan was to replace the car. Long story short after six months of stall tactics and excuses, they would not replace the car without me having to spend in excess of $10,000.00. No thanks, I know better than to throw good money after bad. Since I had them dead to rights with a potential lemon law case, they agreed to buy the car back for the entire sales price.
After I signed the papers, the sales manager admitted to me that they planned to resell the car as they weren't sure it had a defect. What??? Apparently they are going to claim amnesia when they sell this lemon to an unsuspecting buyer on a cool day when the defect is not evident. Sadly a used car buyer will not have the protection of the lemon law that I had. If you are thinking of buying this car be sure to drive it on a sunny hot day after it has been sitting outside, you will change your mind. If you have bought this car, please contact me (look on Facebook Jaguar F Type fans page for my post). I have the proof you need to get your money back. This dealer is has no integrity whatsoever and Jaguar should be ashamed that they represent them!"
jaguar,f-type,2016,B, 09/15/2016,"Don't think twice, think three times BEFORE BUYING",3,"This is my third F-Type in two months. The first was a ""Certified"" 2014 auto ""S"" with 12k mi., the second was another ""Certified"" 2014 auto base with 40k mi., the third is a previously unregistered 2016 Jaguar executive car with a manual (an ""S"") with 5k miles.   Good:  all three look great. The acceleration with the autos is great...the manual less so.  Bad:  all three had/have defective fuel fillers, defective stereos, squeaks/chirps/rattles/buzzes.  (And the second one had a radiator hose rupture during the test drive...but I still bought it after it was fixed.)  The first two were each in the shop for a week just after purchase due to these KNOWN problems. The dealers admitted they knew there were service bulletins out for these problems, but stated that Jag won't pay them to fix these problems pre-delivery. Each was bought back.  Jag refuses to fix the defective stereos and told me it would void my warranty if I paid the $4k necessary to make it sound good.  No joke:  the $500 Fender stereo in VW's is light years better than the 770W Meridian system, which spews out muffled bass and tinny mids.  The bass is distorted in all of them. Try this:  compare bass at full with sub at zero and vice versa--not much volume from the one at full. Then, put one at full and add some volume from the other:  disproportionate volume increase and muddy distortion.  Then, put them both up high and send the sound to the back:  not much from the subs in back...except for gurgling distortion.  I thought the 2016 models had all of these problems fixed. I was wrong. Shame on me. The present car is a lease and the dealer won't unwind it because the car was never previously registered. I got an amazing lease:  a $96k sticker reduced by $25k, making a first month plus fees drive off with $762/mo. for 33 mo. with 15k mi./year thereafter.  But, if the stereo is so bad, the gas pumps shut off twenty times during fill-ups, and a buzzing erupts when the exhaust button is on loud and the accelerator is depressed between 2,650 rpm and 3,000 rpm, how good a deal is it??  I could go on and on....  Never again an F-Type. Never again a Jaguar.  Just buy a good used 911 and be done with it.

jaguar,f-type,2016,Junk my Jag, 07/01/2017,Extremely disappoited with the vehicle,1,"I've had the car for 10 weeks and it's been in service for half that time. Yes, my new car has been at the service facility for five weeks....and counting! My problems started the first week I had the car; the engine stalled out at a red light and needed to be re-started, the trip odometer has more mileage than the overall vehicle mileage (Strange. Right?) and the vapor lock on the gas tank makes fueling an effort. Then the sbs system was faulty, as the air-bag light was continuously illuminated and the passenger seat became inoperable. Now the exhaust system does not work properly. Parts have been replaced, wiring checked and diagnosing the issues remain a mystery. The car is fun to drive, looks nice and drives well, but owning the vehicle is a hassle, an inconvenience and the worst new car experience of my life. If I could return it, I would. In fact, I want a refund and will gladly go back to my hassle-free Infiniti Q-60S or my Mercedes. Anything.

jaguar,f-type,2016,Scott Johnson, 02/18/2019,Amazing car,5,"I have owned the car (2016 F-Type S convertible with a manual) since new and it now has about 43K miles on it.  It has been utterly reliable.  No squeaks or rattles.  The engine sound is phenomenal and easily controlled.  The manual transmission is pretty good, but I've had other cars with manuals that felt a bit better (a Miata and a Bullitt Mustang).  The Jaguar is quick and intuitive.  I drive VERY fast with great confidence--very few cars can outrun me.  I keep it well-maintained and it looks and drives the same as the day I bought it, which is to say superlative.  It's gorgeous, still looks brand new, still turns heads.  Service has been easy every time.  So far, all service and parts have been free apart from new tires, brake pads, an air filter, and throttle body cleaning.  I had a 911 (997) before my Jaguar and I like the Jag much more--it's easier to drive (the clutch in particular) and the car is far better balanced owing to its front-engine design.  Also, 911s are everywhere and no one notices--the F-Type is beautiful and rare.

jaguar,f-type,2016,Greg, 10/30/2018,This car turns heads,5,"The V6 380HP supercharged engine is quick! The AWD keeps the car stuck to the road.  The 14 way memory seats can be adjusted to fit you as you wish.  The 770W surround system sounds awesome but I like to keep it down a bit to listen to the sounds of the engine.  I smile ever time I step on the gas and hear the car rumble (and that is before turning on the Sport exhaust!).  The front and rear parking sensors and rear camera make parking an ease.  I don't typically drive in rain or snow but have been caught in both and putting the car in Winter mode to shift the power from the rear to the front wheels works great.  All the dials and steering wheel controls are logically placed.  The heated steering wheel is a guilty pleasure. I constantly have people asking me what kind of car it is.

jaguar,f-type,2016,Austin, 03/23/2016,Lots of fun... Sometimes,4,"I got the manual transmission and like the early reviews, the clutch slips... BAD. Getting on the freeway and accelerating with a shift into third? Clutch slips, all the way to redline. And it'll do it all day if you let it. Shift above 5000 rpms? Ditto.
Here's where it gets even better. Jaguar says take it to the dealer
 Dealer says it's normal. Drive slower, don't shift so fast! We'll let you know if Jaguar come out with a fix. Turns out, Jaguar updated the clutch and flywheel part numbers. What for, if nothing is wrong? One owner even had his clutch explode. But Jaguar's covering it up. The rep even acknowledged the problem in the piston heads review. Nobody will do anything!!! $72 grand gets you the clutch that belongs on a Corolla.
Everything else, yeah it's fun. Look great well built, sounds amazing. But who cares if you have to baby it? It's a joke. I wish the auto news sites would help me get through to Jag but nothing yet. Just the same runaround from their customer non-service liars and robots.

Funny how when I'm admiring pics of this gorgeous vehicle online now n suddenly realize oh wait I have one parked down below in my garage lol!
I look fwd to driving this vehicle every day. It is a very driver focussed sports car that demands n engages ur attention behind the wheel. The reviews r all pretty spot on - the firmness of the sport seats may require some getting used to, the interior is quite a tight fit for passengers n the storage space for anything in the cockpit is scant but the trunk is pleasantly adequate n more than enough space to carry any n all road trip essentials. I love all the unique Jaguar signature features from the deployable rear spoiler, door handles, air vents, n folding rearview mirrors, to the cool gear shift missile launcher joystick! Oh n the active exhaust note! It all screams u r driving smthg unique, smthg special, a Jag!
I was originally thinking this would be my weekender or occasional fun car but it is so much fun to drive it has become my daily vehicle n my Audi Q5 has been left sitting in my garage now for days on end! Highly recommended.

jaguar,f-type,2016,Michael, 07/17/2018,Jaguar F-Type R AWD Coupe is a gorgeous monster,5,"With a 550 HP supercharged V8, the F-Type AWD is an absolute beast when called upon, but still a comfortable poodler around town. Perhaps like no other car out there. From 2016 onwards, with the AWD, the R became a car anyone can drive, even on slick roads. Cruising calmly on interstates, it gets upwards of 30 mpg for hours on end. But when provoked by the gas pedal, the R becomes loud, rude, and hilariously explosive. It has been totally reliable, with nothing beyond routine servicing. I've never had another car like it. Makes me wonder what the top-dog F-Type SVR must be like....

jaguar,f-type,2016,Patrick, 10/23/2017,Jaguar's Flagship F type SVR is awful,1,"I bought the car new and brought it back three days later with three separate issues 1) blind spot monitor had failed 2) reverse dip mirror didn't work and 3) electric passenger window didn't work.  I waited two weeks for it to be resolved and when I picked up the car, the exact same issues came back immediately.  Then I discovered that the awful, clunky infotainment ""apps"" and system weren't only crap, they heated my iPhone up to unsustainable levels when connected to the car.  That I was told was ""normal operation"".  Then, the only voice command activated function in the car from JustDrive stopped working and I was told by the app provider that it's T-Mobile's fault, not theirs, and that I'm SOL.  Just this week after 4000 miles the engine light went on and I wasted 5 hours battling though traffic to get it resolved.  It's not just the sub-standard quality of the car, it's Jaguar's utter lack of interest in the experience of their customers that sucks the most.
"
jaguar,f-type,2016,Alex Dimitriu, 08/10/2018,STAY AWAY from Jaguar Land Rover products!!,2,"Let me start by saying that this is probably one of a handful of reviews I have ever posted anywhere on the Internet. 

Previous cars and trade in. Reasons why.
So I have two Jaguar cars. Both 2016 models, one is a XF 35T, and another is an F Type S with automatic transmission and RWD. The cars are stunning on the outside when you compare them with just about anything on the road, south of $150K. As far as interiors go, the F Type I have is fully loaded with their sport seats and extended leather package. It smells great inside, like a leather factory, and the seats and sitting position is spot on for my 6.0‚Äô height. The XF on the other hand has a very plain and unremarkable interior, and I have the version with the vinyl seats, which are horrible and feel like you are sitting on bubble wrap.
The infotainment systems on both cars are really crappy when comparing with all major competitors, and even with Jeep or Nissan systems.
For the XF we traded in a twelve year old E Class. That car had a more buttoned up interior and nicer overall trim but it was time for a change. BTW it had zero major issues outside of maintenance, some front end ball joints, a fuel tank sender and a brake module (this last one was an expensive repair).
As far as the F Type, a 2013 5 Series was traded at 29K miles. That car was completely trouble free. 
Previous dealer experience
When serviced at BMW of Darien in CT, everything was covered, brake pads, tires, wiper blades. The infotainment in the BMW is LEAGUES ABOVE the Jaguar unit, although it was three years older.
Mercedes Benz always provided a loaner on the spot, even when they were repairing a ten-year-old car. They really are on point, the dealer always followed up, and the in / out time when bringing in for service can be counted in minutes.
Local Jaguar Dealer
This local dealer has to be one of their worst dealers although that would be tough to flesh out. When they serviced the XF they left the engine cover just loosely thrown on top of the engine, not pinned down. When the tires got bubbles on the side walls at 12K miles, the dealer said it‚Äôs not covered, and the Jaguar Land Rover North America call center pretty much said the same thing, and said you‚Äôre on your own. Luckily Good Year the tire manufacturer that Jaguar chose as a supplier, gave us a small credit towards the purchase of three new tires. Now we have a car with one older tire, and the same brand and model installed that previously failed because of supposed pot holes. The same roads and pot holes were driven through by me in my previous Porsche 911 with 305 cross section Pirelli tires that never had a side wall issue.
When I brought the f Type for service they said the free included oil change would not be covered this time. They wanted $190 for oil and filter (7 quarts synthetic and a filter).  They said I went over 30 days past the two year mark of the cars‚Äô in service date of June 1st 2016. So, they did the oil change last year (Jaguar Land Rover Freeport) so they knew when the year was up. The car‚Äôs computer warned me two weeks ago, and the app on my phone (Jaguar In Control) did the same. We never received any emails or calls from either the dealer or Jaguar Land Rover that the service was due. I proceeded to make the call for service and was told to come in the following week on a Tuesday morning. They also said that no loaners were available but I can wait for 1.5 hours and they would service and wash the car. When I found out about the oil change fee, I refused that service, but mentioned some trim fitting problem in the interior. After waiting in their waiting room for 1.5 hours, they said that a seat would need to come out and they will schedule me to come back a different time. But to sit tight and the service advisor would return with a date and time. Thirty minutes later he returned with a receipt for $0 that also
 mentioned some 27 point courtesy inspection. No mention of what that entails, and the Jaguar Call Center could not verify either. So I waited two hours there and nothing was done. Not even the follow up appointment. The SERVICE advisor said call next week to get a date to come back, and pointed to my car and said ‚Äì‚Äú exit is that way‚Äù. When I got home I noticed that one of the wipers had broken pieces of rubber hanging out of it. Apparently the 27 point inspection does not include looking at the wiper blades.
Selling at a loss
I am so angry that all financial rationale is out the window at this point. All major losses on a new car happen the first year or two, and the F Type has 11K mikes on it  now. I was planning on keeping it until the warranty expires, but no way I am doing that now. Found a six month old Porsche 911 dealer demo with Certified Pre Owned. Much better dealer network and cars. They will probably kill me on this trade in, but in all honesty I can‚Äôt really blame them. A crap shoot when it comes to the quality or reliability of hat they are taking in when it comes to Jaguar

jaguar,f-type,2017,Jim, 10/03/2016,Wonderful car.,5,"I've only had the car for a month. So my review will be limited to initial impressions. Looks. The car is stunning. I've never had a car that people stop and take pictures of when it's parked. And I've owned some VERY nice sports cars. Sound. The car sounds incredible, especially in dynamic mode with the exhaust in loud. i've always thought Porsche flat-6s sounded the best, but the Jag is darn close. Handling. I'm still getting used to the car, haven't really played around with it with the stability control off. But it has minimal body roll, and very linear (if touchy in dynamic mode) throttle response. It throttle steers well in corners. Power is adequate. Book says 0-60 in a smidge under 5 seconds, and that feels about right. Yes, a new base boxster will about match it for less (I test drove one), but who wants to listen to a Subaru soundtrack. Turn in isn't as quick as my old Boxster, no surprise, but it isn't bad. As good or better than a Z4M Coupe. Braking is nothing short of incredible. I have the performance braking package, and while a bit touchy, stops are extremely short and consistent. Jaguar obviously uses a very soft ""track"" pad, as even a short drive will coat the wheels with brake dust. Which I'm sure means shorter replacement intervals. Ride. Actually not too bad. My car has the 20"" Carbon Fiber wheels (they are really aluminum with some attached CF accent pieces), but it still rides tolerably, I commute 110 miles to a client site twice a month, and the trip is easy and comfortable. (Bear in mind I've owned sports cars my entire life, so my opinion of ""comfortable""  and yours might differ:)).  Visibility. OK, here I need to deduct points. The door sills are high, so it is difficult to see curbs when turning and parking  (I leave plenty of room) and resting you arm on the door sill leaves it at an odd angle. The nose is long, and I would HIGHLY recommend the package with the parking assist. I don't need the backup camera as much, but the front sensors for pulling forward are a godsend. Overall visibility really isn't that bad (better than a new corvette in my pinion). Just the price you pay for form over function. Storage space. a glove compartment, arm rest compartment, and open cubby are what you get up front. Generally all I need, but the rear compartment is rather small, there is a little area that is deeper, but you really are going to have issues with more than a few soft suitcases.  Technology. Oodles. As expected, it has pretty much everything you could want. An awesome sound system, loads of customization for car systems, very good blue tooth integration, you can adjust the side bolsters in the seats (Ok, not really tech, but it is very cool), etc. The navigation system is not very intuitive though. Read the manual before you jump in and try to program in a destination. You're welcome. Reliability. No problems to date. There is an annoying buzz/rattle in the right rear, which might just be the cover for the storage area, I haven't located it yet.  But other than that, nothing of note. Anyway, I'd highly recommend the F-Type. Yes, you can buy cars that perform better for less. But unless you're tracking the car (and driving for track times) you'll never notice the few tenths of a second here and there. You get a stunning car, that sounds incredible, and is a blast to drive. And you won't constantly pass yourself, as you will if you buy a Porsche, Corvette, etc.

jaguar,f-type,2017,Michael, 12/08/2018,Bad Kitty!,5,"Update to prior review:  My F-Type was involved in, what I consider, a minor rear-ending.  It took a less-than 30 MPH bunt to the dead center of the rear bumper.  The bumper wound up with a visible crease down the middle, and the trunk lid, being made mainly of fiberglass, essentially crumbled.  Original estimate for repair was around $6K USD.  However, the dealer-authorized repair facility was concerned the price for repair could go higher, because ""...it's a convertible...""  They wanted to have their special team remove most of the rear hardware and ""bench"" the car on a device that, apparently rare in the U.S., will indicate if the car had suffered a structural loss.  According to the F-Type experts (and, I'm not being facetious or critical of them), the car, because it was a convertible, ""bucked"" on impact, essentially destroying the car.  Price tag to repair ""if possible"" was not pushing $40K USD.  My insurance adjuster's discussion with me included parts of the conversation with the repair facility, including, but not limited to, ""...parts are not possible to get...,"" and, ""...structurally, it's a total loss.""  Apparently, the convertible is something of a weakling on impact.  So, when I rec'v the settlement check, I'm going to research available F-Type coupes from model year 2017, then acquire one.  My previous opinions of the car haven't changed.  It's gorgeous, a blast to drive and better than therapy.  Just not getting another dangerous convertible.  FYI - It had just crossed 6,000 miles on the odometer.  Makes you want to cry...


Be ready for a LOT of attention from on-lookers!  Not always welcome, though (LOL!)...  As another reviewer has conveyed, we've had people: walk up to the car and pose with it; hang out windows of moving vehicles ""cat calling""  and waving frantically; try to goad us into impromptu races; drive around us, taking moving pictures; etc.  The car is super sexy, accelerates like a rocket, handles like a dream, stops on a dime, and has the Voice of God!!  Other car buffs have actually asked us to start the engine just so they can hear what they've read about.  And, let's face it, Ain't nothin' like a Racing Red, top-down Jag on a beautiful day!!  Get one and you can fire your therapist!!!!

jaguar,f-type,2017,Steven, 06/15/2017,Jag F-Type,5,"This car is amazing to drive. Each time you get in the car, you feel like the Pilot of an F15 Fighter Jet.  Putting the car into Dynamic Mode when entering a highway sounds like a Jet taking off with Active Sport Exhaust on. AWD really enables the car to perform at a high level on wet roads.  This is a smart car with Vision package, a little car symbol on the corner of your mirrors lights up when another car is in the nearby lane (prevents any missed blindspots by the driver).  The car has automatic  rain sensors and puts the wipers on at the appropriate speed of the rainfall.  It also has Auto headlights. The car will activate the high beams when needed and senses oncoming traffic from a good distance and shuts them off until the car passes and they are immediate turned back on. Very impressive. Not to mention, this is a very unique car with very few on the road. You will get many, many looks of awe and wonder. People will approach you and want to talk about the car.

jaguar,f-type,2017,Mike Arias, 05/16/2018,Jaguar F-Type R Rules the road,5,"It has a very small trunk.  If you want to drive yourself and two others, don't get this car.  It accelerates like a supercar and gets the same type of MPGs (low).  It is a blast to drive, even if to the grocery store - remember small trunk means not a lot of groceries.  Otherwise, I bought in September from a dealer that was closed most of the month due top hurricanes, so I got the best deal of my life.  I have to watch it like a hawk, because my wife want to drive it and more than once she got out of the house before I did and it was gone, gone, gone.  Its just that much fun to drive and the styling is the best Jaguar has done since the E-Type.  So far, everything works, no problems with reliability.  Not really impressed with the 9 speaker audio system, it kind of rattles, but who cares, turn on the by-pass for the mufflers and music is made the natural way - with a big powerful supercharged V-8.

jaguar,f-type,2017,NY F-Type Lover, 06/24/2017,A dream car - with a stick no less!,5,"Best review I can think of: Driving the other day and this 20 something year old in a Nissan Altima is taking pictures of my car. He is racing ahead, then holding back, then right next to me. At a traffic light, he pulls up next to me and rolls down his window. He apologizes for making an idiot of himself with the photos, but just wants me to know that when he gets home, he is posting the pictures of my car on his Facebook site with the intended caption stating that 'this is my dream car"". That is what it is like to drive a Jaguar F-Type. Oh, and did I mention it has a manual transmission? The color, the wheels, the styling, the butterly smooth action and positive engagement of the clutch and stick...I could go on and on...    

Two years and 17,500 miles later, my opinion on this car has not changed one bit.  I am still head over heals in love with it.  I am however, sorry to report that Jaguar has eliminated the manual transmission option for 2020.  Oh well, looks like I will be purchasing my leased car next year.  If you can find one, buy one!

December - 2019:  I have 23,000 miles on the car and have extended my lease.  The original (summer type performance) tires lasted 20,500 miles and were recently replaced with a set of Continental Extreme Contact DWS06 tires which are giving me a much more comfortable ride, and much help with a recent 1"" snow fall accumulation.  Gas mileage is still stellar at 25mpg.  I am proud to report that besides (no-charge) factory service, there have been absolutely no issues with this vehicle.  Not one single problem - no warranty claims what-so-ever.  Still love it as much as the day I drove it home.

jaguar,f-type,2017,Alex Stoyanov, 10/30/2017,A lemon or a Jag? What's the difference?,1,"This car was the biggest disappointment out of any car my wife and I have ever had. It looks great and drives good but we never get to drive it. Rather than that spend our time calling and leaving messages to various people at Jaguar NA and the dealer to check on repair status with no success whatsoever. The car is on its 5th visit to the dealer's service department and every visit is for more than a week. we leased the car less than 4 months ago and it's been nothing but problems. Water leaks, strange smells, check engine light on all the time, reduced performance issues, malfunctioned gas pedal. You can tell they invested the money in making the car look good but underneath that pretty skin it is a terrible turd. Between my wife and I we've had more than 10 BMW products and neither one of them has come anywhere close having problems like this. On top of that Jaguar NA would not return my phone calls - total lack of customer service. Stay away - buy Japanese or German.

jaguar,f-type,2017,SantaMonicaKeith, 09/21/2017,Worst new car experience in 40 years.,1,"My jag is a lemon. Engine stalls out and dies in eco mode. Transmission goes into park, dash lights go out and the engine stops. No diagnosis, no fix, no clue.  Wiring issue disables SRS system, exhaust, passenger seat, windshield wipers. Vapor lock and fueling problem. The car doesn't recognize its own key. Oh, and the trip odometer has more mileage than the actual vehicle odometer....WHAT?!   I've had the car five months and it's been in service for a total of 7 weeks, and I am still having problems with the engine stalling out. I only have one key. And I'm waiting to find out if Jaguar will replace my 2017 F-Type S convertible with a new, identical, one.

jaguar,f-type,2017,DM, 02/23/2019,American Muscle Car in a Hugo Boss suit,5,"I've owned it for over a year, bought it pre-owned with 290 miles, $40k less than MSRP, and now have over 6,000.  All miles are very hard ""fun to drive"" miles thru canyon roads and track days in Arizona.   Although on the heavier side for its category (3750lbs), the SVR performs extremely well for a GT car, its actually more ""sports car"".   Performance is exceptional especially with the AWD.  Instant power delivery, fantastic grip, good for sub 3.5 sec 0-60 and qtr mile times consistently 11.4 sec.  Interior is gorgeous with the diamond stitching and has proven to be very comfortable for my 5'8"" 180lb frame over 6 hr, several hundred mile drives.  Infotainment...to drivers like me, that's secondary. It does everything I need from Bluetooth music/phone and other controls.  Perhaps dated software compared to others in the category but certainly not what I bought the car for. The real infotainment is the drive-train. Reliability has been a non-issue.  Again, 6k hard miles with zero problems.  Very satisfied with the SVR, and still in love with the looks everyday.

The interior is pure luxury, I could sleep in it.  The exaust note sounds far more exotic than bland Ferraris and Lamborghines, which have an annoying a high pitched zing zing sound.  This Jag ROARS 5x as loud with gorgeous hollow harmonies that rise to the most intense rumbling and thunderous howl in automotive history.  The car is legendary.  10/10, 100/100, whatever the scale, max it out.  I love this car.   Perfect reliability so far and best in class CPO Jag warranty of 7 years, 100K miles.

jaguar,f-type,2019,robert jorrie, 01/25/2019,2019 great car ruined by not testing in sunshine,4,"The 2019 I ordered was to have been my 6th Jag Convertible ... and my 5th car, a 2016 F Type is magnificently nimble, quick and marvelous.  Simply a ""Wonder car"" for a real driver.  But the 2016 infotainment is grotesquely difficult to use ... especially when driving.  There is no way to set up a pattern for radio stations ... and it is a pain to have to switch from Satellite radio band to AM band, Fm or the like ... far too complex when you need to keep your eyes on the road.   Suggest you observe the Cadillac CUE system for one that really works well.   So I ordered a 2019 F Type convertible ... an exact copy of the 2016 car thinking they had to have fixed the problem.  When the 2019 arrived, I dropped the top, pulled it out into the sunshine and the infotainment display turned BED SHEET WHITE and became completely unreadable.  Easy to fix ... nothing but a ""too low"" setting of the color saturation and contrast for the screen.  Jaguar, in spite of it obviously being a software problem, replaced the display... and guess what? ... same problem.      Why don't they listen?      So I refused to buy the 2019 car and walked away.   So awfully Sad.

jaguar,i-pace,2019,CurtSprings, 06/29/2019,After rough start my I-Pace is great,4,"The I-Pace is gorgeous, fast, comfortable and efficient.  After surviving the first few months of software and hardware problems the car has been nearly flawless.  Jaguar released numerous software fixes and other than a few infotainment niggles the car is fine. It's fun to drive and looks amazing. 

Cold temperatures reduced range from 230 to 180 miles but wasn't an issue for me because most of my driving is in the city.

Performance is awesome and after 10 months of ownership I am still looking for excuses to drive my I-Pace.
"
jaguar,i-pace,2019,Maarten v M, 05/26/2020,Much much better car that most people think...,5,"First off, the I-Pace is my first EV car and before buying it, I did a lot of research on this type of car, including competitors like the Tesla Model 3 and Audi Etron. The Etron disappeared first from my list. High weight, relatively poor performance, high consumption and actually quite boring.
The Model 3 was a more difficult choice. It's a smaller car but also cheaper, has the Tesla ring to it and is of course full of gadgets. It also was the best selling car in 2019 in my country (Netherlands). Which means, you see it everywhere. Pros were high efficiency, expected good resale value, OTA updates. Cons were a rather bland interior, lesser build quality and, IMHO, rather boring looks. However good the car is in itself, it has become the T-Ford of EV's by now and for me, that's not necessarily a plus.

Then the I-Pace. I find the I-Pace strikingly good looking. It's not a real SUV, more of a crossover. The interior is roomier than you think, thanks to a very long wheelbase. It's a ground-up EV design with a few quirks which don't bother me too much.
I had a chance to test the car for week to see if it would fit my life style and it did. The 1-phase charging is a minus, but after six months of ownership, it has never been a problem for me. I drive about 750-800 km every week, but even then the 1-phase charging has never been an issue. My daily drives routinely are often 200-220 200, so that leaves plenty of time for charging. The fastcharging speed of 100 kW can only be reached in specific circumstances, more likely you will see something like 80-90 kW for a while which will taper off above 55%. But in 17000 km (11000 miles), I have had to fastcharge only on international trips so far.

The I-Pace got a bad reputation for having a very short range just after it was launched. That was due to a combination of faulty software, a First-Edition model with 22"" wheels and all goodies, which reduces range a lot, and a launch during the winter.

I purchased mine in November 2019 and have received several updates since then. I bought the Business Edition S-Model, a combination of S and SE-features not sold anywhere else. Did choose the 18"" wheels for the longer range though.

During the (mild) winter, my average range was 350-370 km (218-231 miles) on a full charge. Now temperatures have gone up (May 2020), the range has improved to 430-450 km (268-281 miles). I have set the Regen to High on the I-Pace and that makes one-pedal driving a breeze. Once you have accustomed yourself to that it's make for a very relaxed drive and it will increase your range.
All around, it's consumption is similar to that of the Tesla Model S up to 70-75 mph (112-120 kph). Above that, the larger frontal area and higher drag will increase consumption more than that of the Model S (being a lower, sleeker sedan).
High speeds will eat up your range very quickly of course and will reach 45-55 kWh/100 km (72-88 kWh/100 miles) if you really go all out as I did on a high-speed trip on the German Autobahn in January. The I-Pace real top speed is 208 km/h (130 mph), and can get there very quickly if you hammer it. 

The I-Pace has been a excellent drive with zero problems. Very quiet, very comfortable yet fast when you want it to be. Build and paint quality is very good, so squeaks or rattles anywhere.
The lay-out of the cabin is very good, the screens have good visibility but need cleaning quite often. I keep a microfiber towel in the car for that, but this is typical of touch-screens in general. The infotainment system could have been a little faster but functions well.
Voice control sometimes has difficulty understanding me. Smartphone connection has been flawless, although when I drive with my wife I have to be quick to make sure the car connects to my phone and not hers.

The I-Pace is very quick car and has no problem with with almost all ICE-cars except high-end
 sportcars. And the faster EV's of course. It also handles very well considering it's size and weight. Only on twisty roads will you find the damping becoming over taxed. This is mainly because of the suspension setup, which is aimed at comfort, not ultimate speed. I find the trade off well worth it. Despite its capabilities, the I-Pace invites you more to a relaxed style of driving that trying to set a new A to B record. 

Trunk space has been more than enough for me, my wife and our two small kids (3 and 1). The frunk in the front stores little besided the cables and a first aid kit. But when driving alone, I keep the cables in the trunk for easier access.

In all, the car has been an extremely good experience and I have no regrets buying it. Am actually happy I did not get the Model 3, seeing it on just about every corner by now.

Update Nov-2020:
The I-Pace has now done 29000 km/18K miles and still going strong, With temperatures  dropping the range has decreased but I am still getting 400 km or 250 miles on a full charge.
Car has had no issues whatsoever.
Very happy owner!

jaguar,i-pace,2019,Jaguar I-Pace Owner, 01/12/2020,I-Pace: WOW! Just know what to expect!,5,"I‚Äôve been thinking about an EV for some time, and my Jaguar XF lease was ending.  I was able to get into an 2019 HSE spec demo model that was nicely discounted.  I think the best deals are on 2019 gently used models from a Jaguar dealership, where you can still get the Federal Tax credit of $7500, and you have an option to lease or purchase.  

The I-Pace is one of the most beautiful cars I have ever driven.  The fit, finish, and technology are far superior to the 2017 XF.  The HSE trim level gives you just about everything you need and want in this luxury vehicle.  The best thing about this car is how it drives!  Wow!  Great combo of power and handling makes it a joy to drive.  The compact size makes it easy to maneuver, while giving me just as much, if not more room that XF sedan.  

Now for the expectations.  Research and know what you‚Äôre getting into before you buy or lease.  The range and charging times will not make it easy for long road trips.  The range will get worse in cold weather and more aggressive driving, and you‚Äôll end up planning your commute and trips more carefully to avoid range anxiety.   It‚Äôll be hard to own this car without installing a home 240V charger.  Take a few minutes and call a couple of electricians for quotes, and it will save you hundreds of dollars than if you went with the Jag recommended installers.  The vehicle doesn‚Äôt come with a spare tire, and you‚Äôll probably want to get a tire inflation repair kit (about $50).  You can buy a spare from Jaguar, but there‚Äôs no place to store it, and it‚Äôll take up space in the back.  

Lastly, if you go to review and comparisons, there will be endless reviews, and particularly comparisons with Other EV‚Äôs like Tesla, Audi, and the upcoming Mercedes.  The two things that sold me on this I-PACE was the beautiful design and the handling/drivability.  If you‚Äôre considering a vehicle in this segment, you really should consider it as an option.

jaguar,i-pace,2019,Richard de Forest, 07/02/2019,I LOVE I-PACE!,5,"Yes, Edmunds didn't have the car they were test driving in the correct regen braking setting! In HIGH REGEN the car responds perfectly with true one pedal driving. You let off the 'gas' pedal and it dramatically slows down to where you need a faint tap on the brake to come to a full stop. When I drive my wife's MBZ 300 GLC the difference in both power and braking is striking. Driving the I-Pace is like BUTTER on the road; smooth, it sticks to the road like marmalade on toast and the acceleration  AT SPEED is a jolt!
However, driving in the ECO setting, when I need a charge I consistently peak AT 257 MILES per charge!!

jaguar,i-pace,2019,Luxury Owner, 05/19/2019,"I love this car so much, I may get another!",5,"UPDATE: At 11000 miles, still loving this car.  No major issues.  The best EV on the market.  The best car on the market.

This car is fast, smooth, stylish, cutting edge, sexy, comfortable, quiet, smooth, grippy, offroad capable, unflappable, efficient, and awesome in essentially every single way.  The Edmunds reviewers needed to put the car into high-regen mode to get one-pedal driving and smooth braking.  The car cuts through traffic like a shark on steroids.  You will hit 105 without even realizing it.  At that speed, the I-Pace is rock steady, quiet, and just plain delicious.  The self-driving feature takes the strain off traffic and long-distance travel while still keeping you alert.  The long wheelbase and short length mean tons of interior space and an excellent ride.  The air suspension lifts so you can hop the curb in the urban battlefield or ford a stream as you see fit.  Then it can lower to let grandma in easily.  Downsides?  It's expensive, but not for what you get.  This is the best car I've ever driven or owned.  BMW and Mercedes ain't got nothing on this Jag.  Tesla?  Go read the horror stories on Tesla Motors Club.  There are several new ones every single day, and they keep getting worse.  The only coming competitor is the Taycan, and that not only will be more expensive, it won't have the versatility of a crossover.  EQC?  EQSlower and smaller inside, because it's a GLC, not a bespoke EV platform.  The same goes for the Audi eTron.  Worried about range?  If you can afford an I-Pace, you can afford plain tickets.  Worried about charging?  You plug it in at night and it's full the next day.  Don't be a fool sitting at a Supercharger, bragging about how you saved $10 by spending 60 minutes in a parking lot.  BEST. CAR. EVER.

jaguar,i-pace,2019,PinballJohn, 05/09/2019,Fun to drive electric luxury cross-over,5,"I am thrilled with my I-Pace HSE. I'll admit I was a bit leary and waited to buy for nearly a year to see what kind of complaints earlier buyers made. I am a long time Tesla Model S owner and think this Jag meets or beats it in every way except for the Tesla supercharger network that is handy for long drives. But if you use it for just daily commutes the way I do, the range is more than adequate and the creature comforts are better. Android Auto/Apple Play was a big attraction for me, because I much prefer using Waze to Tesla's native navigation.  I have come across no build defects at all. I get occasional Android Auto glitches but that happens in my other cars as well. This is really a great car and I'm very happy  so far.
"
jaguar,i-pace,2019,Davelv, 07/17/2019,Misses in several aspects,4,"While the I-Pace is a nice car, it has multiple design flaws.  No spare tire space even though runflats aren‚Äôt offerred.  Only 7.2 kw home charge and real life 84 kw CCS on the road means much longer times to recharge than E-tron or Teslas.  Regen breaking set at high is unusable for most people. Significant tire noise from all corners as well as electric motor whine.  Road imperfections come through for a bumpy ride.  Push button gears is not intuitive and requires looking down.  AC was slow to cool interior on a hot day.  At $89000 these issues shouldn‚Äôt exist.

jaguar,i-pace,2019,Traveler1t, 08/23/2019,I-PACE braking is terrific,5,"Your review is wrong, or, since they built the car you tested they fixed the problem. I bought a 2019 I-PACE in July 2019. I have the heavy regenerative braking option selected. I hardly use the brake pedal and drive almost exclusively with one pedal. The stopping power of the regenerative braking is more than enough for 90% of my braking situations. If I need emergency braking the brakes are very responsive and smooth. The car is terrific and underappreciated by the media. The power comes on quickly, quietly and acceleration is as fast as my Porsche Macan Turbo. The interior is luxurious as you would expect from a Jaguar. Great digital screens, but with just enough physical buttons to keep you off of the touchscreen when driving. I've had over 60 cars in my lifetime, including many Mercedes, Porsches, corvettes, and Jaguars, and this car is the best so far.

Update: a year later with the car and I'm as high on it as I was when I wrote this review.

jaguar,i-pace,2019,Glennsmooth, 02/20/2019,More exciting than a corvette!,5,"Well maybe just a tad under the excitement level of a z06 but this is really an incredible first attempt by jaguar to give tesla a run for its money.  I have the First Edition which is fully loaded with some great tech.  The only real tesla-request gimmick would be a spotlight jaguar logo that is cast upon the ground and various lighting color selections for your interior mood lighting.   Power delivery is incredible and it will beat a 100D from a standstill.  Personally I like the external styling and interior much better than alll electric vehicles currently available.  I have already used the foot-gesture to open the rear hatch with both hands full of groceries.  It works great!   The only downside I see thus far is the infotainment center controls.  The interface looks great visually but is laggy and rather disorganized.  I‚Äôm sure Jaguar will fix this with some over the air software updates.     Mileage will vary.  I live in a mountain area and I get about 200 miles to a full charge on eco mode.  In performance mode and blasting off at every stop light reduces total miles significantly.   Overall I LOVE this car/sub/crossover and my z06 is seriously getting jealous sitting in the garage.  Oh and the self driving mode is excellent!   It maintains center of the lane and auto-stops and accelerates nearly identical to a tesla.  Very impressive!

jaguar,i-pace,2019,David, 08/11/2019,"Smooth, powerful and luxurious",5,"I‚Äôve had my IPace for 6 weeks now and really love it. The power is addictive. Nothing is faster and the acceleration is smooth and steady. Unlike a Tesla, the IPace is truly luxurious.  There is so much tech in this car that I am constantly amazed at all it can do. I love that it reads incoming text messages to me in a British accent. And the phone app works great. I turn on the AC from my iPhone a few minutes before leaving my office and the car is cool when I enter.  I also like that I can unlock or lock the doors using my app.  Everyone wants to look at it. My car is always parked up front when using a valet and I‚Äôve had a couple Tesla owners come over to admire it. A couple of quirks... their is no way to cover the panoramic sunroof so the car gets crazy hot in the summer. And I find that the mileage estimates are all over the place. For a while the car was recording 201 miles at full charge, which is the winter setting (it is now summer). Then it corrected itself and now reads 282 miles. I can watch it drop 10 miles then go up 10 miles a minute later. But, I look at battery percentages so after a while this doesn‚Äôt matter. Overall, so happy. One bit of advice, skip the Jaguar recommended EV charger installers. They never responded and after my complaints they told me they would send one guy to give an estimate (it says you get 3 quotes). I gave up and called a local electrician who was one third the price. Bought a ChargePoint charger on Amazon and signed up with my local utility EV rate plan to reduce costs (overnight charging is practically free). Love this car!

jaguar,i-pace,2019,Susan Kirst-Millspaugh, 09/21/2020,Buyer Beware!,1,"Buyer beware‚Ä¶my 2019 I-Pace blew up! I purchased my 2019 I-Pace in February of 2020. From day one, the car would not hold a charge. The car was delivered to me, left the dealership 100% and within 60 miles the charged was already down to 40% charged. I had the car in the shop several times from February to June, with no solution. I scheduled the car to go back into the shop in June, but in the meantime I left for a trip and parked the car  in the airport covered garage. 5 days later, someone walking by the car noticed smoke coming from under the hood and alerted airport authorities. The airport fire department responded. They used a heat sensor on the car and found a hot spot. When they opened the hood to shut off the battery, the car exploded into flames. Other than an apology call and an offer for free stay at the Lo Posada in Santa Fe (where I live!), I have received NO support from Jaguar International.  Jaguar International did  called me within an hour of the fire.  Not to help me, rather to say they were there to help, but in fact they were doing damage control.  They played me.  They asked that I work with them, which I did.  They asked questions like why did I have my back seat down.  From moment 1, I complained about the batteries.  I gave them all zero‚Äôs on the satisfaction surveys. The only thing they cared about was their image.  The car is beautiful, but like Tesla, which does stand behind their product, there are battery issues. Buyers should be aware before they step one foot into a Jaguar dealership, Jaguar doesn‚Äôt stand behind their product."

We would really like to have the fully automatic steering wheel adjustment rather than the standard manual that is all that's available.  I.e. No option for electronic operation.  We also wish it had a bit more legroom in the rear.  And we would like to have a Tesla-Like network of charging locations.  Until that's available (if ever!) we'll have to use our SL Mercedes for road trips.  No problems thus far although we did have the charging handle stay locked into its socket even when all vehicle doors were unlocked (?).  We simply used the under-hood release to resolve this issue.  We're hoping it does not recur.  Except for the manual steering wheel adjustment issue, the other items on our wish-list are not deal-breakers by any stretch.  If things continue as they have to this obviously early point in time, we will continue to be delighted!  NICE RIDE!

The intelligent braking system will randomly apply the brakes while driving.  The dealership has no idea when or if the may be able to fix it.  The air conditioning and defrost has never worked.  All they can say is they are taking direction from the factory.

jaguar,xe,2017,BrendonSF, 08/07/2016,BMW and Audi Take Note,5,"After months of research and serious consideration of the latest competitive offerings from Audi and BMW, I pulled the trigger on a V6 XE R-Sport two months ago. So far, no regrets. Jag has nailed the balance between athleticism and luxury, despite having 19"" rims. The car is quiet and rides impressively well given the level of handling it offers. Styling, while subjective, is in my opinion above and beyond what the competition is offering. The Cadillac ATS has a better looking interior, but an inferior infotainment system. The Jag might have some cheapened aspects to the interior materials that are a let down, but it's still a very cool and rather unique setup. Passengers take note, and feedback has been very positive. People often comment that it ""looks so luxurious,"" a comment that catches me off guard every time. The brakes have major bite, and the V6 is capable of acceleration that at times is borderline scary. It's as rewarding to drive in the twistiest as any vehicle I've driven. Body lean is non-existent, even when you're pushing traction limits. Quite impressive. I believe this is the best looking, and best performing vehicle in it's class. You can go buy a BMW 340i, get another 1mpg and 0.2 seconds shaved off the run to 60mph. It's a great machine, but you'll also pay about $5k more, and look like every other car on the road. The Jag isn't perfect, but it's a lot of car for the money and backed by the best warranty and best dealership service in the business.

jaguar,xe,2017,E. h., 05/29/2016,Great car! Still has jaguar quirks,4,"It's been a year and the car is still great!  Some things are still minor annoyances (can't change presets from steering wheel, no heated seat button-screen only) but is drives beautifully 



ive owned the 35t for a week and if you're looking for a high performance sport sedan, this is your car! 
The only complaints are limited to some of the interior functionality:
Front parking sears don't work unless you push the parking button each time you're getting ready to park
Steering wheel Radio controls are very limited
Presets are by band (am/fm/Xm) and can't be combined 
Heads up display is very basic when compared to other models and doesn't even project well
Auto stop start setting defaults back to active every time you start the car
Phone controls limited from steering wheel

That said, floor the gas and the problems are forgotten!   Also the voice recognition for phone dialing is faster and more accurate than Siri.

jaguar,xe,2017,Matt, 06/28/2016,A loyal 3-Series Fan...Converted to the cat...,5,"I recently replaced my e90 BMW 328i and have been a loyal BMW fan for years. Since time began to approach for a replacement I basically assumed I'd just walk into my dealership and pick out my next 3 Series. This was especially true since the wonderful turbo-charged straight-six of the 340i was within my budget. But, here I sit with my new Jaguar XE R-Sport 35t and have no regrets. This car is in an entirely different class from the competition when it comes to driving enjoyment. It's a tight nimble car with great steering feel that is exceptionally fun to drive in all situations. The supercharged 3.0L V6 pushes it's power to the wheels eagerly and immediately at any speed and the 8-speed ZF transmission is wonderfully responsive, especially when the car is in it's Dynamic setting. I drove the BMW 340i with the M-sport package, the new 2017 Audi A4, Cadillac CTS with the twin-turbo V6, and the Lexus IS F-Sport before I made my decision and none of these cars could match the Jag for the overall driving package. Some could best it in one area or another but the overall package of power, precision, fun-to-drive factor, and refinement couldn't be topped. Add to that the fact that the Jaguar is beautiful both inside and out, equipped with enough technology to at least be in the middle of this pack of cars, and rides smooth and quiet and the decision was an easy one.

jaguar,xe,2017,Jacob Mathias, 08/28/2016,Love my first jag,5,"I was worried ordering this car and then waiting 4 months, but the xe is one bad a** car. It was worth the wait. Its really fun to drive, the steering, suspension, and quick acceleration satisfy all the urges. Its easy to say this is the best car Ive ever had in this class. I was also surprised by the upgraded media and screen package, i thought it would be worthless like most but its not a tesla screen but definitely an upgrade and a lovely wide screen. I think the only issue i have is the back isnt incredibly spacious but its enough to fit my car seat back there so im happy enough.

jaguar,xe,2017,kjgood15, 02/27/2017,Jaguar XE - the modern successor to the 3.8 Mark2,5,"Let‚Äôs deal with Edmund‚Äôs review first:  ‚ÄúDisappointing interior materials and construction do not stack up to the segment norm.  
The 2017 Jaguar XE's cabin features an attractive, uncluttered dashboard with clean lines, but it lacks the sort of visual flair that made the original Jag XF and current XJ so special. Its quality also leaves a lot to be desired. Compared to what's in its German luxury sedan competitors, the door trim looks and feels a bit flimsy, the trim that wraps around the dash is unremarkable, and the dash top itself is shiny and a bit coarse. Our test car also had more squeaks and rattles than usual, and in general, the XE's cabin feels as if it belongs to a nice midsize family sedan rather than an entry-level luxury one.‚Äù

Let me state that I don‚Äôt know what on earth they are talking about ‚Äì possibly drinking the BMW Kool-Aid too much.  Nothing in the XE interior looks or feels flimsy.  I have driven several current BMW 3-series examples, and also have my wife‚Äôs (costly) BMW X-3 as a direct comparison.  To say the XE lacks in quality, assembly, materials or even visual appeal compared to them is absurd.  Frankly, not much to choose from or any significant differences between these models.  Having driven my XE for 3K miles now, on very rough Western PA roads, I have no squeaks or rattles.  Everything seems extremely solid and well-screwed together.  And ‚Äúdash top itself is shiny‚Äù?  What did you guys do ‚Äì spill a drink on it?  My dash is not the least bit ‚Äúshiny.‚Äù  It makes me wonder if Edmund‚Äôs drove some beaten-up early press-car for their test.  In short, I think their interior assessment is hogwash. And BTW, of course the XE‚Äôs interior is not as remarkable as the XF or XJ ‚Äì would you expect it to be, since those cars occupy a much higher price point?      

The car is very fast, light on its feet, and with a superior ride/handling combination than the BMW 3 series.  In normal conditions, it performs and handles like a RWD car, and its limits seem very high.  Actually, it is quite tossable, handling with a responsiveness and confidence that is reassuring.  The 8-speed auto transmission is a great one, and paddle shifting is fast and smooth if you want to do things manually.   I appreciate the ‚ÄúDynamic‚Äù and ‚ÄúSport‚Äù modes especially, which make a noticeable difference in shifts and throttle response.  Steering feel is surprisingly communicative for an electric system.  Brakes are strong, as you would expect.  I have driven the XE several times in winter conditions, and the AWD traction system performs flawlessly.  

I find the clean and sleek looks, especially with optional 19‚Äù wheels, to be compelling. Thankfully, when Jaguar convinced Ian Callum to jump from Aston Martin, he brought his superior design sense with him.  The fact that A-M made some of the most beautiful cars in the world under his guidance, and Jaguar now has adopted a similar understated but handsome design language is not a coincidence.  While BMW pretty much rehashes the same themes year after year (with the exception of the bizarre Chris Bangle era) and other luxury makes like Lexus have just plain lost their minds in overblown design elements, Jaguars look clean, fast, well balanced, and fresh.  The trick of course will be if they can progress in the years to come without being too derivative. 

Overall, to me the XE is a more appealing car than the 3 series BMW, and unlike  Jag‚Äôs previous 3-series contender ‚Äì the ill-fated X-type ‚Äì it represents true competition.  One cannot be faulted for picking a BMW 3, since there is much to offer there.  After two BMW 135‚Äôs, which I enjoyed, I got spooked off BMW due to the bad electrical gremlins I experienced in both cars.  Yes, Jags had something of a reputation for such issues, but seem to have turned a corner.  I guess I will see.  But in an Jaguar XE to BMW 3 comparison, at the current
 development of both, the Jag was the clear winner for me.

jaguar,xe,2017,steven, 01/04/2018,"It has the ride you would expect from Jaguar, but",3,"First off I will tell you I love my Jag. The ride is the combination of sport and luxury. You hit the gas and the tubo 4 banger takes off. The design is classy and sporty. Comfortable in the cockpit, Not really  sure   about back seat as we have no children. The interior is laid out for easy access for the driver. I have the basic model so I expected to have some compromise, that being said, I think they cheeped out on some basics. No sat radio that is a standard on even your basic Masda. I don't like the Americanizing of the lights, the do not go off when you turn the car off  like all European cars. There is no garage opener built in. No mute button. The radio could be better quality. I think they are over compensation for the mistakes they made with the xt. They put a lot of luxury things in the xt and sold it at a loss hoping folks would then trade up , but instead, continued with the xt. So this time they left out stuff so you would trade up for more luxury. Don't get me wrong this is a super car and I love it, but the lack of some basics my turn some people away. After almost a year with the car I still basically  love the car, that being said, I still am annoyed about the lack of basic applications that are standard on lesser models by other manufacturers. Also the more I look at the nav screen  it seems cartoonish, not classy graphics like you would expect from Jaguar.

jaguar,xe,2017,Fairview, 11/01/2019,Do your research,4,"I usually find that I enjoy my purchases much more after I've done a tremendous amount of research on something. Whether it's a vacation, new piece of tech, or an automobile, research is the key to managing a healthy expectation vs. reality ratio. 

Many of the complaints that I've been reading about on here were easily avoidable if people did their research. 

Space - this is mentioned in 90% of the reviews of the Jaguar XE and shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. The back seats are some of the smallest/tightest in its class and the trunk is probably the tiniest. But it will still hold enough for a long trip or drive to the airport.

Interior - again, this was mentioned in just about every review I came across. The interior is not as good as some of the Mercs I've owned in the past and there are some cheaper materials used here and there. Still, everything works and the tech is more than sufficient.

Performance - this is the reason I ended up purchasing this car. I have owned two C-Class sedans and was always a little underwhelmed when driving them. Sure, they were comfortable, looked nice, and had some great features but I wanted a sportier ride. For this price point, I don't think there is a better option in the entry-level lux sport sedan class.

In the end, it comes down to personal preference. If you're looking for an exhilarating ride every time you drive, this might be your vehicle. If you're not overly concerned with performance and place value in comfort and gadgets, then the C-Class is probably a better fit. Want a little of both - the BMW 3 Series is sure to deliver.

jaguar,xe,2017,First Time Jag Owner, 02/19/2017,LOVE my Jaguar DIESEL,5,"I only buy diesels because I plan on keeping a car 12  or more years and a diesel is the only way to make that happen.   I had three VWs before the Jag.  Before the VWs I had a 2002 Ford F250 Crew Cab. I started with a 2012 VW Golf TDI.  Had an accident (not my fault) that nearly killed me, literally.  So I upgraded to a 2013 VW Passat TDI.  Got rear ended twice, not my fault.  Car was curse so I got a 2014 VW Passat TDI that VW had to buy back from me.  Used myhopstoch dot com because Edmunds and Truecar told me to pay $1 OVER MSRP.  Auto Trader gave me a cert to pay $700 OVER MSRP.   Hopscotch saved my $8K.   So about the Jaguar, love it!   The Jaguar website is a little misleading.  It says the 20d Premium has everything the 20d has, like SiriusXM.  Mine did not come with, so I have a mess of wires and because the roof is aluminum, the magnet won't stick.  The car halls ass.  I was doing 95 on the highway in the middle of the night and would have sworn I was doing 70.  The car comes with four driving modes, rain/snow (starts in second gear),  Economy, Normal, and Dynamic.  I love Dynamic.  The speedometer and RPM gauge turns red like it is angry.  I'm averaging 42 mpg city and highway. The Jag comes with not only a 5 year/60,000 mile bumper to bumper, but also comes with all scheduled maintenance for 5 year / 60,000 miles.  The free maintenance is a few grand in savings.  I'm not tall, so it gives the back seat more parking room.  If you are tall, that will take away space from the back seat passengers.  As far as the technology, I'm good with it.  Had a great mapping system.  My only complaint is it doesn't like my Texas accent.  If I had to add/change anything, first I would put a place for the keys!  I have lost the keys in the car and had to search around for them!  I'd like something between the inside edges of the front seats to prevent things from falling under the seat.  Jag needs to add a few options to all models, like proximity key entry. I loved walking up to my VW and just opening the door because my keys were in my pocket.   The car has a 12v port in the drivers cubby in the center console.  Since you have to run some wires out of it, it needs notches in the cubby lid for the wires to get through.  The apps are okay.  The remote app is the one I use the most to make sure I locked it and rolled up the windows and start it to pre-cool the car down.  In Texas we don't let them run to heat them up, we run them to cool them down before we get in!  The trunk room is more than adequate.  As far as the apps, you have to run them through your phone into the car.  It is easier to just run any apps thru the blue tooth from the phone.  No sense in running the app through my phone into the car entertainment system.  It just adds a step that isn't necessary.  It should come standard with SiriusXM.  SiriusXM are fools for not allowing that and giving a three month trial.  The vision package is very cool.  I have the cold weather package that I will be able to use a few times a year.   The front seats need some lumbar support adjustment pillows.  I absolutely love the car.  I can tell when I change it to dynamic mode.  The steering tightens up, the suspension gets stiffer and it moves.  I was doing 98mph and getting 57 mpg according to the car computer.  I'm averaging 42 mph in mixed highway and city use.  Jaguar know how to make you feel special.  I got a box from them.  It had all sorts of different little panels on the use of the infotainment system and four tire stem caps with little jaguars on them.  I must admit, it made me feel special and like they cared.  I have breakdown and SOS buttons and I think I have them for at least 5 years.  I wanted a diesel. Chevy couldn't tell me when the Cruze was coming out and now I'm glad.  This may be a sedan, but drop it into dynamic mode and it is a sports car!  Have 2500 miles on it
 and not a single problem.  I love that there are two 12 volt ports in the rear of the driver cubby for use by the back seaters.  There is also one in the trunk.  I absolutely love this car!

jaguar,xe,2017,Dennis B., 10/19/2017,"I love driving this car, but...",4,"After many years of BMWs and Mercedes, I wanted a change so I went for this Jaguar XE. A couple of test drives convinced me and I've been thoroughly enjoying it since this past January 2017. I'm leasing the R-Sport, Caesium Blue, black/blue interior, black wheels and detailing. The car is gorgeous! I constantly get compliments and thumbs-up from approaching drivers. I love the exclusivity of the brand as I see all the BMWs and MB on the road around me. I'm 66 and in excellent shape, but the entrance/egress can still be a bit uncomfortable, but once I'm in the car, I don't want to leave. The seating positions are extremely comfortable, fabulous suspension, grabs the road and doesn't let go, and has exceptionally responsive acceleration. Fair gas mileage for a V6 that drives like this, up to around 22.5mpg.   BUT... the interior lacks design and aesthetic ""importance,"" as well as quality materials. One example; the shift levels, mounted on the steering wheel, are thin short black plastic surfaces, as though an afterthought. The very narrow opening of the sliding sunroof was a huge disappointment for me. The biggest problem with this car is side visibility. It's great that the car has signals in the side-view mirrors when a car is approaching, but without it, you're dealing with a death wish. The design of the thick seats and headrests and the wide side pillars make it virtually impossible to peer over your shoulder on either side to see what's around you. Next, small things to me... very little space to store items; the rotary drive knob is too prominent, and eats up too much plastic space; a few electrical glitches that haven't caused any problems (yet). Overall, you wouldn't touch a comparably-equipped or performing BMW, Audi or MB for this price. I have no regrets, and I look forward to my next Jaguar when my lease expires. Hopefully, they'll figure out some of these redesigns.
"
jaguar,xe,2017,D.Rust, 08/31/2018,"Some great, some questionable traits",4,"Almost into to the second year on my leased 35t AWD Premium model. Mixed emotions but overall I still love the car. I Love the engine, handling/suspension, steering, transmission, basically everything involving the driving experience! Now I will say I would never buy this vehicle or any Jag used or without a FULL warranty! Within my first year of ownership it‚Äôs been into service several times. A part on my sunroof broke upon my first use of it. Within its first 1,000 miles they had to replace a part to fix the wind/bug deflector that pops up when you open the sunroof. Then the infotainment system went completely dead. For weeks I had issues with it and it seriously pissed me off because without the infotainment system working, you cannot listen to music, use your handsfree device, adjust climate settings, use heated seats, or use the backup camera... it was awful. It was so bad that even when it was ‚Äúdead‚Äù, it drained my battery even when the car was locked and not in use. One morning my car almost did not start because it had drained the battery so far. .... Obviously I had my jaguar in the service department at least 2 times until they decided to just give me a loaner car until they could officially fix the issue. They told me that Jaguar was aware of the issue with the infotainment system but had not released a software update yet to fix it, and were being told it would be at least 1 month before a software update would be available. That floored me and I called corporate offices and sent an email to them expressing my extreme unhappiness with the situation. I was paying for a brand new expensive luxury vehicle under full warranty and I couldn‚Äôt use half of the options of the car! The best the dealership was offering for me was a loaner until the update became available. I was given a Jaguar case manager and they contacted the dealership service department and issued them an order to replace my entire infotainment system with a new one. I was skeptical because it‚Äôs the same system... My car was in the shop for a full week as they had to completely take the whole system out and replace it. So again, I would never buy a Jaguar used or without FULL warranty, as this would have cost me thousands of dollars. This all happened with less than 10,000 miles on the car. Luckily, after fixed and done with, I have had no issues at all. The car is still a dream to drive and I love driving it around town, and on twisty roads at high speeds. It is also fairly comfortable for long distance driving. Nice surprise, now I have 18,000 miles on the car and I have gotten 38mpg on the highway at reasonable speeds. It can QUICKLY go lower when driven hard but it is capable of 35+ mpg when driven right. This thing practically idles at 70 mph with the 8speed transmission and the engine power driving it. I wish they would stop putting continental tires on these cars, I really can‚Äôt stand them but so far they are doing OK. Obviously the back seat is far too small but coming from a 2 door Mercedes I didn‚Äôt think too much of it. The car is very difficult to get in and out of. I am tall and my seat position makes it difficult to get out of. Sound system is just OK.... definitely a big downgrade from my Harman Kardon Logic 7 which was disappointing to find out...also no SiriusXM.... but roll down the windows and just enjoy the 35t exhaust is the best! Sounds great! I think Jaguar is doing great things with their new designs, their warranty and lease programs, and the driving experience of their new vehicles. I drove an F-Pace 35t while my XE was in shop and I loved that car so much, I am considering rolling into the F-Pace when my lease is up. Jaguar also makes you feel valued as a customer with their ‚Äúgifts‚Äù that they send to you in the mail. They sent me some valve stem caps in a nifty case that I got a kick out of receiving. They also send a subscription
 to their new magazine for owners. The Jaguar app for your phone is nice....only when it works. If you have issues with your phone or your data connection you can‚Äôt remote start your vehicle. Sometimes the app is glitchy for me. I would prefer a remote start button on my key fob- as phone is not always reliable and you have to wait for it to log in, send and download messages from the vehicle. I‚Äôve had to delete and reinstall the app a couple different times because I couldn‚Äôt get the remote start feature to work. Anyway, I‚Äôm still overall happy with the vehicle. There are times when I regret trading my Mercedes on it, but there is no comparison when driving the vehicle. The driving experience is wonderful. The technology and sound system are subpar. It needs more storage up front. Resale value is pitiful! It‚Äôs more of a sports car than it is a luxury vehicle but that is what makes it compelling. I will have a hard time looking at any vehicle with less horsepower after owning this car, it‚Äôs a hard one to give up. Great engine in the 35t.

jaguar,xe,2017,Bryce, 10/12/2017,"My first Jag, and not my last.",4,"I leased this car 3 months ago and so far I am totally in love with it. The styling, handling, overall feel of the entire car is fantastic. I drive between Washington DC, NYC, Philadelphia monthly and has not let me down once. The Diesel engine is totally awesome and I always get fabulous fuel economy. I never have a problem finding diesel fuel anywhere either which is one of the first questions people ask when I tell them that is indeed Diesel. The leather is beautiful and the overall sophistication and look of the cockpit is great too. Im a bit of a car freak and over the past 7 years have owned a Mercedes Benz SL500, Infinity G37x, Audi Q5, Audi A3, as well as a BMW 535I. I had a moment when I wanted to be practical and bought a Toyota but last only lasted 5 months. Anyways its really a terrific car. Now not all cars are perfect... lets talk about some of the things that I don't like about the car and drive me crazy. The sound system is good quality, not the best but its just good at reasonable volumes. When you turn it up some of the speakers don't sound too hot. The plastic bottom door area rattles sometimes depending on the type of music you are playing and drives me nuts. Another thing that happens while listening to music loudly is that the piano black veneer trim I think rattles slightly too off and on depending on the song. I notice this more when the bass is tuned up anymore than half way balanced. The backseat legroom is terrible and always feeling like people are squeezing into the back seat. I am under 6 ft tall so someone sitting beside shouldn't ever be a problem unless they are taller than I am. Also getting in and out of the car is a little difficult. I don't know if its because its very low, or the angle of the drivers seat or what but I feel like an old man getting out of it sometimes and I'm in my late 20's. But really at the end of the day it is a fantastic car. It turns heads and just has such great style thats not overdramatic and in your face like some of the other brands. My sister and her boyfriend both have BMW 3 series and after driving my new Jag they are trading both in and looking at this car and considering the new F PACE. This will not be my last Jag, if this one treats me well for my 3 year lease I will be looking at getting another XE, or perhaps trading up and getting the XJ. I feel that all of the things I don't like about my XE will go away if I get myself into an XJ.

jaguar,xe,2017,Jose Pan, 02/20/2017,Better than the Germans!,5,"Test drove the A4, 3 series, and C class and was left unimpressed with what they had to offer. I then did some reading on the new xe. I decided to give it a try. Went in for a test dive and signed the paperwork that same day! I was I impressed by the styling, the handling and most of all the power it offered. The supercharged V6 has tons of it. When pressed, the engine seems like it can pull for days. The handling outclassed the 3 series. Now I must admit that the interior is not up to snuff compared to the compact  luxury sedan class. It leaves a bit to be desired. But then I turn on the car, put it into drive, hit the gas, and I am quickly reminded why I purchased this car. It does not disappoint. Plus did I say how much I like the reaction I get from others when I say I own a jaguar? Love the car. Test drive. I am sure you will too!

It is a very safe car loaded with most of the newest safety features. I had some problems with the entertainment system, that is my one and only complaint.

Save the higher-rated and, in many ways, more accommodating service of BMW, everything about the XE has given me a newfound appreciation for Jaguar.  The now iconic F-Type put Jaguar back on the map from years of dullness and now the XE (and especially its sportier variants) are breathing life back into the Jaguar brand.  From the sleek and elegant yet sporty design of the XE, there is very little that I don't love about it so far having put about 5k miles on my white knight 2017 35t.  The acceleration and performance is gripping and the handling is on par and, at least in some aspects, even better than German engineering.  Being on top of the game for some many years, it's impossible not to notice a scale back on quality of some German car brands albeit with simultaneous increases.  However, with this price point and a few tweaks on design and technology, I believe Jaguar can make the XE, the most formidable opponent of the 3 series/4 series and A4/S4 and C-Class models that's been seen in many years.   Please keep it up, folks at Jaguar!

jaguar,xe,2017,Lewis, 07/17/2018,"Good from far, but far from good",3,"The car looks great from first impression, but after owning the car for over a year I'm over it. The whole car just seems cheap to me. The paint work seems to scratch so easy compared to other cars I've owned (I keep really good care of my cars). When washing the roof of the car, the roof panel behind the sunroof gives way / dents in. I don't know if it's justified, but if panels of the car are so weak, it gives me an impression that the car is not safe. Plus I haven't been able to find any safety ratings on this car, which doesn't help. The backseat is not designed for kids at all. The seat belts lock up continuously for no reason, which is a big issue when your kid (who is a highback booster) can't get their belt buckled. The seatbelt won't unlock unless it's fully retracted, which can't happen unless you remove the belt from the belt guide in the booster. Also the boosters overhang the seatbelt receptacle. Long story short don't get the car if you have kids. The leather or pleather on the center console arm rest has big air bubble where the glue is no longer holding the (p)leather to the under-surface. A speaker has blown in the front passenger side. It's just seems so cheaply made for a not cheap car!

jaguar,xe,2017,Ron in Palm Springs, 02/05/2019,Looks were deceiving.....,2,"The car was purchased new and it was my 1st Jaguar. In the past I had BMW 5 of them and currently mercedes c300. The Xe just was a lackluster car. After a few months of ownership I found myself buying add on items to dress the interior some. Never in the past with any other cars did I fine myself buying after market parts to make it less plain. After a year I was looking at other cars and looked forward to ending the lease. Some of the dislikes other than the plainness was no light in the glove box, no vanity mirrors, poor navigation and a blind spot between the door pillar. The seats were not comfortable enough for a long trip and not an easy car to get out of. I kept th car exactly 2 years and only had 7400 miles on it.....not a great car.

jaguar,xe,2017,CPC, 02/12/2017,Great to Drive...Awful Technology,3,"I leased the is because I wanted a fun, pure, driving experience. And I got it.,.great acceleration and handling on all roads, very responsive and the paddle shifting is close to a true standard tranny.  At 75 you can drop into 7th and blow by the car next to you.  I enjoy the driving experience. But....Jaguar should be embarrassed to put this techno package into this vehicle.Believe ALL the reviews you read elsewhere about how cumbersome and unreliable the techno package is. Half the time it doesn't recognize my phone so  have to reboot blue tooth while I'm driving? Voice Commands?  HA,HA, HA.   This vehicle is AWD...and HORRIBLE in the snow. I skidded right through the 4 way stop  at the entrance of my neighborhood. I am truly SCARED when driving in the snow. Finally...from day one, I've experienced a noticeable clunking in the suspension when i turn sharply, at low speeds when the car is cold (ex> backing out of my driveway). Dealer claims not aware of any problems...even though my sales person told another  client had the same complaint. Maybe this is why it handles so poorly in the snow?  No exaggeration...I cuurse about something EVERY TIME I drive the car.

jaguar,xe,2017,M Hastings, 04/09/2017,Amazingly fun drivers car.,5,"The back seat is small in this car if you need a large back seat stay away. Other than that this is a drivers car. The 340HP Supercharged 6 is absolutely amazing, no engine lag and none should be expected. The handling and ride are amazing as well as the E-Steering. I haven't had this much fun since the 60's when I owned a 65 Shelby Mustang. Lastly, get the HUD because it shows you the speed (as well as other things) and often times you don't realize how fast you are going. One other thing, the price is slightly higher than it's competitors, but it's so worth it, and it's a Jag! Lastly I got 32 MPG on a 150 mile road trip today without babying it when needed."
jaguar,xe,2017,BOB A, 10/13/2017,From BMW to JAG,5,"This is my first Jaguar after eight leases of BMW's.  I was ready to re-order another 435i when I test drove the Jaguar and watched the u-tube comparision of the two.  I've had the car for 11 months now now and could not be more pleased.  Drives fantastic--best handling car I have ever had--accelerates like a rocket---overall great car that I would highly recommend.

jaguar,xe,2017,Charles O'Donnell, 05/08/2019,35T prestige is a much better choice!,5,"I agree that many Jaguar sedan models have a somewhat cheap looking interior compared to the competition, but check out the 35T Prestige model. This model has a very luxurious leather interior that compares to the very best competitors. The AWD and 6 cylinder engine are expensive options but they turn the car into the luxury car you imagined. Very fast, very economical, and the best warranty of any luxury car, bar none. The back seat is indeed a little tight, but if you primarily carry two people or maybe two plus kids, it is perfectly fine and definitely comfortable. They could solve this by making the front dashboard on the passenger side about 2 inches shallower. We have owned a Mercedes and a Volvo, this model is better than either of them. Don't waste your money on any of those overpriced 4 cyl models that every manufacturer is pushing. When you step on the gas in a Jag, you know you made the right choice. Lovin' our 35T. It is now four years old and I still stand by my original comments. A great car and a great warranty. Excellent service.

This vehicle is magical in looks, a great head turner, however a few weeks after purchasing I find myself looking and researching another vehicle, this car has terrible space in the front I‚Äôm about 5‚Äô7‚Äù and I can hardly fit the window at any drive up I often have to open the door, home link has not worked yet after several attempts with the person on the phone the sunroof and sunshade buttons have to be held to open and close it has been fixed once the drive stop while in traffic gas saver has stopped working again I have skinned my shin getting in the car a few times headed to dealership for repairs tomorrow the vehicle is not Jaguar quality I had to make a quick purchase should not have bought this car the speaker system is a joke really Jaguar shame on you, radio presets a joke they go to a different preset station when you start the car, steering wheel is manually operated. The dealership polished over many scratches and they where noticeable after first car wash now I‚Äôm stuck with a scratchy NEW car.

The trunk in extremely small and so were the minds who designed this for Jaguar, resale is horrible if you buy one talk them down it‚Äôs not luxury at all just looks good great mileage. So what do you think I should purchase next, Benz E Class or Audi A6,   3/15/18 ???üò©

When I looked in the manual it show at least four possible options of what could be wrong.  Then I went on line and couldn't find to answer to my questions, so I called the dealership and was told the it will be next week or week after  that before they could schedule appointment to get it in. I was told that all of your cars goes through inspection before shipped out.  I thought that I was getting a copy of the inspection but NO.  So I am returning the car because I don't know what is wrong with the car even though I really like the car.

jaguar,xe,2017,Christina Fridman, 02/27/2019,Stay Away! Technical Problems NOT COVERED!,2,"This car has been broken into more times then I have fingers. One time a device was placed into my CD system. I showed the dealership a video of how it seems thieves have a duplicate key. They walk up to this car and it opens like they have they key. Later, I saw on the news any vehicle is suspectible. Because of something new called radio frequency. However, they loved to use it on this particular car in the Hamptons, NY. The CD jam wasn‚Äôt covered under warranty. I had to use my insurance deductible and the new keys to program were almost one thousand dollars each time they broke in. I could no longer keep valuables or license, registration, or insurance in the car. The police said these were taken for ID fraud. I was advised to open a P. O. Box an extra $100 every 6 months by police and my insurance company because supposedly this is how thieves obtain fake insurance cards. This car cost me $10,000 down, $400 a month and untold repair cost plus my identity was stolen. I do NOT recommend this car to anyone!

I did my research for months before finally deciding to settle down and grab the RWD, I like the AWD but I felt the driving experience was more restricted. For more fun and excitement RWD is the way to go. The only complaints that I can say that I have which is actually my fault is the gas pump every few days lol. This car is truly a pleasure and fun to drive and often times I find myself making up store trips just to drive the car. For good looks value and out of this world acceleration you cant go wrong. Side note I do think that the S mode is for sick because this car turns into a completely different car I call it my mini Hellcat.

jaguar,xe,2018,Scott in PA, 11/15/2017,Spectacular Chassis In Search Of Interior Designer,4,"This car, even in base model form, drives exceptionally well. Too bad it is also reminiscent of my wife's old Lexus RX350...great chassis with an interior that made you want to get out of it as quickly as possible. The Good: Acceptable acceleration, excellent steering and braking. A little too much nose dive under severe braking, but everything else works so well it can be forgiven.  This car really holds a line when attacking those beckoning freeway on-ramps. Transmission shifts are buttery smooth and almost imperceptable.   The Bad: Ergonomics & Design. At 6' even, the armrest on the driver door is at least half a foot short of where I need it to be. Totally useless. The shelf on the door with the window, lock and mirror controls is at an odd angle. It causes you to fumble around the buttons, then twist your wrist weirdly to actuate the controls. Very disappointing. The seat was not particularly supportive, nor did I find the seat back comfortable. The seat back angle is such that my shoulders didn't touch at all, just the back of my head and my middle-back on down. Switchgear was also disappointing.... very flimsy. Response time on the touchscreen is outstanding...no delay. Good luck though performing simple tasks like phone pairing or seat heating.... or re-setting your trip odometer. Lastly, road noise intrusion is just too much. Freeway driving at 70mph should not be this loud.

Everything about the cars driving dynamics such as the acceleration, handling and exhaust note is way above the competition.

All of the mechanical portions of the car have been extremely reliable however the electronics have not. However the dealers do take care of any issues for free.

I had purchased the XJ8L for my wife ( her dream car), and found that it was just too big for her. The quality of the car was outstanding, so I decided on the 2009 XF. The car is a real stunner. Handles like a premium sports car should. The fit and finish of the car is second to none. The interior is drop dead gorgeous. Unfortunately, this is where the fairy-tale ends. We have found this car to be completely unreliable. The XF has a programing issue that allows the car's systems to remain active, therefore draining the battery.

jaguar,xf,2009,Brian, 02/29/2016,Love the Engine and Look - But Hate the Car,2,"I bought my 2009 Jaguar XF used, 5 years old.  Was very very happy for the first year.  Drives incredible, acceleration is to die for, by far and away the most fun car I have ever driven with its handeling and acceleration and gear shifter into ""S"" .      HOWEVER,  extremely disappointed in the electrical.  At $4k in repairs in the last 3 months.  The final straw was $1200 for my headlight to work again.  Oh, the standard joke, what did you get fixed?  A headlight?  - Why yes, and while the answer is more conveluted then just replacing a simple headlight, the question is correct.  The only thing wrong is the headlight, and something to do with the inside is the problem, with $700 for the new part, plus labor...  the car lights up like a Christmas tree.  I have Yellow lights, Red lights, White lights all going off at different times.     Overall, just really disappointed right now, and buying a second cheap car to get around with while I own this car too... 

If they had kept the technology simple, this would have been a much better car.   Really don't need the false alarms for tires low.  don't need the false alarms for coolant low.  If they had just kept the electronics simple, this would be a much better car.  The engine and seating and turbo is to die for.   Unfortunately, the electrical gives you a reason.

Be careful going down this road. Jaguar USA didn't care!"
jaguar,xf,2009,So Dissappointed, 05/19/2010,We are all Heartbroken,3,"I feel the pain of the other owners.  My car has been the worst investment ever.  Yes the car looks good but it is far from reliable and I would not recommend it anyone. My problems for the last 2 years include: total shutdown with no power to the car (towed to dealership), 2 months later, total shutdown again no power to the car, transmission stuck in drive (towed), computer system failure (in the shop for 33 days), 3 sets of brakes,  internal lights flashing on an off, constant no start issues.  The problems start at 3000 miles and have never stopped.  This car has major electrical problems and Jaguar and Momentum (dealership) knows it and will not admit to the problems. You are not safe!"
jaguar,xf,2009,Attorney88 , 03/18/2008,A new breed of cat,4,"I previously had a S-Type R. whose style is much maligned for its retro- trend, even though I think it is very cool in design. Nevertheless, the XF is really a drastic departure from the traditional Jaguar aesthetics. It is modern, high tech and a lot of fun to drive. The super charged engine gives inexhaustible supply of power. Especially when it is in manual shift mode, the gear changes are smooth and the car is eager to leap to action, like a pony alive. The styling, without doubt, is sleek. There is much debate about its front, some people denigrate it as Hyundai variant. But you have to look at the car in its entirety, then everything comes in harmony. "
jaguar,xf,2009,sgt_pepper, 06/09/2012,"""Year Of The Cat"" an update.",5,"I reviewed this car when I first got it in April 2008, and again several months later. Fast forward 4 years and 46,000 miles. I have had several problems. All but one (transmission shifter recall) were minor nuisances that didn't stop the vehicle and were handled quickly by the Jaguar dealer.

At the end of my lease (April 2012), I purchased the car and a dealer warrenty. I plan to keep driving and enjoying this cat for years to come. It is a stunning ride and has saved my life from some nimrod exiting the freeway from the middle lane. Great brakes and panic stop control!"
jaguar,xf,2009,TeeBee, 07/21/2010,Starting to have problems,4,"The second time in as many weeks that the tow truck have had to tow for the gear shifter. The Jaguar dealership in Austin Tx is just as bad with repairs. I will not own another Jag, I hate the way they have treated my wife through this process. It took 2 weeks to get the part, the car had to be towed to the dealership and they gave us a hard time with loaner and rental vehicles."
jaguar,xf,2009,Axemeister, 10/23/2008,XF Supercharged: A Wonderful Machine!,4,"This Supercharged XF is the blend between luxury and sport!  It has the virtues of a fine luxury sports sedan, but with the DSC off and Sport mode engaged this is a machine with huge power on tap.  The handling is quick and incredible, while always maintaining a slick and smooth feel,  I love the way it looks too."
jaguar,xf,2009,mrsaddle, 05/18/2010,Dream car,4,"I drove this and the supercharger version back in 2009 and immediately loved it. I initially was dead set on a supercharged version, but later settled on a premium luxury dealer demo car with just 9000 miles. I have put on 2000 miles so far and the car is wonderful in every way! The 300 hp is more then sufficient and everyone who rides in it thinks it is very quick! This car is also quite an attention getter as well. I own also a 82 Delorean and the XF generates just as much attention and that says a lot! I even have guy in 100 thousand dollar  911's turning there heads!"
jaguar,xf,2009,vrdjs, 05/23/2010,Transmission problems!,3,"To all my fellow XF owners who have found their car stuck in park, or drive,  I feel your pain.  I LOVE this car.  LOVE IT!  But, twice in the past 6 weeks, I have been stranded with my  vehicle jammed in Drive, unable to move the shift lever.  The dealership has been really nice about the situation, claiming it is a factory recall issue.  The fact that it has now happened twice makes me think that it is actually a design flaw.  I'm afraid I'm going to have to sell the car and would tell anyone considering purchasing one, to CAREFULLY reconsider.  Although it's really a great ride, the fact that it's left me on the side of the road twice now, is NOT OKI  for a $65,000 automobile. "
jaguar,xf,2009,hattmann, 12/08/2009,Great Car,4,"This is my 4th Jaguar.  This car is truly an E ticket ride.  Snappy acceleration and great handling.  Paddle shifters are a kick.  And the sound as you go through 4000 RPM's.  Wow, Can't even fathom what the SC version is like."
jaguar,xf,2009,nsribner, 07/25/2008,Muscle car for older man,4,"This is the best handling best driving full size car since my 1970 MB 300sel 6.3 sedan. Anyone who knows that car knows what I am talking about. So take your super cadis, hemi 300's and keep them, the new cool is a cat and thankfully not a ford cat."
jaguar,xf,2009,gobruin1010, 06/25/2008,I can't believe I bought a Jaguar,4,"I never thought I'll own a Jaguar but during a recent search of my next $50k car, I stumble on to a magazine article comparing Jag XF with Mbz 500E, GS460, Bmw 550i and saw that XF came on top.  I went to local dealer to test drive the car, and I was in love with design and how it rides. I'm coming off the lease from 04 Infiniti G35 coupe and was looking for car that was little more size. I went with basic model with a navigation to cut the cost down a little but this car already came with a lot of options I needed anyway.  Exterior design is slick and modern and interior is impeccable. But best quality about XF is the ride. Try it and you'll know what I mean. It's the best car I ever bought."
jaguar,xf,2009,John, 11/04/2008,Excellent Vehicle,4,"I test drove most competitors in this class, and was not happy until I test drove the XF.  I immediately knew this was a car for me!  I have owned Lexus and Acura, but they do not compare with this car. The interior design is spectacular with the leather dash, great seating, and technology, and the exterior sets it apart from its competitors in its class.  I have fallen madly in love with my first Jaguar - it is an exceptional vehicle!  The build quality is excellent and the transmission shifts through the gears beautifully!   I cannot explain how happy I am to have, on a whim, stopped in to test drive the XF. "
jaguar,xf,2009,Rob, 10/06/2010,Jove my XF,4,I drove Q45's for 10 years. I tried this car on a whim and fell in love with it! Great looking. Excellent ride. No mechanical problems. A little worried about snow condition driving. Highly recommended. Great value for the money!
jaguar,xf,2009,dongee, 06/14/2008,XF Supercharged,4,"Traded in an 04 XJ8, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Before buying the XF, I drove the following: Acura RL, Lexus GS 460, Infiniti M45, BMW 550, and Merc E550. In performance, styling and handling, the XF is as good or better than any of the others. It really shines in the interior; simple, understated, and luxurious. Have had only a couple of minor problems, including a bad battery. The dealership has been very helpful ¬ñ even made a lease payment for me for the inconvenience. So far, the finest car I have ever owned, and incredible value for the money."
jaguar,xf,2009,Laureate2, 06/15/2008,Great Car,4,"It sounds funny to say that a 60-plus car is a steal, but it's true.  The XF delivers so many standard features on the Supercharged that the Germans should hang their heads in shame for delivering their comparable equipped, high-priced, yawn-inspiring designed cars.  "
jaguar,xf,2009,Sherry R, 06/17/2008,Me & My Jag,4,"I have wanted a Jaguar since I was a teen. I am now in my 30s and it was worth the wait. I love my car, it handles like an eagle soaring in the sky. I command the road now and haven't been late for an appointment since I got the car because I can't wait to wake up and go. The only small complaint I have is I was surprised at some of the things that were not standard and we were upcharged for such as the heated front seats. I also think that the 19"" wheels should be standard on the Premium. My 03 Acura that I traded in had heated seats and the same wheels as my new Jag, other than that I am very happy. If you are on the fence jump off and DO IT. The car is terrific!"
jaguar,xf,2009,Ron G, 06/28/2008,Sunday Driver - Weekends only,4,"Although I drive our XF mostly on weekends the experience reminds me of being on vacation, nice environment and everything new and pleasant. The vehicle draws attention from absolutely everyone helping me to realize that hard work and doing it right pays off. The jaguar XF is a sports car in hiding until you punch it, then you accelerate from the norm while the tone of the exhaust leaves you with a smurt on your face.  So far I've only seen one other on the road & that's ok with me, I like being unique. I'm sure the XF will do well on the market but for now I like being one of the first to own it. The car is a must have, but if you don't buy it, I will not mind."
jaguar,xf,2009,Monica, 07/17/2008,Fun to drive,4,The car is reminiscent of my Aston Martin - which is why I bought it.  A 4 door version of an Aston Martin is what I truly desired.  It is fun and sporty for a luxury vehicle plus room for more than 2 with comfort and convenience for all.  Not your average Jag.  This car has lots of gumption.
jaguar,xf,2009,Ralph in FTL, 07/27/2008,One Sweet Kitty,5,"My dad always drove XJs when I was growing up, and they always turned heads.  Today's XJ needs a little boost of excitement.  But not this XF.  The interior is flawless.  The engine, especially in Sport mode, is flawless.  The 4 door coupe exterior is sexy.  I have heard (unfavorable) comparisons to a Lexus GS.  I don't see it. The XF blows the GS away in terms of style.  The GS looks like a blob comparatively.  Anyway, the bells and whistles are great - we got the vision package and the warm climate package, and it is just a joy to drive. We are also averaging 21 mpg."
jaguar,xf,2009,suniaz98, 08/12/2008,This makes two,3,This is our second XF in 6 months.  First one had too many problems that we negotiated a buyout. Now we have the second and Jaguar quality control is still poor. Love the styling and performance and that is about it. I don't think we will keep this one.  Very disappointed in Jaguar.
jaguar,xf,2009,Joe, 08/19/2008,My super white XF supercharged,4,"Just picked up my new white XF supercharged and week ago and boy what a week it has been. The car has performed beyond my expectations in every way. I get a kick out of people trying to see what kind of car it is as they say ""OH that's a JAG""! I looked at the BMW 550, Lexus 460, and the Mercedes E class but once I saw the XF I was sold. The best part you don't see many or any on the road like you do the others. Go buy one if you have the chance, you will not be disappointed."
jaguar,xf,2009,SL, 09/08/2008,Dream Car,4,"My new Jaguar XF SCV8 has simply exceeded my expectations, which were high to begin with.  After thoroughly researching and vetting all the cars in the category, and testing each one, the decision to go with the Jaguar became very simple.  Of the BMW, Mercedes, and Audi offsets, none offered the total package of the XF, and they are all fine vehicles.  The styling, road grace, sound system and incredibly smooth power made this THE car.  The Jag XF has received it's share of global acclaim, and my personal experience to date with the XF has validated the high praise. The folks at Jaguar got it right, top to bottom and I encourage anyone looking for a car in this range to drive one. "
jaguar,xf,2009,Leslie, 09/10/2008,Ultimate Black/Spice interior,3,"Had this car on order for 3 months. Picked up Sept 3 and has been to mechanic 3 times for engine light on. They can't seem to determine what problem is at this point, looking for Jaguar to replace car. I have owned BMW, Lexus, Porsche and Mercedes and was looking to buy another BMW when I found this car. If it wasn't for mechanical issues I am having with this particular car, I would have nothing but good things to say. Roomy, powerful, good trunk room, love exterior and interior. Excellent sound system,fit and finish could be better- However at this point, I think I bought a lemon so will see what future holds."
jaguar,xf,2009,BLKCAT, 09/17/2008,The Sexy Black Cat,4,"WOW... what a car. This car is an amazing work of art. I just purchased a black on black XF with the advance vision and navigation package. I love the engine and exhaust noise. I love the looks I get while driving it. I love the fact that I am only a part of a few people that have this car. Especially in LA, where most people drive MBenz, BMW, and Lexus I am proud to be driving the new hot Jag."
jaguar,xf,2009,Sgt, Pepper,"2009 Year Of The Cat, an Update",5,"I have had my XF for 5 months now and reviewed it on 5-18-08. The love affair just keeps getting better and better. I have averaged my gas mileage over time, and it's a lot better than I thought it would be. The XF is turning even more heads and getting more wows then before. As time goes by I have settled into this car very nicely and am very comfortable in an edgy sort of way. Cat's are just like that, a little edgy and mysterious, my Jaguar XF is no different."
jaguar,xf,2009,Javier C. Goizueta, 09/25/2008,The most awesome car I have ever owned,4,"My XF 2009 is simply awesome. The exterior style turns heads everywhere I go. MB, Lexus and BMW are a dime a dozen but not this Jag. It is unique. The interior is extremely comfortable and high tech."
jaguar,xf,2009,bill, 09/25/2008,Watch Out,4,"looks techy, sleek & athletic but very slow tranny reaction time, punch it you will see. Dog for a V8 - no sport mode - poor navi - only 2D - very very slow - Expensive over-rated sound system. Poor bass & tones - controls on wheel - needs to be buttons - poor resale"
jaguar,xf,2009,realdriver, 10/02/2008,Great Car. Well Executed and Beautiful,4,"This car is well executed and has good performance. Handling is great, but still very smooth and silky.  The car is comfortable and I find the interior very cool looking and functional. It is not your father's Jaguar, and anybody that says so is ignorant.  The XF tranny with paddle shifters is very quick to respond.  The base car at 300 HP is reasonably quick and for 50k it beats pants off of base BMW, MB and other 50k cars which come with 6 cylinder engines. "
jaguar,xf,2009,Jim, 10/14/2008,Legendary Performance Tour,5,"On Sunday 10/12 I attended the Jaguar Legendary Performance Tour event at the Monticello Motor Club, NY. Each guest was provided a new Jaguar (XK or XF) to take on a 25 minute country drive. I am looking at the XF so this was a  perfect opportunity. The car truly exceeded my expectations. But it gets better, upon return each guest was escorted to the race track. We were assigned a car and professional race driver. We were each given the opportunity to test drive the cars on a real track. For the second lap the professional takes the wheel. Words cannot describe the experience of a race car driver putting the XF through its paces. I walked away from there with a new found respect for the XF."
jaguar,xf,2009,jkviper, 10/18/2008,Nice Kitty!!,4,"This is my first Jaguar. I am a new owner and so far this car has exceeded my expectations.  Great balance of sleek design, power, and comfort. Fit and finish is great and a heck of a lot of fun to drive"
jaguar,xf,2009,clive, 10/26/2008,Jag lover with few exeptions,5,"I love the solid feel of the car. The balance is wonderful. I had one mech problem, promptly fixed."
jaguar,xf,2009,Wen, 10/28/2008,A fun car to own,4,"I fell in love with the car after seeing it the first time. The car looks great. It has all the toys and features I could ever wanted in a car. Warm and cold package is a big plus. Blind spot warning is a nice feature. The auto dim mirror and navigation are nicely done. The rotating shifter dial is a nice change. The paddle gear shifters are convenient. The sound system is good.  The handling is good, but not great compared to my BMW (performance 8). The noise reduction is not so good compared to Lexus and MB (comfort 8). The fuel economy is good for a V8.  It may lack things in some areas, but overall it is so much fun to drive, I can ignore the rest."
jaguar,xf,2009,bulldog, 11/19/2008,THEY FOUND THE DAMN NOISE,4,"I just wanted to let those who have been frustrated like I have been about a silly creak or chirp in what seems to be the carriage of the car that the fix ultimately is an easy one - thank goodness.  There are two issues with the car and maybe it's the early ones, but one is the sunroof clips - fixed.  The other is this creak or chirp which really ticked me off.  I was at the brink on this one but my service rep figured it out today.   The problem happened to be the cables attached to the latch which releases the back seats so they can fold down. YES, they fold down.  The cables were rubbing against the metal at the top of the trunk. Problem solved.  The car is great as it should be."
jaguar,xf,2009,KCMEDC, 11/30/2008,Engineering Mistake?,4,"Fast.  Transmission is great. Handles well especially when using manual mode while driving.  Does everything advertised. I buy a car every six months and so far, this may go down as one of the best."
jaguar,xf,2009,jag lover, 12/16/2008,Love the XF,4,"This is my fourth Jag and certainly the best. I had S Type Rs, Xtypes and fell in love with the new XF Supercharged in Silver- it is light years better than the old S type- better engine, trans, handling and of course the design. Back seat passengers don't complain now and the boot is rather large. I have driven in snow /ice with snow tires and the winter mode keeps you moving without fail. Valets love it and makes me grin every time I drive it too 7000 miles so far and only problems have been alignment and windnoise which the dealer fixed . If you are considering BMW, Audi, Lexus or Mercedes, take a hard look at the XF- even get 22-24 mpg on the highway!"
jaguar,xf,2009,Jag Owner, 01/02/2009,3 kids seat fit in the back,4,"This is the only sedan I found that will hold 3 kids seats in a row in the back. Most have very deep buckets for two that makes having 3 kids seats impossible. I went to buy an Acura MDX - it drove like a van. The Jag dealer was next door. After juggling one big baby seat and 2 boosters I got them to fit - then I test drove it, WOW!  I had a BMW 330i and have had a Boxster, this XF beats them both. It is very comfortable, will hit 60 in 6 secs and has one of best sounding rumblings when you get on it. The base model with heat package is everything you would want. This car will turn heads!"
jaguar,xf,2009,Gratien Nadeau, 01/04/2009,Love it!,4,"Perfect reliability except one little glitch: gas tank door that refused to open. Fixed (I hope). Only major downside: gas consumption which averages between 16 mpg (US) city and 19.3 hwy (14,7-12,2L/100kms). This is the most enjoyable car I've owned (including Mercedes SL450, BMW 735i, Lexus etc.). I've rediscovered the fun of driving and even if long past, I feel like a kid again looking forward to an excuse to go for a drive, like I felt with my muscle cars in the 60s. "
jaguar,xf,2009,Spidey, 01/07/2009,Great car,4,"This is a great car all around; gorgeous inside and out, solid power and handling.  Very comfortable ride, much more so than my Lexus. Would go for premium luxury next time; I miss the backup camera and Xenon headlamps and cooled seats."
jaguar,xf,2009,ROBERTO RODRIGUEZ, 01/23/2009,Simply a beautiful automobile,4,This is Jaguar's best automobile in quite a while. It remains a distinguished and stylish car. I truly believe that this model will remain high in its class for years to come. 
jaguar,xf,2009,joet, 01/25/2009,"Great car, but...",4,"Just took my XF on a round trip to Vegas from San Diego.  It was a great ride all the way through.  Even without the super charged engine, she managed just fine.  My only gripe about this car is the sunroof continues to squeak even though the dealer has worked on it.  There was a chirping sound at low speeds and the dealer found that to be a cable rubbing against the chassis that connected to the rear seat release to the trunk.  Everything else on the car is A-1. Quite and upgrade from the S-type.  Now, if I can only get those Celena wheels without foreclosing on my house."
jaguar,xf,2009,Wolfgang, 01/28/2009,"Impulse Purchase, but so far no regrets",4,"I had to have it, always wanted a Jag, but have always been to practical until now.  With big losses in the stock market decided to spend my money rather than watch it diminish through no fault of my own.  Love it.  Love the looks, the interior, performance and the entire start-up display.  Love the sound of the engine, fast runs through sweeping corners and listening to good music in the elegant interior.  Looked at Merc, BMW, Audi, Lexus, Acura and Infiniti.  Only the Jag spoke to me.  Only the gas milage is troubling, but I'm coming out of a Hybrid, so of course, it hurts.  But such a sweet ride.  I only worry that such conspicuous consumption in a prolonged recession is in bad taste. "
jaguar,xf,2009,Titan, 02/10/2009,Most fun I've had driving,4,"I test drove just about every other car in this class and I just fell in love with the XF. I am admittedly an avid fan of most things British, but my fiancee wasn't and a few joy rides in this beauty and she was completely converted. In Dynamic Mode this thing is an outright monster. "
jaguar,xf,2009,eastonpacarguy, 02/16/2009,Great Car,4,"I never thought I would own a Jaguar until I saw the XF.  We have had the car for about two weeks.  Overall I love it.  Great looking and driving car.  My only concerns are pronounced tire noise, some squeaks from the sunroof, and one random incident of a rough idle at start.  "
jaguar,xf,2009,Rene, 03/28/2009,WOW,4,"A wonderful vehicle, glad I made the decision to buy. "
jaguar,xf,2009,Marcia, 04/07/2009,2009 XF,4,"This is my 3rd Jaguar. It's the talk of the town. It's in a class by itself, the shape, design, performance is just out of this world. Thumbs up!"
jaguar,xf,2009,Deshawn, 04/21/2009,The Ultimate Ride,4,"I have had my XF for almost a month now, and love it! I purchased the premium model with tech package, warm climate and advance vision pack. I also was given the 20inch wheels that comes with the super charge model (someone did not want them when they got their super charger..thanks!) from the dealer and the lighted kick plates. This car stops drivers in their track, I can't believe how many times people stop me in 7 series BMW and S class Mercedes to ask what I am driving. The car is beautiful inside and out. The ride, the speed and the handling  makes me wish I could drive on a racetrack.  If you purchase this car you will not be sorry!"
jaguar,xf,2009,ellsworth, 05/11/2009,Incredible Value For a Supercar,4,"I've had my Supercharged for about ten months.  I'm extremely happy.  The combination of refinement, handling and power is phenomenal for the money.  The styling grows on you and I'm constantly getting compliments and stares.  The cars are still rather rare where I live so I get lots of questions. I was concerned about winter driving but was pleasantly surprised.  I did put Dunlop performance winter tires on and drop to 18"" wheels during the winter.  There's no way the performance tires work in wintry weather.  Two quibbles: the touchless glove box is stupid and often balks and the fuel filler cap without a handle is likewise dumb and had to be replaced.  Other than that....I love this car!"
jaguar,xf,2009,The Hammer, 05/15/2009,The Best,5,Worth every quarter.  Heads turn wherever I go with it.  People actually pull in the drive and talk about it.  Workmanship is excellent.
jaguar,xf,2009,COLBOL15, 05/15/2009,Should have gotten it sooner!,4,"Outstanding road handling. 4.2L engine supercharged is an amazing option.  You will be acknowledged by others on the road. Lock your passenger doors, someone will jump-in and request a ride. Standard sound system is above average. If I had to negotiate the car again, I would request the upgrade version. The experience begins with: Press, rotate, step on the gas and enjoy!!!! (No keys, no shifter)"
jaguar,xf,2009,Wolfgang, 05/18/2009,"Over 5,000 miles and it's still great",4,"This is my second review, the car now has over 5,000 and remains flawless.  Just completed a 1,050 trip, averaged 27 mpg while cruising at 75-80 mph, car was loaded too.  Have had only one problem, rattling sunroof, dealer fixed it.  There is some wind noise from the side mirrors, even though they replaced the door seals, but no sign of wind leak.  They say mirrors make the noise and a fix is coming. :)  Love this car."
jaguar,xf,2009,w6375, 07/08/2009,Super Hot Car,4,"My 2009 Jaguar XF Supercharged Sport Sedan is the coolest car I have ever owned.  This includes a long list of Mercedes and other high-end brands.  It is beautiful and incredibly fast.  I get compliments on the style, color (Botanical Green), and general good looks.  Many Mercedes and BMW owners have stopped to inquire about this Jag.  It is an amazing car and value for the price.  You will not regret buying this one."
jaguar,xf,2009,Bill, 07/22/2009,Can't trust it,3,"I have had more problems in 8 months with this car then I had in the last 6 years combined  with my BMW and Lincoln LS. Battery cable problems left me stranded and had to be repaired twice. Windshield washers repaired twice. Touch screen replaced. Check engine light fixed. My local dealer has been OUTSTANDING and saved my sanity. On style and ride the car wins hands down; but if I had it to do over again, I would be in a BMW. Beauty doesn't help when the car won't run."
jaguar,xf,2009,luvtns, 07/27/2009,Classy Vehicle,5,"This has to be the nicest vehicle I have ever purchased. It is classy, beautiful to look at, interior is scrumptious and comfortable.  I even get an average of 26 mpg combined city & highway."
jaguar,xf,2009,raviji, 08/02/2009,fun to drive,4,"we took the car on a 850mi round trip...performed very well. Average 26 miles despite getting stuck in montreal traffic. Much better than infiniti G35.  other than minor issues, car has performed very well. "
jaguar,xf,2009,SC, 08/04/2009,Unbelievably fun car,4,"Easily the coolest and most fun to drive car i have ever owned.  Previous cars were BMW and Audi. Get stares and comments regularly (not that i necessarily enjoy all the attention). Ride quality, handling, and what seems like limitless power are the highs.  Not to mention luxurious interior and all the gizmos (adaptive cruise, blind spot detection, parking aid, dynamic suspension, ventilated seats, ipod, sat radio, etc).  no problems or bugs so far (nearly 5000 miles). we'll see how long the 20inch tires and brakes last."
jaguar,xf,2009,robe, 08/12/2009,The best,4,"After having three 5 series BMW's in the past ten years I was ready for a change from the same old same old...i- drive and run flat tires ended the ten year the love hate relationship.  My first XF was the V6 ( I'm in Australia) and it was a real disappointment performance wise after the 530i I had previously. For all its sins the BMW had it over the Jag hands down. So after 3months, I took the financial pain and switched to the Premium Luxury 4.2, and what a difference.  I've had mine for just on a year and it continues to delight me and frankly a lot of others judging by comments and interest in the vehicle.  "
jaguar,xf,2009,G. H. B, 08/18/2009,2 Jags two times the problems,3,"We purchased two XF's, problems started about two months after. Engine lights coming on, two tires blown, brake noise, steering pulsating, brake fade, bad, roof seal, wind noise and more. Continental tires on delivered vehicles that are not recommended. Dealership is trying but no luck so far, we may be looking at Lemon Law. We love the look of the car. We were very excited to make the purchase as this is a very sexy car and should be much better than what we have experienced. These are our first Jags and possibly our last. Problems are consistent on both cars. Jag has a problem and they need to fix it! "
jaguar,xf,2009,Gary, 09/02/2009,It's a looker,4,"Bought my Supercharged XF from a local dealer in Southern Calif.  Was originally looking at the XJ, but way too low tech.  This dealer modifies a lot of vehicles.  Mine has ground effects and 22 inch tires.  I get comments everywhere I drive.  Just passed 8000 miles.  Made four trips with it to Las Vegas, have installed escort ci 9500 for a little extra safety on long drives.  Only problem is the electronic parking brake knob gets very hot during long drives."
jaguar,xf,2009,Jadant, 09/17/2009,2009 Jaguar XF Supercharged,4,"I assumed the lease on this beautiful Liquid Silver Jaguar XF Supercharged almost 1 month ago.  I picked it up in the Bay area and drove it up along Interstate 5 all night long and it was the most exhilarating drive.  Going through the mountains near Shasta was smooth and I felt very confident going over and around the bends.  I put approximately 750 miles that night and even though I was tired when I got home I couldn't help but stare at the beautiful curves and elegant design, and couldn't leave it dirty, so I ended up washing it. "
jaguar,xf,2009,Vikram, 09/26/2009,"Better than ""Ultimate Driving Machine""",5,"Got my XF 5 months ago and I still feel the same excitement to drive this car as I felt on the first day! I've owned BMWs (both, 3- & 5-series sedans) for over 8 years and never thought I'd walk away from a BMW, but when I test drove an XF I was hooked in 45 seconds! BMWs are awesome, but the Jag has far superior handling, and the transmission & ride are unbelievably smooth. My wife never turns down my ""rare & limited"" offers to drive the XF, gladly handing me her Lexus RX350 keys.  Also, I absolutely enjoy the looks I get when I drive by anyone. :)"
jaguar,xf,2009,Drew in NOVA, 11/30/2009,Beauty and the Beast,4,"I've had the my Supercharged XF about 1 1/2 years.  Loved the design and content...but.  Engine warning lights, blown manifold gaskets, inoperable gas cover (try that when on empty), recalls, rear brakes gone at 15K with tires right behind and today dead in the garage and pulled out by a towing service (wonder what damage they did) after numerous engine and gearbox errors on dash.  Sexy design and still draws looks.  Seems the electronic gremlins and reliability are still subpar.  Should have stuck with my first instinct of a BMW.  At least the routine maintenance is included with them!"
jaguar,xf,2009,jadant, 12/03/2009,Thrilling Drive,4,"I had test driven the BMW 550, Lexus GS350, Acura RL/TL, and Infiniti G37.  None of these could compare to the driving experience of the Jaguar XF SC.  The handling isn't as tight as the BMW but it is comfortable on long hauls.  This automobile can also get up and go.  I only have 4700 miles so cannot comment on reliability at this point but from what I have experienced I do not have any complaints.  The only issue I have experienced is a CATS failure but this occurred only once and to reset all I had to do was stop the car and restart the engine."
jaguar,xf,2009,Mike V, 12/12/2009,XF Fun,5,"We purchased our XF about 60 days after the model intro. We have had zero issues with this car. My wife had a bit of difficulty with the paddle shifters at first but now enjoys them as do I. This car continues to amaze in handling, acceleration and, believe it or not, fuel economy. We average 21 mpg in overall driving with 70+% being in town destinations. Rear seat leg room? It is adequate. Trunk room is satisfactory. Put down the rear seat and viola, an instant Costco runner."
jaguar,xf,2009,dada0421, 01/06/2010,Don't be fooled by the looks. LEMON!!!,3,"Fell in love with the car the first time my husband and I saw it. A month after leasing it the problems started. I have had it towed twice because of no start, hot shotted once. It has also been in the shop for the drivers window twice being stuck, twice for a rattling in the roof. Jaguar usa has been of no help. I think i have a lemon and have contacted a lawyer."
jaguar,xf,2009,Donna H., 02/05/2010,Head Turning,4,"This is my third Jag {2 previous S- Types}, and it is awesome!  Total strangers ask me if they can check it out and want to know if I would recommend it.  Since I have had NO problems with the car, I say, OH YA, I love it!  My gas mileage is not very good since I drive faster than most but I do enjoy the upgraded Bowers And Wilkins stereo system and living in Houston, the rear window shade has really helped keep the car cooler.  The a/c seats rock when it's 100 degrees too!  I currently have 8,300 miles on the car and can't wait to go on a road trip with lots of curves!  "
jaguar,xf,2009,UW HUSKY FAN, 02/16/2010,BEWARE!!! The car gets stuck in gear!!!,3,"OK...I have been very impressed with my Jaguar until now.  It has 20,000 miles on it and it's starting to fall apart.  That's unacceptable for a car that's a year old.  I just brought it to Jaguar dealership and they notified me of a recall because the car gets stuck in gear.  I just brought it there 4 days ago and SUPPOSEDLY they fixed it.  Tonight when I got home it was stuck in gear.  Bad work by the dealership?  Possibly, but no car a year old should have major transmission problems like this.  It's a total inconvenience and I'm lucky I was at home and not somewhere else.  The car has been great but this is a MAJOR issue and has left a very bad taste in my mouth."
jaguar,xf,2009,CA dreamin, 03/21/2010,Transmission nightmare,2,"Read the other review about this Jaguar having transmission problems.  The exact same thing is happening with the 2009 Jaguar XF that I have.  It is getting stuck in park.  Had to have it towed to the Jaguar dealership because none is in the town I live in.  SUPPOSEDLY they fixed it.  One day later the exact same thing happened - stuck in park.  Now I can not drive the car and have to get it towed once again.  Less than 20,000 miles on this car and it is doing this.  This is a serious malfunction that Jaguar must not be able to fix!  DO NOT BUY THIS CAR."
jaguar,xf,2009,Davelv, 04/04/2010,Great car but lots of troubles,4,"The supercharged engine is fantastic. Push the pedal and go!  But, in the first year it has been in the shop so many times.  AC O ring failed in first month - 2 weeks in shop.  Screen locks up - have to disconnect battery repeatedly.  Battery power failure - loose connection finally found in console. Rubber hood support bumpers fall off in Las Vegas heat.  Front tires have inner wear that ends tire life early - why?  Maintenance costs $150 for oil change and $450 for 20k service. Rear brakes wear out in 13k miles - considered normal  but another $400.  If you get one of these, be prepared to spend a lot to keep it up.  It is a fantastic car, but not cheap.  "
jaguar,xf,2009,Heart broken, 04/18/2010,Heartbroken,4,"It actually pains me to write this review because I REALLY LOVE my car. I've had it for about 2 yrs and first problem was at 7K miles I needed new brakes. Also with the 19"" tires you really can't drive over potholes,  I also replaced 3 already.  The real heartbreak is that now at 22,000 miles my transmission/gear shift knob doesn't work!  Took it to service they ""fixed"" it and now one month later I'm home stranded AGAIN with the same problem.  According to svc ctr there is a recall but I can't find any news on it.  I still love this car but wish I had leased it because it will not last me the long yrs I hoped it would.  I don't know what to do, I still love my car. "
jaguar,xf,2009,Cat Lover, 05/25/2010,Problem free,5,"Rare enough to draw admirers, comfortable, fast. Great gas mileage for such a fast, heavy car. No problems to report.  "
jaguar,xf,2009,schaffin, 06/15/2010,What a shame,3,"This wonderful fun stylish car has left me stranded on the road with the transmission stuck in drive twice. The fortunate thing is you are usually in a parking lot when you discover your up the creek without a paddle.  The first time the dealer had it for 4 days.  One hour after leaving the dealer it was back on the tow truck. CA lemon law here we come. Fell in love with this car the first 30K, hard to stay married to a car that has dumped me twice.   "
jaguar,xf,2009,Jagfan, 03/21/2008,Finally,4,"Jag has finally entered the 21st century with the XF.  The car builds upon the excellent XK series and addresses all shortcomings.  I've owned all the luxury and sport nameplates and this is the finest combination of luxury, performance, and looks I have ever seen this side of the MB CLS."
jaguar,xf,2009,drmikecmd, 03/24/2008,Amazing Car,4,"This car is amazing.  I drove several cars prior to purchasing this one inlcuding Lexus GS, BMW 5 series, Audi A6 (no S though), and Mercedes E class.  The Jaguar has the best of all these cars melded into it.  The Lexus is too luxury and the BMW too sporty.  The jag is ""just right.""  The interior feels contemporary and refined yet sporty.  The ride is smooth but responsive and the engine/transmission seem to have no problems with any request I make no matter how insane it seems.  If it's too insane it will let me know and just ignore the request which is a very nice feature.  I could go on and on but I will end by saying that you just can't go wrong if you buy this car.  You wont regret it."
jaguar,xf,2009,Jerry, 03/25/2008,"Power, beauty and soul",5,"I've owned the car less than a month and have been thrilled with the car's overall performance, interior build quality, surround sound and easy to use touch screen nav, audio, and communication panel (I did need to read the manual). I have found the rear mirror / blind spot detection system to be very helpful.  The V8 purrs, but not like my father's Jag.  When using the paddle shift, there's no question this cat likes to run with more of a throaty growl, meanwhile holding a very tight corner.  The ride is stiffer than I would have expected, but it is welcomed.  True with Ian Cullum's other designs, this one gets tons of looks.  Be prepared to answer many questions about the car by admirers."
jaguar,xf,2009,jimhoj, 03/26/2008,A Pleasant Surprise,4,"This is truly a departure for Jaguar. The XF handles with the feel of a sports car but has interior room and comfort unlike anything in its class. Even with the naturally aspirated 4.2L V8, the car is more than a match for most American roads. Test drove it along with the GS 460, A6 and E550.  No comparison in handling.  This was quite a surprise considering the competitive pricing of the XF. Bought it on first visit to dealer.  Despite many previews referring to disappointing exterior styling, this car turns heads.  In the first week, had the alarm set off several times by overzealous observers in parking lots. Interior styling is simple and unique and has no equal in its class."
jaguar,xf,2009,Al, 04/09/2008,Very Happy,4,"I ordered the Jaguar XF a couple months before it came out based on the way the interior and exterior looked. I knew it would have to be comfortable, ride well, and be quick. I was really impressed once it came in and I actually purchased the vehicle. It really takes some time to figure out all the settings especially with the transmission, suspension, and engine response settings. It really is a beautiful car inside and out. I would highly recommend it. I previously owned a 2001 Mercedes CLK 430 and had concerns buying a Jaguar after a Mercedes. I was overly impressed with the Jaguar. "
jaguar,xf,2009,Nicole W., 04/10/2008,My new XF,4,"I am so excited to own this car.  My last car, a Lexus ES 330 is nothing compared to this.  I love everything about it. The car handles so well.  Went up to 110 (shhhhhh) and felt like I was going 50 mph.  The features are plentiful.  The advanced vision package is a must!  My favorite feature, driving down the street and people just stare.  Seriously, they actually stare!  When I valet park, they put my car right in front!  I love it.  Attention getter, excellent performance, more features than you could ever possibly use.  I've have the car two weeks and I still have not finished reading the manual."
jaguar,xf,2009,rockvillewolf, 04/13/2008,What a Ride!,5,I have had my XF for a week and everytime I get in it and crank it up it is amazing. The handling of this model is significantly better than the S-type. The interior is not like anything I have seen.  The seats are very comfortable. The pickup speed of the car is unbelievable. It will cruise at about 75 mph just under 2000 RPMs. Mine is a radiance color and it is stunning. The number of drivers turning their head to see this car is remarkable. I thought maybe not having the wood grain steering wheel would be a minus to being able to grip that wheel especially on the highway is quite the match.
jaguar,xf,2009,KENNY XF, 04/15/2008,Fast 4 door coupe,5,"Trade my CLS 550 for the supercharged XF. I had Acura RL, GL Class before, this car handles super, the adaptive suspension is tuned for both comfort and sporty. Steering has a great feel at high way speed, and it is light when parking. The sound system is wonderful, better than any car I had."
jaguar,xf,2009,Jay, 04/21/2008,2009 XF Supercharged,4,"I picked up this car about two weeks ago after giving up on my search for a new Audi S5. Wow, am I really happy I didn't go with the S5. This car, especially the supercharged, feels as if you are driving a $125k automobile. With 420 hp, it doesn't feel like a car, it feel like a rocketship. Reaching 120 mph is just way too easy. The interior is the most beautiful and most technologically advanced I have ever seen. It trumps anything Audi, BMW, Mercedes, or Lexus has ever done. The exterior has flawless lines and makes a 4 door sedan feel like a 2 door sports coupe. "
jaguar,xf,2009,TR, 04/22/2008,Very Satisfied,4,"My 99 Audi A4 - 5 speed with every option including special suspension and recaro seats still looked new, but I needed something a touch larger.  I had been actively looking and driving everything from the BMW 6 series through Lexus GS for over a year.  Nothing was getting me excited on looks or even came close to the fun of driving the Audi. FGOS - the new A5 was to small. Then I saw the XF, tested it and bought one on the spot.  It may not be as nimble as my previous car but it is certainly fun of a different kind to drive. I actually look forward to my 60 min commute to work each way.  So far no regrets."
jaguar,xf,2009,karenm, 04/24/2008,Wow... where can I go next,4,"This is the best car and yes a head turner.  I live in LA and I have only seen one other on the road.  I drove the BMW 550 and Mercedes but I didn't want to drive what everyone else had. I remember seeing the XF at the LA Auto show and loved the stying.  When I saw it and drove it, it had only been out 10 days. Amazing. Love the distinctive styling, rides like a dream. Love the touch screen and the nav is so intuitive.  The swivel air panels and blue lighting is the best of all auto technology. Love the sporty ride, paddle shifting and the great trunk with fold down seats."
jaguar,xf,2009,Don, 04/27/2008,The New Jag Rocks!,4,"Great car.  Great looks, Great build quality.  Very impressive and comfortable.  This is a winner, and it shows that Jaguar can build a great sedan at a reasonable price."
jaguar,xf,2009,Paul XF, 04/28/2008,Can't live with the vibration,4,"The supercharged XF sold itself when I saw if for the first time.   Unfortunately, it might sell itself again if Jaguar doesn¬ít address the steering vibration.  For a still undetermined reason my XF shakes.   It is most noticeable (and visible) in the steering wheel, but can also be felt in my seat as well.  My dealer has tried everything they know how to do and it still shakes.   Jaguar engineers say it¬ís a high performance car and vibration is to be expected.  I say if they¬íre betting Jaguar¬ís future on this car, they might want rethink their position.    Regrettably, despite its promising appearance it¬ís not a car I¬íd recommend until they get the first year bugs worked out. "
jaguar,xf,2009,Don, 05/05/2008,XF Exceptional!,5,"This is not a traditional Jaguar in design or execution. I had two prior Jaguars that I enjoyed, but this XF breaks out of the old Jag form, with grace and style! Great looking, nice build quality, great features.  The car looks like a four door coupe, and the interior is gorgeous with nice materials and features. The drive is crisp, and handling is good. There is just enough soundproofing to offer comfort, but not total isolation. The engine performs well, even without supercharger, and the exhaust tuning sounds great too. I was originally a skeptic of the  pop up shifter, but it is easy to use, and with the paddle shifters it is easy to executre crisp gear changes. "
jaguar,xf,2009,Ripside, 05/06/2008,Can't wait to drive to work each day,5,"This is the best car Jaguar has ever built. I've owned 2 XJs, and while the XJs had their high points, this car is fun, comfortable, economical (compared to the XJs), and a modern.  I constantly look for excuses to go for a drive.  I hit 28 MPG on the freeway and 18+ in city driving. Not bad for a V8.  I've had more people stop to ask what kind of car it was, out of the blue - in parking lots, drive-throughs, etc.  The 440W audio is the best you'll find in a car in this class.  The interior is nearly flawless (one more storage compartment would make it perfect).  Living in town, I've yet to push it anywhere near the limits - and the acceleration far exceeds my expectations."
jaguar,xf,2009,Jeff Bradley, 05/10/2008,Excellent Cat,5,"I have a 2001 XKR convertible and I needed a good sport sedan. I am thoroughly impressed with my new supercharged XF in every way. The performance is outstanding in every way: acceleration, braking, turns, and overall handling. One of my first drives was to drive up and down the very narrow and winding Spring Mountain Road in Napa. The vehicle performed like a sports car, hugging the turns and going 60 mph both up- and downhill with no effort. The paddle shifts are perfect. The vehicle is very comfortable and the passengers enjoy the handling, even when I drive it fast  (the only way to drive this vehicle). I get compliments of the auto's looks every day. This vehicle should save Jaguar."
jaguar,xf,2009,Watershield, 05/13/2008,My First Jag,4,"Well, the previous jags were a snorefest to me.  Than I saw it on the internet and bought it based solely on research and reviews without ever seeing one in person.  So I would say, yeah they got it right if a never-before-jag owner just had to have one.  It could have turned out after all that wait and anticipation that the reality may not live up to the expectation. However, despite my growing expectations, the car (inside and out plus its performance) blew me away.  It is as near perfect car as I have ever known."
jaguar,xf,2009,Norb, 05/13/2008,Tested all in its class,4,"Biggest problem is the people who stop you to ask what is this? Never had a car with more compliments, praises, and surprised that it isn't a 80K or more car. Have owned many cars, this is a good one; have had no problems, and being a gadget freak, I find the navigation a little clumsy to operate. Stereo is incredible. In short, if you want to really enjoy driving, give it a shot before buying anything else."
jaguar,xf,2009,Sgt. Pepper, 05/19/2008,2009 - The Year Of The Cat,4,"Last September I put a $1000 deposit on a picture in the Jag dealers showroom and I set my sights on the April delevery date. I am totally satisfied. This car is an adrenaline pumping, eye catching, heart pounding, head turning, curve hugging, road loving, lap of luxury feline. I can find no great fault or lack of thought in the XF. If there is a model that will end for all time the second rate standing of the latterday Jaguar, the XF will do it. I believe this model is an instant classic. Check it out and you tell me if I'm wrong.   "
jaguar,xf,2009,JSS, 05/22/2008,XF Supercharged,4,"Having owned an E-Type V12 many years ago I decided to try another Jaguar and I most certainly am not disappointed. The difference in build quality, performance  and reliability is stunning. Where my E-Type broke down every time I took it out, my XF has been flawless. I can't think of one thing to complain about other than the voice doesn't control the climate or audio - big deal. The performance is breathtaking and this is by far the best car I have ever owned. Thank God for the automatic speed limiter as I am sure I would have been arrested for speeding by now. The only problem is everyone keeps asking me about it, at stop lights, parking lots - everywhere. A small price to pay."
jaguar,xf,2009,Don H, 05/26/2008,Automotive nirvana,4,"I have owned a number of Jaguars, and this is the best one yet.  Exhilarating performance blended with quiet luxury, subtley agressive good looks, sophisticated design, amazing fit and finish.  This car looks lots better in person than in pictures, and just wait till you drive it.  People are giving me the thumbs up wherever I drive it.  My jags (all V8s) have been reliable as heck and fit/finish of this exceeds all prior models.  Gas mileage thus far is about 16 in town, about 23-24  highway but I haven't gotten wild yet.  The dynamic mode and paddle shifters are a blast!  Some Jag fuddy-duddies won't like the look, but I say tough tiddly- winks; this is the kind of departure Jag needed. "

jaguar,xf,2010,AndrewSC, 10/28/2010,Head Turner,5,"I took the car for a spur of the moment road trip 2 days after purchase.I love the way this car hugs the road and makes you feel really involved in sport and dynamic mode. I love the fact that you don't see many on the road. At first glance it looks like a Aston Martin from the rear. I did my homework and compared many other models from BMW, MB,Audi, and Infiniti. nothing compares to the driving experience and looks of this car. Jaguar has really outdone themselves on this one. Away with the old days of Jag and in with the new. I have been treated very well by the dealership and would recommend anyone drive this car before considering another manufacturer. I have fallen in love."
jaguar,xf,2010,Michael, 04/10/2019,I thought it was a great product!,1,"Bottomline stay away. I got a 2010 Xf Premium with 43k miles from the original owner. It had been under warranty it's whole life. Also, paid for dealership to do an inspection on it and it came back with a clean bill of health. Only 13,000 miles into ownership. TWO Airbag sensors randomly went faulty, cost of repairs $1800. Front suspension is full of cheap rubber bushings that dry out and when they do, the steering wheel shakes. The infotainment screen upfront that controls nearly everything - freezes all the time. Dealer did update and sais nothing is wrong. Reverse camera works when it wants to. Leather dash board is beginning to wealt. A speaker suddenly was blown...all I listen to is NPR at low volumes! There is more things, bottomline - it's one of those cars that things just break without warning. And/or there is something always wrong with it. Stay away from Jaguar. They won't stand behind their product and will charge for things they should cover even when out of warranty. Suchas airbag sensors! They are beautiful cars but so is Lexus. I regret my decision for trying to get something different. Save yourself, don't buy jaguar unless it's under a warranty - and expect for it to be at the shop a lot. Beautiful cars, horrible reliability and use cheap parts where the consumer can't see. Poorly built cars - wrapped in beautiful design. I've had their Loaner and drove the new XE and that car is full of the same issues with backup camera and very cheap plastic interior. I will never buy into Jaguar again as you should not. I never wright reviews, but I am because when I did the research - the internet was full of reviews about how great and reliable they are just like a toyota. I question the credibility of the reviews and just wish I would have read a review like mine to save me from this headache of a car.

jaguar,xf,2010,Birmingham Man, 08/14/2010,Former Jag Lover,2,"I test drove a 2010 XF about a year ago and it felt solid and drove well. I was impressed. I decided to take out a 4 year lease. Little did I know the problems that await less than a week later. From the check engine light to squeaks and rattles, this car has been a nightmare to own. In the first 2 months it spent 40 days in the shop. It is not ""screwed and glued"" together well at all. Now after almost a year I can truly say it is the worst car I've ever owned. Jaguar USA was no help. I felt completely helpless after talking to them. The car just sits in the garage, rarely driven because I'm not sure what will break next, additionally, squeaks and rattles still run rampant."

Not a fuel efficient car, as I have the premium 2010 5.0 V-8 model.
But wow, the power and refinement is top-notch performance and far beyond my 2006 Audi A6 ever delivered.


I seldom write feedback, but have to say the Jag is still one of the best looking and uniquely undiscovered cars on the road.
If you don't follow the herd, check this offering out.
Even now, I am so happy to walk out to my car and ""drive"".

I am coming from a new generation Porsche 911, and I was very concerned about being let down by the performance of the XFR. Well, it is just the opposite.  I am enamored with the XFR.  This car is fast, handles great, and has so many different personalities depending upon the driving mode, that it simply blows the 911 away.  This car will likely be compared with the M5 and the E63 (plus maybe some offerings from Audi).  However, this car is in a league of its own.  The others may perform better in certain areas, but they just do not come close to being the overall performer that is the XFR."

Problems ranged from the mundane (faulty cabin light that would turn on when I make a sharp right-turn), to the comical (door windows that would automatically re-open when you want it closed¬óreminiscent of a ¬ëThree Stooges¬í show), to the seriously annoying (a creaking sound from the windshield that took several visits to diagnose and eventually fix).

Apart from this I had some wind noise that was fixed (moon roof not sealed), stain on the roof cloth, 1  the dealer could not remove, USB key had to reinserted sometimes (loose connection - fixed), preset station on the SAT radio erased (fixed), Blackberry sometimes need to reconnect (not fixed), signal light not returning correctly (fixed)...

The dealer took it back and gave me a new one.  That one has been in the service department five times already.  Oh, and I have also had to buy 3 new tires since they don't tell you the 19 inch tires should only be driven on smooth country lanes not city streets. One pothole and you need a new tire. Awful customer service and nasty superiors.  Buyer Beware!  Stay Away!"
jaguar,xf,2010,Ron Taylor, 05/07/2010,GREAT RIDE,4,"I have a 2003 S Type R jag that has been the greaetest sedan I've ever owned including BMW.  This year I looked again at BMW, Mercedes E Class and the Buick Lacrosse...  Felt that the Jaq had all of them beat in many areas and so far I am not dissapointed. I think the Buick had the best electronics, lighting, and price...but power and front wheel drive left me cold.  "
jaguar,xf,2010,Rob, 08/13/2010,One Bad Cat,4,"I have owned this car for a little over a year now and all I can say is WOW. Jaguar is back with a vengeance. Look out BMW, AUDI,and MB, you have some strong competition out there. This car is a bad cat."
jaguar,xf,2010,Robert, 07/22/2017,Comfort and cruising.,5,"100,000 miles on the car, no major issues. A leak in the coolant system fixed locally and a recall. Tons of piwer. I have no interest in all the cars with a 2.0 4'cyl. I got my honking V8 and love it.Very comfy in front, back pretty tight for long ride. Sharp looks outside, beautiful dash layout. Nav system too fussy. No major issues with this car. Been in mountains with snow/ice does fine with anti skid feature. Repairs are expensive, but fortunately are few and far between. Due to mileage I've been looking at a newer car, but most I've seen have interiors either black or grey. Depressing. My interior has shades of brown and tan leather, carbon fiber, wood, chrome it's beautiful. I never did figure out the have system, but don't really need it. Hanging onto my Jag, baby!

jaguar,xf,2010,Maria , 07/16/2010,Bad brake pads,4,"Don't buy Jaguar XF 2010 unless you want to fix brake pads every 10,000 miles at $350.00 and buy new tires at $380.00 each every 10,000 milea. It is a beautiful car but too expensive to maintain."
jaguar,xf,2010,Dallas, 12/08/2009,Love This Car!,4,"I just leased the 2010 XF luxury in Porcelain with the tan interior.  It is gorgeous and I've received a ton of compliments.  I had the dealer paint the back bottom bumper piece the same Porcelain color and it looks SWEET! (It comes with that piece unpainted).  The XFR is the only model that comes from the factory with it already paint matched.  Worth the extra $200. I also got the dealer installed Chrome Package which comes with 18 chrome wheels, Chrome side air vents, chrome rearview mirror covers and dark tinted windows.  This makes the car stand out from the pack. CHECK THIS CAR OUT!"
jaguar,xf,2010,decajun45, 06/29/2009,Glad I waited!,4,"I got my XFR a couple of weeks ago and all I can say is I love it.  I saw the XF when it first came out, test drove it, and decided that was the car I wanted.  Then I heard Jag was making the XFR and decided to wait for it.  I am happy I did.  The car is comfortable, stylish, and handles great.  I drove it over retired railroad tracks when I was test driving it and didn't know it until I was on my way back to the dealership.  The fuel economy is decent considering it has a 510 HP engine.  I've had people look at me when I pass them and I've left Mustang GTs at the light (3Xs).  This thing wants to go fast.  Oh, and guys, take it from my experience.  This thing is a chick magnet!"
jaguar,xf,2010,PCardali, 07/07/2009,Pick of the Litter,4,I fell in love with this car at the Detroit Auto Show in January.  Having test driven the XF SC I knew this car would be special.  The car's best attributes rest in the driving dynamics of the vehicle.  The massive torque and power this car has is amazing for not only the sheer force but how easy it is to access it.  The handling in the real world is fantastic.  Some may say X car is faster in the slalom or Y car creates more lateral G's in the skid test.  But in the real world 99.9% of the time you will be on public roads and this car has the performance AND comfort that few others can match. Plus this Beast gave me 24mpg on my long distance highway trip. I'm blessed to own this car.
jaguar,xf,2010,jc2009, 11/15/2009,No Leaper Required,4,"My fourth Jag and by far the most fun to drive. Leaper is fine for the XJ series but looks out of place on this one. Drives like a true sports sedan and looks better than the BMW, Benz and Audi models. Initial quality for the first 70 days has been disappointing. Second day after purchase  back at the dealer for engine light and last week a first for the dealer as the electronic parking brake engaged and refused to disengage causing the back wheels to lock. Dealer prompt on repairs but Jaguar Roadside told me I had to figure out how to get home when the car was towed, not a fun experience. At the end of the day, Jaguars are like problem children, we usually wind up forgiving them."
jaguar,xf,2010,Snurt, 11/17/2009,Faster Pussycat Has Arrived,4,"It's hard to decide what's most to like about my XF: the exterior (simply perfect), the interior (expensive leather and wood + high tech toys), or the performance (responsive brakes, easy steering, and TREMENDOUS power).  This car is a superbly styled, high performance work of art.  Just hope the reliability holds up over the years (so far so good)."
jaguar,xf,2010,Julie, 01/12/2010,Mixed Feelings,4,"My husband really loves the look of the new XF style. The car performs well and looks cool inside and out. However, it is difficult to start the car sometimes with this keyless technology. There has been one recall on the car already.  Now the gas gauge on the dashboard does not work.  The Jaguar service is really poor, at least where I live.  For the price of the car and the service I received, I am not sure I would lease another Jaguar again."
jaguar,xf,2010,LazBro123, 06/05/2010,WOW,4,"Wow, this is one impressive car.  I test drove its competitors, just to compare.  Those cars are bland in comparison.  This Jag takes luxury and performance to the next level.  The interior is paradise.  I feel like sleeping there during the night.  The exterior is beautiful too.  Also, the fuel economy is quite good, in it's class.  I love this car.  I recommend you to buy this car! You will not be disappointed in any way!"

jaguar,xf,2010,RICH HARRIS, 08/13/2009,Nice looking but awful reliability,2,"I decided to lease this car because of it's sleek looks and nice interior. However, after having this car only a week, the famous Jaguar reliability came through...with less than 500 miles on the odometer, the car conked out in the middle of the Long Island Expressway!  Needless to say, I'm lucky to be writing this right now.  The car was a complete lemon.  The sensor to the fuel pump told it that I had no gas, even though there was almost half a tank so the fuel pump shut down.   Absolutely horrible experience...I don't even want to look at another Jag."
jaguar,xf,2010,Mark, 07/01/2010,Amazing Jag,5,"Have been a BMW owner for 9 years, currently have two, but was looking for something different and fun to drive. This car fit the bill. Welcome back Jaguar. They did a great job with this car. From fit to finish. Looked at MB, Lexus, Audi and infiniti. Best bang for the buck. "
jaguar,xf,2010,Ms. Dallas, 05/04/2010,"Great car, but tires are a disaster",4,"I love my XF -R but I am totally turned off by the tires.  Haven't even had the car a year and two tire problems.  The first was a chunk of missing tire on my back driver side.  Nothing hit the car - I'm the only driver - so was very surprised to see this.  Dealer said I needed to get a new one - over $600. Okay, I'll chalk that up to a fluke. Well, 3 months later, the front passenger tire has a couple of bulges in the sidewall. Take it in and am told I hit a pot hole. BS!  I've had no incident.  The dealership makes me feel like I'm a liar.  Tells me the tires are ""low profile"" and can't handle pot holes. Nonsense!  There is definitely a tire problem with this car."
jaguar,xf,2010,Jaguar Purist, 11/10/2009,Real Performance... Real Luxury,5,"I leased my new XF before the lease expired on my Mercedes E350.  I always felt the MB was a poor value, but I had no idea how poor until I got this new Jaguar.  The 5.0 liter engine that seems to have unlimited torque.  This car will pin you backside to the seat when opened up.  The ride and handling must be experienced as no words exist to describe the road manners of this car!   The interior redefines luxury.  Ian Callum improved on the refinements of the Aston Martins he designed and put them in this car.  I love the start button that pulses like a heartbeat! Very clever. Every aspect of this car is superb."

jaguar,xf,2010,B. Bronov, 06/21/2009,You CAN buy fun,4,"For my first Jag, I couldn't have picked a better model. This is easily the finest car I've had the pleasure to drive, and I certainly count myself as among the lucky to own one. Almost every aspect of this exudes quality and workmanship. The styling, both interior and exterior, are classic, sexy and just aggressive enough to be noticed. The ergonomics of the cabin are well thought out, aside from one or two minor mis-steps. The touchscreen is brilliant, and after climbing the learning curve, so is the voice command system. The seats are comfortable, and odd that I even noticed it, so is the steering wheel."
jaguar,xf,2010,murrayr1, 06/23/2009,"Buy it, if you can find one!",5,"I have owned many cars in my life from luxury sedans to exotics. This is by far the best balance automobile I have driven. I first tested it on a track w/ professional drivers and was hooked. Jaguar has certainly made a statement about their desire to re-establish themselves as a quality brand. We had a deposit on the Panamera. No way that car is worth 30k more than this. And, the XFR comes fully loaded, no options necessary. I'd put it up against anything up to 120k."
jaguar,xf,2010,Cliff, 06/26/2009,Purrrrrrrrfection,4,"Picked up my xfr two days ago. Such a perfect balance of  handsome beauty -  well mannered understatement and EXPLOSIVE POWER!!!!!!!!!  Nothing I have driven before has ever come close to this. BMW 550, M5, 750; Mercedes S550, E65, Audi S4, 5 and 6 all fade by comparison.  I thought I had found the optimal automotive balance with my BMW550... but not today. The xfr is the epitome of elegantly understated design and scientifically honed POWER!  Today the cat reigns supreme. It is Purrrrrrrfection.  I've lived in the US for nearly 20 years... Today the Xfr makes me proud to be English. Well done Jaguar you have created a MASTER PIECE!!!"
jaguar,xf,2010,gastank, 08/05/2009,A meow with lots of WoW,4,"Awesome, ride, handling, and performance.  Looks great and very functional.  Huge trunk, folding seats and very useful.  Fast doesn't have to be useless.  There is not one on every corner either.  Nice"
jaguar,xf,2010,wh1tby, 08/20/2009,Amazing new Jag,4,"Excellent ride, performance and handling. Definitely not like the Jags of yore. Jury still out on reliability (I have not owned it long enough) but delivery quality excellent. Moved from BMW 5 series which was a tough move. Car attracts attention due to its looks, but this car gives me BMW performance with superb road presence."
jaguar,xf,2010,2010xf-Prem, 09/08/2009,Premium hits the sweet spot,4,"Jag has been a dream car for my wife and with both kids out of college, we could justify another year of tuition/room/board (what's one more...)  Tried to satisfy ourselves with the base XF, and were actually looking for left- over 09. Not many around. Anyway, the combination of color and features made us buy the Premium Luxury. Have been studying the manual, (which is quite thick) for the myriad features. Would have actually preferred 18"" wheels- more rubber= better ride comfort. the 19"" standard wheels look much better though and ride is great."
jaguar,xf,2010,love my jag, 09/15/2009,Love my XFR,5,I just picked my 2010 XFR and love it; a rocket on wheel with a luxury drive. The only negative; there is only one outlet and 3 cupholders in front ??? I wish you would have two outlets in front or the option to have a cigarette lighter that would solve this small annoyance; you can't plug your cell phone and a radar detector. I also cannot see contact name downloaded from my blackberry; only numbers.
jaguar,xf,2010,k man, 11/14/2009,WOW!!,5,"Love this car. Beautiful, fun, spirited and refined. Traded my BMW 545 which was starting to look like every other car. This car is faster, easier to use (yuck to the idrive) and more elegant. Not quite as athletic but so much more beautiful inside and out. And the xf premium is an out of the box VALUE, loaded w standard features. I love all the touch switches and my glovebox works right. The integrated phone and ipod works great- no prob w my blkberry. Nav is simple to use and fantastic. I find the central touch screen easy to operate and rather intuitive. But best of all, this car wants to GO and is fun to drive. I got the lunar grey w charcoal- looks fab."
jaguar,xf,2010,Rich, 11/18/2009,What a Car!!!,4,Totally love this car. Can't spend enough time behind the wheel.  I am impressed by how smooth this car is. The acceleration is quick but velvet like. The interior is very functional and clean with all the major functions at your finger tip. No complex array of buttons or IDrive here.  Quality of fit and finish is class leading especially with the portfolio package. It enhances an already superb cabin.  B&W sound is outstanding. This car turns heads and gets lots of compliments.
jaguar,xf,2010,robertm, 11/30/2009,I love it!,4,I purchased the XF Premium three weeks ago and have been extremely pleased with the car. It looks and sounds great. It holds the road better than my 2007 535 BMW. It has numerous features like blind spot radar and cooled seats as standard. I just took the car on a 700 mile Thanksgiving roadtrip to New York City. The car made the trip much more pleasant even through heavy traffic and bad roads. This car is a winner!! 
jaguar,xf,2010,robertm, 12/27/2009,Winter driving,4,"Following last week's winter storm, the streets in our area were not plowed and turned into 4-5 inches of rough ice. I did not expect much of the ""winter driving"" button on the console, and was very pleasantly surprised to see that the car (with winter tires) drove as well as our VW Jetta. My hats off to Jaguar!"
jaguar,xf,2010,chriw, 12/31/2009,2010 Jag XF Premium Review,4,Very fun car to drive with good looks to match. Nice engine growl and strong performance. Good braking. Interior style impresses with a few fun features such as vents opening upon start up.
jaguar,xf,2010,NashJag, 01/31/2010,Loving it!,5,"I traded a Porsche 911 for this car, and I am so incredibly happy.  The Jaguar is a wonderful car to drive with plenty of power and a luxurious interior.  Some of the high-tech features seem a touch gimmicky to me, but I am getting used to it.  The navigation and bluetooth are both easy to use, and I absolutely love the British-accented navigator's voice that is so beautiful to hear and so perfect for this British car.  I am also excited to be in a car that is less commonly seen around town.  With BMW's and Mercedes-Benz's everywhere, the Jaguar is much more distinctive and interesting.  You lose nothing by opting for the Jaguar over these other brands."
jaguar,xf,2010,jeff, 02/11/2010,great car,4,"I was a bit tentative about trading my bmw 5 series for this jaguar...loved the bmw but it was moving toward 50k and time for a new toy....well to say i am ecstatic would be putting it mildly..this car is simply great..yes i can nitpick, for example, i have been having problems with the satellite radio...pre-set channels just seem to dissapear, so im not sure if its the unit in the vehicle or something to do with the sat. signal...and i would think they could have made the nav. system a tad quicker to maneuver around..aside from those little things, this car is exceptional..i was concerned with a rear wheel drive in the snow, but with the snow tires and winter mode,no problem in heavy snow..."
jaguar,xf,2010,Harvey, 03/26/2010,XF Premium Portfolio Pakage,4,"After one week of ownership I love the looks and the power of the car. I traded a 2005 Acura RL which was a great car and I have absolutely no complaints about it. It was reliable and had a beautiful interior but kind of unexciting exterior. I hope the Jag is as reliable as from past reputation they had issues. My dealer is Alpine the largest in the country. The building is beautiful and the sale was professional from the moment i entered the dealership. So far, I highly recommend them."
jaguar,xf,2010,Jim, 03/29/2010,Get One - You Too will be Convinced,5,"I cannot begin to tell you how many times I read about Jaguar's spotty reliability, problems from other owners on this site and several other sources.  Still, after 10 years of very high satisfaction with MB, BMW, and Audi, I had reached the point of boredom with my cars.  I'm 43, and perhaps right at the target market for this XF, and decided a week ago to pull the trigger on a 3 year lease.   I've had buyer's remorse on other purchases simply because I wasn't sure I made the right decision.  But this car is COMPLETELY different.  No such remorse.  It is a joy to drive.  I get a thrill every time I press the ignition button and step on the gas.  First rate design and build quality.  "
jaguar,xf,2010,R Moreau, 04/22/2010,Great Car,4,"Purchased a 2010 Premium Luxury with Portfolio package and rear DVD system. The more I drive it the more I like it. This car is so smooth on the road that it is easy to loose sense of the speed you are going at. Some owners may complain about the screen interface, I find it easy and intuitive to use compare the german competitors. The inside is simple and clean as well as very luxurious. I especially enjoy the Bower and Wilkins sound system, the smooth effortless power delivered by the V8 5.0. Unlike some other competitors I test drove it never seems to run out of steam. The exhaust note is to die for. The XF delivers pure driving pleasure in a luxurious environment. "
jaguar,xf,2010,Gene, 05/06/2010,Excellent Choice,4,"After test driving the Audi A6, Benz E350, MKS,BMW 7, and Lexus 460 this was the nicest vehicle for my use, just driving.  Exterior styling is the most striking of any boring offering I drove.  The interior styling and materials are beautiful,  There is unneed complexity in the other cars.  This car combines class styling and performance.  The A6 was my second choice. It had a lighter steering feel and a better NAV system.  So what, I usally know where I'm going and dont like to talk to a machine that much.  This car looks great and is so pleasing to drive. If you don't want to feel great driving this car and listening to the Bower & Wilkins sound system then buy one of the competiton. "
jaguar,xf,2010,wolf, 05/05/2010,16 months of pure joy,4,"Bought my car last year, haven't had any problems, vastly more reliable than my Volvo.  Love the looks, comfort, and general feeling of being special.  Not so many on the road so folks take notice.  Good highway gas mileage, 27- 28 if I'm cruising at a relaxed pace of 70 mph.  Can't help wondering how much better the 5.0 liter engine would be.  "
jaguar,xf,2010,JPJAG, 05/17/2010,2010 Jaguar XF Premium,5,"I had 3 BMWs in a row before I made the leap to Jaguar. I am so happy that I did. My 2010 Jaguar XF Premium is a pleasure to drive. I cannot tell you how many people stop me to tell me how much they like the looks of the car.I tell them..""if you like the looks, you should drive it,too."" Gone are the days of the old Jags with hit & miss reliability.Jaguar hit a home run with this car. No doubt about it."
jaguar,xf,2010,VeniceNC, 05/28/2010,Different is Good,4,"Looked at E550, 550i, and M56 before buying the XF. Power is awesome, faster than the factory reported 4.9 to 60. Great design and different from BMW/Merc, really gives a sense of luxury and yet is a total sleeper in performance. My only concern in buying the Jaguar was reliability - no problems to report after a month though so maybe the demons are history. Super smooth ride but also handles well. The hockey puck transmission shifter is really a good idea, takes up a lot less room - why do you need a big stick on an automatic? Navigation and touchscreen are a bit slow and dated, but I don't use them much so not bothersome. No buyers remorse here, I'd buy again and recommend  the XF highly."
jaguar,xf,2010,cjv, 06/08/2010,"A few nits, but an outstanding car.",4,"I came out of an Infiniti M35x and did extensive research and test drove the competition (E550, 5 series, M37). It wasn't even close. Yeah, the M37 had more technology, but didn't drive as well & had much less power. The BMW is great if I was on a track, but a non- starter if I wanted to be comfortable on long road trips on Wisconsin roads. The E550 had a magnificent interior and ride, but I didn't like the exterior styling. Minutes after taking the M37 for one last test spin, I took the Jag 5.0 out again. It's one of the few cars I've ever driven that got the adrenalin pumping (in Sport Mode). Great performance is on par with anything in its class, and it's much sexier looking."
jaguar,xf,2010,TomS, 07/22/2010,Love (almost) everything about it,4,"Had car almost 2 mos and so far it's a really great.  Styling is equal to or better than any sedan out there (Bentleys, etc. excepted). Also, don't see yourself coming and going like BMW and MB.  Engine, transmission and performance are so smooth. Trans in manual mode very quick. Gobs of power. Handles well in normal mode but really need to go to Sport and Dynamic mode to really experience what the car can do. Interior is  beautiful and very comfortable and quiet. Some controls and displays rather quirky, like the Navi does not re-calculate route and some controls require too many steps. Otherwise, fantastic car."
jaguar,xf,2010,AJMarton, 09/19/2010,Great Car and Fantastic Value....,4,"I have an LR2 coming off lease and was considering the Jag XF, Audi A6, Mercedes E350 and BMW 335 or 5 series as my next car.  I also have a 2000 XJ8 so I was a little concerned about build quality and reliability.  I ultimately chose the XF because of its unique styling.  There are so many BMWs and Mercedes in LA that I wanted something different for my $50k.  The XF is definitely a head turner and I love the body styling.  Reminds me of the Austin.  It also has a well appointed interior with all the bells and whistles you can ask for.  I was really turned off by the fact that most of the options I wanted were extra on the BMW.  The performance is also amazing and you can really tweak it."

jaguar,xf,2010,David, 04/30/2019,150k and still as strong as day 1,5,"I have over 150k in miles aside of electrical issues like the window motor the ECU and a few other annoying issues...the engine and trans on the 4.2 is better than any car I have ever owned.. at 90k I changed the plugs...I do the oil every 10k....upgraded the brakes to vented and slotted rotors and put in a cool air intake. The car sat for about 20 days as I bought a new car and it started right up....no rough idle at 30 degrees...its one of the better small block V8 motors and the 6 speed trans is faultless. The leather seats are high quality as the drivers seat has minimal wear...I mean hardly noticeable and very comfortable still....book values is about 7k, and anyone would be crazy not to buy a luxury V8 for such a low price....I'll probably sell it for 5k and whoever gets it will be a lucky individual.  I'm an idiot for buying an extended warranty.  There is still 40k left and I have not used it except for roadside assistance....ran out of gas like an idiot. I'd much rather give this car to one of my kids but they all say it's too much of a car for them...gas wise size etc. Anyway I cant speak for the 5.0 engine or the supercharged engine but the base 4.2 is a great motor. I think there is at the very least 75k miles left.....if your thinking of buying a used XF....go for it. The car upon test driving should be immediately responsive with heavy torque and smooth shifting even at 200k...great car...one of the best I have owned...they stopped putting the 4.2 in the xf...guess why...its just a damn reliable motor with an active life of at least 150k and I'm sure much more ahead.

jaguar,xf,2010,JW, 08/01/2020,Long time owner but finally gave up,3,"This was my first jag. I originally wanted something that could fit 4 comfortably, was unique and fast. Didn‚Äôt take long for the XF to come up in my Google search back in 2012. Unfortunately, there was very little history with this model back then but I still took a chance.  Here I am 8 years later and I‚Äôve just sold my favorite* car to drive. *but the MOST unreliable. I cannot overstate this. I have never had a car in the shop so much as my Jag. You name it and it broke down; usually at the worst times. 

If I could extract the unreliable nature from my experience with this car, it would be 5 stars all day long. The performance and handling of this car were second to none. The Supercharged is a BEAST with an elegant look.  I can‚Äôt tell you how many LOUD egotistical Mustang drivers I left in the dust!!  Even the Cobra‚Äôs.  Didn‚Äôt matter if it was off the line or from a 60 mph ‚Äústart‚Äù.  There were even some sub Z06 vette‚Äôs i saw in the rear view.  BUT....sigh... at the end of the day, I finally sold it (yesterday) after far too many breakdowns. The horrible (but laughable) part was within 5 minutes after selling it, the new owner called to ask why the trunk cap had fallen off - I wanted to say it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a Jag you idiot - but she‚Äôll figure it out eventually.

I never thought I would buy a Jaguar.  I had seen some new ads and the cars looked great, but I had heard such bad things about the reliability issues.  I try to buy a late model used car because I think it makes good financial sense.  I will buy new if I can't  find a used car with all of the options I want. While looking at Mercedes I stumbled upon a 2011 XF.  Decided to drive it and that was all I needed.  Still under factory warranty and has three certified years after that.  Love this car, love driving again."
jaguar,xf,2011,Greg, 11/17/2018,Jaguar XF 2011,4,"Parts are really hard to get from the after market. I own two BMW also the parts are easy to find. Other than that I really love this car. It handles great has all the power you could use in a real world environment. Well made a lot better than older versions. Eats brakes Quickly but that‚Äôs not a real problem if you can service your own car. In 37000 miles I‚Äôve had three problems a plastic cooling tube that almost fried the engine. Wasn‚Äôt that costly to fix myself. A battery and alternator. Which I would say is nothing but basic things you will encounter with any  vehicle.

Completely unacceptable and more so for a dealer attempting to charge $3200.  My first and last Jaguar. Fun as hell to drive...expensive as hell to fix!

jaguar,xf,2011,DontBuyJag, 05/31/2019,Do not buy this car,1,"Jaguar should be ashamed. I have only owned high end cars and this car has been a money pit. Car has 45,000 miles and has had to have the following replaced: alternator, water pump and neck; valve gasket; vacuum pump and has had a host of electronic issues. Always  babied snd garage kept. Have had $6500 in repairs the last 2 years alone. My family has the same car and has similar problems with it. We will never buy another one which is a shame because the car is do pretty snd we love driving it. Don‚Äôt get me wrong. We have always paid $$$$$ for regular servicing but to have these very expensive needless repairs due to cheaply made parts at such low mileage is outrageous. Not to mention it taking two years of continual persistence to get any reasonable reply from the manufacture. Very poor customer service loyalty.

jaguar,xf,2011,chriw1, 02/26/2011,2010 XF review,4,This car is fun to drive and a beauty to look at. I waited 15k miles to give you an accruate review of the car. The engine has a nice growl to it and is quick off the mark
jaguar,xf,2011,Albie, 06/18/2010,Never thought I would by a Jag,4,"I have Had my XFR since may and I love it. I had a 2009 Porsche 4S Previous to the Jag.  My Friends thought I was crazy to go from the Porsche to the Jag. I have had no regrets. I had a 2006 CLS AMG 55 which I loved and the Jag is very similar to that car, except the Jag is quicker and more refined all around."
jaguar,xf,2011,Jerry RIchard, 06/11/2020,1ST new Jaguar,5,"I had heard reviews that Jaguar was terrible at maintenance and actually bought a used one which created all kinds of issues however I liked the new design so I bought a 2011 XF S. I now have over 75000 miles and have NEVER had any issues other then the battery for the fob and brakes wearing out quickly. Maintenance at dealership has been great. This car is not your grandma's jaguar, it's fast, styling is beautiful and the interior is excellent. So, reading the reviews, it's amazing to see a few really got a dog. Must have been the time the builders were out all night drinking. Mine has been the best car I've purchased ever."
jaguar,xf,2011,amduscious, 07/20/2012,"A very fun, stylish, and satisfying car to drive",5,"I bought my 2011 XF Supercharged in June 2011 and I have absolutely no regrets.
 I have not had to take it in except for its annual checkup at 10K miles - there have been no mechanical or electrical issues at all.
It has more power than I can use 99% of the time, and I always look forward to that 1% when I can give her all she has got....which is a lot with that powerhouse 470HP Supercharged V8.
 I wasn't even going to buy a new car, but when the dealer parked it and kept it running, that purr from the quad exhaust was more temptation then I could shake.

jaguar,xf,2011,drjp, 12/12/2010,After Months of Research I found my Car,5,"I researched just about every luxury in the 50-60K range. MB, BMW, Lexus, and Audi.
For me it came down to the Jag and the Audi.
When I test drove the Jag it was not like any of the others.
To steal a quote from an automotive reviewer, this car is like the beautiful cheerleader with a naughty side.
Step on the gas and it just goes, and goes and keeps going.
Plus everywhere I go people have to do a double take its such a beautiful car.
A word about value...This car has EVERYTHING in it already, its German counterparts should learn a lesson from the Brits.
I priced out a BMW and MB that started around 50K, by the time you add all the xtras (just about everything) the car is well over 60"

The quality of the interior, the handling, the sound of the V8 all seemed superior by comparison. The lease numbers were also good.  Great car and I have owned all the luxury sedans."
jaguar,xf,2011,vaznayak, 04/25/2015,"Horrible quality, only exceeded by worse service",3,"UPDATE:  Finally got rid of the car!!!  Leaks developed in the car (through the windshield).  For several months Jaguar kept fixing and replacing many parts of the car - claiming 1 thing after another was leaking (I told them i suspected the windshield, but they said that was not possible).  After 6 months of trying to fix the leak, they finally looked at the windshield, and confirmed that the leaks were indeed coming from there.  By then the car had gotten so badly damaged due to water, that my insurance company took the car off our hands, and we didn't have to go through the hassle of selling it.  During all this time, the dealership provided us with a loaner - initially a lousy, small Hyundai, and then after I made some noise, an equivalent Jag.  Often we waited days or weeks to get simple repairs done.  They would give me an appointment, and then take 3 days just to take a look at the car, and then wait weeks for parts to arrive.  In fact our insurance company had better follow ups with us on the repairs than the dealership did.  I finally had to meet with the GM of the dealership to discuss the situation, and even sent them an invoice for MY time lost coming in to the dealership and chasing after them.

While we loved driving the Jag, the hassles of owning one were not worth it.  We ended up buying a Porsche and a Tesla and it has been an amazing experience - great customer service, and fantastic drives - Porsche better than the Tesla!, though the Tesla has its plusses.  

OLD REVIEW:  We've now owned this car, bought new, for 3.5 yrs, and have under 18,000 miles on it.  By now, a significant portion of the car has been replaced by Jag - including several internal lights, the entire fuel system, parts of the audio system, and most recently all the carpeting and even the front seats.....and they're still not done!!!  There's still more they need to work on.  And even that's not the worst part.

What is absolutely the worst is the level of customer service.  Take the car in for work, and then I have to follow up for an update.  It typically takes 6-8 weeks to get replacement parts, and involves several follow ups.  Amazing that they are still in business.

The new XF is truly extraordinary. The feel is luxurious while the performance keeps you glued to your seat. People stop me all the time to take a look at it or just compliment me on the curvaceous styling. As soon as you sit in it, you know from the moment you push the START button that you are in for a truly unique experience. This car is one of the best cars I have ever driven. The affordability factor makes it difficult to justify purchasing and ""comparable"" vehicle in any luxury line (as if there is anything even remotely comparable out there!)"

No other vehicle had the same level of trim, performance and outright fun factor for anything close to the price.
In fact, in most instances, the cost was several thousands more.
The only drawback is that it does not have a 4-wheel drive option, which can be an issue in the Northeast, especially this past winter.
Nevertheless, I would not trade it for any of the 4-wheel drive options out there."

I test drove the 2011 Jaguar XF, the 2011 Mercedes E550, E350, Infinity, Audi A6, BMW 530 and 2011 Ford Taurus SHO and had to go back for another test drive of the XF Premium. The XF Premium really did it for me. I

Well that day came true and I can't believe how disappointed I have been with this car. Getting this car may perhaps be the worst decision I have every made! First off... brakes squeak all day long. You know the sound of a crappy old NY cab. Well the cab is more tolerable believe it or not. Then to top it off you'll be dishing out $600 to $1,000 every 10k miles to have them replaced. Also the electronics are a joke. Hard to give specifics because that would take all day. Let's just say... it must be running on an old version of Windows 98.

Here are just a few examples of the insanity.
iPod has 4000 songs.
Plug it in and control of the unit switches to the touch screen.
No alpha search on the touch screen even though the iPod does have search, which you now can't access.
Want to hear some ZZ top?
Scroll thru the entire catalog 20 songs at a time.
Three dealers say, ""that's just the way they are.""
Next, can't use nav while moving, in contrast to most of the competition.

The dealership can't figure it out. It's hard to believe that after 3 or 4 days of not being driven the car won't start. Some of the possible causes I've been given from the service people make no sense. If you're looking to buy this car, ask others who have one before moving.    "
jaguar,xf,2012,adityab, 04/22/2012,A different breed for sure,4,"A bit of background to help frame my take on the XF: Nearly everything I've driven in the past has had two doors, and performance has always been paramount (past cars include an S2000 and a 328i). 

The XF is clearly a departure. It's large, plush, and gadget laden. Still, the car certainly satisfies my need for speed. It strikes a solid balance between the ability to carve canyons and coddle. I've been a die-hard BMW fan for years, and the decision to throw my hat into Jaguar's ring was the product of considerable research and multiple test-drives against the 528i (similar lease rate). The 5 is a fine car, but the Jag is more car (and more muscle) for the money."

jaguar,xf,2012,Ren, 08/18/2016,I wish I could love this car more but....,4,"A few months after purchasing the vehicle used with 45k miles a coolant leak developed. Lucky me because this happened at 49k miles and it has a 4 year/50k mile warranty. The dealership stood by Jaguar's warranty and helped me. It took 3 trips to the dealer to get it fixed. They ended up replacing the coolant reservoir the first time, the Y pipe the second time, and the 3rd try was the charm having replaced a hose that was leaking. Although frustrating to have those issues and keep having to go back to the dealer, the actual dealership was great to work with and ended up getting it resolved, they gave me a loaner car 2 of the 3 times. That is the type of issue that can happen to any car so I'm not knocking the vehicle TOO much there. The exclusivity, looks, style, used value, etc. on this car are pretty unbeatable. I specifically only looked for 2012's because in 2012 was the first year of the model refresh giving it the unbelievably seductive headlights and tail lights and more refreshes, but 2012 is also the LAST year of the standard 5.0 L V8 motor. Car is great to drive, great to be seen in, comfortable seats, great sound system on the portfolio trim. The brisk, effortless acceleration from the v8 delivers lots of laughs and is high on the giggle meter. Preventative Maintenance costs aren't TOO bad as long as you avoid the dealer for that, I got a full synthetic oil change, fluids topped off, fuel injectors cleaned, 4 wheel-alignment, flat tire repair, different tire installed, and 2 air filters replaced all for $245.  1 problem is the interior build quality has developed a squeak/rattle. I call it an ""expansion and contraction"" rattle because it only rattles/squeaks in hot temperatures or when the car has been in the sun all day..it doesn't rattle at all during the winter or cold mornings. Would I buy a 2012 XF again? Ehh..now that they are out of warranty I'd probably opt for an in-warranty supercharged V6 XF of a later year. Anything major breaking on this Jag out of warranty will be back breaking. Oh one last thing: I don't know if I am idiot...or if this was completely skipped in the building of my spec, but my car does not have child safety anchors. The indicators on the leather seats, that tell you where they should be...point to an area behind the seat that does not have a safety anchor...scratching my head on this one.

Opted for the Portfolio edition, love the interior it is so far above anything else in this price range as to have no competition.
The new seats are even more comfortable, cooled as well as heated, so no more sweaty back when driving in summer heat. I looked at BMW, Merc and Audi, they are all so common and derivative, what a bore to drive one. I like that Jaguar gives so many options in customizing the look: interior colors, choice of veneers, the whole experience is up market."

Acceleration is terrific, near the 5.2 or 5.4 0-60 mph claim. 

I put 18"" wheels and Conti tires because of all of the potholes on Rt 95. I prefer the ride now. the nav isn't all that great, but
it does work. Radio is mediocre. But I bought the car to drive, to shift, to accelerate and to make turns that are amazing for a daily driver. this is better than my Volvo S60R.

jaguar,xf,2012,Jim V, 10/23/2019,A Portfolio to Travel With...,5,"I bought this Jag two years ago and have never regretted it. This model year was the last with a non-turbo V-8 option.  The Portfolio edition has every bell and whistle I care about on the creature comfort side.  The 5.0 liter V-8 provides incredible acceleration.  The cornering and braking are remarkable.  On two lane blacktop country roads, it simply cuts through effortlessly.  I have had zero maintenance issues over two years and 10,000 miles of mostly local and longer distance pleasure driving.  I replaced the original Continental tires with a set of Goodyear Eagle tires and I like the feel as well as the low level of road noise in the cabin.  On long highway trips with the cruise set at 74 mph I average 26 mpg.  Predictably, around town mostly averaging 20-25 mph I only get 16-18 mpg.  I was fortunate to buy this with only 26,000 miles on it.  When I retire in a couple of years I should be right around 40-45,000 miles.  I am betting that this cat will be good for many years of enjoyable driving as my wife and I enjoy our vacations in the southeast."

the Jag handles much better. I have the 3.0 AWD and I have to say much impressed with the power and handling. This car is a lot more sporty handling than the BMW (even though I had the uhp package)
In my opinion, this is an absolutely beautiful machine ,it's tight,taught and perfectly balanced - get the premium package at least - you will not be dissapointed- but, this car does ride tauter than a Lexus,the 535, A6,etc. So, if you are looking for a cushy ride - not.

It is fast, handles very well and, with all wheel drive, suits my driving requirements. I spend time in Los Angeles, but live 100 miles away in the local mountains. The all-wheel drive works flawlessly. (My last car was a Subaru WRX and
the Jag is faster and works just as well in snow). I've always driven manual transmission cars, but the 8-speed auto has won me over. The car is roomy, the interior is elegant and the dash and console design are simple and straight forward without the multiple buttons, dials and lights in German or Japanese luxury sedans. The use of leather and wood trim rather than plastic is a pleasant change."

jaguar,xf,2013,ranger3bn, 01/08/2019,The best of the XF models: XFR,4,"If you are going to get a XF Jaguar then the XFR is the one to get.  I test drove the 2013 XF with the smaller engine and was very disappointed with the level of performance.  I already own a Jeep with AWD so I kind of knew the V6 3.0 AWD model was not going to meet my needs.  However, once I enter the cockpit of the 2013 XFR I was very well impressed with the level of comfort and performance the car gave me.  Most options were already on the car so no need to be left wanting and why would you with 510 HP?  The fit and finish on this car is top notch across the board. As I said before it you want the best that Jaguar has to offer in this model then the XFR or XFR-S is where you want to put your money.  Not really sure why Jaguar did away with the v8 model that was from 2009-2012 on the XF and the XF Super Charged and replaced it with a v6 that has less HP then the older models. However, thank God they still make the XFR and XFR-S to compete with the M5, CLS 63, and Audi S6 and S7. Without the XFR you will definitely be left behind if one of those car pulls next to you.

The ""sport"" mode has great pick up without the annoying lunge/lurch of me BMW 535.  The 3.0 Portfolio upgrade is supercharged, it takes off immediately from a stop - something I didn't like about the standard model.

Interior is incredible by design and the finish is beautiful.  The BMW is so bland in comparison.  Seat comfort is better in the Jag and it just feels like it fits the driver like a glove.  Technology is good and far better than in the 2013 BMW I traded in.  All in all, I couldn't be more satisfied, 3 months and 5000 miles in.  Cheers!

jaguar,xf,2015,Duke Satnick, 11/22/2015,Love the Growl!,5,"After owning Audi and BMW, we decided to try something different and the Jaguar has exceeded our expectations.  From the moment you enter the car, see the start bottom start to pulse, and hit the button, you get this adrenaline rush as the car starts to growl, ready to pounce on its next road victim.  Power at your command, with great handling and cornering without sacrificing luxury.  The sound system is second to none and with an instrumental and navigational panel that is simple and logical to use.  We are dog lovers, but we are extremely pleased with our new cat!

jaguar,xf,2015,Norris Tomlinson, 01/01/2018,Cat Chat,4,"Rear vision is hampered by the stylish low roof line. That deficiency is compensated for to some degree by the cars passing vehicle warning system. The Cat's V-6 supercharged engine provides instant acceleration - a true performance pleasure. Unfortunately performance comes at a price - lousy gas mileage in the 14 to 16 mpg range around town. Though the car doesn't need much service the cost of having it done is extortionate- try an oil change in the $200 range!!  On the positive side the Jag dives like its on rails. Its interior is well appointed with quality materials. The controls are logically placed within easy reach. Instrumentation is good, but misses some of the gages you find on older performance cars - but, then, I'm a lover of the old Jags and other British cars. The driver's seat steering wheel combination has more adjustments to it than Carter has little liver pills.  Leg room is abundant. If you can't find a comfortable driving position you aren't trying very hard. Bottom line: I love the car; hate the dealer imposed cost of ownership.

I was lucky that after 10 mins the car decided to start working again. My car is turning out to be a lemon.  From faulty tire pressure sensors and faulty tires, terrible roadside assistance, the worst.  Terrible support from the delearship.  From my most current situation where my car cannot be properly be fueled without disengaging the gas pump every two seconds when it's being fueled, that makes it almost impossible to refuel at the gas station.  Took it to the Jaguar delearship and they told me they fixed the problem but they didn't, mediocre service up to the point that I want to report this car as a lemon.

This particular model is showing to be a favorite on it's looks alone. I already have people wanting to buy the car from me. turns out the sleeper model is going to show more demand when it comes to resale time. Jaguar did a lot of things right with this one. Go try one out for yourself, they build these cars to sell themselves. make sure the previous owner kept the maintenance up, as with any entry level high performance super car. An additional source you might consider is the Jaguar forum. I had previously owned a BMW M5 and it turned into a money pit. Don't get me wrong I liked the BMW, but I love the JAG.

I wasn't even considering Jaguar as option this go-around, but stopped at the dealership to check out the XE (boy was that TOO small). Then I sat in the XF and realized this was the perfect car (fit and finish). Once I took it for a test drive I was hooked. It feels like a big cat ready to leap out of it's skin! PROS: Acceleration, Exhaust note, Handling, Exterior looks, Interior comfort, Entertainment System, Space for family of 4, Touches of comfort not found in competing German brands, Warranty and Service plan included. CONS: Not many, but I've had a small rattle on the passenger side door, however, Jaguar has been great about isolating and fixing AND the Auto start/stop feature is maddening (just need to get used to turning it off when you start the car). I highly recommend the XF!

jaguar,xf,2016,Linda DeStefani, 01/20/2016,My fast running Jaguar gets me in trouble!,5,"If you like fast wild cats then this car is for you!  I'm about to lose my license because my Jaguar loves to run fast and CHiPs aren't impressed! So, I have 2 reckless-driving speeding tickets I can't ""work off""!  ""Cruising"" (?) down the road, listening to the news, not using my cruse control, I got pulled over outside of Barstow doing 92 MPH!  Even though my speed is posted in the window, I was so unaware that I had reached that MPH that I was shocked!  If Jaguar would maker a noisy, not easy to control/drive car I wouldn't have to hire someone to be ""Driving Miss Linda"" around!  I love my car!  Since there isn't a dealership nearby, there are just a few Jags here which makes it unique.  My car gets a lot of attention because it's styling is wonderful!  I'm so pleased I have camera's everywhere because I can't judge how close or far I am from curbs!  I still haven't tried to learn how to use ""auto park"" and living in a small city area, I  really don't need to.   My car hasn't been in the ""shop"" which is super since the dealer is a 1 1/2 hour distance away.  I tinted the windows which makes the car even more stylish.  The dash instruments are easy to use and more attractive where they're placed.  I needed a BIG trunk and this one is the best!  Both back seats and arm rest bend down so I don't need to ask a handyman to haul things for me .   I previously had a 2009 Jag that was in for repairs"" only once, so I think Jag's reputation is now restored.  I see on T.V. that Queen Elizabeth and others drive Jags so if it's good enough for a queen then it should be just ""the cats meow"" for us!

jaguar,xf,2016,Rob Gordon, 03/16/2018,XF has multiple personalities ‚Äî it's a good thing,4,"I like my Jag's ability to comfortably ease on down the road, eating up the highway... and it can just as quickly be confidently flung around like the sports sedan it is. Other than a quickly resolved transmission issue at delivery, the R-Sport I purchased has been problem-free, back to the dealer only for the free annual services, which I enjoyed paying $0.00 for. It feels so very tight, quick, and nimble. Mine is the 6cyl, mileage is great as long as I'm not in the mood to drive it too aggressively. Stop/start (on all cars now??) complaints are invalid; it's never, not once been a factor at all, and there's a button four inches from your thigh if a situation concerns or bugs you in start/stop traffic. Yeah, the interior is a bit understated, design changes from the prior model are minimal, they could have put a few more bucks into the carpeting. Buy the XF for yourself, for its capabilities, ride quality, and confident feel.  The Adaptive Dynamics are worth it, tightening up if needed, comfortable ride if not. I only wish I'd known about and waited for the wagon version. Update 3/19: It's almost three years since I got my XF, and it hasn't needed any attention beyond than the free annual service visits. 9/19 I've been getting more compliments on the car lately, and I continue to enjoy it, slick and quick.

jaguar,xf,2016,Neha S, 08/10/2017,Price of Prestige,3,"Jaguar, the brand known for prestige and comfort, or at least that's what I thought when I took my business to the dealership to pay the price for a New Jaguar XF. It has only been a year and half since I've owned my vehicle, and although the relationship started off great, it quickly deteriorated. Starting with electrical problems when my windows wouldn't roll down. There are already issues with the spark plugs misfiring, there have been two recalls I've been notified of. It's like paying for a 5 star hotel only to end up with no hot water and dirty sheets in the room.  The embarrassment associated with driving an expensive vehicle I spent a ridiculous amount of money on for such poor quality work makes me feel as if I've been tricked. I feel as if I've paid the price for an emblem, not a car worthy of that price tag.

jaguar,xf,2016,James L, 08/29/2018,"New day, same problem",1,"I have had my Jaguar SF S for a bit over a year. In that timeframe, I have had to take it to Jaguar Fort Lauderdale on 5 separate occasions for the same issue. My rear door retains about a gallon of water each time it rain profusely and each time my car stays in the shop longer only for me to discover the next time it rains, the problem is not solved. The second time they had my car, they even drilled a nice hole on the interior of the door which has never been patched. Each time I call corporate to ask what can be done, I get informed that they will fix it to the best of their ability in relation to my warranty and that I have no other means of recourse. Clearly this isn't within the first 4 times of them trying. The only reason I didn't write this review earlier is because I have an excellent person I see each time named Ken Serra. If it wasn't for him, I would have sold my car and gone to a better dealer/make long ago. I really hope the 5th time is the charm because missing work to drop off my car is getting old.

jaguar,xf,2016,Doc, 06/03/2019,Love this car,5,"This is the best vehicle I have ever owned. After buying a new car every year forever, I have kept this vehicle over 3 years and have no plans to replace it anytime soon. Comfort is excellent, fit and finish is outstanding and the handling is amazing. We live in a rural area with twisting roads and this handles as if on rails. The supercharged 380 horsepower V6 is potent and fast, combined with the 8 speed ZF automatic for lightning smooth shifts. Highway mileage is as high as 30 mpg, mixed driving nets almost 22. Does require premium fuel.  Downside is residual value....after 3 years the vehicle is worth only 40 percent of the sale price. Of course, if it remains in the family, that may matter less.

Really, anyone can siphon gas or contaminate it? It can take a minute or more to have the music start, and even several minutes to enter an address in to the navigation. Backup camera has a warning banner on screen that blocks view long enough to back out of my driveway or parking spaces. It's a beautiful car and drives nice.

jaguar,xf,2017,My 1st Jag, 04/12/2017,The Car to get -- If Driving Matters Most.,5,"Just finished an Audi A6 lease, and was planning to do the easy thing and get into another Audi.  Then....I drove the Jaguar XF.  I first drove a base XF in premium trim, then I drove XF S AWD.  And wow, does the XF S AWD drive! The steering feel, handling, and responsiveness far exceed the Audi and the BMW 5 series.  If you care about the joy of driving, you owe it to yourself to check out the XF.  It just feels lighter and more responsive.  The XF's interior is simple, elegant, uncluttered, reminicent of a comfortable driver's cockpit, which is what I prefer.  It has all the safety nannies like lane departure, blind spot warning, LED headlights, and parking aides.  If you're looking for a more sophisticated and shiny interior, Audi, BMW, and Mercedes is a better place to look.  Finally, the price. The XF S AWD doesn't come cheap, especially the fully loaded models.  I decided to to pick the right color combination with custom wheel appearance package, and forgo many of the optional packages.  By doing this, the MSRP on my XF S AWD was $7-8K lower than the fully loaded ones.   Some dealers (but not all) are willing negotiate, especially at month's end.  Most dealers are discounting the them 3-4K, but if you're patient and timing is right, you can potentially double those savings.   One more thing, it comes with a 5 year, 60K mile warranty, with prepaid maintenance, something Audi and Mercedes doesn't do and BMW does for 1 year and 10K less.

jaguar,xf,2017,Dillon Patel, 02/27/2019,Love and Hate Type of Car,3,"I leased this car in October 2017 because the lease deal was $399 zero down for a $$63,000 car. Has a lot of safety features and the best part is the supercharged engine which is the best part about the car. However after a month of ownership the rear view camera was dangling as well as the rear heated seat component. They were both replaced but the same issue occurred a week later. The speakers were blown which were recently replaced and now the sunroof doesn‚Äôt close. Since there aren‚Äôt many jaguar dealerships in N.J. it is hard to get an appointment with a loaner car."
jaguar,xf,2017,Jhill, 06/08/2019,Very satisfied,5,"Have had this car for 2 years now. Overall extremely satisfied with the car. 33mpg on road trips in a car with 340hp is great. Very smooth ride quality. Seats....after two years....are still very supportive. I'm 6'2/240lbs and am very comfortable. Tires have, so far, lasted 28,000 miles which is fabulous. Absolutely no mechanical problems. Had some odd cosmetic issues present at delivery; sales/service was absolutely awesome at handling all of them. The service department at the local dealer is pretty disorganized; not relevant to my enjoyment of the car but will factor in my decision what to get at the end of the lease.

Update-7  months later and just passed 40k miles. Tires just got replaced; probably had a few more miles left on them. No mechanical problems of any kind. Ride quality still excellent. Trunk liner (they call it a gasket) is loose. Took it to a different dealer than mentioned in previous review and they failed at fixing it. Turns out there's a TSB out on this very thing, so will take it to a different dealer at next service. Very satisfied with car and when lease is up  will still consider sticking with Jaguar. Again, though, the service departments so far have been poor. This will factor into my decision. Jaguar USA...if you are listening....you need to get a handle on these service departments.

Update: Lease is over and I absolutely enjoyed the car. No mechanical problems, wear/tear WELL within expectations. Overall MPG was 27. Highest ever was 34. Unfortunately JLR wasn't offering any deals to keep me as a customer. Prices on new XFs were just too high when compared to competitors. Tried to work a deal with a nearby dealer on a nicer XE; sales crew was mostly unresponsive to emails and texts. 

In summary, the car was fantastic, and (based on the car alone) I would probably have stayed Jaguar had I gotten some love.

jaguar,xf,2017,Lee B., 01/24/2018,Great car messed up by shear stupidity,3,"I would give this car a solid 4+ stars, except for 1 thing I just can't overlook ,expecially since it's almost caused me some minor accidents.  There is a MANDITORY idle engine stall built in, I assume someone thought it would save gas mileage.  It seems that it's always on upon starting the engine.  It is ultra sensitive in that it stalls the engine almost immediately upon coming to a stop at a light or even stop sign. Asside from it being ridiculously annoying, and continual additional strain on systems such as the oill pressure issues upon engine starting and such, and flashes the cigerrete lighter power turning on your hone screen if charging, it also has proven to be a saftey hazzard.   It turns itself off while you are navigating into a tight parkign spot !   So NEVER buy a late model jaguar if you live in a big city where parallel parking is reqqquired !   Several times not, I am using the parking sensors to carefully guy myself into a tight spot, gradually inching a little closer and closer to the another vehicle, such as in front of me, and wala - the darn engine shuts off right in the middle !!    you have to fully remove you foot fromt he break to get it to restart, only, now the a) frontal parking sensor has turned off, and b) by fully removing your foot from the break, and as the car auto restarts, it can jump forward a bit... correct - bumping you right intot he car in front of you that you were carefully inching close to.  Goog God.  How did they mess this up ?  WOuld it be too much to ask that they provide a way to optionally turn and keep it off - for the sake of saftey ?  (not to mention the extreme annoyace it brings).  THis in it self is reason enough to me not to buy a jaguar until this fix this...

jaguar,xf,2017,Chris, 03/03/2018,"World Class in So Many Ways, BUT",4,"I love this car!  The dealership (Aristocrat Motors, in the Kansas City area) was a world class experience.  Fantastic driving experience, comfort, and economy of fuel.  Far more powerful car than my previous car (2011 Buick LaCrosse), and without changing my driving habits one bit, my gas mileage has increased from around 17 mpg to 21 mpg.  It is, for the most part, everything I'd hoped for in a car of Jaguar's class.                                                      
The only two things about it that drive me nuts are:                                                                                                                                                                                   
1) the infotainment system and screen are not befitting a car of this caliber.  Not at all intuitive, and clunky to operate while driving.  I can't do something as simple as change the radio station easily.  I have Sirius XM radio, and can't just turn a knob to change the channel.  I have to look at something.  That's ridiculous, and borderline dangerous.                                                                                                                                                                                                            
2) how does a car of Jaguar's caliber in 2017 not come with standard hands free telephony?  On me to have failed to ask the question, but I assumed that since my 2011 Buick LaCrosse had it, that this car would certainly have it.                                                                                                                                            
All this notwithstanding, I don't regret the purchase at all.  Love the car, and of course get lots of positive comments from people who see it.

jaguar,xf,2018,Jeff C., 10/29/2020,Good stuff!,4,"Purchased a used 2018 XF Sportbrake S with just 7,500 miles and under 11 months on the road. I was intrigued with the Jaguar wagon after reading reviews, and seeing a black one on the dealer's lot a couple years ago. The Sportbrake wagon is pretty unusual, as I've read that Jaguar only sold around 250 of them since they were introduced in 2016. 

I really like the styling, to my eye it's a very handsome car. Great lines and rather conservative exterior design are a welcome contrast from the Lexus RCF I traded in. Overall the aesthetic is one I admire, and I think it will age very well. The fact the Jaguar XFs are different from the other midsize cars in their class is a selling point. Unique and classy.

When I took the car home, I was initially excited and trying out all the features. The ""S"" model (the only trim available in the wagon) is loaded with options. I was playing with the ""soft close"" doors when the rear driver's side door malfunctioned and the door wouldn't close all the way. It would latch, but was slightly ajar. Naturally, this was troubling.

However, the next day I was able to take the car to the dealer and the kind service manager resolved the issue by simply holding the door handle open and closing and holding the door shut. The soft close motor then reset, and the problem was solved.

This initial incident activated my OCD, and my inner car critic started noticing small things that were concerning. The body fits were not quite the high standard I saw in my Lexus. Not horrible by any means, but a little wide and uneven in spots. Then there was a piece of rubber trim on the tailgate that wasn't tucked in all the way. Also, one of the rear seatbelts got hung up and wouldn't pull out. I did manage to get it functioning after some fiddling. Again, my OCD was on high alert. Overall, the interior is maybe a step down from my former car, with a few whiffs of cheapness. To be real about it, a car with an $80k-plus sticker price should be top notch in my opinion but I am willing to see this car as unique and different, and look for the areas where the Jag does shine.

Now on to the good stuff. The car is very quiet and the driver's area is very nice with great-smelling leather seats, and sporty steering wheel and substantial-feeling switches on the center of the wheel. Most of the surfaces are soft touch, and the look and feel is reserved and high quality, if slightly ergonomically quirky (the window switches are mounted far forward n the armrest, and sort of a reach). The tech is very good, fast to respond and most functions that are not supported with hard buttons are just a tap or two away. The Apple Carplay works great, however you must use the USB cord to access that functionality. The Bluetooth works great, pairing with my phone easily, and so far has not broken connection. The car does seem to revert to playing the radio after turning it off, not sure if that's an issue or just the way it's designed.

The car drives beautifully, and it handles great, with nice steering and fantastic body control over bumps and through turns. The supercharged V-6 is strong and smooth. The power is flexible and linear, and it has a nice deep exhaust note. The 8-speed transmission is better than the one in my old car, always seems to be in the right gear for the situation, and does not move to higher gears too quickly. It seems to always be in the right gear for the situation and operates imperceptibly in the background just like a good gearbox should. Good driving experience.

The suspension is the perfect blend of comfort and control, soaks up the bumps with one movement and holds the car level in the turns. I really like the serene ride and it makes me not miss the Lexus‚Äô firm, sporty ride too much. It has a more mature and refined ride quality.

As you can imagine, the car gets a fair amount of attention. Most people have not
 seen one of these cars in person. I must say that I love the style of the car, very classy and there‚Äôs not a bad line on this car. I took it to a Cars & Coffee event the other day, and had a lot of positive attention. One guy told me this was the best looking car at the event, even amongst the German and Italian cars that were there. I agree.

jaguar,xj,2009,Sirjoe, 10/30/2009,Fantastic power of black tiger,4,"Since I have had sedan cars, I've never touched something fantastic like this. XJ is the only one that can reach my desire. This black wild animal consists of powerful engine, conservative exterior design (I personally like) and unbelievable performance. In conclusion,XJ will never disappoint you. "
jaguar,xj,2011,fastrunner13, 04/03/2011,SuperSport: Just something extra,5,"As is custom built and I ordered my 2011 SJL SS in March 2010 and wait to end of August 2010 for delivery the wait was worth every moment.
I had driven the Supercharged 470hp with all the extra add ons that are standard on the Superport and just had to have the ultimate with 40Hp more.
Long wheel base is great, hadles like a sports car (almost) and goes like the new Ferrari 1/2 second slower in 1/mile at 112mph.
Eats up miles with on long trips of 12hrs without driver fatigue.


Maybe the best car ever and at a bargin price. In metalic silver looks like a block of machined aircraft aluminun.

Sound system is better than any I have heard from expensive stereo/theater systems. "
jaguar,xj,2011,GMilliken, 06/11/2016,Here kitty kitty.......,5,"This is my second Jag in 3 years.  I bought the XF, which I thought was the cats meow.  It was all good until I took it in for scheduled maintenance and I was given an XJ as a loaner.  Within 2 months I was driving the XJL.  I have had the car about 6 months now. I bought it used with only 11k miles and it has been a joy to drive and a real head turner.  This car is so fast that I have had to se the alarm when I am driving on the Freeway.  I broke down and bought a radar detector after I got stopped by the highway patrol over Memorial Day weekend.  I came over a hill saw him, looked at my speed which was 90 and just started to pull over.  By the time he caught up with me I was pulling onto the shoulder.  Unbelievably he did not give me a ticket.  Complimented the car and told me to watch the speed because of the holiday weekend.  I was shocked.  My insurance went  up when I bought the car and I was dreading what a ticket might do to it.  The car has never denied me the power I have requested.  You press the accelerator and it just keeps going, no lag or hesitation, just pure power.  Oh, and the sound of the engine, lovely.  When the sports mode is engaged it is a completely different driving experience.  Where the car is fast to start with the sport mode ads a bit more edge.  You have the option to use the paddle shifters when in sports mode, but the shifting is so smooth and in tuned with the car that I let it shift itself.  Only complaint is the touch screen interface for the Entertainment System.  It leaves a lot to be desired.  It is not responsive at all unless the heal of your hand accidentally touches the screen and then you usually loose whatever you were doing.  Work around is the voice recognition system. It works like a charm, so I use that when I need to set up Navigation or play with the sound system.  Back seat is unbelievable with the picnic tables and climate controls.  You can actually cross your legs in the back seat.  The fit and finish is second to none and the ride incredible.  It oozes luxury but in a kind of understated way.  Friend just got a new Benz, I have owned them in the past and the new ones seem kind of gimmicky to me.  The Benz logo pops open and a camera comes out when backing  up, when the door is open it shines the words Mercedes Benz on the ground.  Kind of tacky, I thought.  If you are looking for a car that stands out from the usual and has sports car power and awesome luxury this is your car.

jaguar,xj,2011,JZapata, 08/09/2017,Jaguar XJL 2011 BLOWS Engine at 56K miles! RUN!,1,"I must admit that this car is one of the sexiest and best looking vehicles I have ever owned.  Unfortunately the historical mechanical issues that for years plagued Jaguar have not disappeared.  I purchased this black beauty with just 10K miles in 2013 from a third party dealer that was selling it for his client.  The previous owner was the wife of a CEO and hardly ever drove it.  Here we are July of 2017 and at just 56K miles after driving it it from Miami beach to the Florida turnpike, a seven mile drive, the engine is now blown.  No warning lights, just went into protective mode and by the time we pulled over the damage was done.  Smoke everywhere and with the family in the car fortunately it did not catch fire as gas and oil leaked everywhere. Of course the car is out of warranty (ended Nov 2015) and after a very long process with Jaguar USA HQ executive escalations the best they could do is take 50% off the retail cost of the new engine.  I spent over $18,000 to put a new engine on a luxury Jaguar that had just 56K miles on it.  All service records were provided.  It was maintained at the dealer, oil changes which are synthetic done yearly or every 10K miles.  The only thing not done was the 5 year maintenance.  The entire experience dealing with Jaguar USA was terrible.  I felt like I was on trial with them trying to prove I was a negligent owner.  In the end they decided on a ""Goodwill"" benefit of 50% discount of the retail cost of the new engine plus parts needed that were damaged.  I still can not believe that Jaguar was unwilling to stand by their product and cover this issue.  Especially considering that while the car was under warranty in 2014 a similar problem occurred and they repaired and took care of it at 0 cost.  Those records were also provided though completely ignored.  Their conclusion was based on that I was the third owner of the car and that the 5 year maintenance was not done.  Completely unbelievable! In the end we all have to make our choices as consumers.  I own an F150 which has a 130K miles and no issues, had a Benz 150K miles and no issues, currently own a Porsche 30K miles no issues as for Jaguar I will NEVER purchase another no matter how sexy they are!  For those of you reading this post know that Jaguar USA is only interested in lining their pockets with 0 regards for their consumers especially if out of warranty.  My recommendation is don't walk, Run!!!!

jaguar,xj,2011,Richard Martin Jr, 11/23/2017,An electrical disaster,1,"Bought it new from Jim Coleman Jaguar in Columbia Md. Been plagued with electrical issues. Now the car goes into an complete electrical shutdown mode. It get frozen in ""Safe mode"" where you can only limp along. Both a local Jaguar repair shop and Jim Coleman Jaguar have recommended that I scrap the car even though it only has 53,000 miles, as they can not find the problem and can not guarantee they will ever find the problem regardless as to how much money I may spend. Per advise from Jim Coleman Jaguar, filed a complaint with Jaguar ""CRC"" (case 8000474963 if they happen to read) Three weeks later, no response from ""CRC"".  I may actually have to scrap what is otherwise a pristine car with a price tag of $100,000 at the 53,000 mile mark.

jaguar,xj,2011,ecurry, 12/23/2010,Just got mine last Monday,4,"I have owned 4 Mercedes Benz's and 2 Lexus'. I owned two S500's
( an 01 and an 02), an 03 SL 500 and a '10 E350 that we recently purchased earlier this year. I still have my '02 S500 and I love that car. I purchased all my vehicles new. 
Prior to this new change, I wouldn't even look at a Jaguar. There was nothing exciting about the vehicle at all. ( The same way I feel about Lexus now. Its a safe boring car.) 

I had actually gone to the dealership to look at the Panamera when the salesman told me I should look at the new XJ. He walked me over there and I was done!!! This is the sexiest car ever built. Go ahead and spend more money if you wish, you will NOT get more car!!!"
jaguar,xj,2011,ljosephus, 05/23/2011,Big Cat,3,"We only have 3,000 miles on our SJL but, so far, we are really pleased.
Performance is fine.
Rear seat legroom is exceptional.
With the exception of what appear to be overly wide gaps at fenders, hood, trunk lid, etc. the build quality seems excellent.
Just a few minor niggles:
The rear cup holders are positioned in a way that makes them virtually unusable.
The wood grain on the front doors does not match that across the dash (under the windshield), there is no dead pedal and the electronic responses (start-stop button, for example) is way too slow.
Ride is a little harsh.
Standard radio is great!
Both the transmission and engine are A-OK!
And the value, overall,
is outstanding."
jaguar,xj,2011,D.Sham, 01/17/2018,Luxury Rocketship!!,5,"This car is so fast its a bit untamed...which I like!! It is so easy to spin the tires that you have to be extra cautious on wet pavement and turns! The seats are quite nice, more form fitting than I expected. I've received so many compliments on the car! The gas mileage is surprisingly good too if you're on flat land. I can average 23-29mpg at 70mph. The downside is the rear seats are surprisingly cramped for such a long car. Also the ergonomics of where you place your elbows and knees is alittle uncomfortable, the electronics can go wonky at times, and the button and feature placement on the infotainment and center console takes some learning. Overall though, I bought this car used with 44K miles on it and its been a blast with no issues!

06 Range Rover Sport with a new supercharged one when my wife stumbled across the Jag XJ.
we both loved the look and decided to test drive it.
Once I sat in it I was mesmerized, once I drove it I was Sold.
had it for a week.
I would have never considered the a Jag before ( old people car).
but this new car puts the S550, 750Li, Audi A8 to shame with looks and performance.
Car&Driver tested it at 4.4 sec 0-60 and lists its competitors as S63, Maserati Quatroporte, Porsche Panamera Turbo, all of which cost 40k more than the Jag.
love the stares and compliments.
very poorly advertised. out since 2010, did not know it existed. the Jag for the young."
jaguar,xj,2011,Kirkari, 09/06/2010,WOW,4,"I had a BMW 650 and wanted to get a larger car as my kids did not fit in the back any longer.  So the natural choice was the 750Li.  As I was negotiating with my dealer, I noticed with my preferred options, the pricing put the car over $102K.  I stopped and thought I should shop around for other comparable cars such as the S550 and the Panamera S.  Luckily the Jag XJL Supercharge caught my attention on edmunds.com.  After test driving the Jag, I thought to myself,  OMG, what a beast!  I instantly fell in love with the workmanship and the power.  First thing I thought, I¬ím going to be faster than the other 3 cars and save over $10K on the pricing. Goodbye BMW!"
jaguar,xj,2011,ALPHA JAG XJL, 10/25/2010,The Cat is on the prowl,4,"The car is amazing. Interior is well crafted. Drove on the highway for 8 hours this week-end. No fatigue, body aches, etc. Excellent ride. Gas mileage on the highway is outstanding. One word to describe the engine, POWERFUL."

jaguar,xj,2011,MJL, 03/09/2019,"Actual, original, long-term owner",5,"The reviews that suggest problems are inconsistent with my own personal experience.  My 2011 replaced a 2008 BMW 750Li, and I currently own the Jaguar and a Mercedes GLS.  Hands down the Jaguar has provided the most rewarding ownership experience.  Out-of-pocket expenses other than annual scheduled maintenance, a new set of tires and a replacement battery is approximately $350.00 for a locking motor.  That's 8 1/2 years and 102,000 miles.  Apart from its having a bit more road noise than the 2008 BMW and an infuriatingly large and heavy keyless entry/ignition fob (both resolved in later versions), this car has delivered more satisfaction than any other I have ever owned.  I have been waiting for its replacement, only to find it's not going to be replaced as a gasoline powered vehicle.  Because of that and only because of that I have ordered a 2020 BMW 750.  The MPG rating below is based on my driving pattern, which is 70% highway driving.

I've always wanted a ""Jag"" since seeing them as a kid but expense plus reliability always gave me pause. As soon as I saw the new XJ I got goosebumps - loved the lines and modern styling.  Interior makes the German cars look pathetic.  Although I wouldn't have imagined getting a full size sedan, I got an Ultimate Black Supercharged SWB.  The figured ebony trim is gorgeous. So comfortable.  Feels very light - super smooth acceleration.  Love it!  My dealer (Rusnak in Pasadena) has exhibited personal attention to detail, the German dealers never showed.  You will love the stares.  Several folks have stopped me to compliment the beauty of the car."

The car is fully loaded and comes with ventilated seats front and rear and massaging seats. The engine is a monster supercharged 5.0L V-8 that makes 470 hp. The instrument cluster is digital and looks like a laptop screen. It is very well lit and is made to resemble real gauges but you can bring up navigation and radio on the screen. The exterior also has no radio sharkfin which contributes to its sexy roofline. Buy it and you won't be disappointed. "

Yesterday, I got in the car and the audio system was only putting out sound on the passenger side. Hoped it was a fluke, but no, same problem this AM. And these aren't the only issues- Edmunds only gives me so much space I cannot deny that this car is compelling to drive. On the days that everything works, it is a true pleasure. The build quality and reliability are abysmal though."
jaguar,xj,2011,1970L78, 07/20/2010,Rock Star,5,"I must say Jaguar was not on my list of cars to consider. On the insistence of a friend, I begrudgingly agreed to take a quick look. My God is this the purist, most advanced car on the market today! I bought one the next day as I just wanted to review my thoughts. This car is the grandest and liveliest full size sedan the world has yet seen. I drove the Panamera and was almost angry when done. The 750 LI was a heavy driving complicated mess of a design gone wrong (and this car was 1st on my 'list'). I tried so hard to like it. I did not. The Jaguar was breathtaking in both form and function. Everywhere I go, it turns heads. A saw a lady walk into a light pole the other day ogling the car."
jaguar,xj,2011,Dreski, 08/28/2010,Watch out for that Cat!,4,"The new design is an eye catcher for sure. If you're a luxury car driver, the SuperCharged will definitely place you in a status of your own. I love the drive feel, when all you have to do is slightly place your foot on the accelerator and watch out, you may be getting pulled over b4 you know it. It's a shame how other luxury manufacturers either charge you as options for what is standard in the SuperCharged. Plus you have more interior options to choose from then say, MB S550."
jaguar,xj,2011,Rich58, 09/30/2010,Closest Yet,4,"The 2011 XJ rightfully takes its place as the finest car in the class. Without question, the XJ oozes elegance and sophistication with a warmth and personality not found in its Teutonic rivals. This is the first true 21st century luxury car. Prrr."
jaguar,xj,2011,FormerBmwfan, 09/29/2010,Love this car,4,"I just wanted to echo the sentiments of all the other reviews I have read about this car, it's simply the most incredible machine on the road. I have owned flagship German cars and I promise you, if you drive this car you will be hard pressed to purchase an S class, 7 series, or an A8. The supercharged version is brutally quick. The interior of this car shames all of its German competitors. I have always been a fan of Jaguar but for reliability reasons was never comfortable enough to buy one, until now. This car is a game changer for Jaguar."
jaguar,xj,2011,Andy, 10/15/2010,Had to have it!,5,"We had been looking to replace my wife's 2005 Infiniti Q-45 which was coming off lease.  We looked at the MB S-550 and the BMW 7 series. Because of the pricing of both, I really thought we would wind up with a used 550 or 7 series.  That was until I saw the Jag XJL.  For basically the same price as a 1-2 yr. old MB or 7 series, we wound up with a fabulous car that looks great, performs unbelievably and is way ahead in all aspects when compared to the competitors."
jaguar,xj,2011,attorney88, 04/18/2011,The big cat of modern motoring,4,"I have a propensity of hating big cars. Therefore, with some reservation, I leased a XJ super charge last week after the lease expiration of XF Supercharge. (This is my forth Jaguar vehicle).
The car is a wonder, it dissipates my dislike for big cars as it actually feels agile and precise in handling (you don¬ít feel the car is big when driving).
The power is beyond any description and more than adequate at all levels. My car is in ultimate black with London tan as interior. Just a week, the car has totally won my admiration as well as a lot of compliments from pedestrians at stoplights and strangers at car washing place.

jaguar,xj,2011,Brandon Mattingly, 01/02/2019,Beautiful Combination,5,"Imagine 5.0 L horse power meets practicality with seating for 5 comfortably. The good is stylish, fun and engaging drive. Not raw Dodge Viper power but certainly enough to know you are riding in a v8. The ride is not quite Bentley smooth, but very intuitive to the driving experience. It does not beat you up but you will also not get bored driving the car. I hate the delay on the entertainment system ie. Nav, radio ect. It is nothing major but there is a delay when you press the screen. My favorite part about this car is how quickly the depreciation rate is. It would be awful for someone who buys the car new, but if you will buy one just a couple of years old you will save a boat load of money on a remarkable automobile. They are not common in my area either which is awesome for all of the looks you get driving the thing. Everybody wants to talk about this car.

The first time I saw this new Jag was while passing it on an interstate, and I had the immediate reaction of missing the old XJ look. Then I started looking at photos and reading about it. My old XJL has over 212,000 miles on it so started driving & comparing several new luxury sedans. I saved the Jag for last. The beauty & performance of the car were stunning! After a week of testing the speed & cornering limits (mine, not the cars'), I've settled down to enjoying its stately side around town, like a grandmother should. I love the car!   "
jaguar,xj,2011,JeffI30, 05/21/2010,Where did the grace and style go?,2,"First let me say the only reason I bought this Jag was because of a particular business situation. Where has all the grace, style and beauty of the XJ series gone? Having a Jag always lent you a certain panache.  Now with the new design, well to be blunt, I might as well have gotten a Chrysler. Well the back end of the Chrysler 300, with the front end of the Volvo S80. The XJ was an icon, not anymore. It looks like every other car on the road. Even the ""leaping jaguar"" is gone. What are they thinking?  Are they aware of what's known as destroying a brand.  Having a Jaguar meant you had reached a certain status in life, I guess they decided to become a any car brand. "
jaguar,xj,2011,Ralph Alcantar Jr, 06/28/2010,This car turns head for sure!,4,The new design caused me to trade in my LS460/Lexus and change my mind on the purchase of a S500/Mercedes after one test drive.

Beautiful interior and amenities. Fast. Handled well. Styling is a head turner and fantastic on the highway - especially at 80+mph. Then, ye olde Jaguar myths of olde started to manifest - even after the complete TaTa retool. First to go was the automated moonroof cover. Came off the tracks - $800 to repair. Next the radio, nav, and AC control unit went out - $2400. Alternator failure stranded us in the middle of Texas - $900. Oil pan started to leak - $800. And finally, when the front main seal started leaking(all before 40k miles - it was time to go back to a BMW. I did buy a 1991 XJS v-12 convertible as well and - while not without its idiosyncrasies - has provided a lot of enjoyment and you can still work on them yourself. Overall, if you have a lot of money and a daily driver -  a Jag can be a wonderful second car to own."

I recently took this car on a road trip, around 2000 miles round trip.  On the return trip home I decided not to spend a night in a hotel and just stop for gas and food, I don't know what you've read or heard about this car but trust me.  This is a bad ass car.  I was thoroughly impressed.  During the trip I drove on many types of road surfaces and sometimes bad weather conditions and nothing fazed this car.  There was nothing it couldn't handle and all systems worked perfectly.  Nothing broke down.  I""m 48 years old, 300 lbs and I hadn't been on a long road trip in about 25 years.  Didn't know if I was going to enjoy it as much as I did in my younger years.  I really enjoyed  the trip.  Mainly because of the XJ.  Believe me many a time I was in some desolate country,  there wasn't a town for maybe 40 or 50 miles and this car took me through that without breaking a sweat.  Sometimes I did 110 mph and put it on cruise control.  I'm a car person so I'm getting a little teary eyed talking about this.  No I don't work for Jaguar.  I'm here to help those who are maybe thinking about buying this car.  I've had it for almost 4 years and nothing has broke on it.  Seriously, ....nothing.  Performance is excellent.

I had the problem intermittently and I took it in while still under warranty, but they couldn't figure it out.

When it comes to the essentials of a SPORTY LUXURY CAR, the XJ JAGUAR!    Powerful, quick, comfortable ECONOMICAL.   I GET 35 Miles per gallon on highway and about 25 to 30 around town.   If you want to accelerate quickly you‚Äôve got it.   People comment all the time about this beautiful it is.   I‚Äôve owned LS Lexus, Mercedes S class, bmw.   In certain features each is superior.

jaguar,xj,2013,Bill A, 05/30/2017,"Jaguar XJL portfolio, awesome car",5,"After you buy one you will not want to drive anything but a Jaguar. I have owned many fine cars but the Jag is so comfortable, quiet, plush, and powerful, it makes my Lincolns, and Mercedes pale by comparison, and the Jag costs less than the my Benz. Since purchase in 2013, nothing has broken. For required service the dealer picks up my car and leaves me a new Jag to use and delivers my car back to me. On trips the Jag delivers 30 mpg ! Where ever I go people look at it and comment how good it looks. Back seat passengers are in awe of the space. I am about to buy another one.   I dislike only one thing, the engine shuts off at stop lights etc and restarts when you take your foot off the brake, very stupid idea, thank goodness there is an ""eco"" button to disable it.  I LIKED THIS CAR SO MUCH I TRADED IT FOR A NEW ONE. THE NEW ONE HAS A FEW MORE FEATURES AND IS OF THE SAME SUPERB QUALITY, TROUBLE FREE FOR THE LAST 4 THOUSAND MILES. BUT I STILL HATE THE AUTOMATIC SHUTOFF, RE START IDIOTIC IDEA, THANK GOODNESS IT CAN BE SHUT OFF WITH THE ""ECO"" BUTTON. AWESOME CAR! As of 5/30/19, the 2016 car has 20,000 miles on it, not one problem, what a great car to drive, I still hate the auto shut off when I stop, if I forget to hit the""eco"" button off. This car is head and shoulders nicer than my 550 Benz was, and so much more reliable.

jaguar,xj,2013,carlspackler1, 12/14/2014,Best value for $$$,5,"UPDATE: This is still my favorite of all the cars I've owned. It is rock solid and quiet at cruise speeds, corners superbly, and is very reliable. Inept dealer service has been the only  drawback - having to return to the dealer 4 times to reset the service indicator warning.

Simply the best car I've owned. After many Mercedes, I grew tired of their mundane interiors, and lately their  Rube Goldberg exterior styling.
The interior is measureably more luxurious and inviting than any Mercedes we've owned. The doors close with a solid ""thunk""' reflecting the quality. Instrumentation is straightforward, and the audio quality is far beyond anything we've heard from Mercedes.  
Despite the negative reviews of the audio/navigation system, we've found this system much more user friendly, and programs easier than Mercedes clunky system.

jaguar,xj,2013,Bob, 05/06/2019,A pleasure to see and drive,5,"My ""Italian Racing Red"" auto has been flawless the past 3 yrs with only normal maintenance required.  I purchased in Feb 2015 with 15,000 miles on odometer.  I have taken meticulous care of this car.  If I see or hear any issue, I schedule an appt with my Jaguar dealer.  My first year of ownership saw issues with the steering, water pump, electrical and a few other items.  All covered under warranty.  After all the bugs were shaken out during my first year, I have total confidence that the car is in excellent shape and I am very happy with my purchase.  I drove from LI, NY out to Arizona (spent a few months there) and drove back without any issue.  Real world MPG going to AZ was 30.5mpg.  I now have 48,200 miles on the car and it is out of the ""Jaguar Certified"" period.  In my opinion, you always want a Jaguar dealer to work on the XJ.  It was explained that a special set of tools is required for the XJ and that other Jaguar model tools will not work with the XJ.  Oil changes, tires and parts are expensive, however the service interval is every 10,000 miles.  You are riding in a car that is head turning, comfortable and a pleasure to drive.  Update Dec 2019: I have 53,400 miles at this point and out of CPO warranty.  The only none-maintenance type item; had my check engine light; needed a oxygen sensor installed by Jag dealer ($700).  Still very happy.  Update June 2020: Only replaced rear tires (first time) and the auto is running great without any issue(s)!

Found the Mercedes interior disappointing. Sitting in both Lexus models was like sitting inside a computer: soulless and cold. No personality or warmth at all. Sitting in my AWD XJ is like being in a leather chair in an English gentleman's club. Plenty of power, excellent handling. Design and build quality both superb. A bigger car than I actually wanted, but, when we sat in it, my wife and I just looked at each other and knew we'd found our car."

On Wed 13th November 2013 I was driving on a dual carriageway at
60mph when the car suddenly accelerated. I thought the cruise control was on and braked to cancel it, but the car just kept going faster. I tried switching to manual and forcing it into lowest gear with no effect, pumping
brake and engaging the hand brake , but the car just kept going faster and I was rapidly approaching other vehicles. So I moved into the fast lane, which was clear, but then two cars pulled out in front of me to overtake a lorry. At 90mph I hit themand am lucky to be alive"
jaguar,xj,2014,cbrandi, 03/27/2015,"My third Jaguar, but my first XJ",5,"I cross shopped all the major cars in the class, wanted a luxurious car with a definite performance edge.  Decided Maserati Ghibli was too much an unknown and its interior wasn't up to snuff.  The S Class was superb but too large and too expensive.  The BMW 7 series needs updating, it looks and felt like a bloated 3 Series.  Audi's are boring.  I've been very happy with my decision.  Its fast, but very comfortable on long road trips.  Although large, it drives small.  Quality is outstanding and attention to detail, make it one of the best interiors for any amount of money.  Gas milage has been amazingly good for such a large car.  This is where the all aluminum construction pays off.

Update:  Traded this car for a sports SUV.  Needed more cargo carrying capacity.  Having some regrets.  The XJ was perhaps the most luxurious and prestigious car I've owned.  Inside you felt special with that Jaguar interior.  It was quiet and fast on the road, reliable and returned 32mpg on the highway while cruising at 80mph. I didn't buy another Jaguar because I don't like the interior of the F-Pace when compared to other premium SUVs, it felt un-Jaguar.

jaguar,xj,2014,R. Stedman, 11/05/2018,PROPS FOR THE 2014 XJR,5,"I've owned approximately 175 cars, including a few prior Jaguars.  I've always loved their styling, but previous models always required too much maintenace.  My 2014 XJR is well sorted. After 32000 miles, just tires, oil, and one door moulding.  The car is exceptionally comfortable for a tall, big man.  Handling is great for a car this size.  There is a very slight vibration felt through the steering wheel even after alignment, new tires and wheel balancing, but it very slight.  Build quality and materials are superior.  Love the car.  I'm obviously a frequent trader, but I'm having trouble finding reasons not to keep the Jag.  This may be my favorite car of all time.  Relatively uncommon, stylish, smooth, and when you put your foot in it, it's off to the races.  Navigation is fine, but I use Google maps most often, which is more up to date.

I had a 2005, all black, interior and exterior, tinted window XJ8L.  I owned ""her, 'Betsy' "" for 10.5 years, 117,300 miles (purchased at 23,000+ miles, coming off of a 2 year lease at purchase). Until the day my wife ""totaled her"" while ""Betsy"" was parked (11/2017), I received compliments on that car EVERY WEEK! State Farm insurance gave me a very nice close out, totaled figure, for the car. I picked up this 2014 XJL AWD Portfolio, Rhodium Silver, at 21,826 miles, with all the bells and whistles of the AWD ""Portfolio,"" panoramic roof and all to replace ""Betsy.""  Yet the class and distinction of my 2005 is missing (let alone the ""Leaper"" hood ornament.) I didn't want the newly styled Jaguar XJ from the ""git go."" But at the end of the day, other vehicles which I could afford, lacked the distinction of the Jaguar XJ. No real complaints except the distinction and seeming classy appearance of the earlier model XJs is missing. In addition, it also seems the mileage is not as good.

However the infotainment system is years behind Merecedes, Audi, and BMW. I had an Audi A8L prior to this and this is a step backwards as far as the electronics. The worst part is that The Bluetooth and hands free system have never worked properly since day 1 and are completely unreliable and dealer had not been able to get it resolved. Also my ability to get it to play my music from my phone is equally unreliable. Just way too many electronic glitches with this car. Getting assistance from Jaguar and the dealer has also been a big hassle. I am going to take a hit and get ride of this car in the next few months, tired of the glitches and their inability to get it resolved. As a whole I have been very disappointed with my experience and the quality of the car and Jaguar‚Äôs service. I would not recommend getting this car unless you have lots of patience.

jaguar,xj,2016,RKW, 07/26/2016,Complicated!,4,"I have had this car for about a month. It looks great and it gets compliments from total strangers. It is fun to drive if you are just driving on a highway. Good value for the price I am paying. However the car is quite long and I have trouble parking it. The park assist is helpful but can not be relied on totally. The car has quite a few glitches, I believe in its computer.  It takes about a minute for the computer to boot up, almost like a PC and not like my Mac Book Air, for comparison. The Park assist is difficult understand. Is it on all the time or does it require manual turn on? However the main issue we have is with the AC. It does not cool as well as the Lexus SUV we are used to. Also the AC sensors may be at times having difficulty figuring out what to do. Even when we turn the temp dial up to 80 to stop the high speed of the fan (in AUTO mode )it keeps going.  The navigation etc and other tech features will take some time to get used to, unless you are familiar with jaguar.  I am probably half way through, that too with the essentials.  Over all it has been a good experience and my brother who drove it a thousand miles to bring it to us enjoyed the drive and did not feel tired, even from the long trip. I may ahve to take it back to my summer home since parking space in the winter place is a tight fit, needing quite a bit of careful maneuvering. Since I do not have to be in a hurry any more that is ok!

Clock resets to military time for no reason, choosing a particular playlist delivers another, sensors randomly turn off, super disappointing. The Meridian Sound can't be beat but the reliability of the infotainment system is horrible and so frustrating that it wrecks the rest of the experience of owning the car. In shop constantly for firmware upgrades which only fix the problems for a week or two. (If I lived next door to dealer I would have the memory flashed weekly). $80,000 is too much to to pay to put up with the daily frustration of driving this car.

jaguar,xj,2017,Flyman, 03/08/2019,Superb. Good enough for the Queen,5,"The XJL is a big car, with a relatively small trunk - meaning that the space is use by the interior. The rear seats (heated, and cooled as standard, with massage and electronic recline options) are a lovely place to spend a lot of time, and feel opulent and spacious. There are no clamors for 'shotgun' with this car as the rear is just as comfortable as the front. The driver's seat is also a fine place to be - heated, cooled, massage, infinitely adjustable - I can sit there for an 8 hour drive and get out feeling cool, calm and collected. I have the 470HP V8. It is smooth as silk, goes like a rocket, and roars like a Jaguar.  I have driven the V6 and find it adequate. Its also coarse to the V8 refined (but some people do prefer the rasp to the roar). I have found with my driving style there is little between the fuel economy as the V6 has to work harder in acceleration, the V8 returns 30mpg on the highway at 70-75 mph because it doesn't have to do anything other than tick over.  And if you are spending $100k on a new car do you care about a few bucks a month on fuel?Its way more distinctive, graceful, and good to drive and look at than the BMW 7 or Mercedes S. I'm not familiar with the Audi A8, but for me the only competitor in this segment is the Maserati Quatraport. The Jaguar of old had reliability problems - mine has never been in the shop except for service and note that some years have 5 years free maintenance and 5 years of bumper to bumper warranty which is transferable, making this a ridiculously good value as 2 or 3 year old used car. The navigation, voice recognition and some of the othe technology feels clunky and can be irritating - why make a fabulous car and then tie it up to AT&T for connectivity? (for those who don't know, AT&T has one of the lowest customer satisfaction levels of any US company). The car is excellent and I can't score it less than 5 stars just because it has a complicated navigation system and obsolete 3G AT&T WiFi hotspot! The ride can be transformed to be EVEN SMOOTHER with 18 inch wheels by the way.

jaguar,xj,2018,Robert Bruce, 10/01/2018,"Bentley luxury, Jaguar price",5,"Most impressive is the London Tan Interior, the finest interior I've ever owned.  Its their top option and worth it.  Suede headliner matters a lot to me, and Jag has it.  Powerplant is robust and quick, but rides like true luxury car.  This is bang for the buck.  We looked at everything.  There are great cars out there, some maybe better or not as good looking at all the things there are to review; overall, this one is home run.  Worth a test drive before your next purchase, which is what we did over several weekends.  Have one at the house, and a 2014 used model with all the options at the coast house.  That 2014 was a real bargain.  If you're shopping to save money, definitely check out the low mileage inventory two or three model years old.  Not too many differences, but as you know, from showroom new to a couple of years old one takes a hit.  So you could buy and get the same quality just a couple of model years old and save a bunch.  Recommend the sports options and interior max'd out.  It is a Bentley quality interior, the factory intends it that way, and I'm glad to see the new money behind Jag taking the high road.  There just aren't that many luxury sedans left to choose from, but this XJL really does the job for us.

Edmund's review is an accurate assessment. We like the lite steering feel, the brake pedal feels fine to me, the ZF 8 speed auto transmission is smooth as silk and does it's job seamlessly as does the supercharged 3.0 V6 engine. The V6 is extreamily satisfactory for this lux car. (I have a 2014 Corvette for comparison.)  Our XJ has AWD. I have a car lift in my garage so I checked out the underside of the car after removing the under engine plastic cover and the car is extreamily well built. (I'm a retired mechanical engineer and was a auto tech way back in the 1950s, I'm 81 yrs young) The paint, body fit & finish as well as the enterior are all excellent! The handling on our Seirra Nevada  foothill mountain roads is excellent! With Firenze red paint & 20"" split-spoke wheels, the car gets a lot of notice. We traded in a 2004 XJ8 that we owned for nearly 12 years. It was our first Jaguar and was an excellent car. My wife and I have had 49 cars in our 63 years of marital bliss so, we are pretty good judges of what makes a good car. Check back with me about 50,000 miles from now. I expect to report that this 2019 XJ is as good as the '04 was.

Also the fail safe engine mode light comes on once a month, it seems like and it's always a $400-500 repair.

jaguar,s-type,2000,Nookpad, 12/02/2015,Incredible,5,"I don't understand why people dislike these cars so much. I believe it boils down to the attitude of the owner. A 2000 Honda Civic driver says they have the most reliable car ever and they love it ( 2 of the windows don't roll down, interior is falling apart but it still starts stops and gets them places so therefore it's great.) Meanwhile you ask a 2000 jag owner and a window stops rolling down and its the worst car they've ever owned. 
THE CAR IS 15 YEARS OLD ITS GOING TO HAVE A FEW ISSUES! 
So far the only thing I've had to do to my S-Type is replace a window regulator ($30) and replace the MAF sensor ($30) both of which I did myself. It is RWD so it absolutely sucks in the snow but I got sedan chains that make it drive great during the winter. I feel that jag owners want to scare people off with expensive repair bills just because they believe they are too good for everyone else to drive one. 
Obviously if you don't care about the quality and enjoyment of owning a nice car by all means go for the Honda Civic. It will be easier for you to fix yourself if something happens and it is more fuel efficient. However, if you enjoy a fast fun luxury car the Jaguar s-type is amazing!

Be careful, if it looks like Gremlins lived in it, you can bet maintenance wasn't performed! Shop around! Even though my car is 16 years old, people ask me if she's new!  I would not have considered buying had I not known this model was built under the ownership of Ford... [my previous cars were Lincoln Mark 8, 96 T-bird, 90 T-bird, and a 78 Mustang II, so I'm sort of partial to Fords!] My husband says it should be no more difficult to repair, if the time comes, than my Lincoln which i drove for 14 years...It is a perfect car for my job as a Realtor, gives me instant cred!  She is a real head turner, and  stands out as special in a sea of Mercedes and BMWs. I have had no issues since I bought her, and I always smile when I get in! It has the V8 power I love, and a smooth ride my clients love! I do wish it had more of today's technology, and plan to upgrade that as Nav and bluetooth phone are really a necessity in my profession.
2 years since I wrote this review and she has only needed minor maintenance.  New Oxygen Sensors. As far as O2 sensors go they were inexpensive ($275 w/ installation) .  I also replaced a battery. I feel these items are merely maintenance. Other than that she has been reliable as hell, quick as a bunny, and a knockout in the looks Dept.

jaguar,s-type,2000,jaketthomas, 05/11/2011,"Looks amazing, quality is the worst of all-time",2,"I always loved the looks of Jaguars.
I always wanted one. I bought a 2000 S-Type with 48k miles on it. Thought, I can't go wrong! From day 1, every, oh, I'd say 30-45 days, the check engine light comes on. Yes, needs a repair, whether it be minor or major about once a month, on average. Ignition Coils, 4 catalytic converters, oxygen sensor, the Heat completely stopped working twice, Gearbox went, had a bizarre problem with my rear brakes, CD changer shorted out, cigarette lighter blows fuses once a month, rear windows don't go down, one back door doesn't shut all the way... I could literally go on and on.
This car is the biggest piece of crap imaginable. "

This car, though gorgeous, is a mechanical nightmare. I bought mine used, it's almost paid off, and I will get rid of it asap. If you ever by an s- type 3.0, you'd better have a great warranty to fix the common issues seen on almost all s types eventually: (coils fail, o2 sensors fail, coolant seals fail, headlights fail, headliner falls, oil leaks, transmission problems, weak brakes, plastic parts eventually fail, rear window tracks fail.) if you do your research (like I should have) you'll see negative comments all over the web about this model car. Buy it if you can afford many repairs! "

The Jag (knock on wood...and there is plenty to knock on) has been reliable with only one issue (radio went out).   "
jaguar,s-type,2000,jimjr11, 08/20/2011,Worst car I ever owned!!!,2,"I bought my 2000 S-Type 4.0 new and have spent a fortune on it and had many days in the shop while still
warranted as well.
Don't believer I ever got out fr less than $800. I can count on one
hand how many people have ever sat in the back seat, that window never is used, yet I'm on my fourth window raising device.

The car leaks and three trips to the shop they can't find the source carpet

If the car stalls right after starting, it will never start again, have had it towed four times.

Ball joints gone at 70k, trunk has leaked since it was new. the gas release has stopped three times, the mirrors don't adjust and there's a rattle in the center of the dash they can't find a solution for."
jaguar,s-type,2000,Sam, 07/28/2006,WORST vehicle for QUALITY.,2,Expensive repair required every 90 days. Every thing is repaired from trans/engine to things you can not expect. It is always a surprise.  But best part is you will replace lot of window regulators. Recommend to STOP using window.  
jaguar,s-type,2000,nkarr, 09/19/2008,Run far from this car - don't do it,3,"Worst purchase of my life. 55k when purchased and 6 months later I have less than 60k and have had the car in the shop more than 5 times. Replaced evaporator, condenser, 2 coils with the need to still replace the others. Both back windows quit working. One of them falls down. Idles rough probably because of the coils. Trans doesn't shift correctly. Interior compartment door latch broke. Entire dash taken out to repair freon leak. Total cost has been over 2k in repairs without fixing some of the outstanding problems. Every time I see a car like this I say ""but isn't it pretty"". In other words if you want a car that looks great but runs like crap then buy this car. If you value your money don't."
jaguar,s-type,2000,jagsRfun, 03/26/2002,Jaguar 2000 S Type 4.0,4,"Very fun to drive.  4.0 version is like a rocket.  Lots of power and great handling.  There is good road feel while still feeling like a luxury car.  

Back seat is a little small but usable.  Only one small annoyance which is that the glove box vibrates when very cold.  

The head-turning factor is also great.  People assume the car costs much more than it does.  Overall, I would buy it again."

It's an absolutely beautiful car and I still get compliments from strangers.  IF they only knew what sort of NIGHTMARE this car is mechanically.  From cheap front headlights, to constant leaks, continued engine trouble, poor brakes and constant repair bills.  I'm looking to dump this car as soon as it makes sense monetarily.  DO NOT buy a 2000 Jag S Type from any dealer. At first, you'll love you car ... but eventually you'll regret the day you drove it off the lot.        "
jaguar,s-type,2000,Hulloimadam, 10/11/2009,Terrible Car,2,We bought this car a while ago for around 56K... We sold it for 12k. The worst car every owned by far.

transmission will not come out of park 
on ""any"" slope. This is not fixable 
according to Jaguar and is still being 
duplicated on the new ones. To us, this 
means, that it is not econimically 
fixable without listening to a lot of 
our grief, or some class action 
response.  Their ""answer"" is to always 
remember to put the emerg brake on 
first, then put in park, then turn off 
the engine. Their own service person 
didn't do this on our last oil change.

people, this is a ""Typical and common 
problem"". "
jaguar,s-type,2000,Robert Danaian, 08/04/2005,Terrible Reliability,1,This is the worst luxury (?) car I have ever had. Never know what is going to fail next. How can Jaguar get away with such an awful car? I have spent thousands repairing this car. Do yourself a favor and buy something else. Anything else.
jaguar,s-type,2000,Ernie Bello, 01/28/2006,From BMW M3 to Jag Type S?,4,"Went from a 97 BMW M3 which was a wonderfully reliable, striking, and fun to drive vehicle because my wife was tired of shifting in heavy traffic, etc. Bought the jag from one of my customers- it has been a wonderful vehicle! No headaches, suffering, or disasters! Had a couple of small problems, quickly and easily solved. Thje car is certainly more sedate and refined than the M3, while the M3 is certainly the sportier of the two. The Jaguar has more options, more toys, etc. While the M3 is the better ""race car"" the Jaguar is certainly the choice for long, fast & relaxed cruising; the V8 engine has ample power for spirited driving in traffic. Good mileage, too: 27mpg highway."
jaguar,s-type,2000,Gerry Jackson, 01/21/2007,2000 S-Type Jaguar 3.0,4,"This is my third used Jaguar since 2000. Each one was 6 years old when I purchased them. They have each been better as the years went on. Build quality in the 2000 is much better than my 1994 SJ6. It is a very comfortable car (my wife reminds me of this regularly) and has lots of bells and whistles. We enjoy the heated front seats this time of year (January) and the moon roof in the summer. The car is plenty fast enought for me and as long as I stay around 75 miles an hour, fuel economy is good. So far the car has cost me $0 in maintenance (dealer looks after all fluids for first 2 years).   They  replaced two burned out lower beam lights no charge. Lights are on all the time."
jaguar,s-type,2000,Paul Grzechowiak, 07/18/2017,Research for parts,2,"the valve cover gaskets start to leak every couple of years allowing oil to fill up spark plug compartment, and shorting out ignition coils. 0n V6 models you can not access coils, and spark plugs without taking off big intake pipes on cylinder numbers 1-2-3. You must be careful not to break small plastic line coming from top radiator hose going to overflow canister, when removing valve cover, or just inspecting hose's. Another big headache is finding bushings for upper, and lower control arm bushings for front, and rear. without bushings the car squeaks, and can cause vibration. Recommend you do not buy cheap front lower ball joints. The driver side power window system is always breaking. I have replaced 3 times, with more problems. If you do not search for parts you will pay way too much.

jaguar,s-type,2000,Dawn, 12/02/2005,Didn't see this one coming,2,"What can I say; buy the car on a Monday and have over $3,000 in repairs before the weekend.  The bleeding doesn't stop there.  Make the monthly payment and triple that for repairs. Has been that way for over a year now.  Been paying $9 per lug nut,  $1000 for a starter w/o installation,  just lose the key, or have the hood ornament taken.  The leather fades in color, the sun roof sticks, and the car only starts when it feels like it.  Doesn't drive well at all in any amount of snow.  It stays at home, it won't move!  My dream is my worst nightmare.  Anyone can afford to buy a Jag, but not many can afford to keep one.  The parts are dealer only, no aftermarket, and are about 400% more. Sad!"
jaguar,s-type,2000,Linda, 02/10/2010,Love my Jag!,4,"I bought my 2000 Jag S-Type in 2008 with only 30,000 original miles. It now has 57K but has had some AC/Heater problems fortunately covered by the extended warranty which cost close to 4,300 to repair. The sensor in the gas tank seems to cause the Check Engine light to come on and off when the tank is full or empty. So I live with that knowing that there is a sensitive problem with the CE light and gas tank. The car is a real eye catcher and the ride is so smooth. I love the way the car seems to hug you too. My only concern is that I have left my car and come back and found my windows down and sunroof open. My husband believes me now since it happened to him also. Weird. I still love my Jag!"
jaguar,s-type,2000,DeeMo, 03/29/2009,Love My Jag!,4,"Purchased brand new, and it was money well spent.  Invested in additional options e.g. interior wood package, chrome rims and body chrome.... and with the Jag being Black.... it remains a head turner. I have owned and continue to own many luxury cars, as well. Within the past two years, the only out of pocket expenses paid were for a cracked windshield fluid container, oil pan gasket, ignition coil set replacement, and the interior roof fabric had to be redone. My Jag has been reliable, and it is fun to drive. It is a definite keeper! And it is now 2009."

That's where the love affair ended.  This car (as are most S-Types) quickly became a mechanical nightmare (and I take care of my cars and am an easy driver).  With less than 12k miles on it, I had issues with the brakes, coolant leak, gasket leak, radiator leak, failed headlights, issues with front brakes, failed cig lighter, failed O2Sensor, failed catalyst...the list never stops.   Jag quality was bad, but Ford didn't help! "

quick and with the upgraded tires wet
weather handling is very firm. 

I was hit on the passenger side by a
Ford F350 duel wheel pick-up with very
little impact into the passenger

During my ownership, I've only had one issue.  A rear window belt snapped and had to be replaced.  Easily done at the dealership...and not too obnoxiously priced. So far, the quality is right on par with the Lexus...but with much better performance and more style."

faults.  Budget paid for the repairs 
totaling about $400. From reviews, I 
always use the brake pedal or the 
parking brake before moving from park 
to drive. So far, no problems, a 
delight to drive, seafoam color (a 
rare one). Mileage is poor, but with a 
car like this why complain.  When I

and tons of fun.  It has a terrific body

getting it out of park at times, and if
it sits on even the slightest incline,
it becomes very difficult to get out of

the quality and reliability 
(=maintenance expense) for this 
$50,000+ luxury car is bitterly 
disappointing.  Ownership costs for 
maintenance alone exceeds $2000 per 
year - from basic manufacturing 
defects. Ford does not stand behind 
this product. Consequently, I've 
purchased my last Ford product. "

It needed internal engine work @ 8K mi, 12K,  20K and 50Kmi.  When I got it home from the last engine overhaul ($1800) the radiator started leaking.  After that the transmission staarted downshifting on the freeway.  At 60,000 mi I had to dump it.  It was a VERY expensive mistake.  DO NOT BUY ONE."
jaguar,s-type,2000,David, 04/07/2007,Aging Badly,4,"We have absolutely loved this car, and up until now, marveled at how much Ford's ownership had improved the reliability of the marque (vis a vis Jaguar's reputation in the 1980s).  At five years of age, window channels and other relatively minor things broke that would never have failed in some other automobiles.  Most recently, with less than 40,000 miles on the odometer, we got to pay $2,400+ for a transmission rebuild.  It was explained that there is a ""braking mechanism"" in the transmission that helped slow the car when the foot was lifted aff of the accelerator.  Ford has improved Jaguar's reputation from their former deplorable reputation up to Ford's mediocre at best reliability.  "

the road and is quite comfortable on 
long trips.  Haven't experienced any 
major mechanical malfunctions, only 
gripe I have is that the car needs 
better quality parts on the smaller 
items.  For instance, the gas cover 
needs a metal latch versus the plastic 
one it has (broke once already).  The 
window mechanisms tend to breakdown 
quite often (3 times) causing the 
window to drop down into the door and 
in Yuma, AZ during the summer it's not 
a great experience with over 100 degree 
temps during the day.  The stereo amp 
was replaced due to a loud humming 
noise even when the stereo was turned 
off."
jaguar,s-type,2000,Al Ryan, 07/21/2019,The dream car of my late wife.,5,"Only item is the lack of an odometer - dealer says it's lights that have burned out.  Must disassemble the entire dashboard to get at the lights.  My concern is that the car will not come back to me factory-new.  I can live w/o an odometer.  Given the age of the car (2000), the State of Florida doesn't care about what the mileage is.  Mileage about 100K.  Bought the car in a private sale in 2003 with 9K on the odometer.  Car is a 9 inside and out.  Second owner.  Always garaged and is garaged today.  I don't drive it because I drive an F-250 pick-up.

jaguar,s-type,2000,Jimmy, 06/10/2020,Impossible to fix - 2000 Jaguar S Type,2,"Was an electrical nightmare. Jaguar hasn't updated the modular computer codes and won't.
Window regulators break often. Was impossible to fix exhaust sensor read outs. I finally had to give up on it as the rear sub-frame is made of cast iron. It rotted out and one more pothole would have sent the rear end to the pavement. It was fun to drive, comfortable, and beautiful to look at. But way not worth the constant repairs. Spend $5,000.00 more on a different model and within a year it will be cheaper to own than an S Type.

jaguar,s-type,2001,Adam, 07/27/2005,I love this CAT,4,"I recently traded in my 2000 S-Type 4.0 to get an '01 3.0. Boy am I happy I did. The '00 leaked and had many little things break (the drawer in the dash, window regulator). The '01 feels for solid and is much more quiet.  It's smooth and so good looking as well as 7 mpg better on gas. I miss the power and the growl from the V8, but I feel much better in this one. The only thing I have a problem with is it's inability to not fish tail when taking turns in the rain, no matter the speed I am going. Here in Florida, the roads get slick. I have never had this problem with a Lexus, that's why I am a little shocked. I LOVE this car, I love the style, I love everything. And it's cheap to buy used."

Going on 46,000 miles this car remains in my personal showroom. But when it's pulled out on weekends you better believe it delivers. I just can't get rid of it! Always sporty and a pleasure to drive, not quite a thrill as my E500 or Lexus GS 430 but still is a number one contender in the luxury midsize division.

transmission, dash board and glovebox 
replacements, trunk leaks and other 
issues. With only 41,000 miles during

to Jaguar were met with representatives

It's a good idea to get the extended warranty after end. Acceleration is not on par with MB, but handling is superb. The styling is more appealing than most. Interior quality is excellent, and even better with the 03 Revised models. The 19/24 fuel economy is just average. The car definately is a head turner, but it is quickly silenced with electrical headaches. I do suggest this car as long as it is an 03 or newer model. I plan to try trade it in for jaguars new XK. Overall, this car has met my demands and I can reccomend it."

Quiet, smooth ride even at high speeds.  Only a minority of parts are difficult to get. I have found it easy to work on. Use the right tools. I have had to replace spark plug wires, air sensor, rotors and pads. This vehicle set in a garage for @4 years (owner had health issues) with no driving only being started occasionally. If buying an s type be sure of the transmission. The car is a joy to drive.  It truly is a performance luxury vehicle.

We bought our S-type with 36,000 miles, and within two months the transmission went out (Jaguar said it needed to be replaced with a rebuilt for $7K; we had it fixed elsewhere for $3.8K, but still, ouch).  The windshield washer pump also failed ($500), a rattle in the dash has cropped up, the AM radio can't hold a station (how hard is it to make an AM radio work?), and there is an intermittent warning light just comes on and off randomly.  We love the way this car handles and looks, but can't wait to get rid of it."

Only complaint.  Rattles - air vents in 
front dash appear cheap and are prone 
to rattle.  A little bit of a squeak in 
the rear somewhere.  Will bring both 
issue to Jag's attention at next

jaguar,s-type,2002,Old Irish, 01/01/2018,A great second car!,4,"I have to disclaimer this.  I am a long time Jaguar owner/collector, biased to the marque.  We bought this car from a local dealer we know because we temporarily needed another car in the household.  I bought it with 115,000 miles on it and put almost another 10,000 on it over 2+ years of ownership.  I bought this car because it was a one owner, well maintained car.  My advice on buying an older Jag sedan is that if you don't know the service history, assume it's going to need major service, which can be expensive.  Even so, they will require a degree of maintenence as components reach the end of their serviceable life.  During my ownership I replaced the driver sear module, replaced brakes and the ignition switch.  I bought a Sport model with the 3.0 six, a nice engine with great torque and moves this car down the road well.  When I first drove the S-Type in 2000, I thought it was the best handling sedan I had driven.  The Sport model with better suspension and seats didn't disappoint.  A lovely car to drive.  Four of us traveled comfortably on a 1,000 mile road trip.  These cars are now over a decade and a half old.  Great value for money if you get the right one, choose wisely!

jaguar,s-type,2002,mjmcdaniel, 09/16/2008,Great Automobile!,4,"I am thinking of buying a new car, however, I hate to give this one up!  It has been one of the best cars that I have ever owned.  I have had absolutely no trouble with it at all.  I have kept it serviced and have never had to have any repair work done."
jaguar,s-type,2002,Nice Little Cat, 12/16/2008,Not The 80's Jag Nightmare,4,"I just bought this car pre-owned for my fiance and despite my objections being a previous Jag owner (1995 XJ8) that was junk, the S-type seems to be a much needed improvement. Nicely laid out inside & out, runs well, but compared to my BMW 528i, the gas mileage on the Jag for a V6 is horrible. Handles well for such a heavy car and picks up nice on the highway. Currently has 85000 miles and looks brand new inside and out! Compliments have been incredible and common. Certainly a car for somebody looking for something different. I'm hoping the Ford influence pays off on this higher mileage Jag. Looks like we paid 3 times more then what we did, the neighbors are very jealous! "
jaguar,s-type,2002,Lorna, 01/09/2008,Love my Jag,4,"I love owning my Jaguar. Not only is it stylish to drive but it's also safe and comfortable to be in. Also, most drivers on the road are careful driving behind me and next to me because they would hate to pay for any damages incurred so that's a plus also."
jaguar,s-type,2002,Bill Weigold, 08/25/2004,What a car,4,"I've had this car for about 6 weeks 
and if your looking for something 
different, then this is the car. I've 
been driving a Toyota Avalon and was 
looking to upgrade. But although the 
styles of the various cars were 
different from the outside, once I sat 
in them, it was just another Avalon - 
and the Avalon was a great car. This 
really moves down the highway and you 
need to be careful because at 80, you 
feel as if your no moving as the ride 
is so smooth. It's great on turns as 
if it was hugging the road and 
although I didn't rate the gas mileage 
very high, I've been getting around 21 
to 22 miles per gallon. It's a great 
car if you want to be noticed. "
jaguar,s-type,2002,Gordon, 08/08/2005,I love this car!,4,"Before I bought the car, I've heard a lot of horror stories about Jags, but after seeing so many positive JD Power reviews, I decided to buy the S-Type. I've always loved its elegant styling and the sexy lines, and I still think this is the best looking car out there.  The S-Type has been extremely reliable, the signal light bult went out twice, but it's really no big deal, dealer took care of it for me (Got Certified used, 6 yr/100,000 mile warranty). The interior is very nice, the leather still looks and smell new. Although it's a bit harder because I do have the optional sports package.  After driving the car for 6 months, I still get a big smile whenever I see the car!"
jaguar,s-type,2002,I.K., 03/25/2002,Honest Review,5,"Bought the S-Type a year ago. Love the looks. Mercedes/BMW/Acura all look too plain and old to me, especially the cheap-looking interior on Beamers. S-type definitely has something exotic and different about it. Hand-carved wood/lamb leather/other interior parts are top-notch. V6 engine wishes for better performance. 240 horses aren&#8217;t adequate for the heavy body. Acceleration is quite jumpy, especially when downshifting. Very nice handling for the price of tight suspension. Had very loud clicking noise in steering wheel shaft, took it to dealership 4 times before they finally took it apart and replaced it. Overall, it's a very good vehicle and definitely the biggest head-turner for the price"
jaguar,s-type,2002,katee314, 03/02/2007,Wonderful Car!! 2002 Best Year Yet!!,4,I have had my Jaguar for about 22 months. It has been excellent to drive and thrill to ride in. Interior should be a little more roomier in the rear. I love the memory seats and dual temperature settings. Not to mention the heated seats are wonderful. I do wish it had remote starting. I agree it is the best looking car I have seen. Even for the newer model cars for 2006/2007.  
jaguar,s-type,2002,jag man, 04/15/2007,4.0 S-Type Sport,5,"The best car I have ever owned..  Prestige and sportiness in one package. The interior leather has held up excellent. Paint, fit and finish are superb.  I receive comments all the time about this Jag.  Only complaint is the smallish trunk and soft brakes. The car has been very reliable.  Had valve cover leaking, covered under warranty. The car is very fast, smooth, drives like a bimmer in sport mode.  Sure to be a classic."
jaguar,s-type,2002,fd1000, 05/16/2002,Better Then Expected,4,"I just purchased a 2002 S-Type V8 
Sport.  So far I have been impressed 
with its smooth ride, and quick 
acceleration.  This is the first car I 
have had in a long time, that made me 
say ""I NEED A RADAR DETECTOR!"", because 
you could get in trouble with this 
thing, it's fast!

Of course the greatest thing about this 
car is, one, its a Jag, and two, it 
turns the heads.  I was three blocks 
away from the dealership, just picked 
up the car new, and I was already 
gettin admiring looks for strolling 
members of the opposite sex.  THAT, 
puts a smile on your face...  Don't 
think you would get that kind of 
reaction with a 530i, or an E class.  
Life is good."
jaguar,s-type,2002,Michael Reis, 02/26/2002,Pleasantly Surprised,4,"This is my first Jag replacing my 5th Mercedes, the last being a very reliable 91' 300E. So far the build quality of this 2002 S-Type Jag and the V8 gas mileage is surprisingly good. Hope the reliability/durability hold up per current JD Power ratings.

BTW, I just changed the rear mufflers and now the V8 snarls nicely."
jaguar,s-type,2002,Imuniq, 02/01/2004,A Love and Hate Relationship,3,"I like this car because it's very 
stylish, but it's not very practical 
for daily use.  The trunk is too small 
to be useful, and the gas tank is too 
small, especially for the hungry V8 
engine (I have to fill up almost every 
3 days!).  It has been very reliable 
except the VERY fragile and low 
foglight lenses have been breaking 
every 6 months."
jaguar,s-type,2002,Dr Nev, 06/21/2002,I love my Jag!,4,"Granted, I have only owned 4 different 
auto styles, but I have driven 
countless others.  My 2002 Jag S-Type 
(3.0 V6 sport) is the most fun car I 
have ever driven.  I love the way it 
handles and despite the smoothness of 
the ride, I still can feel the road.  
My only complaint is that the same as 
everyone else's:  Not enough interior 
storage space!"

jaguar,s-type,2002,mjde, 10/05/2005,Jag S type,4,"This is my second S-Type, and it has performed perfectly as both a long- distance and commuting (30 miles each way) car.  Fun to drive, safe, decent mileage (19.5 city, 25 highway) and great looks.  Used great split rear seats and large trunk to carry guitars, cooler, suitcases for road trips."

beautiful silver S-Type remains in the 
same perfect condition as the day it was 
delivered to our home. (We still talk 
about that.) The car continues to turn 
heads and verbal compliments are common. 
All the reliability Ford promised to 
bring to Jaguar products appears to be 
present in our car. Drives and looks 
great!"

Outstanding vehicle in every respect, especially ""head-turning quotient"" orignated by Warren Brown.  (His summary of the S-Type: smooth, powerful, stylish -- it's car as art.)  Hard to understand previous customer's so-so numerical review in light of his/her verbal praise.  See to believe..."
jaguar,s-type,2002,Demi Hinmon, 11/20/2002,Jaguar S-Type,4,"Car has 17"" Pirelli tires which cause 
fairly severe steering wheel shimmy at 
45-60 mph when the tires are cold.  
Occasionally experience same shimmy at 
45-60 mph even when tires are warm.  
Repeated attempts to correct have 
failed.  Jaguar will not warrant the 
problem because I have non-factory 
chrome wheels."
jaguar,s-type,2002,petersouth, 04/04/2002,Don't believe the hype,2,"Purchased for girlfriend.  Test drove 
the Audi A6, Lexus GS300, Acura RL, and 
Q45.  She had to have the Jag for the 
status I guess.  I was very disgusted 
in her decision. You get very little 
vehicle for the price you pay.  Paid 
for the ""Premium"" stereo, sound quality 
is marginal at best.  Single 
cupholder?  Completely unacceptable for 
a 50,000 vehicle.  Seats are not that 
comfortable.  Sloppy transmission. Very 
poor resale and , I don't care what 
other reviewers have said, there are 
too many cheap looking interior bits. 
When comparing this car side by side 
with the above mentioned, it is VERY 
difficult to understand the logic in 
the purchase.  Must be the cat on the 
hood."
jaguar,s-type,2002,Jacques Brazeau, 12/01/2002,My test of the 2002 Jaguar S model,5,"I have purchased this vehicle in mid summer and it is not winter and I like 
every bit of it, so far. I have had a wee bit experience in snow but I have 
cured the problem, by adding weight in the trunk. Remember in snow,it is 
useally behind the wheel that counts."
jaguar,s-type,2002,pdalon, 01/07/2003,Very Pleased,4,"A real ""eye-catcher"" and thrill to 
drive.
I've never owned an automobile that

this car long enough to rate 
mechanically, but I have had 
absolutely no problems. Highly 
recommend if you want something 
everyone else isn't driving."
jaguar,s-type,2002,BLONDDIE66, 05/02/2008,2002 S Type,4,"I purchased my 2002 in 2005 with 29K miles. This was my 3rd Jaguar over a 25 year driving history. The 2 previous Jaguars (XJ6) had been purchased in the late 80s/early 90s (used) were nightmares. I owned 3 SUVs after the XJ6s. My S Type has given me few problems. It needed a tune up (1 coil pack went bad) after 100K miles, a couple of cracked vacuum lines and a cracked radiator overflow tank. I love the car, but I drive it like I drove my SUVs and it takes it. You can't beat the interior luxury and the sylish exterior. I bought the Euro mesh grill on Ebay to update it. It's 6 years old now and people give me compliments about it all the time."
jaguar,s-type,2003,Richard, 04/15/2016,Great Car If You Can Find a Good One,4,"If you like the way the car looks and drives and can find one with relatively low miles, that has been maintained and hasn't been too abused, go for it. I'm happy that I did. The S Type from 2003 on has an improved drive train, interior, and reliability. Stay on top of leaks and maintenance and it should hold up fine. The car drives super smooth and with the NA 4.2 V8 is pretty quick. If you want to have the most elegant car at the drag strip go for the R model, if you don't like to drive fast a V6 model is the most plentiful and still has 240 HP for passing other cars. Ford has made Jaguar a better car and much more reliable than the ones from the 80's and 90's, going from the bottom of the reliability lists to the top. With the rear seats folded down there is a lot of storage in back, making it practical too. Don't use the car for carrying gravel or firewood though, the car is too dignified for that. Because most people think that a Jaguar is going to explode at any moment they are a bargain for what you get too.
"
jaguar,s-type,2003,bpagano, 08/16/2013,WOW!,4,I just purchased a 2003 S-type. I couldn't be happier. It had 82K miles on it and drives like its brand new. I cant believe I own a Jag. I happy as heck......
jaguar,s-type,2003,Dave Collett, 04/05/2016,A great luxury car value after New wears off,5,"18 months after buying this Jag, and 17.000 miles, I still really enjoy driving it. I was amazed to find, on long, 75 mph desert highways that the mileage with this V8 went over 40 mpg consistently; that included 5,000 - 8,000 foot changes in altitude. 

At 83,000, I started to lose coils (COP). after 3 failed done separately, I did the other 5 in a batch. You don't have to pay $169 each at a dealer. The coils are available online for as little as $18 each. Of course, the first 3 I bought were ""I need it now"" and purchased from Autozone for $50 each. Not that bad. First failure I replaced the spark plug too, but it was in such nice shape I didn't on the other 7 cylinders, and my performance and mileage are still good.

jaguar,s-type,2003,Linda Wells, 08/25/2006,What's not to love!,4,"This car is an absolute pleasure.  It's everything I hoped it would be. I have no complaints.

jaguar,s-type,2003,jjandaa, 03/20/2011,I love this car!!!,4,"I bought my car in 2005 with 10k miles on it.
It is my all the time car and now has 97k miles on it.
The only problems I have had is the front driver side barren went out, replaced the brakes twice, and the electronic e-brake went out (which I have not replace).
I do not considered these major problems.
I love this car and complete recommend it to any one.
I do not plan on replacing it anytime soon.
I have been through 2 major accidents and have never been hurt.
The car still rides smooth and if you look at it you would never know it has been through the accidents."
jaguar,s-type,2003,Midwest STR, 12/27/2006,Unbelievable!,5,"This car is nothing short of incredible! Be prepared for massive stares of envy wherever you go. It's nice to have a vehicle that has enough speed to leave, even those hemi powered vehicles gasping for breath. The passing  power is world class. It leaves all but the world's fastest cars on the highway. Plain and simple. This car will stop, corner and then speed with the same authority as any performance car costing over a hundred thousand dollars.  I just love this car."
jaguar,s-type,2003,billnov20, 09/07/2008,A real head turner,5,"Bought this British Racing Green vehicle from the dealer with 41,000 miles.  Came with a 100,000 mile warranty.  Car is immaculate inside and out. Added beehive grille, chrome pillars and side mirrors.  Vehicle looks like it just came off the assembly line.  Power is awesome, car is quiet and comfortable.  Vehicle now has 131,000 miles and going great.  Biggest expense to date was replacement of passenger side Xenon Headlight Assembly (leveling device went).  Real pain to change burnt headlamp bulb.  Bumper needs to be dropped adding a big cost for a simple problem."
jaguar,s-type,2003,nh, 11/16/2010,Great Performance and Style,4,"This car is startlingly fast! Despite being a 4000 lb luxury sedan it corners like a sports car. Breaks are great! I get tons of looks and compliments on the styling. The R has much better proportions than the standard S-Type.  The wood and leather interior is very classy. I prefer it to the modernized XF interior. Dealer Repair costs are extremely high... especially if there is only one Jag dealer locally. Most independent shops refuse to touch this car, however even after 80,000 miles this car has only been to the shop a handful of times. My only real complaint  is about the small size of the tank. I travel a lot and I wish I could go over 400 miles between petrol stops."
jaguar,s-type,2003,RST, 08/03/2002,Wow....Former Lexus Driver is wowed by,4,"I owned five Lexus Cars before jumping 
to a Jaguar S Type R earlier this year.
The folks at Lexus seemed to have no 
interest in retaining a repeat 
customer, (my wife and I both had 
them, LS 400 and RX 300).
I am so happy I made the switch.  The 
staff at the dealership is fabulous, 
they actually remember your name.  And 
contrary to what folks have said in 
the past, this Jag works great, NO 
repeat NO quality problems.  I can't 
think of a rattle or a squeak to 
complain about.  
You have to drive this car to 
appreciate it..a nice commuter car 
during the week and a hell raiser on 
weekends...
I'm a convert..I might just end up 
with five.."
jaguar,s-type,2003,Doc, 02/18/2009,I love it,4,"My cat had 30k miles on it when I bought it.  I was very impressed with the power from a V6. As far as reliability goes--a bolt fell out of the J-gate at 35k, temp sensor failed,so no heat, a PLASTIC part of the self adjusting HID lights failed.  All fixed under warranty.  Now at 70K I have spent $1200 in the lst week to replace the PLASTIC radiator overflow tank and then a radiator hose with a PLASTIC  part in it that broke. Jaguar- -do you see a trend here??? Great looking car, great driving car, comfortable and economical in the gas department. I drive on flat highways in Florida and see low 30's all the time. If you put your foot in it, it will growl and take off. I love the exhaust growl."
jaguar,s-type,2003,Lean Consultant, 03/12/2010,Life Cycle of the S Type,4,"I purchased this car from a private party that fell on hard times after only putting 4100 miles on it.  I love the styling of the vehicle and wanted the 4.2 liter V8.  This car was to be my dream car.  After seven years, I have to admit that it has lived up to most of my expectations.  The original warranty, and then the extended warranty I purchased later, covered just about everything I could have requested.  I get approximately 22 MPG with about 80% of my driving on the freeways of Southern California.  By using Michelin touring tires I find that the ride cushion and quietness are better than I had expected.  I compare the acceleration with what I had as a kid with my '64 Olds 442."
jaguar,s-type,2003,Snook, 12/30/2003,Awesome,5,"I have had this car for about nine 
months and I haven't had any problems. 
The car performs very well and is 
certainly a head turner. I have had 
many people say that they really like 
the way that this car looks. I 
appreciate the new renovations this 
year as opposed to the last years model."
jaguar,s-type,2003,sv, 04/01/2006,Don't mess with gorgeous,4,"Outstanding bargain as a 2003 thanks to Jag's old reputation for unreliability. Best performance sedan under 60K. Has been very reliable so far. Nothing more than scheduled maintenance. Impressive performance, especially if you factor in the automatic and all the Jaguar nanny electronics (delimiter, Traction, etc). Gorgeous exterior that gets looks everywhere. It's acceleration sneaks up on other performance cars, especially M3s and M5s. Interior fit and finish is excellent and sumptuous. Brakes are grabby (good) and stop the car with authority. The mesh grill and fat 275 tires make the car. Supercharger whine is music over 3500rpm. Butt-dyno feels like a 4.8-4.9s car, not 5-5.2."
jaguar,s-type,2003,JD, 08/07/2015,Clock,5,"The clock needs to be easier to set.  I gave up on changing it for daylight savings time. I love my Jag. My son bought it when he got out of the Navy.  One month later he said he was going to trade it in. That it was an old man's car. I told him I would give him my 2002 Chevrolet Impala that was paid for and I would take over the Jag. I got the better deal.

Thought this was a good investment for years to come. Thought it would be reliable, considering it was a jag.The first 2 years were ok-the tranny and oil pans were leaking, minor really. We had them repaired.The last 1 1/2 years have been difficult to say the least. The car has had its instrument cluster put into a fridge, dash lights have done off/on while driving at night, cd player problems, heating controller malfunctions,exhaust issues, other elect issues, and most recently the lower control arm needs to be rpl-it leaks($1100.00) Show me the money-looks great!"

The elegance of the car enhances the great look.  You feel like you are in an expensive resort.  The deep hue of the wood, the buttery soft leather, the smooth coolness of the steering wheel, just perfect.  The refined ride is a great complement to the quiet interior and the nav system is easy to use.  I Know it has only been a week, but  wow, I love this car!!"
jaguar,s-type,2003,cburl, 08/09/2009,Mustang to Jag,4,"Like MikeL, I went from a Mustang to Jag. Jag was a executive car for major dealership, so I'm first private owner. Was well cared for and maintain. Most think it's brand new. No problems whatsoever, and the guys at the dealership miss her. Love the ride as extremely quiet and relaxing. All black leather with silver exterior nice, but heats up in the summer sun. Garaged most of time. AC quiet even at full blast as to not drown out cd. All in all, excellent and attention getting ride. They lose value after newness, as the window sticker showed $47,478 and I got this perfect specimen for under $10,000. Maybe the economy and I was paying cash. Couldn't think of a greater value."
jaguar,s-type,2003,Jaglover, 07/17/2010,Love this car,4,"We purchased our Jag used a few years ago. It had about 48,000 miles on it at the time and had been a lease vehicle.

I now have 60 mi on it and have the following to report.  The supercharger in the car works great, and I love the fact that I can beat almost anybody that pulls up next to me with such a classy vehicle.  I also get many compliments on it.  Now for the bad stuff.  The dual heating system in mine is already having problems and heat seems to blow from some vents when the AC is on.  I'm told it's a $1500 problem to solve.  Also the plastic bevel and cup holders in the back are cheaply made and will break.  Visor mirror covers are made of the same junk plastic and have also broken.  Still like it so far!"
jaguar,s-type,2003,myjag3, 02/15/2015,interior quality design flaws,3,Bought the car new.  The interior is made cheaply and has flaws.  The headliner fell down after a few years and is expensive to replace.  The vanity mirrors have covers that break off easily.  The cigarette lighter works some of the time.  The clock and radio require the manual to reset as it is not easy to remember.
jaguar,s-type,2003,Baka_Otaku173, 03/31/2010,Luxurious yet fussy,4,"About 3 weeks ago, I purchased this vehicle and boy was I proud. I am 25 and driving a Jag. Luckily I also kept my trusty 04 Honda Accord just in case and now I am glad that I did. The Jag started to act funny within 2 weeks of purchase. The light bulbs fried, the transmission makes funny noises if not warmed up (driven for over 30 mins), the steering makes a clanking noise when turning hard. I am honestly becoming quite concerned over this vehicle. But the price for it was great! Worse case scenario, over the life of the vehicle I'll throw in some money to keep it running as long as possible. It is a JAGUAR in the end. Known for their temperamental behaviors. "

problems but the dealer here in Austin, 
TX took care of everything in a very 
satisfactory manner, and always 
provided a Jag loaner car. It is the 
best car I have owned for driving on 
the highway and around town. I usually 
have driven Cadillacs."
jaguar,s-type,2003,jagman73, 03/13/2004,Great Sports Sedan,4,"I purchased a 2003 S-Type with the 5-
speed manual transmission.  Great 
performance, smooth shifting, very nice 
exhaust note on acceleration.  
Absolutely no problems to report.  The 
car is beautifully styled inside and 
out, fit and finish is top-notch.  I 
average right at 20 mpg around town, 
and took a 4 hour highway trip recently 
and the computer indicated 31.5 mpg.  
My third Jag and the best yet."
jaguar,s-type,2003,Charles R, 04/07/2007,Excellent All Around Luxury Sports Sedan,4,"This car flat out moves.  Very fast acceleration and very good braking.  This car has a nice balance of ride and handling.  The one wheel drive will spin very easily though, positive traction should definitely be on this car.  The fun part is that it will smoke the tires at will if you are into that type of thing (who... me?).  The interior is gorgeous, the seats are uber comfortable and the car is very quiet... until you gas it hard, that is.  People often complain about the loudness of the supercharger, but I love it.  People stare at this car, it is definitely a head turner.  Have had no problems with this car yet."
jaguar,s-type,2003,Joe, 05/23/2007,Silk Cat / Sharp Claws,4,"After 52,000 miles still an amazing driving experience. Rock sold body structure and build quality.  Still turns heads and elicits admiring comments with its timeless design. Engine and powertrain among the best on the planet. Rocket-like acceleration and cat like handling when you want it, civility when you don't. Had a failure of the adaptive HID headlight (left side) out of warranty, but Jag paid 1/2 the bill. Just noticed grease seal leak on right rear suspension. Interior temperature sensor replaced last year to fix malfunctioning A/C. That's it for repairs. Mid 20s highway mileage very reasonable"
jaguar,s-type,2003,Kent, 09/02/2007,My Ride Jaguar S Type,4,"Having done my due diligence test driving a used BMW and Benz - both fine my wife loves hers - I selected Jag 03 S Type V6 with 18K miles + factory warranty. No paintwork, no smoker, fully loaded, all keys and manuals. Out the door from used dealer at around $20K maybe the best used car I ever bought. Love the ZF 5Spd automatic - snickity snick - there's a learning curve to get the RPMs up there where it's fun to drive. Mine is dark grey metallic, light grey fine leather interior. Looks right at home at the Country Club and in a pinch I've even lowered the back seats and hauled 8 ft lumber!  Great car, buy it right, find one with some warranty and enjoy! "
jaguar,s-type,2003,Eric Erickson, 05/05/2003,The S-Type is solid and stylish!,4,"The S-type Jag, 4.0 V-8 sports model is 
one hot machine. It doesn't lean into 
sharp curves, but hugs the road like a 
magnet on a refrigerator. This car is 
solid, with no squeeks or creaks. Don't 
confuse it with your father's Ford. 
Don't confuse these beauties with Jags 
from the past that had electrical and 
other problems. Ford has focused on 
quality - and they have delivered."
jaguar,s-type,2003,Mickeyfin, 10/12/2019,Owned this car 16 years,5,"I love this car, it is beautiful, a V8, comfortable, classy. I replaced the transmission at 75,000 miles. Had minor fixes on the interior headliner. I am very used to the J transmission, no problems. It had 79,000 on it now, I have 3 cars so it will last another 15 years. I look at new cars and see few advantages and no style. I love my cat. It handles very well, is fast. I have kept it perfect, like a spoiled car should be kept. 
"
jaguar,s-type,2003,John, 04/19/2006,The Cat's Meow,4,"This car has standard suspension and has excellent handling and braking.  The interior layout is just fair. It lacks thoughtful displays a dedicated driver needs; eg, the information panels are tiny, LCD panels that cannot be read when wearing polarized lenses.  The old J-gate transmission shifter needs updating.  The auto on/off lights and wipers are terrific.  The seats are extremely comfortable, even in back, where the seats can fold down.  Unfortunately the trunk is so designed as to limit access of some larger boxes."
jaguar,s-type,2003,pbomgardner, 04/28/2008,Corvette in a Tuxedo,4,"This car has been a dream to own. It has required nothing other than the normal maintenance, and even that has been surprisingly inexpensive. The car is elegantly understated and is very subtle in appearance. However, all of the subtlety changes when the gas pedal is used. This car is a rocket - like the title idicates, it is a Corvette in a tuxedo! It handles superbly, goes like the wind, and it does it all with style and grace. I could not ask for a better vehicle, and when it does come time to trade, I am going to have a very hard time deciding what to replace it with. HMMM - maybe a pre-owned Supercharged FX is in my future! This Jag has it all - elegance, performance, and reliability."
jaguar,s-type,2003,lschuch, 08/22/2002,Number 2 and counting,5,"This is my second S-Type.  Traded my 
2000 V-8 for the new 2003 S-Type R.  
What a car!!! Calling the 
engine/transmission combination superb 
would be a huge understatement.  I 
can't believe how much better this car 
is than my 2000, which is by far the 
best car that I have ever owned.  Build 
quality is incredible, no problems at 
all with the 2000 and the quality of 
the '03 appears to be even better.  
Don't know how they did that.  This is 
now the best car ever."
jaguar,s-type,2003,Seeabe, 09/24/2002,This cat purrs but doesn't roar,4,"The best looking sedan on the road - by 
far.  Nothing beats the style of this 
car, inside and out.  This is my second 
Jag - my first a '95 XJ6 was also a 
dream.  I wish I'd opted for the 4.0 
(don't like the R, I want the chrome)- 
the 3.0 6 cyl lacks response in lower 
gears.  After having driven a BMW 5 
series for the last 3 years, I was used 
to lightning quick excitement.  Still, 
the beauty, grace and ride quality are 
more than worth the trade-off in 
acceleration.  And did I say it was the 
best looking car on the road?  This is 
a head-turner - no mistaking this car 
for anything but a Jag.  I am so sold 
on Jags I got an X-type for my daughter."
jaguar,s-type,2003,R. Leverson, 09/23/2002,Jaguar S type 4.2 Sport package,4,"I have had this car a short time and 
put 2500 miles on it. This was more 
than enough to tell I made a good 
choice. It handles like it should have 
no fenders and paddle shifters (just 
kidding). Seriously the best handling 
sedan I have ever driven and I have 
owned three BMW's in the past 15 years 
plus a cadillac STS which was somewhat 
of a dissapointment in all respects.
This car has looks,performance, and 
handling. What more could you want."
jaguar,s-type,2003,beachman, 10/21/2002,Former Vette Owner Sold on Jag S-Type V8,4,"With only 1,500 miles on the odometer, I absolutely love my 2003 S-type.
Having been used to gut wrenching off the line performance from my Vette, I 
was really apprehensive about the major shift in ownership.  The Jag is 
second to none on interior and exterior quality and workmanship (something 
that has always been my sore point with the Vettes).  The 4.2 Liter has not 
disappointed me in the least.  The seats are excellent in comfort and the 
high quality of leather is wonderful.  Did not go with the sport option, mainly 
as an an eye appeal decision.  I like the natural wood, and chrome trim 
rather than the gray wood.  Just a wonderful car inside and out."
jaguar,s-type,2003,John M, 11/25/2002,Nothing compares with this beauty,5,"I am in the process of purchasing my 
third S-Type. No car on the road today 
has the appeal of this modern classic. 
The reto look has given me the chance 
to drive a Jag from the E-Type era, 
with the curves of the XJ6 Series 2. 
The lines on this car make it stunning 
and down-right beautiful.  For the many 
years I waited for a modern XKE, I find 
myself driving a S-Type and not the XK8 
or XKR. This car is a gem."
jaguar,s-type,2003,elibruno, 01/13/2003,cant believe its a jaguar!,5,"after 13 bmws, i made a move for the 
jaguar because of its standard safety 
features and its timeless beauty. I 
also opted for the V6 which i knew is a 
derivative of the Ford Duratec, one of 
the best and most reliable 6's out 
there. nothing has disappointed me; i 
got the sport package which better 
approximates a BMW type of ride and has 
bigger brakes-a plus with Florida 
drivers! And the ZF 6 speed automatic 
is superior to anything short of the 
745i.  Put a thousand miles on the 
first week of all types of road 
conditions with 23 MPG! So far, so 
great!"
jaguar,s-type,2003,Very satisfied owner, 02/14/2003,What a Fabulous Vehicle,4,"If there is a more satisfying luxury 
mid-sized ride in the world, I don't 
know what it could be.  The S-Type 
Jaguar is the first of many fine autos 
I've owned that meets or exceeds all of 
my lofty expectations.  The only 
negative is that my standards have now 
become so demanding that I suspect I 
can never be as happy with any other 
car.  The fit and finish is superb and 
the styling is the best of any other 
car in its class.  The only equipment 
improvement would be to create a more 
compact key remote design (it's 
impossible to attach other keys with 
the current fob).  Be sure to get the 
Performance Package with adjustable 
pedals and steering etc."
jaguar,s-type,2003,Bruce Rogers, 09/04/2003,Not like Jaguars of the past,4,"This is my second S type.  I bought a 
2002 S type 4.0, liked it so much I put 
24000 miles on in 11 months.  So I 
decided to upgrade to the S type R and 
it is a headturner that is an absolute 
pleasure to drive. Despite the 
supercharged power I still get very 
good fuel economy.  Its like driving a 
Porsche sedan."

Turns are effortless, does not driv 
like a 4-door.  I just wish it would 
stay on the road and not in the shop.  
first a fron right suspension

jaguar,s-type,2003,M Bathurst, 03/06/2005,Mid-Life Crisis Muscle Car,4,"I have driven a Porsche 911 SC Targo foralmost 20 years.  Decided it was time to grow up.  Love the S Type R.  Plan was to drive it for a couple of years, thengo back to a Porsche.  Probably, won'thappen.  Class, style, comfort and catquick.  The muscle car you wanted in the60's with luxury.  Fuel consumption on the open road is very good, considering the engine.  In town, I only have my right foot to blame.  Although, a heavy car, it handles like it is on a rail.  I have not had the car long enough to discuss reliabilty.  I completely enjoy the car; and, have a teenage son that is drooling about the chance to drive it (there is a chance - a fat one)."

Its been a fun 3 years even though there have been some second thoughts while the car sat in the shop for a variety of problems.  The car is beautiful (yea, if you try real hard, you can see some resemblance to the Taurus, especially the back end). I get plenty of looks and smiles. The interior was our real decision point. It is probably the most beautiful interior of any car out there.  Performance is incredible. Can a car have too much power? Maybe, especially for city driving.  Main complaint - always wants to go and hard to control at slow speeds. Next car - ??"
jaguar,s-type,2003,lflouie, 01/12/2006,Quick Silver Cat,4,"Great combo of performance, style, and luxury. Competent handling at 8/10ths, great acceleration only limited by ""open"" rear end, electronic trac control and lazy ECU that limits revs in lower gears. Incredible suspension for great ride and good all around handling. Gets more looks (especially females) than my M5 and is much a more enjoyable ride around town. Had a few annoying but non-critical electrical glitchs, overall releiability is good but build quailty is only average. 28 mpg on the hwy..WOW. I love the car... it's unique, stylish, comfortable, quick, and overall a very competent sport sedan. Used prices offer an incredible value if you're the buyer. LOVE IT! "

Oh yes and the brake deployed while traveling down the road. a quick fix and no foul.  Thankfully this car has 6/10000 warranty on it as it was bought as a ""select edition"" so I am hoping it will be addressed by the dealer in the near future so far they have been very helpful."
jaguar,s-type,2003,WileCoyote, 01/02/2006,Great Car in need of pampering,4,The Supercharger makes this car a rocket and the styling over the normal S-Type is tremendous.  That car flies and stops on a dime.  The bake squeal drives me nuts as does the new steering whine.  Overall that monster eats traffic for lunch.  It's a great car that I think needs more attention that should have had been addressed at build time.  I'll probably keep it for a while and then go for an E55 or M5. It's a great looking car that performs and I'm glad I have not had the types of trouble others have had.  It sure does turn heads.
jaguar,s-type,2003,Jaguar S-Type R, 01/08/2006,Jaguar Sports Car,4,"Most exciting car, I ever owned was a Jag XKE 1962. Except it was a pain to keep running. This is quite a car and I have owned BMW 2002, 735i and 740i. Wife doesn't even realize when I go around curves fast lol."
jaguar,s-type,2003,onewhocares, 02/15/2004,A pleasant surprise!,5,"We bought this car after looking at 
the BMW, MB, and the Lexus.  The look, 
price, performance, 6-speed 
transmission, and feature content were 
the reasons we chose the s-type.  The 
car has over 5000 miles and has been 
relatively trouble free (the 
electronic parking brake failed and 
was replaced).  The steering is 
precise and nicely weighted for both 
city and highway driving.  The V-8 and 
6-speed transmission combination makes 
merging into the 80 mph california 
traffic a easy task.  Highway mileage 
has been 31 to 29 miles per galloon at 
average speeds of 70 to 80 miles per 
hour."
jaguar,s-type,2003,robin3263, 10/23/2004,Style lacking quality,4,"This car has superior style and 
performance. The flashy style attracts 
a lot of attention. The service is 
lacking the same quality the car lacks. 
They seem to prefer to argue that the 
car is not defective than to actually 
take the time to fix it. I drove their 
X-type loaner as much as I drove my car 
(not really, but it seems excessive). 
12 repairs in 2 years. I traded it with 
20K left on the warranty and an air 
conditioner problem they didn't fix 
during the first service. Jaguar style 
with Ford quality and service."
jaguar,s-type,2003,Paul, 03/22/2005,2003 needs help,3,"Love look of car, always a head turner. Been in shop avg of 1x per month, unacceptable.  Tranny slips, especially in turns and when slowing. Would never own unless I had a warranty AND the free rental. 3 recalls since I have owned.  Had it not been a great deal on a demo car, I would not have pulled the trigger to purchase.  Can sell today for what I paid for it.  Will probably sell in a year with warranty left.  Don't buy the ivory interior if you have kids.  It shows everything and is not the easiest to clean.  I have a gold color that hides a lot of dirt, but the brakes dust drives me crazy.  To keep wheels looking nice, have to clean EVERY week even though the car is not dirty."
jaguar,s-type,2003,Aaron, 03/21/2006,Love this car!!,5,"Just purchased an S-type 4.2 after trading in my Mercedes E320.  Wow what a difference.  This car will blow anything away with its 300 hp. I noticed after having the car for just a couple of days that they brakes were squeaking.  The dealership ended up replaceing the brakes in the front for FREE.  Something that is not even covered in warranty, so needless to say, we are happy.  I love my British Racing Green Jag!!! "
jaguar,s-type,2003,alexander,RG,"So far, pretty good",3,"Some poor engineering design like seats that don't go back far enough for easy entrance and exit. A 16 gallon gas tank for a supercharged engine that gets about 12 miles to the gallon overall. Headlights that keep failing and a odometer and other information display that is so poor that it can't be read unless the outside light hits it at exactly the right angle, which is practically never."

Bought it with 20,000 miles on it and have taken it to only the dealer for service. Head light leveling device went out, $932.75. Clunk in rear end at low speeds, replace flange-output, $586.63. Brakes and rotors,$1,779.57. Dealer said sorry for first two items. I expected to pay for brakes. They said it is out of warranty, which is 4 years or 50,000 miles. Even Hyundai has a 10 year and 100,000 miles! I have owned three BMWs and great backup in the past.  I owned a 62'Jaguar XKE convertible and loved it's driving but hated it unreliability."

jaguar,s-type,2003,MCA, 10/01/2007,Luxurious Performance,4,"I bought this 3 yr old car with 6K miles on it. The car is one of the most unique and beautiful styles on the road. The handling is very crisp with just a bit of understeer. The  acceleration is impressive, and as smooth as silk with the ZF 6-speed automatic. Braking is fine although the pedal is a little soft for my taste. The interior is truly comfortable and stylish. Quality is found inside and out. Mine has the optional navigation system which is simple to use and easy to see from the driver's position. I added the Audio Connectivity Module in 2006 which is backwards compatable for my model for $400 installed. It allows my iPod to be controlled through the touch screen on my dash."
jaguar,s-type,2003,Carlos C. Cardenas, 09/04/2007,First time Jag owner,4,The car style and curves sold me for a high quality 4 door sports car. I quickly experienced sluggish transmission issues. Then I started having interior electrical issues that started with the heated seats then cig. lighter now the moonroof is malfunctioning. I have kept an optimistic view that these were just minor issues. I still have a jerky and slow responding transmission after several visits to the dealership over a years time. I have to say that I like the responsiveness on the highway and the ride is comfortable.

Extremely quick and the transmission is 
seamless. Bought the car for it's great 
looks, but I'm starting to be more 
impressed by the quiet performance. My 
personal car is a Porsche Boxster, so 
now I have two top flight vehicles,

jaguar,s-type,2004,Lee Dolce, 04/08/2016,Used but like new,5,"I purchased my 2004  Jaguar ""S"" 3.0 two years ago in 2014 with eleven (11) years on the vehicle, but only 37K miles.  It was a Florida car, subject to the heat, humidity and salt air of the gulf coast... surprisingly, the Jaguar had a perfect interior, despite some minor door dings, the original paint and trim was excellent.  Within two months of the purchase, the ""S"" was driven from FL to California in a 2,900 mile 2.5 day high speed drive on Hwy 10 with no adverse effects and an uncommonly smooth ride over varied terrain, roads and temperatures.  Averaging over 30 miles per gallon, the Jaguar performed faultlessly at all speeds with the air conditioner under continuous use.  
Now housed in CA, I had a recent scare when a warning light indicated that the ""S"" had a ""gearbox fault"" and the transmission locked in 5th gear.... imagining the  need for a new transmission, the car was taken to a local Jaguar specialist who spent a shop hour updating the software and I was back on the road for a cost of $125.  Beside oil changes with synthetic blends, new windshield wiper blades, the replacement of the original Continentals with Pirelli P7s, and a K&N air filter, the Jaguar has cost me absolutely nothing in parts and repairs.
The classic exterior style of the ""S"", the beauty of the leather interior, the solid, yet comfortable ride of the suspension, and the overall performance of this vehicle demonstrates to me that for its $10K cost this is not only one of the best bargains on the road but also one of the best luxury sport sedans.

jaguar,s-type,2004,Bob Drago, 10/12/2015,not a honda nor toyota,5,"I understand those that complain about the repairs and dealer support but this car is no different than a BMW M class or an AMG unless you have money or are willing to turn a wrench you should stick with the Jap cars, this is not a mediocre car and same as any well-above-average vehicles there is a price to owning it. Yes the Jag is nto a very forgiving car (neither are any performance cars) if you don't pay attention to what it needs it will let you down and the cost of fixing everything will pile up quickly BUT if you do fix everything in time and you use good quality parts you will have a reliable superb vehicle. In reviewing vehicles one should stay away from including poor choice repair shops (yes you get what you pay for and more often than not you'll get less than that), for most smart people dealers are the places where you get a OEM screw or a small gasket but you'd do the major repairs at vetted mechanics not at dealers. On the same note it is your choice to go for ASE certified or just crowd vetted professionals (I consider ASE to stand for Ask Someone Else and they will see my money or touch my car in another life). The car... is superb, the engine electrical harness is a bit on the weird side meaning that the wires temp rating was very poorly selected, other than this the wishbone suspension is a great choice for comfort and not so great for repair but it is repairable; IF you are willing to invest either money or your time and effort. Other than the electrical weirdness I can't say anything negative about it, the car is powerful, smooth as a hoover, elegant, classy, refined, great on gas (I get 24mpg on hwy and 19 in the city with normal driving 80-85mph hwy and non aggressive yet not grandma' either for city driving). Keep in mind although is a 380 brake HP this is not an M5 this is a limo class car with sport ability it is not a sport car with limo ability... as the folks at top gear said ""you don't get in and drive this car you get in and proceed...""

jaguar,s-type,2004,Ron, 01/07/2016,low milage self destruct.,1,"Bought in 2013 with only 26k and all dealer maintenance records. It just turned 53k and the engine valve covers are leaking oil on the exhaust shields and fills the inside with burnt oil fumes. The dealer said it could also be the intake manifold gasket. In that case about a $2400 repair at least.  The transmission recently started to make noise and it just left on a tow truck because it locked up in park and wouldn't start. If Jaguar rebuilds the transmission it estimated $6000 at least. Which puts the repairs above what the cars value is. Add that to the fact I payed a premium price because it was so pristine makes for a bad Jaguar experience.
   
  Update: Miles 59k. Transmission problem was a bolt that fell out of shift linkage. Valve cover still leaks on exhaust shield just enough to smell bad. Had to replace the transmission pan assy. due to leaking. Trans still make a slight yelp sound when shifting up from 2nd to 3rd after coming out of a turn. And rear drivers side auto door lock stopped working. Just use as a grocery getter. Still looks like new. Don't want to pawn it off on someone else.

The flat torque band means very linear response, yet the car remains composed. 0-60 in 5.3s, 1/4mi in 13.5s, faster than you'll ever need. Very smooth in the city, but the CATS system really shines when you toss it into an off-camber turn. It's hard to upset this car.

Highly recommend getting at least 6 months of warranty coverage to initially fix problems.  Antifreeze is $17 per liter (Jag fluid only).

car, so be prepared to get lots of 
attention in it.
As for negatives, the upgraded Alpine 
system is good, but nowhere near the 
Bose systems found in many luxury 
cars.  
Also, ALL of the front speakers are in 
the doors, the system needs some 
tweeters on the dash for a more 
complete sound in the front of the 
car."

It is very comfortable and cruises great on any highway - smooth, fast, quiet, and 30+ mpg.  My spouse really loves it in every way.  But I pay the maintenance and repairs!! And at 30000 miles it has had a lot of repairs - radio (several times), transmission, heater valve, upper radiator hose, trunk, front wheel well, etc.  We have 5 vehicles and drive a lot of miles a year 85,000+.  I love to drive this car - it is my favorite, but the repairs are very disappointing."

My previous Jag was a 2002 S-Type Sport 4.0 which I thought was one of the best cars that I have owned until I bought the R model. It handles like a sports car, rides like a luxury car and is just beautiful. The car brakes with discipline and accelerates without question. The car is classic Jaguar but with an understated look of aggression. The rims are very in-line with the overall appearance of the car. Whenever I take someone in it, they just sit there, like in a daze, speechless. Love this car. "

day,  it didn't start!  Dealer 
unresponsive.  Their answer is ""You got

drivers car, with room for the entire

great commuter.  The effort of driving 
an M5 (without an automatic option) can 
be exhausting in heavy traffic, while 
on the phone, or with the kids. I love

types, because I love the classic 
Jaguar lines.  Upgrading each year is 
due to the engineering 
refinement and design enhancements.  
The R has the performance, power, 
handling, and flexibility in unique 
balance.  Nothing feels harsh 
which is rare in a 400hp rocket.  The 
Jaguar racing legacy is alive here.  
With the odd looking new BMW 500 
series, Jag investing in R-engineering 
will have a promising future.  I sense 
the E-Type racing heritage in this car, 
which makes it all worthwhile. And with 
5 seats my family can enjoy.      "

poor fuel economy, Jaguar helps out by 
covering major maintenance for the 
first 50k miles.

By the way, city driving is a 
pleasure.  Just don't plan on using 
this car for long distance family 
trips.  My recommedation, is use your 
other car presuming it is an SUV.  
While you're at it, buy your favorite

More value in the Jag S-R than BMW or 
M-B.  Felt that I had all the benefits 
of the M-5 or AMG for $25K less (and 
also beat the prices of the 545 and E-
500).

The 390 HP pulls strongly at all rev 
levels, but is also smooth in city 
driving.  The chassis/tires and 
computer controlled suspenswion can 
handle all of this with aplomb. The 
new Jag NAV system is excellent with 
an easily self replaceable DVD.  The 
advanced sound system, part of the R 
package, is quite good and easy to 
use, with voice, steering wheel, or 
dash controls.

Gas mileage has been 16-17 mpg in

power, acceleration, steering, 
handling, braking, luxury and 
refinement to be significantly superior 
to either the MB or BMW.  I purchased 
the Jaguar and after some 10,000 
trouble-free miles, I can report 
nothing but satisfaction. To suggest 
that this car is overpriced considering 
the competition is absurd. It leaves 
all manner of 540s, E-500s, etc. in its

you toss it around with confidence.  
The Brembo brakes are just awesome. 
Second is the looks and compliments 
you receive.  My wife and I joke about 
the looks we get from other S-Type

X-Typers.  For the money, I really 
dont think there is another car that 
can beat its performance, style and 
cachet.  The platinum silver is just a 
stunning color.  The fit & finish are 
superb.  The car just makes you feel

I had new brakes on at 22,000 and that included new front rotors.  Now at 30,000 need new tires again because the tires are very loud and wearing out even though I have had them rotated on a regular basis.  My car is eating tires and picks up road noise.  Also, screws are falling out and the cover to fuses under passenger side glove box fell off and the sun glass holder has been replaced three times and it still won't stay closed. It has a surge in the engine that the dealer can't fix.  The Jaguar decal on the front fell off (came unglued)"

The inside is very basic, the stereo system is horrible, and perhaps I needed to upgrade the stereo system. However, for the amount of the car, one would think the car would have a better sound system. The car has no cool features! Ok, I have memory seats, that's basically it. Nothing about this car feels luxurious! I hope that they do a better job with the redesigned S-Type. It should be more wonderful things about a car other than the exterior appearance, having a great interior, as well as great features makes a car complete.   I cannot believe that the original asking price for this car was $45, 000. There is no way this car was ever worth that amount of money. "

Read hundreds of reviews about the '05 (a great year for this car), and went looking for an ""S Type"". Found one with 30K and was certified. Bought it and never looked back. Ride is smooth and the the pick up with the 6 cyl is like a rocket. City driving I get 22 MPG, and freeway I have gotten between 28 and (I know this may be hard to believe) 32 MPG. I got the 32 MPG going 70 mph on the ""coast"" from LA to San Diego w/no A/C. On a ""Vegas"" trip I was cruising at 85/90 with no problem. This feline can do more if asked to!

I like the car, drives great, is quiet, shifts smoothly, fuel economy is ok, around 21 avg. However, it is in the shop every 2-4 months for either oil leaks, electrical probs (my wife called me this morning saying the temp read out was flashing on and off), transmission fluid leaks, parking break motor going out, etc. and I have only had it 2 years. The dealer is normally good about giving me a loaner, and they always fix it for free, except when the gas tank latch broke. I thought that was bad, but didn't say much.

But the price seemed right, so I bought it.
A week later, the battery was dead, then every week after, the battery would die, faithfully.
Come to find out, it has a parasitic drain that wasn't disclosed to us & I guess this is a huge problem with these cars.
My husband traced it out, & it's the GECM.
I'm disappointed that Jaguar produces such beautiful cars with such ridiculous flaws.

What other performance sedan can you buy used with a 400 hp engine for under $40k? These cars are classics in waiting and represent fantastic bang for your buck."

It is by far the best luxury sports sedan i have owned, being British i wanted a car to match and this is definately above what i expected. The power and equipment are awesome and comes close to the MB BMW M5 equivalent. It maybe doesnt have the toys of the M5 but in comparison it feels bespoke and handmade in many areas and less clinical.

I had a few fault lights come on for no reason but soon learned that the marine sized battery in the trunk was low on power and was ready to be replaced. Now it just WOW"

I flew to Kentucky and bought it, driving 10 hours back to Arkansas that day.  I loved the entire 10 hours and the fuel mileage shocked me with an average of 32 mpg @ 75-80 mph for the trip.  I own a Lincoln LS (nice car too) and I have read several comparisons, but really there is no, the Jaguar exudes style, has a nice ride, shifts smoothly, and the 6 cylinder will surprise you with power.  More back seat and trunk space than the LS too. It gets a lot of jealous looks and a lot of questions.  I am very pleased so far.     "
jaguar,s-type,2005,bill, 07/09/2009,"Wow, what a great car!!",5,"I am a retired car dealer and have owned all kinds of cars. I bought this jag for my wife to drive (4'11"") after buying a jag x type for a customer. This car is the total package. Great mpg, 31 hwy, 24 mixed in town. Besides oil changes and a K&N air filter, I have spent a total of $2.57 for a tail lite bulb in over 20k miles of driving. V6 has plenty of power. No quality issues at all. Solid and safe. One of the greatest interiors of any car I have owned. With this experience, we will probably upgrade to an xj8 at some point. Don't let the quality issues of 20 years ago hold you back from owning one of these great cars.  "
jaguar,s-type,2005,Gruderian, 03/30/2008,Triumph of engineering.,4,"Designed for those who have enough experience with cars to appreciate all that it offers.  Holds the road like glue.  Power is more than enough for todays driving.  Very comfortable for 2 people.  City gas mileage is around 12 to 13 mpg.  Highway 21 to 22 mpg. at around 90 mph with a lot of downshifting to pass.  No problems of any kind so far. Feels like what it is, a luxury sports sedan, no matter where you drive it.  Sound system is as good as I have heard in any car, regardless of price if you set it up right.  This car is for the young at heart who like to experience excitement when they drive.  One test drive will validate what I just said.  Top value for the money.  Highly recommended."

best luxury / performance tradeoff.

Highly recommended"
jaguar,s-type,2005,Loose Cannon Liberal, 09/05/2009,S-Type V8 with Sport Suspension,4,"This is my 3rd S-Type, minor issues with first two, tranny whooping noise which dealer fixed. Excellent car for long drives, avg 28-30 MPG at 75 MPH. The 18"" wheels and Conti Sport Grips are awesome on this V8, the ongoing improvements to the car are very noticeable.  For the money, a certified Jag is a much, much better buy than a Benz, Beemer and Audi, and with the V8 Jag, there is literally no maintenance other than oil changes.  Brakes every 30-40K, I use a shop that works on BMW, Benz, Audi and Jags, they say the long term maintenance on BMW is worst followed by Benz, Audi and the newer Jags. I have been driving CPO's for almost 6 years and love them, my next one will be the XJR."
jaguar,s-type,2005,spinlocker, 04/27/2007,"The big cat, built to cruise, sips gas",4,"30 mpg at 60 mph no a/c. Tires were gone at 50K. Dealer says wear on inside is design so it will handle well, no way to correct. Small leak in coolant system, dealer has tried to correct 3 times, no avail. Passenger window has mind of its own, sometimes won't go up fully, pain in the rain. Dealer has tried to correct twice. Think it will stick this time. Driver seat puts my skinny backside (6', 140#) to sleep after 2 hours, not as comfortable as my Dodge Ram seats, but very smooth quiet ride. Extended warranty has saved my billfold bigtime."
jaguar,s-type,2005,kapriako1, 04/04/2010,2005 Jaguar S-type 3.0 Sport Package,4,"I am amazed that Edmunds has such poor reviews for this car when they did not even test drive it. I would assume since this is the case with the test drive it is going off its older reviews and what the manufacturer says it changed. I love this car, never had a problem with it. I have owned several Jags throughout the years and this car stands out in ride and performance. I am also interested in the misinformation about Ford owning Jag for the XF, Ford no longer controls Jag or Land Rover that was out in 2008. I would say anyone wanting a Stype should buy one no older then 2005 but of course that is what i would say with any car. Make sure its been well maintained and keep it up. "
jaguar,s-type,2005,SGB, 05/28/2005,Outstanding car,5,"I have been extremely impressed by this car (2005 Jaguar S with 4.2 L engine). Beautiful styling inside and out, extremely stable on the road in all kinds of weather including ice and snow, tremendous handling, great acceleration, ergonomically efficient, good gas mileage, great safety features. The seats are firm but comfortable.The dials are easy to read, except in very strong sunlight. I had a 2003 S type before which had problems with the electrical system and noises from the steering column. This 2005 car has been perfect. "
jaguar,s-type,2005,Dave Yeske, 06/03/2006,Love this Jag!,4,"This is my first Jag and I love everything about this car. The styling, the solid feel, and the snappy performance add up to luxury and fun. From the muted growl of the engine to the neck snapping acceleration, you know you're in a Jag. Also confirming this is the full leathter interior, including leather trim on the steering wheel, dash, and doors, and the rich walnut burl trim throughout. "
jaguar,s-type,2005,Joe R, 12/20/2006,Not a main stream car,4,"I love the S type Jaguar. It reminds me of the old Jaguar coupes. I really like that no other car looks like it. This is the 2nd S-type I have owned. The body style is distinctive, the interior elegant, and the handling is terrific. This car is fun to drive!"
jaguar,s-type,2005,JPW, 07/03/2007,S-Type,5,"I just love the car!  I bought the car used and was very pleasantly surprised at all the options.  I traded in a 2006 VW Passat that I did not like anything about. The Jaguar's handling is great and make it a lot of fun to drive.  The added touches of auto sensing windshield wipers, bluetooth, awesome stereo really complete the package.  I was also thrilled to find out that the maintenance and warranty is covered for 4 years/50,000 miles.  The maintenance was a true added bonus!  I've had the car for 4 months and have no complaints."
jaguar,s-type,2005,Barry Lee, 07/30/2005,It is not a BMW or a Mercedes....,3,"Within 3 months this car has been serviced 3 times for a bad transmission that they have not been able to fix. It has a jolt. Car is great but a problem is a problem and at this price I say go elsewhere. I never had this with BMW or Mercedes and I own all three. The dealer has never given me any confidence about repairs, as I think they are doing this often. "
jaguar,s-type,2005,SPG, 01/05/2009,Love My Jag,5,"If you are thinking of purchasing a 2005 Jag, this is the one to own.  I get over 25 mpg city driving, I have never taken it on any trip, so hwy mpg is unknown.  3.5 years of ownership and no problems.  I think I'll own this for a long time!"
jaguar,s-type,2005,harold duke, 05/15/2009,Acceleration problems,5,Occasionally engine surges dangerously to 6K rpm and tries to drive forward while stopped at stoplight with foot on brake and car in drive.  Owners manual suggests putting car in neutral or park when stopping for electric signal.  Jaguar cannot tell me why they make this recommendation.
jaguar,s-type,2005,Bill D., 02/28/2005,Movin' on Up.....,4,First imported luxury sedan.  Captured by the looks and heritage.  Held by the performance and pure enjoyment of the drive.  Wife looks good and feels good in this vehicle.  The 4.2L has enough power to make this car go.  Braking and handling match the power plant.  She gets what she wants and I get to have some fun too!  Black exterior with charcoal gray interior look exceptional when shined up.  Absolutely no regrets.  Like a thoroughbred that wants to run all the time.  I always feel like I have to hold her back.  The car I mean.
jaguar,s-type,2005,Review, 06/10/2005,Steve Bessette,4,The Jaguar S-Type R was a perfect choice for me.  I have two kids and my dad lives with me.  The back seat provides plenty of room for the kids and also for my dad who is 5ft 9in. Me and my wife take turns every morning on who gets to take the Jag to work. The seats are extremely comfortable.  I would recommend this vehicle to people that have small families and a need for performance. 
jaguar,s-type,2005,mechrad, 06/13/2005,used 05 s,4,"Bought the car used 15k miles, former rental car. Very smooth and refined ride, plenty of power.  Beautiful interior. So far after 2 months no problem. good car to buy used, significant depreciation. (although significantly more depreciation to come)"
jaguar,s-type,2005,Steven Mc Cowan, 07/09/2005,Excellent Car,4,This is an excellent car. Well fitted panels and a beautiful interior. The car has surprising power and for a large car is fun to drive. This is a very competent road and luxury car. The seat placement memory is a feature that we particularly enjoy as well. Sales and service follow up have been excellent.

jaguar,s-type,2005,red rabbit, 09/24/2005,Jaguar S-type,4,"The boxy back detracts from its classy design and some of the side lines look like dents from certain angles. I'm also tired of the style of back bumpers in all cars these days since they definitely are not designed for ""bumping"".  The paint dings on the broad canvas of the bumper look like hell.  I knew the mileage per gal. would be lower than the 3.0, but I am surprised it is as low as it is...... 11 mpg in town and 17 mpg on interstates."
jaguar,s-type,2005,Nick Stafford, 12/30/2005,A beautiful experience,5,"I moved from Mercedes to Jaguar and will not go back. I cannot fault the S- Type in any way and it looks beautiful. It will certainly be a classic one day, but for now it has everything for today. The build quality is perfect. The performance is powerful for a large compact. The sat nav and other extras are very practical and integral to the design. Driving it is as smooth and responsive as any Mercedes or BMW I have ever owned. The interior leather and wood trim is classy. Also the reliability data for Jaguar are as good as any other luxury car and I hope this becomes reflected in the resale figures. Full marks Jaguar."
jaguar,s-type,2005,Tom B., 05/20/2006,Classy and Fun,4,"This is my second Jag S-type.  I first bought a pre-owned 200 model.  This time, I bought a new one, with the VDP trim package on it.  It has a ton of power and pick-up, not to mention the smooth ride you expect from a Jaguar and a rear-wheel drive automobile.  The dealership is very attentive to my requests."
jaguar,s-type,2005,Tonnia R. Hawkins, 04/04/2005,mechanical problems,5,"S-Type 2003 Jaguar- I bought this vehicle in November of 2003 and in January the vehicle started giving me problems. I was at the dealership every other week with the same problem. The problem was with the the motor. They had to put in another motor, so obviously I was not happy with buying my new car and the motor goes out. So, after battling back and forth with the dealership, they decided to find another car for me. I was very happy! The car I have now, which is the very same make and model, has done well for me. I haven't had a problem. It runs well, it's pretty and it has a great gas mileage. Most of all, I am very happen with my replacement car. Thanks!"
jaguar,s-type,2005,Royce Moss, 04/27/2005,Nothing like a Jag,5,"My wife suprised me with a beautiful platinum S Type 3.0 with a big red bow -  just like the comercials on TV!   My Jag is perfect. I just love the styling, comfort, ride feel, power and the great sound system. I also love the adoring looks and comments I get from eveyone. As far as I'm concerned it's the perfect car for me.  I now look for excuses to drive. When i'm stuck in traffic on the freeway I don't even care!!"
jaguar,s-type,2005,Jim Stiehl, 06/03/2005,An Audi Alternative,5,"I am a Audi A6 fan but didn't want a third car of the same. The S-Type has been a great alternative. Performance on snow and ice, and the radio is better with the Audi but comfort, style, and how you feel looking over the hood is clearly better with Jag. I sense that people are looking at me when I pull up in this car. Specifically, on comfort, the A6 causes a twinge of back pain after 300 miles but not the Jag. Seats are clearly more comfortable.  Jag has a winner here and I am very pleased with this car."
jaguar,s-type,2005,ThomasE, 01/17/2006,Dream Car,4,"I love this car.  I have only had it for three weeks and it's so much fun to drive I can't stay out of it.  I find excuses to drive somewhere/anywhere.   Best looking car on the road and the performance is outstanding.  Almost perfect blend of luxury and performance.  I picked this car over MB, BMW, Lexus, Audi, and all the Infinitis.  I made the right choice."
jaguar,s-type,2005,NOVA Realtor, 05/13/2006,Love that Jag!,4,This is the third S-type Jag I have owned.  I love the responsiveness and the easy handling.  It is responsive and a fun car.
jaguar,s-type,2005,Tucson driver, 10/15/2006,Good But Could Be Better,4,"I used to drive traditional 2-seat convertible sports cars.  Now as a grown-up I buy 4-door sedans that have potential to be fun to drive, such as a turbo-charged Audi and a 5-series BMW.  The 2005 S-type 4.2 beats those in terms of visual appeal and perceived poshness, but not in actual comfort or roominess and certainly not in  handling. Smooth cruising, yes. Handling, no. The reliability is barely good enough to keep me semi-satisfied.  Same for the amount of interioor rattling. Unless the 2008 S-type handles much better better, I am not going to be seduced by the sexy spy photos, and when my lease ends, I am going to switch. "
jaguar,s-type,2005,TEDSTER, 05/27/2005,2005 VDP DREAM,4,"I have always had some sort of sports sedan.  My wife and I decided to purchase the S-type 4.2 after a fun test drive.  After pricing the car out we found it was actually cheaper to buy the VDP and add the little things like heated seats.  This car is awesome.  It still retains the Jaguar type handling as in the past and is very, very quiet in side.  The car is fun to drive with good performance and pick up.  The only thing I don't really care for is when you are pushing the car at a good click it has a very neutral feeling with a slight understeer.  Other than that it is fantastic.  Great detail inside and out and very comfy.  You can't go wrong with this one."
jaguar,s-type,2005,RWhite, 05/15/2007,Performance for those with patience,4,"Fast, luxurious, comfortable, and very easy to handle. However, 25 months after I bought it new, during which it was in the shop for warranty work for 38 days, I had to trade it for a car I could depend on. When it runs, it is wonderful. However, everything negative about Jaguar's reliability came true. I would only recommend this car to someone who has money, patience, and lives very close to a Jaguar dealer. "
jaguar,s-type,2005,TomH, 02/09/2005,Fun car,4,This car is a joy to drive especally with the adaptive cruise control andnavigation. It makes taking a trip easy.  The car is not perfect and could be improved quite a bit with just a few changes like better drink holders and adding heated steering wheel like mom's XJ8L. Still the car is well equipped. The car handles very well and most times I prefer to take it over the wife's Boxster . While the Boxster is a true sports car the S is very close to as good handling and has better acceleration plus more room. One caution with the standard tires forget even going to get winter tires if the roads have any ice or snow.
jaguar,s-type,2005,Zaiman, 08/06/2010,It's a Wind of Change,4,"Bought the car new for a Birthday present to my dearest wife. I let her choose for any brands and any models (mid size). I took her to all dealers except Al Tayer - Jag sole dealership in UAE. She did not choose any, not until I took her to see this stunning Jag. Had to wait eagerly for a month before finally arrive. I had many luxury brands since 30 years, but this S type was totally the winner of it all. Never had a problem since and enjoy every bit of it. Very good in mileage especially on a long cruise. The V6 3000cc is a bit underpowered but more than enough for my wife to chew. Smooth, luxury and have class. Beats any Mercedes, BMW, Volvo or Audi. No regrets and still loving it till now"
jaguar,s-type,2005,NDG - New Jersey, 01/30/2005,The experience is worth it.,5,This is my second S-Type and the improvements that were made from the 2001 are excellent.  The car is fun to drive and it handles better than any other car I have driven.  I would highly recommend buying this car if you are looking for completely enjoyable experience.
jaguar,s-type,2005,Former Audi/Benz Guy, 02/13/2005,Jag's Made A Believer Of Me,5,"I don't know why some pundits love to find fault with the S-Type.  It boasts the most indulgent design of anything in its class, it (the 4.2 V-8) delivers power with grace & decisiveness, and offers a thrilling drive experience.  I can't find any areas in which Jag has ""cut corners,"" but I would love to see more room in the rear seats and in the trunk.  About the only major addition/change I'd seek is a 4-wheel drive option. Nonetheless, this stylish British import has quickly won my heart ... and for a former Benz & Audi owner like me, that's saying a lot."
jaguar,s-type,2005,steve, 03/17/2005,Super Sedan,4,"This was supposed to be my wife's car, for me to borrow only to drive clients who might not appreciate the ride in my 911. My excuse for getting the ""R"" was that I didn't want to cause an accident if I forgot which car I was in. But on weekends, rather than making her ride in the Porsche, I find myself looking forward to getting this beast out on the freeway. Elegant, fabulous looks, goes like a bat out of hell, stops on a dime, seats are incredibly comfortable, and great agility for a car this size. It's a car in which it's easy to create the illusion that you're a good driver. My wife also finds it easy to drive at her more relaxed pace (not in ""S"" mode). "
jaguar,s-type,2005,Connie Ernst, 03/25/2005,Luxury,5,The jaguar is built so sturdy and elegant. It is fun to drive with great pick-up.  The exterior is strong while the interior is pure luxury. I love the high grade of leather and the smooth ride of the car. I think it is the best styled car on the road.  
jaguar,s-type,2005,Drew, 04/16/2005,Great Car !,5,"Great style, performance and quality. I'm getting 19/30 mpg! Nav works great. Fantastic road car: I just completed a 14 hour non-stop trip with no aches or pains because everything is adjustable to exactly fit each driver. It definitely has that ""English Feel"" to it which is priceless."
jaguar,s-type,2005,Wendy, 05/14/2005,Awesome Jaguar,5,"Rides smooth, I have the new color, Midnight, it looks black in the day and blue in the evening, chrome wheels and mirros, plus love all of the extras, 6 CD player, Navigation, built in phone. I bought the VDP and this one is so beautiful.  Lots of chrome!"
jaguar,s-type,2005,Stuart, 05/30/2005,Truly awesome,4,This is my third Jag ( after 2 VDPs) and also follows 3 S-class MBs and a BMW 540. AWESOME is the only word for the experience. The first touch to the accelerator made my heart beat faster as this absolute masterpiece of automotive engineering roared onto the freeway. Could not imagine needing more power ... arrived at work (an hour plus drive) with no stiffness of the back or legs perhaps due to having been surrounded by the strains of Beethoven on a more than adequate stereo system!!
jaguar,s-type,2005,Danny Rather, 06/11/2005,S Type Jaguar review,4,"Excellent ride, beautiful interior with very good sound system. The most beautiful feature of this car is its exterior classic beauty."

jaguar,s-type,2005,a danna, 07/10/2005,A quality sedan,4,"a great touring sedan.  Have travelled twice across the country in this vehicle and have enjoyed every moment of the drive.  Driver and car become one while on the highway.  The car responds like a feline.  Sleek, swift, agile, responsive.  The only problem i have had is controlling my urge to kick up the speed (already got one speeding ticket putting my kitty through its  paces).  Even at 120, the engine purrs, almost imperceptible.  Classic lines (I consider thye S to be the most beautiful automobile on the road), a great touring car."
jaguar,s-type,2005,David Tan, 01/19/2006,A fierce machine with civilized exterior,5,"I have been driving S Type R. for about a year. The power from its 398 horse engine is ferocious and quick. You have to remind yourself to lighten the gas to avoid speeding. Its price is competitive in the range of performance sedans without sacrificing any amenities and style. Sleek design with 18"" wheels and performance tires. The jewel of the crown is the grill, it's like the chain mail of medieval knight, thus giving a hint of old British trait of lineage and class. I like it more than the BMW 5 Series.        "
jaguar,s-type,2005,Steve, 02/24/2006,Incredible Car and a Great Value,4,"Absolutely love this car!  Off the line performance put to shame my old 2001 996.  Add 25 more HP, more aggressive differential and transmission gearing and you have the equivalent performance of BMW M and MB AMG at tens of thousands of dollars in savings. Ride is great and styling to die for...I get more walk-ups and comments on the Jag than the 911.  The R is a rarety even in San Diego and people notice."
jaguar,s-type,2005,George Knapp, 07/10/2006,Jaguar 2005,4,"Outstanding combination of handling and power, with good fuel economy for an 8 cylinder car.  I am averaging just under 22 mpg combined."

rear.  The rear is beginning to look 
like a ford, not attracting.  The 
interior is what I have to brag about. 
The new wood styling, piping on the 
seats, many new standard options, rack 
and pinion steering which makes a 
tight sport feel to driving, and so 
much more (VDP edition)!!  This car 
makes you really feel like a million 
bucks, as a Jaguar should.  I get an 
adrenaline rush just sitting in it 
with my hands on the wood steering 
wheel.  The driving is so fun it makes 
me want to take a 10-hour road trip!  
The navigation is a great add on, 
really fun and convenient"
jaguar,s-type,2005,Sandi Voigt, 09/25/2004,From BMW to Jaguar,4,"I owned 3 BMW's and wanted a to try a 
Jaguar. I love it so far!It is a very 
nice comfortable car and handles well."

Smooth transmission and incredible 
stereo."
jaguar,s-type,2005,albrtgld, 10/09/2004,Great Car,5,"This is my second Jag. First was a 1959 
3.4 that I drove for 5 years. Never had 
any problems although in those years it 
was supposed to be plagued with 
electrical and other.  In between I 
have had a BMW 528 and BMW 733.  I 
couldn't resist the grill and overall 
shape and size that reminded me of 
my '59. When I took delivery there was 
not 1 item to be fixed. The ride is 
great...all the power, and more, than I 
will ever need. Engine is quiet. 
Interior noise is low. Fit and finish 
is excellent. I don't know where some 
reviewers claim there are a few cheap 
Fordlike parts in the cabin. This Jag 
is a fine automobile and I expect to 
get many enjoyable miles out of it. "
jaguar,s-type,2005,G. Kunz, 10/23/2004,Love my S,5,"For me this car is the best of all 
worlds. It is definitely one of the 
most distinctive, stylish and elegant 
looking vehicles on the road today. It 
is very responsive under any condition 
and can serve as a family car when 
needed with plenty of storage and 
luggage area. It is very luxurious on 
the inside, very comfortable, smooth 
and quiet on the open road as well as 
in-town. Since taking delivery it has 
only been back to the dealer for it's 
10,000 mile service check and oil 
change and once for them to show me how 
to use a function on the radio. It's 
instruments are easy to read, use and 
locate. Based on its competitors its 
gas mileage is as good or better than 
most. Very impressive auto."
jaguar,s-type,2005,wallace robbins, 10/23/2004,"all I expected, and more",4,"looks the best, plenty of power, test 
drove many other imports (mercedes,

the best."
jaguar,s-type,2005,johnny , 10/24/2004,Love the R,5,"Beautiful car.  Has the perfect 
balance of power, handling and ride -- 
where others in this class miss the 
mark, or overcorrect.  The back end, 
down by the exhaust is a negative 
design move.  I actually feel the 
first 2 years of this model (03-04) is 
a more aggressive look (despite what 
many of the published reviews say).  I 
miss the built-in fog lights upfront, 
and the wheels look less sporty than 
before.   "

problem which the dealer fixed which 
was the electronic parking brake module 
went bad.  Other than that it's rides 
great and I have had it in the snow 
once (7inches) and the car performed on 
snow covered roads very well."

jaguar,s-type,2005,Harry Brockington, 01/27/2005,Luxurious and some,4,"I'm a previous owner of a jaguar x-type of 3 yrs. I liked the service I received from my dealer, so I decided to move up to the next model that jaguar offers. I now feel like I'm driving a luxury car. From the smooth ride to the quality build and extra room, I just can't complain about any thing. I'm getting better fuel economy as well. I'ts been 29 days of pure delight. The car has everything I need as far as options goes, cd, nav system, moon roof, 18 inch wheels and some. I'm looking forward to a long rewarding experience with my 05 S-Type 3.0. There may be other vehicles out there that out perform mine, but you can't beat luxury, style and class. "
jaguar,s-type,2005,Gary Kirker, 02/19/2005,Nice car,5,This vehicle is fun to drive and comfortable. Best gas mileage for the power of this car I have ever owned.
jaguar,s-type,2005,PRI, 03/10/2005,The New Jag's Rock !,5,"This is my second Jag. The first being a new 1974 E-Type ""back in the day"". My 4.2 S-Type is fantastic... everything they promised it to be. A real ""head turner"". Adjustable everything, great handling and style, better than advertised gas mileage (19/30). I drive more now (just to get it on the road for that Jaguar experience!)."
jaguar,s-type,2005,Royce Moss, 03/09/2005,My bad cat,5,My platinum S type is a dream car. The ride is smooth and comfortable. The interior is beautiful and functional.The 3.0 engine has plenty power and is very responsive and nimble. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this car. I especially like the adoring comments and looks I get from everyone.
jaguar,s-type,2005,elibruno, 03/15/2005,Dream of an R/Car,5,"You fall in love with the exterior-nothing like a Jag.  But it is the drivability of these autos that shock even the most avid BMW owners ( I have had 13!).  No car has the luxo/performance bang for the buck even close to this R.  Wish Jaguar USA would advertise this way, as one rarely reads anything in comparisons of mid-size euro sport/luxury sedans that includes what might be the best of the breed!!"
jaguar,s-type,2005,Robin Sue, 03/16/2005,Beautiful car!,5,"This is the best car I have ever owned,including 500 series M-B, 700 series BMW, Lexus, as well as Jag XJ.  Great balance of everything I was looking for. Love the look, performance, handling and ride.  The retro styling is perfect."
jaguar,s-type,2005,DW Clark, 03/19/2005,Jag lives up to Powers high reatings,5,I am pleased with this Euro luxury sedan.  I think the recent high Powers ratings are fully justified on the basis of fit and finish and quality.  I like this car much better than the last BMW 530.  It is smoother and I believe the 6 speed transmission is incredible.   I planned to get a v8 but after driving the v6 I decided that the slight performance difference was just not worth $7k more.  The dealer then admitted that they dont really push the v8 as the 3.0 does very well.  At 80 this car is virtually silent on the road.  Great handling that reflects the German heritage and the German test facility.  I am pleased with this car and I believe I got a great deal from a great dealer.
jaguar,s-type,2005,Andrew, 03/19/2005,The S-type R is a great value !!,5,"Love this car, as others have said on recent reviews.  Ride and handling is very good for the incredible performance of this car. Glad it has 5 seats, and is more much unique than the recent M-B options.  An excellent value for the price, and so comfortable and easy to drive.  If you love the racing heritage, and the Jag style and looks of many years ago, this car is perfect.  And since a XKE of the mid-60's probably does not work as a daily driver, this would your best bet in many years.  I like it even more than my previous XJ8 and XK8 (and BMW 7-series), much more unique and handles better than all three.   "
jaguar,s-type,2005,G. Campbell, 03/22/2005,Luxury and Performance Excellence,4,"My Jaguar S was bought last summer and was assembled in the U.K. Every detail was perfect and solid.  It has terrific acceleration and is extremely comfortable for both short and longtrips! I was concerned about Illinois' snowy winter, and purchased snow tires. I was driving in the worst snow storms,and had wonderful and very safe trip seach time. I was always in complete control and felt very safe. My S-8 is an extrodinary car and would buy another in a heartbeat. My service department has been extremely responsive and helpful. I am still discovering wonderful details about this car, and am enjoying driving this fast, responsive, and safe car each day. What a wonderful piece of machinery! "
jaguar,s-type,2005,Isbtown, 03/23/2005,"Nice car, would recommend",4,"Great car, fun to drive.  Horrible in snow, the worst I've ever driven.  straight line power is great.  Stereo system is pathetic for a 60k car.  Why they went with Alpine over bose is anyone's guess.  Bluetooth technology would have been nice.  But the looks, ride, the navigation (which is absolutely top notch), are all great features in a car that can certainly hold it's own against most sports cars these days in a off the line duel."
jaguar,s-type,2005,Theresa Streer, 04/25/2005,S-Type Review,4,"This is one car we may keep for a long time. The design and engineering are timeless. It is amazing on how many second looks this car gets. We feel very comfortable with the free  maintenance program and the dealership we are dealing with makes you really feel that you bought more than just a luxury sedan. We are a little curious why they did not iclude any type of door body side moulding to protect the car for any mishaps that generally will occur at any number of parking lots, which this car will be vulnerable to. "
jaguar,s-type,2005,Karen, 06/18/2005,If you need 4 doors and speed - wow!,4,"I had been missing my fast cars after purchasing a 2001 E320 MBZ, but I needed the room of a sedan.  This car with it's racing suspension, brakes and supercharged engine is definitely it!  I beat our '96 Porsche 911 off the starting line.  It is so responsive and quick and does not hesitate when down shifting the automatic. In corners you can feel it completely set down and hug the road - no fishtailing here. It's a sports car in a sedan body style."
jaguar,s-type,2005,WileCoyote, 12/04/2006,Smooth Rocket,4,"Make no mistake, this car is a worthy adversary for the M5 and E55.  The latter may be faster but the Jaguar gives you a great deal of power for less money.  This car can easily get 25 mpg on the highway - not bad for a supercharged car.  A great car that keeps getting better,"
jaguar,s-type,2005,PHILBERRINGER, 11/15/2007,"Performance, Luxury and Smiles!",4,"In January 2005, I purchased a new fully loaded S-type R to go with my 2003 XKR convertible. I added to both cars a custom Mina chromed high performance exhaust, AEM cool air intake and a smaller supercharger pully. This increased the H.P to over 450 and the total cost was less than $1200.00. Custom made sheep skins were added for extra ride comfort and what a truly great high performance, luxury experience these cars are to drive. My wife and I can hardly wait to drive these cars and when we go out together, we flip a coin to see who gets to drive. Other than regular oil changes and recommended Jaguar maintenance, neither car has ever had one thing wrong with it. We will always buy Jaguars."
jaguar,s-type,2006,michael, 03/14/2009,Still a performer,4,"I've now owned this car for several years and its my third Jag. This car is simply the best I've owned. The looks are still good and save for the easily scraped wheels, it still looks new. The reliability has always been a concern but its never broken down and never not started. The only trips to the shop have been for maintenance and to replace a NAV component (warranty). The brakes are expensive so watch out for that! ($1000.00 for the back)"
jaguar,s-type,2006,forcefed, 05/17/2010,Can't beat it for the money,4,"Amazing power and handling for a car its size, the ability to get 29mpg if you cruise on the hwy. gorgeous good looks. Tight rear seat but that's not why I bought it. Brakes and Tires go fairly fast but the driving experience is well worth it. a few squeaks and rattles showed up and are not covered under warranty after 12k miles. I'm writing this after my car was totaled last week, I walked away with minor cuts and bruises, so I can now say, its a very safe car to be in if things go wrong. Frame was bent and the engine mounts broke but I was able to get out and walk away. Might find myself in another one sooner than later"
jaguar,s-type,2006,Flipside28, 11/20/2015,Better late than never!,5,"I have always loved the S-Type. My lease ended on my Mercedes C 300 and since I don't  drive to my office any longer I decided to buy something that I would really enjoy. I located a 2006 S Type with 47K on the odometer. I did my research and had the car checked out and I have been thrilled with my purchase. It's a nice size; great ride;comfortable and always turns heads. AC needed a boost but other than that its been great. I have it serviced at a Jaguar mechanic when I need oil changes and scheduled maintenance. If you find a good one they are great!

My Jaguar never broke down.
The only money spend is for brakes pads, new tires and oil changes.
I use only Mobil 1 synthetic oil for the oil change.
Next month I¬ím going to have spend some money; for the 100,000 service (New Spark Plugs & Belts).
 This is the best car I owned."

Barry, 02/05/2016,The perfect car for a professional person.,5,"We bought this car after a 3 year return lease off the show room floor thinking it was a new car since the conditions was so good.  My wife drove this car exclusively for 6 years.  Exterior is excellent, interior is excellent, mechanicals are excellent.   Serviced by Exclusive British European in Campbell, CA.  Everything works.  Depreciation of car thru a business has run out is reason for sale.  Time to purchase another car.

jaguar,s-type,2006,jessrayo, 02/27/2011,Amazing car!,5,"I have had my S-Type R for almost 2 years and I'm now putting the experience on the web for others to see.
This is the best car I have ever owned.
I now have 80,000 miles (purchased with 40K).
This car is quiet, comfortable, and amazingly fast.
I was concerned about reliability and maintenance so I specifically looked for a certified pre-owned car.
I have had one trip to the dealership for a warranty claim in the 2 years I have owned the car, I have driven it hard.
I'm kind of a speed junkie and nothing touches this car. I had to get a radar detector to keep from loosing my license.
If you are not looking at the speedo you can't tell how fast you are going."
jaguar,s-type,2006,Joseph - Hbg.,Pa,2006 S type VDP,5,"Purchased in Oct. 2005 - then it had a couple of issues 'others' were reporting - see below for more about this.  This vehicle is a pleasure to drive. Comfortable; controls well laid out. Though minor - having the entertainment controls on the left makes sense since most of us hold the left hand on the wheel.  The Radio volume is a bit low; the subwoofer - though I do NOT like booming sounds in my music - seems to not work much at all. The phone volume....even on its highest volume setting - it is difficult to hear the caller.                                                                                                                                                                                                       May 2018 - still own this vehicle. No problems.  55,200 miles on odometer. 
Odd - a couple of problems many experienced: 1 - hot air from driver left side vent; 2 - rear sun screen - would not raise....these two issues began to function properly all by themselves.
   And - did not know about this feature: do not need to use the brakes whilst driving down hill - it maintains an speed app. 10 MPH. in 'D'.
   Wonder when the battery needs replacement? Still starts the vehicle strongly. The wiper, also original, clean the window cleanly and silently.

jaguar,s-type,2006,Oldengineer, 07/16/2009,Muscle car in a Tuxedo,5,"My car is the VDP model with navigation.  The car is very luxurious both inside and out, yet, handles and runs like a muscle car.  On trips, the fuel economy this car gets, despite having 300 HP on tap, is excellent.  On the interstate, the car is dead quiet, and, very comfortable on long trips.  This is my third Jag, and, by far, the best one yet."
jaguar,s-type,2006,Salvatore Giunta, 07/02/2008,S-Type rules!,5,"When I saw the S-Type for the first time I fell in love with her. So I bought her simply because she looks marvelous and is a Jaguar. Then driving her I found that fantastic stylish was not all, power, ride and comfort are at the top. The best car in the world. "
jaguar,s-type,2006,RCT, 10/11/2009,Love it!,4,Researched a lot of cars in this luxury class but nothing stirred me as much as the Jag.  Having been a Land Rover owner I wasn't put off by the scare stories about reliability problems.  You have to drive these British cars all the time to keep them in good condition.  They don't like to sit for long.  I love the ride in this Jag.  The engine feels plenty powerful to me.  I don't know what all the magazine writers complain about when they talk about not as much power as other luxury sedans.  A few minor cosmetic problems.  The eye glass holder doesn't like to stay shut.  Some bracket holding up a cable under the car broke.  I noticed that the radio volume fluctuated a bit.  Would buy again!
jaguar,s-type,2006,bob8800, 10/28/2006,Great Car,4,"I went from a Lincoln to the Jag and I have been very pleased. Classic appearance, great power and cornering is outstanding. Driver's seat is a bit small for a tall person and five-person capacity is impossible unless they are small people. All in all I am very impressed with a fine automobile."

Sometimes, the temperate display, a/c. fan, etc. flashes on and off endless.
It doesn't seem to effect the a/c but it worries me that it m may be indicating a problem.


A similar display message appears sometimes on the dash regarding cruise control. It says: ""Cruise control not available.""
And then cruise doesn't work.
It seems to fix itself though and although I'm not noticing when, it starts working again.
Any thoughts on either issue?

I absolutely love this car. "
jaguar,s-type,2006,Jeff B, 01/03/2007,This car is the BOMB,4,"I have had many high performance cars in my life, including a 2001 BMW M5, a Porsche GT3 and a Benz E55.  The Jag ""R"" is the best.  The M5 would beat it 0-60 (barely) but jeez, the Jag just FLIES for an automatic.  The transmission is just awesome, the seats are SO much more comfortable than the hard ones in the M5, and the suspension is absolutely just right for me.  Besides the nasty-fast accelleration, the brakes are fantastic. Definitely recommend this wicked, elegant vehicle."
jaguar,s-type,2006,PCardali, 06/01/2006,SUPER JAGUAR!,4,"The 2006 S-Type R is one of the world's most underrated cars. With 400hp the car defines ""Performance Luxury Sedan"". The car's power and handling will amaze you the first time you drive it but the luxury and styling will make you fall in love. Technically the car has everything that any car lover would want: Nav system, Bluetooth compatible, satellite radio without the hassle and annoyance of the German brands. Avoid the iDrive! The car's interior has improved in terms of the quality of the materials compared to earlier models. This is my 2nd STypeR and I love this one even more. Jaguar's STypeR is the automotive equivalent to Clark Kent--underneath the surface lies something SUPER."
jaguar,s-type,2006,Linda S, 07/03/2006,My S type,4,"I wasn't sure which to purchase between MB, BMW and Jag but the interior impressed me the most. In a city where it appears everyone has one, I found the Jag S type makes a nicer statement. The ride is smooth and when accelerating the sports car comes to life unlike the others. I get several compliments on my Radient Red ""S"".  The seats are most comfortable. There is more room and better quality all around compared to the competitors... or am I just prejudiced?"
jaguar,s-type,2006,billk, 10/05/2005,Faster than my old AMG,4,"Once rolling, this car pulls strong in the mid-range and cruises easily up to 130+mph. Nav system slow. Brakes are grabby with tons of black dust all over the wheels.  Most annoying is the wake the dead screeching brakes when brakes get warm and coming to a stop - factory won't warranty. When not moving and turning wheels, power steering jerky like not pumping enough fluid.  Dealer sez this is normal on all Jags - NOT! The warranty people treat you like a Ford owner.   "
jaguar,s-type,2006,Joseph, 05/04/2009,2006 Jaguar S type VDP,4,"I also had that vibrating when speed was between 30000 - 50000 MPH. It was a simple fix, not the roof or ceiling as a previous poster overstated.   I was angry my dealer charged me $100.00 to 'turn on' an electrical feature on an 'option' I paid for. Jaguar headquarters refunded me that $100.00 when I advised them this to be an unfair practice.  The Premium audio system needs to be more powerful not necessarily to be louder but rather to render RICHER sound quality. The Sub Woofer is barely noticeable.  The telephone volume was also too low to hear comfortably - probably associated with my comment above about the stereo.  A/C does not cool the car unless the setting is set at 65 degrees."
jaguar,s-type,2006,surfsidejo, 02/02/2012,I think mine is a lemon,4,"I purchased my 06 S Type last Feb (2011) from a reputable Ford dealer. As soon as I got it home, my husband noticed the door seal was torn big time. I didn't notice when doing the test drive or checking it out, because I was always looking at the interior. Never thought to check areas like that. Anyway, $125.00 later we thought no more problems. 1 week later, husband was washing the car and noticed the lense on one of the fog lights was cracked. Took it for repair, $350.00, we thought we were good to go, spring comes along and we sure can't get cooled off. Everytime I slow down in traffic the AC gets warmer and warmer. Took it to reputable mechanic, $700.00 later we think we are good. Wrong."

Dealership says that all S types do it and it is a design flaw.  My 03 was quiet as a mouse.  Am pretty dissappointed that Jag would admit to a design flaw on a $50K auto.  I have notified Jaguar USA, but they say that no one else has reported this.  The 06 that the dealer loaned us when looking at the moonroof also vibrated.  All in all, great ride but disappointed in the quality."

jaguar,s-type,2006,L. Kraft, 07/01/2006,Gets better all the time,4,"I recently bought the S-Type 3.0 Jaguar. Of all the cars out in carland, this was the only car that stood out. You can't see yourself coming and going in a Jag. And this proved to be very true.  I had my friends guess what type of car I bought. I only told them that it wasn't a German, Italian, Japanese, Swedish or American car. After thinking for awhile, they exclaimed: ""Tell me it's not a Jaguar!"" That's the reaction I have been getting and feeling while driving this terrific automobile. It is one of a kind. I find myself wanting to go out and buy things that I don't need in order just to drive the car. Needless to say, it is a great alternative to the other high-tech cars out there."

jaguar,s-type,2007,Inspector Morse, 04/17/2010,Inspector Morse,5,"We have had this car for three years and it has been fabulous.  We had two prior X-Types which were also excellent.  It is a superb car around town and amazing - AMAZING - on the open road. The handling is superb, the 3 liter is remarkably robust, and it gets better mileage even than the X-Type.  We have always liked the old S cars featured on the BBC 'Inspector Morse' series and this is an elegant modern rendition.   The flowing lines are so pretty even as design trends for most cars have become much more angular the past few years. Still rare and unique enough to turn a lot of heads.  Snow tires are absolutely essential in northern climes.  We will keep this one forever! "
jaguar,s-type,2007,Lee, 06/29/2008,S,4,"Our Jag S-type is definitely one of a kind. Very classy, smooth ride, excellent design. However, we did notice that it needs work on the sunroof area. There's definitely a vibration, a low rattling sounds coming from the ceiling near the sunroof. We took the car back into the dealer in efforts to fix the sounds but it's still there. Maybe I'm a bit more sensitive to sounds than other people but the sound is still there. Hopefully we'll figure out of a way to get rid of the sound. Other than that, an excellent automobile. "
jaguar,s-type,2007,Pete Turner, 04/11/2019,Fifty Years Waiting & Worth It!,5,"It's hard to be objective about a car you've waiting fifty years to own. My first car way back in 1965 was a '58 Jaguar MK II. Sadly, I had to sell it when I went into the service. In 2016, I brought a 2007 S Type in British Racing Green. It""s a daily driver. The Jag is brilliant, realible, luxurious, and in a class by it's self. Twelve years old and still turns heads. I""he had people walk across parking lots to tell me how great the car looks. If you find a low mileage with good maintenance record, buy it!

Subaru, Honda, 100k miles 15 grand plus.
I found a 2002 Jaguar AWD with 29k miles!
10 year old car looks brand new!
Amazing 1/2 the price of them japanese cars!
I drove it home on the curvey mtn roads and that auto/manual tranny, I never had to use the breaks!
Got about 25 mpg fwy, and 19 mountain roads.
I never expected to get an older vehicle that is like new!!! "

The car only had one previous owner and was bought with 78k miles. i was so excited about my new car and i looked great driving it. The car was such a beauty. i later found out that beauty isn't everything when within the first year of owning this vehicle I've had to replace the starter, water pump and transmission. this car has cost me 7k, almost more than it's worth. i guess it's a lesson learned. I'm writing this review to help anyone anyway i can.  "
jaguar,x-type,2002,disguay, 02/07/2012,Amazing car for the price,4,"I have owned my jaguar x-type (sport, lowered, 3.0, manual) for about 8 months and 12k miles. I have never been let down once with this car (even with 120k miles,) although other reviewers will say different. The only trick with this car is that it doesn't like to be abused. If you keep everything maintained via recommendations on forums and not the dealership, everything will continue to run smoothly. "
jaguar,x-type,2002,Zoomer, 09/19/2010,Transmission swap,4,"Those of you who had a automatic transmission swap (out of warranty) had two options, buy a new tranny or a rebuilt unit.  I chose the rebuilt unit ($2700 including labor).  Afterward I looked into the issue and found the rebuilt have enhancements and internal fixes the brand-new ones lack.  So rebuilt is BETTER than new."
jaguar,x-type,2002,Curtis K, 05/16/2010,A victim of misjudging,4,"My X-Type has treated me very well; power and handling are always there when I need it. On the road, I'm confidant of the ability to pass someone even if they try to accelerate to close the gap. Sitting in this car, you really feel at one with the machine as the seat wraps around your body reassuringly, connecting you with the road as the roar of the engine actually sounds like the primal growl of a wild, angry jaguar. The steering wheel allows you to feel your way without becoming disconnected from the road as you do with many luxury cars. We have to remember, to judge this car in the same class as other high-end cars would be unfair. This is an entry level car delivering above par results."
jaguar,x-type,2002,tarrid, 01/02/2014,Great car for the money,4,"Well !!!!! as with every car we review, we will find owners that hate and owners that love ther rides. My Jag is by no means perfect ( NO CAR IS ) but for a car under $5000 Look at what you get. Luxury!!!!!. Do your own oil changes. Your own break job. And if you cant. DONT take it to a dealership. Find a good indi shop. Buy your parts on e-bay. It will cost you just as much to repair as a Ford. (preventative maintanance) is what it is about. You will have a very reliable car with the Jaguar."
jaguar,x-type,2002,TommyE, 04/26/2008,"X-Type is ""All that AND more""",5,"Haven't had mine too long but love it completely.  It replaces a 18 year old Acura. Gets better mileage (avg. 21 city) is absolutely stunning to look at and turns heads everywhere I go.  This isn't just an automobile, its rolling artwork.  When I showed it to my friends the most heard thing they say is, ""Oh my god, its so beautiful!""  This thing feeds my ego quite nicely.  I can't image any other car making me happier. I am very very satisfed."
jaguar,x-type,2002,alex sholom, 04/19/2010,Car shakes and wont accelerate over 40,5,I have a jaguar X type 2.5 and when i would accelerate the car would shake and slow down as if running out of fuel. I changed the fuel filter but that didn't solve it even though the fuel filter was almost clogged. I tried changing sensors and thought it was the transmission but the reason was when i was washing the engine water got into the spark plugs and was blocking off the spark. I blew out all the water with an air compressor then put in the spark plugs and it works like a charm ever since. hopefully this can be helpful to somebody.
jaguar,x-type,2002,ivanrothschild, 12/22/2010,Decent Entry Level Luxury Car,4,"I've had my X-Type for two years. It handles well. Not quick when accelerating until you get over 2500rpms. Handles fantastic in snow. I've had to rebuild one of the brake calipers. Every imaginable lightbulb has gone out (replaced easily and cheaply). Overall it is reliable, but not super comfortable on long trips. Gas mileage is so-so. It's a head-turner, but I quickly realized I'd like a car that rides smoother and handles better. Suspension feels stiff. Great deal for the money though minus some minor annoyances at times. When it's freshly cleaned, I do sit up straighter in my seat...It's a Jag, hardly anyone has one! Fit for a queen, affordable (if you buy used) for everyone."
jaguar,x-type,2002,Ed, 01/08/2007,The worst car I've ever owned,2,My car loves to spend time getting service.  It's been at the dealer for service 10 months of the 48 months I've owned the car.  I can't remember the many new parts it has but you can say they have rebuilt the thing.  Nobody can deny is beautiful but is a piece of junk. 
jaguar,x-type,2002,AC, 12/29/2009,Wow GREAT Performance for 2.5S,4,I purchased the jag with 56k mi about 1 1/2 yr ago and I was blown away on how well the performance of this car it sounds like an American muscle car when I punch it to pass uphill or entering freeway. It's fast for a V6 and it does roar. Now I'm hooked on jag! The only thing is when I needed oil pan gasket fix it's hard to get into the pan without taking apart everything from the bottom and labor was expensive plus parts $1000. When I purchased it I did not know that it was an AWD and my gas mileage is poor in mix driving but you can get good mileage on the freeway.

jaguar,x-type,2002,Richard Bobo, 12/14/2005,Mechanically a disgrace!,3,I have owned this car for 7 months. It went back to the shop under warranty 5 times in less than two months. The transmission still shifts ruff after having the control module reset twice. I have had to replace the drive shaft at an expense of $883.00 and now I have to have the power steering hose replaced at a cost of $489.00. The warranty ran out last month and these expenses have been incurred within less than a month of that!!!!   What a piece of junk!!!! Oh I forgot that the vent covers on top of the dash pop up when the temp outside changes and I finally supper glued them down. I will not buy another.
jaguar,x-type,2002,X X-Type, 03/08/2004,Disappointed,2,"Trouble from the start. I have never 
taken a trip without visiting a Jaguar 
Dealer for repairs. My current dealer 
has tried to fix all the problems, but 
they seem to be totally overwhelmed 
with all the problems. They now refuse 
to even try to repair. The car is 
still under warrenty, but Jaguar has 
walked away.I talked to the dealer 
about other models, but they say they 
are even less reliable. Bad News!!!!"
jaguar,x-type,2002,Tom, 10/03/2006,Outstanding value when purchased used,4,"I did a lot of research before deciding on this car, a mint 2002 X-Type 2.5 Automatic in Carnival Red. I had wanted an entry-luxury car to handle my long daily commute and I looked at BMW, Mercedes, Saab, Infiniti, etc. I was drawn to this car's great looks and the comments I get from others confirm that. I knew of Jaguar's dubious history of poor reliability and also read many of the lukewarm and even negative reviews. I am very pleased with this car. It is an amazing value on the used market. I can understand that some who bought new may be a little underwhelmed because of the price. But at the price I paid this car is a steal. I was able to add an extended warranty."
jaguar,x-type,2002,Hate It!!!!, 03/15/2010,Never again will I buy another Jaguar,2,"I will never buy another Jaguar.  I have owned my car for 3 years and have had it in the shop for countless things (in fact, it needs to be taken in again but I just don't care anymore).  Thank God the dealership would not sell it to me without an extended warranty otherwise I would be in BIG trouble.  I can't even begin to tell you about all the issues with it.  And, to make matters worse, I am trying to trade it in for a newer, more reliable vehicle and I have been the laughing stock of every dealership I have been to.  I am about $10,000 upside down in it which is making negotiations very difficult.  I will never, ever recommend one of these cars.  They are crap."

great sound system, good visability,

Bad Points:  Many rattles and squeeks, 
very loud road and wind noise, breaks

My wife and baby have been stranded 3 times because the car wouldn't start it would say security enabled and the only way to reset it is at the dealership. which is 100 miles from where we live. When i had problems with the brakes it went on for 3 months they had to get the engineers who designed the brakes and fly them into the dealership to finally fix them. Bottom line it's junk"

I wouldn't dare press mine all the way down as the front end jumps up in the air-There is too much power, so be careful, it can get away from you. Beautiful paint (Mine is a champaign color). It's an Arizona car. It's got the injection system of the new corvettes, it's low to the ground, sleek and stylish.

It's true that the X Type is not a BMW

it's minor comparative faults but it's 
biggest fault is a driver who has 
nothing to do but compare it to 
something else. The interior is 
not ""Spartan,"" it is very 
conservatively sleek and pleasing. The 
rear seat room is a bit cramped but 
this is not a family vehicle or a

To top it off, the car loses its value faster than anything Ive seen on this planet. All European cars are finicky, its really hit or miss. If you want these cars, get a warranty."

of last month.  So far, it seems to be 
quite satisfing.  My only complaint is 
the sloppy transmission.  I had a 1998 
Jaguar XJ8 (the big 4-door model), and 
it had the dame tansmission problem.  
Overlooking that fact however, the car 
seems to drive and run beautifully. 
Last night, however, something rather 
strange occured.  When I got in to the 
car, I wanted to put up the sunroof, 
and it was going all haywire...The part 
of the button to move it back wouldn't 
work, and the up part was all confused, 
moving back and fourth...today its 
working fine.  Strange.  Overall, 
though, a great effort from Jag."

After two BMWs, this car rides as well 
if not better than my former 5 and 3 
series cars.  It handles great and it 
clearly gets the looks and great 
comments that BMW never did.  Most 
importantly, in the first 100 miles of

It responded perfectly.  So far, I 
couldn't be happier.  It's a joy to

BMW, the Acura, the Benz, the Audi, the 
Cadillac CTS, the Saab. But none of 
them as great as the X-type. I thought 
that the BMW was too small, the Acura 
was just ok, the Benz was pathetic and 
the Saab was too expensive. The guy at 
the Cadillac dealership was one with 
really bad attitude, while the only 
problem with the Audi was it was 
smaller. I settled on the Jag because 
of it offering most of the features 
that I wanted. Boy! It drives like a 
dream. I really don't know what the 
editorial reviewer was thinking, but 
this car definitely rates in the high 
9s."
jaguar,x-type,2002,fs, 04/12/2002,Fun Jag,4,"My experience with my x-type started 
out poor with my Jag locked away in 
the shop for two weeks because of 
sound coming from Drive shaft.
What we all found out was the prop 
shaft has bearings that were exposed 
to salt air which caused the vechile 
to make a loud noise when reving about 
2500 RPM in cold weather.
The problem was fixed and the car 
rides great,it has a growl with the 
dual exhaust,but the car is quick.

The exterior look it great,and it 
rides like a true sports car with the 
AWD their is a degree of confidence.

I would recommend the all weather 
package and Premium package for those 
areas that need it.

I love driving the car and would buy 
it again."

I bought the non sport version, 5 
speed, it is  a lot of fun to drive and 
significantly more comfortable. This 
car is awesome. The car handles great 
through backroads and tight turns and 
did great in the snow storms. A friend 
who has taken high speed driving and 
handling courses for work drove it and 
couldn't believe the grip the AWD had 
on the road at the speeds we cornered. 
Over all, I'm very satisfied."

Until the big one happen. 2 1/2 years later after I purchased my car I brought it in because of rust that I found along the rocker panel on both sides of the car. 1 month later the dealer came back to me saying that the car was not repairable. Jaguar purchased back the car from me. The dealer told me that this was a design problem and it was fixed in later year models. 2004 or newer. I purchased a 2005 3.0 x-type bacause of the after market accessories that I had on my 02. 
jaguar,x-type,2002,Meow Mix, 04/18/2002,It's Nice Being the New Kid on the Block,4,"I bought my X-Type 3.0 Sport 2/02 and 
had problems including driveshaft 
whining, leaky washers, and ""rocking"" 
seats.  New vehicles regardless of 
manufacturer often have minor hiccups 
within the first couple thousand 
miles.  What it boils down to is your 
local dealer and their service 
department.  Mine fixed all problems 
quickly the first time. I would rather 
be driving a car that is different and 
in my opinion, more fun, than all those 
Audi's and BMW's out there.  I've 
ridden in plenty A4's, S4's, A6's and 3 
series, and although they are 
still ""fun"", the novelty just isn't 
there. BTW, my friend has burned 2 
turbo's on his S4 and another's new A4 
3.0 bounces like a pogo stick on the 
freeway."
jaguar,x-type,2002,tgapoz, 08/24/2008,Electrical problems like any other Ford.,4,"This has been a great vehicle however maintenance is costly. Expect several hundred dollars for the simplest of repairs. My particular annoyance deals with electrical. Why would someone tie in the moon roof, interior lights and blower into one module. $300 to trace the problem and $500 to replace module. I refuse to replace and let this issue remind me to never buy a Ford product again. The work around was to unplug the module but that means no interior lights or moon roof. Oddly enough the blower worked. $1300 for brakes, $700 for an oil pan leak."

sport sedans...but the X-type just 
grabbed my eye.  I love it's looks, 
it's exceptional.  I have many complete 
strangers tell me it's a beautiful 
car.   I love to drive it, the 5 speed 
manual is great fun.  The alpine stereo 
is excellent.  I love the interior 
styling and the way it handles on the 
road especially when revving the engine 
at 4000 to 6500 RPM's"
jaguar,x-type,2002,automan, 04/25/2002,I love this Cat and I am a dog man,5,"This car is simply excellent.  It looks 
great, drives like a dream and is 
comfortable as well.  The all wheel 
drive and optional sports shift (push a 
button) let you play formula 1 or old 
foggie driving.  As the Army would say, 
be all you can be and drive this cat."
jaguar,x-type,2002,t. j. fields, 05/02/2002,FUN,4,"I wanted a 5 speed car and when I took 
it for a test drive I fell in love with 
it.  The all wheel drive feature makes 
it handle so well, rather like the Audi 
4 (another choice). The price is great, 
although with a sun roof and 6 CD 
player it came to $37,500.
The front view is beautiful, the back 
not so bad but the side view is pure 
Ford Taurus...but I live with it for 
the price and the way it drives.
I see very few where I live but I think 
it is a little low end for the 
neighborhood...the S is getting popular 
here as well as the big ones.

jaguar,x-type,2002,Style, not substance,Do you like your wallet?,3,"Then look elsewhere.  Jaguar entices 
people with a low initial MSRP, but add 
anything that you feel a Jaguar should 
have and your in the high 30's.  
Interior is beautiful, probably finest 
in class.  2.5 engine is lacking but 
not abysmal.  Ride is pleasant.  Even 
if your budget allows for a fully 
loaded car, you're better off with a 
German nameplate if such things appeal 
to you, which it does just about 
everyone.  I understand how the style 
convinces the buyer, but the 
reliability on long commutes would 
worry me a great deal.  BMW does a much 
better job with value and quality.  
Just my impression based on extensive 
research and test drive."

is great.  Love the power and handling 
of the 3 liter, 5 speed.  Seats very 
comfortable (I have lower back problems 
and can ride long periods in comfort).  
Ours is Phoenix red- get lots of looks 
and compliments.  Test drove BMW 3 and 
5 series, Volvo s60 and Jag was best.  
Exterior and interior are beatiful.  
Birds eye maple dash, sunroof and 
stereo controls on steering wheel are 
great.  Love to see occasional poor 
reviews-keep this jewel a secret and 
not see a Jag at every light-like a 
BMW."

jaguar,x-type,2002,ccantrell, 05/25/2002,Be Warned,3,"Great Looks. If only they could make a 
car worth the $$. My car has been in 
the shop more than 45 days total. My 
MAIN complaint about the car is the 
amount of road noise and rattling 
(doors & dash).  They have a design 
problem with the front heater vents; 
they pop-up and will not stay in place. 
The other problems I have had with our 
car is gas tank issue (service 
advisory), gas gauge, manual trans 
issues when cold, drivers interior door 
(re-design on clips).  My 
recommendation is DON'T buy.  Better 
quality available for the same price.  
If you want the cat on the hood, look 
into the S-Type or higher. I feel like 
we paid $35,000 for a YUGO most days."

as well as my Jag X-Type. Sleek and 
sexy that I have people staring at her 
in awe. With All Wheel Drive it corners 
like it is on rails. I have wanted a 
Jaguar my whole life and this one was 
affordable for the middle class person 
looking for luxury and comfort.  I 
would like to get one thing straight, 
Jaguar's are not FORD's. My husband and 
I have been to England and believe me 
these cars are still made there.  The 
only differance is FORD now is the 
mangement and the fact that they have 
some English class now.  The other 
imports in that price range better 
worry. She is in a class all of her own."
jaguar,x-type,2002,Kurt-SpringTx, 05/29/2002,What is Edmunds Thinking,5,"You guys at Edmunds need to get 
together and reevalute this sexy, sleek 
car.  What were you thinking?  She is 
at least a 8.  You really don't know 
what you are missing until you have 
driven her.  BMW's and Mercedes should 
watch out.  The Cat's are Roaring."
jaguar,x-type,2002,MarkT, 05/29/2002,2002 Jag X-Type wows young family,4,"My wife and i really enjoy our Jag X-
Type 3.0. It is very secure in 
cornering. Accelerration is relaxed at 
low speeds but spirited when you are on 
the highway. The leather and real wood 
make the interior very comforting. The 
seats hold up to long trips. The ride 
is stiff but bumps are muted 
effectively by the exceptional 
suspension. The exterior styling is the 
best in class by far. I would recommend 
it to anyone who is shopping for a 
luxury car 
with tasteful styling and solid 
performance. Just remember to not place 
high value on interior gadgets because 
they are few in this car but it does 
make up for it with AWD and excellent 
engineering."
jaguar,x-type,2002,idriveajag, 05/31/2002,Beyond my Expectations!,4,"I have now owned this car for 3 weeks. 
I was apprehensive while awaiting 
delivery. All I can say is that I love 
it more every day. It has awesome power 
and handling. Mine was not cheap as it 
is the Sport with many options, but I 
feel that for the money it is the 
classiest car on the road. BMW and Benz 
make great cars too, but there are way 
too many of them on the road. Elegance 
and distinction were always the 
hallmark of Jaguar and the tradition 
continues with the X-type."
jaguar,x-type,2002,PLEASE READ THIS!!!!, 06/01/2002,DONT BELIEVE,5,"I was shocked to read the review 
entitled, ""Do you like your wallet? By 
Style, not substance.""

Anyone who knows their Jags knows that 
Ford bought Jaguar around 1985, and 
ever since that, the cars have been 
extremely reliable. Therefore, I do not 
understand their ""but the reliability 
on long commutes would worry me a great 
deal."" Also, they say BMW is a much 
better choice, which is by opinion 
only. For anyone considering 
this car, or just bought it, you chose 
wisely. I am very pleased; my last car 
was an XJ Vanden Plas Sedan. This car 
is much more entertaining to drive, and 
not too ""starched."" Nevertheless, this 
is a JAGUAR."
jaguar,x-type,2002,Gar, 06/07/2002,Goodbye to my SUV,4,"I've been driving my new 2.5 X type 
Jag. for about a week. It is hard to 
believe you get this much bang for your 
buck. It was about the same MSRP as my 
Nissan Pathfinder, which I thought was 
a great car too, but this is real 
comfort. The inclusion of scheduled 
maintainance, road service and a loaner 
is the cherry on top of the ice cream. 
It is truly a luxery car and I like it 
better than my Mercedes"
jaguar,x-type,2002,buckeyebrit, 11/27/2009,Special car,4,"This was my 1st Jaguar purchase in the States after having 2 UK models back in Blighty before emigrating to the US. I was dubious about buying a US specification car after enjoying a X- type & a S-type over the pond. My concerns were soon put to bed after I took the car for a test drive. I loved it, despite the steering wheel being on the wrong side. When you sit behind the wheel of a Jag, you know you're sat in a car that all the ""others"" aspire to match! My wife had been ""Japanese cars only"" until she drove the Jag. Now she won't even look at anything else. It handles like a sports car, the AWD is awesome, the quality and driving experience are unmatched from anything else out there!"
jaguar,x-type,2002,Mr Mike, 06/19/2002,Lemon,3,"I bought a new X-Type in Jan 02. After 
just one day I had to return the car 
because of a faulty drive shaft. New 
one was faulty and so on. After 4 
replacements it work. Oh, did I mention 
that the car had a missing Head light 
when I picked it up.

Next problem the heating system stopped 
working. Sun roof needs re-cycling from 
time to time. Now the car is back with 
the Dealership to try and sort out a 
bad noise from the roof.

Worse car I've ever bought. I did 
suggest to the Dealership that they 
should replace the car after one week 
which they agreed too if I bought out 
the lease for $16,000!

Avoid this car and Dealership."

attitude of the salesperson.  I called 
the Jaguar Dealership in Miami and 
worked out a deal over the phone for a

in my 2002 VW Beetle turbo with 800

around Audi A4Quattro, BMW 325XI, and X-
type.  The Jag dealer was the most 
friendly.  The BMW dealer would give us 
the option to purchase the right to 
order our new BMW sometime this fall.  
The X-Type was competetive in all 
respects to the Audi and BMW.  In fact, 
specs for Jag are superior.  The 
warranty, free maintaince for 
48mos/50K, and our dealer's free loaner 
car made the purchase a no brainer.  
Great little car with all the features 
to be superior to BMW and Audi."

rich people because of past models and 
prices - this vehicle is for you. I 
drove BMW, Volvo, A4, C230, IS300 - 
there was no issue once I saw, 
researched and drove a x-type Jag. I 
ordered the car in June 2001, took 
delivery in Sept. 2001. I couldn't be 
happier. Excellenct ext/int styling, 
awesome grip on the turns and more. I 
recommend the upgrade of the alpine 
stereo a must for music lovers. Don't 
worry about the reliablilty concerns 
other people may say about Jag. You 
can't lose if your jag needs work, 
they lend you another - Enjoy the ride"

base engine gives more performance 
than one can truly appreciate in 
normal situations?  A fantastic car in 
all respects... if you are looking at 
this car, spring for premium and sport 
packages... AWD and sport mode are 
incredible combination... Took a trip 
on back roads through coast range in 
NW Oregon... like riding on rails

You can corner at high rates of speed 
without a problem.  I've never 
experienced engine braking like this 
car.  The only real negative is that 
the 2.5 L is fairly sluggish in 
traffic.  It could definetely use more 
pep.  the gas mileage is around 21 
mpg.  Not bad."

almost a 10 year relationship with local
dealer, I was told no deals and the car

about the I35. On my way home I pulled
into the Jag dealer looking for a
pre-owned Jag. Drove out in a '03
X-Type. With the premium pkg, DSC, and 
 Alpine, it was LESS than the offer on
the G35. Though the X is not the fastest
off the line, it passes without fail.

build quality, no defects found yet 
(and I'm very picky), and wonderful

It really stands out in a crowded 
market segment, and is not a ""Me too"" 
kind of car.

I compared this car to many others, but 
none could compare in terms of 
functionality (AWD), style, standard 
equipment (connolly leather, maple wood 
trim), and price.

Dealer treatment has been absolutely 
1st rate.  You would think I had paid 
$100K for the vehicle.

Concerned about what you've heard about

jaguar,x-type,2002,stlouisjag, 11/28/2002,It's fun..............now,4,"As I write this review I finally have 
my car back from 2 weeks in the shop.  
This was my fourth visit lasting 2 or 
more days over the past 6 months.  
Clearly disappointing and 
unacceptable.  Most people I know 
questioned my decision to buy a jag 
based on quality but I told them that 
was the ""old Jaguar"".  

This story seems to have a HAPPY 
ENDING....

When I drove my car home last night 
(after having a new transmission 
computer installed?) I honestly thought 
I was driving a completely different 
vehicle.  It was quiet, responsive, 
shifting smooth as silk, in short... A 
BLAST TO DRIVE!"

SOMEONE LIVING IN THE NORTHEAST OR SNOW 
BELTS ***** All Wheel Drive is just 
awesome.  Great control in first few 
snow storms.  2.5 6 cyl performs pretty 
much the way it should w/hp.  This 
vehicle is equipped with all premium & 
sport packages.  This loads the JAG 
right up.  No squeeks or rattles.  Fit 
& finish is great.  Trunk is usable 
especially with folding rear seats.  
Leather heated seats are superb.  
Automatic transmission shifts smooth.  
Traction/stability control adds to 
vehicle alot.  I would highly 
recommend.  Great road feel.  This JAG 
performs for the money."

I decided to try out the ('03 2.5, 
auto) X-Type, based on a friend's 
comments of his 2002 model. WOW! What a 
fun (not so little) car.  Insurance 
costs went DOWN! I love the handling 
with the AWD - the Benz would just sit 
and spin when pulling away from a stop 
light in wet conditions. This car just 
wants to go! Summary: Love It!"

smooth power. Manual transmission works perfectly. Spacious,
very comfortable interior. Huge trunk. Great audio.
Complaints about being ""spartan"" ""plastic"" are ludicrous (less so 
than Mercedes or BMWs). Classic, beautifully 
designed car. Dealership service excellent, first-rate. Best experience 
ever buying a car."

to drive and great styling mane for a 
great vehicle. Basicly I have all os

comes in very handy and almost always 
works extremely well."

styling to the leather interior, this 
is far better than the BMW 3 or the MB 
C Class.  The trunk space is awesome.  

Drove the sport package and did not 
purchase it as it seemed to make a lot 
of noise.  The non-sport package is 
just fine.  The AWD is spectacular.

Edmunds reviewers need to look at the 
posts to see how happy people really 
are with this vehicle.

Did I mention the head-turns of other 
drivers when they see the styling?"
jaguar,x-type,2002,choose2run, 03/03/2002,Love My Jaguar,4,"X-Type, 3.0, X1 Premium, Alpine Stereo.
I have had my Jaguar for two weeks now and have had nothing but great experiences. Initially I was reluctant to purchase the X-Type because of the negative comments but I am glad I did. It accelerates well, corners tightly, and definately catches everyone's attention.  I was considering the Audi A6, Volvo S60, and Saab 9-5 which were all very nice, but had to go with the Jaguar for it's individuality."
jaguar,x-type,2002,ckshep, 07/09/2003,Excellent experience overall,4,"I've owned my 2002 over a year now.  
Overall it's been excellent, improving 
with age, and very solid on the road.  
A few minor issues that were cleared up 
in no time at the dealer, just trivial 
things as with any new car.  Car is 
wonderful to drive, with the 5 spd 
manual and sport package, has plenty of 
power for everyday use and feels very 
solid.  Wonderful for long distance 
trips.  Gas mileage has gotten way 
better over time, from the low 20s to 
the high 20s by now, almost 30.  The 
upgraded audio package is great.  
Overall ownership has been wonderful."
jaguar,x-type,2002,Bloyd, 07/25/2003,2002 Jaguar X-Type,5,"  I love the exterior styling, the 
performance and the comfort.  The 
navigation system is a real winner for 
guiding you to your destination as 
well as finding cafe, hotels, etc., 
along the way.  The xenon headlamps, 
promimity waring system, and rain 
sensing wipers are nice touches.  The 
Alpine stero can simply blow you away.
  Although I have dual bike racks for 
my X-Type (evidently rare for 
Jaguars), I've never used them.
  The only negative has been a couple 
of logic chips that have had to be re-
programmed.  And the navigation system 
bumps the exterior temperature LCD to 
a place that's difficult to read.
  The Jaguar service has been 
fantastic."
jaguar,x-type,2002,mattklu, 07/30/2003,A lot of car and style for the price,4,"I looked at the C class Mercedes, the 
Audi A4, and the BMW 3 series and for 
the price the X type is by far the best 
value.  Throw in all-wheel drive and it 
was a done deal.

The car looks great, handles well, has 
excellent braking and rides very smooth 
while touring on the highway. "

it all the time....""They are not well 
built cars, it is just a glamorized 
Taurus, and it must be pretty stripped 
down for that price.""  The truth is the 
car is absolutely beautiful and a 
pleasure to drive.  I have had my car 
for 2 years now and nothing has gone 
wrong.  The car has only been to the 
shop for its scheduled services and 
with the free maintenance plan, I 
haven't had to pay for anything other 
than gas.  Drive the car, buy the car.  
You will be glad you did."
jaguar,x-type,2002,RJD, 08/30/2003,Quite worth a test drive !!!!!!!! ;),4,"My 2002 X-type is off white/creme.  
People comment on it every time I drive 
it.  It is the 2.5 with a 5 speed.  
Only option was the indash cd player.  
I purchased the car for under $29k.  
I'm not into gadgets.  I wanted a 
drivers car.  This car is most 
certainly in the top for 
handling/mileage/aesthetics.  Nothing 
else looks like it on the road but 
other jags.  Interior is quite nice.  I 
added a full wood trim kit, which 
really improved the feel inside.  
Beautiful. AWD in my state is 
essential. The engine is designed to 
run at high RPM'S.  It is quite 
enjoyable to rev this car to 6000k 
RPM.very cool."
jaguar,x-type,2002,sjp1, 09/16/2003,Finally a Jag for the Snow belt,5,"For years I have driven Jaguars and 
Have dreaded winter. Despite the low 
gear lock out I still had difficulties 
in winter. When I brought my last Jag 
in for routine service, my sales 
person, knowing where I live showed me 
a x type and asked me if I would like 
to try it out. When we came back I did 
not want to give back the keys.It has 
all the pleasures of  the other 
models,but also has the handling for 
my climate in Northern New York, where 
snow can last in to mid may. I had 
some unusual things happen, a stress 
crack in the windscreen, and I needed 
a new program chip for my navigation 
system. All fixed and in a timely 
manor,Thank you Jaguar."
jaguar,x-type,2002,Robert Dahowski, 08/08/2003,Never Buy the First Year,2,"The car is a lemon.  You should never

in the shop.

the get go."

it had spent almost a month out of 12

engine failed)."

owned the Jaguar X-Type, to 
say ""Pleasantly surprised"" would be my 
first reaction.
  Coming from the Honda Accord, I would 
say it would be the same as coming from 
a Cadilliac to a Rolls Royce.
  Being some what of a car buff, I knew 
of the troubles Jaguar had had and 
faced in the past.
  The car is luxurious yet functional.A 
smooth ride but, can be knocked around 
without you feeling it.
  I can't wait for the first Snow fall, 
to experience the AWD in a luxury 
automobile."
jaguar,x-type,2002,Ted Watson, 03/29/2005,Worst Car I've Ever Owned,2,"I purchased this car new in August of '02.  The first week set the tone - it went back to the shop for a leaky oil cooler.  Since then it has been in the shop 20+ times for a total of months and months.  It the last year alone it has stranded me three times.  You name it, its had it repaired/replaced - oil leaks (still), new front and rear suspension, radio, gauges replaced, computers, xeon headlights, door panels, cooling hoses, door latches (over and over), rattles,squeaks, etc, etc.  My warranty is up in 4K miles, so I'm car shopping.  However, I will never, ever, buy another Jaguar!!!!!"
jaguar,x-type,2002,jgwebwoman, 10/09/2003,Fun Car but has some problems,4,"I love driving this car! However, when 
we purchased our car (used) the check 
engine light came on in the first few 
days.  Over the course of 6 weeks the 
light went on and off and the service 
station didn't know why and could only 
reset it. Also, the driver side door 
handle is poorly designed.  If you 
don't lift up on it just right it won't 
release the latch so you can open the 
door.  It is very frustrating.  Also 
the boot open indicator occasionally 
comes on when driving down the highway, 
but goes back off shortly.  Overall 
though I'm extremely pleased with the 
car and still feel happy every time I 
get in to start her up!"
jaguar,x-type,2002,great kitty, 11/04/2003,The Awesome Cat,5,"Jaguar did it right. In a pool full of 
Mercedes and BMWs, Jaguar really stands 
out as one of most gorgeous cars on the 
road today. I have driven Mercedes and 
BMW and nothing feels like a Jaguar. I 
was never able to afford a Jaguar until 
now, and I Love it so much. The old 
rumor of Jaguars always being in the 
shop is not true now. The car rides 
great, handles wonderful and is simply 
a delight to look at the interior. the 
five speed transmission is also great."
jaguar,x-type,2002,gar, 11/05/2003,It's the little things!,4,"Over all it's a good car but it's the 
little things that bug me. After a 
recall service there was a rattle in 
the dash. Serviced it twice and it wont 
go away. Same thing with wheel noise. 
Sounds like backing plattes for brakes. 
The chrome door handles here in sunny 
Florida get too hot after a few 
hours in the sun. Oh, please get rid of 
the sliding arm rest. I also have 
trouble reading the odometer in bright 
sun behind the car. Even in normal 
circumstances I find it hard to read 
when wearing sun glasses, which is 
most of the time in S. Florida. I'd 
trade it in over these annoying little 
things but the resale is not in favor 
of that move."

jaguar,x-type,2002,Dee, 08/14/2005,Love this car,5,"I fell in love with this car the first time I saw it. Bought it the following week. I am sure that the dealer knew what he was doing as he gave me the keys and said...take it for a drive, you know the area, right?.....wow, I loved the way it drove, looked, and the way I felt in it. I especially liked that it is a manual transmission. I have had it a year and a half now, and haven't had anything go wrong. I go in for regular tune- ups, and oil changes according to scheadule, as I drive about a 100 miles a day. I get really good gas milege 29 mpg, probably because of the manual. Have 84000 miles on it now and it drives like a dream. I would buy another Jag in a heartbeat. It is great!"

At the 50,000 mile make a leak in the 
drive train sent oil everyware under 
the car and on to the exast system. The 
repair was $1000 and the cost of the 
rental car $250.00. Jag corperate 
said ""tough break"" ""Deal with it""
Needless to say... I am NOT very happy"
jaguar,x-type,2002,eburford, 01/24/2004,Baby Jag Thrill to Drive,5,"This JAG 3.0L is a thrill to drive.  
AWD provides safety, and the 3.0L 
automatic provides more than enough 
power.  While driving at VERY high 
speed, everyone in the car feels very 
SAFE.  I'd recommend the 3.0L, not the 
2.5L.  Stick with the auto 
transmission and enjoy the J-gate 
automatic to control the gears, 
particularly when slowing down for 
freeway offramps.  I love this car."

I never had 1 problem getting around

at only 9,000 miles, many others had
same experience.  Should have been
recalled but too many cars were
affected, Ford was unwilling to spend
the bucks.

I have owned this car 1 week and it is great! I do know the transmission takes some getting used to but if you can get used to it, this car is very nice. I loved my LS but let me tell you this car is all its cracked out to be and more!  I love it and recommend anyone who really enjoys a luxury sports sedan to give it a try.  Yes its not a perfect 10 but it's very darn close. My desciption ""FUN AND CLASSY""!!! Very nice car and the AWD is just a bonus. "

I had replaced three of them before deciding to get aftermarked Jag 16"" rims installed.  Lost some performance but I can at least hit a pothole without having to buy another $500-$600 wheel"

I am, however, disappointed with four things: Poor gas mileage, approximately 20 MPG, even in Highway driving. This vehicle (the 2.5) is severly underpowered, with poor pickup and hill climbing ability. The leg room in the back seat is very poor. It is impossible to tighten the rear view mirror and it moves when you hit a bump. An excellent buy if you don't mind getting poor mileage from special gas and never have anyone sitting in back."

It has the firm, sports-car oriented driving style that I like in a car.  I love driving this car far more than my '02 330i.  The car is a head turner.  Watch out though for possible electrical problems.  I have already had a window regulator go out on the back window.  Overall, I would buy this car again and again."
jaguar,x-type,2002,TDUBYA, 10/10/2006,Great pre-owned car for the modest price,4,"The Jaguar X-type 3.0 Sport is an excellent vehicle. Good gas mileage great entry level comfort and a very sexy appearance that could only come from Jaguar. Incredible pre-owned value for all those who've always wanted to own a Jag but couldn't fit it into their budget. The key to owning a reliable, pleasurable, fun to drive, X-type is to purchase a pre-owned one that is still under factory warranty, take it directly to your local Jag dealership, and have the maintenance department verify or carry out all the service bulletin upgrades, recalls and repairs which will be free of charge. After all services and repairs are complete take you vehicle home drive it and enjoy."
jaguar,x-type,2002,davidb, 11/29/2006,An Excellent Automobile,4,"This automobile is excellent except for three drawbacks: there is minimal space in the back for passengers, gas mileage is very poor, the wheels cannot be easily removed, they stick to the rotors.  It would be impossible to remove a wheel in an emergency. Otherwise an excellent car, well built and reliable."
jaguar,x-type,2002,Rich, 01/14/2007,It's far better than I suspected,5,"I just passed the 60,000 mile mark on my '02 X-Type 3.0 with five-speed manual.  The car has about all the options, including GPS NAV and the CD changer.   I recently had one maintenance problem with the car and that was the coolant thermostat intermittably stuck at about 58,000 miles.  It fully convered on Jag's Special Edition warranty.  No charge to me.  Other than that, the car's been trouble free. "
jaguar,x-type,2002,bigbaby, 02/06/2007,So far so good,4,"Bought used 2002 X-Type 2.5 for my wife whose 95 XJ6 finally bit the dust. Car has about 1 year left of certified pre-owned Jag warranty and 58K miles. Car is absolutely beautiful inside and out. Not a rocket but is ok to get around town. Took long trip in Texas and performed well, but I found the seats a bit tiresome on long drives. Tranny shifts quickly and smoothly."
jaguar,x-type,2002,Celtic, 03/06/2002,My X-type,4,"The more I drive The x-type, the more I love it.  I wanted a sports/luxury car.
Very nicely appointed, handles excellent
full of safty features and 4 wheel drive. I was disappointed to see the the reviews. The noise in the cabin is not overwhelming I think its ads to the sportiness of the ride the interior is absolutely perfect. Jaguar sales and service have been great so far."
jaguar,x-type,2002,Minimac, 03/21/2007,Beautiful and an excellent value,4,"I purchased this car used from the local Jaguar dealer with the 6 year 100,000 mile certified warranty, which made this car an incredible value.  It was $2,000 - $3,000 less then most new American sedans that had no features.  This is a beautiful automobile.  The all wheel drive is worth every penny, including the reduction in gas mileage.  The 5 speed automatic is perfectly matched for the 2.5 litre engine.  More horsepower would be a plus, but mid-range acceleration is still darned impressive considering this engine's displacement.  Great car for the money! As good as any European sedan at a lower price, better than most others."
jaguar,x-type,2002,Brad, 05/09/2007,Overall Great Car,4,"I bought my X-Type used a little over two years ago.  I have loved every minute of it.  I have not had any reliability issues with the car at all.  I  have only had it in to the dealer for routine service.  Also, the 2.5L V6 has more than enough power for daily driving.  Before I bought the car, I had read several reviews stating that the car was underpowered.  Unless you're buying this car to do drag racing, this is not the case.  I find it has as much, or even more power than my last car - a Infiniti I35 with a 3.5L V6. The X-Type's AWD system also has a leg up on the BMW 325xi.  This is a great car for the price!"
jaguar,x-type,2002,Tom, 06/15/2007,Great little car,4,"I bought this car because of its curb appeal and AWD. To date and 55000 miles later, I am not disappointed. I opted for standard transmission and the 3.0 engine and the car revs nicely when needed. Not a problem uphill or to pass at all. Gas mileage is a matter of driving styles, the Jag gives me 21-23 city and 23-25 highway. The car stills turns heads wherever I drive it"
jaguar,x-type,2002,KCnHouston, 07/12/2007,True Blue but often Yellow,4,"It was the best of cars, it was the worst of cars. After almost 5 years I still love this car. But the fun of driving a X-Type Sport 2.5 quickly wore thin after returning the car for service and repairs more often than I can remember.  I kept all of the records but I don't think that I will keep them in the car when I go to try to sell it because I don't want anyone to see how many times the car has needed repair. "
jaguar,x-type,2002,freedog, 09/24/2007,Diamond in the Rough,4,"I purchased this vehicle in May of 2007 as a CPO with 100k warranty and immediately took it cross country.  I compare this vehicle to Audi 3.0.  1. Biggest Surprise - handling! This car handles amazingly well and has better overall feel then the Audi because of it's 60% rear wheel drive, though steering wheel feedback is not as precise.  2. Biggest Disappointment - a few squeaks in the steering column and a noisy window at certain speeds.  3. Overall - with a 100k warranty, fantastic handling, Jag interior and ample horsepower, this is a perfect vehicle for those looking for a spirited car but with an eye more on luxury. Bonus is the mystical status that comes with the Jag name."
jaguar,x-type,2002,David J., 06/21/2007,Real Estate Machine,4,"I bought an 02 X-Type. I had upgraded from a 97 Cad STS. What a different car. I feel the Jag is more refined while remaining sporty. The all wheel drive is a must for the Colorado winters. In fact the X-Type is so good in the snow that I feel no need to purchase a SUV. The car has a few quirks like the turn signals won't turn off unless you make a full turn. I also wish the car had more driver leg room since I am 6'2"". Overall though I have to say that when I went to the dealer I was going to buy a BMW or Audi. I had such a bad attitude about the old Jags and their lack of reliability I didn't even want to test drive it. Once I drove it I immediately bought it and will drive nothing else. "
jaguar,x-type,2002,Cliff, 06/15/2007,Need re-engineering,3,"What a disappointment this car is. A lot of cheesy engineering. Transmission died at 45000 miles, cost $7200. Need new brake job at 42000 miles, cost $1,200. Can only be done by Jag or you can expect to hear brake noise, even with genuine pads and rotors.The vent cover pops up all the time near the windshield and makes noise, the driver seat moves forward 1/4"" - 1/2"" went stopping, the middle console rocks side-to-side like it's going to come apart.

went. I had to be towed via flatbed

The car never had any pep.  Now it needs
a totally new transmission at 12,000 miles.

and am satisfied with my decision. I've 
owned Acura, BMW and Mercedes. This is 
my first Jag and I'm a convert. I've 
had no problems with the exception of a 
seal on the washer fluid jet that would 
allow fluid to seep out when I exceeded 
65 mph. Dealer fixed it with no 
problems. I had my last Benz in the 
shop all the time. Turns more heads 
that a Benz or Bimmer. I wish the gas 
milage was better but considering it is 
AWD its better than any SUV and it will 
take me any where I need to go. 2003

bargin for its class. I definitely 
recommend this car. "
jaguar,x-type,2002,DC, 03/08/2002,Baby Jag,4,"X-Type is solid and a great performer. We looked at BMW-3, Mercedes C, and Audi. The Jag handled and rode better than all of them . It's plusher inside and the ride was very solid. Definitely drive one !!"

of use who want a Jag, but don't want 
to spend a crazy amount of money, and 
want a sporty car.  I wouldn't 
recommend it for the large family, but 
for a couple with a baby/child, this 
is perfect.  Note that the back seat

Typical windshield jet seeping and 
trunk popper button are the only things 
I've run across.  Drove this through a 
huge snow storm in NY (from Boston to 
Detroit) and was blowing by SUV's.  
This car grips the road like none other 
and is a blast in the corners.  2.5 
could use a little more kick, but w/ a 
5 speed manual/Sport Pkg. it's still a 
blast to drive.  Great looks and 
awesome in the Michigan winters....wish

been a dream come true.
I test drove the 3 series BMW, and Audi 
4, Mercedes C320 basically all the 
models in the price range and the

the Jag.The car is excellent. I guess 
you can always be unlucky and get a 
lemon with any make of car, like some 
of the reviews here have been.
Well worth checking this car out if you 
are buying a car in the 29k to 35k

jaguar,x-type,2002,Jess, 03/10/2008,A lot of little car.,4,I have owned this car for 8 months now and I believe I am sold on Jaguar for life.  It is such a joy to drive at any speed.  You can really feel the road with this car and you have to make a conscious effort to push it to the edges of its performance envelope.  I have the sport suspension and manual trans and when I get on a twisty road I really want to wring it out.  The car is very quiet with respect to wind and the all wheel drive and traction control systems are top notch.  The engine will rev to 7000rpm and has power from about 1500 rpm on up.  After owning about 20 cars I cannot praise this car enough if you like performance in your subtile family sedan.
jaguar,x-type,2002,frw, 05/26/2003,Great Sport !!!!!!!!!!,5,"Solid car. Can't beat the smell and

Accelerates like a rocket and handles

shy for this rather heavy car. What is 
most impressive is the road handling. 
It hugs the asphalt like a racing car

jaguar,x-type,2002,charles Fillmore, 03/11/2002,my x-type experience,4,If you are looking for a fun car to drive and service beyond exceptional jaguar has it in the x-type. The handling is unbelievable. The more I drive this car the more I realize I truly found the car for me.
jaguar,x-type,2002,kmac, 12/03/2007,take the good with the bad,4,"I purchased my X-type a couple years used and I believe I got a great value for the money, thanks to the high rate of depreciation on Jags. The car has been fairly reliable for me; it looks like it cost 3 times more than I paid for it; and the AWD is great in snow.  The the downside of owning a used Jag is that once the warranty runs out (along with the included maintenance), upkeep is costly, especially at the dealership where $500 to $1,000 for scheduled maintenance is normal. I would say that if you value the ""cool factor"" more than such practical considerations as reliability, resale value, maintenance costs, etc., then this is great car for the money - if you bought used that is."
jaguar,x-type,2002,ED, 03/13/2002,X is the way to go!,4,"Yes, it's not an $80,000 luxury car but it's still a Jaguar. It's fun to drive, handles well, looks great and I have no complaints."
jaguar,x-type,2002,Scubaguy5, 03/13/2002,Best in Class!,4,"I took delivery 3 months ago, have put on 4500 miles since with NO  problems whatsoever.  My Jag handles great in the dry, and will outhandle anything in the rain! 2.5 Litre motor needs to be in the right gear for max power, but has a very wide powerband, and IMO is equal to the BMW 6 for smoothness and refinement.Frankly, I dont understand what people are talking about with the interior and quality issues.  My car is rock solid, and the interior (and exterior) is better finished than Mercedes and/or BMW.  I got my car delivered with flawless paint, leather seats, birds-eye maple dash, all wheel drive, 5 speed manual trans, and a 6 disk CD changer for exactly $31,000.  Eat your heart out."
jaguar,x-type,2002,DAC17, 03/13/2002,Jaguar x-type initial thoughts,4,"Had the car for about a month.  No problems with it.  Had at least 10 people (unasked) tell me how much they loved the looks of the car.  The interior is typical Brit; gorgeous and aromatic!

Great lease deals going on; interest rates about 1.6%, and good discounts.  Early reviews in Edmunds probably didn't help residuals (not that Jags are very good residual-wise anyway)"
jaguar,x-type,2002,JHP, 03/15/2002,The 3.0 Manual is the Ultimate Jag,4,"This car defines sporty luxury.  It is sleek, powerful, refined, fun to drive and perfectly balanced (can you say ""become one with the car""?).  I have yet to approach the handling or performance limits of the 3 liter/manual combination.  But I can tell you that this car is truly fast and very tossable when you want it to be.  And the AWD provides remarkable and reassuring traction, especially in the rain.  Combine such performance with the Jag's beatiful form inside and out, and it's clearly the class act of luxury performance cars."
jaguar,x-type,2002,libby, 03/16/2002,Edmunds Confuses the X-type issue,4,"This is a very good car, which is comparatively cheap if you stick to the base model, which Motor Trend describes as surprisingly quick.  I bought it because of good initial reviews, including a very positive one on the Edmunds web site.  Then I was distressed to see Edmunds reverse itself with an extremely negative review.  More recently there has been a grudgingly neutral review, which still describes lower speed statistics than the ones in Motor Trend, Car and Driver,etc.   How can Edmunds be useful to buyers if they keep contradicticting themselves?"

jaguar,x-type,2002,coolycat, 03/19/2002,Edmunds is WAY OFF!,4,"The car drives like a dream...Edmunds puts it down like a hot potato and I can't understand why...they seem to be in love with BMW 3's (which I used to drive) and can't get over them (geez)...anyways...drive one yourself...if you dig driving the streets like a rocket, then go for the BMW...if you like a sporty, great handling, powerful, classy, CAR (ie., ages from 30-65), then drive the Jaguar..."
jaguar,x-type,2002,Blake, 03/19/2002,Excellent,4,"I traded in my 2001 Lincoln LS for this Jag. Overall I'am very happy with it. The Jag dealership cannot compare to the excellent customer service to the Lincoln one though. My impression was that they are kinda snobby, and they looked at me kinda funny as I assume they don't think a 25 year old can afford a jag. 2 hours later I drove off the lot with one."
jaguar,x-type,2002,Scott Simpson, 03/22/2002,I highly recommend this car,4,"I am for a car shopping for a month now. I considered MB C240, Audi A4 3.0, BMW 325i, Lexus ES 300, and Jaguar X-type 2.5. And the winner was Jaguar. Excellent interior quality and design, awesome handling, acceleration, low noise and precise road stability. Audi was underpowered and noisy. MB had so cheap interior so I even refused test drive. BMW lacked in interior design. And Lexus was too small, underpowered and colored in as a parrot."
jaguar,x-type,2002,sagestrike, 03/24/2002,"X-Type, A Great Breed of New Cat",4,"Great little preformer.  Handles like a sports car but is comfortable enough to compete as a luxury car.  It is a large departure from other Jaguar models.  This one should be considered if you are looking at competing models from Audi, BMW or Mercedes.  You won't be disappointed."
jaguar,x-type,2002,Jgrnaut, 03/26/2002,Why would you want this car?,2,"The name Jaguar conjures up images of refined elegance and bold styling. After driving the X-Type, the words Jaguar and &#8220;refined elegance&#8221; seems to fit together like Shaq in a Mazda Miata. When you sit in the cockpit, you understand why it is priced so cheap (for a Jaguar.) I think there was a shortage of quality leather when the car was built because most of the surroundings were made of plastic, high quality plastic I&#8217;m sure, but never the less plastic. Once I stepped on the gas it seemed like I had 4 sumo-wrestlers in the back and a few in the trunk. On the good side, the key is really neat and it has that cool leaping jaguar on the hood."
jaguar,x-type,2002,DAH, 03/28/2002,A Great Road Car,4,"The people that don't like this car must be people that have not drive this car more than around the block.

jaguar,x-type,2002,lanmare, 03/28/2002,Jaguar vs Volvo,4,I have been a Volvo owner for over twenty years.  I read about the X-type the day after Christmas.  Stopped by the dealership and did a test drive.  Bought the car on the spot.  I love the way it hugs the road and negotiates mountain roads.  Gas mileage is the same as I was getting on my newest Volvo.  Folks at the dealership were great to me.  They are very customer orientated.  I like that.
jaguar,x-type,2003,str8cash, 10/17/2012,A SOLID RELIABLE CAT,4,"I have owned this x-type for 3 years and I bought it with 125,000 miles on it. I am the 2nd owner.It now has 160,000+ miles and still runs & looks like new. Only things I have had to do is oil changes and a new coolant tank ($129.00 ebay).
This car was very well maintained by the original owner and that is key. She had all maint records and only major repair was new rear struts. Other items were normal wear items, brake pads, oil changes,tune up, coolant flush, tires, battery,etc. I have owned several Lexus, BMW, Infiniti, Acura, Cadillac, Mercedes vehicles and this is my favorite. AWD is fantastic. Car is now 10 yrs old & still gets looks.
I would recommend this car without question."
jaguar,x-type,2003,Jaquar Owner, 07/24/2006,Jaguar X-Type 2003,4,"The Jaguar X-Type 2.5L has the stance of champion race car but, unfortunately, its designers and engineers forgot about the power curve.  Its power to weight is insufficient to move it quickly from a standing start even if you jump on the accelerator.  If you want that kind of performance, don't buy this car.  For me, that didn't matter, the car rides like a dream in all weather conditions, tracks straight and true and no amount of snow can stop it.  The sound system is excellent.  If you like cruising, this car will hum along at 100 mph. all day without a problem.  Remember: The X-Type was bred for the autobahn not the drag strip. If that's what you're looking for, this is the car for you."

Yes, the X-type is not a standard Jag, but with gas at $4, who would want one? This car is perfect for what we all do -- drive to work, the Metro or run a few errands. I find nothing ""cheap"" about the interior; the camel interior goes beautifully with the British racing green exterior. Yes, I can't get to 60 mph in 5.5 seconds, but Ford (which has a long tradition in building British cars) has put together just the right package of performance, appearance and creature comforts to make this car worth every dime. You'd be a fool to waste your money on a far more expensive German or high-end Japanese car."

Sprained left hand, bump and bruise on rt knee. Airbag deployed, but no other bruises etc. hit head on, missed the jag on hood, headlights in tact. Radiator pushed in, motor to be assessed. ALOT of safety features deployed. Yet to have the adjuster take a look. 12-31- 09 so it's  been 10 days. We'll know when we get the hood up. Either way, this girl was the best car I ever had (have).

jaguar,x-type,2003,Pete, 07/07/2006,X-tremely Pleased,4,"Purchased used with 12,000 miles for about 1/2 original retail.  The manual 5 spd. provides plenty of zip with the 2.5, and the AWD handles like a dream.  By far the best feature is the exterior styling  but a close second is the outstanding warranty Jag provides on certified used cars (bumper to bumper, 100k/6 years from original date of purchase).  Finally, I enjoy not seeing dozens of other cars like mine (I see about a dozen BMW 3 series for each X-Type), and people think I spent a LOT more than I did! Someday, I'll graduate to an XK, but I hope to be a Jaguar owner for life."

jaguar,x-type,2003,speedster2, 02/14/2007,Misconceptions,4,"I bought the Jaguar X-Type 2003 used and I do not regret it one bit. When considering to buy this car, everyone doubted it, saying its only nice on the exterior. I was told the reliability was terrible, no dealerships in the area, and that it was not worth the headache because the parts are expensive. I have not had to bring the car in to the dealership ONCE, only for an oil change. Overall this car is a fantastic buy, great price, GREAT reliability, and tons of fun. I have this car at college, and it gets looks of admiration and impression. Another great feature of this car is it all wheel drive, which is unusual for an SUV. I am very grateful for buying it."
jaguar,x-type,2003,Barry, 12/08/2018,I love my Brit!,4,"My X-Type is an automatic 2.5 not a manual as the description says. (Automatic not included). I traded for it used 3 years ago with 110,000 miles. Even though I don't have any service records, it had obviously been very well maintained and garage kept. After reading some forums about the X-Type, I had the transmission flushed and filled and the transfer case fluid changed. It needed 2 tires and that's it. I recently did a LOT of maintenance that a car of this age and mileage needs. Other than the tires the car has ""needed"" nothing. I look forward to driving it every time I get in. It's comfortable, handles great and make me feel special. The ride is a tad rough but I wouldn't trade the handling for a smoother ride. I've owned a lot of cars in my life and I have to say the Jag is my 2nd favorite car that I've had. (My 1st fave was a 1987 Mazda RX-7, I'm too old and fat for that now...lol). I plan on having the Jag for a long time!

jaguar,x-type,2003,b. dandar, 08/03/2006,Kudos to X-Type,5,"Before buying the X-Type I used to drive an XJ8.  Although I love the style and ride of the XJ8, I always felt that the XJ8 was too much car for me (I am 5' tall and petite).  The X-Type is a glove fit for me and I am so pleased that I made the change.  My husband who has an XR series, was firmly against the X-Type predicting a litany of problems, etc.  Happily, I have had no problems. The X-Type is sporty and stylish with many of the interior features of the XJ8. The trunk space is much larger than in the XJ8 and the rear seats fold down with minimal effort if more space is needed.  I feel so connected with my car and I'll be in the market again within the next two years for another X-Type!"

It was a blessing that fell in my lap and once I saw what a great deal it was I couldn't pass it up.  Well, 4 months later I am deftly happy with it.  I have had no issues whatsoever and it gets many head nods.  I just tell all the people who think I must be cavorting a lot more money than they thought to be driving it, that a blessing came my way and it keeps blessing me over and over again.

It is not a performance monster, but has good pick up and decent gas mileage (hwy has hit 28 mpg, averages 26-27, around 22 in town).

The interior is soothingly comfortable and the exterior is exciting.  This car is the smoothest, quietest car I've ever owned and the 2.5 motor will have me collecting speeding tickets if I'm not careful. I get 26 mpg around town and still look for opportunities to just get out and drive.  I'm 6-2 but the interior fits me fine.  I love the looks and comments I get and that it looks more expensive then it is. I can't imagine ever needing more then this - ""Baby Jag"" delivers!"

had the transmission replaced 2X!  They 
finally had to admit that they had 
transmission problems with these cars.  
I have talked to other X-Type owners

thing.  At first the dealer denied 
there was a problem until I made a real 
stink. It still isn't right so they are 
calling in Jaguar HQ."
jaguar,x-type,2003,Padre for Life, 09/05/2003,Is subdued ok?,3,"IMO the X-type lacks the soul and 
character that BMW, Audi, and now Acura 
do well building into their cars. It 
definitely looks the part, with its 
Jaguar styling cues and the leaper on 
the hood.  But it doesn¬ít have any of 
driver dynamics (handling, performance, 
or quantitative feel) or the solidity 
(build quality, qualitative feel) that 
the aforementioned class leaders have.  
Yes, the X-type rides well, handles 
competently, and has adequate zip but 
it doesn't exude that driving 
excitement to make we want to drive it 
hard and fast.  Maybe that's what 
Jaguar's after, a subdued experience.  
If that's what you¬íre looking for the X-
type is right up your alley."

The young guy i traded with said he would he would trust it going anywhere. I could tell right away that he was right. I have owned many many cars in my live, but not one that handles and drives a fraction as good as this. I like to think that i have a 6th sense about the longevity and reliabilityo of a car after all my years? Well, my sense meter was off the charts with this 5 speed manual. I think this car will drive and handle this good for years to come, simply because it isn't working hard to do it. I do declare that I am profoundly impressed. It was a very nice bike that I traded for this car, but I am blown away at how sweet this car really is. Wow!

jaguar,x-type,2003,jagnomore, 12/13/2018,Its good looking but it has issues... like women,3,"I bought the 2.5 X-Type for my wife in 2008. I was one owner and looked very well taken care of. Tons of dealer receipts and only 45K on the dial.  But just like a beautiful wife or girlfriend, it has issues, you just can't have it all. Throughout the years I have had to do the regular maintenance which is not bad I take care of all my cars. Then came the O2 Sensors, Bank 1 Bank 2 then the lower catalytic converter, then the vacuum system, valve cover leaking. At this point we have gotten a lot of use out of it. It has 1600000 miles on it . Now I have a check engine light (flashing) with and an e-brake light on and ABS light on. The car drives fine but won't go over 3K RPM, the forums to fix this suggest a myriad of things that are quite frankly more expensive than what the car is worth. I'll drive it till the it falls apart I guess.  I guess it was a reliable car for 10 years of its life 2003 to 2013.

jaguar,x-type,2003,Barryl, 11/16/2002,X-Type review by a Brit,4,"I bought the X-Type for my own 50th
Birthday! So far I have covered just
less than 1000 miles, so it is
admittedly a little early to say, but
the car has been faultless, both on
delivery and in use. Mine is a manual
Sport - I didn't want the auto on this
car. The car is much quieter than I
expected and very refined, such that now
I tend to listen to classical music!
Lots of extras made the car rather
expensive - these are
mainly individual in the UK, not big
option packs as in the States. Would
definitely recommend the reverse-park
sensor which I have, as rearward
visibility is not too good. Standard
headlights are quite good, but I wish
now I'd bought the Xenon option."
jaguar,x-type,2003,nypsych, 02/05/2003,Ford's version of a Jaguar,3,"Took delivery of my new X-type in
December.  The motor runs well, the car
is quiet.  Handling, however, is not
good.  The car and steering wheel bounce
and rumble - perhaps the AWD gears
aren't smooth.  As a result, the car has
very poor feel of the road, since the
steering wheel bounces on its own, along
with the car freame - worse as the car
speeds up.  Ride is adequate at low
speeds, however.

The seat was loose and the tires
underinflated and way out of balance as
delivered.  Handling improved a little
when I had the tires balanced, but still
not right (see above).

Still a Ford, and a great disappointment."
jaguar,x-type,2003,msiseng, 02/08/2003,Do Not Let The Review Fool You,4,"Bravo to Ford for resurrecting this 
line of vehicle.  

Do not let the reviews fool you; this 
is a nice car for the money.  The 2.5 
is quick enough and very nimble.  In 
fact, the 3.0 does not feel that much 
quicker.  The dual exhaust (Y-Pipe) is 
a nice surprise for the '03 model year 
producing more torque at higher 
speeds.  

Jaguar service is superb and is 
welcome after SUFFERING through VOB

the car was mine. I purchased a base 
model with a 5 speed manual. Almost 
right away, the heater broke, which, is 
a bummer in Oregon during the Winter.  
So, back to the dealer ship and then we 
waited for parts.  To make a long story 
short, we eventually ended up with 
another X type as the first one was not 
fixable.  To show there appreciation 
for the problem they gave me a S type 
as a loaner (During my three week wait) 
and when I got my new X type back, they 
upgraded me to 17"" wheels at no extra 
charge!  "
jaguar,x-type,2003,X owner, 10/27/2009,Buy new every four years,2,"Bought my Jag used with 12,000 miles. Dealer gave us two new tires.  At 22,000 had to replace all 4, this was with proper rotation schedule. Needed brakes every 30,000.  It has always hated cold weather even though it was garage kept. Major hose repairs at 30,000. New battery at 60,000. Key fob still unlocks, up close. Driver door lock system had to be replaced. Drivers door panel fell off due to broken clips, twice! Not to mention the constant repair of the passenger side defroster vent so it would not rattle. Also found rust starting on hood, almost one year after rust warranty has ended. Have 78,000 miles. The engine light is on again. Trading this week. What a relief! Kept 'cause no payment."

am quite impressed by its handling and 
the smooth ride. Before this car I 
leased a BMW 328i(99 model), it was a 
fine car with nice handling. But the 
gas mileage sucked and the ride was 
quite bumpy. The X-type feels much 
stabler and smoother on the highway. 
And I like the handling of X-type 
better. One complain is the space 
(head room and leg room) should be 
bigger."
jaguar,x-type,2003,keith, 11/17/2010,Just Great,5,"Bought the car with 60K miles and now after just over 2 years have 144,000 miles. Only just replaced brakes, replaced radiator overflow tank and put in new plugs at 100K.  Have done nothing else.  Gas mileage is great.  Paid $10K and get offers for $7-8K all the time. Most people think it is a 20K+ car.  Great for road trips.  Handles great in all areas.  I expect to easily get another 100K miles out of this car.  "
jaguar,x-type,2003,Hank, 07/21/2008,A nice car that I love to keep,4,"This car has meant several things to me: Nice looks, decent power (3 liter), all wheel drive (AWD) versatility and of course, the Jaguar brand name. It feels great when friends and strangers recognize the brand and make positive comments about its looks. This is my 5th year of ownership and I still like its looks and feel. I liked it so much I decided to not trade it in when I recently bought a new car. The 3 liter engine feels strong and satisfying in most situations although the automatic transmission loses a second or two when downshifting in sudden acceleration. It makes up for this in smooth operation when needing to pass. Last but not least, the AWD feature has been great in snow/ice. "
jaguar,x-type,2003,taxmom2000, 01/04/2003,I am not happy,3,"My x-type has 4000 miles and is going 
into the shop for the 3rd time. I have 
an annoying whistle, so they replaced 
the drive shaft, but the whistle came 
back. Now I am waiting for a new 
transmission, they think that is where 
the noise is coming from.
The other problem is with the gas tank 
design. If the gas pump hits the door 
spring the wrong way, it knocks the 
spring off and you can't open the door, 
unfortunately Jaguar didn't design the 
car with a release in the trunk, so I 
had to go back to Jaguar to get the  
tank door opened before I could get gas.
For the money, I expected a much 
smoother ride and it isn't there."

Regarding power, it accelerates just fine, I don't need a racecar to go back and forth to work or run errands. As for issues regarding the small rear seat, this is a small car, not a Chevrolet Impala. It's meant to be small and nimble, which is part of what makes it perfect.

it has been leased for a year or less, 
with 10000 or less miles. Handles the

driven.  We are x type owners for

The reality is that it is not unique

am not surprised since Ford does own

What a mistake! The instrument gauges work intermittently (YES, sometimes they are just still, reading 0 MPH when on the freeway, etc.), the car SQUEAKS over every bump and dip in the road, the automatic headlights only work when they want to, and the dashboard vents curl up (had these replaced under warranty twice, still curls up! I've given up on these). The rear park sensors don't always work. NOT acceptable for a $36k car. Look elsewhere when shopping in this category."

Type looks like a Mercury Sable or 
other cars.  Are they blind!  The 
exterior looks nothing like a Sable.  
Nor does the interior look like a Sable 
in fact its beautiful and as good or 
better than that of any car in any 
class today under $100,000. The 
interior layout was so well done that 
Jaguar has now adopted the identical 
design for the new versions of their 
more expensive and larger S and XJ 
types. Its also a great use of space 
with a surprisingly large trunk and a 
light airy cabin.  When I see another X-
type on the road I can¬ít believe it 
appears so small on the outside.  The 
whole package is great."

and handling. After switching between my Vette and the Jag., the usually 
reorientation between vehicles has narrowed considerably. Wisconsin 
winters no longer are the challenge they were in the past. Styling is a plus. 
Its is super ego boost to have the number of people who stop to look her over

actually not planning to test drive 
the Jaguar given the mixed reviews 
regarding the early 2002 models. 
However, my wife pushed for a test 
ride; we were surpised to find 
ourselves hooked. The car handles very 
well. The 2.5 is plenty sufficient to 
keep things interesting. While maybe 
not as fast as the G35, the car is 
lots of fun to drive and has 
character. With the free service and 
our deal price of $28,000 for a base 
model/manual, the value is high. 1k on 
the car to date."

BMW service is the most awful, painful 
experience ever!  Audi is great, but 
the old A4 was too tight inside.

The X-type gives you performance and a 
service/dealership experience far 
superior to BMW or Audi.

To the car - great car inside and out 
for an unbelievable price.  We got the 
factory lease deal and had a no haggle

car with tons of Jaguar options.  On 
the negative, the build quality is 
disappointing - coolant leak, driver 
seat repairs, interior trim rattles & 
squeaks, and the car is less than 3 
months old.  Jaguar is good about 
fixing the issues & service is what you 
expect from a high-end car company.
Even with those issues, I still rate it 
very high -- the rattles don't impact 
the all-round performance of the car.  
It beats the SUVs in poor weather 
performance & fuel economy, not to 
mention the status of being a Jaguar.  
Oh yes, the price was less than most 
SUV's too."

takes time to get use to is the 
brakes, the gas pedal, and the 
transmission. The brakes take time to 
get use to because in a way you kinda 
have to push harder than you think to 
get stoped where you want to. The gas 
pedal takes time to get use to because 
it is very light and touchy, and very 
responsive. The Transmission takes 
time to get use to because when you 
first start driveing when the engine 
is still cold it seams like the engine 
is doing alot of shifting, and it you 
can feel the shifting, but as soon as 
the engine is warmed up the Jag ride

and it puts the fun back in driving. 
I've had a few problems with it, but 
the dealer has never let me down by 
providing a loaner while my car is 
serviced. Even though its the least 
expensive Jag, it impresses others when 
you say you have a Jag. I also noticed 
that garages treat you differently when 
you pull in and bring yu your car.
It's not the price of the car, but the 
image it conveys"

2.5 was fine, but I wanted more power
and speed.  The 3.0 has plenty.  Also,
the X-Type in general is the best
handling car on the road.  During a very
snowy winter this past year, I did not
lose traction at all.  It is also the
best looking car on the road, in my
biased opinion!"

everyone in the restaurant was talking 
about the bright red Jag in the 
parking lot.  Two weeks later I picked

around $33K with ABS/dynamic stability, 
heated seats, &c. You won't be able to 
accelerate fast enough to burn rubber 
from a dead stop, but jeez - grow up a 
little. If you can afford the car, you 
probably are old enough to have a 
family, and the trunk size is very 
good. The 2.5  gets up to highway speed 
very easily (5 speed automatic) and it 
corners really well, with a quiet solid 
feel under all conditions, especially 
on bumpy roads. Also, the all-wheel

X-Type is much more comfortable that my
'99 Cadillac Catera and a lot more
stylish but just not as zippy. The Sport
mode helps some as does the J-Shift
automatic transmission. All in all, this
entry-level Jaguar is a great buy.
Routine maintenance coverage is an
unexpected bonus."

at 70 all the time. Also I think the 
fuel ecomomy is below average.  You 
would think for a car this size economy 
would be better.  It looks nice on the 
outside and nice on the inside, but I 
don't feel like it is built the way it 
should be for the price.  Kinda feels 
like a rental.  I owned the 3 series

great and got lots of looks!  I had to 
go to an All-Wheel drive due to all the

the auto show back in February I spent 
all year convincing myself I needed to 
buy one.  With a 191,000 miles on my 10 
yr old Park Ave, I figured it's only a 
matter of time before it died.  Taking 
advantage of year end close out sales I 
found myself a 2.5 sport package in

still drive the Buick until it's death.

the available seat adjustment, it gives 
very little room for the rear passenger.

As a drivers car, it has few equals. 
The All Wheel Drive gives great 
confidence in all weather conditions. 
The superb road handling can give the 
impression the car is on rails! 

Powered by the zesty 3.0 litre engine

that you are behind a turbo charged V8!

It is truly a wonderful vehicle despite it's poor reputation.  The drive is very smooth, the engine quiet and refined.  The leather and wood wraps you in luxury that feels much more expensive than what the car actually costs.   Prepare to get to know your service advisor if you purchase one of these cars, however.  In the 5 months that I've had mine, it's been in the shop for about a month.  No major problems have been encountered, just replacing parts that had rattles, whines, vibrations, etc.  As long as it's under warranty, I want as smooth a ride as I can get"

back and forth from Ohio to Florida

I love it. I have all the options 
except navigation. I am waiting to see 
what the AWD does in the Chicago snow. 
I would definately buy another. Just 
one thing, for the price I think the 
car should have a bit more of a super-
charged engine, a little more get up 
and go or possibly a better transition 
when vehicle is shifting gears and a 
better suspension or tires even, could 
feel a little more softer over bumps,

those. Other than that, this 50's plus

Handles like a dream (the AWD is amazing), but could use just a bit more punch in 1st gear.  Acceleration from 20 mph on is just fine.  Quiet ride and gets compliments everywhere I go.  Very satisfied with performance, reliability, and gas mileage (24 mpg with 50/50 highway and local driving, and I tend to punch it a lot).  Looking to upgrade to either a 3.0 X-Type Sport or used XK8 next year."

than 30K and this one came on top for 
the type and options included. The 
vehicle did come with a lot of options, 
but with some patience and a great 
sales individual I managed to get a 
great deal for it.

The ride is what's expected of a 
European sedan. The steering is precise 
and the transmission is smooth. Because 
it is a 2.5 the acceleration is not 
that strong, but sufficient enough to 
provide a joyful ride. The finish 
inside is good, and the chrome

Against all odds, she has performed far more better than anyone expected. Surprisingly, my most harshest critics have never driven in a Jaguar, therefore they have never experienced its distinction & luxurious feel. She's a rarity on any road.

interior space feels a bit tight, and

poor at best, but the way it is 
assembled is worse.  
I have been buying new cars for over 35

the jaguar standard (in my book) the 
continetal tires should be replaced

more road noise than it should, tires 
might help. We also have had serveral 
rattles within the interior. It seems 
to be a little pricey for an entry 
level car. I have also drove the entry 
level acura. It seems to offer a little 
more for the money. It also is a lot 
more quite on the road than the jag. We 
do enjoy the level of service once the

It had 117k, was in excellent shape (except tires), and only one previous owner. The car has been great - routine maintenance, replaced compressor for A/C, couple of minor repairs, all done by local garage vs Jag dealer - less than $2200 in 4 years. Heads-up: rear seat leg room minimal. Fabric covering front roof supports has separated - used fabric glue to repair (easy fix). Requires premium gasoline - upside is it gets 25-27 mpg on trips, only 20 around town. AWD a plus however low ground clearance hinders going in deep snow. Been a great car - no regrets!"

I've driven close to 2k miles and absolutely no complaints.
Super smooth shifting, quick acceleration, very quiet ride - except for hearing the transmission (apparently common) and a little wind noise at highway speeds if I have the interior shade for sunroof pulled back.

We also had a 1989 XJ6 at the time, and knew Jaguar's spotty reputation for reliability was for real with the XJ6.
Not so for the X-type...it has had less problems than any other automobile I have ever owned.
Only mistake I made was buying an extended warranty; all other cars I have done this with, this has paid off, but not for the X-Type..which has been nearly trouble free for the entire extended warranty period.
I highly recommend this car.

jaguar,x-type,2004,Derek Echanique, 05/12/2016,One of the best cars you can buy,5,"This is my 2nd car I have owned in my 3 years of driving. I originally bought it because when I was a kid my dad had a Jag XJ8L and I loved it. This car has been outstanding for me. But I was given a offer that I couldn't refuse which made me put the Jag up for a little. I ended up driving a BMW 740iL (E38) Sport for about a year and a half. But coming back to the Jag was a great decision. I can't more pleased to return to a car. The only down side of that is the BMW had a V8 vs a V6 so I am use to a little bit more power, but I can get over that. This car is outstanding!

Whether in sport mode or regular this Jag hugs the road like a dream, stops on a dime, and accelerates on demand.  Of course, I did service my car regularly- -which helps with whatever car you own. I had no doubt in my mind that the car would have rolled over 300,000 miles.  I've owned Mercedes, Lexus and BMW and would (hands down) place this car above all of those on reliability and performance.  I am currently looking for another X-type to replace it!  "

The car is not perfect as it has been in the shop several times and I've spent about $2000 on little annoyances in just a few months, but I feel safe and its no lemon. Be sure to find a reputable repairman quick! The car is BEAUTIFUL to look at and after a year of ownership I still turn back and look at it.  The interior is also nice but the seats are a little flat. Gas mileage is OK and my 3.0 in sport mode picks up pretty well. In sum if you're looking for a true luxury car you may want to look elsewhere but if you're young and looking for a eye-catching ride you can't go wrong with the X-type 3.0."
jaguar,x-type,2004,Pete04XType, 06/22/2010,So good I am getting another one,4,"I purchased my 04 certified from a local Jaguar dealer. It has been nothing short of excellent. The car is 6 yrs old and still gets compliments where ever I go. I keep it mostly dealer serviced and it has really not cost me much in repairs. With the select warranty they have fixed the little things that have popped up, but nothing major so far. I like it so much that I am trading it back to the dealer for another low mileage X Type with more options. I was hooked the first time I drove it and the awd system is excellent. I can drive through anything with other cars and trucks are stuck on the side of the road. I wish that Jaguar still made them or came up with a gen II X Type. Hello Jaguar!"

Besides new wheels and a few other replaced parts, they provided a second new set of tires, again alligned and balanced of course, and I took the car up to 90 on the highway with zero vibration evident, and a whole new ride overrall. Then when I went through my glove compartment to review the Registration paperwork, I found another envelope with my name on it -- inside was cash equal to my first month's paymment. 
 
The Dealer carries all highline and next to highline vehicles at bottom line pricing and obviously backs up the customer in regard to the New York State Warranty rules.

center armrest console is rubbish and creaks and moans if you put any weight on it.

There is no trunk button in the interior.
I've never heard of a car without a release.

Requires expensive premium fuel, for this price point, a really bad idea.

There's more room in my ford fusion.
there's more room in an audi a4.

The gas mileage is appalling.
I drive 98% freeway miles and i get 20 mpg and i hear most people get much worse."
jaguar,x-type,2004,dwbarry, 12/08/2010,Great Car,4,"I bought my X-Type new in 2004 and still have it.
After over 90K miles there are only two problems - the interior cloth material falling away from the front and read roof posts (like several others have mentioned) and the headlight assembly breaking due to what I guess is the front end stiffness.

My dealer in New Orleans has been terrific and fixed the interior cloth issue for free.
The headlight repair estimate was quit expensive so I've opted to operate the car with less than perfectly aligned headlights.

Overall the car has been one the best cars I've owned in 41 years of driving."
jaguar,x-type,2004,kkakear, 04/07/2009,"Cat, Subies and Bimmers, 70K update.",4,"OK, so said I wouldn't buy it out of the lease and I did anyway. It was the cheapest thing to do. Just put shocks, struts, tires and front brakes on it, all wear items. Haven't had any other problems other than a front axle seal leak, covered under warranty. The car's style stands out in a sea of styling mediocrity and angry kitchen appliances. Gas mileage stands at 23 MPG on premium fuel over 71K miles. Never any major problems, just a bunch of annoying small ones and it has never left us sitting, unlike every Japanese car we've ever owned."
jaguar,x-type,2004,jaguar Man in L.A., 09/26/2003,"Good, but not Fantastic",3,"The X-type looks great inside and out. 
To me it looks like a mini XJ.  There 
are several items that I would like to 
point out to potential buyers.  I have 
the 3.0 Liter but it is weak with 
hardly any torque.  Gas mileage is 
horrible.  Much less than the sticker 
says.  I drive about 1/2 city 1/2 
highway, and average only 17 MPG. Also, 
the car has alot of rattles, and the 
springs are very squeeky.  The car 
rides very harsh, especially on dips or 
rough roads.  Overall a decent car, but 
the lack of build quality really shows. "
jaguar,x-type,2004,devargo, 10/15/2008,"Scary at times, but so far, so good.",4,"Got this in June 07 with 32k miles. Now have 55k on it, and the only repair has been a worn tie-rod end.  I have heard horror stories about Jaguar reliability over the years, but I took the plunge and am glad I did.  One thing I never get over is the odd noises that this car makes.  Squeals, whines, whistles, bumps, woomps, thumps, etc.  For one thing, it appears that every road noise comes inside.  For another, wind noise actually makes a whistling around the A pillars.  But, overall, I can't complain.  22-24 mpg, good looks, good performance, lots of features, and the cachet of owning a Jag for under $20000. Still keeping my fingers crossed, but so far, glad I bought this car."
jaguar,x-type,2004,eye candy, 11/17/2008,Bitter sweet,4,"Unfortunately I have fallen in love with this car! It is a beauty to look at and I get lots of compliments. Always asked do I want to sell it. However, I am always nervous. The reliability is a big question mark. It has been repaired twice since purchase (9 months ago) and the check engine light is on as I type. I'm afraid I will have to part with her, if I have any more problems. "
jaguar,x-type,2004,KKear, 12/27/2008,"Cats, Bimmers and Subies 70K Update",4,"I bought it out of the lease only because it was the cheapest way to go. The tire wear was somewhat solved by using Fuzion HRi tires, good for about 30K miles. The headlights bulbs by going to GE silverstars, and the dash vents, superglue. Now the shocks all need replacement, and it's a good thing this car is mostly Ford because most anyone can work on it. The dealer wants an arm, leg and one or two other appendages to replace them. I will be wary of buying another Jaguar."
jaguar,x-type,2004,moni, 06/08/2009,Love my Jag,4,"I have had my car for a few years now. I bought it used in 06 and now it is 09. I have just done the 60k tune up and I still love it as much as the day I brought it home. It is older, has some scratches but I love the AWD (main reason I didn't buy a Mercedes) and it suits me and my personality. I have never had any problems at all with my car... and now if I had the money would probably buy the new one!! Jag baby... Jag."
jaguar,x-type,2004,Jeff, 06/26/2009,Not the stereo-type Jaguar,4,I have a 2.5 X-type with 5-speed which I purchased new and it's now about 5 year old. This car has had one warranty issue in 5 years and otherwise it has been perfect.  Handling is great although you must be willing to let the car lean into a curve on back roads.  AWD has been great for trips to Vermont.  I will definitely buy another Jaguar.  The old stereotype of quality is way over.  This is a very good entry luxury car for the money and it's not just as common as dirt like so many other makes either German or Japanese.
jaguar,x-type,2004,Pete V., 06/25/2009,A great baby Jag,4,"I purchased my jag new in 2004, and still own it and love it. After comparing it to BMW 325, MB C240 and others, it was the best car for the price. I still get lots of on lookers and the car looks / runs great with no problems after almost 5 years. It also came with a ""no cost"" maintenance for 4 years, so all I paid for was gas until today. :-)"
jaguar,x-type,2004,David, 10/07/2009,Why bad reviews?,4,"I do not understand why Edmunds rates this car down, I nearly did not buy it in '04 because of that and it has been a terrific car!  It handles wonderful in all types of road conditions, it has great pep and I always get 26+mph, if I slow down to speed limit of 5 above it goes up to 27+.  Even after 5 years people still admire it and make comments.  I always trade by 4 years but I can't find anything I like better. The only criticism I have is premium gas requirement.  The ride is a bit stiff but the handling more than makes up for it.  Listen to the owners Edmunds, we like this car."
jaguar,x-type,2004,Jaguar man, 12/21/2009,Awesome Luxury Car,4,I just bought my first jaguar A 2004 Jaguar x type 3.0 With sport package And love it..It seems to ride great good pick up power all around great car a little expensive for insurance and plates but the car is well worth it..Love the heated seats and the seats are very comfortable I have put 3000 miles already on it... A very dependable car. I love the looks that people give when they see the car -  looks like a million bucks very sleek look. The gas millage is not as good as advertised but I get about 20 miles to the gallon. I did do a lot of research on this car before I bought it and seen a lot of positive stuff about it
jaguar,x-type,2004,oh well, 03/17/2010,who has a lemon,4,"I was looking for schematics of the front diff. (pumpkin) and came to Edmunds and found this review of a lady totally dissatisfied with her x- type. I am sorry but I purchased a 04 with 40,000 miles for my wife and the car has been exceptional. Nothing but normal stuff...rear brakes. this lady who says it has been nothing but trouble must have received a Monday/Friday car and am truly sorry she cannot enjoy the luxury of a Jaguar. This is what Ford intended...to have a luxury car be affordable to the middle class. I am a GM fan, oh well can't win them all."
jaguar,x-type,2004,Fizzle, 06/10/2010,Great Car To Drive,4,Bought this from dealer as a demo with only 1600 miles. Car handles great and has never needed any major repairs. I am upgrading to the new XJ as a result of my wonderful experience with this model. X-type is an entry level Jag but if you want a car different from every other model on the road this is it. 
jaguar,x-type,2004,Jim, 06/14/2005,great car,5,"We didn't find the color or equipment we wanted at the dealer so he found one for us and actually, gave us a better deal on the one we now have than the ones he had on the lot.  We have every option except dynamic stability control.  It has proven to be quite a vehicle. While I hear the BMW's and Acura's are better buys, the Jaguar has a ""je ne sais quoi"" that the others don't and, there is an exclusivity about owning one. We have had no problems after almost 12,000 miles and it still has that like new feeling.  Fun to drive, a real head turner and overall we are quite happy with the car.  The all wheel drive has proven itself both in the winter and on the windy mountain roads of SW PA.     "
jaguar,x-type,2004,aperez301, 12/22/2003,A fine car,4,"The X-type 3.0 has been a pleasure to 
drive.  Although we have not had the 
car long enough to experience any 
maintinence intervals however the 
dealership experience blew us away.  
The car has good power although 
acceleration is hampered by the AWD.  
Downshifts under full throttle could be 
quicker but this is a ""touring car"" 
isn't it?  The interier is fabulous.  
It looks and feels richer than any of 
the other cars we considered (Mercedes, 
BMW, Saab, Volvo, Infiniti).  This car 
is well worth a serious look."

that this is Jag X/BMW 3 money. All the 
road test guys say buy BMW 3, and 
everybody does. Rather than be another 
mindless Bimmer driver, we chose Jag X-
type 3.0. Rides smooth, handles good. 
21 mpg so far. Stay away from sport

jaguar,x-type,2004,N., 02/12/2010,LEMON !!,1,My husband purchased this car for me for my 40th birthday. Not a day goes by without regret. It has been nothing short of disastrous. It has been in the shop 7 times for the same two problems: 1)grinding noise located in the right front 2) at about 35 mph the engine begins to vibrate - best description: feels like you are driving over a washboard. They actually REPLACED the engine and it still is not fixed.  The interior is falling apart. The lining surrounding the front and back windows is peeling off. The visor mirrors are broken. The back seat seat belts have broken. The glove box will not close properly. Electrical side mirror adjustment switch is faulty.  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!!  
jaguar,x-type,2004,Nick, 06/17/2008,Great Car!,4,I have done a lot of review prior to purchasing this car.  I have had a few in my day and this is by far the best car I have ever had.  Runs great and the handling is by far superior to anything I have driven.  The only thing I needed to do was replace the windshield wiper motor which was very very easy to do. Took all of 30 min. Very stylish for the money and fun to drive in any weather! My wife loves it way more then the Volvo S70 she had. Two thumbs up for me!!

are a nice looking car. I am not usually
one to complain, but I am going back to
Acura when this lease is up."
jaguar,x-type,2004,lydia , 05/02/2006,Outstanding Car,5,This has been a truly outstanding vehicle. We have 22000 miles without a single problem other than the tires wearing out very prematurely. Service has been outstanding. Fantastic in snow.

jaguar,x-type,2004,James, 09/12/2007,2004 Jaguar,4,"The odometer on my X-Type just turned 60k w/ no major problems to report. The car has had a loud squeal which appears to emanate from the underside of the car since the day I brought it home. The dealer told me it's normal, that all Jaguars make noise and the decibels are acceptable. A sound shield was installed to muffle the noise, but I still hear it. Aside from that, the dash vents popped off. The dealer replaced them, citing a defect in the plugs that secure them to the dashboard. Overall, the car is nice and is a pleasure to drive.  Relatively short money for a luxury vehicle. I'd likely buy another, but will make certain it doesn't squeal before I drive out of the dealership."
jaguar,x-type,2004,Sexy Cat, 02/01/2010,Wow and more WOW,4,This is one of the funnest and most sexy cars to drive I just fell in love. I was choosing between this and a Mazda 6 and hands down I am so happy I chose this car. It just makes ya feel like you are better than you really are and that is something you can't put a price on. I get out and just stare at it and have tripped on things from not watching where I am going. If you are EVER lucky enough to buy 1 DO IT!
jaguar,x-type,2004,K. johnson, 10/16/2017,Jaguar Xtype 2004,1,"I purchased this car as a pre-owned model. It was approximately 5-6 years old at the time. The aesthetics of the car is awesome. However, over the years ,I have found that although it is ""technically"" a jaguar, it is a cheaper model which has needed repair after repair. I rebuilt the transmission a few months ago.  Also antifreeze was getting low and I was not seeing any puddle under the car, so I took it to a mechanic, after the transmission rebuild. The whole part with the hoses had to be replaced(seal was leaking). so I had to get this replaced.  Now the engine light is on, so back to the shop. The engine is leaking oil, the drive belt needs to be replaced and on top of that I need to do normal maintenance (brakes, rotors, tires). This car is a nightmare. I know that it isn't new, but I take care of it, and only have 78,880 miles on it. I need a car and a new car right now is sort of out of the question. Over the years it seems like this car has required more than its fair share of repairs. If I could do it again, I would never have purchased this money trap. I believe this car was manufactured by Ford, so why are the parts so impossibly expensive? I can't wait to push this model off a cliff
"
jaguar,x-type,2004,Buddy, 12/23/2009,Piece of junk,1,"I bought this car brand new in 2004. I have only 35000 miles and this started giving me problems before even it reached 20,000 miles. I have spent over $2500 on repairs. Now I hear whining noise when I drive and my dealer says it needs all new hoses $2000. I must say quality of Jaguar is far worst than any other car in the market.  It's not worth $10,000 I can't believe I paid over $32,000 for this junk.  I would never ever buy any Jaguar ever."
jaguar,x-type,2004,Josh boyles, 12/09/2009,Awesome car!!,4,"I saw this car and fell in love with it. Love the awd and the sport button, fast. Great horsepower. My first jag and so far am very impressed, the awd is great and the pick up power is nice to have."
jaguar,x-type,2004,nopesa, 12/08/2003,If only there was a money back guarantee,3,"I bought the 3.0 Sport because it 
visually appealed to me and on test 
drive was smooth, fast and quiet. But 
after 2 months, the Sport package has 
proven too stiff, the gas mileage is 
worse than a SUV...consistently 
average 13-14 mpg. The driver's seat 
shakes. Buttons here and there squeak 
and the car just doesn't make itself a 
keeper. My old Lexus was light years 
smoother and more sophisticated than 
this Jag."
jaguar,x-type,2004,Bob, 01/02/2006,2004 XType - Very Disappointing,2,I have the 2004 X Type for a year and a half now and can't wait for the lease to be up. Both key remotes have broken at different times. Both headlights have gone out at different times. The wipers stopped working and had to be serviced with a new motor. The car now started emmitting a whining noise from the rear and now has to go back. The seats are very small and uncomfortable. The heated seats and rear defroster shut off at 15 minte intervals which is annoying. Horrible sounding stereo. Cup holders are made it appears for cups of British tea rather than water bottles. Rear seat is cramped. Great AWD in snow. Ample HP with 3.0 engine but nothing exciting. Hood ornament is best feature!

breakdown in the 1st week of 
ownership, a acceleration hesitation 
in cold weather, fuel door 
malfunctions (couldn't get it open), 
lock malfunctions (including being 
both locked out and locked IN the 
car), navigation system malfunctions 
and computer malfunctions.  Beyond 
that, the car spent 10 weeks(!) in the 
body shop to repair minor cosmetic 
damage due to backordered parts.

imagine a better value for the money 
(luxury car with leather, wood 
interior, AWD, sunroof, climate 
control, etc.) thanks to the marketing 
incentive. The styling is superior and 
the car turns heads.  Who would buy a 
Honda Accord for $25K when you can but 
a loaded Jag for a few thousand more?  
Qaulity is very good so far.  Drive is 
pleasing.  It seats four average sized

jaguar,x-type,2004,Steve C, 12/19/2004,Nice Car,4,"I don't see how anyone could really 
complain about this little Jaguar.  The 
engine has good power. The all wheel 
drive makes the car handle well.  It 
has every feature you would reasonably 
use or need in a car.  

It has it's own personality which makes 
it feel different from other cars. I 
like the wood shift knob and lack of a 
button you have to push down to get the 
shift out of park.  I even like the 
hand break between the seats.

I read a review that said the engine 
lacks torque.  The cars goes 0 to 60 in 
7 seconds and has a top speed of near 
140 miles an hour. The engine can't be 
that weak."
jaguar,x-type,2004,Axiomlover, 12/28/2004,Unbelievable Deal,5,"At the year-end closing prices, this 
vehicle was impossible to pass. 
Interior is put together very, very 
well, just as any luxury vehicle should 
be. The 2.5 manual has a healthy 
accelaration and is very quiet. The 
road feel is typical of a European 
sedan and cornering is outstanding. The 
AWD makes you forget about snow, rain 
and gravel. The manual takes some 
getting used to, especially shifts from 
first to second.  It is not a large 
car, especially in the back, but the 
trunk is larger than most competitors. 
I am looking forward to many months or 
years of fun every time I put the key 
in the ignition."

I am willing to pay for the correction, if need be."
jaguar,x-type,2004,Peter, 02/24/2005,2004 Jaguar X-Type,4,"Nicest car I have ever driven, fun to drive (other reviews say underpowered,I say not unless you have to have >200hp to enjoy, and don't mind the coresponding gas guzzling). AWD is excellent, be even better if it was 50/50.  Decent mileage, and runs fine on regular gas.  Very comfy, except over bumpy roads I drive, stiff like a Subaru Outback, hopefully means suspension will last longer.  So far (15K) excellent realiability, Ford engine is way better made than Jags used to be reliability-wise (my '79 X-J6 was a mechanical nightmare). Lastly at $23.3K new for manual/black, it beat Audi price by $10K, can't beat it."
jaguar,x-type,2004,Alan , 03/11/2005,Hard to beat the X-type,4,"I have put 4000 trouble free miles on this new Jag and the smiles get bigger every day.  This car is classy, quiet and a ball to drive.  Been in snow and ice and its as sure footed as any car I've ever driven.  Plenty of power and tight as a drum.  I looked at the I35 and BMW but the value and exclusivity of the Jag made it a no brainer.  I have been getting 24mpg on the car and that could be better and premium gas is a bit of a pain, but overall, this is a great car at a great price and you don't see yourself coming the other way every 2 minutes.  Great Car"

In the two years that we have owned this car it has been in the shop 25 times. Rattles and noises have been endless.  Many have been fixed just to come back again.  We put on our third set of tires at 55,000 miles.  Remote locks have been fixed 4 times.  Dashboard has popped up 4 times and currently rattling again.  Electric windows broke, wheel covers fell off, seatbelts jammed, wind leak in windows, door jammed from outside, Grinding/rubbing noise when stopping. Rattles everywhere!  Looks nice but grrrrr!  I will do more investigating next time I buy."
jaguar,x-type,2004,Bryan, 01/02/2007,First Jaguar,4,"I am very happy with this car.  I believe it offers a lot for the price and am glad I bought it. It is small, nimble and responsive enough to be fun to drive.  Yet it is big enough to have   room for four people. The fold down rear seat together with a decent sized trunk provide good luggage carrying capacity as well. The gas mileage is good especially in view of its performance. The all wheel drive has been a comfort in winter driving.  I have had no mechanical or quality problems with it. All in all an excellent ownership experience."
jaguar,x-type,2004,William Shepherd, 01/09/2007,Jag's got it RIGHT!!,4,I bought this car for my wife and she loves it. I had reservations due to the negative Jaguar mechanical image it had in the past but let me tell you that this Jag is awesome! The all wheel drive is incredible. The power in the V6 3.0 will put you in your seat. We now love it.
jaguar,x-type,2004,P Medina, 01/17/2007,Best certified car out there,4,I just purchased this 2004 Jaguar X- type and so far I love this car. I was looking for a nice affordable luxury car and decided to check out Jaguar. I was very impressed with the style of the car. The interior is very nice and comfortable with all of the options a nice luxury car should have. I love driving a 5 spd and love that the x- type has it. I can not wait to test the awd in the bad weather. I have had the car for a short period of time but love it so far. 
jaguar,x-type,2004,Frank K, 01/20/2007,Great Cat,4,"Great value. I know this is a Ford based car, but the value is great. The ride is firm and yet comfortable. Huge trunk. No issues, recalls and free maintenance!!"
jaguar,x-type,2004,SouthCarolinaGuy, 02/21/2007,Nice car for the price,4,"I've leased this car for the past 39 months. I love the styling, smooth ride. The AWD just hugs the road. Turning, parking,etc. all great. I feel safe driving this car. Great visibility all around. I have not been pleased with the workmanship. My dash vents have popped up, the cloth covering on the roof support along the windsheld is wrinkling, the lighted mirror on the passenger visor won't stay up - flops down when opened. The covering for the driver-side rear view mirror disappeared - assume it just fell off. The oil pan gasket had a leak that was repaired under warranty. Back seat is tight, but I rarely have passengers there."
jaguar,x-type,2004,Massachusetts Driver, 04/29/2007,Very Nice Used Purchase,5,"I recently purchased a 2004 jaguar x type. It runs great and is incredibly roomy. The trunk is huge and the rear seats fold down for skis, and other large objects in the trunk. I paid $18,300 for a 2004 (3 years old) and am happy with my deal. The car is quiet, comfortable and fast. I also have been averaging close to 25 MPG on the highway. I have checked out the BMWs and find as new and used cars they are very expensive. The Jag offers a less harsh ride, and a far more economical used purchase. All amenities work well, and the car is really a value. It also offers a slightly more individualistic and eccentric statement than the BMW."
jaguar,x-type,2004,Peter C., 06/06/2007,OK but Reliability Issues a Concern,3,"I did tons of research when I purchased this car.  Bought for ridiculously cheap price.  All and all drives nice, on par with other entry level luxury vehicles.  Many issues have popped up including replacement of propshaft, faulty seat heater, grinding noise when braking, faulty sunroof (had to be fixed twice).  For price I paid, and magnitude of repairs (small but annoying) I am not unhappy but if I had to do it again, I would probably have purchased the Volvo S-60 instead."
jaguar,x-type,2004,Edward , 03/17/2008,It's a comfortable drive,4,"Especially in the snow when the all wheel drive makes you feel like your driving a little tank. This is complemented by a very nice interior design. The low profile tires, however, are not very good because I have to avoid potholes. I wouldn¬ít mind the gas mileage if I didn¬ít have to drive 120 miles a day."
jaguar,x-type,2004,Mike V, 05/21/2008,First Jaguar,5,"This is our first Jaguar, Purchased it with only 14580 miles on it, Select edition certified. Have already put 2500 miles on the car and it is awesome! Fast, responsive, and good looking. The J shifter is fun, wood inside is looks great, I'm a big guy and the seats are great, I spent many years driving a land rover and supportin OPEC, I get almost twice the MPG, I average 27 MPG on the highway and about 22 in the city. Jaguar is great! I'm hooked!"
jaguar,x-type,2004,John in PA, 10/23/2019,This is a ridiculously under-rated sleeper,5,"So many of the professional reviewers have complained that the X-Type was Jaguar's low-point.  They complain that it's a Ford Countour/Mondeo underneath.  Here's the problem with that reasoning:  other than being ""common"" there wasn't anything wrong with the Ford.  Jaguar took a good car, gave it all wheel drive, a 3 Liter V-6, and a body by Geoff Lawson, which made it an excellent car.  It's fast (much faster than one would guess looking at it - topping out around 145), it's quiet, it does very well on corners and in the snow, it has a large trunk, and it's comfortable for 4 adults.  And now 15 years later these are dirt cheap - frequently under $5,000 on used car lots for a decent one - why buy a Subaru when you can have a Jag for less?  Mostly they're easy to service, your local mechanic can handle 95% of the problems.  My only complaint is that last 5% that has to be dealt with by a Jaguar dealer are very expensive and Jaguar-specific parts can be slow to arrive. In other words, the car is excellent, it's Jaguar that's the problem.

jaguar,x-type,2004,Tbirdtony, 04/23/2006,2004 Jaguar X-Type AWD - Great Car,4,"I bought a new 2003 Acura 3.2 TL when I decided to purchase an entry level luxury car.  After 1 year I traded it for the 2004 Jaguar.  Driving the Acura was like owning a Honda Accord.  The Acura had paper thin sheet metal, a fair interior, and I received 2 recalls on the engine & transmission.  After 2 years of owning the 2004 Jaguar I am still impressed.  Great build quality, great interior, good power, great AWD, and no problems or recalls.  The Jaguar dealer provides great service on the FREE scheduled maintenance.  This is a great entry level luxury car."

jaguar,x-type,2004,uab9253, 01/19/2010,5 years in and I still love it!,4,"I bought mine new in December 2004 and I still love this car. I have had 50000 relatively trouble free miles.  I have only had bulbs, battery, fluids replaced - just got a rear brake job. Like another reviewer, I switched from Continental to Fuzion tires - they seem to be holding up much better and look good too. I also have the cloth wrinkling along the supports on each side of the windshield.  This car has never left me, embarrassed me or sent me to the shop.  I only just now have to pay for service- Dealer prices were a shock. I've probably gone there for the last time - minor stuff I'll have done at a local garage.  Glorified oil change at 50K ""Service"" miles was $500."
jaguar,x-type,2004,longhorn57, 06/05/2008,Working better than I thought!,4,"Bought my Jag with 23k miles in June 07.  After I bought it, I read all these horror stories about how awful the car was.  Well, so far, after one whole year, it's really been fine.  It's very fun to drive, looks extremely attractive, has some nice pep, and the gas mileage is OK.  Just keeping my fingers crossed that the car continues to operate reliability.  So far, so good!  "
jaguar,x-type,2004,Dissapointed, 09/16/2008,Forget about the manual transmission,3,"I had a 5 speed 2004 X type, the styling, suspension and handling are Ok.  The engine not very economical, but OK, needing 91 octane.  My 5 speed gear shifting action was Ok, but the clutch was awful, and after only 20K miles the rear differential was clunking badly.  The dealership changed the clutch, and I got to see the old unit - a terrible design.  Lots of plastic pieces also broke. Happy to get rid of the car - I now buy Japanese."
jaguar,x-type,2004,Blown306, 10/30/2008,Don't get stuck with one,2,"We've had our X-Type 3.0 Sport for about three years and it has been one of the sorriest cars we ever bought.  In 60k miles, the car is on it's fourth set of tires, fifth set of defrost vents, second set of visors and 3 three rims have been replaced, one because it had to be chiseled off (stuck $14/ea lug nuts caused it).  It leaks oil, makes tons of various noises and gets horrible mileage.  It can take off and turn good in the snow, but forget about stopping.  30 days after a $200 alignment from Jag and new tires on the front, the wear indicators on the inner edges are gone! Look at something out of Germany instead... trading this in on a Jetta diesel.  "
jaguar,x-type,2004,Chief, 12/30/2009,Kitty Corners,4,I found a steal on a 2004 2.5 X-type with only 21k mileage.  I couldn't resist at the under 10k price despite their maintenance reputation.  I was shocked at how well it handles and with the 5 speed and 200 horses it can be driven like the cat it is.  I'm sure the 3.0 or the 430 horse versions are nice improvements.  Being in the NW I appreciate the AWD in the snow but the torquey nature of the car will set you sliding if you're not careful.  Not an Outback for sure but it looks hotter! 
jaguar,x-type,2004,BoroBulldogs, 09/30/2010,Great Car but not from Cherry Hill NJ,3,"My Jaguar 2004 x-type has been a reliable vehicle as far as the powertrain is concerned.  It is a great performing car that handles turns with tremendous agility.  However, there is a defect with the interior design- specifically the interior peeling from around the windshield and back window.  This is documented in many places on the internet.  Please check the interior edges in these locations before making your purchase and be wary of what dealership you choose to deal with.  When our original dealership closed in Mays Landing NJ we were forced to do business with Cherry Hill Classic Cars in NJ, which I strongly advise you to STEER CLEAR of as they turned the deaf ear on this defect!"
jaguar,x-type,2004,billgerry, 01/09/2005,it needs a little work,3,"The X is a truly fabulous car to drive. It handles curves like a champ, and at 120 mph, it still has power to spare. It was annoying to have the transmission replaced at 20k - with 5 others in the shop ahead of mine.  Cheap plastic items, like gas cap covers break easily, and a number of electronic problems, like sunroof controls, keep cropping up, requiring the inconvenience of shop visits."
jaguar,x-type,2004,damndominicana91, 10/04/2003,Jaguar,5,"This is a great car. It's like there's

a Jaguar"
jaguar,x-type,2004,Alan, 01/09/2005,First Class Luxury Car,5,"This car is outstanding.  All wheel drive, luxury and a beautiful body.  Handles great, gets 26 mpg, has enough power to be interesting.  If you're looking for a good looking sporty luxury cruiser, that won't be confused with some other car, this is the one.  If you want a pocket rocket that looks more common, look at the others."
jaguar,x-type,2004,Jag person, 01/12/2005,Better than led to believe,4,"After reading the negative on-line reviews from professionals, I held my breath after buying my Jaguar. Perhaps because of low expectations, I was and continue to be delighted by my driving and ownership experience. I'm not sure who reviewers think is driving BMWs and Audis and Mercedes, but the average driver is going to get plenty of performance from an X-type. I am a driving enthusiast who drives cars hard. If I had any more speed or handling than my Jag provides, I would probably have a fistful of speeding tickets. I sincerely doubt that drivers of the other sports sedans use the difference in performance that I will admit is probably there. And as for cachet, just try to beat a Jaguar!"
jaguar,x-type,2004,Jaguarantony, 10/11/2003,The awesome Jaguar,5,"The new Jaguar X-type is an excellent 
vehicle. The car is very Jaguar. It 
handles and corners very well. A great 
deal of people dont know enough about 
Jaguar. The 3.0 V-6 is very quick, 0-60 
in about 6.6-6.8 seconds,  I have the 
2.5 with a manual,and this is their 
base model car. Jaguar's fastest car is 
the XJR. It is rated at 0-60 time of 
5.0 seconds. As for the interior of the 
X-type,it has gorgeous wood maple 
veneer,and beautiful Rolls Royce like 
interior. The critics are overly too 
critical of the X-type."

Outstanding looks, good performance, improving gas mileage with age (now up to 26 Hwy), and a level of exclusivity that you don't find in the competitors.   Great in the snow and ice, handles great and is smooth and quiet.  Great leather interior.  If you can get your hands on one of these cars, go for it.  The best kept secret in cars."

on the jaguar. i finally reached my 
decision based on looks and overall 
performance. the 227 horsepower is very 
responsive and the engine sounds 
beautiful when called upon. there are 
safety features galore, 6 very smart 
airbags. my daughter can sit in the 
front seat in a pinch and it shuts off 
automatically because of her weight. 
the car is much more than i 
expected.plus it looks great in my 
driveway!!"
jaguar,x-type,2004,Abdoman, 03/31/2005,Good deal for the money,4,"My car has the sport package.  Never really liked Jaguar before, but this car has really grown on me.  Very good power, but the torque curve is too peakey - the real power is in the 3-4k range which kills gas mileage.  The engine is the real downfall of this car. Don't get me wrong 0-60 in 6.6s is good.     Handles very well and looks very good. Clutch is a little tricky, very good brakes."
jaguar,x-type,2004,Steve, 04/10/2005,04 X-type,4,"We love going on trips to the Maryland shore and find it very enjoyable in this car. My wife drives it about 300 miles every week with her job and finds it very reliable and fun to drive. The all wheel drive gives her a lot of confidence through the winter weather, she prefers driving it over the 4WD Ford Explorer in the snow and especially on wet roads."
jaguar,x-type,2004,Trenton Critic, 11/05/2003,The critics aren't always right.,4,"Critics are pretty tough on this car 
but I disagree.  The car is beautifully 
styled. The interior looks great.  The 
seats are extremely comfortable.  The 
wood trim is gorgeous and the controls 
are generally easy and intuitive. The 
engine is powerful enough particularly 
with the manual.Brakes are powerful, 
handling is balanced and precise.  All 
wheel drive is a definite plus-no 
slipping, skidding or torque steer.  
Unfortunately, there are still some 
quality control issues.  The shifter 
cables had to be replaced due to very 
sloppy shift quality. Also the clutch 
is difficult to modulate and too 
abrupt. Overall tho', this is an 
excellent car at the right price."
jaguar,x-type,2004,MXRIDER, 11/07/2003,Best car ive had,4,"Great car, inside and out.  Sporty 
exterior, and user friendly interior.  
Relatively smooth ride with great 
handling and respoinsiveness, and the 
engine has plenty of ""get up and go"" 
considering the size of the engine.  
However, a faulty thermostat and faulty 
cooling fan regulator have both left me 
waiting for flat bed :( .  In both 
cases, the warrantee  covered all 
repairs and labor charges.  Another 
drawback, the stock sound system is 
very weak for a Jag, I was very 
dissapointed.  Overall, I LOVE THIS

The dashboard defrost vents, cracking leatherette (handbrake and 5- speed shifter cover) are a few issues that have been rectified under warranty.  The interior is tight, consistent with Jaguar lineage.  The sports seats are the best of their kind, and will hold you in better than glue.  To that effect, they are not for the obese or overweight.   Well balanced handling, a bit of a long clutch for the 5-speed manual, but a very fun car to drive, and a definite improvement over my last Mercedes.  Great price, too."

the road, the steering rack had to be

replaced.  The clear coat paint was 
defective and begin developing air 
bubbles, had to be repainted. At a stop 
light once, the clamp for the hoses 
broke, all fluids drained, the car had 
to be towed. Engine does not always 
seem to have full power.  Recently I 
was made aware that the Chasis on the

nice and interior fit/finish is 
excellent. The only criticism to offer 
relates to mileage (it could be better 
for a compact), but in the near luxury

New transmission at 2600m. Problem

Whirring sound at low speeds annoying 
and alarming.
Back seats cramped and headroom very 
limited. Gas mileage awful at average 
17mpg, not what Jaguar wants you to 
believe. Trunk space about half of that 
in our 99 Acura TL. Mini spare tire did 
not improve my opinion of Jaguar. 
Great snow car! All wheel drive 
works well, sticky tires seem to claw 
their way through snow up to 18 inches. 
On icy hills we passed sliding SUV's 
BMW's and Mercedeses, as they were

my 2002 X-Type that the car is a much 
better 36K car than a 40K car. 
Secondly, fit and finish HAVE improved 
immeasurably, yet, I believe there is 
still some need to improve. Thirdly, 
for some reason the ride and handling 
are a bit ""off"" from the 2002 car,

As with all smaller, sportier cars, you 
will feel every bump in the road.  But 
it's handling performance on the 
highway and around turns is great.  I'm 
sure the ""luxury"" cars (which I think

 I purchased a red 
(Radiance) Xtype 3.0 in the spring of 
2004. With the Premium package, the 
Jag looked and felt better than the 
Benz. Gas mileage was not as bad as 
some have reported.  Local overall gas 
mileage is around 22 mpg. With a hefty 
price increase on the Benz, the cost 
was favorable. The four year bumper to 
bumper warranty was an asset also. The 
new Benz no longer offers the bumper

winter I started down the lane and 
realized I had forgotten something.  I 
put the car in reverse, and while on 
ice and snow, the car went backward 
without hesitation up a hill and around 
curves.  I was amazed!  Most cars can't

Excellent vehicle with a significant
offering of luxury, for a very
impressive  price. The Sport package
adds nice, tight handling. The interior
is gorgeous, and the seats are extremely
comfortable. The auto climate control is
easy to operate, and keeps the cabin
quite pleasant. The Engine could be a
tad beefier. The 320-watt sound system,
gets rather distorted at higher volumes,
and the subwoofer lacks ""punch"". Shift
pattern is very smooth, but the ""sport""
mode seems to offer little value, or
shift change. Sport package affords an
array of bigger, nicer wheels."

The small V6 works fine especially with 
the price of gas going up.

There is a bit of ""over steer"" with the 
front wheel drive but, I live in the 
city and can't go racing around.

The car has a solid handling feel and 
downshifts when power is needed.

The A/C works great even with the V6.

This model works well for my needs."
jaguar,x-type,2004,C.B. Hoffman, 09/07/2004,It's a real Jaguar!,4,"For those who have dreamed about owning
a Jaguar but found it out their reach,
the 2.5L x -type is the right place to
start.

I found road handling excellent, and the
car responds well, both on curves and on
the straightaway. The AWD is
really good in the snow.

The five speed transmission handles
well, but drivers should remember that
the clutch-gas-clutch-gas syndrome in
heavy traffic takes some getting used to.

But the best thing about the Jaguar is
what is what has been its trademark
since the beginning: It's beautiful.
Mine is British racing green, and people
actually stop and stare at the car, both
in traffic and when it's parked. "
jaguar,x-type,2004,MK6331, 09/13/2004,Base is the Case,4,"I just had this car in for it's 30k 
service and have not had 1 problem 
since I took delivery. I did not choose 
the sport ed. because the seats were 
just not comfortable. The shift between 
1st and 2nd is a bit notchy but after 
driving it for awhile, I've learned to 
rev the engine to about 4k rpm before 
shifting and it seems much better. Yes, 
it could use a little more horsepower 
but it's still a spirited performer and 
absolutely stable in bad weather. At 
this point, once the lease is up, I'm 
planning to buy it."
jaguar,x-type,2004,Chef David, 09/14/2004,X Type 3.0,5,"The pretige and appearance of Jaguar is 
the best of all cars. ""Wow!"" was the

relatives. I love the luxurious feeling 
of driving it. "
jaguar,x-type,2004,oc, 09/19/2004,Nice,5,"I got a really good deal on this, so 
it's hard not to like (25k).  They were 
getting rid of them for the 2005s - 
right place right time kinda thing.  
What's not to like when you get a car 
like this for a price like that.  Even 
if I paid 30 to 32 for it, that's what 
this car feels like driving.  I like it 
a lot more than the Mercedes.  
Something about jag that puts it 
apart.  The car is heavy/solid feeling, 
but I'm taking turns at more than twice 
the speed of the sequoa (truck) and I 
don't even notice it.  The interior is 
absolutely gorgeous - a very non-
cluttered open feel, but while your 
sitting in there sitting just off the 
ground, it's like a race car"
jaguar,x-type,2004,KarlJohnson, 09/16/2004,Forget about everything you ever knew...,5,"This car is tremendous and leaves 
everything that I've ever thought 
about Jaguar quality at the door.  
I'll keep everyone posted but the last 
4,000 miles have been exiting and the 
car handles like a dream.  This is AWD 
and you will not find that in any car 
in its class (for this price).  The 
car has a terrific sound system and 
the Nav system is awesome.  I actually 
look forward to driving in it as the 
same day it was purchased.  You owe it 
to yourself to at least test drive one!"
jaguar,x-type,2004,Rhode Island, 09/25/2004,baby jaguar,4,"The little jaguar does everything you 
ask it to do and is a lot of fun to 
drive to boot.

Handles great with the all wheel drive 
yet gives a pretty good ride. 

The longer you own it the better you 
like the car. It is not flashy but 
understated.  I think people who don't 
own one just don't understand."

That's it.  What a deal.  This car has 
lots of spunk and its shifter and 
steering is as nice as my Miata.  
Beautiful looks with its British racing 
green color, loads of fun, and the 
prestige of Jaguar!  Now whenever I 
drive to and from work I have a smile 
on my face when I put the key in the

jaguar,x-type,2005,skargo, 03/14/2013,There is absolutely NOTHING in the world like driving a Jag,4,"I bought this car used 6 months ago and I still hate the fact that pulling in my driveway means that my drive has ended! I look forward to getting into the car every morning and looking down the amazing curves of the hood to follow my chrome cat to work. The car handles like a sports car. You can do the sharpest turns and curves at the highest speeds and the car doesn't flinch. It is small but comfortably room in the front - I can't say as much for the back - it's kind of cramped...but I will only ever be sitting behind the wheel of this car! You are surrounded by wood, leather, and an amazing Alpine sound system...who could ask for more!"
jaguar,x-type,2005,Jag, 08/28/2008,Amazing - get a 2005 or newer!,5,"Love the car, I researched the car before purchase, saw that 2001-03 had some problems, Jaguars Quality Initiative 04 put over 1000 new components in this car. My 2005 is awesome. Great driving experience, curves and hills are my favorite, AWD will be a blessing this winter. Luxury interior leaves you feeling like and people thinking that you paid a fortune for this car. "
jaguar,x-type,2005,S. Chapman, 02/26/2009,Good value but has drawbacks,3,Bought this car as it had excellent value for resale and was AWD - others tested were the Audi A4 & Volvo S60 - the Jag just seemed like a better value for $$$ - the 3L V6 engine delivers smooth cruising power but has enough pickup punch to pass slower trucks/traffic on the highway.  The AWD is great in poor weather and snow (make sure you check to see if its equipped with Traction control - mine was not and feels somewhat like a RWD car in heavy snow - light tail end). Also the name brand: Jaguar - it has a lengthy pedigree and the car is not very common on the road - unlike other executive BMW's & Audi's - which seem to be everywhere.
jaguar,x-type,2005,Lymeboy, 11/02/2009,Jaaaaaag Wagon,4,"I have driven mostly BMW's for the past 20 years.  I purchased this 05 Jaguar Sportwagon in July 07 and I am delighted with the design, build quality, aesthetics, and driving dynamics.  It can not be compared to BMW, MB, Audi, etc., as it is British, not German.  The wagon is elegant inside and out, it is comfortable for a guy with back problems.  I have only seen one other Jag Wagon in the state of Maine---I do not see myself coming and going."
jaguar,x-type,2005,Colonel D., 05/17/2017,Best car I ever owned,5,"Every popular magazine and website dissed the Jag wagon when it came out.  Boy, were they wrong.  I bought mine used, have owned it for eight years, and NEVER had a major maintenance issue with it. Performance is tops, just like the day I got it, and it now has 130k miles. Small and nimble, but with the extra room of a wagon and every extra you can imagine. Sweet ride. Car & Driver called it an ""exotic"" since less than about 1500 were made between 2004 and 2008. They were right about one thing: it's a head-turner and a conversation starter with knowledgeable Jag owners.  If Jag still made these, it would be my next car.

jaguar,x-type,2005,Venessa, 02/16/2009,The Jag,4,"The Jaguar x-type vdp edition is my 3rd vehicle that I've owned and by far the most fun and luxurious vehicle.  I get so many compliments on it, and people think that I've paid a fortune. Luckily, I got a great deal for an awesome product.  I've heard some negative things about Jaguar and so far I have not experienced any of them and I've had the car for almost 6 months.  I don't know how anyone can see this car doesn't compare to the BMW 3 series or Mercedes C Class.  This car definitely has a lot going for it plus more.  I don't regret this purchase at all.    "

#4 the led light that allows view of temperature numbers is out and cannot be repaired easily 

I see many of these vehicles still on the road here in Coastal Southern California 
I know that this car is fast ""like a Jaguar"".....it is fun to drive ""like a Jaguar"" it has unique style and grace,""like a Jaguar
We  are glad that Jaguar has re-introduced the SportBrake "" (as they call it in England) 
We wanted to order a new Sportbrake, however,we are looking at the F-pace because this Sportbrake-Wagon 
rides low to the ground and a few inches of taller ride would help us navigate the gauntlet of distracted drivers in Coastal Socal

We might be selling soon

jaguar,x-type,2005,Michael in Iowa, 08/15/2008,Great Deal,4,"I'm 65.  This is my 17th car and the first that's more than basic transportation.  I have the basic X- type with no options:  manual transmission and the small engine.  To me, given a same-price choice between the X-type and a mid-level Accord or Camry is a no-brainer. The Accord and Camry are larger, but the X-type just lovely.  It's beautifully equipped and a pleasure to drive.  It seems powerful and sporty. Gas mileage, 19/28, is good for an all wheel drive car with 192 HP, and the shifter is the smoothest I've ever worked.  I'd buy another."
jaguar,x-type,2005,mr riley, 10/14/2004,2004 x type,4,"All wheel drive fully loaded for in the

jaguar,x-type,2005,Mike C., 03/18/2005,I like the X,5,"I have been very pleased with the Jaguar X type. The ride, handling, and power are excellent. I like the styling - Interior and exterior. I love the wood. Friends that have the entry level German rivals (MB, BMW, Audi) have been impressed when riding in the car. I would not trade it for a comparably priced German rival. Just riding in it has converted a few friends. During the winter - I couldn't ""make it"" slide in the snow - Great road manners. I have had ZERO reliability problems. "
jaguar,x-type,2005,fasteddiefromLI, 04/22/2005,True sports sedan,4,"Handles nearly as well as the Infinity G35, but better looking and a more luxury looking interior.  Not as many luxury and comfort features as the Acura TL but much, much more fun to drive.  Better handling and better all around than the new Maxima.  A very good sports sedan for the money."
jaguar,x-type,2005,Tedd, 06/08/2005,The grin still hasen't left my face!,5,"What a great car!  I just finished driving the X type from Kansas City to L.A. I ventured off the interstate often and hit some great winding mountain road (pine to palms hwy) and even went off road into (yes, into!) the grand canyon on a gravel road/creek bed!  Went from rain and snow (in Flagstaff) to desert heat. The car was loaded down to the hilt, driven hard, thrown into corners, cruised at high speed, and every component performed perfectly! (except the rearview mirror vibrated out of position on the rough gravel road leading into the grand canyon) I never had a more fun drive!  BMW should be worried!  "
jaguar,x-type,2005,Gonzales, 06/07/2005,Jag X,5,"The X-Type is a Jaguar in every sense, especially in the one important one: you feel good every time you sit in it, feel the leather, see the wood and chrome, the curves of the bonnet, and feel the way it performs. A delight."
jaguar,x-type,2005,KKear, 02/18/2005,Interior pieces not up to par,4,"Have the car just over a year. The sales experience was great but the servicing of the car is a problem. Every 5000 miles it goes in for oil change and a a list of interior problems that take 2 days to fix. The defroster vents, J gate shifter, seat belt height adjuster, floor mats, outside temp guage and bulbs burning out all are problem areas. Good thing the car is a great driver, has stunning looks and has a long warantee. Fuel mileage is 22.2 MPG over 16000 miles, about right for AWD and high compression, high horse engine."

jaguar,x-type,2005,Nice Jag, 04/18/2006,2005 X-TYPE 3.0 VDP Edition,4,Nice comfortable ride.  Love the interior leather and the exterior styling on my VDP edition. Decent acceleration but not mind blowing off the line. I expect the manual would be a bit more fun.  Roomy in the front and the back seat is par for the course.  Nice build quality and has a large trunk.  Alpine stereo is ok but the bass needs a little more depth at least for my ears. Seem to be getting 20.9 mpg but I have a heavy foot. AWD is nice -corners ok but does feel a little loose at higher speeds but hey this isn't a sports car. The local Jag service department seems very helpful. I am really enjoying this car and getting a lot of compliments on the interior and exterior styling!
jaguar,x-type,2005,Andy, 12/28/2006,2005 X-type VDP,4,Overall I am very pleased with my experience with the car.  The styling is exquisite and the interior elegance is above its competitors.  The car has plenty of power (3L V6 engine) to make my driving fun and leave a fair amount of cars behind.
jaguar,x-type,2005,Keith , 02/18/2007,Fun to Drive,4,I had never considered buying a Jag until I happened to test drive one while my wife was looking for a new car. It took me by surprise how much fun I had driving the 2.5 5 speed manual. Yes the car is not perfect but I think it holds its own against the BMW 3 and Merz C. I haven't had this much fun driving a car since I was a 16 year old with a Camaro. New X-types are a little pricey but a good value can be found with a Certified Pre-owned Jaguar. I ended up buying a 3.0 auto with the sport package. I miss shifting gears but still have more fun than I thought was possible driving a sedan. After 3 months I'm still happy I bought the car
jaguar,x-type,2005,Marybeth, 04/29/2005,Lemon to Lime,3,"I have had 2 X Types. My first one was an actual lemon, and Jag gave me a new one. This one also drops gears at 35- 40mph and has a heavy steering wheel shimmy, as the ""Lemon"" did. It is performing about 50% better. Jag has been good about fixing things thus far, let's see how fast I sell it once it hits its 30K mark. Do I like Jags, yes.. mostly a smooth ride, and I like the look. Could it perform better and get better mileage, you bet. "
jaguar,x-type,2005,Sancho, 02/22/2005,My Jag,4,Vehicle was delivered with grossly over-inflated tires (50lbs) ... should be approx 30lbs.  Have a standard transmission; am a conservative driver; have yet to get over 22 mpg combined city/highway driving.  Car handles great; takes turns smoothly and requires minimur of braking on sharp turns.  Excellent on snow and rain. Developed a high-pitched sound; failed to repair correctly on first try; tape recorded sound and the Dealer replaced the DRIVETRAIN... have not heard sound in approx one month since this repair.
jaguar,x-type,2005,Nicolas, 11/25/2005,Excellent but needs minor improvements,4,"My 2004 X TYPE driven only 3400 miles since new has a little noise or click when it engages the AWD and the transmission at speeds lower than 30 MPH, It is similar to the noises in the old cardan shafts system and crosses attaching the transmission and the differential of american cars. The dealer revised the noise and the AWD system but found ""nothing wrong"".  It is very difficult to read the trip computer window due to daylight glare. No problem during night time."
jaguar,x-type,2005,Todd, 08/14/2005,What A Disaster!,2,"Please!  I beg you to think twice before buying an X type.  I have had it for 3 months... and it has been nothing but a disaster!  The remotes don't work, the gas tank does not open!!  The windows are constantly breaking and get stuck in one position.  The plastic buttons on the inside break off!!!  Stay as far away as you can!!!!"
jaguar,x-type,2005,Meyer, 12/04/2004,Great Car,4,"This is a great car.  You must get used to the small size, but it is easy to handle.  Has a small gas tank so you fill up more often.  Jag pays for some of the oil changes, up to 40,000 miles."
jaguar,x-type,2005,Muggsc, 02/23/2005,My second Jag,4,"My first JAG was an XJ8, I really wanted an  S-Model, however I did not like the grill.  I also think the interior of the X-type is just as nice as the S-type, except for the steering wheel, which I have ordered the wood grain finished one from the dealer. The only thing that I don't like is that the rear seating leg area is too short.   Overall the car is as sweet as they get."

jaguar,x-type,2005,Mike, 11/02/2006,Great Value,4,This car has not only been fun to drive but a great value as well. The trunk is huge. However the back seat is very tight with limited legroom and headroom for passengers and somewhat difficult to enter/exit.  
jaguar,x-type,2005,np, 12/27/2005,Good value for the money,4,"Got the car at the end of the year.  Saved the first year's depreciation. It is more agile than the 99 bmw 528 I had.  Gas mileage is not quite as good so far, about 23mpg.  Interior is exceptionally nice. Exterior is also exceptional.  Engine could use another 15-20 hp but not bad. No issues so far. Handling is not quite as good as a bmw 325, but for every day use it works great. "

Only a few simple problems such a a malfunctioning trunk lock and some recall service... all covered under warranty plus the dealer provided a free Jaguar rental car.  My new car is just a beautiful and I am leasing for a similar price to my 2002 model!  Glad I did not have to downsize!  The best feature is the AWD!  I live in WI and we get bad snow and ice... this car's wheels NEVER spin!  Grips the road!  Love it!  
jaguar,x-type,2005,BETSY ZACK, 02/13/2005,FIRST JAGUAR,4,I am enjoying my new jaguar - I am very happy they decided to build a wagon. It is fun to drive and there is a generous cargo area in the back for anything from groceries to small furniture finds. My son thinks a Jaguar should only be a luxury sports car but what could be wrong with a sporty wagon that is pretty to look at?

Wow! What a difference.  I just love to drive it.  It's exciting to both drive and look at.  Jag addressed all the little quirks I had in the 2002.  Great job Jaguar! World class fit and finish. I can also fit three sets of golf clubs inside walking bags in the trunk."

absolutely beautiful to look at inside 
and out and a joy to drive.  The build 
quality is excellent.  Jaguar doesn't 
make extensive changes to their 
vehicles from year to year but simply 
improves the model, learning from the 
past.  It's AWD system results in a 
vehicle that exhibites excellent 
handling on any road condition. The 
engine is deceptively powerfull.  It 
is not the quickest from a dead stop 
(drag racing!), but has excellent pull 
from 30-100 mph, which is where most 
of my driving occurs.  But if you want 
of pocket rocket you shouldn't be 
looking at a Jaguar and should 
consider a Dodge SRT-4 or maybe a BMW 
330."
jaguar,x-type,2005,DonS2, 01/21/2005,Great Car for the Money!,4,"I purchased a 2004 leftover for $22.8k. It was a base car w/ a five speed manual.  A lot of bang for the buck.  It would be hard to find something in the same price range w/ all wheel dive, V6, leather and full power even if it wasn't a Jaguar.  Power is okay, especially for a small displacement V6.  Mated w/the five speed it's more than adequate.  Overall I think it's a well thought out car w/a lot of nice touches (adjustable armrest, rear fog lights. etc.).  I would strongly recommend the car.

jaguar,x-type,2005,ARP, 01/24/2005,Jaguar X-Type 2.5,4,What a great car.  Sexy looks and luxury ride with a sporty flair.  I have driven in the heavy snow and ice without snow tires and no problems.  Getting 25 mpg.  Love the interior and quiet ride.  Takes the bumps as a quiet one-piece unit.  This is a great car for those who want something different.  You don't see everyone with a Jag.  
jaguar,x-type,2005,Glen, 05/07/2005,A Jag review,4,"I like the car over all it has a lot of power. It is small enough I like all the features in it. Coming from Volvo background, it has same comfort and gadgets as Volvo does. Very satisfied."
jaguar,x-type,2005,robert allen, 06/13/2006,Love my 05 X-type AWD,4,"The only thing I don't like about my car is the mileage, but I knew that going in.  The car drives like a sports car - quick off the line, responds easily and effortlessly, takes the corners like a champ!  There is one annoyance - a sporadic rattle and bump from the steering column (I think) which the dealer can't figure out.  Other than that, this car is a gem!  And people ooh and ahh when then see it or I tell them I have a Jaguar. "
jaguar,x-type,2005,Todd, 01/09/2007,Nice VDP,4,"Purchased an elite VDP 3.0 with decked out rims, etc.  Happy with car overall.  Hit deer going 40 mph and car held up to impact surprisingly well - only cosmetic damage.  Very sturdy car (had Volvo previously) - feel safe.  Some transmission issues already.  Fails to up/downshift causing annoying jerking to ride.  Trans seems to slip.  Premium stereo could be better.  Would like more interior space - need to adjust seats for different size guests depending where they sit.  Larger sun visors would be nice.  Don't like the center armrest much.  "
jaguar,x-type,2005,Mike, 11/12/2018,LOVE IT!,5,"This car has been AMAZING!  SO much more reliable than I thought and continues to impress me with how much I've continued to love it.  I bought it in 2006 with 9K miles on it and have driven it for 100K.  I never intended to keep this car for as long as I have.  I have owned BMW, Acuras, and this (by far) surpasses my satisfaction with those other brands.
"
jaguar,x-type,2005,J Smythe, 12/26/2005,Best Kept Secret,5,"This vehicle has been outstanding since I purchased it. 2.5L w/manual transmission is the way to go--good performance and good gas mileage. Clutch is not quite Porsche, but only one step below. The X Type does every thing well and, with the AWD, there is no need for my 4WD Pick Up here in the Wash. DC area. Looks great--most people think I paid way more for it than I did."
jaguar,x-type,2005,ntstambo2, 03/08/2005,"Looks like Ford, smells like a Ford...",2,"This car is joke.  I have this car for a rental and I might as well bring it back for a Ford Contour because that's what this is.  It's cheap inside, the engine is weak, and it hogs down gas.  The interior is cheap and the controls are a jumbled mess.  How can they calls this a Jaguar?  Anyone that buys this car and thinks they have a Jaguar is just kidding themselves.  I'm embarrased to drive this and have people look at me and think it's actually my car.  The only thing this car has going for it are the cool looking headlights."
jaguar,x-type,2005,Carol Derry, 10/30/2004,Like it but to soon,3,"Ilike the car very much but because of 
past models I am very cautious in 
making a Final judgment."

jaguar,x-type,2005,Chindit2, 02/12/2005,Excellent All Around,4,"I recently drove my X Type home in a snow storm. The only cars on the road that were not having trouble were the SUVs and me. The X-Type is under rated!! Ford has done an excellent job of working out the problems without taking the British styling out. It is an excellent value, excellent performance, extremely comfortable, head turning styling. My only complaint is that the in-city fuel economy is awful, 17/18 mpg on premium. The car does however love to run down the turnpike at 80 mph with 25 mpg. If you are wondering if you should get one for yourself, stop wondering and go for it."
jaguar,x-type,2005,Marc, 02/28/2005,That's My Jag,5,"Great in snow and rain...fun to drive, great pickup.  Very reliable."
jaguar,x-type,2005,stu, 05/01/2005,one of the best,4,Poor handling??? This thing handles like it's on railroad tracks. It tracks straight as an arrow. Slightly hard ride because of the silly 17 inch tires. Best interior materials I've seen for that price. All in all a winner for a smaller luxury sports sedan. Could use better ergonomics on the dash panel. 
jaguar,x-type,2005,medicinegirl, 05/13/2005,2005 X-type Sport...Love it!!!,4,"This is my second X type. My first was a 2003 2.5 liter, that was very reliable, and fun to drive. This one is a Sport 3.0, and is WAY better! The handling is really, really improved over the plain X types, as good a BMW 3-series, I think...well worth the difference in price. I shopped around first, looking at the Audi A4, the BMW 3's, the Infiniti G35 and M35, and even considered the S-type, but after I drove an platinum-colored X-type Sport, I ordered a black one on the spot! "
jaguar,x-type,2005,Adam, 06/29/2005,Why the Bad Rap?,4,"I read all the reviews before buying my X-type and I was a little worried as most seemed to give the car a bad rap.  After owning it for 8 months I have found only minor things I would change on the car.  Most reviews said the car wasn't as sporty as the other small cars in it's class.  While that may be true not everyone is looking for a sports car.  With the 230hp engine the Jag will get you anywhere you need to go plenty fast.  If you're looking to blow the doors off other cars go buy a Mustang Cobra for the same price.  For the rest of us who are just looking to ride around in style this car is perfect.  Drives nice, looks sharp, and I haven't had any issues yet.  "
jaguar,x-type,2005,wm, 03/13/2006,Great little Jag,4,"Traded 2000 S-Type, hated to let it go,  perfect for 130000 miles+.  But needed wagon type AWD vehicle,  not SUV.  Still get admiring glances,  although not as many as we did with S- Type.  Comfortible,  beautiful,  classy,  great in snow.   Plenty of power, and most luxury features found in higher priced cars.  Carpeting and sunvisors are cheap jack,  but overall cars lives up to its image.  Wife loves to drive it,  and feels very secure doing so in adverse weather.    "
jaguar,x-type,2005,proflovell, 04/20/2006,Ocean to desert round robin,5,"The only reason I did not give the interior design a 10 rating is because, at 6'1"", I have tended toward larger cars. That said, a recent 1200 mile journey to Death Valley & return was our maiden trip to put the ""darling little car"" (my wife's description) through a gentle test run. We tent-camped in Furnace Creek, hauling all we needed in the cargo area; freeway driving was a fun run for a change with the sport-feel of the road; country curves & desert ""thank-you-mums"" were even more pleasurable with the X-Type's road- hugging & shorter wheelbase handling. Our 25 mpg average on this trip was most welcome in light of the $3+ pump prices; a fair exchange for a downsized wagon."
jaguar,x-type,2005,John, 06/01/2006,I love this car,5,"This is my first Jag and I love it. It handles wonderfully, has lots of power, and has presented no mechanical problems whatsoever. The sound system is superb. It's great in the snow and cuts through large drifts without problems. Overall I would definitely lease this car again."
jaguar,x-type,2005,CMcnam8163, 07/25/2006,Great Car,4,"I love my car.  I never have seen another one on the road.  This car is so practical, I really hope they continue making them. I'm really tired of SUVs and this car is the perfect alternative.  Really stylish!"
jaguar,x-type,2005,otis, 10/21/2004,* * X-cellent Jag to drive * *,5,"i absolutely love my x-type. it has
quick response from handling to

windows go completely down. get the
premium alpine sound system w/cd
changer...it's awesome!"
jaguar,x-type,2005,Filmwritin, 11/13/2004,Underrated Cat,5,"I read lots of pros and cons on the 
Jags before the purchase, but proceeded 
after a test drive.  No regrets.  The 
car is quick and nimble.  It handles 
like a dream and has all the creature 
comforts necessary to survive the 
speeds of L.A. commuting, along with 
the parking-lot nature of the rush 
hour.  Kudos to Ford/Jag for refining 
this model."
jaguar,x-type,2005,Uncledudly, 11/25/2004,Jaguar X-Type,4,"Great handling automobile.  Other than 
wind noise, it is a pleasure to 
drive.  Given the length of the wheel 
base and suspension, this automobile 
rides rather comfortably.  I would 
defintley buy again."
jaguar,x-type,2005,Chstine, 02/05/2005,2005 Jag wagon,4,"I am one of the first lucky people to own this awesome car. It's fun, fast and luxurious. Also, it's great in the snow with all wheel drive.The only negative is not enough leg room in the backseat. Other than that after owning 2 BMW wagons this is a very nice change."

jaguar,x-type,2006,aluni@DC, 03/23/2010,Underappreciated gem of a car!,4,Came down to this and a 2007 Mercedes C Class 280 4 matric. I picked the X- Type for a more stylish exterior styling and more interior space. The Mercedes had slightly better drivability and slightly better interior build quality. But the overall styling of the X-type and the super low miles (10K on the X Type v. 39K on the C280) won me over. Both cars handled well and the engines seemed very comparable.  I really like how smoothly the Jaguar drives and how comfortable the seats are. The interior space is excellent on this.  I have absolutely no regrets about my decision. The overall quality on this car seems solid.
jaguar,x-type,2006,ivonnics, 11/10/2006,Excellent drive!,5,"Excellent drive, always dreamed about the car, and now that I own it, I am not disappointed at all, on the contrary, all expectations were fulfilled!"
jaguar,x-type,2006,Donald Jaeger, 10/28/2006,A Great Feeling About Owning a Jag!,4,"This is my 1st Jag and I must admit that this is a great driving auto and fun car to drive.  I drove many other competetive autos prior to selecting the Jaguar, but this one really drove and handled the best.  I've owned many new cars, such as C230 Mercedes, Acura RL, numerous Honda Accords and a few Cadillacs, but  this is, by far, the best car yet.  I love to drive it and I also love the head turns I get from this vehicle.  Keep up the good work Jaguar and you will have a customer for a long time."
jaguar,x-type,2006,sdettra, 07/12/2013,Hesitant at first,4,"I had always wanted a Jag but had heard bad things about them. So after 2 months of looking at reviews, researching the model and even pricing out parts for the repairs that were sure to follow I took the leap. Bottom line is I am very glad I did. Great car and with over 90,000 miles I have replaced a front wheel bearing for $28.00. Great ride Great styling and slightly above average performance."
jaguar,x-type,2006,Weslowery, 05/17/2010,Amazing Car!,4,We just bought this car and its amazing. The seats are stiff but they are so comfortable. It doesn't really get good gas mileage but its our luxury cruiser. We have been getting about 20.5 in the city. It rides great and drives even better.
jaguar,x-type,2006,elsaidst, 05/23/2006,"Move over BMW, Audi",4,"Jag got it right, no matter what reviews say. This car is a gem. More spacious than its competition, as powerful and certainly more luxurious. Add to that reliabilty. Driving it is a pleasure, certaily a cruiser for long hauls. On winding roads it tends to float but is forgiving when pushed hard. A head turner it is at ease in traffic."
jaguar,x-type,2006,OldCEM, 07/08/2007,An Exceptional Car,4,"This car is Jag's best keep secret. It's the best trip vehicle I've ever owned.  It's quick, corners well, and is extremely comfortable on trips. Build quality, fit and finish are second to none at its price point. Its standard AWD handles rain, snow, and ice with no drama at all.  The car is heavy, and, seems to be built like a tank.   The interior has standard leather seats, and the rest seems to be made of very high grade materials. I like the retro style of the exterior, and it's a real head turner,  This is my second X Type - I upgraded from a 2.5 liter model because I wanted the extra power.  Both have been extremely reliable vehicles."
jaguar,x-type,2006,karl, 09/29/2009,Instant classic,4,"Well this is my first jag, if you are a car person then this is a really cool car. There are better cars out there for sure, not that much better. I purchased the sportwagon version. I wanted utility and sportiness, and it is a rare car for sure. I looked at BMW, Mercedes, Audi, and Jag. of course. I like the fact that jag's not going to be outdated by newer models and it has the classic styling of older jags(hood ornament). I believe it will be a sleeper classic in wagon form only though. It could get better gas mileage but IT is a Jag not a Honda. I think in ten years gas cars as the way we know them won't exist and this will be still a Jaguar not a prius. My 2 cents."
jaguar,x-type,2006,lcatchpo, 05/25/2008,$350 hood emblem!,4,Not once but twice I've had the hood emblem stolen. I'll never own another Jaguar because of this. They could at least have mounted it differently instead of putting a spring inside. It's such a shame because this car is really a dream car. Luxurious and sporty and affordable but you'll need the savings to replace your emblem every few months. 
jaguar,x-type,2006,Kevin Kiper, 11/20/2008,Love the Leaper!,4,"Unbelievable car.  Found it new at the dealer.  It's been even better than I expected.  Makes even driving around the block fun.  And, the car is a total head turner.  Very distinctive when compared to all the BMWs, Mercedes and Lexi on the road.  I get tons of compliments on the car."
jaguar,x-type,2006,Antonio, 06/17/2006,Jaguar X-TYPE Sport Package,4,The car handles well even in tight corners and with all features included in the price of the car compared to its competitors it becomes the best value for money in its class. Very eye catching especially in black. The overall ride is comfortable albeit in the sport package you feel the road more often. Engine is well positioned to provide quick acceleration when needed. The car's interior wood grain enhancements lend a level of elegance while its external mesh grill in the sport package provide fun and flair compared to others on the road.  All-round best value for money with great handling and style. 
jaguar,x-type,2006,Tom Moore, 12/18/2005,A good decision,4,"I've owned Mercedes & Lexus. The Jaguar is the best yet and they are not as common as the others. The AWD Jag performs on ice and snow just as good as the AWD Lexus. To date, I'm very pleased and believe I made the right choice."
jaguar,x-type,2006,J.MAY, 09/02/2006,2006 X-Type personal car,4,The ride and quiet of the car is excellent. It is the perfect size for me and my family.
jaguar,x-type,2006,rykom, 01/23/2007,2006 Jaguar X-Type,4,"I recently had the opportunity to take a 2,000 mile journey in this vehicle and was amazed at how well it performs and the way power is delivered from its sweet purring 3.0 liter V-6. This is my first ""Jag"" and even though the fuel economy is not great, the way it rides and people's reaction to the name and car design more than makes up for it's deficiency. The all wheel drive and brake feel are reassuring in inclement weather and the ivory interior is pleasing to the eye, elegant as in british sophistication. If you are looking for head turning reactions and pride of ownership in this price range go for the Jaguar X-Type."
jaguar,x-type,2006,Frank, 10/24/2007,Most well kept secret,4,"A beautiful, understated, elegant and powerful vehicle.  AWD is a huge plus for me and I am surprised how well this car is built and drives like butter.  The feel of it while driving is incredible.  I have ridden in and driven BMW, Mercedes and other luxury cars, Jaguar X-type is the most humble (in a good way) and solid luxury car.  I would buy another X-type in a heart beat.  Test drive one and you won't be disappointed.  The body construction is both light and feels strong.  I love it."
jaguar,x-type,2006,George , 05/11/2008,No Other Car Like It,4,"This car has no equal. Drive one for a while and you'll see what I mean. Power is adequate, handling on wet roads is simply unbelievable. I've had 3 BMWs and the X-Type easily, very easily, and I'll say effortlessly, could run off and leave them on a winding road--wet or dry. On the straight interstate above 115 mph handling is about the same as the BMWs I've had, maybe a little better but nothing outstanding. Interior is nice with the VDP package. Interior doors handles are hard to pull to open the door and that is common to all X-Types. Bad design using a cable. Have to remove a lot of stuff to change plugs on the rear cylinder bank. BMW is a lot easier."
jaguar,x-type,2006,brucelee, 09/07/2010,Head Turner,4,"I love this car. I'm 6'4"" 330 lbs guy who is comfortable when driving this car. I have recently went to look at the Jaguar XJ8 and now I will buy it soon. May I warn any potential buyers, people will talk about the jag but would love to be in your seat driving the jag. It is fast and dependable. The gas is great. It cost 27 dollars to fill up tank with 93 octane. That is great. This car is an attention getter. It cost to be the boss. I went to local dealership for oil change and was amazed that you only need an oil change every 1 year or first 10,000 miles. So you save money. At this moment no problems with vehicle. I wish I had a navigation system and this would make this a total package "
jaguar,x-type,2006,Bad News, 10/21/2010,Poor Quality Parts and Finishes,1,"Major disappointment! At under 30,000 miles and after having kept it in perfect condition, the interior began to literally fall apart! And what did Jaguar senior maintenance manager have to say? She hung up on me when I demanded to know who her boss was since she didn't want to take my complaints seriously. All told - $1800 to get it fixed! Never buy another Jaguar again! Can't wait to unload this one!"
jaguar,x-type,2006,Frank Swit, 06/02/2005,Jaguar X-type,5,"We are very pleased with our X-type. We bought it for the styling, the all wheel drive and the over all ""size"" of the vehicle. We have not been disappointed."
jaguar,x-type,2006,Oldengineer, 05/23/2006,A cat with bigger claws,4,"Just replaced my 03 X Type 2.5 with an 06 3 Liter X.  The new cat has far better acceleration and handling. As part of the sunroof package, you get 17 inch wheels and wider tires.  I also noticed that Jag has made a number of subtle improvements since 03 - brakes are better with no dust problem; the center consol is higher quality; a second cupholder has been added; the seats have been improved. Another plus is the availability of Jags extended warranty for a reasonable price. I opted for the 7 year -100K because this car's a keeper."
jaguar,x-type,2006,William Rom√°n, 11/30/2005,Awesome Vehicle!,4,"This is my first ""luxury"" car, and can tell you I am very impressed.

jaguar,x-type,2006,Paul Worthington, 03/17/2006,What A Car,4,"When I pulled out of showroom and got this car on the expressway, I never realized a driving experience quite like this. Wow. Now I know why I always wanted to own one. This is no Caddy or Lincoln. "
jaguar,x-type,2006,Gary Brint, 07/30/2006,The Class with the Flash...,5,"Fun to drive.  Will come out of the hole like a boy dog.  Stand flat footed and jump a 5 strand barb wire fence. All of that and then some. Will be trading my wife's new Caddy in on one of these new breeds of X-Cat so that she will have one as well.  We both loved our first two XJ-6s but these X-3s are the ultimate driving machines. There is only one way to look at it - when in doubt, take the Jag."
jaguar,x-type,2006,drew, 10/07/2006,X-Type,5,Second X-Type in 2 years. Very happy with the interior rich look. Outside is styled well. A great car for the 35k price range.
jaguar,x-type,2006,g. osman, 04/05/2006,Not for everyone,4,"Handles well and is very stylish. Received a lot of compliments from consumers on tha appearance of the car overall.  Do not like the 17"" low profile  tires. Prone to flats if running over obstacles in road. Jag's overall ride is hard and you feel and hear every crack and bump in the road. This may be due to the low profile tires but maybe it's the car suspension. Gas mileage leaves a lot to be desired. Open road I haven't gotten over 25 mph."
jaguar,x-type,2006,hans song, 07/29/2006,Nice ride,3,"The vehicle is a great looking and bears a great name, yet does not drive in that manner.  I love the stylish interior and exterior.  The reliablity is somewhat of an issue."
jaguar,x-type,2006,Sandra M. Lamb, 06/18/2009,Pleased... Indeed!,4,First Jag ever purchased and I am very satisfied and pleased with its performance. Takes off at the drop of a dime and leaves everything behind it in its dust! Handles a curve in wet or dry conditions superbly. Comfortably seats my family of four including my 6 foot husband. Interior is butter soft and so classy and elegant holds true to JAG reputation. Interior works well with Liquid Silver exterior and mesh grill...heads turn when we drive by for a second look. Love the Sports car feel in a Luxury Sedan! I'm truly PLEASED INDEED with this vehicle and strongly considering buying the XJ or XJ8 for my husband.
jaguar,x-type,2006,mechanic80, 11/02/2018,The look of a Jaguar the issues of a Jaguar...,4,"Maintenance is the most important thing.  Being a certified mechanic, maintaining the unit is not an issue but it's intense.  The best thing is the looks you get... precious.  The finish is flawless after 15 years.  Interior is a little iffy for Jaguar, but it WAS entry level.  
A year later:  I am pleased by the reliability of this car.  Like I previously said, maintenance is key, although it was well cared for before I got it!   I've refreshed ALL the fluids and kept up on any little issues before they became major.  Currently at 84K miles, I'm considering struts and tie rod ends to smooth out the ride....maybe.   I really like this car!

jaguar,x-type,2006,Kate Maanning, 06/29/2005,Jaguar x-type wagon,5,This is my third Jaguar; an S-type and an XJ8 preceded the wagon. My husband was concerned about this car being too small...we were off on a road trip to AZ and New Mex. and had everything from golf clubs to a loom for weaving to a large painting plus all of our bags etc....it all fit like a perfect puzzle. Mileage was great and it drives like a little sportscar..... GREAT FUN !!! Didn't fare too well with a collision with a deer (I stopped; she didn't) but that was fixable. We LOVE this car. Thanks for building it.
jaguar,x-type,2006,Joe, 11/15/2005,Beatiful and fun Car,5,"Previosuly owned a 2002 XJR and changed to an X-type VDP since moving back North. My comments are as follows:  Beautiful and sporty design, elegant yet chipper interior, nice torque and dampered suspension, excellent feel with the AWD.  The only problem I have with this car is the cheap plastic used in the center instrument panel and the amount of road noise on rougher roads. This is perhaps attributed to the lower profile tires. Other than that, an excellent car that always turns heads! Evryday and everywhere.  I hope they keep making this model forever, improve the interior plastics, and come out with a supercharged version. Grossly under-appreciated vehicle."
jaguar,x-type,2006,jcwstep11, 07/31/2005,Love the Car,5,Thank you Jaguar. We traded in a Mercedes Benz for the new wagon. It is soooo much fun to drive and a real sport wagon. Both my wife and I enjoy driving the car. The new design really caught our eye and had to have one. We get lots of comments on the street about it and lots and lots of looks and smiles Again Thank you Jaguar 
jaguar,x-type,2006,El Jefe, 11/20/2019,A Beautiful Work of Mechanical Meyhem,2,"The good news is this the sexiest car I've had and looks great. I got it for what I thought was a low price for Jaguar but I have put more than double what I paid for it into repairs on this beautiful work of a mechanical mayhem. I had some very expensive problems with the cooling system and the rear axle. This car gets terrible mileage and is expensive to fill with such a large tank. The leather seats cracked and come to find out they are pleather, not leather. I've now had a Jaguar & don't think I'll be getting another.
"
jaguar,x-type,2006,Armando, 07/09/2005,Love my Jag,5,Handling on winding costal roads on Highway 1 was excellent. The automatic transmission shifted up/down perfectly with a good solid feel for the road. The brakes never faded or grabed. A very comfortable and relaxing ride in town on the free way or on winding twisting roads. Plenty of power from the quiet smooth 6cyl engine.
jaguar,x-type,2006,Steve L, 08/11/2005,X-type grip it and rip it,4,"This car is fun to drive, holds the pavement well. Acceleration is sufficient. Fit, finish and feel are better than expected.  "

I am having this looked into too, as it is obvious a bad paint job, otherwise the car itself is well built and gives the driver the feeling of being in control. I am a previous owner of two Lexuses and have decided to make a change, I am looking for good customer service as well as dependability in a vehicle. I find that to be most important overall. "

jaguar,x-type,2006,LJ, 02/23/2006,New 06 Jag,4,Traded in a 2002 Sport 2.5 for loaded 3.0. The build quality is quite a bit better than the 02. It has a very a beautiful Zircon metallic paint with a chrome mesh grill that turns heads wherever we go. Looks like a much more expensive car than it is. It's a powerful car coupled with a dynamic AWD.
jaguar,x-type,2006,Lisa D, 02/25/2006,My Second X-Type - Amazing Car!,4,"This vehicle is vastly underrated.  I was determined to find a ""different"" luxury car this time around, but no other could compare in style and performance. If you remember the X-Type commercial where the snow plow follows in the Jaguar's tracks, I can sincerely guarantee that this is the handling this car delivers. I am even more impressed with my new VDP Edition.  The exterior styling turns heads and the interior is simply beautiful.  A recent visit to the car wash reinforced the image of this car - even among the other top luxury cars, this car truly shines the brightest."
jaguar,x-type,2006,Sue Abbarno, 05/18/2006,Fun and classy,4,"This is my 2nd X-Type. Suspension is improved from 2002 model, and the additional front cup holder is convenient; the memory seat is handy. This car is loaded with features. I love the leather interior and wood trim. Fun to drive."
jaguar,x-type,2006,Hedy Elefritz, 07/06/2006,What could enhance my Jag Appreciation,3,"I formerly owned an S-Type but drove an X-type as a loaner. Because I needed the security of a bad-weather performer (all-wheel or front wheel drive) I ""scaled down"" on amenities.  I miss automatic seat adjustment, interior space, softer ride but really enjoy the confidence and handling of my VDL. What keeps me from shopping other cars with amenities AND AWD or front wheel is the excellent service and performance with my particular local dealer. If the S-type had better bad weather driving capability, I would return to that vehicle.  Or, if the X-type could upgrade, I'd be a happy, contented driver."
jaguar,x-type,2006,thebobs, 07/12/2005,"X type, XJ looks at a K- Mart price",5,"A great road eating machine. Why the bad reviews? The car transforms from a blvd. cruiser for my wife to a true sports sedan with a touch of the ""S""  button and the help of VVT for me. The AWD is great in both wet and dry conditions. I drove the car 226 miles in heavey rain, wind and fog. The AWD made the trip fell like it was a sunny day.The rear fog lights that are three time brighter then regular tail lights made me fell safer since I could be seen at a greater distance Very comfortable on long trips.I have had no problems since day one, everything was perfect.The large 4 weel dual piston disk brakes with ABS stop the car on a dime. Real wood in the cabin. Great leather seats.  Love the car"
jaguar,x-type,2006,Steve F, 07/13/2005,Love my X-Type 3.0,5,"This is my first Jaguar.  Was a bit concerned about reliability, but really loved the look and feel of this car.  I decided to buy it, as it has a good warranty.  Just got back on a 1800 mile road trip from Oregon to Montana.  Got 26 MPG!  Great road car.  Fun to drive.  Have almost 9000 total miles on the car, with NO problems or issues.  The all wheel drive is great. The car is quiet and handles very well. Build quality is great.  The dealership made buying a Jag the best experience I have ever had. "
jaguar,x-type,2006,Roger Henslee, 07/30/2005,FUN to drive!,4,"Before I bought this car, I had heard some negative things about Jaguar quality. After test driving the car, I fell in love with it. I opted for the 3 L upgraded engine which has something like 250hp, and is very quick in this size car. The handling is super, braking great and stylish inside. This car is very nice for the price! Negatives are the seat belt buckles which are plastic.. This car has had no problems at all ad seems a perfect mix of styling, perfomance and price. Another good thing is it is owned by Ford and made in Britian(I dont want to buy anything from the Germans since their lack of support for the USA)"
jaguar,x-type,2006,a goldenberg, 07/30/2005,"big bucks,small car",3,"good looking, but a hard ride..problems with air bag sensor, squeaky windows and squeaky emergency brake cable. took 4 trips to service, and finally fixed all issues."
jaguar,x-type,2007,Kevin Bowley, 12/04/2015,"Nine years and 111,000 miles; living with the Jaq",4,"I have owned my 2007 X-type since new, Oct 2006, and it now has 112000 miles and 9 years of relatively aggressive driving in the four seasons in Maine.  The car still gets far more ""looks"" than my wife‚Äôs '10 Audi A4 and the chassis and suspension are still very tight, noticeable difference from the day I purchased it.  It rides buttery smooth yet provides excellent feedback, on center feel, no body roll or any floaty feel even driving triple digit speeds.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the car and it has been extremely reliable.  Other than routine maintenance (2 sets of tires, brakes and rotors twice, changed out all driveline fluids once and filled with Mobile one at 75k as well as the transmission flush with Redline D4 Synthetic ATF) I had to replace a brake booster (480 at dealer), a water pump (325.00 at local shop), tie rod ends and a throttle position sensor.  I consider 1200.00 in repairs over 9 years of hard driving and setting outside darn good.  The chassis is completely rust free, paint still looks great, exhaust is still shiny steel and it the engine is very strong.  It feels much stronger than its rated 230 hp albeit rather noisy when pushed to the red line.  The 5-speed auto tranny is eager to upshift when left in normal mode in an effort to achieve good fuel economy.  Placed in sports mode it holds the gears longer, not overly, and seems to be the better overall choice for 2 lane and city driving so I always leave it in sport mode, which it retains when shut down so when you start it after setting for 5 minutes or a week it will retain the mode it was in when you last parked it, nice.  All the interior pieces show no wear, the heated Connolly leather seats are wonderfully comfortable for my 5'7"" frame and show no aging, fading, ripples nor creasing and the fronts are 8 way power.  Rear seat room is fair, fine when setting behind me but tight if the fronts are slid way back, they too are comfortable save for bit short for good thigh support but it works out because your feet rest on the floor just right.  The rear center armrest is nice and wide with two sturdy cup holders.  It has all the right safety features and then some; dual stage front airbags and a drivers knee airbag, side impact bags and overhead full length side impact bags that come out of the roof, passenger side weight sensing front airbag that also compensates for the seat position, anti-lock brakes, emergency brake assist, electronic brake force distribution, all-wheel drive, traction control and stability control (both can be disabled allowing for spinning in heavy snow with cutting power, I find it useful getting up the 30 degree hill in a foot of snow in my 2/10 mile driveway) though I don‚Äôt believe the stability control is fully disabled it does allow for aggressive off-ramp fun without interference. If left on it can be a bit overcautious as I have had it cut power during hard acceleration with a tad of oversteer on an uphill reducing radius off ramp a few times right at the apex exit.  Top speed in mine is 145 give or take, which was surprising as I was sure that the computer would intervene as others had said there‚Äôs‚Äô would cut out at 125.  It was very stable with no floating and little wind buffeting. 
The 120-watt stereo sounds decent enough and I like the auto volume adjustment as speed increases.  Reception is exceptional on both AM and FM bands with no electronic interference on the AM side, which I use frequently when commuting.  It also has the Bluetooth phone module, which works without a hitch.  For winter, driving the car has heated outside driver and passenger mirrors that work extremely well as do the heated windshield washer jets.
The trunk is surprisingly large and is well fitted but lacks any storage compartments.  I installed a couple of bins at the rear outside edges fastened with some Velcro to store such things as my bottle of
 fuel stabilizer and Marvel Mystery oil for use when buying fuel for my yard equipment.  I also installed a stretchable net a couple feet from the rear to prevent groceries from sliding forward if a hard stop is required.
To sum it up, because of the issues that plaque the early models sales plummeted and never recovered even though 2006+ models are as reliable as expected from any newer car.  It can also be found at very attractive prices in the used car market and you can get a very nice highline car for the price of a Corolla yet is far more enjoyable to own.  The car was also dinged for being a ford Mondeo yet it shares a mere 15 percent of Mondeo parts.  It is fast, comfortable, tight, elegant, attractive, and rare.  It garners attention from onlookers and it has been very reliable.  I would have no reservations jumping in tomorrow and driving it to Salt Lake to visit my brother, cruising in complete comfort and confidence at 85 mph.  With its resale now at about 7500.00, I have no intention nor reason to ""upgrade"" to a newer sports sedan as the Jag has and is a pleasure.  I wis

It is as quick as the older car and feels every bit as stable.  Very nice ride, smooth and corners like a go-kart.  Get the ""luxury"" package.  BIG difference in the interior accomodations and well worth the cost.  It's small, but it's definately a Jaguar!"

There is a lot of power and the trans is smooth. The size is perfect and I'm impressed with the safety, including side curtain airbags.

jaguar,x-type,2007,Jaffrey, 05/18/2010,"Elegant Cat, Undeserved Poor Review!",4,The typical herd mentality of reviews is on full display here. For instance:  1. Reviewer claims the X type lacks power. Yet it offers more power than both the competing BMW 328xi and Mercedes C280 4 Matic.  2. Reviewer claims interior is cheap. Yet both BMW and Mercedes ship with Leatherette seats (that is vinyl) and the C280 in particular has cheap chrome around the drink holders that flake off. The interior of the x type is real leather and plastic at least as good as the competitor  3. The x type has better 0-60 acceleration than both the BMW 328xi and C280 4 Matic.  I am glad I bought one after test driving the competition. It's beautifully to look at and drive.

jaguar,x-type,2007,BlueMountain, 05/17/2007,Stay away!,2,"At 87K miles most would expect all parts of the powertrain to be intact but not with the X type. The dealership tells me I need a transmission, axle, transfer case along with water pump. I just fixed the wiper motor and the engine is pinging. I thought I just got the trouble car but I learned the transmission went out on 2 other owners I talked to in the Jaguar waiting room. No wonder they offer only a 50K mile warranty for such an expensive car. The one thing that hurts so much is the value drops like gravity. I owe 20K on this car and it looks nice and all but is only worth 11K according to KBB. Consider yourself warned. Stay away from this car."

How misplaced those reservations were. This is a beautiful car to drive. Its power is exceptional, luxury finishing is good and the AWD is truly brilliant. 

On the day I bought it, I had to travel a distance of more than 1400km. I had a tyre burst doing 160kph trying to get my destination (I know its speeding, but the road was long and empty and therefore irresistable.) The Jaguar did not deviate an inch. I slowed down, assessed the damage, put on the spare and was away."

No other car in its class comes close.  I live in S. Florida where it rains like hurricanes.  One day, I notice power transferring to another wheel while flying down the highway in a downpour.  The X-type tracked straight and true in a blinding rain.  Moments later, I saw a car which had hyroplaned off into a canal.  What car will I buy next?  One that has luxury features, AWD, 225 hp and an unsurpassed service program; all for the low $30,000's.  There is only one such car.  The X-type.  A fantastic, fabulous car that has no comparable."

Wasn‚Äôt great on gas but my daily commute was short. The only thing that cursed it was the timing chain tensioners... I knew even before buying it that this issue was a big one IF it were to happen to me... and after two years of ownership it happened. And mine had extremely low miles. It was 15 years old when I had it and the odometer was at 56k. It was a one owner car. I wish I could have kept it, but repairs were getting too costly. Buy models 2003 and above.

Don't even consider a Germany car over this, they do not compare."
jaguar,xj-series,2001,John Mulvihill, 03/12/2015,A bargain if you do the preventive maintenance,5,"This car is a bargain in the used marketplace, with excellent performance and reliability. But there are weak areas. Make sure the plastic timing gear has been replaced with factory metal components. And, that the plastic water pump has been replaced with the factory metal unit. 

Do not buy an XJ that's been through an overheat. Look for sludge on the valve covers. 

The ZF automatic is ""sealed for life"" and prone to failure over 80K miles unless thoroughly cleaned out.

Buy one of these cars only if you know of a non-dealer Jaguar speciality shop that can service it. (Check with your local Jaguar club.)

Update: March, 2017 :  I'm not sure when I first posted my original review, but it's been at least a couple of years.

Over that interval I've put on a lot of miles, including an extended road trip to Canada. Now at 148K miles and nine years of ownership I have many compliments and only a couple of complaints.

On the complaining side I wish the car had better fuel economy. I rarely drive in Sport mode, and I'm not a stop-light drag racer, but my XJR does no better than 16 mpg in around-town driving and 20 or 21 mpg on the highway at 75 mph.

One weakness I watch out for: the ZF five-speed automatic. It uses synthetic transmission fluid and supposedly is ""sealed for life."" In other words, you'll never have to change the transmission fluid. That's all well and good it the owner thinks the car's lifespan is over at 80K miles. But this is a 250K mile car. As metal dust circulates through the transmission over the years, it accumulates and clogs the filters and magnets and lodges in nooks and crannies. My expert mechanic went through my transmission at 100K miles and flushed everything, including the torque converter, which is a tricky operation. The result is all I could have hoped for. The fluid is still clean 48K miles after.

Today's generation of luxury cars come equipped with V6s for the most part, some with inline fours, all turbocharged. To achieve my car's 400 hp (I've tweaked the Eaton supercharger), they need to boost these small engines mercilessly, and that can't be a good thing. Manufacturers are reducing engine displacement to meet government standards for emissions and fuel economy. and the new generation of luxury cars give 2 or 3 mpg more. I'll gladly keep my 32-valve DOHC V8 with supercharger. Unlike today's turbocharged cars, there's no lag on acceleration and the blower emits an intoxicating whine. This is what a Spitfire must sound like. The car makes power as new and I get a thousand miles out of a quart of Mobil 1.

Since I wrote the first review my privately owned (non-dealer) Jag specialist shop has needed only to change the oil and a couple of filters and replace spark plugs. The shop's owner and chief wrench, Juan, tells me this generation XJ-series (1998 - 2003) is setting a new standard for reliability as the cars age. There is a proviso: XJs built before 2002 need their plastic timing gear and water pump replaced with factory metal parts. This is expensive, a couple thousand dollars. But one the metal components are installed, there will never be a need to fix this problem again.

In summary, my affection for this car has grown, and I'm obliged to give it five stars over its previous four. Even though it's 16 model years old, the car is holding up superbly. It's still tight, the original Bilstein shocks are still doing their job, and I am no longer worried about unexpected breakdowns. I'm 67 now, and don't see the need for another car: this one will outlive me.

Also holding up well are the Connolly leather (with maintenance, and always parking the car indoors, as did the original owner) and the factory-optional Emerald mica paint. Apart from stone chips, the paint looks as new, with the same intense emerald green. As with the interior, the paint's longevity is dependent on the car being parked out
 of the weather.

I've driven the new XJ and am a big fan of Jaguar's new lineup. Finally the Germans have a serious competitor in the sports sedan arena. But without a doubt, my old XJR rides better than the new one. My car is better insulated from the road, and you hardly feel the imperfections you drive over them. By comparison, the new XJ with its 20"" wheels (as opposed to my car's 18"") and rubber-band tires just can't absorb the bumps as capably. There's no doubt it handles better on a twisty road. My XJR doesn't like tight twisties, but put it on a road with long sweepers and it's in its element.

You can buy a car like mine privately on Craigs List for around $4,000. (I paid $12,500 for mine nine years ago, when it had 85K miles on the clock.) The trick to buying one of these is to purchase it privately from an enthusiast owner who has maintained it rigorously. Don't buy one from someone who has not kept the service records. And don't buy one if you don't have access to a Jag service shop that is not part of a dealership. Do buy one if you have driven one and love it.

jaguar,xj-series,2001,mad lawyer, 10/14/2010,"Bad cat, worst pick of the litter",3,"I've owned many luxury cars, all American, hence I never had a jag before.  Bought this one used because it was just so pretty sitting on the lot.  From day one, I've had nothing but extremely expensive repair bills from the most wide variety of areas, including, windows, sun roof, shocks, transmission, wheel bearings and finally the engine. In just over 3 years I spent over $10k on repairs, including $3500 for trans., and now they want $7k for a new engine, as I was stranded out on a quiet freeway in a corn field when the engine died last month. I would never recommend this vehicle."
jaguar,xj-series,2001,New Jag Guy, 04/01/2003,finally got one!,4,"The thing looks like it's doing a 
hundred just sitting at the curb, and 
it definitely stands out in a sea of 
bubble cars. Soaks up the bumps better 
than even old Detroit sedans did, and 
yet is really a fine road car in the 
twists and turns.  The reviewers like 
to say the XJ doesn't communicate with 
you like the German sedans.  They're 
wrong. Seating position is great...you 
sit low, just like in an old sports car 
to really get that sensation of speed. 
Though regular XJ8's are cramped, the 
VDP is not.  Definitely the way to go.  
Don't get this car if you want to go 
around town anonymously!"

We took a six-week cross-country trip in it and it couldn't have been more comfortable.  We average about 27 MPG on the highway and anywhere from 12 to 16 in town.  It's also a real head-turner.  Lots of fun!  I would recommend this car in a heartbeat."

For the money, you can't can't get a better car. With under 50K on her, she's pretty much a garage queen. However, she does comes out to play and beat-up on those (vettes, mustangs, merc, etc.) who don't know about her racing spirit often enough to keep in good running condition. Diff went out at around 48k, and cracked motor mounts, fuel pumps, and valve cover gaskets have been replaced under after market warranty. DON'T BUY THIS CAR, without warranty coverage or if you don't have deep pockets, as repairs can be expensive. Other than that, it's still one of the BEST XJ's EVER BUILT!!"

problems other than a front end alignment

replaced front tires at no charge.  The Pirelli 
P6000s wear out within 20k miles but they 
handle and ride beautifully.  if you can afford

jaguar,xj-series,2001,John Mulvihill, 07/01/2007,"The Last ""Real"" Jaguar Sedan",4,"Ford owned Jaguar when this car was on the drawing boards, but left the Brits alone to create the last ""Lyons-era"" big Jaguar saloon, 100% British in components, design, and construction. The result is the finest XJ ever. It's low-slung (5"" lower than today's luxury cars) and gorgeous.  In the best Jaguar tradition, this big sedan is silky, quiet, and fast. Only a handful of supercharged VDPs are produced by Jaguar every year, and all are pre-sold. Supercharged VDPs are the ultimate Jaguars, and this generation of XJs is the finest of the breed. Tightening safety and fuel economy standards mean we'll never see cars like this again."

Occasional little nuisances crop up: auto tilt mirror failed to auto tilt, fixed by removing and reinserting all fuses in back seat kick panels (none were blown).   Outstanding handling in snow w/4 very aggressive snow tires (forget all-seasons).  Uses a little more oil than a car of this price range ever should (1 qt about 1,000 miles).

I love the sound system and the power everything is outstanding.  It is a well built vehicle and doesn't leak at all.  The design of the interior is spacious and very welcoming.  It is definitely a head turner.  The car is heavy on a steel frame so tires and brakes do not last as long as they should.  The brakes are a dual soft system and the rotors ware quickly.  They provide superb stopping power but will need to be replaced soon and and often.  "

It does have it's quirks but they are far overridden by the cars elegance and luxury. All her local driving is done in her Maxima and long journeys are taken in the Jag. This is a touring car and is designed to be driven on the highway for long distances at cruising speeds(within the law, of course). Jags have had a horrible history with quality control that I believe Ford ironed out when they took over. Neither of us has ever quite driven a vehicle quality and luxury which is why it is probably the best car we ever owned. "

Weakness: does not go in the snow, at all, not even a little bit.  Rear wheels just spin even with a light dusting.  Not great in the rain, either."

jaguar,xj-series,2002,Karen Cassidy, 11/16/2015,Rode the heck out of this car,5,"I bought this car in 2007 (5 years old, 45k miles). I paid $18k used, less than my friend paid for her new VW beetle and i'm driving a gorgeous luxury car. The only visible flaws were cracked walnut paneling and I had the overhead cloth replaced. Then I have proceeded to drive the heck out of this car. I've commuted with it 500 miles/week  for the last 7 years, hauled my scuba gear in the trunk (in a plastic bin), and many road trips with or without camping gear. One reason I bought the XJ8L is the big back seat; at that time anticipating large passengers. As I started doing Triathlons I discovered just taking off the front wheel I can fit my entire racing bike in the back seat easily, quickly, and with little impact to the vehicle. I've had two consistent problems- with coolant sensor light and fuel cap light- that after several fixes I have just decided to ignore. The only problem I ever had driving is when I took an 1500 mile RT drive to Key west; since the car was built for a tall british man (and I'm an average American girl) after 600 miles my back hurt cause I didn't fit right. It's now 13 years old and near retirement at 220k miles; since the right rear wheel bearing gave out, will likely replace vs. repair.

My Jag has over 100000 miles but was very carefully maintained and always garaged.  It is like new beautiful.  Other than brakes and new serpentine belt, my only action to make the car perfect was to replace the deteriorated rubber gaskets around the door handles.  The car drives smooth as glass and is eerily quiet inside and out side. I like the little luxury touches like the pull down trays in the back seat.  The 15 year old car does not have all the whiz bang electronics like a new Jaguar, but I like it better for that.  The back-up proximity buzzers are neat.

Rolls Royce.  What I couldn't believe 
is that these Jags are still hand

all.)  I can't tell you how many

It's been wonderful.  Classic British

It had 140K miles but only cost 5K.
WOW! FUN to drive.
Even with 140K miles is still tight, dependable, runs great & drives oh so smooth.
I am looking forward to upgrading to a 2008 or 2009 in the next year."
jaguar,xj-series,2003,James, 12/04/2010,Great Vehicle:,4,"I purchased my XJ8 used with about 34,000 miles on it, and have been extremely pleased with the XJ8 all around, performance, ride and drive, comfort and convenience, and have had no major problems with this vehicle whats so ever it still feels as solid and secure as the 1st day I drove it and was sold buy the way it drove period, and now understand what all these owners have in common and why the reviews are always so good on the 2003 XJ8.    "
jaguar,xj-series,2003,James, 06/22/2006,Jaguar Excellence,5,"This is the 7th jaguar I have owned, all have been great cars. This one the XJ8 seems to be the best to date, all round flexibility in comfort in town and highway. I do not think anyone could overdrive this car, it sticks like glue and goes where you point it. it never fails to get comments on its looks, It truly is in a class of its own. "
jaguar,xj-series,2003,trexville, 04/08/2004,Great at a good price,4,"I paid $41k for a 2003 XJR in 3/2004 
and figured it was a great price to 
sample a car I have always liked from 
afar.  At $41k I'm super, super 
pleased but don't know if I would have 
been so pleased if I had to pay close 
to the sticker price.

The car looks great and drives great.  
But you get more bells and whistles 
with the Japanese and German luxury 
cars, so if that's important, I might 
look elsewhere.

However, there's no beating the Jaguar 
styling inside and out.  This car has 
big-time personality -- all that wood 
and leather and its feline exterior 
make for a scrumptious package."

dealer in LA in the year 2003.  I love 
this car.  Yes, a bit expensive-yet 
extroardinarily satisfying.  No other

exterior styleing.  Mine lacks the 
370/now390 hp supercharged engine, 
however the stock 290/300hp 4.0L V8 is, 
to me, quick enough.  My son drives my 
car on a pretty frequent basis and I 
worry about him out on the road w/ 
390supercharged hp to his disposal

buy one of the new ones!"
jaguar,xj-series,2003,Joseph J. Young, 06/02/2018,"Elegant, stylish and sexy.",5,"Only those who really know cars will buy a Jaguar XJ8. These are well thought out designs and every component seems to be carefully made...but not the cup holders. The next time you look at cars have a careful look at a Jaguar instead. You'll notice certain details like the four square jack stands that are in just in the right place and the hood ornament that tells you exactly where the front end is and the silky feel of the steering and controls and the exuberance of the V8 and the solidness of its chassis and structure and the excellent lighting. The big cat's proportions are correct in the 2003 version. Put it up on a lift and you'll notice right away that it's built like a brick. This Jaguar is the best car I've ever owned.

jaguar,xj-series,2003,Rick, 04/15/2006,Best car I've ever owned,5,"Amazing vehicle. I have owned A Mercedes S600, a Lexus LS400, a BMW 750il,and a Bently Arnage. None of these cars even comes close to the Jag. I love the engine, it is smoother and more powerful than the V-12s of Mercedes and BMW. I rip apart every mustang and corvette that stops by me at a light. The transmission is amazing. It always shifts very smooth and right on time. I love the beautiful interior, it is much more luxurious than those of its competitors and even my Bently. It's also better looking than them too. You simply can't get any better than a Jaguar Super V8."

jaguar,xj-series,2003,M. Montecelli, 04/27/2005,Breathtaking Automobile,4,"It is beuatiful, fast, and sexy.  When I am cruising down the freeway (once at 260km/h), just smoothly gliding along, listening to that cat purr, I feel like a billion bucks.  It is fairly practical, maybe not such as an S- class, but still not bad.  But the pure thought of knowing that I am in such respected, hand-built piece of art that rides on four wheels, it does not even compare to a Benz.  I can drive my Jag everyday, take it on weekend vacations, and look absolutely 'pimp' compared to everyone else on the road.  FABULOUS CAR!  PS Buy one, its worth it!"
jaguar,xj-series,2003,Craig Seifert, 06/24/2007,The Jag,4,"Bought the car for my wife, but love to drive it when she'll let me.  Picked it up in DC and drove it 200 miles on the interstate to get home and was impressed with the comfort, stability, power and control.  Two days later, we drove it to Michigan from Virginia Beach.  Again, superb is the word.  We've owned and driven a lot of high end cars, but the XJs are in a class of their own.  The styling is refined from decades of improving on a base design from the late sixties.  The engineering has too.  The base 300 HP 4.0 L V8 coupled with the 4 speed automatic is powerful but smooth, sophisticated but dependable and pretty efficient (20 mpg), considering that it's pushing a 2.5 ton car."

The Super has a few more bells and whistles including a plusher seat package. The main difference is the supercharger. It really brings the V8 to life. The standard engine has plenty of power, this just puts it over the top. Very comfortable, the SuperV8 has a bit stiffer suspension than the standard models but it is still very smooth. The Alpine sound system is superb."

my Boxster S from 0-60 while giving 
you a plush ride.  Drove both the 2004

No problems to speak of, the dealer did replace brake pads and rotors under warranty at 11,902 miles. one of the most comfortable cars for driver and passager, back seats are cramped, but a small price to pay fo rthis car.  Have gotten use to the navigation and really like it now.  After owning a Jaguar, it's hard to consider driving anything else. Such a high build quality, high grade materials that you jsut don't see in other cars."

The supercharger helps the V8 get up to 
60mph in a little over 5sec., not bad 
for a 4000lb car. Styling has been 
around for a few years, but still a 
head-turner and unique from the 4-wheel 
box cars out there now. Only option

I knew I would be replacing the four CAT shocks at approximately $1500.00 for the set of four.  The front sway bar links, $60.00  This is the cost for the parts as I perform my own labor.  I also just replaced the front brakes, changed the supercharger oil, replaced a broken headlamp and a missing center wheel cap.  I love driving this car.  It is beautiful, classy, fast and rides like a dream.  There are no electronic issues, the interior wood trim is superb.   I'm very pleased with it and very glad I found the car for sale.  I'm not one for attention, but every now and then, someone tells me how good the car looks, and yeah, it does look good.

jaguar,xj-series,2004,Jim K, 11/30/2015,Nice Kitty,5,"I have now owned my 2004 XJ8 for 9 years. It has proved to be a very satisfying car to drive and to own. The reliability so far has been excellent. I have presently approximately 90 K miles. I do not drive it in snow as it has very poor traction and I don't want to expose it to salted roads. The comfort on long trips is exemplary except that it is slightly cramped in comparison with other sedans of this level.  Trunk space is also limited-better than the older model but still fairly small.  The gas mileage on highway driving is very, very good.  The seats are very firm which means they are comfortable on long drives. I recently drove mine from New England to South Carolina (about 850 miles) and was impressed with the long haul comfort of this cat. Resale value is unfortunately pretty dismal but if you are buying one you can buy one cheap. They always turn heads with their classic looks. Update: the Kitty is still going strong now in 2016. No major repairs-just routine maintenance-brakes, tires, oil and scheduled adjustments. Update: 12/01/2016-the Cat is still going strong. The only repair since my last post was a blower fan for heat/AC. Reason: mice got in and made nest-and fan got ruined in the process. So still going strong and no reason to change my previous glowing review. Update:12/2018. My Jaguar is still running strong. The headliner, of course, is sagging now and I am probably going to address it in the spring but other than that no issues. The car still runs and feels as new. I am appreciative of the classic look more and more as I see all the cookie cutter cars out there. Update: 12/02/19-nothing new to report -the car is still running strong and continues to be a comfortable, sporty, reliable daily driver.  I replaced the thermostat during routine oil change and radiator flush. I do not run it in snowy conditions which Helps keep it in good condition. The brake lines are still original and undercarriage looks clean. I think the air suspension will be needing attention but still not throwing warnings other than severely cold days( which is par). Update: 6/2020: Still driving and enjoying this lovely car. Oil changes and new thermostat since last update. Car showing check engine light but starts and runs normally-I will bring it in shortly to check and get oil change. I drive the car all winter other than a few days as we had no real snow after December. Still love this car-it will be a family heirloom.

jaguar,xj-series,2004,Mark Olsen, 10/25/2015,Best Luxury Car Value You'll Find,5,"Go to any website and look up the reliability and handling of the 2004+ Jaguar Xj8 and you'll find owners LOVE these cars.  For the money they are the most luxurious, best handling, greatest looking, and distinctive luxury cars on the planet.  The 2004+ models were the result of over a billion dollars spent by FORD in improvements to the Jaguar range.  These cars are never mistaken for anything but a Jaguar.  I have owned two of the 2004 models (and drive one currently) and they both provide outstanding handling, value, and the kind of driving experience that gets your heart beating when you turn the key.  As far as I'm concerned, when friends ask me if I like my Jaguar luxury/performance car, I just say there is NO OTHER CAR.  I just can't say enough about the experience of owning a Jaguar.  It is a singular pleasure unmatched in the motoring world.  Update:  Two years later not a single problem.  Car is a dream.  Buy one.  Update after two years:  Car is fantastic.  Still no issues whatsoever.  Only maintenance is changing fluids.  The 2004-2009 Jaguar XJ8 (350) are the last, repeat last, of the traditional Jaguars in terms of styling and traditional luxury interiors.  I'm convinced these cars will or are becoming modern classics.  A 3004-2006 with under 45000 miles can still be had for under $15k and probably will never depreciate any lower than that.  Care for one and drive it sparingly and you'll probably see an actual increase in what you paid in about 5 years from now.  That fact pales in comparison to the smiles on your face as you turn the key in this magnificent motoring machine...as Sir William Lyons said, ""The closest machine you can get to something that's actually alive.""  The 350's are like rare fine wine, meant to age well and be enjoyed for years to come.

UPDATE AS OF 7/2019:
In July 2019 I purchased a 2008 XJ Vanden Plas from a dealer in Palm Springs.  Car had 29k miles and I paid $17.8k for a car that originally sold for $84k at Desert European Jaguar in Rancho Mirage.  This further backs my claim that these are one of if not THE best luxury car value to be found.  As stated before, the ride, handling and luxury amenities of the XJ8 (X350) series cars is superb.  The 2008 and 2009 models feature restyled front and rear elements, and were the last years of the 1968-2009 XJ series cars.  For specific research on these cars I highly recommend ""The Essential Buyer's Guide"" by Nigel Thorley.  Good luck searching.  It took me about three years to find this car but well worth the dilligence!

jaguar,xj-series,2004,ruyg7, 07/15/2013,My 7th Jaguar,4,"I have never owned more than three of any brand in succesion, but my Jaguars have been an exception.
My current 2004 XJ 8 was purchased with 73000 miles 18 months ago, it now has 114000 miles on the odometer
It is the MOST dependable used car i have ever owned, except for my new Dodge trucks.
This Jaguar routinely gets 28-30 mpg at highway speeds, and 20 mpg in city driving.
It has been a dream to own, and has never let me down. The car is dead reliable, a pleasure to drive , and very quick.
The interior is very plush, and is resistant to wear and tear.
Dont believe the nay sayers about Jaguar reliability, I have owned BMW's and Mercedes cars that were a lot more problamatic than my Jaguars."
jaguar,xj-series,2004,mherbst, 03/14/2013,1 Week Into Jaguar Ownership,4,"12k a 40k mile car was a steal. I purchased this car knowing something would break. You have to have that mindset for all Jaguars and plan accordingly. This car was below my budget for a used car, and I put my savings from the purchase into an account for future repairs. I'm now very glad I did. 1 week in and the sunroof is broken, air suspension has visible leaks, who knows what else.
Just the parts for the sunroof are $800, rear air suspension is $1500 for one shock.
If you don't mind working on a car yourself (which I don't) this is a decent buy, also for air suspension issues arnott makes better than factory suspension. 4 shocks for the price of a jag one."

List of problem that I was able to fix myself:
1. All lock mechanism stopped working- found used parts on Ebay for 200 for all 4 doors. New price for each door is 300+.
2. Interior blower motor stop working- found control module on Ebay for 120. New part 300+
3. Trunk latch stopped working- found trunk latch on Ebay for 50. New part 400+

jaguar,xj-series,2004,Alex, 08/21/2016,My 8th Jaguar,5,"I wrote a review for Edmunds on my 7th Jaguar which was a 2004 XJ8 a few years back. My , how i lOVED  that car, always dependable, reliable , incredible gas mileage, comfortable , and so exclusive. But i always wanted a XJR, so i sold my XJ8 and bought my XJR, took me 2 years to find the Jaguar Racing Green / oatmeal interior combination with low miles . Wow, talk about power !!!!!!!! 0-60 in 5 seconds  and 13 second quarter miles times, back in 04 , that was pretty impressive  for a 4 door sedan, even now , that is pretty respectable for a 12 year old car. I want to choke people when they say that Jaguars are not dependable, they have been THE most dependable cars i have ever owned . Yes , i have owned BMW ( the Ultimate maintenance machine ) and Mercedes Benz, ( expensive to repair )  Just look at the reviews of Jaguar owners,  and see what they say about their cars.  I bought mine used with 70K miles, the only  problem was a part in the A/C unit, my mechanic fixed it with a Genuine jaguar part , that cost much less than an after market part. I take mine on long journeys, and get anywhere from 27-29 MPG at 75 MPH, and that is with a 400HP Supercharged V8. In town, typical mileage is 22MPG. Take care of your Jaguar, do the required maintenance , and your jaguar will take care of you for many years, with a wonderful driving experience. The 04 -08 Jaguars are the last of the traditional Jaguar design models , before they were changed. They are an incredible bargain for a classic, dependable automobile.

My 2004 is most reliable car ever.
Quality of ride and handling, interior leather and paint are stunning; Comfort and Class personified.
Not an all out sports car (I still have my E-Type for that) but for a sedan I've never found it wanting for speed, handling, cornering or any other ""normal"" performance requirement.
You can pick up used ones for around $10-12K an amazing bargain.

jaguar,xj-series,2004,Jeff K, 09/30/2017,I was hesitant for years,5,"I was the guy that always admired these cars for years when I'd see them on the road. Friends thought I was crazy, that it was an old man‚Äôs car. So, I would just end up leasing a new BMW 5 Series every 3 years. I got so bored of the 5 and all the other new European sedans I'd see on the road here in LA. Finally, I said 'that's it!', when the next pristine 2004-2007 XJ comes up for sale locally I'm gonna jump on it and throw my 5 Series up on Swap-A-Lease. That day came in August of last year and found myself an 04 Vanden Plas with 41k miles on it. Paid a little over $13k for it. Just like most used cars, especially ones this old, you have to expect to do a little sorting in the beginning. I spent about $1500 in the first few months and it‚Äôs been smooth sailing ever since, just routine maintenance. The car is an absolute joy to drive. Quiet, comfortable, plush, luxurious but also light on its feet and handles amazingly well. I thought I would miss all the latest technology and convenience of a new car. I don't at all. Find an awesome independent mechanic that specializes in these cars. The dealers are way overpriced and are used to working on the modern cars. For anybody that's on the fence don't be. Just get a good one and you'll never look back. Oh, my friends that used to make fun of me now love it as much as I do

This is not your dad's jag.  It feels light and responsive.   When you hit the sport button the throttle is very responsive and you feel extremely fast.  The interior is perfect.  Everything that looks like leather IS leather and everything that look like metal IS metal.  Things you expect when your original sticker is $90k.  Ridiculous depreciation that is mostly due to the sins of the past make this car a remarkable value.  Currently the car has 85,000 miles and I've had it for 3 years.

I knew what I was getting myself into but was stubbornly optimistic.  I wanted to believe Jag had improved their reliability over the years but was quickly disappointed.  The performance is beyond reproach and I admit I am now spoiled with its power and plush interior.  But by 20K, one of the shocks blew.  By 30k, the air suspension compressor died.  By 40k, another shock blew.   By 45k, the car died mid-ride (thank God I wasn't on the freeway).  The dreaded ""engine systems fault"" light illuminated.

I have owned Caddy STS, MB CLK/AMG, a host of Vettes thru C5, and currently a 911/997 Porsche Carrera S.  Aside from the 911, a very different car, the 2004 XJR is, overall, the best car I have driven.  In 3.5 years, I have had no problems aside from one visit for front brake scuffing and two recalls.  I did have the heat element disconnected from the steering wheel - it was too hot to hold!  The supercharged performance is top notch and the exterior style is fitting of its market as is its interior.  I cannot understand the problems/ratings that several other posts have made.

The ride, the quality, the looks, and the performance are unmatchable in this price range. I could not afford a new Jag, and I was hesitant, but couldn't help myself, and my decision to buy this 5-year old was one of the best decisions ever. This car has worked flawlessly in the city (San Francisco) and on long drives. I have the car regularly maintained by a Jag dealer and couldn't be happier.

Purchase price was outstanding and I had some money to spare to take care of the inevitable used car issues.  Some things on cars fail simply because of age, and this was no exception.  A couple of thousand dollars to get a good mechanic to take care of those issues returned the Jaguar to top condition and I haven't had to do anything but change oil and filters for nearly three years now and the cat keeps on purring.  Love this car.

jaguar,xj-series,2004,welchct4, 04/22/2011,WOW!,5,"I have owned my, low-mileage (23k), 2004 XJ Vanden Plas for a little over a month now.
This automobile is without question the finest automobile that I have ever owned. The quality of the interior blows away anything from Germany or Japan. The electronics (Alpine stereo, Nav, Rear DVD, etc.) are simple, logical and easy to operate. The exterior is a timeless classic and the aluminum body make the MPG's incredible (18-20 city/28-31 hwy). In fact, I've averaged 27.3 mpg (80% Hwy./20% City) for the first 1,300 miles that I've owned the car!

Ridiculous depreciation, based upon sins of the past, make this without question the best value in the used luxury car market."
jaguar,xj-series,2004,Dale, 05/05/2016,So much fun!,5,"This car is so much fun for the money. Many people will say its ok or why a Jag , but you always can see they really like it in there face. The car would seem high priced to own but it is very reasonable. Big brembo brakes , all aluminum body and chassis and 400 hp it packs a punch! It rides on air bags, it has covette like handling, and style like royality. You slide into that rich leather and find its really a drivers car. I was looking at BMW, Camaro ,and other cars and the XJR BEETS THEM ALL HANDS DOWN. You will love it.

jaguar,xj-series,2004,Rodney Wilcox, 12/27/2018,One of the best cars I ever bought.,5,"Bought my 04 jaguar xjr about four years ago, I got a super bargain for a extremely clean car, the seller just wanted it gone and dropped the price substantially. I bought it with 112k miles on it and ran perfect and has ran flawless since. From time of purchase I have only had to replace the radiator overflow bottle, installed struts to replace air shocks, EGR valve, and a squeaky idler pulley, all reasonably cheap stuff. Its a second car for me, but its been a blast to have a car with some good performance as an alternative to driving my boring truck. I have no regrets buying this car, and I plan to hang on to it for a while longer.

jaguar,xj-series,2004,Plau, 01/14/2020,"Superb, best car ever!",5,"I‚Äôve owned this 2004 XJ8 Jaguar since I bought it brand new.  I have never regretted it.   It‚Äôs very unusual seafrost (light green) color is nowhere else to be seen & has been an eye opener since the very beginning.  It has started on the dime every single time for 16 years & has had very few problems.  The only major issue has been the air suspension going out twice.  The air suspension made you feel like you are driving literally on air, floating along on city streets or highways.   I eventually converted it to a regular suspension system & it still feels smooth on driving.  I get compliments from strangers who admire the car.  It‚Äôs a car you feel proud to drive up in.  The only thing I may have done differently was to wait a year or two when the XJ8L (longbody) version came out because it gave you extra legroom in the back seats.  It has a very distinctive, luxurious feel & look to it.  The engine when running is so quiet & smooth that I sometimes don‚Äôt know that the engine is on & I mistakenly crank the ignition again!  The people who have had negative reviews have probably had a ‚Äúlemon‚Äù which all cars have.  My experience has been quite the opposite & am a bit sad that the newer Jaguars have kind of lost that classic, distinctive Jaguar look & design.  My family has owned Mercedes & BMW‚Äôs and all have had problems.  Not this Jag!  I will keep this car till I am old and gray!  Worth every penny I paid.

Six years old and still a head turner getting lots of unsolicited compliments.  No car draws like a Jag.  32 MPG on a 400 mile highway trip (70+MPH).  I use the recommended premium on trips but regular around town.  These are a bargain on the used market.  Paid $18,000 for a beautiful car with only 43,000 miles.  For that price I could have been stuck in a new econobox.  "
jaguar,xj-series,2004,Paul, 07/20/2010,No regrets,5,"I bought my 2004 Jaguar XJ8 in May, 2008.  It had 35,000 miles on it and, yet, it has taken me an additional 50,000 trouble-free, breathtakingly quick miles.  The car is a beauty, British racing green with sand interior.  The normally aspirated engine responds well and the ZF transmission translates that power to the road immediately.   The XJ handles like a much smaller car, dancing over the road rather than crushing it as its German stablemates tend to do.  This is the best, most responsive car I've ever owned. A true joy to behold and to drive."

89 XJ6, a 99 XJR and now the 04 XJR. I 
have always been pleased with Jags and 
have never had any problems in the 
past. The 04 is beyond superb from its 
power to its class and comfort. At high 
speeds it just glides, what a pick up 
in acceleration. The technology that 
comprises this car is just amazing, it 
has a leveling suspension, drives 
itself with the cruise, heated steering 
wheel etc.. I ordered mine with every 
option possible, wow, I feel spoiled. 
I've had everything from Rolls, BMW, 
Mercedez, Audi, Lotus, Cadillac etc.. 
this is by far the best. Thanks Jag for 
a fabulous car. "

The performance of the vehicle on all types of road surfaces is excellent, and it is fun to drive.  The seats are very supportive and serve to enhance the driving experience.  Fuel economy is exceptional, with over 30 miles per gallon on the highway.  The cabin is quiet and comfortable at cruising speed.  I only wish that I had purchased such a fine vehicle sooner."

I've had only a few issues with the big cat in the 8 years I've had her. Electric issues with the A/C, and the cruise control. That's all! Once fixed I've had no other issues with them. My Jag has 58,375miles and is an awesome family car. My kids love the cool factor, my wife loves the way it drives and I love the safety features that it offers. I'm not a Jag man but I do love owning it. I also own a 2001 Ferrari 360, 2009 GMC Sierra and a BMW M3. I take care of my rides so they can take care of me. "

These were the things I was looking for in a car.
I was hoping that Ford's $3 billion investment several years before this car would resolve reliability issues.
Nope.

This car had a number of advancements that didn't quite work and are expensive to fix: 1) electric parking break, 2) air suspension, 3) aluminum unibody (rust), 4) transmission leaks.

I've dropped $11K on my $18K car thus far.
It has 50K miles.

Also, the handling isn't quite on par with the German cars; it does't love curves and corners.

In short, be careful with your expectations on this one."

the Jaguar 390 horsepower quickness.  
The ride on the low profile 19 inch

especially fond of the internal DVD 
Navigation system which covers all the 
USA and Canada. The Cruise Control 
allows you to select

selected. "

jaguar,xj-series,2004,robert ehrlich, 09/25/2006,Beautiful luxury,5,I always wanted a Jaguar but had been afraid of poor reliability. I bought the new aluminum 2004 and love it. It is the best ride of any car I have owned. Looks distinctive and rides so smoothly and quietly it is hard to keep it within the speed limit.  It has had no significant problems except for some false positives on the engine coolant warning light and remote keys that went dead in a few months. Minor compared to other cars I have bought new. Would definitely buy a Jag again but will probably keep this car for years. Jag has done a great job.

I almost bought a used 535i, but saw that the XJ8 had the same specs on weight, acceleration, hp and torque. I am tall, and not giving up performance but getting those extra couple inches of legroom really mattered, and the fun is only multiplied by the amazing stock Alpine stereo. I do have to do a repair every 6 months (mostly replacing affordable suspension parts when the rubber cracks due to the car's 15 year age. "

value are clearly superior to BMW and 
Mercedes.  My new XJ8 is 
extraordinarily comfortable.  The

jaguar,xj-series,2004,fenn, 12/01/2005,"Drives Nicely, but a piece of junk!!",3,"The XJR drives nicely and is very quick.  However, it is a poorly built hunk of junk.  My car spends almost as much time at the dealership as it does in my garage.   The quality is very poor, and it is unreliable."
jaguar,xj-series,2004,Terri Monaghan, 04/06/2018,Never again!,2,"My late husband was British. Having owned a Jaguar in the past, he suggested at some point I should purchase one.  I did so and have been paying through the nose on repairs ever since. It is something every month with this car and the repairs are not cheap.  I have had continuous transmission issues, electrical issues, air shock issues etc. The list goes on....a new code every week.  About the time I think I will sell or trade the car, a new code, a new repair. My advice is unless you just have money to spend, stay away from a Jaguar! Sure wish I had.
I have been asked to update my review. Oct. 6, 2018. My Jag is currently in the hands of a 2nd mechanic. The 1st one had it for 2 wks. and never could get the car to stay running. All kinds of codes came up, but couldn't resolve any of them.  2nd mechanic reprogrammed the computer and I was notified the car is running beautifully now. I hope it continues to do so. I really do get frustrated with this car, but I do not want a car payment.  I am comfortable with using my Jag for local use, but I am not sure it is trustworthy for long road trips. I still hold to my feelinog that I would never buy another Jag.  It's April 10, 2020 and time for an update review on my 2004 Jaguar xj8.  I still haven't changed my mind about this Jag.  However,  the costs of repairs is much better than having a new car payment.  I realize owning an older car requires more repairs, but with a Jag, they are never cheap. Since my last review, I have invested another 2k into this car.  Last towed about 2 months ago to a highly rated import garage.  They had the car for 2 weeks trying to get my car's computer to respond to theirs.  Finally, all issues diagnosed and repaired. A week later the ""air suspension fault"" reading came on. I haven't begun to deal with this issue yet.  My only advice is to really be careful when purchasing an older Jag and especially an xj8 model.
Unfortunately, I still cannot give a positive review update about this car.  I literally got this out of the repair shop (AGAIN) 2 days ago along with a $1500 repair bill.  I only keep this car because I do not want another car pmt and besides blue book value has gone down so much. It behooves me how such a beautiful and elite car can have so much go wrong with it.

It has a combination of speed, comfort, agility, style, reliability, and economy that makes it the best car on the road in America.  The interior has features similar to the Bentley and Rolls Royce, also designed by Van den Plas, the man who worked on the interior of this Big Cat Jaguar.  The full power of the car is felt in the passing lane acceleration, when it pushes you back into the seat. The eye catching looks when you pull up in front of the  finest hotel in town, or the great admiration of all the people who simply root for Jaguar owners is not to be missed.  "

It gets 28-30 mpg on the highway.(Averaged 28.6 mpg on trip from New England to Florida a few years back and that average included local driving! Only weighs 3800 lbs due to Aluminum structure and ours was the 1st year of release and is short wheel based just as we like it.

The 1st thing is that it does not rust, with an aluminum body and top paint sealers with fine grain quality paint the vehicle will be preserved looking new externally with little detailing efforts.  The top quality interior leather and wood trims is double stitched with long lasting threads which again preserves its original luster from day one off the showroom floor of the dealership.   The bottom line, the car was built to last and it will become an icon representing the last few years of the the original iconic Jaguar design.  The 8 cylinder V8 4.2L engine gives you all the power you would ever need on the highway, over 400 horsepower if you have the  XJR models with their supercharger built in.  It can compete with today's Mercedes, BMW's, Cadillac, Lexus, etc. in every areas even in acceleration with its impressive 0-60 mph in a mere 5 seconds.   Any owner of this vehicle not want any of the others mentioned because the do not possess the legacy of the Jaguar class.  You become the envy on the road owning a classic Jaguar.

The buttons fall off the airvents, the driver-seat is worse than a wooden bench, and the ignition is placed in a way that we tend to accidentally brush the key with our knee and shut the car off.  Trunk space is small for a model like this.  Headroom is minimal.  Backseat is cramped for a car this size.  I am not impressed."
jaguar,xj-series,2004,Phil, 06/10/2008,Big Cars mean Big Bills,3,"Had it for one year (18,000 - 32,000 miles), solid & responsive car to drive, firm seats stand up to wear from 4th & 5th graders. Unexpected maintenance & problems as follows: 1. Complete failure of battery & remote entry system ($1,800); 2. Worn front tires, replaced all (28,000 miles, $600); 3. Complete brake job (28,000 miles, $800); 4. Car alarm goes off unprovoked at least twice weekly, still uncorrected; 5. Radio jumps to different band on its own; 6. Had minor wrinkle in front fender over wheel, didn't break the paint, est. to repair was $3,000 (aluminum unibody, I think),  I had dent guy fix it for $200, looks ok."
jaguar,xj-series,2004,alton, 07/10/2003,new car,3,"The ride is very rough,I feel every 
bump in steering wheel and seat. The 
road noise is very loud, it appears to 
come from the wheels and floor,on some 
bumps the suspension system feels like 
it is bottoming out.This is my third 
jaguar and I believe it is the worst 
one.
The front seats are very uncomfortable 
especially when getting out of the car 
due to the high edge of the seat.If I 
had purchased this car instead of 
leasing I would be trading the car."
jaguar,xj-series,2004,RICHARD STANGL, 10/17/2003,WHY I BOUGHT A 2003 RATHER THEN A 2004,4,"I'VE BOUGHT NEW JAGUARS SINCE 1985. THE 
2004 MODEL IS THE BIGGEST LET DOWN I 
HAVE SEEN SINCE THE EARLY 90'S WHEN 
THEY REMOVED THE TRADITIONAL HOOD 
STYLING , ONLY TO LOSE SALES AND REPLCE 
IT LATER. THERE MUST BE SOME YOUNG 
STYLIST FROM FORD , THAT RUINED THE 
VENERABLE JAGUAR LOOK . THEY FORDIZED 
THE 2004 XJ. THE GAS CAP IS NOW LIKE 
THE CROWN VIC, THE HOOD OPENS LIKE A 
TAURUS, AND THE ONCE SLEEK LINES ,NOW 
RESEMBLE THE TOWNCAR. BUY A RMAINING 
2003 ASAP BEFORE THEY ARE GONE. ONE 
MIDWEST LONG TIME DEALER/ OWNER REFUSED 
TO DISCOUNT OFF LIST ON THE '03. HE 
SAID "" PEOPLE COME IN AND TAKE ONE LOOK 
ATR THE '04 AND SAY I'LL TAKE AN '03. "
jaguar,xj-series,2004,charlienmr, 01/16/2004,XJ8 is hard to beat,5,"Great looks, performance, style, and 
reliability at a price that is very 
attractive compared to comparable 
cars.  Base model is very well 
equiped.  Add a few options and the 
XJ8 competes with anything on the road 
and nothing looks better."
jaguar,xj-series,2004,Marcos long, 06/06/2007,The best Jag ever,4,"I bought my XJ8 with 87,000 miles on it. I now have 97,000 miles and this car feels and drives like new. Responsive, feels tight and it is very quiet.  It is a wonderful car to drive in the open road, because of its power and great gas mileage. You will easily get 29 mpg on this powerful v8 car!  The interior is simple, yet very elegant."
jaguar,xj-series,2004,GE1024, 06/19/2008,Great Sedan and Reasonable to Operate,5,"CATS air suspension really provides for a wonderful ride. The car sails on the highway with better gas mileage than you might believe for this 300 HP V-8 (I routinely get greater than 28 MPH highway and and average of 24 MPH with some in-town). The interior is lush. The experior appeal is super. Navigation works extremely well (get the 2007 disc). Sound system is super. If you happen to find one with the rear control-DVD system in the headrests, you will have the complete package."
jaguar,xj-series,2004,Gilbert35031, 09/13/2008,Exellent Used Car Value,4,"It's tough to beat buying a luxury car that sold for $65,000 for less than $30,000 with only 27,000 miles on it. I've owned 12 cars in my driving life and this is by far the nicest.  It's quick and super comfortable.  The ride is on the softer side however for every day driving and some fun on the weekends you can't beat it.  The reliability has been great so far.  Compared to the 745 from 2004 there are some definite differences in size and ride however they cost at least $10,000 more for a comparable car. Not worth it in my mind.  All cars are worthless in the end."
jaguar,xj-series,2004,cubby, 09/14/2008,Still unsure,5,"Always liked the looks of the Jag, I have yet to find anything I don't like about it (well maybe). The car has a little too much road noise. It comes from the front area and is more noticeable at slow speeds and when slowing down to a stop. It has all weather tires and this might be the reason for this or maybe I'm being a little over the top."
jaguar,xj-series,2004,newjaguar, 10/20/2009,Victoria and Albert,5,"This car is so good we bought an identical certified used one. We call these fine cars Victoria and Albert.  My initial 2004 review remains true. ""I cannot quite believe that I am getting a Jaguar. My last 3 cars were BMWs. I do not like the design of the new BMW. The quality of the new Mercedes was inferior. The new XJ8 design, quality, performance, and value are clearly superior to BMW and Mercedes. My new XJ8 is extraordinarily comfortable. The performance is terrific. This is not your father's Jaguar. The new aluminum body is a leap ahead of the competition."""
jaguar,xj-series,2004,Murray, 01/28/2008,Best Jag Ever!,5,"I've driven/owned all luxury vehicles and none have pleased me like the XJ series Jag.  This is my fourth one, and I will continue to buy them.  No faulting these cars any longer on quality and reliability.  And, it's still exciting to drive and gets 18/29 mpg in city/highway driving.  No BMW, Benz, or Lexus look-alikes for me."
jaguar,xj-series,2004,TJA, 02/06/2010,A Most Beautiful Automobile,5,"Even though I just purchased an almost 6 year old automobile, this car is absolutely beautiful. The interior is warm, elegant, and exceptionally comfortable. I searched for over 6 months for a BMW, Mercedes, Lexus, Infinity or Jaguar and found this most excellent of motorcoaches.  I feel good about my purchase and the car runs like a dream. The impressive acceleration is something that my Infinity does not share with the XJ8. Although I love my Infinity. This really is a work of art."

you always feel you own the road! 
Before purchasing the 2004 Jaguar XJ, I 
previously owned a 2000 XJ8 and felt 
the same way about it as I do about the 
2004 Jag... Special! During my life, I 
have owned Saab's, Mercedes-Benzes, 
BMW's, and a Range Rover, but I have 
found that driving a Jaguar is like 
driving no other! What a car! "
jaguar,xj-series,2004,RA Spell, 09/02/2003,A real improvement,3,"After owning a 99 XJ8 and an 01 XKR, I 
wanted a different brand of car for my 
wife.  After test driving all models 
with a bias to NOT buy a Jaguar, I 
still bought the Jag.  THIS CAR IS A 
VAST IMPROVMENT OVER PAST MODELS and I 
believe it to be currently the best car 
on the road.  My one complaint is 
outside appearance. I liked the lower 
profile Jag.  This is taller and more 
rounded but compensated with better 
cabin room.  Performance is it's 
strength as it is incredibly more 
responsive.  Test this car and you 
won't be disappointed."
jaguar,xj-series,2004,nelson olf, 09/11/2003,How Great It Is!!,4,"This is my third XJ6/XJ8 since 1993 and 
although I loved the first two dearly, 
this is by far the best. It is far more 
comfortable and commodious then the 
others. The power is awesome, the drive 
superb, and the gas mileage 
unbelieveable for a car this size. 
Since I am one of the last Americans 
around who smokes, I truly appreciated 
the large and easy to reach ash tray. 
The basic sound system is as good as 
anyone could ever want and the heating 
and ventilating stytem is easy to use 
and starts producing cold or heat 
immediately. I truly expect this to be 
my last ever Jaguar, since I can't 
forsee how they could improve on this 
one."

have ever experienced.  I was thinking
about a Bentley and after test driving
both cars, the 2004 Jaguar Vanden Plas
won in all categories hands down accept
in looks.  The Bentley won on that.  I
am making up excuses to run errands so I
can get in the car and drive.  I traded

because they are the most beautiful

be very good.  Handles well and a lot 
of thought has gone into the interior

they have been Mercedes S series or 
equivalent.  The Jaguar XJ8 for 2004 is 
the finest automobile that I have 
driven to date.  It combines luxury 
with great handeling.  I recently 
averaged over 30 mpg on a road trip.  
It is a pleasure to note that Jaguar

totally impressed.  Unlike prior 
models this is superb with respect to 
interior leg room and head room and 
the quality is readily apparent.  The 
six speed automatic transmission is 
seamless.  At lower speeds the engine 
does its task with no apparent effort--
and very quietly.  When acceleration 
is required it is awesome--most likely 
a consequence of having much less body 
weight.  The exterior and interior 
color choices are much better than 
other luxury sedans.  In the overall 
the XJ is a great leap forward for 
Jaguar."

wax with fewer sharp corners and edges.
Shifts too quickly from 1st to 2nd gear

My only problem was a noisy accessory belt that would chirp when the engine was cold.  Jag fixed it with the one year service.  Jag has built a high quality car with personality and every trip seems too short. The power from the V-8 is more than sufficient, with excellent fuel economy for a large luxury car.  You will find it easy to drive the car very fast, with the CATS suspension changing its setting to keep you on an even keel and comfortable.  At very high speeds (I wont say how high), the car will catch a bit of a cross wind. You will feel like royalty in this car, nothing can match it for the money.  "

jaguar,xj-series,2004,DesertRat, 08/14/2004,A Joy To Drive,4,"Drove Lexus 430s and other cars and 
have not taken a look at the Jag for a 
long time. Finally got around to 
driving one and fell in love with the 
car, it's performance, and the style of 
the design.  There is a quiet power 
about the Jag that is simply wonderful 
to drive and be a part of....and the 
looks you get when driving it are 
telling. This is a class car in every 
respect."
jaguar,xj-series,2004,Richard DuBois, 08/21/2004,The best Jag for me,4,"This is my fifth Jaguar since 1994 
and let me tell you that Jaguar has 
done a very good imporvement since 
then.  The new Vanden Plas is very 
elegant and it says british carm all 
the way.  It is very powerful and very 
roomy for me.  The exterior looks alot 
like the old model but still is very 
beautiful and the interior is very clean 
and is laid out well."

jaguar,xj-series,2004,akelley, 08/31/2004,An Elegant Rocket,4,"This is my 4th Jag. This 
Jag has the power and driving fun of a 
BMW with the distinctive elegance of a 
Bentley. All cars in this price range 
are jewelry with wheels but this car is 
the best car for the money. It is less 
than an S500 but better. Mercedes are 
so common and look like Hondas, BMW's 
look odd, and Audi, well they look like 
a VW or Toyota. When you spend this 
much money for a car you want something 
special, unique and that stands out. 
This car has it all..elegance, room, 
power and all the features you would 
expect of a world-class, head-turning 
luxury sedan."
jaguar,xj-series,2004,lindal, 10/08/2004,Great car,5,"Excellent car and fun to drive.  It 
has style much more so than the 
Lexus.  Very distinctive.  Good gas 
mileage considering it'a a V8.  Love 
the power and ride is smooth.  All my 
friends were impressed. "
jaguar,xj-series,2004,Doug Finch, 07/18/2005,XJ8 Luxury Class Leader,5,The totally new XJ8 is a truly enjoyable luxury car! It has everything a luxury car needs to have. Jaguar didn't leave anything out when they redesigned the XJ8. The option list is small since just about everything you need is standard. The available options truly can turn your car into one that you will meet the needs of all the occupants.The car feels so lightweight due to its aluminum body. It is very stiff and firm. The ride is very smooth and controlled with its computer controlled self leveling suspension. It will be interesting to see how Jaguar will improve such a fine automobile.
jaguar,xj-series,2004,Jerry, 12/05/2005,Only a Jag can be this good,4,"The fit and finish are unlike any other manufacture, if you want luxury with performance the XJR is the way to go.  Fun to drive and comfortable."
jaguar,xj-series,2004,R Horkey, 09/10/2006,2004 Jaguar Vanden Plas,4,"For the money the best car I have ever owned. Perfect ride for my wife, a little soft, but the kick in the engine is for me."
jaguar,xj-series,2004,Larry, 02/16/2007,Love it.,5,"This is my second Jaguar, having owned a 2000 Vanden Plas, before this one.  If they hadn't changed the body style I would still be driving that one.  But I'm glad they did, the acceleration on this one is great and the gas mileage is over 28 on the highway.  Love the new nav system, much better than the old one."
jaguar,xj-series,2004,Rich, 03/07/2007,Love It,4,I have not had my jag in the shop other than normal services. It has been very dependable and a pleasure to drive. The ride is great with lots of power and it handles like a sports car.
jaguar,xj-series,2004,XJ8, 09/08/2007,Very Satisfied,5,"I went from a Carrera Cabrio to this large flagship sedan. I have had no issues and have been very impressed with handling and gas mileage. My '04 XJ8 is high mileage at 64k miles. It is like new, makes an entrance, not just another ordinary Lexus pulling into the office or valet. You do feel like royalty when driving. Style, quality, reliablity, handling, and gas mileage makes a strong package. Would buy again."
jaguar,xj-series,2004,Car Buff, 11/05/2007,More than pleased,5,"Purchased just a few months ago still with new warranty and then CPO with 19,000 miles on it - I am in love. Truly had wanted one for many years but finally took the leap and couldn't be happier.  It is the most luxurious sporty car imaginable (and I am very, very familiar with most all of them out there).  Quite surprising how much of a savings when purchased 3 years old. It is almost a piece of art in a class by itself.  Now I am glad I always wanted one!"

be true. It's so nimble and precise. 
More responsive while offering a even 
better ride than before. I like the 
sporty driving experience on this car. 
This one is a totally different car

The car is flawless and is probably one of the best kept secrets in terms of $ for value out there.  The gas mileage is a shocker-avg. at min. 22 in the city and 29+ on the highway-glad I didn't buy some small, cheap car ""to get good mileage"" because this luxury/sport car gets better than them.  Not only is it impressive to look at, but to drive, arive in, and own.  Could not be more happy!!"

Very comfortable and luxurious, fast, great handling, and surprising gas mileage along with stand alone looks, make this car the leader in flagship sedans in my opinon. select Edition used is best program in the industry and Jaguar tied Lexus in recent reliability polls.

jaguar,xj-series,2005,Jaguar lover, 12/06/2006,2005 XJ8L Review,4,"This is my third Jaguar and by far the best. The quality of this car is outstanding. Owning a Jag always meant you had to have a back up auto to drive when your Jag was in the shop. But, not anymore. Class, comfort, reliability and prestige you can't get from a German or Japanese mark. Four good sized adults can fit easily in this car and everyone is happy. The aluminum body, V8 and six speed transmission are light years ahead of the previous design. I love this car. If you're looking for the whole luxury package in a full sized car, check it out. "
jaguar,xj-series,2005,nate93460, 09/04/2014,Best used car value ever,4,"We purchased this car 2 years ago with just over 90k on the odometer, and couldn't be happier with it. now with over 100k on it it still looks and drives like it just rolled out of the showroom. The leather seats hardly show any wear at all, there aren't any odd squeaks or rattles, everything works exactly as it should. The only thing that may need attention in the future is the headliner, as it is pulling away from it's backing in a couple small patches around the sun visors. not really noticeable unless you look for it. Fast, smooth, nimble, outrageously comfortable, and thus far, exceedingly reliable as well. "
jaguar,xj-series,2005,Bill, 02/17/2016,Love It,5,"I have enjoyed it for a year so far. It has been very reliable. It has surprised me on performance and fuel mileage.  City about 17 and I made a trip from Atlanta to Birmingham last summer with the A/C on and got 29.3 mpg! On the trip computer B I keep up with the oil change, but it also shows MPG.  On the first 5000 mile run it averaged 21.5.  Not bad for a big car.  It is not a slouch either.  My previous car was a Chrysler 300C with the 5.7L HEMI.  Look up the specs and compare, they are the same.  You can feel it too.  0-60 in 6.3.  Being an all aluminum car helps too.  It only weighs 3750 lbs.  300 lbs lighter than the 300C.   I'm on the look out for another one, but an '08 or '09 this time.  The next generation up from my '05 XJ8-L has a few additional things that I would like.  Like HID headlights, Bluetooth and factory satellite radio.  I'll look for a Super 8, an R or Vanden Plas this time.  The Supercharged version would be very nice.  I hope the next one is as good as this one.

jaguar,xj-series,2005,Jeremy Bell, 02/19/2018,Great old Barge,4,"I bought this vehicle at 123k mi / 15 years old. Its come along way down the Depreciation Curve - from $85k to $6.5k  It rides extremely well - its a large comfortable car. The trick (for me) is finding a good long-term previous owner ! Many of these are on a one-way trip to a 'Buy Here/Pay Here' lot... There's an Arab saying : When buying a Camel, look closer at the Seller than the Beast.
I've changed the brakes (pads and rotors ) as well as most of the suspension components. Although the body is all aluminum, it's still a large heavy car. OEM Parts are very inexpensive from aftermarket vendors, not from Jaguars Main Dealers.
"
jaguar,xj-series,2005,mike g, 07/02/2010,vanden plas rah rah,5,The 2005 Vanden Plas XJ8 is the autobahn beater that should be considered by anyone looking to combine luxury with size and power. Jaguar's flagship matches up with the S-Class and the 700 Series very well. Less weight (aluminum) equals speed and agility you would not expect from such a large auto. The additional costs for he German cars can only leave you wondering why would you spend more to get less? Compare the three. The car will sell itself.  Tally Ho
jaguar,xj-series,2005,David T., 05/18/2006,"Luxury, Performance, Beauty, Value",5,"I've compared specs with small-block MBs, BMWs, Audis, VWs.  The XJ VDP is the roomiest, best ride, highest hp/ton of them all and the best compromise between comfort and sport in the luxury vehicles.  It's so quiet and comfortable, yet I can drive it aggressively whenever I need to or want.  Rear knee room is huge 'cause the wheelbase is longer than even a Bentley!  The riv-bonded aluminum frame is state-of-the-art, so my VDP weighs only about 200 lbs more than my 2000 Firebird.  Imagine that!  A limo that responds like a sports sedan.  My wife loves this car for the comfort and big back seat. All this for much less than the others.  This Jag is a very fine automobile."
jaguar,xj-series,2005,WARREN STEINMAN, 09/05/2016,"ABSOLUTELY ""THE BOSS""",5,"I just purchased the almost Identical (2004 XJ8) car for my fiance. Market is still soft so I stole it for $2,900. It runs and looks as good as my first one. (Hers is white.)

Purchased 6 months ago with 160k now has 190k. It is smooth, comfortable, quick, agile,  frugal (avg hwy 27mpg @75mph). I dropped in a new radio head unit with backup camera, nav, sirius, bluetooth etc. Now it has all the bells and whistles you can get from a newer version. Car looks like new, runs like new and the best part, including the new head unit,  - $3950 on the used market. It is by far the  best car I have ever owned. My Cadillac SLS was a not so close 2nd. (previous cars - 3 Mercedes, 3 Caddy's , Chrysler 300, Prius + many many more.) right now it is an excellent buyers market for one of the truly superb vehicles you could own and enjoy.

Let me tell you, when I test drove my car (05' Vanden Plas) for the first time, it was a great feeling.  The V8 is smooth yet very fast.. sounds like a cat growling when accelerating which I love!  I think, if you're going to buy an XJ, you simply MUST buy the Vanden Plas.  The wood and leather piping alone add SO much to the cars appearance.  People do not give Jaguar enough love.  This car beats out every other car in its class by far.  The steering and suspension are absolutely wonderful.  If feels like your floating on air.  The GPS Navigation System is the easiest one I've used. "

From the performance to the feel of the car on the road, to the admiring glances from everyone it is the best.And the carpark valets park it in front of the restaurant! "
jaguar,xj-series,2005,Timothy, 02/11/2009,XJ8L,5,"This is my second XJ8L and the body design is a blend of the lower height 2003 and front grill of the X-Type.  I'm a fan of the performance.  The car is very quiet and on two extended trips of 2,000+ miles I averaged 29 and 28.5 mpg respectively.  Portions of the trip exceeded 30 mpg at 65 mph.  The driver seats are amazingly comfortable with excellent lumbar support.  As a musician, the Alpine stereo system delivers a very rich and neutral sound across the EQ spectrum, with the base being very natural, not boomy.  "

I decided to try the JAG. Being a retired pilot I wanted performance over comfort so I opted for the Super V8.  WOW!!! What a car. Great performance along with an amazing ride. No mechanicals up to this point.  Highly recommend."
jaguar,xj-series,2005,John, 06/15/2009,The Un-M5,4,"Looking for a fast, comfortable, and unique car is difficult in today's car market.  When you nail the throttle and the supercharger responds with rrrrooowwwooowwh! All you need to do is lay into the accelerator, invoke its supercharged 4220-cc V-8's 390 bhp and 399 lb.-ft. of torque ¬ó and hold on! The suspension is not 'Track Day Lotus' but it's also not Brougham DeVille.  Jaguar was able to find a happy medium between the two. As far as the interior goes, you always feel like first class British Airways in the front or the rear seats.  Set the desired gap and speed on this radar-based system, Jaguar's ACC adjusts itself to maintain a safe combination of both. All in all a fantastic car!"

jaguar,xj-series,2005,Ward, 03/12/2005,Heaven on Wheels,5,"How do you describe drivers heaven? The new Jag is an engineering marvel and it's performance leaves nothing to be desired. Road feel is exceptional, and the 4.2 V8 along with the light aluminum body give it performance second to none. I have found no defects in the car at all. And the smell of that English leather and wood are impossible to duplicate.The fringe benefit of the Jag is that the car park people at the finest restaurants leave your car out in the front to show what kind of clientele they attract. They put those ordinary German and Japaneese cars in the back."

But the conditions were immaculate. I am having some minor issues with the air suspension and I know the shocks on this car are very expensive. But I rather drive a Jaguar with this type of attitude than anything on the street for this year 2005. I have the nicest car on the block. I wish I could post a picture so you guys can see but unfortunately I can't. I highly recommend people who want this car to buy it in black or in white.

The longest road trip was from Portland Oregon to Palm Springs California about 1100 miles on I-5 .  This road trip was 15 1/2 hours with stops just for gas and food.  The seats are very comfortable and the car was a dream. After driving that distance you really get to know what your driving. Most impressive besides the handling and endless accelerating power was the fuel mileage, I was averaging in the high 20's and that's at speeds between 75 and 90mph most impressive for such a large car. The car never lost power even going up the LA Grapevine.      The return trip was just as much fun and in record time! "

The Jaguar is simply a superior automobile."
jaguar,xj-series,2005,David T, 03/24/2005,Reborn Driver,4,"This car has put the fun back in driving for me. What was a chore has become pure pleasure. I jump into my Jaguar at the slightest excuse. On the highway, you set the cruise control, settle into the pilot's seat, & luxuriate. What strikes me after driving high-end Volvos for 25 years (& a TR-6) is the quiet of the cab, the surge of power when needed, & the superb handling. And let's face it: there's no other car in the price range that has such beautiful styling. Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Lexus - especially from a 3/4 view - all look the same.  I take pride in owning a classically distinctive motorcar that turns heads, esp'ly mine. Admittedly I've only owned it three months, but I'm still in love."

pleanty of comments from even people I 
never met before. I remember the 
feeling I had seeing it in the 
showroom the day I picked it up and 
still get that same feeling as I 
approach it in a parking lot. I have

does get very good gas millage (19 MPG 
in town)  When to drivers seat heater 
is engaged the steering wheel also 
warms up quickly.  We have had no

critique -  the outside air temp

to read and we miss the rear cabin

10k miles on it and have not had to 
have it serviced once.The computer

perform flawlessly giving you that 
cushy ride without that swaying or 
bouncing feel.It has an extremely quite 
ride, in fact, it is much quieter than 
it's brother,the XJ8 model.I could go

got it right this time."

My AMG is wickedly fast, the A8 comfortable. But my Jag is the only car so far that does all these things well - in one handsome package. The surprise bonus is the economy; it runs more frugally than my previous A6! The aluminum frame is light and nimble, making this a fun car to drive actually. Its handling is not far off than the AMG, yet it's backseats are much more spacious. Awesome!"
jaguar,xj-series,2005,fenn, 12/23/2005,Balance of Performance and Luxury,4,"A sumptuous luxury car that goes from 0- 60 in five seconds!  Feels luxurious, but it also feels quick and lively, due to the light weight chassis and body. A nice blend of attributes.  The XJR seems like a wolf in sheep's clothing.  Feels really quick and sporty when compared to other cars in this price range. A similarly equipped A8, LS430, S Class, and BMW 750 will price out at a similar 75-80k price range to the performance version Jaguar XJR, and they seem much less lively,"
jaguar,xj-series,2005,Steven Bragg, 03/12/2005,Jaguar XJ8,5,"My 2004 XJ8 is a quality luxury automobile which handles like a dream. It gets the best fuel economy in its class, with 18 mpg in the city and 28 mpg on the highway.  It has a plush interior with leather and real wood trim, telescoping and electronic tilting steering, rain-sensing wipers, rear collision avoidance radar, electronically adjustable pedals, and many other luxury accessories and features.  The styling is elegant.  The over-all body length is shorter than previous models, but the wheel base is longer: giving it better handling than previous models.  The weight of the vehicle is about 1,000 pounds less than previous models of XJ series, resulting in better fuel economy."
jaguar,xj-series,2005,Wendy, 02/03/2005,Excellent ride surprisingly sporty,4,"Excellent ride, strong V8 and smooth transmission. More engine noise at high speed than S-class. Interior design and comfort is superb. "
jaguar,xj-series,2005,Jerry, 04/30/2005,Have to Love a Jag,4,"If you want Performance and luxurious comfort, the XJR is the XJR is the only one.  The quality of the leather and wood is not found in the German or Japanese competitionand the 0-60 time of 5 seconds along with the air suspension makes this both perform and ride better then the rest, and unlike the past, the quality is top notch, let alone the service you receive from the dealerships even when only having an oil change."
jaguar,xj-series,2005,ken, 05/26/2005,New XJ is great,4,"This is the best XJ yet. I have been a fan of Jaguars for many years. I have driven older ones from the 80's and 90's but they do not compare to the room, handling and power of the new XJ. They really have a great car especially with the new technology in the automatic suspension and the aluminum body and frame. The car is light and fast."
jaguar,xj-series,2005,dj, 07/11/2005,Better than a Lexus,5,"We purchased an XJ8 for my wife two weeks ago and do far, I have been awed by everything about it. I wanted to purchase the new Lexus GS430, primarily based upon build quality and reliability reputation. The Lexus has nothing on the XJ8 in those areas. Plus, it has similar acceleration, a MUCH better ride, excellent handling and better MPG. So far in a combination of 50% city and 50% highway (usually at 75mph or better), it's averaging 27 MPG! I actually prefer the ergonomics of the Jag to the Lexus.  In addition, our experience with the local Jaguar dealer has been on par with Lexus' vaulted reputation."
jaguar,xj-series,2005,JagLovR, 11/03/2004,Great Car,4,"Use this car as both a weekend car and
my driver takes me to work in it during
the week.  Great features, lovely
woodwork.  SUPER FAST SuperV8!  SATNav
EASY TO USE!  Comftorable Ride!  After
owning XKR's I know Jags to be well
built machines.  I have no doubt my
SuperV8 will be!"
jaguar,xj-series,2005,Richard Anapolsky, 05/07/2005,My Jaguar XJ8,4,"I love the vehicle, it's look, ride and performance.  The only major problem I have had is the computer system/modules.  I find  warning lights going on and  then the dealer having problems tracing the route of the problem.  Changing  any of the 8 computer modules doesn't correct the problem.  Hopefully the problem will be found and I will be able to enjoy my XJ8 even more.  I have also not been able to find a supplier of the trailer hitch that Jaguar  says is available for use with this auto.  In addition  producing an auto that is wired for  cellular use and  being told by the dealer that to activate it is $1,00- is ridiculous.  Jaguar should price the activation to be affordable."
jaguar,xj-series,2005,Ronell C. Brown, Sr,My Car,2,"I am a Jag lover.  The car I have now is my third Jag.  I like this one less than any other I've had.  I can not wait until my lease runs out.  When it does, I will buy or lease a new one. (another Jag)   When I start this car, it sounds like the 1985 Chevrolet I once drove when I worked for the State.  Over all, I do not like this car. However, I have not given up on Jag."
jaguar,xj-series,2005,xjr, 02/12/2007,If you like Jags,3,"Folks I am 6'2 220lbs, if you have my dimensions don't buy - you will always be uncomfortable in the bucket seats.  The car has a very attractive exterior, and the engine will blow anything away in its class, but lets face it folks this is a super ford, and everyone knows it.  Remember folks if you drive, and spend time in the car, prepare to hire a massage therapist for your back and thighs.  I can't wait to sell the damn car.  Just my thoughts."
jaguar,xj-series,2005,Ronnie, 08/17/2005,IAM SOLD,5,Iam sold to Jaguar for now on.  I first walked into the dealership telling myself that I wanted to purchase an S-Type but I took one look at the XJ and completely changed my mind.  The take off is awesome.  Its way faster than my Mercedes S430.  I love the low sports car feeling when I sit down in the front seats.  The car gives you a low feeling with high doors and a high center counsel.  The wood and leather are top notch and I love the carpet feeling of the headliner and pillars instead of that cheap threaded cloth that Mercedes uses.  Jaguar also updated this car with more hightech gadgets but didnt overdo it like BMW and Audi.  
jaguar,xj-series,2005,Jim, 01/04/2006,Best car I've owned,5,"The XJ8L is probably the best automobile I have owned.  Just drove it from Chicago to upstate NY and achieved almost 30 MPG!  The ride was great and engine performance excellent.  The interior is luxurious and spacious for road trips.   After owning two Mercedes Benz E series, I think I've found a winner!"
jaguar,xj-series,2005,Dan Derrick, 01/10/2006,Classy and Quick,5,"The Jaguar is a bit of a paradox. Folks look at the classic Jaguar appearance and make assumptions, but this aluminum XJ is light, quick and responsive.  The car handles well, and is comfortable.  The cabin has plenty of space, but it also retains a warmth and coziness that is unique to Jaguar"

jaguar,xj-series,2005,Tom, Boca Raton FL,One of the Best Cars I Have Owned,4,"After owning a Lexus and BMW, I decided 
to buy a Jaguar - VDP.  Excellent car 
in styling, comfort, reliablility, 
handling and dealer service.  In a 
Class of Its Own, The German & Japanese 
cars cannot compare."
jaguar,xj-series,2005,pjl275, 12/19/2004,Awesome Automobile,4,"This is one excellent machine. I 
cannot believe the power and 
smoothness of the engine and the ride 
comfort.  I paid less than $47k (left 
over '04) for a car that rivals the ""S"" 
Class and 7 Series. You cannot find a 
more elegant, distinguished car for 
the price.  It really turns heads.  I 
am having a tough time leaving it in 
parking lots and have yet to use it in 
the rain.  
Would not bother with the XJR, 294hp 
for a 3700lb car is over kill.  So far 
averaging about 20mpg which is 
impressive for this type of car.
Workmanship is top notch.  Interior 
style will make any other car look 
like a coal bin.
For less than the price of 5 Series or an 
A6, go find a deal on a Jag.  You'll 
love it."
jaguar,xj-series,2005,Stanley Langbein, 12/18/2004,XJ8,4,"It's good, the car is very fine, it's 
fun to drive, and accelerates very 
smoothly."
jaguar,xj-series,2005,Chris, 01/22/2005,2005 XJ8,5,"I have owned numerous luxury sedans (including other Jaguars), and this one certainly ranks near the top.  It is ""tight,"" quiet and responsive.  The ride is smooth, although not ""floaty.""  The interior is comfortable, and the seats conform well to my body. Having a rather long daily commute, I have already clocked approximately 12,000 miles. The only repair that I have had thus far was due to loose trim in the trunk. "
jaguar,xj-series,2005,Dr J Rapp, 03/08/2005,Third Time is the Charm,5,"Three weeks ago I took delivery of My XJ8. I had previously owned a 2002 X type which was so poorly built it made me (a grown man) want to cry. I then was foolish enough to go for an 04 X type on the word of the dealer that the car had been radically improved, which it was, but still shy of acceptable for a ""premium"" automobile, even an entry level one.I managed to convince myself that I had bought the wrong Jag and traded the X for a very svelt looking new XJ in Midnight Metalic Black. All I can say is that the XJ is a truely wonderful automobile in all respects. Day by day it continues to surprise me with it's comfort, cat like agility, outright speed and overall grace. "
jaguar,xj-series,2005,R. Anapolsky, 03/22/2005,jaguar KJ8,4,This is a wonderful automobile to drive. I can say without question it is the best auto that I have owned and driven in my nearly 50 years of driving.
jaguar,xj-series,2005,DrJRapp, 03/24/2005,I'm a believer,5,"After having two X Type Jaguars which I found to be nothing special, I took the plung and bought the big cat. I'm so glad I did, this is without a doubt the best car I've ever owned. Each day I discover new things to love about it. Most amazingly, it's big and it's quick and still gives me 22 MPG average (and I'm not a light foot)."

jaguar,xj-series,2006,soccercoach99, 06/05/2010,Best of the breed,5,"Jaguar got it right with this car, I have seven, including sports cars like Honda S2000 and Porsche Boxster, and American muscle car classic Impala SS -- the Jag does it all, quietly, composed, and quick. Can't imagine a more responsive and comfortable vehicle.  "
jaguar,xj-series,2006,oyahc, 06/03/2011,top notch,4,"I have owned this one for 3 years; it is awesome! I also have an XKR and an XKE. The power is incredible; it exudes luxury, and the maintenance has been minimal. "
jaguar,xj-series,2006,Carl A. Carreca, 10/27/2005,Jaguar - A Class by Itself,4,Jaguar has done it again. This car is by far the most elegant and at the same time sporty in the luxury car field. No other manufacturer offers a muscle luxury sedan with superb styling like Jaguar. I bought this car with Jaguar Racing Green exterior. It is really unique and the number of compliments I get on this car is amazing. It performs well at all speeds and handles like a dream even at well above the speed limit. It feels like a much smaller sports car as far as roadability is concerned but rides like a much larger car which it really is. So far only oil changes and tire rotations.
jaguar,xj-series,2006,jshrrh, 05/23/2013,It's the experience,4,"Found my low-miles little old man owned black-on-black beauty.
Drives like a dream, powerful, luxurious interior and a classic shape that makes a subtle statement that doesn't have to compete with the new swoosh shaped mobiles.

The luxury for value of this slightly older car is amazing.
Better still is the technology and appointments found in this car.
Folks are astounded when I tell them that my 300 ponies in this extravagant car gain me 28+mpg on the highway...
No need for an Optima.
Jag can, and do it like no other.
I compared Mercedes S500 (2005) when shopping and while I admire that car, its low fuel economy, complexity and lack of comparable character swing towards the Jag."
jaguar,xj-series,2006,J Hensing, 03/21/2008,Spectacular auto,5,Finest car I've owned.  Drives with great accuracy despite its size. Power is remarkable with smooth acceleration/shifts.  Rides beautifully and yet corners surefootedly.  Interior is truly luxurious including the sound system and the back seat AV DVD system.
jaguar,xj-series,2006,leapord06, 12/26/2010,One of the best,4," The cost of repairs after warranty is a drawback. The ride, Luxury, and beauty can not be denied. The road noise on back country roads is a bit much for this class of vehicle. On a smooth highway you could not complain, for it is as quiet as can be. My friends love the comfort of the back seat. 1 repair to a stopped up drain hose for the sun roof which allowed water into the rear rh floor board and had to go through the boot (trunk) cost $875.00 dollars. I would still buy another easily."
jaguar,xj-series,2006,socalh2oskier, 06/04/2008,Bargain Luxury?,4,"One of the quietest, smoothest rides you can find.  And, if you do your research, you can find genuine bargains.  I paid $33k for a 2006 with 18k miles, with an 84 month/75k mile warranty.  Seats are comfortable - this is one of the best cars you could ever have for a long trip.  Stereo is fantastic, nav is easy to operate, and bluetooth syncs easily with most phones.  Surprisingly, gas mileage is very good. I average 18-20 in the city, and 27-29 on the highway.  Handling, although far from sports-car like, is quite good. Overall, this is a fine car, much better than other cars in the same price range. "
jaguar,xj-series,2006,ken, 07/14/2008,Performance,5,"The comfort and performance of our 06 Jag XJL is well beyond everything we expected.  I have owned a Mercedes SL and this Jag responds much better in any type of driving.  I do not understand the low rating on MPG as after almost two years, I get at least 20 MPG around town and no less than 30 on the highway at 75+ MPH. More if I keep it under 70. "
jaguar,xj-series,2006,John, 08/17/2006,A fantastic car that could be even better,4,"This is a wonderful vehicle, that has excellent luxury and comfort and great performance.  It probably needs more power, as standard luxury cars are getting into the horsepower and 0-60 range of this car.  I understand that Jaguar can get 550 bhp out of this engine - what's stopping them.  An R version of this car should go 0-60 in 4.5 sec or less.  Other than these issues (and the car is incredibly fast, it just could go faster), the car is fantastic.  "
jaguar,xj-series,2006,Lloyd, 12/06/2005,Best XJ Yet!,4,"We have owned XJ Jaguars since early 80s. We loved the exterior style; were non plussed about the performance; but, suffered the interior dimensions. At 6' 4"" in height it was a challenge to fit myself into the driver's seat (not to mention two equally tall sons in the rear seats). Now almost everything has changed. This model is an extraordinary improvement. The interior is very spacious. More head room than even my height can use. A back seat that provides two 6' 2"" gentleman with more than ample leg, shoulder and head room. Incredible handling and driving performance. It is fast, silent and smooth. All the while, it has retained the Jaguar elegance which we have always appreciated."
jaguar,xj-series,2006,Leonard Johnson, 11/25/2015,Love my jaguar,5,"I owned a 98 XJ8 and  had lots of engine problems costly one but I was in and accident and if I was in any other car I wouldn't be here so I purchased a 2006 xJ8 and I'll say without a doubt! This is by far the best car I've ever owned and I've had many . Love it

jaguar,xj-series,2006,Sea Breeze, 07/20/2005,Love My Jag!,4,My husband surprised me w/my '05 XJ Vanden Plas N.Y.'s Eve.  This has been my dream car all of my life.   It drives like a dream.  It looks gorgeous and still turns my head.  
jaguar,xj-series,2006,Terry, 07/30/2006,Exceptionally nice car,5,I was very surprised at the increased room and comfort of this new body style while retaining the classic and timeless Jaguar styling.This car is gorgeous inside and out. Perfect fit and finish reflect the meticulous care that must have been used in the design and construction of this car. This car is truly excellent in every category I can think of and it is reasonably priced. It beats the competition by a mile!
jaguar,xj-series,2006,rhassm, 09/06/2008,XJ Offspring is wonderful!,4,"My wife inherited a XJ12C that I eventually restored.  I was aware of some of the older Jaguar ""mythology"".  As I restored this vehicle, the craftsmanship and engineering made an impression on me; however, the design and styling were the best.  After learning this older Jag, we could not stray too far from the classic style and comfort of Jaguar. The 2006 XJ L is a remarkable vehicle. We have experienced fuel economy greater than 25 mpg on the road, in some cases very close to 30 mpg.  The nimble comfortable ride make this vehicle a treat to drive.     "
jaguar,xj-series,2006,RAK, 01/05/2008,Slightly used Vanden Plas,5,"Recently bought a 2006 VDP which came fully loaded. The car is an absolute treat to drive, with a responsive, powerful engine that still gives good gas mileage. It is quiet and smooth, yet can take corners at speed. The interioir is a place of calm and comfort. I like this car very much. "
jaguar,xj-series,2006,Alan B, 02/25/2008,"Luxury & styling #1, reliability OK",4,"Drives great, very luxurious experience, especially on the inside.  Wife's favorite car. But understand you are buying the beauty and ride, not  reliability or longevity.  After 24 months had 3 recall/warranty items - didn't cost us a thing and Jag service was great!  Nevertheless never had those issues with my BMWs, MBs, or even my Escalade.  A fourth item, we paid $700 for rear brake pads/disks due to defective electronic parking brake no releasing fully (not covered).  All this in 24 mo.  If you love the car, recommend short lease 24-36 mo so you get it new.  If you're buying for the long term/holding onto, I'd rec'd something else.  But, we'll still get another one!"
jaguar,xj-series,2006,Rosalie Lynn Friedma, 07/30/2005,Outstanding Sedan...I love it!,4,"This automobile is luxurious in looks and the way it drives.  I am pleased with its interior, as well.  It is responsive on the road, and very easy to drive, and all comments received are very favorable.  I am proud to drive this vehicle, and enjoy owning it immensely.  I would recommend this car to anyone who wants to own a large, comfortable, prestigious automobile."
jaguar,xj-series,2006,shr100t, 05/07/2007,"Awesome, look no further",5,"I have driven Jags all my life and every time I buy a new one it only gets better, I now own a Super V8 and wow the power, the luxury - absolutely awesome. I would love to see in the next generation XJ a backup camera, to me this is all that is missing. The car is fun to drive, plenty of power and just so British, fit for a king. If you are thinking of owning one, go test drive one, before you waste your money on other luxury models, you won't be sorry. Happy motoring and enjoy."
jaguar,xj-series,2006,cg, 06/07/2007,Vanden Plas,4,"I absolutely love this car.  I have always thought it one of the most beautiful avaialable cars, but with the redesigns and the increased head room, they are there.  She is quiet, quick, incredibly nimble for a big car, and flat out nice to be in."
jaguar,xj-series,2006,CMH, 12/15/2018,Love my Jag,5,"If you have never driven this high performance type of vehicle before a Jaguar takes some getting used to due to nuances indigenous to this brand.  If you take care of this car regularly the car will provide you with a great ride (almost gliding over the road) and driving will be effortless as it will hug the road in all driving conditions.

jaguar,xj-series,2006,BMW enthusiast, 01/09/2006,XJ8,4,"As a long time multiple purchaser of 7 series BMW's, I stumbled onto this beautiful auto.  It is still to new to evalute for the long term, but what a wonderful highway drive and a reasonable performer.  Not a 7 series for performance, but more elegant looking and interior comfort unmatched by BMW or MB, and $20k less."
jaguar,xj-series,2006,Ronnie G, 03/23/2006,Classic Style,5,"I've been driving my new XJ8 for the past 3 months now and have been enjoying it ever since. I love the feeling of driving a car of this class, with its luxurious leather and wood and excellent Alpine sound system(worth the upgrade with the navi). The car feels big and important but at the same time feels very quick and sporty. The acceleration is super quick when merging on interstates and the car feels light when cruising. When driving, everything feels higher than your seated position giving a low, sporty feel, which is unique in a luxury car. I've bought my dream and I love every bit of it."
jaguar,xj-series,2006,Anthony G, 08/20/2005,BETTER THEN MERCEDES,4,"After having a S-Type and E-500, the Vanden Plas is by far the best car I have ever owned.  If your looking for a Jaguar go for the XJ8L or the Vanden Plas. Style, Comfort, Performance, and Touch Screen Navigation are great! This car also looks better then any Mercedes on the Road including the S-Class!"
jaguar,xj-series,2006,Michelle, 04/04/2006,Second VDP,4,"This is my second Vanden Plas!  I bought the 2004 in 2003 when they first came out with the aluminum body style.  I knew it would be hard to replace.  I test drove some Mercedes S class vehicles which had a lot of nice technology and fun features, but parked next to my 2004 Jaguar, the 2007 S550 exterior styling just didn't have any of the sexy lines like the Jaguar.  Just picked up my Midnight 2006 VDP with all the options.  Compared to my old silver one - people (especially guys) really stare.  The black with tinted windows and chrome wheels is very sharp! "
jaguar,xj-series,2006,Jag Man, 05/01/2006,Best XJ Ever !,5,The all new XJ with aluminum is without question the best improvement Jaguar ever made to this legendary car. Jaguar stands alone in looks for cars in this price range.  This JAG turns heads.  
jaguar,xj-series,2006,randy, 08/11/2006,Amazing,5,"The moment I drove this car home I realized this is an amazing vehicle. The ride is an absolute joy and the power and acceleration are great. The finish both interior and exterior are superb and are an example of how well made these cars are. The navigator is easy to use and I love the big screen. A group of 5-6 fellows commented to my wife and I as we were getting in the car. What a cool car, we are just admiring and drooling over it. The jag does look sharp and luxurious."
jaguar,xj-series,2006,My First Car, 07/14/2005,An Incredible Car,4,The Jaguar XJR was a gift to me from my father for my 16th birthday. It is my dream car of course next to the Rolls Royce. However the ride is amazing and the  heads turn when this baby come down the street. If i could change one thing it would be a gadget in the cabin that released the hood orniment and a brushed aluminum instead of wood option.
jaguar,xj-series,2006,trc468, 01/31/2008,Number 1 on the market,5,"I am back to Jag. It is like coming home to that smooth, comfortable and quite ride. Besides the XJ8's unmistakable classy exterior design, it offers the most beautiful interior on the market today.  With its 300HP, this car can preform as well.  It is tight and quick on it's feet. Great performance with a remarkable average of 19.4 MPG (mostly city driving). This is my third Jag since Y2000, and I can tell you these cars are extremely dependable!  Do not make the same mistakes by straying away to the other luxury brands.  Wow, it's great to be home!"
jaguar,xj-series,2006,The Rocket Ship, 01/11/2008,The Rocket Ship,5,The 2006 XJ Super V8 Portfolio is my 6th Jaguar and by far the best and my previous 5 Jaguars were terrific.  MB says that the S550 is a rocket ship.  Not true.  My wife owns an S550 and I can say from experience the 2006 Super V8 Portfolio is the true rocket ship.
jaguar,xj-series,2006,Barbara, 05/27/2005,A zippy Jaguar at last!!!,4,"This is our 3rd Jag, and this one is definitely the best, in performance and style.The all aluminum frame, the radar feature, and the double windscreen blades are a big improvement. "

jaguar,xj-series,2006,Will, 08/01/2005,Wonderful Driving Experience,5,"This is the most comfortable and best driving car that I have ever owned.  The Jaguar styling is distinctive and classical in every respect.  Unlike BMW and Mercedes, the instrument panel is not cluttered with complicated controls.  I have the long wheel base model--the rear compartment is almost livingroom-like.  For a car of this size and weight, milage is excellent; I have gotten almost 30 mph on the highway."

jaguar,xj-series,2006,Ernani, 10/18/2019,Nobody Does It Better... Simply The Best,5,"I have owned four Jaguar sedans and the 2006 Vanden Plas is the epitome of ride, handling and overall excellence. I don't care for the current body style since Ta Ta took over Jag. This model is the last of the classic Jaguar smooth lines and four headlight models. This car is a pleasure to drive and there is nothing else that compares. The interior cabin is like a fine gentlemen's club with soft leather and beautiful wood trim. The car makes you smile every time you drive it. If you do proper maintenance and take care of this car it will run 350K miles with no trouble. So well crafted and such a dream to drive... no other car like it. If you can find one go get it... you'll love it.

jaguar,xj-series,2007,Brian Mac, 02/27/2017,Stunning Big Cat!,5,"Incredibly smooth and quiet ride.  Surprisingly quick and nimble for a car of this size.  Far more class and comfort for far less money than comparable German cars when purchased preowned.  Reliability has been flawless for the 10,000 miles I have owned it.  Took a road trip and drove 23 hours with fuel stops only and found this car does not wear you out even after hours behind the wheel.  LOVE THIS CAR!!!
08/31/2017-Owned 1-1/2 years & 20,000 miles now. I get bored with cars quickly, trade every year or two for something different. However, not this one. I still get excited to jump in for a weekend cruise thru the mountains or down the coast of New England. I own an auto repair shop so I know cars pretty well and this one is proving to be much more reliable than the German counterparts owned by my customers. It rides infinitely smoother and quieter. During spirited driving it may not corner quite as well as well as a BMW however, for a car this large it comes close. I would take the ride quality over the cornering agility any day. Reliability has been very good with a thermostat replacement being the only repair in the 20,000 miles I have owned it. What a pleasure to drive...and even at 10 years old it still turns heads everywhere I go!
03/01/2018- I must say I am still absolutely in love with this car. Again reliability has remained excellent with no repairs needed since my last review. Car still rides limo smooth & quiet. Looking forward to another year with my Jag!
09/04/2018- Here we are with another year passed. My Jaguar XJ8 of course is still running & driving as it did when I first purchased it in February 2016. Now at 83,000 miles I replaced all filters, fluids & spark plugs. I did replace the alternator due to a whine noise and will soon replace the battery as a preventative item as it is now 5 years old, although it has not caused any issues and it still test OK. Gotta say I still love this car!

jaguar,xj-series,2007,Mike , 03/05/2007,Purrfect!,4,"I purchased a 2007 XJ VP and find this car to be an absolute joy to drive. For the first time in owning most other prestige makes, I have finally found a vehicle that I am proud to own. The XJ VP interior is total comfort and the finish quality is unbeatable. Despite its size, the 300 HP V8 and all-alloy body makes this car surprisingly quick and it handles almost like a sports car. Thank you Jaguar!  After so many years I am enjoying the experience of driving again."
jaguar,xj-series,2007,Underrated, 06/27/2007,Underrated,5,"After owning almost every other premium import sedan over the last 20 years, I finally bought the XJ8L Jag. What a surprise. It may be sold as a luxury sedan, but it performs like a sports sedan. Quick reflexes without the hard ride. Comfortable seats, tons of room and excellent mileage. Plus its straightforward interior controls and ergonomics beat BMW and MB to death. Its sad that this car is not considered by more enthusiasts drivers wanting luxury as icing. "
jaguar,xj-series,2007,rEgan P, 10/04/2018,Big Kitty performs better than expected,5,"Incredibly affordable high end luxury car, drives much better than expected for such a large vehicle.  Comfort is exceptional, driving experience is amazing, passenger amenities are plentiful.  Fabulous build quality, exceptional materials.  Pros: It's a Jaguar, it's inexpensive to acquire, rides, drives and performs very well at the high levels expected or even beyond expectations.  Luxurious ride, and the 'ford years' of Jaguar are known for reliability.  Cons: repairs can be expensive, terribly thought out and not very well supported NAV system, only valid through 2012... one expects more 'ongoing support' from Jaguar than 5 years on a Nav system.  Purchase price was $9,500, put additional funds in to repairs and restoration to bring it back to factory, including utilizing Jaguar dealership which was helpful, courteous, professional, and well, expensive.  ALL in on vehicle to get a very high quality restored daily driver is just under $16k

Years on, the car is still a daily driver.  There have been a few issues with electrical systems like the passenger side automatic door lock failing and the front and rear sensors not always functioning as they should.  The car still is very luxurious, although modern cars have caught up and surpassed the technology on this 2007.  (13 years on, I would hope so!)  Many modern cars at lower trim levels still do not have the technology this car does have.

Drives like a dream, handles incredibly well for such a big car.  Keep up on maintenance in order to keep yearly repair costs down, insure you are using correct oil for example.  Good bit of used parts on eBay and secondary markets.  Not always easy to find a Jaguar dealership unless you are in a major city.
"
jaguar,xj-series,2007,John , 06/30/2009,A beauty!,5,A beautiful car inside and out. A very British look makes heads turn when you drive it.  Smooth powerful engine that gets excellent gas mileage - typically 28mpg highway driving. Navi system a bit difficult to use and has a great display.    
jaguar,xj-series,2007,Patty, 05/17/2008,Same Drive as VP,4,"I have owned a Jaguar since 2002. I first purchased the Vanden Plas, which I still have. The just recently purchased the XJ8 LWB, which drives even better (maybe because it is newer), but never the less, the drive is smooth. The luxury is to die for and it is an overall showstopper, head rocker.  This car is not cheap on the wallet, but classy in the street and when you need to get there, (your there).  If it is luxury you want, this Jaguar is what you need, if you are worried about your wallet a (Pinch Buggy) is what you need. The question is which is more important, for me it was the drive, the look and the dependability, and Jaguar has all of these. "
jaguar,xj-series,2007,HiSport, 08/09/2019,Road Warrior...,5,"Love my 2007 dark green XJR!
Just finished another 6,200 mile cross country trip - my fourth in three years of ownership - and can honestly say that this Jag is perhaps the best car I've ever owned. Please know that I've been a life long fan of high end German sedans - particularly 7 series BMW and 8 series Audi, along with various Mercedes models and many Porsches. I bought the Jag on a whim, just because it was so damn good looking (disclaimer: this is generally an ill advised approach with cars, women, and many other things). At first, it seemed that all the old Jag scare stories were true. The rear air suspension collapsed on the return leg of my first cross country trip; steering and handling were loose and rattled over bumps. I could smell coolant when the car was parked. And, etc, etc...
What the car needed - at 85K miles and 10 years - was refitting. This is actually no different than German sedans. My advice if you're in the XJ market is to buy the best example you can find (with big preference to late '06 and '07 US X356 models), then plan to spend another $6K - $10K in refurb parts. Double this if you're not a DIY'er. 
When you're done, you'll have a taut, comfortable, and classy vintage Jag. My strong preference, aesthetically, is the short wheelbase models, with a nod to the supercharged, 400HP XJR (or softer riding SWB Super v8 model). Early (X350; '04 and '05) models have too many problems, though cheap and plentiful (the most expensive Jag you can buy is a cheap one). The last production years ('08 and '09) lost their good looks in an ill advised face lift. 
The X356 XJR is a bonafide sports sedan, with unmatched kick down punch on the highway (my last sedan was an M5 BMW; with an S8 Audi before that). Ride is taut but comfortable; handling is not in Audi and BMW leagues, but pretty close. Gas mileage on my latest trip was ~ 23 MPG overall

And, people love this car. So do I. It is both beautiful and fairly unique; a real head turner, and a joy to drive...

jaguar,xj-series,2007,Paul F., 10/14/2006,Beautiful Car,5,"It may not appeal to the more contemporary types, but the Jaguar XJ8 is the most satisfying luxury sedan money can buy. It has style, it has ultra-luxury and comfort, it has unshakable ride quality, a silky-smooth 300hp V8 mated to a fantastic six-speed automatic, and all the features anyone would ever want or need. All in all, if you don't want your average BMW or Mercedes, this is the car to get."
jaguar,xj-series,2007,Marvin, 03/03/2018,Embarrassingly joyful to own,5,"More than you expect! Beautiful style; friends, relatives, casuals can't help but comment in envying way. Fast; minimal repairs in my 9 yrs. ownership. Over 20 mpg really!  It's now 12 model yrs. old and don't know if i should look for a newer vehicle or take my chances going forward, knowing how costly Jag repairs can be.  For now, staying pat. PS. Handles and accelerates like a sports car. Should be sold as a luxury sports sedan. Still on my original tires.  Finally chsnged tires (costco had a good sale,  so couldn't resist getting my girl a new pair of shoes).  Continues to get admiring looks from others.

jaguar,xj-series,2008,gmayfield, 03/01/2011,Wonderful Jag !,4,"Very fun to drive.
 Not sure about reliability as
it only has 14k miles.
 Drives like a dream & very responsive handling and acceleration.
2 quirks I will mention:
No back-up camera in navigation system. ""beep"" signal
is very adequate though
Rear seat headrests hinder rear outward vision
TREMENDOUSLY !!!
 I wish they could flip down
out of the way or could be removed easily.
The headrests enlarge the blindspots on both sides, therefore you must rely heavily on rear view side
mirrors when changing lanes.
Make sure mirrors are adjusted correctly or you WILL
cut someone off when changing lanes.
Otherwise,
one of my most memorable cars to
drive & to look at."
jaguar,xj-series,2008,J. Lo Re (Florida), 11/24/2007,"Jaguar Vanden Plas (Boca Raton, FL)",4,This car is an absolute dream to drive with a ton of features and a new sportier exterior design in the 2008 model.  The interior is beautifully crafted with 2 tone leather seats and elm wood finish.  The car just handles extremely smooth and is very comfortable with a long body for tall passengers in the back seat.  The drive is very luxurious while it has a feeling of plenty of power (I have the 300 HP version) since the aluminum design makes it lighter than ever.  It just handles very well overall and corners extremely well.  I have had 2 BMWs previously and this stacks up extremely well (maybe a tad better) to BMW.
jaguar,xj-series,2008,Gray Jag, 01/23/2010,Mercedes Beater,5,"I recently bought a Mercedes, trading in mY Range Rover, as I travel long distances on business. After 500 miles I realized it was uncomfortable and poorly built. I then bought my Certified XJ8L and have since put 3000 fast, quiet comfortable miles on the car in three weeks. Although a (very) big car, with room for the times I take my teenage kids, it's aluminium construction means it takes corners quickly, stops quickly and has reasonable gas mileage. It's classic looks in Pearl Gray always attract attention and it stands out from the generic luxury sedan look. The car gives me great pleasure. If you are looking for a light, fast luxurious car, you should try one."
jaguar,xj-series,2008,Mark in Oregon, 01/02/2020,Styling. Power. Luxry interior. Reliability.,5,"Afer two 2004 XJ's (x350), I finally found a 29k mile 2008 Vanden Plas recently in 2019.  Let me share my experience from the two 2004's and current 2008.

As my title states, these cars are truly outstanding in all key areas.  Nothing on the road these days as distinctive as the x350 Jaguars.  Performance is outstanding with either the 300 or 400 horsepower models.  The 300hp version does 0-60 in under 7 seconds and yet gets gas mileage of around 28 mpg highways and 24 mpg city.  

Jaguar interiors are unlike any other car except maybe Rolls Royce and Bentley offerings.  All the aromatic leather, real walnut trim, lambs wool carpets, and the comfort Jaguar offers are of first class treatment.

Reliability is quite impressive (read other reviews), and the only major weak points are as follows:

Suspension on these cars is an air controlled system which over time will definity need replacing as the rubber components wear.  When replacing, you will want to use the Arnott after market version which will last much longer than the factory version and afford a slightly firmer ride.  The total cost to replace both front and rear components (by a qualified non-dealer facility) will run about $3k.  

The only other costly replacement is the Xenon headlamps found on some of these cars.  Each headlight unit is a complete piece with bulbs and housing.  Cost for each to replace is about $12-15 hundred dollars.

I give this car 5 stars because after owning three of them, my experience with each has been superb.

Note:  The 2008 and 2009 editions offered a much more aggressive body treatment and firmer ride.  While the same length they are slightly taller and a bit more roomy.  They also came standard with 18 inch wheels on the base models and 19 and 20 inch wheel options were available, with the 19 inch being standard on the Vanden Plas editions.

Happy hunting for the car of your dreams!

I believe this car is the best combination of performance and comfort on the market today. Easy to use touch screen navigation and Blue Tooth communications, (no annoying iDrive). New, more comfortable seats in the 2008 (traded an '04 XJR). Also cabin is much more quiet than previous models.     "
jaguar,xj-series,2008,AustinWest, 11/15/2018,08 XJ8 L,5,"I have owned many cars over the years and this one is by far my favorite. I currently have 130k miles and climbing every day. The only repairs made to this car in 10 years are a replaced coolant reservoir (that i was able to replace myself for less than $200) and I replaced the front control arms for around $1500. Engine, transmission and everything else is original and runs like new. Quick acceleration, excellent braking and the fuel economy is insane for a big V8 sedan. I get around 20-25 mpg in the city and have seen well into the 40's on the highway. Each tank I average almost 27mpg. The style of this car is timeless. People stop and stare at it all the time. The pearl grey paint color is a real eye-catcher. The car is also incredibly ahead of its time. Heated and cooled seats. Heated steering wheel. Navigation and bluetooth all work well. The sound system is fantastic. Handling is a dream. Charming and sophisticated around the city but can scream and squeal tires if you really want to. I really have no complaints. This car will hopefully make it to my dying day.

Looks like something from a custom shop. The 20 inch 5 spoke cremona wheels and ground effects give a real aggressive stance. Test drove mercedes, audi and BMW. These sedans don't even approach the interior class or the road performance of this rare machine.  And I do mean rare, few are being built, is a plus. As prior owners of a M5 series BMW, this jag is leaps and bounds above the rest.  And the supercharged V8, is faster than audi, mercedes and BMW, but 26 miles per gallon on the highway, no gas gusler tax on this cat, unlike the other three tested."

jaguar,xj-series,2008,David, 10/15/2018,"Truly, ‚ÄúThe Blending of Art and Machine‚Äù!",5,"Owning an iconic Jaguar XJ Series is not only a very wise decision, but an honor. No other motorcar exudes the timeless class, distinction, dependability, value and sheer driving pleasure that the XJ so firmly commands.

My 2008 XJ8L makes my heart swoon every time I see it. Once inside, every one of my sences is hightened by its sheer beauty, engineering and driving performance.

My XJ8L was fitted with most every option available. It‚Äôs gorgeous curvaceous Emerald Green Metalic exterior (which looks black at night, like having two different vehicles), chrome front grill (upper & lower) combined with the classic round headlights and fog lights, distinctive Jaguar side vents, extended front and rear bumpers, rear trunk spoiler and 19‚Äù chrome wheels; perfection! Inside, the ultra-luxurious cream leather with mocha piping and trim, Walnut burlwood dash, trim & shift knob, real chrome accents throughout and the expansive rear seating which comes with the ‚ÄúL‚Äù long-wheelbase feels like I‚Äôm in a 5 star gentleman‚Äôs club.

My favorite and most used options are the front and rear heated and cooled seats, premium sound system, navigation system and the cruise control. 

This motorcar drives just like it looks, like a gorgeous sure-footed, nimble and powerful cat, always ready to strike. The cabin is so quiet, it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre standing still; but, put your foot on the gas and this cat growls into high speed, leaving others in the dust.

The combination of modern technology and classic styling strike a perfect balance, something that is rarely found. A+

Be sure you're ready to pay the ""Jag tax"" for ownership.  In other words it is very expensive to maintain.

Brakes, $1000 unless you have Brembo, then it's double that number.

jaguar,xk,2009,Frank, 05/28/2018,The Jag to have!,4,"Great styling and performance in that classic Jag silhouette.  I chose the coupe over the convertible because quite frankly it has a much better ass.  The convertible is fine if you live in south Florida and have an enlarged prostate, but it just lacks the appeal of the coupe.  This is a true GT give speed and comfort, with a decent amount of rigidity and stability with traction control on.  If you want a wild ride, hold the traction control button for 10 seconds to disengage the control and go easy in the first curve!!!  Acceleration is amazingly quick.  The paddle shift is instantaneous. The huge front discs provide more than adequate braking without any signs of fade, any the new rigid all aluminum frame keeps everything feeling taut.  The interior has the classic Jaguar burled wood and plush supportive leather seats which can be adjusted 12 different way from Sunday to fit most any height and stature.  The back seat, while looking nice serves no real practical purpose.  Space is so limited you couldn't fit a legless dwarf back there.  The coupe does have a usable trunk which will fit a couple of full size luggage or 2 sets of golf clubs.  There are a few things to be concerned with on this vehicle.  They are known to have sticky thermostats which are not difficult to change out yourself.  Mine would generally stick in colder weather if the car wasn't warmed up for a few minutes before taking it out.  This demonstrated a dashboard warning.  After speaking to the dealer he told me to just buy an error code scanner and eliminate the code if it comes up repeatedly.  Also, be careful not to leave this car out in the sun as a habit.  The dashboard leather will shrink and start to pull away!!!  Get a dashboard cover or reflector.  There is no easy fix for this. Your looking at a close to $4000 repair (to have it done right).  All in all this is a fantastic car which was designed by the same person who designed the Aston Martin DB7-9.  They are virtually identical, but i think the Jag has a certain amount of flair and refinement that you won't get in the AM.  I love this XKR and will most probable have it for a very long while.

You name it and I've owned it; muscle cars, sports cars, luxury sedans, SUV's and yes even a pick up. I was looking for a new convertible; I did all my research and knew I would be driving a Jag. As I walked in the dealership, there was a beautiful coupe sitting on the show room floor. It was ""love at first sight""!I Forgot the convertible and took the coupe for a ride. I drove it home that day. For me, everything is right about this car. The fit and finish are all about quality both inside and out. The ride is comfortable yet firm and reassuring.

One test drive, okay two test drives and I could not leave the dealership without having one. It took a few months since I wanted the '09 but I am thrilled.  It's fast, it's beautiful, it's comfortable and the envy of the neighborhood. Very technologically advanced. Modern looking but still very Jaguar.

It had 25,000+ miles but looked and drove like brand new.
I had a 2 day trip from Detroit, where I bought the car, back to DFW, Texas.
The responsiveness of the throttle is simply amazing...even with ""only"" 385hp.. LOL.
The fit and finish are outstanding.
The suspension is a bit firm, but I guess that's the price you have to pay for such performance and handling.
I generally get 18mpg on my commute to work and got 22+mpg on the road trip in from Michigan.

The sat radio does seem to drop out quicker than my Lexus, but the audio response of the Bowers and Wilkins system is amazing.
Truly a great car."
jaguar,xk,2010,richnota, 08/24/2010,Amazing XK,4,Drove 300 mile round trip to country every weekend as well as a daily city commute. The XK never needed anything except a new wiper blade.  Biggest problem was keeping it under speed limit. The car is most happy cruising at 80-90 mph.  Direction headlights are perfect for country roads.
jaguar,xk,2010,bruno, 04/11/2010,Sexy look and Sport,4,"I finally purchased a 2010 XKR Coupe, after testing Mercedes E63 AMG, BMW Ms, Audi S5/6.. My wife immediately felt in love when she saw it ""It's like an Ashton Martin !"" she told me, yep we know why, same designer. That was a good start! But not enough for me. On paper the specifications are already very impressive, but it's really when you start to drive it that you realize what it really means. This car has it all ! It can be very soft and you can feel like in a lounge, but in a minute later, you switch on the ""S"" mode, press the accelerator, and you truly have a race car, and you can't believe you are already over speed limit (noises very well filtered). An eye catcher for sure!"
jaguar,xk,2010,Andrew, 11/26/2009,"Oh, My - What a Car!!",4,"Wow!  My salsa red  supercharged convertible with black interior started to turn heads right inside the dealership.  I knew I was getting something special when I pushed the ""Start"" button and the Jag emitted a roar like a supersonic boom, only to become whisper-quiet as the gear-changing knob raised up from the console.  As I was driving home, the 510 hp was unlike anything I've driven before.  The car responds like a rocket!  With minimal gas it accelerates before you have time to blink again emitting the unmistakable Jag roar.  The handling is amazing!  The style is to die for  - it is the best- looking car out there!  Almost everything about this car is top-notch.  "

Ian Callum (Use to be with Aston Martin, now designs the latest jags?) , job well done."
jaguar,xk,2010,Dr. Katz, 08/14/2016,150 is like a walk in the park,5,"This car positively devours miles on long road trips. I picked up mine used in NYC and immediately drove it home to Oregon. Amazing drive back through a combination of interstate and back road highways. Very stable all the way up to 155 where the speed limiter puts an end to the locomotive pull. It is surprisingly quiet with the top up. With it down, the optional wind screen with the windows rolled up makes for a very calm cabin at speed. Seats are comfortable even on very long trips. Corners great at all speeds. The paddle shifters work well and are quick and responsive. Brakes scrub off big speed nicely. Active exhaust sound cool when bypassing muffler. You can get two kids (probably up to age 14)  in the back but both the driver and passenger need to move the seats up quite a bit. Trunk is one of the smaller I have seen. Back seats make better storage than seats. I've so far put 5K miles on it (in about 3 weeks)and blew out a CV boot ($450 repair). I'm guessing it had something to do with many trips deep into triple digits. Other than that, its been good so far.

jaguar,xk,2010,dirtdoc1, 11/11/2009,Short Term Review,4,"Performance: With 510hp & peak torque at 2500rpm with the CATS system disabled, it is hard to keep the back wheels from spinning while the rear end kicks out. Anymore power would be a waste. Interior is all stitched leather, suede and wood. It reminds me of a Ferarri inside. Not many bells and whistles and NO VOICE ACTIVATION!! This car is all about performance, which is why it is surprising that they did not use racing pedals and steering wheel. The auto door lock does not work, which is why I gave it a 6 for reliability. The engine is covered with plastic - very cheezy! The back seats are for CD's. This car is fun to drive and fun to look at. It is a rocket on rails, Jag should be proud!"

jaguar,xk,2010,Thomas Rinkach, 09/14/2015,Weeee!,5,"Plenty of ""giddy-up-go"" with the normally aspirated engine (385 hp.). Ride is a bit stiff not silky smooth as the sales brochure implies, but then again it's a sport-touring vehicle. Interior is superb. The car is classed as a Portfolio edition with some extra options. There is no oil dipstick - electronic readout on dash. Trunk is a bit tight, hard to get one set of golf clubs in it. Uses plastic head lamp covers as compared to my '05 XK8 glass ones (tacky plastic that'll likely get yellowed, glazed & scratched in time). No sunglass compartment built into left side of dash as there was in my '05 XK8. Reliable, well built & gorgeous design - a real head turner. Classy car & well balanced simple design. Had local dealer program ""daylight running lights"" on for safety. Now trying to see if a rearview camera can be installed. Overall, I love it even though it has no variable utility other than getting from point A to point B in style...I use my '14 GMC Terrain for grunt duty. Just bought a ""T"" shirt: ""YOU CAN'T BUY HAPPINESS, BUT YOU CAN BUY A JAGUAR XK AND THAT'S KIND OF THE SAME THING""

The Jags looks trumped the others but I wasn't sure about the chassis and performance of the new 5.0 engine.Well I absolutely love this car! I have owned many sports cars but this car is a stunner. Performance is spectacular, torque is outstanding, and I have averaged 19 mpg on the first 1,800 miles.  The sound system is incredible and the Bowers & Wilkins speakers are as good as it gets. Truly a world class touring car. A car that can be pussy cat to drive or a ""scalded cat"" on demand. "

The car design is amazing (in particular with the 20 Inch Wheels), and while it's really fast, it's never brutal. The interior filters very well the exterior noises. The seats are top notch and you can easily find your perfect driving position. You can drive for hours and not getting tired. The brakes are very strong (expected !). So far my mileage is 17 mpg Avg. (No gas Guzzler Tax compare to the E63 AMG) A fantastic GT, and an eye catcher (same designer than Ashton Martin)"

Oil change and engine review cost $179. Car requires one oil change per year. The lines of the car are perfect and the look is very distinctive versus those of MBZ, BMW and Audi. The looks blow the German competitors away.

I can't begin to tell everyone out there how amazing this car is. Had a 2007 on a 2 year lease a few years back and that was just the 300hp XK. I thought that car was wicked. How wrong I was. Never has so much power been combined with such grace. Great looks, flat out astounding performance, and finally I feel like a rock star again. Can't wait to go to work in the morning. Can't wait to go anywhere in this car. Wow. Love it."
jaguar,xk,2011,PRI, 11/20/2010,Better than I had hoped!,4,"This is the best car I have ever owned and that includes a lot of great cars (even a new 1974 XKE convertible). Before I bought it, I compared it to test drives of the MB SL 500, the Porsche Carrera and BMW 650I. The XKR won the comparison easily IMO. The acceleration from any speed is awesome. People are always pulling-up alongside to tell me how great it looks and sounds! Better city mileage than the 2008 BMW 750I I had before this car. Much simpler to operate than a BMW. I wanted a fantastic GT and now I have one. Jaguar's motto of ""Grace with Pace"" says it all. I will keep this car forever!"

Although no major issues at all when even there is anything minor such as a small blemish on the leather dash, jaguar replaces the whole dash at no charge.

Trust me!"
jaguar,xk,2012,R.T. Manske, 12/27/2016,Best GT Sports Car for the money,4,"The Jaguar XK series 2012 - 2015 are beyond beautiful, very dependable, ultra comfortable and a pleasure to drive.  No other grand touring sports car comes close to the now discontinued XK or XKR for value.  The new F Type is a great sports car too, but many of us prefer the larger XK for a comfortable daily driver that can still pin you back into the seats with awesome acceleration and great handling.  Very few drivers are skilled enough to take this car to it's limits.  I didn't give it 5 stars only because of the outdated electronics and navigation program.  Everything else is classic Jaguar grand touring luxury with more room than the new F type.  The XK's went out of production after 2015 and the 2012 through 2015 cars are an exceptional value today compared to anything in it's class.   Find a well cared for, low mileage XK series car and keep it forever.  You will be glad you did.

jaguar,xk,2012,67es335, 05/01/2013,"XKRS - After 1 Year, Still Exciting!",5,"No rattles or repairs. I've had it on the track twice. Each time was a full day and there is still life in the P zeros! The car loves to be driven on the track hard. No break fade or overheating, it just wants more! On the street it is not high strung or difficult to drive but very smooth and easy. The stability control system in track mode is so liberal that I can't tell the difference from track mode and full off! The car sticks like it has glue on the tires but it does have snap over-steer and needs to be driven with respect if you intend to drive with the traction control in track mode of off (not!). The rear end can be very light and twitchy but that is part of what makes it exciting!

A couple of years later:

I traded the XKRS in for an F Type R. The F Type R is a far better sports car but the XKRS is a great GT car. I miss the XKRS. The back seats were very convenient. I never had a problem with the car during my 3 years of ownership. The problem with the XKRS is the snap over-steer. If you leave the stability control system on the car is perfectly safe and fun to drive. Jaguar has a way of making their cars feel special. When ever I get in and start getting the car ready to drive I can feel my heart step up a beat with excitement. It's really hard to put your finger on what exactly makes driving a Jaguar exciting. My Father's BMW 740 didn't do that for me and neither has any other car that I have driven. I guess that's why I keep buying Jaguars. A neighbor from down the street asked me if I worked for Jaguar because of all the different Jaguars that he has seen in front of my house. I said no I just like them.
"
jaguar,xk,2013,67es335, 01/02/2013,XKRS sports car or GT?,4,It does a pretty good job of being both but it is too heavy to be a true sports car but it can keep up! I've owned both the XKR and XKRS. The XKRS took care of almost all of the handling issues that I had with the XKR. But it is still prone to swapping ends and it gives you almost no notice that it's going to break loose. It sticks really good but when the stick is gone you have to be very good at drifting to catch it. Otherwise it is probably one of the best GT cars ever! Turn-in is great. It would be nice if it had a bit less torque. You have to be very careful with the gas to keep the wheels from spinning. I think most people that buy Jags would be happier with the XKR for that reason.
jaguar,xk,2013,Bernard, 05/16/2018,This Jag Rocks,5,"I love it. My wife is so bored listening to me talk to people about it. Bottom line, the Jaguar X KR has an elegance to it that turns heads. Little kids notice it. People can't help but appreciate the sweetness, appearance, and timelessness of it's design. And it sounds great too. The power, 515 hp, is a given. The color is ""Midnight black"" and has flecks of blue throughout. If you're considering purchasing one, enjoy!

It is still stylish, but admittedly it is looking a little more like a ""classic"" than a fresh design at this point.  I have the ultimate black and it has a beautiful sparkle to it (but really likes to be clean).  The things I do not like are the audio options (no aux and no bluetooth, boo!), the cabin is a little tight (I am 6'2"", 200lb), and the maintenance costs are just the price of owning a Jaguar.

The driving dynamics are very luxurious and the exterior and interior are nothing short of beautiful; the coupe gets a lot of looks and head-turns.  The power is ample and the torque is nice and low RPM.  The real power comes in once you're at about 40mph and slam on the gas, all the while it feels smooth, linear, and effortless.  Had one problem with the cooling system (was a common problem) and cost me $500; I have had no problems since then aside from a malfunctioning CD changer.

jaguar,xk-series,2000,Smith, 02/12/2016,The Diamond in the Dirt,5,"Gotta love a ""Sports car"" with rear seats.  I own a 2000 XK8 and let me just say, these cars are even more stunning in person and the coupes are in a league of their own look-wise, even by today standards.  As long as you work out the few little problems the earlier models 97-00 had before they go wrong, in specific, having the cam tensioners upgraded to aluminum which shouldn't cost more than $1k installed or just buying a newer model 01-06, then these cars have have pretty decent reliability.  At least more so than Jaguars reputation of the 80's would suggest, before Ford took over things in I want to say '89? Either way, if your reading this and end up getting one, just be prepared for all the compliments it's going to get.  Also jokes aside, it's not technically a sports car because of the rear seats but if you have kids or people to haul, the rear seat really are next to usless.

The scare tactics that other dealers told us were all lies. We have had nothing but wonderful experiences with our Jags. In fact, I have been more satisfied with our 4 Jags than any of our Toyotas or Hondas or Lexus vehicles (which we still own as utility vehicles).

jaguar,xk-series,2001,sporter, 04/07/2002,Jag XK8 Great Drive!,4,"I LOVE this car.  It's even better thanI 
thought it would be!

I bought the car because I've always 
admired the Jaguar look.  I expected 
that driving the car wouldn't be as 
great an experience as looking at it.  
But I was wrong - driving is just as 
enjoyable!

For my money, the Jaguar XK is far 
and away the best looking (late 
model) convertible available.  For it to 
be as great to drive (short or long 
distances) is a bonus that makes 
the car impossible to beat."
jaguar,xk-series,2001,mercedes1, 02/21/2005,2001 XK8,4,"I considered models of four cars I have owned in the past. Namely Porsche 993, Mercedes SL500, Corvette and another 993/996. This time I bought an XK8 after due consideration. It had 14,000 miles on it. I probably would not have bought it except that because they depreciate so fast I got one for just over 30K. I am favorably impressed with the car. It combines a gorgeous sports car look with pretty good performance, very good gas mileage (26 mpg hghway), good ride and handling and a lot of creature comforts.  Since my wife liked the car at test drive time it was an easy sell for me. No complaints."
jaguar,xk-series,2001,Mike, 03/25/2016,Enjoyment.,4,"This car has proven to be comfortable and reliable. I only wish that I had stepped up to a Jaguar earlier than I did and I would recommend this car to anyone interested in a convertible.

I've had problems with the driverside rear alignment due to the fact the car was hit and repaired prior to my purchase, which I did not know about. Once this is corrected, I do believe it will be excellent. I look forward to trading in a year or so for a 2007. Like the retractable top, not keen on the lact of trunk space. Not much room for golf clubs. :) "

jaguar,xk-series,2001,Jag Believer, 02/28/2002,I took a chance and won!,5,"I never considered the XK8 until my first up close look. Even with the top up, four can fit comfortably, yet snuggly, if you simply adjust the front seats to accommodate the legroom in the back.

I got caught in a snowstorm and romped on it to see how it handled and I was quite impressed. You can&#8217;t get the wheels to spin unless you deselect traction control. 

I highly recommend forgetting the rest for anyone wanting a true world class rag top, particularly if a two seater just won&#8217;t do."

I would expect seats that are firm but comfortable, with good lower back support and stiff side bolsters to hold you in place around corners.  Instead, Jag uses soft, uncomfortable  seats that deny a driver the pleasure of experiencing the car's capabilities...Try to going around a corner at anything but granny speed and you'll end up on the other side of the car!

I've never owned a Jaguar but after an exhaustive search for a luxurious coupe and being open to just about anything, I could not find anything out there in a reasonable price range until I started researching the 1997-2006 Jaguar XK series.
It took a while to find the right one, but I finally found a black on black coupe for sale in Philadelphia.
I drove it 1500 miles over a weekend back to Minnesota and absolutely love everything about it.
Power, handling, comfort, luxury and the most unique and
beautiful styling I've ever seen.

jaguar,xk-series,2002,peregryne, 03/12/2007,A terrific vehicle,4,"This car is a blast to drive, it handles really well, and has good acceleration.  Unfortunately I haven't been able to verify the top speed :), but at high speeds it's still very smooth and quiet.  The convertible top produces little noise, and looks great from inside. Jaguar reliability is much better than it used to be, and the AJ-V8 engine and ZF tranny are a very solid combination.  Research the timing chain tensioners however, esp. on pre-2000 models.  Oil changes are very easy thanks to intelligently-situated filter and drain.  Good amount of trunk space, but the back seat is all but useless for moving people."
jaguar,xk-series,2002,Les, 04/16/2007,2002 Jaguar XKR,4,"After 30 years of driving, this is by far the best driving car I have owned.

Very satisfied with reliability and efficient warranty repair and maintenance program. "
jaguar,xk-series,2002,Lynda, 05/20/2018,Parade Worthy,4,"This fantastic model is no longer made, the body style is a classic. For a high performance car fuel economy is great.

I wanted a fine luxury convertible for weekend driving with room for 2 suitcases or sets of golf clubs. There are only a few vehicles in this class but the others are set up for racing and I wanted a smoother ride. The XKR has the power and performance in a league with the 500 SL Mercedes and the Porsche but the ride and features of a fine luxury car. It is perfect the perfect mix for me.

Can't do it with the new cool hard/convertible tops down. Top down, trunk space gone. I really like the clean look of the new disappearing hard convt tops but not at the expense of the trunk. I use this car to take to the coast or mountains for vacation and pleasure driving. It has a large trunk and is very powerful, comfortable. I will not be getting a new one due to the trunk space issues.  "

great ride, always garners stares and

side bolster support whatsoever...take 
a left corner at anything above granny

She said she always wanted one, and she couldn't believe it when it ""appeared"" in the driveway 2005 Xmas a.m! She drives it everyday. This is ""our"" 2nd Jaguar; had an '89 XJS coupe (V12) previously - what an improvement since Ford took over.  The '03 is wonderful: 4.2 engine is buttery smooth, and not as fragile as former 4.0 of earlier years' V8s.  I put the XK-R wheels on it with all-season Michelins, and these work much better in winter than the 19s with Pirrelli summer/snows -- we have a lot of rough roads in Michigan.  KNOW your mechanic, even if just warranty stuff.  Not all dealers have ""Jaguar certified"" ones do work (some go out on own)."
jaguar,xk-series,2003,Mr Dearborn, 12/04/2007,Know what it is.,4,"The XKR is a touring car, not a race car.  People often get caught up in statistics when evaluating cars in this category.  The XKR is heavier than other sports cars so it is slower in 0-60 times and around a track.  You do get something though from the weight - leather and wood everywhere.  Sitting in an XKR is a thrill in itself let alone driving it.  And it is plenty fast with 400bhp.  There are some quirks and design flaws on the XKR that you wouldn't find on a German car but the XKR seethes passion unlike its rivals.  It is gorgeous to look at and a very rare car, the coupe especially; people will stare.  In short, when I feel like getting out of town for a weekend, this car is perfect."

quality CD based NAV and the 'cheap""

decision easy. Both cars are quiet, 
smooth and really great vehicles.

We bought the XKR and we're loving 
every minute of it.  We made the right 
decision.  Its a reallllly fun car to

Looks-wise, as far as I'm concerned this is the most beautiful car on the road! Anywhere! Ever! Period! The perfect update in body lines but still reminiscent of the legendary XKE. I can't stop looking at it! You know, anyone can buy a Camaro, Mustang or 'Vette, and they're nice cars and all, but they're a dime a dozen. With the XK, and especially the rare-ness of the ""R"", now you have class. People constantly stop to gawk and often ask me what it is. And it gives you a special feeling when you can reply, not ""Chevy"" or ""Ford""...but ""Jaguar""! The best was when I came out of a restaurant last month to find 6 elderly women ogling over it! Performance wise it's great, it is fast! Fastest on the road? No, not by a long shot, but faster than 95+% of them. There's nothing like leaving the light and being to 60 mph effortlessly (I'm talking only part throttle), looking back and seeing everyone still just getting rolling. And I always have to turn the stereo down when I do because the best music is the sound of that Eaton supercharger whine! Put the transmission in ""Sport"" mode and it snaps through the gears and if you nail it from a stop (before it shifts to 2nd, something it likes to do in short order) and it launches HARD! This car has a nearly perfect combination of looks and performance, it really is as quick as it looks. For a sports car it really rides quite nice considering its handling is so crisp. Another big plus is the gas mileage, I can easily get 28 mpg at 65 mph and that's GPS corrected for mileage over a 620 mile trip. How do you beat a car that looks like this, handles like this, looks like this, rides like this, looks like this and goes like this with nearly 400 supercharged V8 horsepower and gets this kind of mileage? Did I also mention what a looker it is too? The interior is beautiful too with the polished burled walnut and leather even though there's no place to really store anything. My biggest ""gripe"" is probably getting in, or especially, out of it. Tough, I can live with it. A useless ""3 marble"" tray in the console has a small tray and a 4 coin slot, pretty much a joke. I removed it and made a nice polished aluminum plate in which I installed a combination volt meter (because there isn't one), cig lighter socket (that's always powered now) and dual USB port as the only power outlet on the car is the cigarette lighter inside the ashtray which is only hot when the ignition is on. In this day & age you can't have too many charging ports for all your ""stuff"". I also removed the ridiculous nav system from the dash (it's user un-friendly, no touch screen controls, runs off a DVD player in the trunk (!) and the last update was before the car was even built. My 35 year old street wasn't even on it!) and I installed a nice Garmin in its place - and it looks factory. Same for the stereo. The old 2004 stereo has a 6 disc player in the trunk, no aux inputs and a cassette deck. Yeah, a cassette deck! Its did crank pretty well but I put a modern Pioneer in its place, replaced the amp in the trunk (kept the Alpine speakers, they're okay) and now I have a modern stereo that rattles the mirrors and interfaces with my phone. These few simple, cheap updates were all this car needed. Maintenance so far has been good, it's been easier to work on (so far) than I'd expected and so far parts (like brakes, etc.) haven't been out of line either. It really makes all the difference if you can take on repairs like this yourself, normal maintenance on these isn't too far out of reach of the average Joe and you'll save yourself a bundle. This car is a keeper. Did I mention how beautiful it is?

It's been over a year, they asked if I wanted to update so I will. I've put about 17K
 on it now and it's STILL my all time favorite car! But I'll say this, anyone buying these new paid almost $90,000 and they were never a 90,000 dollar car! 60 maybe but not 90. My biggest gripe is the stupid little things that shouldn't be an issue on a car like this. The driver's seat squeaks and squawks when you're trying to get out so I'm going to have to fix that, everything is motorized and the power function for the head restraint (do you REALLY need a power head restraint?) just grinds and growls. Same for the motorized steering column. Every time you get out the wheel moves to the top (or else you'll never get out!) and when you get in you have to move it back down (actually it's supposed to do it automatically). I have to hit the down switch anywhere from 3 to 10 times to get the wheel back down. It's not a big repair but it's something else I have to fix. There is a little rattle in the dash I have to fix. Why should a $90,000 car have a rattly dash at under 60,000 miles? My 160,000 mile/13 winter Chevy truck has never had issues like these at all, what's that say?

However mine has been flawless, everything works, i haven't done a thing to except change the oil.  I put approx 5k on it, Sure it complains under hard acceleration but it surges forward with authority every time I punch the throttle. I wanted something other than a Camaro  or Mustang (which I have 2014) I'm in love with lines and breath taking beauty like everyone else. --It's nowhere near worth 80k new or otherwise. However it's does everything I ask and more, i would buy another one, as long as it's after the 2003 model year in which they changed the plastic guides on the timing chain. FYI you hear guys blaming Ford the problems ie.. reliability, workmanship, whatever, that's nonsense! FORD actually improved the thing!

08/31/17 - Still in love - the car has been almost perfect - I actually had someone leave their business card on my windshield in a parking lot recently asking me if I wanted to sell it to them!  Still enjoying everything about the car... Planning to go on several long road trips with it this fall.

jaguar,xk-series,2005,George Stepan, 01/06/2005,Whoopee!,4,"A real head turner no matter how old the exterior design may be. Some modest detractions are the ergonomics sometimes requiring you to look away from the road, could be improved, but once learned, no problem. Full leather interior with shiny wood trim spells luxury. This design too is old, but why change a good thing? Exterior metal fit is average. Not impressed with quality of the Alpine sound system given the price of this car. Performance is outstanding, a smooth 6 speed transmission, plenty of get up and go. Unless you set the speed control, you'll be going 90 and not know it. Anyone paying 70k probably does'nt care, but I get 27+ mpg on the road. A great touring car!  "

are in it. Strangers talk to me at red 
lights and in parking lots, and I know 
its not because of my red hair on my 50 
year old body. Its all about the car. I 
am the princess I never got to be when 
I was a girl, I am the Homecoming

jaguar,xk-series,2005,Jag Lover, 06/02/2016,Superb GT Car,5,"This 2005 XKR coupe is the third Jag I have owned. Previous cars included a 1969 E-Type 2+2 and a 2004 XK8 coupe. While this car is now 11 years old, it is drop dead gorgeous, and I still find myself sneaking out to the garage occasionally at night just to admire it. The DNA from the E-Type is much more obvious for this first series of XK8s and XKRs than the 2nd generation XK8s and XKRs, and just like the E-Type, these cars will always look beautiful no matter how old they become. And while they look great in photos, they have a very striking physical presence when seen in the flesh that rivals any exotic from Italy or Germany. I never feel as though I am playing second fiddle when driving this car. If the E-Type is a WWII Spitfire, the XKR is a Lear jet on steroids. It is a superb, outrageously beautiful, classy, and fast GT car with an original 2005 sticker price of just shy of $100,000 that can now be purchased for around a quarter of that price. Eventually, the ones with low miles and in great condition are going to begin to appreciate significantly in value. The perfect combination of speed, grace and sensuous good looks. A thing of beauty is a joy forever.

More power, more torque, 1 more gear, better handling, better looking exterior. I really look forward to driving every day. This car has the power available when you want it.

driving the coupe it feels like you¬íre 
the only one on the planet that has one 
and everyone wants to know, ¬ìhow much 
was that¬î, or ¬ìwhere did you get it¬î.

jaguar,xk-series,2005,JANE, 07/17/2004,LOVE THIS CAR,4,"THIS IS MY FAVORITE CAR SO FAR, THAT I 
HAVE HAD. IT'S A PERFECT SIZE. YOU 
DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU ARE DRIVING A 
LITTLE CONVERTIBLE WHEN YOU ARE IN IT.
I DON'T THINK IT'S A RACING CAR IF 
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR. BUT, 
IT'S ALOT OF FUN TO DRIVE AROUND.THE 
BODY STYLE MAKES IT SO EASY TO KEEP 
CLEAN TOO.IT'S ALSO GOT A GREAT SOUND 
SYSTEM.I INTENTED TO KEEP MINE FOREVER."
jaguar,xk-series,2005,Mike925925, 07/17/2004,Excellent car to pwn!,4,"Clean finish.  Nice quality interior 
detail.  Smooth quick acceleration.  
Looks like it costs twice as much.  A 
true winner!"
jaguar,xk-series,2005,1 of 250, 07/27/2004,Keep your Mercedes and Porsches,5,"Just stay clear of any potholes!  
During a rain storm I hit a rain filled 
one and caused $1200.00 in front-end 
damage to the front passenger wheel 
assembly.  20"" low profile wheels are 
great looking but extreme attention 
must be given to the roadways."
jaguar,xk-series,2005,Ron Katz, 08/15/2004,A beautiful car,5,"This is my second XKR.  Before that I
owned XK8's.  This is the best one yet.
 An absolutely beautiful car and ""tight""
 No squeeks over bumps - super solid. 
Everything about the car says ""power""and
it's so. The only additional feature I
would wish for is an automatic tire
pressure regulator.  One last
thought..the door handles are chrome -
it would be nice if they were rubber
coated.  Here in Arizona after sitting
in the sun they get hot, hot, hot."
jaguar,xk-series,2005,charlie718, 08/16/2004,This car is the car to have,5,"I just traded in a DRM 400 corvette to 
get the Jag going from a lifelong super 
car owner with a manuel trans into a 
six speed auto gave me some pause well 
the jag auto in combo with the 
supercharger leaves no doubt in my mind 
this is the way to go the car gets 
looks from every body and when you step 
on the gas it just takes off like a 
space shuttle it stays glued onto the 
road and feels like driving a rolex 
that goes 180 mph it is so solid quiet 
and smooth I love this car and will now 
always have one I will just trade it in 
every few years"
jaguar,xk-series,2005,RdKing, 09/25/2004,"Wow, it's all Jag",5,"When trying to discribe my experience 
with the jag the word Wow comes to 
mind. I'd say it's the most bang for 
the buck, even though it takes many 
bucks.  I have four of the older 
models, two XK roadsters, and it's 
preformance is light-years away ahead 
of the older jags.  It's a car I love 
to drive.  I do have to learn how to 
handle the speed....it's fast.  "

jaguar,xk-series,2005,Toni Elkins, 01/15/2005,Finally!,4,After years of wanting this car--I got it! A gift from my husband---and it was worth waiting for! Excellent!
jaguar,xk-series,2006,Charles Roller, 09/25/2005,Best Sports Car I've Owned,4,"This Jaguar Racing Green XKR is absolutely the finest and most enjoyable automobile I've ever owned.  The exterior styling is gorgeous, the interior stately and rich, and the power truly breath-taking.  I cannot imagine any impovement that makes sense for this vehicle.  Even the achieved city gas mileage figure is 16.9 mpg - quite a happy surprise.  I haven't taken the XKR on an extended highway trip yet, but fully expect to see 25+ mpg.  Other than the high cost of entry, and reasonable but steep insurance premiums, this is an exceptional automobile that makes me smile every time I open the driver's door."
jaguar,xk-series,2006,Dale, 03/05/2018,Best Used Luxury Convertible for the Money,5,"I've had a few sports cars, and bought a used XK8 with 55K miles just for fun weekend drives.   This particular engine (4.2 L V-8 in the 2003 and later XK8s) has turned out to be a reliable and strong and if buying used, you get a lot of bang for the buck.  Mine averages over  27 mpg on trips.  Cruising at 70 feels like 50, and it's hard not to go faster.  The aerodynamics allow a conversation in the cabin at freeway speeds.  When the top is up, the inner liner keeps road noise down, and it feels like a coupe.  The stereo even sounds great.  I don't drive fast, so I can't really comment on handling.  I've had quite a few different fun cars, but for the money this is the best driving experience and quality I've found, and I will probably keep this car around for a long time.  This car's a real beauty!
UPDATE:  A friend of mine who owns a Fuel Distribution company suggested I try Premium-ethanol-free gas.  The results were amazing.  I drove to Seattle and Back (400 miles)  MPG was 29.1.  This is on a 300 horse V8 from 2006.  Have driven this vehicle about 4,000 miles over the past year and it's great fun!
Another Update:  I still love this car.  I let my 87 y/o dad drive it because the last Jaguar he drove was his 1953 XK120 (which he still has).  He couldn't believe how well it handled.   I'm considering getting a later model XK to add to the collection because I'm hooked on these things.
"
jaguar,xk-series,2006,Fred, 10/24/2007,Superb Car,4,Recently traded my XJR for an XKR. This car is so much superior and draws far more attention. The styling is timeless and the performance excellent for a touring car of this type. Not as much raw fun as my old TVR but still the best car I've ever owned.
jaguar,xk-series,2006,Robert Mattingly, 02/14/2006,"So Far, So Great!",4,"I purchased the XKR for three reasons: the engine, styling; and, because I think its a better looking car then the soon-to-be-introduced XK. Plus, the price is about as right as its going to get as dealers clear them out. The XKR is not really a ""sports car"" but rather a ""sporty"" car. It doesn't handle in the same league with my old Porsche 911 but it rides much better-perhaps the best riding car I've ever owned. I deleted the expensive 20 inch chrome plated wheel/tire combo, and replaced with the standard 18 inch tires and wheels,saved $5000 and got a better ride. The interior is beautiful if not particularly roomy. Overall, a great package of power, luxury and character. "
jaguar,xk-series,2006,Lana DeSimone, 08/26/2005,Get What You Pay For!,5,"Solid, Hearty and luxurious! I love this Jaguar. Convertible gives plenty of space, loads of leg room  with plenty of trunk space and POWER behind the wheel!"
jaguar,xk-series,2006,Jim, 04/24/2018,A lot of Jag for the money,5,"Owners always say ""I could drive this car forever"".  Few other 12 year old cars elicit as many compliments and admiring looks.  And, of course, it's a Jag.

jaguar,xk-series,2006,inheritablessing, 07/20/2005,A dream car,4,Love everything about it!!! There is nothing like the vintage looks of Jaguar.  It's smooth as butter. Haven't yet been called to have serviced. Absolutely a dream car.
jaguar,xk-series,2006,Dan Geib, 08/02/2005,XKR The Only Way to go!,4,I purchased this vehicle used from a private individual with low miles. I have enjoyed driving the car every time I get behind the wheel. This car is fast and tight and holds the road at any speed!
jaguar,xk-series,2006,Ray Malooly, 04/16/2005,Malooly review,4,"The only complaint is the front bumper is too low to the ground, you have to be careful not to hit parking guards. Lots of fun to drive.  Sure attracts attention from everyone.  Lots of power, and looks."
jaguar,xk-series,2006,DOBOSJ, 04/30/2005,FUN CAT,4,"Very quiet, fast and smooth as a cat feel and performance."
jaguar,xk-series,2006,john webb, 06/10/2005,Love my Jag,4,I looked at other mfgs like Benz and BMW.  They just started looking alike.  The Interior of the jag makes a statement and the body style stands out.  Very large trunk space major plus over others and the backseat is very useful.  It makes it easy to store items quickly.  Back seat is a quick place to put items.  The backseat was one of the feature that sold me.  
jaguar,xk-series,2006,Jeramy, 07/26/2005,Amazing!!!,5,"It's a great car to drive, nice easy- going stability, acceleration is very fast. It's a semi-auto car. You can choose the power from 2 to 5 or for automatic put it in D or Drive. It says that it'll go top speed: 170. The thing that I didn't like was it doesen't have automatic and manual it's only semi-auto it's not where you can put it in M and shift like in a Ferrari."
jaguar,xk-series,2006,Bob K, 08/26/2005,THE Car to Buy,4,"2 months into this 06 XKR. Love the car. 3rd XK in 5 yrs. XKR is far superior to XK8. For Style and Performance, it is without peer. I park next to an SL600 every day and people stare at the XKR."
jaguar,xk-series,2006,blairm, 04/21/2006,Jaguar XKR,4,"AS my third XK I was delighted to see this car the new ""carbon"" interior is a pleasant change from the traditional wood. My only regret is that the capability of the vehicle with its massive supercharger is reduced by the silly electronic limiters."
jaguar,xk-series,2007,K Taylor, 11/02/2015,Great Car!! Miss it and think about it often.,5,"The base engine is a little light on power compared to other cars in this segment.  If you are looking for super performance look at the XKR.  I am more of a Grand Tourer driver than an all out performance driver.  I think it has something to do with my age now.  The base model had plenty of power for me and from 40mph to 120mph there was never a situation where I needed any more.  In fact I was, ticketed while test driving on a desolate NV highway. I was going 100+ and the cop was nice enough to write the ticket for only 10 over.

I have owned numerous high end and luxury cars over the years but none compares to the reactions this car received, especially when the top was down.  BMW 6 series and MB SL are very common but you don't see many XKs which was something I enjoyed about the car.  I bought the car used with 25,000 miles on it when it was 5 yrs old.  The technology was on par and up to date with the newest cars of that time.  Bluetooth and touchscreen navigation, adaptive cruise control and headlamps as examples.  

I purchased an extended warranty since the car was 5 years old and there was only one issue with a window that was moving slowly.  I did have to replace the battery which when it was going bad messed with the drivers seat controls and the convertible top which may stop working even if the car has no troubles starting.  The battery was expensive as were oil changes.  I replaced the original tires with Michelin Super Sport that had plenty of tread after 3 years.

Fantastic Car that gets tons of compliments, is quiet and very comfortable.  The car handles great and has a great exhaust note which makes it fun to drive.  It is pretty much maintenance and repair free although it is thirsty when it comes to fuel around town.  16-18 mpg city, 26-28 mpg highway
"
jaguar,xk-series,2007,D Akers, 11/21/2006,Better and Better,4,"I have owed a 1999, 2002 and now 2007 Jag XKs and this is a runaway hit!  The aluminum body is much more rigid, the paddle shifters add a new dimension and the blue tooth technology and keyless entry are a big plus.  Styling is better and the operation of the top is much better and the boot cover is automatic.  Only down side is the greatly decreased truck space and no manual transmission (as per the past).  Before I decided on this vehicle I drove the Mercedes CLK and the BMW 6 series and this beats them hands down!  One caution, don't test drive one... you will buy it."
jaguar,xk-series,2007,onebeatatatime, 08/04/2010,Wouldn't believe it if I didn't drive it,5,"Not too long ago J D Powers gave Jaguar a glorious review especially for reliability.  Eye opener.  Driven several BMWs and 2 Mercedes SLs (500, 600) in the past.   The new XK blew me away. Jaguar has carved design and performance.  Power is less than 911 but plentiful.  Drives like a sports touring.  Purrs when slow but ready to leap with a growl with the push of the accelerator, wheels always hugging cement, driver held tight in the seat.  Navigation / phone / Audio in the center with intuitive touch screen controls simply ingenious, yet enormously functional.  bluetooth pairing with Blackberry seamlessly.  Jaw dropping looks. Most people don't  know what just rushed passed them."
jaguar,xk-series,2007,jagluver, 12/12/2006,jagluver,4,"I bought this car when it first arrived in the US.  I have had more than 10 service visits in 3 months.  The gas door would not open and had to be modified.  The check engine light has come on 4 times with no real reason. The power seat failed, the windows do not move down a little everytime when you open the door and then up to seal when the door is closed, therefore, door will not shut normally.  The radio antenna causes a wind noise at high speeds.  There was a funny noise like a creak in the brakes when the car tilted and came to a stop.  Overall, I love the looks of the car but am frustrated with the little problems that keep recurring."
jaguar,xk-series,2007,Italian Forza, 12/06/2006,Wasn't even looking for a Jaguar,5,"I stumbled across this car while shopping for a Range Rover for my wife.  I bought it on the spot.  Strikingly beautiful. This car has such a gorgeous design that I just stare at it outside my office window until I give in to the call of the wild and take it out for a spin.  I just came off a 4 year relationship with a Maserati Coupe. This XK provides ""most"" of the performance of the Maserati with the added level of luxury and comfort. Maybe I'm getting old, but when I want to be ""sporty"" I start to bang off shifts with the paddles.  When I want to take it easy, full automatic does the trick.  This is my first Jaguar and I am absolutely in love.  I just hope it is reliable.Wish me luck"
jaguar,xk-series,2007,X150 Lover, 12/16/2007,"XK Coupe at 55,000 miles",4,"A good looking, smooth running, GT car which can dice with the best out there on the back roads. It's quiet when you're cruising, but barks when you thrash it. The normally aspirated engine is adequate for public roads, and with the DSC off, all the power can be safely used for an exhilerating drive, the car cornering flatly and being able to balance under steer and over steer with the throttle. The fuel economy is very good, and the maintenance costs are low. So far, reliability is excellent."
jaguar,xk-series,2007,David Akers, 09/23/2006,2007 Jaguar XK,4,"This is the third XK I have owned.  If you have not driven a Jag you have not driven.  The XK is hands down the best car I have ever driven.  The styling and comfort of the new all aluminum Jag is show stopping.  It is stiffer and more substantial than the previous XKs I have owned.  If you want a true sports car, I believe this will be the car to own."

I drive it like I stole it. Paint still awsome. Runs like the cat it is. Replaced front bushings, guck bill a/c prob, couple lil things and at 65k miles. I love it more every second. 10th of a second faster than the XKR with a hundred more ponies to 60mph. Interior more classy IMO. I think this is the best jag ever made. No intention of selling it.

I also had the vehicle coated so that waxing never has to be performed. The car performs very well @ 300 hp but I like the gas mileage it can achieve. I have recorded 31 mpg. With fuel costs rising and the desire to own a fantastic looking performance vehicle, is there any other way to go?"
jaguar,xk-series,2007,Timio-san, 09/05/2007,"Top Quality, Tons-o-Fun!",4,"A proud owner since May 2006. I ordered the XK the very 1st day it was availabe for ordering in the US - got the 3rd convert delivered in the Wash DC area. I traded a 2003 Merc SL500 and couldn't have made a better choice. The XK is drop dead sexy and has stellar interior and exterior styling. Jag's Ian Callum is a genius on this one! The quality and reliability has been better than any Porsche, BMW or Merc I've owned. In other words, zero defects, only two trips to the dealer for minor tweaks. The performance is especially pleasing in Sport mode - plenty fast for DC driving. I've taken four trips of 2+ hours and this thing is comfortable and joy on the highway."
jaguar,xk-series,2007,domesticdude, 03/25/2008,2007 XKR Coupe,4,"I LOVE this car, it's beautiful inside and out, fast, and handles great. I have never had a problem of any kind with this car. The XKR is fast, not the fastest, but still plenty fast and yet still manages to ride extremely well. I have never driven a car with better handling, or that is more fun to drive. The only flaw with the car that i can find is that mine has one of the ridiculous antennas, but they thankfully got rid of that for 2008. "
jaguar,xk-series,2007,Dr.Roentgen, 01/03/2007,Not Quite Perfect,4,"This is the most beautiful and fun car I have ever had. It's like a corvette but for grown ups. There have been several annoying problems that you wouldn't expect at this pricepoint. The bluetooth system doesn't work as promised. I have changed cellphones (three times)  and carriers (from verizon to cingular) per Jaguar's advice, but the phone still doesn't sync as promised. There are other small computer probs as well. I still love the car. "
jaguar,xk-series,2007,firstjag, 01/07/2007,firstjaginfatuation,5,"Picked up my '07 XK Coupe 2 weeks ago - a black with tan model with several upgrades. Replaced Mercedes CLS 500. The looks, the ride, the handling, the sound, seats, paddle shifters, styling, performance and the right technology with push button start and blue tooth all sold me. Plenty of power and best shifting trans experienced - best paddle shifters on the market. Very respectable gas mileage and no guzzler tax. Could do without the old world antenna. Overall a great package of styling, performance and sizzle. Interior is well done with great seats and clean yet very functional dash design."
jaguar,xk-series,2007,Ed, 10/29/2007,Super Jag,5,"Mileage on a long trip.   Fantastic. Exceeded 29 mpg at high speed. Yes over 80 mph for most of trip.  In town low speed exceeded 19.5 mpg.  Much better than ratings.  At end of 16 hours on road, still comfortable!!  Boot small, but that comes with territory.  Back seat used to hold a small brief or camera bag.  Touch screen much easier than BMW 750i I had previously.  Nav system much more user friendly.  Love it!"
jaguar,xk-series,2007,Corky B, 11/15/2019,A sporty highway car to love like no other!,5,"I bought mine 12 years old - and it still is a thrilling blast to drive.  I got it cheap as the suspension bushings were mostly shot, the tires were bad, and there was a problem with the radio cutting out.  (After 2 days of driving with radio cuts, it re-booted itself and has been fine ever since.)  With $1,300 in new suspension installed by my favorite local mechanic - who loves the car - and new Falken 20 inch tires, the car is a quiet, sophisticated, launch machine for high speed.  

I had to test it once re-fitted, and got to 140 mph before I said ""enough"" - rock solid at that speed is saying something for a 2007 convertible w 80k miles.  I have had Miatas, Solstice GXPs, Audis, Beemer 3 series, but this car has a special combination of British refinement and brutal V8 power when you work the great transmission correctly.  It is not generic nor boring ""everywhere"" lux sportcar. Its not the most powerful V8 in the class, but the experience is plenty fast and 100% fun. And I get 30 mpg on the highway if baby it, and 19 around town if not gunning it.  No major problems and reliable in the first 4 months.  The top can be tricky as the battery and program can cause it to act weird - freeze half open, go dead, etc.  Once you figure out the system, it is predictable.  LOVE THIS CAR!!

jaguar,xk-series,2007,CJ, 09/10/2006,Awesome XK replacement,4,"Replaced 98 XK8 with this vehicle. Objectively considered several other vehicles, but after hitting other marques and testing-driving, ultimately decided to give the 07 XK a try when all things considered for me (styling, performance, features).  I marked Reliability as ""10"" cause (knock on burled walnut), no problems yet, but just had it a couple days."
jaguar,xk-series,2007,KLefty, 12/30/2008,Still Runs Like a Dream,5,"In my third year of driving the restyled XK.  I am amazed that I have yet to have ANY even minor issue with this car.  I hesitated to buy a Jaguar because of the old reputation as unreliable.  The performance and styling wowed me and I just had to have one.  Bravo, Jaguar on the maintenance reliability!"
jaguar,xk-series,2007,Dave, 10/29/2007,One word for the XKR Conv - AWESOME !,5,"Was considering ragtops like the BMW M6, MB 500, etc., until I stumbled upon a review for the XKR. Jaguar.  If someone told me I'd be buying a $100K car from Jag, I would have told them to lay off the ""sauce"".  But after reading numerous positive reviews on this vehicle, I took the plunge and bought a 2007 XKR on eBay with 4500 miles in mint condition.  This is one awesome car, in every sense - From its stunning looks (it gets parked in front automatically at just about every place I valet) to its remarkably comfortable and intuitive interior, to its great gas mileage for such a powerful car, and of course, the exceptional handling around town and on the track, this car is a winner."

jaguar,xk-series,2007,Frank, 02/27/2009,Great GT - Pooooooor Electrical,3,Love the car - Drives great - great head turned.  Power is good but could be better.  But the most annoying thing about it is the electrical problems - especially the display screen that is totally inoperable at times.  The dealer has been no help and Jaguar Engineering who inspected the car is no help either.  Awaiting decision on a buy back.  Probably would not purchase another.
jaguar,xk-series,2007,Black Diamond, 04/28/2008,"""My Last Fling""",4,"This car is so exciting to drive and to look at that I call it ""my last fling"".  When I'm behind the wheel, I feel like I never need to own another car, ever. Driving it is like cruising down a ski slope on fresh powder.  You glide along until you decide to exploit its power with a burst of acceleration.  The sexy growl of the engine when you push the start button and the power of the engine  when you shift it into gear and accelerate let you know that this is no kid's toy.  This car is for the enthusiast who can't wait to find a stretch of open road."
jaguar,xk-series,2007,D Ingram, 09/14/2016,2007 USED XKR COUPE NIGHTMARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,2,"I purchased by 2007 XKR Coupe with 77,000 miles in good condition Nov 2015. within the first month needed $500 in maintenance for supercharger pulleys and belts because they started to rattle... fine. Then in February after hitting multiple a potholes, the front suspension was leaking, busted both front tires and bent both rims. On a high performance coupe why did the put 20 inch low profile tires to only be fitted on this car? Suspension, bearings, 1 new rim 1 fixed rim, and 2 new tires, road force balancing, and alignment; TOTAL $6000 TO COMPLETE THE FRONT END AT A AUTHORIZED JAGUAR DEALER AND THE STEERING STILL WAS CRAP AND MAKING NOISES. I have taken the car back over 10 times to the dealer to try to find the problem as they continue to try new things. Their mechanics are obviously just as crap.it has been 8 months taking the car back and forth because the steering and drive has been horrible ever since. Th next issue was at 83000 THE ENGINE BLEW LEAVING ME ON THE SIDE OF A HIGHWAY AND THEY HAVE NO EXPLANATION. OIL WAS CHANGED 6000 MILES AGO AND THEY ADVISED I WOULD ONLY NEED A OIL CHANGE EVERY 8000-10000 MILES.... TOTAL CRAP!!!!TOTAL PRICE OF A REPLACED ENGINE WAS $7000. The water reservoir also started to leak $450, the headliner on a 2007 car already has fallen $600. Front grill that is only snapped in pops out all the time and finally it came off on the highway $200.  Rear axle snapped clean in half $400. Speaker system is crap, and the tweeter grilles have popped out. Bluetooth only recognizes certain frequencies and not all so my phone is not compatible, and when it can work its for calls only no audio or media sharing. As of today ALL 4 RIMS ARE BENT THEY ARE CRAP! Rear glass cover always falls down and then finally the clamps cracked and broke off. the heated seats stopped working. the seat adjustment makes you feel like your in a convertible because they don't go back far enough and I'm only 5""10. On the good side the car looks absolutely stunning in profile it always has people stop and look. The drive and power and sound are exotic at its best. The sound can be heard a block away and is beautiful. But jaguar dealers are horrible in luxury standards in service and repairs are over the top for poor quality. This is a ford product with bells. the newer Jags owned by Tata will definitely be a better buy. I love what this car does... but i hate its quality and reliabilty. I would never recommend purchasing this model. save the headache and buy a CL Mercedes or the new Jaguar FType that's all new built if you have the $$$

jaguar,xk-series,2007,ed bowers, 01/14/2008,not a premium car,4,"bad electrical systems. Dash panel goes out. Exterior temp goes out. Lights inoperable. Rear end rattles. Squeaky brakes. Place a 4 lb item on passenger seat, seat belt allarm goes off."
jaguar,xk-series,2007,socalh2oskier, 05/17/2006,Gorgeous car - seats not comfortable,4," Sexy ext., and interior is best ever on a car - perfect combination of wood and leather.  Super handling and ride - although car is rather large - 188 in. long and 75 in. wide - it drives smaller - turn radius shorter than BMW 3-series.  Wind buffeting virtually non-existent.  Excellent stereo and super quiet ride with top up.  Seats are better than prior years, but still uncomfortable - headrest is rock hard, lumbar too high - Corvette, BMW, and Porsche all have better seats.  Complicated integration of radio, A/C etc thru NAV screen - cannot see it with sunglasses - and too many screen required to make changes.  Should have HUD like Corvette so eyes can stay on road."
jaguar,xk-series,2007,Claudia, 06/30/2008,The most fun you can get in a car,5,"I absolutely love my XK convertible!  I truly underestimated the fun factor of having a convertible that the top goes up or down in 18 seconds... so fast you can put it down at a light.  In Alabama where I live, I get 10 mos of top down weather.  It is also a head turner... looking like nothing else on the street (except now it's new sister the XF sedan).  It is great for a road trip... it's very adjustable seating lends itself to comfortable driving.  I've leased this vehicle, but will most likely buy it at the end of the term.  Drive it, you'll fall in love!"
jaguar,xk-series,2007,ace, 06/03/2006,Best Jag Ever!,5,"Recently sold '98 XK8 to acquire the 2007 New XK. Looks good, drives like a dream, great gas milage for such a car. The fit and finish on this car is flawless. With Luxury package, Premium Sound and Technolgy Package there isn't much left. The advanced features are just so perfect for this car - keyless entry, auto everything, touch screen controls that are intuitive. If you are in the market for a sophisticated sports car vehicle this is definately one you will fall head over heels in love with."
jaguar,xk-series,2007,Goins, 10/30/2006,Great Cat,5,This is my third XK and by far the best. It is a class act and nothing on the road distracts you from the looks.
jaguar,xk-series,2007,J Egan, 01/28/2007,My Blue Jag,5,"I have yet to take my XK out of my garage without someone making a highly favorable compliment about it. It turns heads. The car is very comfortable and fun to drive. Equipped with the 20"" Senta wheels I believe makes the XK comparable to riding on a cloud without losing the driving experience.  The front end is longer and the road clearance is lower as with most performance cars so one needs to be careful not to scrape the bottom of the front end in driveways as well as judging front parking distance. The rear parking is a cinch with the radar assistance.  Based upon performance, appearance, and personal satisfaction, this XK is the best and finest car I'v ever owned or driven.     "
jaguar,xk-series,2007,Charles Murphy, 02/07/2019,XK Head Turner,5,"The 2007 XK Convertible in Emerald Fire Green with tan interior with beryl wood tones turns heads wherever I go.  It has many standard features that are ahead of many cars of its day and beyond such as touch screen display, individual electronic temperature/climate controls, electronic heat for seats, intuitive navigation system, AM/FM radio with Blue Tooth, backup obstacle sensors,  front and back car avoidance automatic features, and individual electronic seat adjustments .  The engine (V8)and transmission (automatic or paddle shifters) are synced well and smoothly changes gears as required.  The gas required is 91 Octane which requires premium fuel normally around 93 Octane.  The gas mileage in town is around 18-20 MPG and 23 MPG on the road.  Love driving this car in town as well as on the road (Houston to Dallas and back).  The maintenance costs for normal wear and tear is somewhat high given the average 60,000 mile check up is around  $1,500.  I have owned this car since December 2016 and it had 52,250 miles on it.  It now has 62,300 miles on it.  In that two year period, I experience a cracked thermostat housing (replaced) causing a repeating Check Engine light, and Fuel Dampener failure (replaced) (fuel smell in the cockpit) as the only major maintenance issues.  Both of these issues are known problems with the XK.  Also, virtually no back seat that an adult could ride in.  Love this car.

As an update to this review, I have owned this Jaguar for approximately three years and I still standby my previous comments.  The only issue to affect my XK sense my last review is a Warning Display that my right rear tire is not monitored.  I check my tires and they have required pressure.  I will need to have my car servicing center reset the sensor on the right rear tire to eliminate the warning display.  Still love this car.

jaguar,xk-series,2007,keoni, 01/31/2020,excuse me while I kiss the sky,5,"found my 2007 jaguar zk convertible online.  was searching for the perfect car for me and had settled on the jaguar convertible. wanted something eye catching and not small.
found her. a white convertible with leather interior in the linen color, a blue top and less than 25000 mines on her when I took possession
went to pick her up and was delighted in the appearance and the size. when I begin to drive her back to my home state, that is when the thrill began.
smooth ride, great pick up, all the things one would want in a touring sports car. tight, agile steering, a solid feel of the road and a feeling that you were a part of the road with no intention of being ""blown"" off.
people stop and stare as well as compliments everytime I take her out for a spin.
and with the convertible top down, she really shows how good a car she is.
drove the mountain roads in North Carolina with a delight and giggle, maneuvering through all the curves and switchbacks.
I am so pleased with my car it becomes difficult not to make up excuses just to drive her around the block.
I would definitely recommend this jaguar to anyone looking for fun and excitement in their driving life."
jaguar,xk-series,2007,Last Jag, 07/04/2007,First and Last Jaguar,2,"The car is beautiful on the exterior, the interior is not very functional with misplaced buttons all around. Reliability is horrible, I think I spend more time in my rental car than my Jaguar. My son's popsicle stick birdhouse is built better than this car. I have decided I am ending the lease early and buying a BMW 6-Series."
jaguar,xk-series,2007,Ron, 02/27/2017,What a disappointment,4,"I bought my dream Jag 2 months ago, only to discover, the dreaded electric gremlins attacked, over $2k for fuel pump and fuel pcm to be replaced, thermostat and housing over $400, over $1300 for tires, after all that that fuel system acts up yet again, would not start after a long drives, traded it for a 2013 BMW 328i. In the future maybe the BMW on. 2010-2014.

jaguar,xk-series,2007,D. Stumpf, 12/08/2006,"A ""Gorgeous"" Value",5,"I have had my eye on the re-designed XK for some time and finally had the opportunity to aquire one this fall.  Almost everything about the car is exceptional, foremost the styling.  Call it what you will, a ""poor man's Aston"" perhaps, but it is one of the most beautiful automobiles on the road. Handling and performance are great (a bit underpowered perhaps - although given the aluminium monocoque construction the power/weight is commendable), interior design is outstanding (pitch the back seat!), overall fit and finish are excellent.  Time will tell regarding reliability, but Jaguar has risen steadily in overall quality and reliabily in recent years.  A real head-turner to say the least."
jaguar,xk-series,2007,ascorvettemike, 08/04/2006,Big Mistake,2,"Great looking exterior, but too bad the rest of the car does not measure up.  The transmission and stereo are phenomenal.  The back seat is useless, and the driving experience is ho-hum.  This is a nice car, but at this price-point, I expect much more.  The seats are average, the ride is simply okay - not exhilarating.  The car handles okay, but is a tad rough, which is surprising given its size.  The size is one of the main problems - this car is simply too big for a 2 seater.  "
jaguar,xk-series,2007,radical, 06/03/2006,The Jaguar Has Arrived!,5,Jaguar has done it! The attention to detail is amazing; even the turn signal sounds like a grandfather clock ticking. I have never enjoyed driving a vehicle as much as this one.
jaguar,xk-series,2007,peter, 06/19/2006,Best of the best,5,I have owned 5 bmw 1 mercedes 2 porsche 2 corvette 3 cadillac  1 audi and this is far superior to all. No problems and great to drive. All options are great and the interface is very easy to use. The rear seat and truck are also roomier than most other sports cars especially the convertible hard top ones.
jaguar,xk-series,2007,ndb, 06/19/2006,Could Not Be More Pleased!,5,"Recently acquired to replace my 98XK8 that served me well. This car is so much more in many ways -  performance is outstanding, looks are just the best, ride excellent, seating very comfortable.

jaguar,xk-series,2007,MrJaguar, 07/01/2006,Magnificent Jag,5,"Most stunning, attention-getting car on the road.  Clean, sleek and simple exteior.  Looks and drives fast.  All around handling is incredible.  Really holds the road on turns, great suspension, silky smooth transmission and awesome brakes.  Comfortable, luxurious interior,  great quality throughout and easy- to-use, uncluttered instrument panel.  Makes some of its competitors look like little old lady cars.  In fact, a friend who recently saw my Jag (an indigo blue coupe) was almost ashamed to admit he owned the BMW 650i."
jaguar,xk-series,2007,john, 08/17/2006,Jaguar,5,"The car is excellent, it feels great and handles perfectly. Jag engineers have out done themselves this time. The performance is excellent and the driving position too, the seats are very comfortable and you don't feel that you are in a sports car."
jaguar,xk-series,2007,shermfa, 05/27/2006,Happy Mothers Day,4,"My husband took me to trade in my '96 Mustang GT convertible.The XK is truly an amazing piece of machinery in comparison...so quiet--even with the top down compared to the old car (she purrs not growls), and she wants to run fast.  The feature that limits acceleration may be something folks really do want to use, you can be doing 70 and feel like it's a Sunday drive at 40; top storage takes up some trunk space, though, so order Fresh Direct if it's an option.  The backseat is small, though bigger than the Mustang. The screen is almost unreadable in bright sun, but the cellphone docking features are amazing.  HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY to me!!  It's that much fun!

jaguar,xk-series,2007,Al Kelley, 05/30/2006,Fantastic jewelry to drive,4,"Have had the car for 1 month. Flawless fit, finish and materials. Really like the extra luxury option with leather covering just about everything. Upgraded stereo with satellite radio is great also. All switches and controls are high quality. It is fun to drive but comfortable to drive all day. Incredibly quiet with top up at highway speeds. With tax and extended warranty it is just over $100K but it is a bargain compared to new Bentley or Aston Martin convertibles. It totally outclasses Mercedes and BMW."
jaguar,xk-series,2007,Paul O'Mara, 06/09/2006,Stunning,4,"I've only had this car for a week, but I just don't want to get out of it. Gorgeous, gorgeous styling - a real head turner. Amazing performance (I'm used to driving 'R' Jags - but you just don't need to R in this model) and responsiveness. Really smooth acceleration - and that growl when you floor it! Wow! I love this car."
jaguar,xk-series,2007,Peppy, 06/23/2006,Rakish Roadster,5,"Incomparable, stunning exterior.   Sleek, clean and simple design that is beautiful,  yet looks utilitarian.

Very quick, ultra smooth and fast transmission,  awesome brakes, quiet, comfortable, great suspension and cornering, neat and clean instrument panel, incredibly easy to use touch screen and luxurious appointments.   Everything fits and looks right.  Exceptional quality.  A joy to drive.  Exceptional in every respect."
jaguar,xk-series,2007,meivogelmelo, 06/25/2006,Great car,5,"When putting the top down it is the best convertible when comparing the cadillac XKR, Mercedes SL 550 and BMW. There is hardly any wind inside of the car which definately can not be said to the above mentioned cars. The car has enough power and the sound of the car is great. It is a real looker and many people think it is an aston martin. The best on the current market."
jaguar,xk-series,2007,Brooklyn Lion, 08/24/2006,PURRRRFECTION!!!!,5,"Having owned previous XK8 and having at least one compliment per month from strangers, I wondered how that styling could have been improved on.  Well, Ian Callum and co. showed me how.  This car surpasses previous models in practically every category.  It is a stunning car to look at and to drive!  Styling-wise, it vaporizes every other car out there (except, perhaps, Aston Martin).  Seats are supremely comfortable.  The acceleration growl is music to the ears!  The interior is all driver-oriented, without converting the car to space-shuttle complexity and clutter.  Everyone should experience driving this car at least once! But be warned: you'll be a center of attention everywhere you go."

All that has changed.  The XK Coupe is a Jaguar again.  If you have seen it, you know what I mean.  If you drive it, you will agree.  Smooth power, stiff and agile.  Comfortable at cruising speed.  I like to use the paddle shifters and hear the exhaust note reverberate in my parking deck at work.   "

I've owned Mercedes SL, Boxster, Audi, and other luxury automobiles. This vehicle is the perfect blend of all of them. Great ride, neat exhaust notes, unbelievable sound system, and OMG - the power. Does not handle like the mid-engine Boxster, but a small inconvenience. Did I really get nearly 27 MPG on the interstate?! One thing is for sure, the Mini Cooper drivers won't be waving at me!"

Test drove 911s, m6, and maserati GT in addition to xkr.  An absolutely beautiful car inside and out.  I thought performed better (felt over engineered) and far better looking vehicle than m6, had much better luxury appointments (like gorgeous suede cabin top interior and superior nav) and much better curb appeal than 911s.   While 911s is better handling car, I found the xkr to be quicker.   While the maserati gt is an equally if not more elegant car, it didn't come close to xkr on drive performance   "
jaguar,xk-series,2008,DeanR, 08/31/2007,You're going to want one,4,"This car is incredible.  It is hands down, the sexiest, best driving, daily-driving automobile made, and it is a reasonable value.  I also own a SL500, and aside from the hardtop convertible, not one item holds up to the Jag.  Don't be fooled by the car magazine comparisons and ratings.  While the Jag holds up pretty well anyway, the tests put too much emphasis on empirical performance, and ignore what most people really care about in a car, which are good looks, and how you feel driving it.  The Jag has sufficient performance, a solid, rich feel, a growl when it needs one, and is downright beautiful.  You cannot walk away from this car without looking back for a double take."
jaguar,xk-series,2008,fred, 09/05/2009,Made a good choice,4,"My 2006 Cayman was rough, cramped and edgy. I love my new Jag; it has decent performance, good manners and is one of the most beautiful cars I have ever seen. I have discovered that it handles and drives better when being pushed. The fact that I paid about the same for the Jag as the poor man's Porsche is a bonus. The left over 2009s are a great buy if you can find one.  "

I am glad I got this over the 6 series. It has great performance and great sound! I get looks from everybody. My son loves to drive it as well.  "
jaguar,xk-series,2008,Leos A.C., 02/20/2008,Oh my GOSH!!,4,I drive many cars before I make a buying decision. Not this time. 5 minutes into my test drive I went back to the delaership and signed the paperwork. The only thing better than the drive and the beautifully updated interior is the exterior which is clearly the nicest looking car on the road.  Have only had it for a few weeks but each day gets better and better.
jaguar,xk-series,2008,Scott in PA, 08/01/2020,A Fantastic Head-Turning GT Sports Car,5,"MB SL550's are the rage, and if not for their wallet-swallowing abilities for mundane repairs I might own one. Looking for a convertible GT car, after the SL there are relatively few choices. Came across a 2008 XKR Convertible with 36k miles....price seemed fair, and home it went. I have not been able to wipe the smile off my face since. First, it's a stunner to look at. Think Aston Martin DB9 (Oh, it was designed by the same man). Second, it rockets down the highway well into triple digits with a confidence usually reserved for larger German Sedans (see review of my current Audi A8 4.0 2015 model). The XKR dives gloriously into corners, and gives you just enough hint of understeer to let you know to keep the rear end in line. After all, it is not a sports car, it's a GT, right? The suspension is perfect... compliant shocks that absorb everything the road throws at you, and stiffness to hold the line in long sweepers while negating all body roll. Then there is the ""sport"" mode, which actually does more than just alter shift points. It keeps the engine way up in the rev range to maximize your fun on country roads. The Supercharged V8 responds near-instantaneously and upshifts and downshifts are precise and smooth. The fit and finish is first rate. Wind buffeting at 70mph is minimal... conversations are capable up to 70 without shouting. And the car has a seriously good Alpine stereo so everyone can hear Led Zeppelin when I drop the top in only 18 seconds.  The cons are few: Pac Man graphics for the NAV, limited trip computer information and a lack of significant gauges (temp/oil/volts) are about it. Top-up, the ride is much quieter than many hardtop sedans and frankly the road/tire noise is less than my A8. I'll garage it over the winter months, and if reliability holds up, this will certainly be a long-term keeper.

jaguar,xkr,2000,RCD-XKR2000, 08/03/2005,Underappreciated Depreciated Cat,4,"Jaguar XKRs, particularly the coupes, are truly underappreciated IMHO. Low mileage 2000 XKR coupes now sell for about one-third of their original sticker price making them a truly affordable soon-to-be-classic. These cars have 370 supercharged horses, a silky smooth 5-speed mercedes transmission and are a styling masterpiece. One can easily put 2 bags of golf clubs in the trunk and have plenty of room for luggage in the back seat. And, the ride is completely civilized and quiet (almost too quiet). Reliability doesn't seem to be an issue and extended warranties are available for the risk adverse. The upcoming release of the new down-sized XK series should make these cars an even better value."
jaguar,xkr,2000,RCD-XKR2000, 07/31/2009,Supercar for a great price,5,"These are a great value used, especially the coupes. With some sensible modifications they can be excellent cars. I have had little or no maintenance issues with the car over 4 years of ownership. I did lower it, & added an x-pipe exhaust, larger wheels, and a black mesh grill. Of these changes, lowering and the growling exhaust are must do mods which greatly enhance the driving experience. The car looks great even though it is 10 years old and the coupes are relatively uncommon so valets tend to keep the car up front, relegating Mercedes SLs and Porsches to the rear. One great feature is the trunk which holds 2 golf bags plus luggage and the dog fits in the back seat, a highly practical GT."
jaguar,xkr,2000,Steve S, 04/18/2007,Work of art,4,Driving an XKR is like riding in a work of art.  Nothing beats the 99-04 body.  I do wish it had 6 speeds but the car was worth every penny. Less than 10k miles for 7 years.  Great acceleration and handling.  Passenger side window has a manufacturer's flaw and sometimes does not go back up when person exists.  I suggest a trickle charger to keep battery charged with the convertable. No regrets.

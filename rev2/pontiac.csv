pontiac,aztek,2001,miwright, 09/08/2009,Go ugly early!,4,"The Aztek was recently chosen as one of the ugliest cars ever built.  I concur.  It is also the most utilitarian car that was ever built.  Parents always teach that it's what's inside that counts.  I have head room galore, unprecedented comfort, and radio controls at my finger tips.  Add a heads-up display (nice for me, a pilot), a zip-in tent, sound system controls at the tailgate, an ice cooler for a console, myriad other creature features, and you have the best little house on wheels!  I pity the man that looks only on the external challenges of this fine automobile and misses its inner beauty. My other cars are a Jaguar VDP, a 300ZX and a Lexus... guess which I like the most?"
pontiac,aztek,2001,rodgerramjet47, 10/01/2010,New buyer needs help with quirk!,4,"Just bought for 15 yr old Son for him to drive in a 6 months, and wife now after some brainless driver side- swiped her beloved 2005 Screeming Yellow mustang!  Bought cheap and car is absolutely like new red/black GT AWD. Got from original owner who has regularly documented maint hx and new guaranteed trans.  SUV has intermittent very loud intermittent rattle that seems to come from left front.  Rattle comes on more when air is on, maybe(?) Thought at first to be worn/loose shocks, but with all the A/C comments, wondering if condenser is failing and making grinding noise-- RPM drop?  Note: Air bolws VERY cold!?  "
pontiac,aztek,2001,justin, 05/18/2010,great,4,never have had a problem with my aztek. runs great. a few things have gone wrong. but i got the car with 150k. should have gotten a bigger motor. but i can't complain. i know everyone thought they were ugly but i think they're one of the nicer mid level cars GM built.
pontiac,aztek,2001,Mina, 07/16/2010,It got a bad rap,4,"At first I thought it was just plain ugly!  Then I drove it and bought it, needing a car NOW.  Fun to drive, great U-turns, comfortable, enough features.  New engine at 72,000 miles - a piston/cylinder spring broke - but that's the only problem.  26 mpg on trips - really good for the space we had.  Seating was good, even used the tent and mattress once (we're older).  Liked having shoulder belt in middle of back seat.  Disgusted that Pontiac/GM didn't have a comparable sized replacement, now in 2007 Rendezvous.  Like that, but, again, discontinued."
pontiac,aztek,2001,billduffy, 02/28/2002,2001 Aztek GT,4,"I like this car, I've owned mine for about 3 months.
Lots of interior room and features.
Gas mileage is awesome for a big vehicle, I'm averaging 24 MPG. 

With all the bad press about this car, I thought people would
be laughing at me while I drive, but nothing like that has happened.
Everyone I talk to about the car like it.

I have some problems with build quality,
but these problems should be easy fixes
and be covered by warranty.

This car has been great!"
pontiac,aztek,2001,magicbus20, 05/05/2014,The Best UGLY car you could ask for.,3,"167,000 miles is much more than I wanted when getting my first vehicle. This thing was ok and gave me a great experience. It lasted a littler over 200,000 before I gave up on her. (I can't tell for sure because of a short in the odometer.) Which brings me to the first con, electronics. There were a couple of shorts and other weird things happening. The transmission started to shift hard and slip out of gear on hot days. 
Overall I trusted this car with my life. Usually got me point a to b until a cold winter day. Heater had gone for some time and finally she overheated and kicked the bed, or so I thought. Family mechanic brought her from the dead. Still rotting in the yard."
pontiac,aztek,2001,Andrea, 05/01/2002,Love my New SUV,4,"After only having this vehicle for a 
month, I don't think I could drive 
without it! It is so comfortable and 
easy to drive. I recommend it to anyone 
looking for a good mid-sized SUV."
pontiac,aztek,2001,BusinessOwner, 09/18/2009,Must Purchase!,5,"This vehicle is the best vehicle I have ever owned! I have nearly 170k miles on it and have never done a single thing to it, besides oil changes and tires. When I hear about peoples vehicles breaking down it shocks me because everything works on this Aztek and it is truly flawless! I have heard many wonderful things about them before purchasing but owning and drive makes me a believer! My next vehicle will be a low mileage Aztek (if I can find one)... And the styling is still sharp for it's age! I love my Aztek TCH"
pontiac,aztek,2001,Steve, 10/19/2005,Disappointment,2,"I cannot say enough about how unsatisfied I am with this car.  It is a complete lemon.  Air conditioner quit at 40,000.  New tranny at 57,000, and new engine parts at 61,000.  I still owe more than it's worth and am looking to sell it for much less.  I am very disappointed in this vehicle only because I love the space and its fun to drive.  But now i own a $20,000.. $7,000 car, after paying 10,500 for it and putting almost the same back into it to fix it.  Wish i had never purchased a Pontiac"
pontiac,aztek,2001,mjessup, 05/19/2006,Crazy Car....,3,"Loved this car...when I bought it still under warranty.  Super fun.  Good price.  Great camping-getup.  Cool features (heads-up display!!) Met all my needs for the 1st year.  Then the warranty ended and I've had nothing but problems.  Like the others: Air conditioner out X2, Head Gaskets, Brakes X2, Various Engine Parts, Fuel Pump, and CRAZY mechanical problems that just won't quit (ie: lights come on and stay on when nothing is wrong, security system locks up and shuts everything off while driving, gauges spin in circles, headlights turn off, once OnStar even started talking to me..and I'm not a subscriber... it really IS a Christine!!) I've spent more in repairs than payments. Never again."
pontiac,aztek,2001,Sonia, 09/10/2007,"Love My ""Azzy""",5,"We bought this car because we were ready to start traveling, and 93,000 miles later, it has been the most comfortable car for that, not to mention the decent gas mileage helps to fund our road trips. It has also hauled things from Lowes that people stood in the parking lot smiling because they didn't think it would fit...drop the back seats and it hauls very well."
pontiac,aztek,2001,DAVID, 03/27/2002,"NOT A COOKIE-CUTTER, IT RULES ALONE!",4,"EXCELENT VEICLE FOR THE MONEY! READ MY FAVORITES. HIGH QUALITY BUT IF YOU LIVE IN A COLD CLIMATE, DON'T EXPECT THE HATCH TO OPEN."
pontiac,aztek,2001,RUN!! AWAY!!, 08/19/2009,If your looking at getting a Aztek!! Run,3,"If you are looking at buying an aztek because they are roomy or because they have the cool camping package. You are not going to like it once you recive the bill! You are reading information from a real Pontiac aztek owner and I am (warning you plz do not buy this suv) yes you! I am sick and out of thousands! I cry everyday for what this aztek has done to me! I am a single mom and now have no car. I have owned this suv for 5 yrs and put a computer in, Windows dont work, 2head, oil pump, fuel pump, intake sensor, gas-Gage wont read, radiator, starter, conpressor, and now at 121,000 motor with a 4g bill! And I only have 4 payment left to make to the bank on it! Dont let it take you for a ride like it did me! Ty"
pontiac,aztek,2001,TonyaHarding, 10/14/2009,Switching To Ford or Foreign!,3,"When the Aztek was introduced, it was love at first sight! I just HAD to have one! Six pricey years later, I can't wait to get rid of it. I gave it a 5 for reliability because it's never broken down and left me stranded, but only a 5 because it's been one thing after another with this vehicle. Three A/C condensers,odometer went out so had to replace ENTIRE display, heat/AC control went out, dual temp control went out, head gasket, gas gauge doesn't work, driver side window, black trim paint started fading and peeling away when 4 years old, roof rack clamps rattle in wind, taillights and center brake light weathered & cracked @ 4 years. 5th GM car AND my last! Ford or foreign next time!"
pontiac,aztek,2001,Firsttime user, 04/28/2002,AZTEK,4,"Best part of the vehicle is the gas 
mileage with over 10,000 miles on the 
car we are averaging over 27 miles per 
gallon which includes city as well as 
highway driving.  Really handles well 
and is comfortable."
pontiac,aztek,2001,Kevin, 12/12/2008,"Good Car, But don't buy one used",4,"Smooth ride...very adaptable...nice sound system...great tailgate vechicle...good in snow...decent MPG. The problem is the parts, under the first warranty the AC condenser,head and tail lightbulbs, broken plastic trim (overhead interior) had to be replaced. On the advice of a service tech. I extended the warranty  what good advice...right after the first warranty expired the water pump, the starter, the 6-way power seat and the AC condenser (again), replaced. This is why people get mad and buy foreign because GM knew of these flaws and refused to fix them gratis...if you don't extend the warranty you're doomed. We still have it, and no problems I guess all the bugs are worked out."
pontiac,aztek,2001,Paul Johnston, 01/13/2009,Interesting & Fun,5,"When I first saw the uniqueness of this car, I fell in love. I did much research in the net and prowled dealerships before making the final decision. I have loved it from the first test drive to the present. With its slide out tray in the rear, makes loading and unloading a breeze. Love the tailgate seat, the air shocks are a God send and the compressor is very useful when in remote places. When driving on long trips, quite pleased with the mileage on the highway. Once I even got 40 Can. miles per gallon, not estimated but calculated. Did have to get the computer replaced but felt that it was something I did. No other major repairs so far to date. Loved its stability on the highway. "
pontiac,aztek,2001,bummed2008, 02/28/2009,getting rid,3,"Well, I wanted to like this thing, because of it's character. the interior has good design and fun to drive with decent power. and actually looks good. we loved taking this car to outside events and the kids could sit on the tailgate. here comes the sad part.. at only 40,000 miles we started having major electrical issues that were expensive and battery replacement was $600. now the head gasket or something is having trouble and tranny is slipping up hills.. this car is not a keeper. PS also had electrical issues on a 1999 Grand-Am when it was brand new. wont be buying a Pontiac any more and its a shame because I love how they feel and drive"
pontiac,aztek,2001,bobbobob, 05/25/2002,hmmm,2,"still cant get over the exterior 
styling, my son wanted one, my 
explored has better acceleration than 
it, and is not as ""out of the box"""
pontiac,aztek,2001,susanjskinner, 06/02/2002,Aztek is Terrific,5,"All we can say about our one year old 
Aztek is - FANTASTIK!  Cant understand 
why more people arent driving them - 
perhaps if the dealers made an effort 
to sell them (ours was in the back of 
the lot)--- very comfortable, great 
goodies, quiet ride, powerful...we love 
it!"
pontiac,aztek,2001,FST, 06/04/2002,excellent,4,"Fun , lot of space , good vision , 
confortable , I will buy an other one , 
buy in leather and full package or you 
will be disappointed , On star should 
be improved"
pontiac,aztek,2001,Donovan, 06/07/2002,DDB,5,"I chose all tens because I am selling one 
of these vehicles. but realistically, I 
would only have issues with a couple 
things. These are the gas mileage and the 
blind spots.  Power is great for a six 
banger.  The car is useful and the audio 
system is great."
pontiac,aztek,2001,mike, 09/22/2009,2001 Aztek things I learned,3,"I bought this car in 2008, with only 63K  miles on it for 5K.  Needed to put on new AC  condenser, which the dealership wanted $1,100.  I bought a reconditioned one on ebay for $200, and then a shop installed for $75 Also I problems with steering PULLING  hard left, and then hard right, until I noticed that  there were two different brand of tires on front.  Once I bought two new tires that matched, it drives like a dream.  I still get lights that flash on the dash, I keep taking it in, and , two weeks later they come on again."
pontiac,aztek,2001,LostNotForgotton, 10/23/2009,Love my Aztek,4,"I have never had a problem with my Aztek. I put nearly 30,000 miles a year on it and it has never given me any trouble. My Aztek is fully loaded with the exception of AWD and heated seats. The heads up display is a cool feature. The storage tray is convenient although if you set anything on it while drive it will slide around. I think the storage tray should have been coated with a rubber surface. The onboard air pump should be standard on all vehicles. I can pump up an air mattress, basketball  or all of my tires. The 6 disc in-dash CD player and factory 10 speaker Pioneer sound system are great. I would say the engine is a little under powered for the weight but overall I love my Aztek."
pontiac,aztek,2001,Mot76, 06/14/2002,2001 Aztek,4,"I like riding in something that's 
different from the rest. The more I 
look at my Aztek, the more it grows on 
me.  The fuel mileage is great for a 
vehicle like this with all wheel drive. 
The interior is well layed out and 
spacious.  It has more room than my 
friend's Four Runner. The sound system 
is one of the best I had yet!"
pontiac,aztek,2001,Best Vehicle Ever, 01/05/2010,Best Vehicle Ever!,5,"You must purchase this vehicle! It is hands down the best vehicle I have ever owned. I have purchased brand new vehicles time and time again. This time I thought it would be smart to pay cash for a vehicle. The Aztek's are priced low and literally the best vehicle I have ever owned. I work at a large dealership and it literally drives better than a brand new vehicle! Really reliable I've never had a problem which is amazing with such high mileage. This vehicle is in showroom condition even the leather is like new. Pontiac really made a sound vehicle this time! Really pround of my vehicle, and enjoy driving it each and everyday! After getting out of new vehicles I look forward to mine! Buy 1!"
pontiac,aztek,2001,derek16, 01/14/2010,keep it for life,5,I have had this car for about a year now and i love it! When i first got it the temp. gauge went out so i returned it to the car dealer ship. They tried to fix it but the just broke it even worse and the broke the gas gauge. But i know when im gonaa run out. It is in the shop because the air conditoner compresser fell off but what can u expect. Every car will need work done to it eventualy. I have treat this car like crap and it has only broke down onec. Everyone says that it is good on the snow but i have ran into many curbs and bent the rims. All in all this is the best car that i have had and i plan to switch to the torrent when this one goes out. Very roomy. Hope this was helpful. 
pontiac,aztek,2001,SUE, 08/17/2010,Not too sure.,2,"Bought this car from my in laws. What a bad choice. It was low on miles when I bought it from them. Fuel censor went, and they never replaced it. It was just 32 days after they purchased it. They had done some minor repairs on it. They barely drove it. So when I bought it 9 yrs old with 114k on it. I though I was laughing. I have now put it up to 154k in about 1 1/2 yrs. And the transmission just pooched on me a few days ago. The engine light comes on often, the breaks go, the gasket needs changing. No heat in the winter or air conditioner in the summer. And its been fixed repeatably. I am glad to hand over this hunk of junk. "
pontiac,aztek,2001,kinserc, 07/08/2002,Great Aztek,4,"Great Chassis! Styling is much improved 
over 2001.  I'm glad GM finally figured 
out that cladding isn't always the way 
to go."
pontiac,aztek,2001,daicom, 07/29/2002,Blind as a bat!!,3,"Geesh!!  what's up with the new azteks 
and their one color design? all of the 
2002 have the same plasta clad as the 
2001 models but poorly painted to mask 
the cladding, thats what happens when 
you paint over textured plastic, so to 
all of you 2002 owners, yes your 
pontiac aztek has plastic cladding 
under the less than desirable bumpy 
finish, oh minus a few lines, but it's 
still there. No brain surgeon needed to 
figure that out."
pontiac,aztek,2001,mjpieters, 08/02/2002,"Just get in one, alright?",4,"It is a pity reviewers have been
cracking down on the looks. We love the
Aztek, and choose it in part for its
styling.

Aztek's strenghts are in its interiour
and ride. With Tracking Control, the
Aztek will get you out of more bad
situations than your average SUV; an
inside so spacious people that get
into our car get out again to see how
the outside holds it all.

Edmunds came to the same
conclusion. After running with the pack
in condemning the Aztek looks, Edmunds
turned around and came back on their
views with a Follow Up where the
reviewer actually sat in the car, and
tried it.

If you are looking for an all-round car,
test the Aztek. I bet you will be sold."
pontiac,aztek,2001,almoh, 08/19/2002,People ask to look inside,3,"It is the first vehicle we have had 
where people have asked about it and 
asked to look inside.  We have been 
approached in parking lots, even 
classic car gatherings."
pontiac,aztek,2001,aztec, 08/22/2002,Pontiac Aztek Wind Noise,3,"At highway speed (70 mph) the wind 
noise is excessive, so much that you 
can not talk on the cell phone or carry 
on a normal conversation. The 
manufacture calls this a wind 
turbulence and admits that it is 
there,however they will not fix or 
replace this defective vehicle."
pontiac,aztek,2001,B. Adams, 09/10/2002,Ugly Duck gives you a bang for your buck,4,"Captain's chairs are great except for 
skinny armrests which are not 
comfortable at all. Car gets fantastic 
gas mileage...Car is exceptionally 
heavy compared to other SUV's but get 
the 16"" wheels for much better 
handling.Car is sluggish and 
acceleration is only fair. Cornering is 
another challenge. ABS brakes are ok 
but again you've got a lot of weight to 
stop...The Aztek is super roomy with 
great head room.. The biggest problem 
with this car is rear visibility-there 
is none...there is a major design flaw 
with the back end.If you like a car 
that is different and cost a GM V.P.of 
design his job...the Aztek is for 
you."
pontiac,aztek,2001,LVMYAZTK, 10/09/2002,Best thing out there!!!!,5,"I love my Aztek!!  A cool looking 
midsize SUV with all the features of a 
luxury SUV.  This is the best thing out 
there, in my opinion.  I can't believe 
it is not more popular.  It is 
comfortable, sporty, practical and 
FUN!  I love driving it!"
pontiac,aztek,2001,Jackee, 10/31/2002,Pontiac Aztek,4,"The 2001 exterior design was an improvement over the 2000 model.  It is 
sporty and fun.  The mileage surpassed all expectations.  I was getting over 
27 miles to the gallon while on vacation.  The slide-out cargo tray is 
wonderful when loading and unloading packages, no aching backs.  The 
back is spacious and will handle lots of packages.  I had done a lot of 
research regarding this vehicle and it is living up to everything I had read, and 
in some respects it is even better."
pontiac,aztek,2001,bossman, 11/01/2002,Unique Aztek Owners.,4,"Having owned the Aztek for the last 
year and a half we have experienced a 
couple of computer problems which 
required the replacement of the 
component as well as a minor door 
problem. We have had as many approving 
glances as disapproving. We tow a 1500 
lb. tent trailer and find that the 
vehicle handles well for long distance 
towing, long distance travel without 
the trailer is comfortable as well. We 
love driving the vehicle and would buy 
another."
pontiac,aztek,2001,Steevie Weevie, 10/07/2002,Thees es no toaster humper!,4,"Let others rave about the super 
comfortable leather seats, heads-up 
display, well-laid-out instruments and 
switches, and ro-o-o-om. Living in 
Tucson, I appreciate the dark factory 
window tinting and ample air 
conditioner. I keep a scrapbook full of 
Aztek-bashing articles for passengers&#8217; 
amusement. It&#8217;s really hilarious for 
four big adults to be cruising smoothly 
and comfortably along listening to 
great sounds spilling out of the 10 
speakers while reading some writer&#8217;s 
garbage prose about a CRX on steroids 
and the unholy spawn resulting when an 
SUV humped a toaster."
pontiac,aztek,2001,PhillyAztekBoy, 12/14/2002,2 Years and 57K miles later....,4,"This car still runs good.  I do alot of 
communiting back and forth to work, and 
have not had any problems whatsoever!  
I still get people come up to me and 
ask ""What is that?  I like it!""  For my 
few gripes 1)The hatch gets stuck way 
to often and I have to press the 
release button more than once. 2)GM 
made it hard to use after-market 
equipment (i.e. stereo stuff). I had to 
relocate the factory radio under the 
backseat. 3)Wish steering was a little 
more powerful.
Good car folks.  I love it!!"
pontiac,aztek,2001,maroguy, 02/16/2008,Great SUV Good Mileage Bad Reliability,4,"I have owned it for 2 years all out of warranty. I only have 80k miles on it.  Getting sick of repairing it.  Previous owner had rear carrier, more wheel bearings, intake gasket, anti lock brake harnesses, and the dreaded ac condenser all replaced under warranty at least."
pontiac,aztek,2001,vern, 01/13/2003,Az to me,4,"Would purchase again, gets bad reveiws 
because people haven't driven, once 
driven loved. Certin colors combos 
stink and could use a little more 
agressive posture."
pontiac,aztek,2001,johnnyl, 01/24/2003,The Ugly Duck,4,"That's really a Swan.  Fun to drive.  I 
can give sports sedans a run for their 
money.  Great get up and go.  Excellent 
features. Love both the interior and 
exterior."
pontiac,aztek,2001,morgan59, 02/16/2003,So ugly it's cute,5,"I was out looking to buy my 3rd Ford 
Exploer. Then I ended up at the 
Pointiac dealer looking at an Aztek, at 
1st I thought it was ugly then as I 
looked at it, it got cuter I looking 
inside of it I was very impressed. I 
drove it and was sold I went back to my 
Ford dealer and looked at what I got 
for the same money. The Exploer was so 
plain,the new silver pastic inside the 
sport is cheap looking and feeling So 
back to Pointic I went. Bottom line My 
AWD Aztec is great. There's more space 
than the exploer more power,BTW most 
the new SUV types coming out they're as 
far out styled if not more than the 
Aztec. ie: frist drives 05 cars in 
MT,C&D, auto week etc."
pontiac,aztek,2001,AztekHeather, 06/11/2003,AWESOME!!!!! This is the best car ever!,5,"My 2001 Yellow Aztek GT (YAz) is the 
most fun car I've ever owned.  
Versatility, comfort, surprising 
luxury, and great gas mileage are some 
of the many reasons why I fell in love 
with YAz.  But mostly, he's unique and 
just plain fun to Tek around in!"
pontiac,aztek,2001,tc122196, 06/12/2003,Awesome All Around!!! AAA,4,"I bought my Aztek used with over 40,000 
miles on it.  But it still runs as if 
its brand new. I have never had so much 
fun driving a vehicle.  Its as if 
people that drive an Aztek have a group 
all of their own.  I recently had a guy 
come up to me at the mall while my 
husband and I were putting our 
purchases away..he put his arm around 
me and said You like yours as well as I 
like mine?  I said oh yes!  Other Aztek-
ians wave when you pass..complete 
strangers!  Fun Fun Fun!!! Our next 
vehicle is already decided to be 
another Aztek!"
pontiac,aztek,2001,T&J in FLA, 08/23/2003,3 years old & still fun to drive,4,"After 3 yrs and 45000 miles it's still 
fun to drive. Also with 2 growing boys 
they've never complained about not 
having enough room in the back seat. 
People say it's ugly but have you 
noticed that alot of the high end  
suv's are starting to look a lot like 
aztec's?  "
pontiac,aztek,2001,tniepoth, 07/21/2003,Lost 60% of it's value in two years OUCH,3,"It lost 60% of it's value in the first 
two years.  After only 30,000 miles, 
the A/C has gone out, the rear hatch 
hinge is defective, and the 
transmission whines terribly when it's 
warmed up and goes uphill.  Trying to 
get out from under this one. 

The only thing I like is the fact that 
the back seats come out giving a low, 
flat floor so that I can load my 3 big 
dogs with room to spare."
pontiac,aztek,2001,carguy2549, 09/18/2003,Best Car I ever owned,5,"Comfort-unbeatable. Style-like it or 
don't-I like it.  Driving-fantastic.  
Economy-with 54,500 miles my overall 
average is 23.9.  Love that computer. 
Ihave the top model but in FWD with 
traction control.  Snow is nothing to 
me.  the heads up display is great.  
All the other cars are catching on the 
the style thing.  I just don't like 
rounded corners.  OH, as far as the 
rear wiper goes, you don't need one.  
The dirt just blows away and window 
stays clean."
pontiac,aztek,2001,janiebaby, 09/27/2003,Love my AZTEK,5,"I loved the look of the Aztek when they 
first came out.  They do not look like 
every vehicle out there on the roads.  
It was an easy transistion from 
the ""mom"" mini-van to the Aztek.
Because of my vehicle, 3 others have 
bought Azteks.  :-)"
pontiac,aztek,2001,Raymon, 12/09/2004,Buyer beware,2,Replaced the air conditioning unit 6 times the first 4 years. Major electrical problems. No way to open rear hatchbach if latch fails. Except by destroying the gate interior panel. No warrantee package covers interior repair. Not a good experience. 
pontiac,aztek,2001,handsym, 10/05/2003,Very satisified,4,"I have had 3 trouble-free years of 
service from this vehicle.  The ride 
is great and extremly quiet.  My wife 
wants to get a new one, but the one we 
have has been so good, that we are 
holding off."
pontiac,aztek,2001,2001 Aztek Owner, 02/13/2005,"95,000 miles in first 2 years",4,"This car has been a pleasure to drive. I love the HUD, the rear stereo controls.  The vehicle is very responsive and has pretty good zip.  Had 2 irritating problems in first year.  A/C compressor went out and due to the miles I was putting on at the time my warranty was out and Pontiac refused to take care of the problem.  Also, some kind of sensor for the fuel pump went out and again Pontiac would not help.  This is a great handling SUV/SRV and it is a shame it has not taken off.  If not for the extremely poor resale value I would consider buying another."
pontiac,aztek,2001,Bartwod, 11/05/2003,"""Never buy a first year car""",3,"I love my Aztek.  It is easy to get in 
and to get out.  I like the feeling of 
sitting taller than a car.  The 
controls for the radio are in the 
steering wheel and it is easy to use.  
I do not like leaning over the back 
gate 
to load groceries and unload. I have 
had many problems that were quite 
expensive and was told by one service 
department person, ""Well, m'am, you did 
buy a first year automobile.""  Well, I 
love the car, but GM has not responded 
to any of my letters or emails about 
the problems.    This is a wonderful 
car for those over 50 but GM brought 
out the Buick and stopped advertizing 
this car.   "
pontiac,aztek,2001,NoMoreGM, 11/22/2003,Huge disappointment,2,"I have had EXTENSIVE problems 
(complete electrical system meltdown 
was the main one) with this vehicle. 
It had been in the shop 12 times in 
less than 15 months and 20000 miles. 
This car was recalled for a ""battery 
discharge condition"" (see NHTSA 
website for details). The dealership 
was useless to fix the problem; they 
just kept replacing the battery and 
cleaning the spilled battery acid off 
the engine and sending me on my way. I 
complained to GM and they refused to 
fix the car also. There are many good 
reviews from Aztek owners on Edmunds, 
so my case must be an isolated 
incident. But after my horrible 
experience, I cant see myself buying 
another one. "
pontiac,aztek,2001,okiechemist, 07/26/2005,I don't see the outside behind the wheel,4,"I bought my 2001 Aztek in October 2001.  I have really enjoyed it.  I did and do catch a lot of comments from friends about its looks but I just commented that ""When I'm driving the car I can't see the outside.""  Incidently, the same people who give me the hard time are also the ones who request help hauling things, or wanting to use my car for trips (it does have a lot more room).  "
pontiac,aztek,2001,Borders, 08/25/2005,Will not buy another Aztek,3,"We purchased our Aztek used in 2003. Had very low miles & fully loaded. Had taken it in last winter to fix condenser on A/C unit & to repair head gasket. Major work. Since we had no warranty left, luckily GM came through & paid for the parts (1/2 the total price). We had to pay for the labor which still cost us $1,000.00. When driving long distance, neck tend to get sore & tense. The back hatch doesn't release on the 1st try. ABS system makes noises sometimes. Will buy Toyota or Honda next. They tend to stand buy their product!! "
pontiac,aztek,2001,jqua, 01/05/2004,smooth as silk but poor quality control,4,"This vehicle has a love it/hate it
design.  Typical of GM there were 1st yr
problems.  An ABS Sensor died twice in
18 months.  the rear hatch doesn't open
using one push of the switch. Several
computers failed.
A/C compressor failed.  All during
warranty period but down time was a
pain.  Wonderful car to drive, handles
well, very smooth on the road."

is very comfortable...UNTIL I had to 
take it in for the recall on the 
battery discharge problem which I 
wasn't haveing. The computer blew and 
I had to wait 2 weeks to get a new 
one. That was 3 computer systems ago 
and still have tons of trouble with 
electrical system and I have replaced 
all the lights and fuses over and 
over.Not to mention all the sensors 
going haywire and not working. Also 
the AC goes out at least one or two 
times a summer. Dealership was as nice 
as they could be but no help. But 
Pontiac was NO HELP and did nothing 
about it. Ruined me on Pontiacs and 
this was my 3rd and last of their

We sprung for all the amenities and it 
was worth it.  I love the look on 
people's faces when they see me driving 
it.  It isn't ugly, just different!  It 
also has saved me from many an accident 
due due the traction control.  We have 
been everywhere with it, including the 
mountains in a snowstorm.  We did have 
a problem with it (first year model!!)

36,882 miles on it. Fully loaded 
leather nice sound package, onstar, 
headsup display and the air compressor, 
who would have ever thought of that! 
what an awesome car. oh and for our 
insurance that was the best. Apparently 
it is a very safe vehicle, out of the 
possibility of 40% discount, our Aztec 
was rated for a 30% discount from State 
Farm Mutual. Quiet, handled well in a 
30-45 mph wind (head on and crossway)
and who can argue with 26 MPG!!! VERY 
VERY SOLD.. and again and again!"

can you get a mid-sized American SUV with AWD, 
heated leather seats, side air bags, 10 speaker

fighter - for $10,000 less than a Ford Explorer or 
Jeep Grand Cherokee?  (And with better gas 
mileage, and lowest rollover risk)"
pontiac,aztek,2001,xedf003, 03/23/2004,bryan's aztek,4,"i thank the aztek is a great srv
for the active lifestyle that alot
of people have today, but the
press have such a square minded outlook
on cars and trucks that if it looks
diffrent than any other car or truck
they are to soon to knock it. A gm is
so worried about the prss's opion that
they have not done alot of promotions
on the srv!!!!. Saying all of that, for
the features and price this is the best

pontiac,aztek,2001,jrd farms, 03/19/2004,2001 Aztek front wheel drive,4,"The mileage ave 22 in town and 27

The front seats aren't all that 
comfortable for me- but my husband is 
bigger and fits very comfortably. 
Dealer service 2x;the radio
(am,fm,cassette,cd), the check engine 
light module needed replaced (65000 
miles).
I have a whistle sound when the weather 
is cold but as the car warms up the 
sound goes away. (The dealer told me 
that it is the throttle housing and 
won't hurt to not have it replaced-just 
annoying).
Versitile interior, the rear seats 
fold, or remove which gives me lots of 
options."
pontiac,aztek,2001,Aztank, 03/24/2004,Traveling Tek,4,"The Tek is a great vehicle for our 
lifestyle, we love to camp, bike and 
canoe and have been on several trips 
with it. We get about 24 mpg on the 
highway unless we're pulling 
bikes/canoe then we get about 20mpg.  
The functionality and gas mileage sold 
us on the Tek. The exterior caused us 
to dub ours ""Aztank"" because of the 
boxy lines, however, it has really 
grown on me. Bottom line, you get a 
large, practical and efficient vehicle 
for a great value, Azteks make a 
statement and are extremely practical 
but if you have to have a vehicle that 
EVERYbody envies you won't want an 
Aztek."

pontiac,aztek,2001,jb03, 04/14/2004,What's that?,4,"This is our second Aztek, and yes, we 
still have the first one. I love the 
styling, I love the interior. I JUST 
LOVE MY PONTIAC! Everyone 
asks.. ""what's that."" And I have to go 
into detail about what a cross-over SUV 
is, and what it isn't. You can not 
mistake this for any vehicle on the 
road (albeit its sister, the Rendezvous 
from Buick.) For anyone looking for 
room, fun, good gas mileage, and 
comfort, the Aztek is the edgy, hip way 
to go! Not to mention you can take it 
camping with the optional Camping 
Package."
pontiac,aztek,2001,pfcgtmw, 04/14/2004,Problems That Cost Money,3,"First, anyone who complains about the 
look of the vehicle was stupid for 
purchasing in the first place. 33,000 
miles intake gasket leaked and was 
replaced.  35,000 air conditioner went 
out.  Found a leak in condensor & put 
in new.  47,000 antifreeze leaking 
which has been estimated at $1300.  
driver's side door sticks.  only had 
vehicle for a little over a year so I 
am not impressed.  GM will not do 
anything about the problems."
pontiac,aztek,2001,Wally Crane, 04/15/2004,Wally's Tec,4,"I liked the style and reviews on the net art 
the time.  I had a few problems, one major.  
Modules have had to be replaced,  Trunk 
opener had to be adjusted, some gauges 
recalibrated, all under warranty.  The major 
prob was the trans. At 43,000 it fell apart. 
After some struggle GM paid for 1/2.  I still 
enjoy the tek though."
pontiac,aztek,2001,bigwicker, 04/23/2004,Great car,4,"My second Aztek.  Handles beautifully.  
Comfortably but a fairly firm ride 
considering it's build.  26 mpg hwy @ 
80mph w. AC.  Great room.  Can't 
understand why Edmunds lists it as mid-
size.  No matter how fully loaded, I 
always seem to be able to see out the 
reah hatch.  Great handling.  I always 
know exactly where the front bumper 
is.  A joy to park and maneauver in 
tight spots.  Quick enough.  Dependable 
so far (80k miles) Criticism:  Spoiler 
on rear hatch encumbers rear view 
vision.  Rear hatch doesn't want to 
release in cold weather.  Lousy trade-
in value...completely unjustified.  
Great car.  "
pontiac,aztek,2001,booger's owner, 08/23/2006,the booger mobile,4,i love this car.  i have looked at different SUVs like the element or the mazda 3 hatchback but cannot find the fun stuff on my car like the tailgate party feature with the stereo controls in the back and the seat on the tailgate wit the cup holders.  it is the most unique automobile that i have ever driven.  my dad has an aztek with over 100K miles on it.  i'm heading up to 75K with only a few problems that i have learned happen in other GM cars like the intake manifold gasket replacement.  i also had to replace the condenser which i understand happens to quite a few other aztek owners.  all in all this is an aweaome SUV to drive and it gets plenty of looks! i love all the space inside!!!
pontiac,aztek,2001,slapp1, 04/30/2004,Not bad...kinda odd looking though,4,"I bought this vehicle because I needed 
something bigger with a new child in 
the house. I couldn't bring myself to 
buy a minivan. I was unexpectedly 
surprised. I bought an AWD version 
with the 6 disc CD changer and ten 
speaker stereo and the stereo is LOUD!
It has been a capable handler in deep 
snow and rain and I am pretty happy 
with it. The black color helps blend 
that odd bodyside cladding and I feel 
it looks good. I have driven it cross 
country many times so far and I have 
not had any mechanical problems except 
for an A/C problem that just cropped 
up. This is being fixed under warranty 
by the way."
pontiac,aztek,2001,William R Peterson, 06/22/2004,2001 Pontiac Aztek,4,"I have really enjoyed owning my Aztek

differant from what other auto makers 
were offering."

well.  Looks cool inside and out.  Can 
carry lots of stuff but it's not a 
minivan or just another SUV."
pontiac,aztek,2001,marycat, 07/11/2004,never again,3,"I loved my Aztek for the 1st year. Then 
the problems began.  I had it towed 3 
times. The engine would continually 
stall. When it was towed to the garage 
it would run and they could find nothing 
wrong. I was not the only one this 
happened to. You can hear the wind 
through the passenger window which I 
have also fixed 3 times and it still 
does it.  My SES is alway on and there 
is nothing wrong. I have given up on 
paying for that to be checked My heater 
went out the 2nd year (l live in WI and 
need a heater) This year air conditioner 
went out. Now I am stuck and cant afford 
a new car."
pontiac,aztek,2001,jan kaiser, 09/02/2004,aztec lover,4,"I've enjoyed my Aztec enough to by

sporty."
pontiac,aztek,2001,CreativScreename, 12/12/2004,Love My Aztek!!,4,"I bought my '01 (first year model) Aztek GT w/ all the fixin's almost one year ago.  I bought the vehicle for a long backroad trip around the US w/ my dog.  It was perfect.  Never gave me one bit of trouble on my 8,000 mile trip.  Lots of room for large pets.  I love the camping package and the car as a whole is roomy and uncomplicated.  SO fun to drive!!  I've only taken the car in once and that was simply to change the headlights.  The only downfall is that you have to remove multiple objects under the hood to install new ones.  It is something of a gas guzzler, as most SUVs are.  "
pontiac,aztek,2001,sherry, 02/25/2005,"I love the look, hate the unreliability",3,"I absolutely love my Aztek. The look, the drive, the storage. Okay, the hatch sticks, and you need to use the fob as you lift up the back hatch or else it locks again. I have 56,000 miles, first it was the electrical wiring with the headlight, then wiring with the starter, now its the transmission. My mechanic shrugged and said it's the same Grand Am transmission. $2,000 repair! I need reliable!I can do without cute! I'm so disappointed!"
pontiac,aztek,2001,AztekSteve, 04/01/2005,Loaded GT w/On-Star is way to go!,4,"An Aztek GT with the leather and cargo and camper package with ON-Star is a great package.  Sure, with any Aztek that has On-Star you sacrifice the sunroof... But oh what a gain! Be mindful of the On-Star.  Most 2001 and 2002 models use the older analog system.  I have had to tell my local GM service department more about fixing it properly than they know. "
pontiac,aztek,2001,koriseyes, 07/20/2005,Why the major problems with no recalls?,3,"The vehicle is really a nice vehicle but, and this is a big but.  There are alot of problems with this car and I haven't owned it a year. The a/c condenser is bad, so for most of the summer in 90 degree weather, I've been a hot tamale. The cluster is bad in a spot or two. The odometer does not work. How is this supposed to affect my resale value when you can't see the mileage. Not to great I would imagine. And now it sounds like I may have the first Aztek to be apart of NASCAR. Everytime I turn a corner I sound like I'm burning rubber. I'm sure by now that Pontiac/GM know by now that every year of the Aztek has major problems so why is there not help to fixing these problems? Uh? REcall!"
pontiac,aztek,2001,Nick, 08/24/2005,Ugly but REALLY practical,4,"Best bang for the buck in mid-size U.S. SUVs.  Roomier than an S-10 Blazer, safer than the current blazer, and gets 21 mpg FOR HALF THE PRICE OF MANY MID-SIZED SUVs.  FIRST SUV to get 4 star rollover rating and how many 2001 SUVs had standard side airbags? Sure its ugly, but how many $50k luxury SUVs have a heads-up display on the windshied off of an F-15 fighter, a built-in air pump, and their own tent?!  "

pontiac,aztek,2001,jimaztek123, 03/20/2003,Love it!,4,"I love my Aztek every time I go to the
local home improvement store.  One of
the main reasons I bought it is the low,
wide cargo space.  Can fit 4x8 sheets
flat!  It's certainly the best value in
it's class.  Yes the back end is ugly. 
Guess that's why they're not flying off
the lots.  No homeowner should be
without one though!  It's also
inexpensive enough that I don't sweat
banging it up a bit."
pontiac,aztek,2001,Joanne, 11/29/2006,Nice vehicle,4,I really enjoy this car.  I sit up high and it does what I want it to do at about half the price of other similar SUVs.  I think it's a shame Pontiac stopped production of this model.
pontiac,aztek,2001,rmbmt, 03/23/2003,Wife loves it,4,"My wife drives almost 20k a year and 
loves this.  We sold our Durango and am 
happpy we did as this gets around 23mpg 
and the Durango got 14.  My main 
complaint so far is that the temp gauge 
will often appear as if the car is 
running warm.  The dealer has checked 
it several times and said it is ok - so 
I guess we all should believe the 
dealers - right?"
pontiac,aztek,2001,joebenko, 04/01/2003,All Around Vehicle,4,"Fun car to drive. Responsive to the

pontiac,aztek,2001,Calyn, 04/12/2003,Mechanical Difficulties,2,"I have driven the Pontiac Aztec for 
almost 3 yrs and I have had difficulty 
with the condensor for the air 
conditioner 2 summers straight. 
The condensor was leaking and cracked 
both times and had to be brought to 
dealership for repair of the same
problem. The information lights 
continously come on and display 
inaccurate information. The air-bag 
light comes on and stays on.  Outside 
of mechanical problems, it is a fun 
car to drive but I would never purchase 
another one of it's kind and I would 
encourage not purchasing a car before 
it has been on the road for at 
least 2 years."
pontiac,aztek,2001,corey76, 03/06/2002,Best in class!,4,"Simply put, I compared the Aztek to just about everything.  It beat out all of it's competition in so many important areas it was ridiculous!  Well it didn't win in every part, but if it didn't win, it was an equal.  Then with the incentives they are offering, it was the best deal!  So really it was a no brainer!  Anyway I have a 2002, Black with lots of options, I love the new style and I highgly recommend it!"
pontiac,aztek,2001,AKMelnick, 03/29/2007,Love it!,4,"I find the Aztek fun to drive, love all the cool features such as music controls on steering wheel.

I love the look! "

 Had been looking for a year, running the gamut from Subarus, to GMC Envoy.
 Aztek presented the best compromise of space,low entry, power, comfort,towing ability, and lots of bells and whistles! ;-)
 Have had no problems whatsoever and continue to feel I made the best decision."
pontiac,aztek,2001,borglette, 03/06/2002,Aztecs are worth it!,5,"We have been driving a 2001 Aztec for over a year.  The look of the vehicle is what attracted us into test driving one.  It's definitely not the boring mainstream SUV style, inside or out.  We were searching for a larger vehicle than we currently had but didn't want to get stuck driving an SUV bus.    The Aztec is extremely roomy inside and the shape lends to it's versatility.  It's very smooth riding, very comfortable to drive and gets excellent gas mileage."
pontiac,aztek,2001,Dave Szigety, 06/20/2007,I can't win!,3,"If this car were only reliable, it would be a dream. Problem is, every couple months something breaks and it's never anything cheap! Two manifold gaskets in 3 years, new A/C condenser last year is leaking again already, the C/D radio fried itself and now the the hydraulic lifts on the rear hatch have gone with no warning! I have always treated this car right (maintenance, oil changes, etc.) and following the wisdom of the Car Guys on NPR, I've always driven it like my mother-in-law was sitting beside me. This is my third Pontiac in a row and each has been worse. I'd still be driving my '92 Grand Prix if it hadn't been totalled! Goodbye Pontiac, goodby GM...period end!"

it. I Love everything about this

My boys not only fit into the Aztec, they LOVE it, and they'll be able to fit in it when they're in high school!  I took out a Le Sabre before I took out the Aztec, and found the ride was the same.  I thought the ride would be typical SUV.  I wouldn't buy no sissy ride!"
pontiac,aztek,2001,Tusktek, 06/04/2003,Get over it!,4,"I test drove a lot of vehicles. I was 
going to buy either an SUV or a Grand 
Prix GTP. Due to comfort reasons, 
chose GTP. Went into dealership for 
GTP came out with 2001 Aztek GT."
pontiac,aztek,2001,Cleveburg, 06/08/2003,Lease Is Over And I'm Buying It,4,"We had one of the first on the street 
in 2000 and opted to lease as a safer 
option that purchasing given the car 
was the first crossover design.  People 
tell me its ugly but for the money, its 
been a great value and practical in too 
many ways to list.  
The lease is just about up and we're 
thinking about purchasing it given the 
buy-out price is less than the residual 
lease value.  We did just have some 
major warranty work - A/C compressor 
and a head gasket so I'm probably going 
to go with an extended warranty to 
address the anxiety factor.  Besides, 
if you want unique, you see fewer of 
these on the road than those new SUV 
crossovers costing over fifty grand!"
pontiac,aztek,2001,alchemy3, 03/12/2002,Buyer Beware: Read before Purchasing,4,"Do not buy a 2001 Aztek.  The 2002 are at least
$4,000 cheaper!  This is not something the
dealers will tell you.  I bought a 2001
just before the 2002 came out, the dealer 
told me ""no significant difference in price.""

So far GM and Pontiac have said, Tough, 
not our problem its yours.  So basically
they have no customer loyalty."
pontiac,aztek,2001,guyver53402, 03/18/2002,used,4,"just bought a used aztek awd, went to minnesota and back,820 miles, quiet and comfortable. I like the cargo capacity and rear bench room for my 3 kids. 23mpg doing 74 mph ave.  Anyone having mech probs. I am going to get a extended warranty because of my past experience with american vehicles"
pontiac,aztek,2001,aztek39, 03/22/2002,Aztek from Mexico,4,"Has a very comforable ride, drives like a car,  city gas mileage varies from 19 in the summer to 16 in the Winter. Highway milage is about 25  can hold alot of stuff. very good workmanship."

I use it in many capacities from business trips and lunches, to camping, cycling, and hiking. It is appropriate for both! Fun to drive, good designs, comfortable, and reliable. Great traction on snow and ice!!!"
pontiac,aztek,2001,Babydoll, 03/26/2019,"My Baby, still going strong",5,"Bought my 2001 Aztec brand new $24,000. In 2001 that was $$$$$. Shortly after buying they stopped making the Aztec. Now 18 yr later she's only got 108,000 miles on it. She's been an awesome car. I've been tempted to get a new one but can't seem to part with her and why do so? Luckily I've only been out $5,000 in maintenance/repairs.
"
pontiac,aztek,2002,talia5307, 05/10/2009,Great Car - Fun to Drive,4,"I bought my Aztek almost 7 years ago and have never regretted it.  It now has 98000 miles on it and has only ever needed minor repairs (brakes, etc).  I love that nothing else on the road looks like it, this is not your cookie cutter car for your cookie cutter neighborhood.  The ride is smooth, quiet and comfortable and the car handles well in my northern Illinois winters even with just FWD.  My only complaints are that the back seats don't fold flat, but not many 2002 vehicles do.  Also, the bottom of the back window is totally flat, which leaves it almost always dirty."
pontiac,aztek,2002,Cathy, 09/25/2008,Love-d It!,5,"Bought it new and liked its uniqueness. Yellow is easy to spot in the Wal-Mart parking lot! Very comfy for tall people and all seats recline for long trips.  Interior is  durable,everything in the right place. Most room for a mid-size SUV--I put several large trees and numerous plants in this thing! If they made them again, I'd buy one. Mine was 2WD and handled very well in snow/ice.  The only reason I don't have one now is because a tornado destroyed it! had over 144K and ran great."
pontiac,aztek,2002,M.D.Levine, 05/20/2016,This Aztek won't scalp you!,5,"No longer made..........Parts availability  is diminishing for glass and body items, purchased new..
problems with rear lift gate from the get go.....never repaired properly at dealer. Now won.t open at all!  Always been solid mechanically....paint durability is superior...paid for optional paint sealant, well worth extra fee. Still bright and shiny after 14+ years  in Florida Sun. Typical GM interior issues, window switches,   4-Way seat switches,radio and steering wheel switches ;Top of Dash and steering wheel show sun exposure damage. This was an experiment by GM having produced car in Mexico. all my friends thought this car wouldn't last a couple of years, with due respect to the Mexican assembly plant this car was built well! When purchased I actually wasn't aware it was made in Mexico.
"
pontiac,aztek,2002,not happy, 06/11/2008,Bad experience,2,"Bought used with about 60k miles, at 63k all the problems began with the check engine light. GM said it was the ECM, electronic control module.  It resembles a long cable (wrapped in black plastic) that is underneath the car and plugs into a socket like thing on the undercarriage.  Very exposed to the road elements! GM wanted $1100 for the part & another $900 to install.  I paid, and the engine light still stayed on.  GM tried to say it was not the ECM after I paid $2,000! I took it back to the Dealer prior to any of this, that was a hoot. That is another story.  I could not get the car inspected, so traded it recently, took a beating and learned a lesson, run away from Pontiac Cars!"
pontiac,aztek,2002,aztec hater, 12/11/2008,"We call it the ""crapteck""",3,"Loved the car at first! Very comfortable and roomy--fits 4 and a dog very comfortably.  Was very excited to get our first SUV and loved it for about a year. The air conditioner died at about 17k, the head gasket at 30K, the hatch never opens, anti theft system locked up for no reason & cost about $500 to replace. Head gasket again at 120K. I have a $50,000 car after all of the repairs that have been made on it--wise to quit producing this vehicle."
pontiac,aztek,2002,Joe, 06/16/2009,LOVE HATE RELATIONSHIP,3,"I love my aztek for its practicality and verstility.  There s tons of room for my kids, dog and gear. Unfortunatley its got reliability issues.  All the wheel bearing have been replaced, computers have failed. Versatrak rear differential was replaced for $6000.  Head gasket leaked.  Whats next?  I m torn because I like the car so much but I m scared of whats going to break next. My next car is definately not going to be a GM."
pontiac,aztek,2002,amps333, 04/20/2002,"VERY HAPPY, I'VE HAD 2",5,"I actually have a 2001 FWD. The initial 
start has excellent power and speed, 
merging and passing is done with ease. 
Very smooth and comfortable on the 
highway and spunky throuhg the city.I 
test drove alot of other manufacturers 
and unless you double the price and 
still end up with lower gas mileage and 
less amenities then you start to get 
close to what the Atztec offers. And 
the plastic sides some of you don't 
like works well for accident 
protection. A station wagon side swiped 
the front end and left NO sratches or 
dent. I dont think paint could have 
handled it!"
pontiac,aztek,2002,ladymage, 04/21/2002,LOVE my Aztek!,4,"Any snide remarks end as soon as I take 
people for a ride. The ride is smooth, 
the seats are comfortable even on long 
rides, with plenty of room (inc. the 
back seat). The inside has wonderful 
layout - everything clear and in reach. 
All the gadgets are great in use. Cargo 
space is good (love the sliding tray), 
sound system is solid (extra controls 
on wheel a +)and handling is great. Fun 
to drive, easy to handle, reliable, and 
the best thing next to a pickup for 
hauling stuff (rear seats easy to fold 
or remove). Very versatile and all 
around solid vehicle on the highway or 
a dirt road. ...And it's easy to find 
in a parking lot ;)"
pontiac,aztek,2002,comscan, 04/27/2002,My Aztek,4,"So far the vehicle has proven to be 
both reliable and safe to drive, I live 
in Calgary Canada aaand my Aztek has 
proved it's self more than capable of 
handling all of the snow we receive 
here during day to day driving. Also 
during this period the heating system 
has been more than adequate even in -
30c temperatures, I am looking forward 
to driving it long distance during the 
summer!"
pontiac,aztek,2002,kcstudmuffin, 05/19/2002,Absolutely love this vehicle!,4,"This is one of the best purchases I've 
ever made. The interior is 
exceptionally laid out and convenient. 
The ride is comfortable (my friends say 
it's like riding in a floating 
barcalounger!). Although I've had 
comments that it's ugly, I think it's 
fantastic and unusual (to each his 
own). I feel I got a great value for my 
money, and this is so much better than 
the SUV I traded in. I highly recommend 
it."
pontiac,aztek,2002,Hofmanms, 04/03/2009,My Aztec,4,I bought this used from a private seller. Within about 4 months the BCM quit while driving to a wedding 300 miles away. Luckily this only affected electronics and I was able to continue with little more than inconvenience. Had the BCM replaced by the dealer for about 500. I dont think the A/C ever worked but I hear its a 1000 dollar fix so I wont. Despite these problems I love the car. It can handle snow better than any car I have seen and I live in upstate NY so I see real snow. I get a lot of compliments and you cant beat the tent option with the cooler. Very Happy with the Aztec
pontiac,aztek,2002,Robert, 01/03/2008,So Far so good!,4,"I was searching for a family car just after our 2nd child, weighing heavily on utility.  We were going to be making a lot of long distance trips because my wife's family is from all over the USA.  Overall we have been delighted with the amount trunk space that is in this car.  Very happy with the comfort level when traveling over 2k miles one-way.  Love the leather with kids, and heated for mommy and I. Out west in states with higher speed limits we found the biggest weakness, not enough horsepower.  It'll hold 70 to 75 with no problem, try 80 even on the flat, in and out of overdrive.  So, we slowed down and maxed out the fuel milage 21 mpg could be better. Overall nice crossover!"
pontiac,aztek,2002,JT, 07/29/2007,Love This Truck,5,I cannot say enough good things about this vehicle. My wife normally doesn't care about a vehicle as long as it runs. She saw a used one at the dealership and loved it and she wouldn't look at anything else afterwards. Hard time finding them but we love it and wouldn't give it up. Gets better gas mileage then my 2003 Ford Taurus SES and both have a 6 cyclinder. Roomy and lots of comfort. Love the split seats and how easy the old up and / or come out completely. A lot easier then removing a bench seat from the mini van. Just can't say enough about this vehicle. Thought about getting a second one for me but don't want two of the same vehicle. Too bad Pontiac discountinued it. 
pontiac,aztek,2002,Bingo sun, 04/06/2002,Pontaic 2002 Aztek,4,"I love it. It has some ""fun"" styling 
which tends to scare most people from 
it. But after they got rid of the 
plastic cladding, this thing is a 
dream. I would recommend a 2002 Aztek 
to anyone who want a 4x4 to off-road."
pontiac,aztek,2002,diehard fan of aztek, 06/13/2002,I am constantly in love with Aztek,5,"I truly love the Aztek. I cannot speak 
highly enough of it because of limited 
space. It deserves the highest 
accolades because it is the best 
looking vehicle. The design and shape 
is fabulous: modern, space ship-like! 
The interior is comfy and all leather, 
I enjoy it immensely, however I 
wouldn't have bought the Aztek just for 
that. Basically all new cars are comfy 
inside. THE STYLE SETS IT APART AND 
MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE!"
pontiac,aztek,2002,CRC, 06/13/2002,AWESOME VEHICLE!,5,"Bought this car over the RAV4 (Boring, 
pricey) CR-V (what's up? No console! 
boring style).  Always owned Toyotas 
until now.  Probably the most 
versatile, option packed vehicle for 
the money.  Don't knock it 'till you've 
spent some time with it.  Ask any Aztek 
owner and they will tell you the same.  
Side airbags, V6, 4 wheel ABS, great 
stereo, cruise, full power for less 
than $22,000.  Very happy with the car."
pontiac,aztek,2002,darkback, 07/03/2002,Love This Thang,4,"I don't know why everyone keeps bagging 
on this truck.  It does everything I 
need, and more.  It also goes 
everywhere I need to go.  I camp, surf, 
mountain bike, snowboard, rollerblade, 
and work as a science teacher.  I need 
to haul a lot of crap around to a lot 
of places.  This truck gets me there 
with room and gas money to spare."
pontiac,aztek,2002,mayormcmisery, 07/07/2002,The Edsel Of The New Millenium,4,"Upon receiving my Aztek as a company 
vehicle, I was somewhat skeptical of 
its practicality and driveability, not 
to mention its looks. But after a 
couple hundred miles behind the wheel, 
my trusty Aztek does shine over other 
SUV's. Having carrying a huge cargo 
load everyday, the Aztek still handles 
nimbly, rides well, and swallows its 
cargo with vigor. The seats are 
extremely comfortable. This vehicle is 
punished daily (250 hard miles), and 
like an old dog, keeps coming back 
faithfully and reliably. I've actually 
come to really enjoy the Aztek and 
will heavily consider buying it once 
the lease is over. I foresee great 
realiability."
pontiac,aztek,2002,Kristy79, 07/12/2002,I love my vehicle!,4,"Buying this vehicle is the best

pulled a ski boats 300 miles w no 
probs. This is a comfortable vehicle 
for long trips. I carry my road bike 
and mountain bike inside the car all 
the time w ample room for other gear. 
Have used the camping package and love 
it. Once you drive it, you will be 
hooked. added a bike roof carrier bike 
rack w wind ferring to really enhance 
the look.  You can haul anything in 
this car."

purchase a year.  I have to say that of
all the cars we have owned, the Aztek
has quickly become my favorite.

Because of poorly delivered marketing,
it is possible to get great deals on one
of the best bargains available today in
the auto world."
pontiac,aztek,2002,MARKZ, 08/14/2002,A stand out among the ordinary,5,"We purchased this vehicle for around
$21,000. It stickered for $23,885. We
looked at the Rendezvous but to get the
same equipment we would have had to
spend nearly $4,000.00 more! The 0%
financing made it even more tempting. We
turned in our 2001 olds Alero early and
are still paying less to purchase this
vehicle than to lease the Alero! The
ride and handling are top notch and the
functionality of the interior is
wonderfull! My wife originally wanted a
minivan but after I talked her into the
Aztek (because it was $3,000 cheaper) we
now fight over the keys to the Aztek"
pontiac,aztek,2002,Ibhappy, 08/06/2004,Simply the best,4,"Did not like the looks at first in 
2001. But now I love it. It's 
different! Great vechicle with a great 
sound system. Perfect for the family 
with a cottage and you need that extra 
space but don't want a van. Drives 
great! My friends at first said it was 
ugly, and then when they had there 
first drive, they liked it. I could not 
be happier with my purchase. I hope 
they don't stop making them because I 
think they are catching on. No problem 
at 60000."

I've rented the Rendezvous,all the Isuzus, Fords, Chevy's and GMCs but the Aztec is my favorite for comfort and spaciouness.  My husband is 6'4"" and also says it's very comfortable.

pontiac,aztek,2002,Shannon1283, 04/19/2008,Not worth your money,4,"I first bought my AWD Sports Aztek because of 2 friends owning one. I took a ride in it and fell in love. 2 days later, I went and bought one. As ugly as it is, my Aztek is super sporty with a lot of features most don't have.  However, I have had nothing but problems with it (My 2 friends sold theirs a year later and later found out it was documented a ""lemon""). I have 72,000 miles on it right now.  I have replaced both front rotors twice, brakes twice, windshield always leaks,gas mileage is horrible.I fill up every 4 to 5 days (I only drive about 30 miles every day). Rear latch always sticks, tires wear out easily, now the car is shaking and a bad grinding noise which is affecting driving"
pontiac,aztek,2002,perryjd, 03/05/2002,I LOVE AZTEK,4,"I love it!  If you are one that likes its look, or grow to, you'll really enjoy Aztek.  It rides really well and if you dig interior features.... you'll be in heaven!  With the 1sb option package you get great features with little to no extra cost.  It is a stand alone and not a clone."

pontiac,aztek,2002,robob, 05/15/2002,The Tank,4,"I purchased this vehicle as a leftover 
2001 while I was looking for a 2003 
Vibe. I was able to get $3,000 in 
rebates and $3,160 off the list price. 
I took a trip to Daytona Beach, Florida 
last month and the comfort was 
excellent with an abundance of room for 
everything. As the owner of a Trans Am, 
I say it could use about 35 more 
horsepower but the mileage would 
suffer. The trip average was 22.1 mpg 
overall with a high of 25.2 on one tank 
with the speed kept below 65 mph. Start 
looking at 75 mph and that figure will 
drop to the high 22's. Again, if you 
can get someone in one the features 
will win them over."

reports.  Door that open too hard will 
not close again.  No fixes from Pontiac 
offered.  Completely happy with it if 
my passenger door would shut.  
Apparently the hinges mount to 
sheetmetal rather than body frame.  
Find one on a lot more than a couple of 
months old, and it will have a eskewed

that I know it is non appealing, but I 
said its like getting that pearl inside 
that shell. I love that the seats come 
out, my dogs (2 wiems) love all the 
room in it. I can't count how many 
times I could have used the tent in the 
past. The features are great, the ride 
is wonderful. I would have to say 
though the I would rather take this 
over a minivan anyday. because we have 
almost the same room. If you want a 
luxury SUV the Aztek is not for you. If 
you want a SUV to go skiing, hicking, 
camping, canoing, road trips, 
party/tailgatting vehicle.... get the 
aztek"
pontiac,aztek,2002,nick dalmation, 08/22/2002,we love it,4,"We love this car.  My son is a 13 year

It had lots of interior room, wonderful

We were'nt wild over the styling,but 
one test drive completely changed our 
minds. We traded in our 2000 v-8 awd 
Ford Explorer. We feel the awd Aztek is 
GM's hidden value.As its  price was 
much, much less than other suv's on the 
market. We dont do off road stuff and 
love the awd drive option on the Aztek. 
With the trailer towing package and 17 
inch wheels its a awsume find. And a 
great value for the money. It out 
performs our Explorer by far and the 
ride is smooth and dont beat you to 
death. We get double the gas mileage on 
the Aztek and thats real easy to get 
use to. Its versatile, comfortable, and 
fun to drive."

yellow puppy's first two months of life 
and it has given me nothing else but 
total satisfaction.  I've driven it in 
shorts and sandals, in jeans, in a 
tuxedo...  and it has behaved just 
peachy in every situation.  The driving 
is so comfortable and the AWD system 
seems to make a difference in the 
crooked, ponded Acapulco highway.  All 
my friends and relatives say that 
giving a try to my Aztek has definetly 
changed (for good) the original opinion 
they had about this SUVs."
pontiac,aztek,2002,badoogi, 09/06/2002,total dismay,3,"In 3 days after the purchase, it breaks 
down. The car would not start. The 
dealership did not respond quick 
enough. the 24hour assistance was just 
horrible. I was stranded on busy two - 
lane street (Ave of stars in Century 
city, L.A.). at 1 p.m. The service 
technician sent from the dealer arrived 
at the scene at 7:00 p.m. The guy did 
not even know where Century city was. 
To make it worse, he could not fix the 
problem. Then, I called the 24 hour 
road side assistance at 8;00 P.M. The 
towing truck driver arrived at 10:10 
P.M. It has been the worst day of life 
and this is all because of one stupid, 
crappy car."
pontiac,aztek,2002,Briandear, 09/11/2002,Tremendous Budget Buy,4,"I licked my chops over the 2003 Vibe, 
but then I was showed this 2001 
clearance model.  Once inside, the 
versatility and features won me over.  
Great for hauling my musical gear, and 
everyone asks me about it.  Smooth 
quiet ride, really sits and drives more 
luxuriously than its outdoorsy 
interior.  I couldn't find anything 
else in an SUV or wagon with leather 
seats, much less heated, for 23,000.  
Enough said. Also, Consumer Guide gives 
the FWD version the higher score, for 
better acceleration and ride."

I thought it was one of the ugliest 
vehicle I'd ever seen, when I first saw 
it, but now more than 2 years later I 
bought one. I took a look at the 
sticker, and on a dare, I test drove 
the Aztek. I loved the way it drove, 
and all the features it included. I 
couldn't pass up one of the best 
bargains on the market. 
I'm still not crazy about the style, 
(everyone else in my family loves it), 
but it is growing on me, and I really 
like the way it handles/drives. 
One problem --- everyone in my 
family wants to borrow it."
pontiac,aztek,2002,janices, 10/06/2002,We love it!!,5,"I bought the Aztek after a lot of research that I based on people who actually 
owned them...and now I know I definitely did the right thing.  
Oh and I don't care if other don't like it,,,,,they're not the one who drives 
it...and as long as I'm satisfied that's all that really counts!!
My 4 grandchildren who age from 2 to 11 just love to ride in it..and everyone 
who has ever ridden with me are pleasantly surprised...."
pontiac,aztek,2002,dmr, 04/30/2002,Give it a chance,4,"For a couple of years we looked for a 
vehicle that can carry large, bulky 
items, gets good gas mileage (25+ 
highway), is front wheel drive, and is 
comfortable for long trips (over 12 
hours/day).  These criteria eliminated 
the great majority of SUV's out there 
until the Aztek came along.  Against 
the advice of friends, we had a test 
drive and were more than pleasantly 
surprised by the ride, comfort and easy 
handling.  We bought one in Feb. and it 
keeps getting better the longer we own 
it.  Give one a chance!"
pontiac,aztek,2002,Stanko Brankovic, 12/18/2002,It makes difference,4,"I have Aztek AWD already 8 months. So 
far  its been a pleasure driving it and 
injoing it.  My  wife  did  not like it 
in  the begining  but  now  She is the 
Aztek's  biggest  fan. First  snow 
and drive through a messy Pittsburgh  
streets   was a real test. Vehicle  
is  well designed and built  for a  
harsh  winter conditions and so  far  
we made several long trips to Savana 
(GA), N. Orleans (LA), Toronto  (CA) 
not having any  problems.  Considering 
the pricee that we paid,(19600) (with 
17' wheels) this car is realy  best buy 
for its class.  I strongly  recmmend 
it for people that wnat to make a 
diference."
pontiac,aztek,2002,SueW, 02/09/2003,Mixed Bag,3,"I was singing its praises for the 
first few months of ownership, but now-
2,000 miles into ownership, on its 
first road trip-major 
problem.  A boot on the drive shaft 
broke and left me stranded for more 
than a week while the part had to be 
shipped from Detroit.  GM has no trip 
interrupt policy so they paid some 
but I was out $500 in expenses-plus 
the inconvenience.  The dealer said if 
the drive shaft would have dropped on 
the pavement at highway speed-we'd be 
dead!  A few other minor complaints-
the rear hatch struts are too weak for 
the heavy trunk.  The radio is 
possessed-stations will change, tracks 
will change, and the mode AM/FM/CD will
change."
pontiac,aztek,2002,Raven2wren, 07/11/2003,A total surprise inside and out,5,"We had driven and looked at dozens of 
cars and SUV's.  Nothing seemed to fit 
what we needed.  Having driven a Buick 
Park Avenue Ultra I was more than a 
little bit spoiled by the power and 
options I had become used to.  I had 
walked past the Aztek twice and never 
gave it a second look, but my husband 
stopped and looked inside.  He called 
me over and we went for a test drive 
and immediately knew that this was 
exactly what we needed at a price that 
we could afford!  It had all of the 
options that my Buick had, plus the fun 
sporty drive that is classic Pontiac.  "
pontiac,aztek,2002,Linzy, 07/30/2003,Awesome Car,4,"I bought my Aztek a year ago this 
month, and I absolutely made the right 
decision.  Considering the alternative 
cars, such as the Nissan Xterra, with 
a lower base price, but no comfort 
features to speak of, the Aztek is 
worth it, the most basic ones come 
with CD, power locks and windows, AC 
and heat, and so much more.  They are 
great for traveling, and having 
tailgate parties, and you wouldn't 
believe the room in the back!"
pontiac,aztek,2002,robier_a, 08/13/2003,Weird looking but cool to drive.,4,"I was impressed by the interior the 
most. Very roomy, & confortablle, 
especcially in the back seat. I like 
alot of space when I drive and even 
when I have my seat to where I want it 
there is still a bunch of room for the 
passenger in the back."
pontiac,aztek,2002,Imacarguy, 10/07/2003,Great......with qualifications,4,"Seating comfort is great, especially 
for someone with lumbar problems.  
Overall flexibility of this vehicle is 
phenomenol.  It's a real shame that GM 
didn't do a rear-end styling change 
(smooth it out, improve visibility and 
overall attractiveness) early-on.  I 
decided on buying a ""nearly-new"" '02 
instead of a '03 due to price/option 
considerations.  Guess I'll be 
considering a Rendevous in the 
future ?!!    "
pontiac,aztek,2002,wabartz, 10/17/2003,Love our Aztek,4,"It's easy to maneuver in parking lots,
handles well and is surprisingly peppy.
 The rear audio controls and slide out
storage bin are extremely useful.  The
stereo is great (get the 180W 10-speaker
system).  With the rear tie downs and
tailgate/hatch setup I am constantly
amazed at what I can haul with it (very
versatile).  This has been a great
replacement for our minivan and has been
servicing our family (2 adults and 3
kids) very well for the last year.  This
is the vehicle that brought me back to
domestic vehicles after years of buying
imports.  It has been reliable and fun
to drive, definitely a keeper."
pontiac,aztek,2002,karew70, 10/30/2003,Makes life Fun,5,"I bought my Aztek used and got a Great 
deal on it. I am the Mother of three 
boys 14,8,6. When it came time to get a 
new Vehicle my husband wanted me to get 
a car but with three boys a Van to a 
car NOWAY. At first I thought the Aztek 
was a bit strange looking but once I 
test drove it I KNEW it was for me. 
Makes me feel young again and still 
gives me the space I need. My boys 
think its the coolist Thing and thier 
friends all like it so I earned bonus 
points. hahaha"
pontiac,aztek,2002,Brad , 01/01/2006,Very competent not so cute AWD,4,"I purchased this car used with under 40K miles from a Ford dealer on e-bay. My  trip home averaged 27 mpg. I often drive the car to Northern Vermont, a six hour trip feeling refreshed and confident that the AWD will perform in snow as expected. With side airbags, ABS, fog lights, truly comfortable heated seats and an average mpg consistently in the low to mid twenties and a price below $12,000, this car offers good value. It is easy to find in parking lots bcause of its size and rarity. If the car had a more appealing exterior, I would probably own TWO.    "
pontiac,aztek,2002,mavisbean, 02/06/2004,Highly recommended!,5,"I absolutely LOVE this vehicle! It 
feels & drives like a much more 
expensive SUV. It's very roomy and 
comfortable and the passengers in the 
back have plenty of leg room."
pontiac,aztek,2002,bluewaves, 01/21/2006,White Aztec,4,"Replaced rear hatch shocks, brake safety switch, front passenger side wheel axle, thermostat, rear defrost doesn't work and hatch is hard to close.  Fixing things costs a lot of money because you have to go to a dealer.  I was better off trading it."
pontiac,aztek,2002,dogd923, 03/13/2006,So UGLY-it's CUTE,4,"Just bought this '02 Aztek,and I love it.The dealer gave me a great deal on it, since he thought it was so ugly, he didn't want it on his lot. It is roomy, and very easy to drive. Plenty of cargo/storage area, and the rear seats lift out like a mini-van.This is very helpful for moving large objects, or transporting a huge dog, as I do.A very versatile, and unusual vehicle. The AWD version (which I own) gives you the SUV you need-I live in CT-plus minivan type room-all wrapped up in a unique package."
pontiac,aztek,2002,Pami1968, 03/02/2004,Luv the Aztek,4,"The moment I hopped in the car for the 
test drive, I knew it was mine.  I feel 
such joy driving it.  Drives smooth - 
the V6 engine has lots of pick up.  
Never had a thing go wrong with the car 
in two years.  Yeah, some people think 
it looks weird, but once you drive it, 
you will be a convert!  "
pontiac,aztek,2002,DennyMo, 03/16/2004,"Mostly Good, Just A Couple Quibbles",4,"Two kids in car seats, a 5'4"" mom and a 
6'3"" dad: definitely a challenge to 
find an affordable vehicle that we all 
would fit into.  Full-size 
sedan/wagon?  Getting car seats in and 
out of a car is a contortionist's 
exercise.  Minivan?  Blah.  Full-size 
SUV?  Too big, too expensive.  The 
Aztek is the best, almost perfect, 
fit.  Only regrets: we wish we'd gotten 
the power seats and CD changer."

in 31k miles."
pontiac,aztek,2002,twiglet, 04/16/2004,Love my Aztek,5,"This car is can do everything.  What I 
really enjoy is the comfort, This has 
to be one of the most comfortable 
small to midsize SUV's on the market.  
I love that it does look different, it 
is not one of those cookie cutter 
designs,it stands out.  Some people 
say ugly, I say just different, and 
alot of people agree me!"

Mustang. Wonderful, forward thinking 
design,not a cookie cutter SUV.Turns 
heads!!Better gas mileage than 
otherSUV.Great sound system,cold 
air,lights everywhere!! Rides way 
smooth and quiet.Do not overlook the 
Aztek for an attention getter.My 
daughter(22)is thinking of trading her 
Grand Am for one,it is so 
sweet.Oh,with sunroof tho.You will not

the preformance and versatility of our 
vehicle.  Had a playstation 2 put in.  
Highly recommended!!  Great vehicle for 
those who want a SUV for the price of a 
mid-size car!!!!  The rear seats are 
great!!!  "

upset about the gas cap I wish they

also have a problem with the trunk

not able to fix it. "
pontiac,aztek,2002,randtauwers, 08/23/2004,"Quirky, but a great vehicle",5,"Some people don't like the styling, but 
we love it even though it is a little 
quirky.  Styling aside, this is a great 
vehicle.  It is practical, comfortable, 
lots of room to haul stuff around.  The 
mileage is better than most any other 
SUV.  We have the bright Aztek yellow 
and it is great because you can easily 
find it in the parking lot.  It easily 
tows our 19 foot I/O boat with no 
trouble at all."
pontiac,aztek,2002,tjhbama, 11/02/2004,Dependable Alternative,4,"I traded my Suburban for my Aztek.  
Best economics trade ever... I have 52K 
miles on my 2002, and have had no 
mechanical problems, and get 20/25 city 
and highway.  Don't have the space of 
the suburban (9 passengers), but have 
room for 5 adults and luggage for 
same.  I tow a 8' utility trailer for 
recreation, and love the flexibility of 
flipping rear seats down, or up, or 
taking them out easily.  Cargo space is 
nice in the rear, with 48"" width for 
hauling lumber for those home 
improvement projects.  Drivers seat 
cover replaced under warranty last year."
pontiac,aztek,2002,Aztek Happy, 11/23/2004,Aztek: The car people love to hate,4,I bought the Aztek because of all of the great things it can do. It is the best car I have ever owned (I am 60 so I have owned a bunch). It does everything and is the most comfortable car I have ever owned. We went 14k miles last summer and never had any comfort problems. Get past the looks and buy one. You will really love it. You can get a good deal on one and shop around for the bells and whistles. 
pontiac,aztek,2002,nah1978, 04/01/2005,a few problems but I'd buy it again,4,"I bought my 2002 AWD used with 25k and it is now up to almost 60k.  Just a warning, be prepared to replace both the front wheel bearings at some point.  I have done some research on the internet and this seems to be about the most common major problem with the vehicle.  I was just out of warranty and it cost me about 400 bucks to do both.  Even so I love this vehicle.  You can get a good deal on them since some people don't like the looks.  I just tinted all the windows and put a grill guard on and it looks awesome.  It handles great, good MPG for an SUV (lower to mid 20's), plenty of room, good for hauling people or just flip the seats up and you can haul a ton of cargo."
pontiac,aztek,2002,wayne stanton, 04/02/2005,fun and functional,4,"We have owned our Pontiac Aztek for a month now. After looking at several different models we chose this one due to price and initial impressions, with both room and comfort in mind. This car has proven to be a great choice, it is so quiet inside the cabin, and both very roomy and comfortable. I find its exterior looks to be very appealing, and the ride is both smooth and responsive. I think we have made an excellent choice. I am sorry they won't be making this car anymore after this year though, I do recommend it very strongly."
pontiac,aztek,2002,GJB, 04/03/2005,Great Value,4,"starting to use oil and the heater fan is a little load on high. Other than that, it has been a great car. "
pontiac,aztek,2002,NEBTEK2002, 11/13/2005,"Unique, Reliable,Affordable",5,"My wife and I loved the concept car and wanted the production model from Day 1.  We test drove a 2001 GT,loved that one but resisted it until we could travel 30 mi. to see this ""basic"" 2002 with fewer miles and a lower pricetag.  With Azteks, basic doesn't mean stripped. We don't have ONstar, dual A/C controls, power seats; but we do have most everything else.  We used to be Chrysler minivan owners. This one is has a tighter body than any of the 3 Chrysler products we've owned.  It rides better than the standard Caravan, handles better, and the transmission has none of the Chrysler ""hunting"" tendencies on long upgrades.  Other than replacing a ruined tire, no repairs at all thus far."
pontiac,aztek,2002,Dave Barber, 03/18/2003,NOT an ugly ducking...,4,"Sure, it's easy to bash Pontiac for 
what most consider to be ugly, weird, 
or bizarre styling.  But it grows on 
you, and after owning one for nearly a 
year, I have concluded it is on of the 
best values out there.  We've had NO 
mechanical problems, there are no 
rattles or squeaks and it tows our 
camper (equipped with towing package) 
with ease."
pontiac,aztek,2002,gramhar73, 05/29/2006,Love my Aztek,4,"Didn't like this car at first glance, but glad i gave the inside a look.  The drive is smooth and the interior is beyond spacious.  The back seat can comfortably hold 2 car seats and a large adult - and there is plenty of room for EVERYTHING that you need to bring."
pontiac,aztek,2002,Krovas, 03/02/2008,Off the Beaten Path.,4,"Have had my '02 Aztek for a few months. Purchased at 54k for $8000 even. A few initial repair issues (wheel hubs/bearings) that the dealer took care of. Decent mileage overall for a vehicle of this kind, but truly excellent on the highway. Possibly the most comfortable SUV ever made; a four hour drive feels like a ten minute trip to the supermarket. Interior design more than makes up for funky exterior styling. Somewhat irritating hatch release mechanism. Sufficient power for itself, but I probably wouldn't try towing anything with it. AWD performance is terrific. Overall, it's looks aren't the Aztek's only eccentricity, but I'll bet you'll forget all about them if you drive one."
pontiac,aztek,2002,mike, 08/01/2007,Better than you think,4,"I bouth this car in '04. Used to sell them, and I was always a fan. Killer motor after you replace the head and intake gaskets(warranty) Front wheel bearings after 90k. Otherwise, it's been a great car.  22-28 mpg with a K and N filter and has good power. Tons of room and a killer interior. Rear seats fold up or pull out, and even recline. The console cooler is the best! So is the stereo!  Have 115k on it now and it runs perfect! Understeers in snow, but once you learn to drive it, it will go most anywhere with good tires. Buy this car used and it will not let you down."
pontiac,aztek,2002,krystl, 05/15/2003,Don't Judge A Book by The Cover,4,"Many people do not like the Aztek 
based on its looks. If they would look 
past that, they would find a quality 
vehicle, with lots of comfort and 
functionality at a reasonable price.
I wish Pontiac would advertise the 
Aztek more because there are a lot of 
consumers out there that are missing 
out on a fabulous car!
I am so glad I bought mine. It's very 
comfortable for my family of 4. It 
holds everything I need it to and the 
kids have plenty of room. The Aztek is 
roomier than its counterparts (RAV4 
and CRV).
Check out the Aztek. Youu won't be 
disappointed."
pontiac,aztek,2002,Don.Descy, 02/20/2003,Love the Aztek,5,"We bought the Aztek because we wanted the 
camper option... yes, we wondered about 
the style. But after driving it for a few 
weeks we are totally in love with it. It 
does everything and it is comfortable and 
roomy. We have the All Wheel Drive model. 
My wife drove back from Minneapolis in a 
blizzard last week and it held the road 
like a magnet. The is a Fun car and #1 in 
versitility!"
pontiac,aztek,2002,Form483, 05/21/2003,Love my Aztek,5,"As you can tell from my mileage I live 
in my Aztek.  I drive 160 miles round 
trip every day for work.  Due to an 
auto accident I have herniated disks in 
my back, my last car, a small truck, 
caused me great amounts of pain.  The 
drive in my Aztek has not caused me any 
pain.

I have not had to take my Aztek into 
the shop for anything but general 
maintenance such as oil changes.  I can 
not say that of the last vehicle I 
owned, a Ford Ranger.  The seats are 
easy to remove AND replace.  The cargo 
tray and nets keep things from sliding 
around in the back and the extra power 
source is great for parades and 
sporting events."

2001 Pontiac Aztek.  It has been driven

pontiac,aztek,2002,76corey, 03/13/2002,Greatest SUV sold!,5,"If you like to get a more for your money than you can't beat the Pontiac Aztek. Just do a comparison between any other SUV in it's class and you'll see that it has more cargo room, more payload capacity, better gas mileage, more comfortable, quieter, more car-like, more room, and on top of all that it's one of the most inexpensive. Now is a really good time to check the Aztek out, the rebates and incentives make this one awesome deal!"
pontiac,aztek,2002,KvB, 03/15/2002,Why I decided to buy an Aztek,4,"I test drove every SUV (foreign and domestic) in the up to $30,000 price range and NOTHING compared to the Aztek for comfort and the quiet ride.  The combination of its extremely odd looks and the fact that I have never owned a domestic-made car made me quite leary of purchasing the vehicle.  I kept going back and re-test driving the foreign models, but as there was really no comparison for comfort and ride, I took the plunge and bought the Aztek.  If something happened to my Aztek today, I would rush right out to buy another one.  It is such a pleasure to drive!"
pontiac,aztek,2002,boowanna, 03/17/2002,Boowanna's Black Aztec,5,Great vehicle!
pontiac,aztek,2002,mcml, 03/19/2002,Just Lovin It,4,"Actually I have a 2001 Aztec. But these same comments still apply to the 2002 model.
Very smooth highway ride.
Handling is very good for an SUV type vehicle.
Large amount of cargo space.
The strong low end torque on this vehicle is very apparent when climbing hills.
Very good fit and finish to this car. I have not had one problem with it.

The large amount of plastic trim actually complements the Pewter exterior color of this car very nicely.
Of course the Aztec generates a lot of stares, but most comments about it have been very positive,
especially once they have seen the interior."
pontiac,aztek,2002,Yellow Aztek owner, 03/25/2002,The swiss army knife of SUVs,5,"I've tried a little of everything in my Aztek... the AWD is really slick, and really keeps the car moving in the snow.  The camping package now includes a sun canopy, and the aztek handles great on the curvey roads. The console/cooler is great because i can use it everyday for work.  The styling with the 17"" wheels is now outstanding, and it's fun to have other aztek drivers honk and wave at you.    There is plenty of room to swallow luggage, and the sliding cargo tray makes other SUV owners jealous.  If you get Onstar you can call your friends on the road and tell them how much fun you're having!  My Aztek has felt very solid over bumpy roads."
pontiac,aztek,2002,simpleaztek, 04/08/2008,Garbage In Garbage Out,2,"Words of Wisdom - once the Aztek is over 3 years old or 50,000 miles it will deteriorate into a money pit.  We absolutely loved ours until about eight months ago.  Front passenger wheel bearing went, then the intake manifold leaked (yes, I know about the DexCool settlement) and then we had a cracked head gasket.  Over $3k into the car in the past six months and its only 5 1/2 years old and with only 60,000 miles on it.  Here I come Honda!  Never a GM car again for me."

pontiac,aztek,2003,Jordan, 11/06/2016,This car is a Champ!,4,"I was a Junior in high school when I got this car last year. My parents bought this car off a friend they knew well. At first, I hated it outright. Since I live in a rural community, I was expecting a truck of some sort, or, what I have always wanted, a sports car (Camaro, Mustang, ect.). But I have to say, since I brought it home, It grew on me. Don't get me wrong, this car is no sports car by ANY means, but this has over 265,000 miles with the original engine!! After 14 years of families, work, and now high school students, this car has survived every test that has been thrown at it! It maybe considered the worst car ever made and you may turn a few heads (not in a good way), but the folks up at GM and Pontiac meant what they said when they said it is ""Quite possibly the most versatile vehicle on the planet"". When car shopping, don't let its looks turn you away. Look underneath the plastic cladding and see how well it will fulfill your every need. They are also very cheap, so basically it's a steal! Get behind the wheel of an Aztek and I hope you will see what I mean.

I wish they still made them,I'd get another but all wheel drive...even though the 2WD was great in the snowy icy,and wet conditions."
pontiac,aztek,2003,Robert Surprenant, 07/13/2006,One great deal......,4,"Bought my used '03 Aztec a month ago. Previous owner spent $24,500 new. I spent $9,700 with all the ""bells and whistles""(power sunroof/moonroof, yeah!!) and only 49,000 miles on it! I can't believe how great it drives. I've owned over eight vehicles in the past twenty four years, and this is the nicest ride I've had. Test drove other mid SUV's, no comparison. Most drive like trucks, are to small in the cabin, seats stink and all look similar, boring. Aztec's have got to be the best deal in ""autoworld"" right now. People complain about the spoiler blocking their view,I love it, no more headlights in the eyes.I have no problem backing up. If you're thinking about an Aztec, go for it, it's a blast"
pontiac,aztek,2003,yolonda hunter, 04/14/2010,Unhappy customer,3,"I purchased this Aztec not even 3mos. Ago and I'm having problems with the brakes, wheel bearings, headlight shift gear ac unit. I was told that the SUV went through to inspection and that everything was working fine that's not true these cars can be a good car if you can repair it yourself because it's a costly vehicle to have so I don't recommend this one at all know. Wonder they stopped making them in 2005 because the only thing they offer is space don't buy if you use this vehicle as an every day car please."
pontiac,aztek,2003,borych, 07/17/2010,Excellent value,4,Have had car for 7 years now and have been more than satisfied. Recently had a few significant repairs. Over all am quite happy with the purchase. Runs well.  Good gas mileage 18-24 mpg for a 6 cyl AWD model. Excellent in deep snow! This car lives in New England outside and has served well.  Only minor cosmetic drawback is that it does not come with gas cover. Many people over the years have asked what happened to it. I keep needing to explained that this is the way it was designed. If they still made them I would buy a new one.
pontiac,aztek,2003,Tommy N Daniel, 08/17/2010,I Love It,5,"i love my aztek my baby bought it for me 2 years ago and the only thing we have had to do is change the oil, put a set of tires on it and new brakes all i can say is that its not ever left me standing out in the cold/heat and that i love it lol"
pontiac,aztek,2003,pilotauto, 02/19/2014,"380,000 KM and Passing it down.",5,"I purchased my 2003 Aztek new in the spring of 2003..I guess I,m one of the weirdos that like the styling..that is what attracted me to this vehicle,when I test drove it and saw all the cool little features,and how much room it had..well it spoke to me,so I bought it and,and have ""0"" regrets in fact it is without a doubt the best vehicle I have owned At 320,000KM I did have to have the intake manifold gasket replaced....but at 380.000KM she runs like a top.I oil sprayed(undercoated her from new,and every year after,and used 5W-30 Full synthetic Motor oil from Day 1 now my daughter is going to have it
I only hope the new vehicle I purchased gives me the worry free long service the Aztek has."
pontiac,aztek,2003,Angela, 03/29/2009,"Beautiful, but flawed",4,"Beautiful SUV, classy and elegant in black. Bought @ under 7,000 mi. Had to replace passenger wheel baring @ 40k mi. Replace driver wheel baring @ 50k mi. Now must replace again 4 months later. Need to replace brakes too often. Leaks coolant. Doors don't always unlock. Locking doesn't always ""beep"". Rear hatch doesn't release without helping hand. Settings 1 & 2 on AC/heat don't work. At a stop it will ""jump"" forward for no reason nearly bumping car in front of me. Rolls forward after putting in park. Hard to find parts outside of dealership. All common problems according to other sites. I'm so sad b/c I love this car so much. I want to keep it forever, but may have to trade someday soon."
pontiac,aztek,2003,Lesterd, 09/29/2009,Best choice yet!,4,"We HAD to replace a car.  It had over 300,000 miles on it, so we get an Aztec.  It has the a cd player and the basic 6 speaker sound system, and air conditioner, and ABS.  Everything else is standard.  I also just recently received my permit, I have had if for 5 months.  It has been an awesome driver, I love it.  It is pretty darn powerful for a V-6.  I hit 95 passing a truck just plain flooring it.  And the standard sound system is so amazing.  I put it on full blast playing the song ""My Michelle"" by the Guns n' Roses and I could hear it during road construction 2 blocks away.  We also just had to replace the oxygen sensor, and now it is a beast.  It is way louder and way faster Recomend it"
pontiac,aztek,2003,Bruce , 07/17/2010,Wonderful Experience,4,"Probably the best car I have ever owned!  You sit up high, killer sound system and best of all the Heads Up Display on the windshield (no tickets ever). 140,000 miles and have only had to replace some front and rear bulbs. I can take out the back seats and fit in full 4X8 sheets of plywood and close the hatch.  I have a hitch and I pull my 2 carrier motorcycle trailer loaded with ease.  I've had people out in public tell me my car is ugly, but I always liked the futuristic styling, reminds me of a vehicle from the movie Bladerunners.  Wish I could get a new one! Sorry the Pontiac brand is now gone!"
pontiac,aztek,2003,steph, 09/30/2002,The ugly duckling,4,"My husband and I read many reviews of 
the Aztec.  When we went to test drive 
one ourselves, we were blown away.  
Great car, fun to drive, plenty of room 
for a 8 year old, 90 lb. dog and all 
our stuff.  People hate the way it 
looks, but we love it.  Atleast it's 
not a cookie cutter car that looks like 
every other one out there on the road.  
We bought the car loaded with every 
feature you could imagine and are 
always getting compliments from people 
who we show it to.. Go take a test 
drive.  you'll fall in love with this 
car too................"

pontiac,aztek,2003,janis, 11/21/2005,glad i bought it,4,we purchased this vechicle   for traveling  reasons.. i love interior..its roomier(3 adult  children  fit in the back  seat) then it looks....the sun roof comes in handy on those  spring  sunny days .........i'll hate to get rid of it  when we have  too
pontiac,aztek,2003,newe82, 01/13/2006,Great car!!!,5,"Bought this vehicle late in 2003 and have never had any problems.  I love the space and the way that it handles. I bought it in white and I really like the way that it looks.  I wish they would keep making them, but I will buy another Pontiac for my next vehicle."
pontiac,aztek,2003,Kdavis324, 05/16/2003,Screw the Critics,5,"The Aztek is the best SUV on the 
market, I drive from SC to NY 2000 
miles round trip, at least 3 times a 
year with my family and the comfort in 
this SUV is un-comparable to any 
other.  The cargo space allows for 3 
suite cases and a cooler without 
impeding the visibility.  Gas mileage 
is about 30 highway and 22 city.  The 
Sound system is perfect and this thing 
is built to last for years.  To every 
critic who has slammed our beloved 
Aztek, shame on you for being just 
another cow in the heard....  One last 
thought, if the Aztek is so unappealing 
to the eye, why are there so many copy-
cats out there."
pontiac,aztek,2003,Jordan, 09/21/2016,Amazing car!!!,5,"I bought my 2003 Aztek in 2010. At the time it had around 60000 miles on it. Now (2016) I still have the car and the mileage is at 170000. This car has been absolutely amazing. I bought it in high school and it was my very first car and I haven't gotten rid of it because I absolutely love how reliable it is. VERY good in the snow (I live in Nebraska). Great value for the price. Also, for an suv it has great gas milage. Only bad thing is that the seats have a weird leaf pattern that I am not fond of but not all models have it and if they do you can buy seat covers.

pontiac,aztek,2003,Ombray, 12/03/2010,Blower Failures,3,Our heater blowers keep failing.  we are about to get our 6th.  We don't use it much in summer and don't run it on hi very often.  anyone else heard about this? 
pontiac,aztek,2003,Derek, 11/18/2008,Aztek,1,"Do not buy! I bought this vehicle a year ago and have had nothing but trouble with it. So far I've had to replace the intake gasket ($1000) head gasket ($1500), heater core ($500) and shifter ($500). I bought this vehicle at a reputable dealership thinking it would be OK, boy was I wrong. So far the tally has come to $3500 in repairs and of course the warranty covered nothing at all. Every review I read at the time said it was a great vehicle. It is anything but a great vehicle. Your better off getting something else"
pontiac,aztek,2003,Jackie's Aztek, 08/10/2002,Exterior looks aren't everything,4,"The Pontiac Aztek has been known for 
having a different/odd, not so popular 
exterior. When I purchased my own I got 
mixed opinions, ranging from hitious to 
groovy. I was able to persuade each and 
every non-Aztek believe by showing them 
the awesome interior (I choose the 
loaded ISD package). Not only is the 
interior everything I was looking for, 
it was 10,000 dollars cheaper than a 
Buick rendevous or Chevy Traliblazer 
with loaded options. It rides great 
too. I absoultley love it!"
pontiac,aztek,2003,H, 09/15/2008,A lot bang for the buck,4,"I bought my Aztek new in 2003.  I drive a lot of highway so I wanted a few more comfort options and I wanted a vehicle that would sit up higher and have more room without getting a truck or a minivan.  The car has been great with 2 large dogs and our child.  It rides comfy and even though I thought these cars were so ugly when they came out, I actually like the look now.  The car has been very reliable. I have read that consumer reports says to avoid them yet I have had few problems.  The oil changes were always on time, I replaced the front brakes and bearings and had the 100,000 mile flushes done.   At 113,000 miles the car is still riding as good as when it was new."
pontiac,aztek,2003,Big Deek, 09/24/2002,Ooooooogly!!!!,2,"This car is immensely hideous! I don't 
know how my wife got conned into buying 
this piece. The fuel pump is loud, the 
AC is annoyingly LOUDER and the 
reliability is in a league of it's own: 
awful. This is an expensive mistake!!! 
Don't waste your money! Typical GM 
quality, er, junk. Buy a FourRunner. 
Foreign cars are so much better made 
and ten times better looking than this!"
pontiac,aztek,2003,Mjh, 11/03/2002,Try It,4,"If you want a cookie cutter run of the 
mill SUV buy a Ford, Chevy, Mazda, 
Honda, etc,etc.  If you want something 
different, that does everything well, 
then buy an Aztek.  We've had ours 
about 3 weeks and are completely 
satisfied with it.  The more we drive 
it the more we like.  For the price, 
features, and all around vehicle 
satifaction, give the Aztek a try."
pontiac,aztek,2003,buddyrtr, 03/24/2004,A Surprise To Me,5,"As a diehard pickup driver, I'm still 
surprised that I bought an Aztek, but 
I've never regretted the choice. This 
is the most versatile vehicle I've 
ever owned. I can haul a load of 
paneling, take my wife out to dinner, 
and go camping with the grandkids at 
the lake - all in the same vehicle. 
I've driven it over 31K miles in 17 
months and I still love the comfort, 
the great handling, the peppy 
performance, and the great gas mileage 
(I average about 23mpg in town and 
29mpg on the highway). "
pontiac,aztek,2003,Charlie, 02/17/2007,Incredible and underappreciated,4,"Owning this vehicle has been a true joy.  Its spacious interior has been very convenient, and folding middle seats function better then any other vehicle in its class for my needs.  It's got the spacious function of a mini-van, without having the larger size.  I also used the Aztek tent combo with it, and whilst I was moderately unimpressed by the tents ability to keep water out, I really loved the mattress and how perfectly it fit into the back.  I took this vehicle on a 3500 mile road trip without a single problem.  Love the way it feels to drive - very comfortable.  It has good pickup, and sufficient torque for its class.  A great experience owning it."
pontiac,aztek,2003,garthodinson, 05/16/2003,Why I Love the Aztek,4,"My wife has a bad back and had a hard 
time with other cars we tested. She 
loves the seating and since we've 
gotten it takes it on long rides, 
leaving me with the Firebird:( 

It has performed wonderfully in the 
snow and it is a great vehicle on 
trips. We also love camping in it.

When my wife's lease on the Firebird 
is up she plans on getting an Aztek 
also!"

This is a GREAT car. Plenty of room!! Great for trips.  I have the leather seats, 6 cd changer, moon roof etc.  FABULOUS car!  I would buy one all over again! I can ONLY say good things about this vehicle.  I really do like ALL the room withour it being a huge SUV.  If you have an opportunity to buy one, go ahead - do it without hesitation. This car has been extremely reliable!!  Mine is not a 4 wheel drive but it handles great in the snow. GREAT car!!"
pontiac,aztek,2003,Steve, 08/08/2010,Ugly But Functional,3,"Surprisingly impressed! First American car in 30 years, and it's really nice!  No complaints, except for having great difficulty putting gas into it.  Have had diagnosis by 3 certified mechanics, replaced fuel vapor canister, fuel evap solenoid and STILL have to put gas in at about 5 cents a spurt because the nozzle keeps kicking out.  It's smooth, quiet, powerful and has a number of features I was going to invent one of these days.  I recommend a buy, if you're more concerned about function than appearance."
pontiac,aztek,2003,Geoffrey, 08/26/2002,Give it a chance,4,"My father drives a Sante Fe, and I 
drive a VW GTI (Golf).  We rented an 
Aztec this past weekend for some major 
moving.  Wow, this was a great car.  
The inside is amazing.  It could have 
held our entire load.  It is a very 
practicle car, much like my Golf.  Form 
follows function.  The inside was made 
with nice materials, the ride was very 
smooth.  Every aspect of the Aztec blew 
the Sante Fe away.  If you are looking 
for an ""SUV"" and want to spend around 
20k, I would suggest giving the Aztec a 
test drive.  Driving is believing 
should be the Aztec's moto, not 
Hyundai.  Because anyone who had driven 
a Hyundai then believes what they did 
before, their junk."
pontiac,aztek,2003,Cars4me89, 08/29/2002,Pontiac Aztek,3," Almost everybody I encounter ask me 
why did you by such an ugly car? I now 
realize how ugly it really is. The 
design for the money doesn't balance. I 
could under stand the styling if the 
car was like $19,000 or so. But it 
isn't very good value."

met on the road Pontiac Aztek : ""wow,
look this what the car"" said my wife,
""wow"" I said, ""wow"" said my son. We ware
so fascinated so I follow Aztek for a
while until we found it was Pontiac. 
Now we have it and we love it.
I don't understand critics and the
people who can say is awkward or ugly.
No, it is very nice car, just different.
Look at streets all cars are about same
, Aztek is different."

Incomparison with my 97 Explorer.  It 
has a better ride, better gas milage, 
just as much room with the rear seats 
in and more room than the Explore with 
the rear seats out. And the price with 
the same options was thousands cheaper."

and found this mid-sized SUV to be the 
best value for quality. Most SUVs 
including compact SUVs came in at a 
higher cost with less to offer. Unlike 
many other SUVs this drives very 
smooth and has sure footing. My 
package included a power sunroof, 
power windows, keyless entry, V-6 and 
a BEAUTIFUL, SPACIOUS, Practical,

several people already compliment it's

fabulous.  Has more interior room than 
one may expect.  With the rear seats 
removed and the removable tray removed, 
the amount of hauling space is wonderfu.
Rear sight lines with spoiler on the

I was looking for car with some 
ameneties for around $20,000.  What we 
found was a car with a sense of 
humor.  From the take it along 
cooler/console to the sliding storage 
unit to the removable seats.  Plus, it 
was a good drive.  It impressed him 
enough that it is the car I ended up 
with after test driving a Ford Escape, 
an Isuzu Rodeo, a Saturn Vue and a 
Hyandia Santa Fe.  I can store my

a while, great interior, fuel milage is 
adequate for a SUV of this size.  My 
only problem is the constant down 
shifts when driving in moderately hilly 
terrain or into the wind.  It seems to 
hate staying in overdrive.  The 
dealership has been very cooperative in 
trying to fix the problem but it is a 
desine flaw.  The engine does not have

PS, PB, Auto, RWD, with none of the ""un-
needed"" extras.  She likes the 
versatility, fuel economy and handling, 
and the fact she sits higher up.  

We got it on sale for $16,900 at a 
promo on memorial day and got the 
luggage rack, and cruise control for 
free.  
I find it rides confortable, is one of 
the quietest vehicles I have rode in,

enthusiast and I get a kick out of the 
Aztek.  Sure, it looks odd to some but 
that's what I like...it doesn't look 
like everything else out there (easy 
to find in a crowded parking lot).  If 
you don't agree go along in your bland 
Camry or Accord or cookie-cutter SUV.  
It is the most comfortable vehicle I 
have ever driven.  At the time of 
purchase, it was the most powerful 
engine in its class.  I went from FL 
to NH twice and I am still surprised 
by the comfortable...really luxurious 
ride that I am treated to.  You simply

huge huge difference.The aztek rides 
much much quieter and softer down the 
road I could not believe the difference 
it also corners better and feels more 
stable on the highway.The tek also has 
features on it the crv can only dream 
of."
pontiac,aztek,2003,Coach L, 08/04/2003,On the Road with Aztec,4,"Last month, I drove the Aztec from New 
Orleans to St. Louis with no long 
stops, and I got out of the vehicle 
without any stiffness.  No comfort 
concerns.  At 24-28 mpg on the highway, 
no problems there either. Performance?  
Responsive and smooth, but I wish it 
sat just a little higher for speed 
bumps and uneven driveways. Climate 
control and stereo sound are excellent, 
and it's fun to see people staring at 
the vehicle at stop lights.  The 
unusual styling is an attention-getter, 
and my high school students love it. My 
only complaint about the interior is 
that for some reason, some of the 
seating areas seem to be wearing rather 
quickly."
pontiac,aztek,2003,siucgirl, 08/14/2003,Stop critizing this great car!,5,"I bought this great SUV just this 
month, but I am sure I will be in love 
with it for awhile.  I love the design, 
although many critics are out there, 
even my fiance.  He kept going on and 
on about how ugly it was, but when he 
got in for the test drive he totally 
changed his tune.  Now we both love 
driving it and it is more like a fight 
to see who gets to drive.  It's roomy, 
comfy, and the ride is very smooth, 
something you won't find in other SUV 
since they are built on truck frames, 
and the Aztek is built on a mini-van 
frame."
pontiac,aztek,2003,kaysoc, 09/02/2003,Interesting vehicle,5,"This is so unusual that some think it 
is cute and others ugly.  I know it 
works for me.  I am short, so I love 
the slightly higher viewpoint.  We had 
some nasty weather and the Aztec was 
smooth and controllable even in the 
worst weather.
It is easy to load and we have gotten a 
full sized matress in the back--and 
were able to close the hatch."
pontiac,aztek,2003,wf, 09/07/2003,"Just the facts, Ma'am",5,"Been an Aztek admirer since inception, 
but waited for refinements. If you 
don't need third row seating, more than 
3500 lbs tow, traditional SUV badge, 
ordinary horsepower (much more than 
sufficient for my needs), and normal 
ground clearance, this is for you.  
Throw in decent mpg, great build 
quality and radio, HVAC, and reclining 
rear removable seats, and the Aztek's 
perfect. Pet peeves: Rides a little 
floaty, though I do push it when 
rounding a corner with good feedback; 
wish the exterior door handles were 
like the Vibe's. Is owning living up to 
the wanting? YES!! Overall, a pleasure 
to own and drive, with decent insurance 
premiums.  "
pontiac,aztek,2003,RandyG, 07/19/2003,Zero Buyers Remorse on This One!,5,"I struggled for a long time trying to 
decide which SUV to buy. The test drive 
set the Aztek above all. I hear 
complaints about the looks, I think 
it's very good looking. So it's not 
conventional. Not everyone wants to be 
plain and conventional. It's edgy, and 
its for people who don't care to 
necessarily and boringly blend in. 
Inside, that's what sold me. The test 
drive. The handling is superb, the 
comfort is unmatched in its class and 
the ride was smoother than I expected. 
I wanted to run my old car over a cliff 
after I drove the Aztek. For the first 
time ever, I have no buyer's remorse. 
The Aztek rocks hard. It's the unsung 
hero of automobiles."
pontiac,aztek,2003,TREETOP106, 09/19/2003,2003 PONTIAC AZTEK,4,"WE JUST RECENTLY BOUGHT OUR NEW AZTEK

pontiac,aztek,2003,keg627, 09/19/2003,i love my ugly suv,4,"We just bought our Aztec in June, and 
we had looked at the buick rendevous. 
After driving the Buick, and getting 
into the Aztec, there was no question 
in my mind.  I LOVED IT..my husband I 
thought would hate it, the looks 
anyways. He felt the same way. So, 
don't knock it til you try it. It is 
wonderful..roomy,fun to drive, 
versatile, the interior is awesome. 
COming from a former minivan driver, 
this is as sporty as a mom of two can 
get. I love it."
pontiac,aztek,2003,FB, 09/29/2003,Best Purchase Decision Since Last Car,5,"I picked it up at almost 
7K below MSRP (actually a healthy 
amount below invoice) and I don't think 
anyone can find a better deal on 
a ""better car"" anywhere.  The MPG is 
acceptable considering the weight of 
the vehicle and the fact that it has 
AWD, so no complaints there.  I put 
almost 300 miles on it the first day I 
had it, and if I wasn't so tired, I'd 
have probably driven it more that day.  
It's more fun with every turn of the 
ignition key.  I highly recommend that 
anyone in the market for a SUV/SRV take 
a test drive in an Aztek.  You won't be 
disappointed."
pontiac,aztek,2003,Chad, 01/13/2005,Can't ask for much more,4,"People often complain about the Aztek because of the appearance, but as soon as they get in and go for a ride, they love it.  There is plenty of room for 5 guys, and it is very comfortable for long trips.   I get over 20 MPG going back and forth to work every day and over 25 on the highway.  It also has enough power to stay over the speed limit driving through the Rockies or pulling two snowmobiles on normal roads.  With AWD, I can drive through snow deeper than the front bumper.  Only problem was a sticky latch on the rear hatch, but my dealer promptly fixed that."
pontiac,aztek,2003,Willinois, 10/24/2003,Judging Books by Their Cover,5,"It handles just like a Pontiac Grand 
Prix GTP, which is very good.  The 
interior has many conveniences the 
others don't.  The Aztek is a car you 
have to drive prior to making a 
judgement upon it.  AWD is great for 
those of us in Northern cities."
pontiac,aztek,2003,alan & connie, 10/24/2003,AZTEK IS AOK,5,"The Aztek is a great vehicle.  Comfort 
is the best and gas mileage is 23-29.  
Everyone who rides in mine says the 
ride is terrific.  I tell everyone to 
just get in it and drive one and they 
will be sold.  No problems on my 2003 
yet, 10,000 miles and only slight a/c 
problems on my 2001 that were fixed

problems from day one, so far just 2 
oil changes.  Runs great so far.  Very 
pleased with it, maybe I am just lucky 
to get a good one, I read about the 
problems some people are having with 
theirs.  I am amazed that more and more 
of the new cars are getting that Aztek 
look about them.  I guess the Aztek was 
just ahead of its time.  At the time of 
purchase GM was giving $3000 rebate and 
I had $2,300 in credits from GM 
Mastercard, and a nice dealer discount 
off the sticker, made it a very, very  
good deal for me.    "

enough room for two children but 
doesn't get lost in the sea a cars that 
look alike, the Aztek has delivered!!  
It handles great and is comfortable.  
The removable rear seats allow me to 
move large items easily.  This is an 
American vehicle that was ahead of the 
market.  You don't find many who are 
neutral on its looks - But it is fun to 
see people's reactions change once they 
get in and go for a ride - Never had 
anyone who left unimpressed and have 
had three go out and buy one!  I can't 
say that about any other car I have 
ever owned.  "

SUV's and noticed the firm ride in the 
Aztek is comparable to all of them.

My family loves to rid in this car!"
pontiac,aztek,2003,robert and mary joe, 03/21/2004,aztec,4,"I thought the body was horrible before I
drove it, but the flexability of it
(cornering and u-turns,etc) are
extremely comfortable.  There is no
bouncy ride like my parents SUV and it
has the comfort of a car but I dont feel
afraid to take it on dirt roads or fill
it extremely full and take it cross
country.  I have had few minor repairs
on it and it was all under warranty.  My
complaint is the exhaust system (loud
and rattles a lot) and the time it takes
to warm up.  But over all this might
well be the best vehicle I have owned
while the price was magnificent"
pontiac,aztek,2003,mantis406, 03/23/2004,More than looks,4,"Ok, a lot of people hate the looks of
the Aztek; I personally love it.  There
is so much more to this vehicle that
makes it really great.  Engine has some
power to be desired, but it gets great
mileage (especially compared to other
SUVs) and still has enough power to pull
my two snowmobiles down the highway. 
There are some minor issues like the
rear hatch not always releasing, but
typically a dealer can fix that while
it's still under warranty."
pontiac,aztek,2003,popeye2347, 03/24/2004,You CAN fix ugly.,4,"Like most people the wife and I thought 
it was the most ugly car on the market 
in 2001.  Fast forward to 2003.  We 
needed a new car, and after much 
consideration the Aztek was one of the 
top contenders.  One drive convinced us 
that this was the car for us.  Using 
Edmunds.com we found a good used 2003

true highway trips it seems much 
better.  Not had good luck

decent gas mileage.  Only complaint so 
far is that it's underpowered for 
climbing hills, which is really not a 
problem in Florida.  Back hatch sticks 
sometimes; still trying to get that 
resolved. Could have never gotten all 
the bells & whistles this has on a 
Toyota or Honda for the money. I'm

The check engine light came on, was told it would cost many $ to replace O2 sensors.  Drove directly to dealer and traded in for an Aztek.  On the plus side-typical excellent Pontiac driver layout.  Minus-really sluggish 3.4 v6 compared to the Nissan engine. But it uses regular fuel vs premium. Would I buy another Aztek?  You bet!!  Now, if some dealer will only take my 1999 Maxima in trade so I don't have to fight with my wife over who gets to drive the darn thing!!"
pontiac,aztek,2003,Ann, 10/06/2005,What a drop in value,3,We bought this car new and there is no way to get out of it because the value continues to dive each year.  Had to have lots of little repairs under warranty.  I like the roominess of the car in general.  We have a yellow sport package (spoiler) and I honestly think it's eye catching.  I never have a problem spotting my car in the lots.  Taking trips with this car has been easy.  No major isssues with the engine after 60K

better gas milage, it has it all. Great 
turning, handles great in snow, easy to 
park, fun to drive.  Love the look 
especially with 17"" wheels an sunroof. 
I drove them all and bought the aztec. 
Roomy front and back and loads of 
storage. The cooler and door packs are 
handy and make cleanups easy. Great 
sound system, Love the display on my

My dog loves the car, the back seats and plastic storage container in the back are easily remove to haul stuff. The sight angles aren't great out of the back but are adequate.The car handles well and (knock on wood) in three years I have had 0 problems with it. Great for camping, fishing, moving, tailgating (huge plus) and other activities that guys love. Great for taking your dog on a long trip. I love this car and plan on keeping it for 10 more years.

If you care about what others say or 
keeping up with the Jones, this is not 
the car for you. You will not get a lot 
of compliments on its looks, but when 
you have to load it up with stuff and 
carry things around, its outstanding

pontiac,aztek,2003,vjchap, 02/10/2007,GM Service lowest of the lowest,3,"The enjoyment of this vehicle is overshadowed by having had it in service three times for hub replacement - $600 a wack. The first time was covered by warranty, but the other two times it wasn't. Even the ones that were replaced had to be replaced. 3 times to service for the same defect, once each year for the first three years I owned the vehicle. It would make sense to most consumers that GM would care- but they don't. They even had recalled hubs,and denied me the recall reimbursement. I wouldn't be surprised if I have to replace them again. I only drive the vehicle to work. My husband and I have had several GM products, but we'll never purchase another one. It'll be imports for us now. "

that this Mini-van has too much roll in
it's handling, or that it's underpowered
at the higher end.  As a confirmed sedan
driver, I have always prized a car with
a firm, stable ride.  I really didn't
want a mini-van, but decided on this one
because of it's sure-footed, firm ride.
 The 17 inch tires, on the FWD only,
help it corner very well.  I had no
problem driving on this winter's snowy
roads either.  The 3.4 V-6 has plenty,
and it's geared to give a nice kick at
higher speeds as well. Of course, in the
final analysis, it is a mini-van, not a
sports car."
pontiac,aztek,2003,sgwein, 05/03/2003,Winter Vehicle,4,"With rebate there wasn't another AWD
vehicle with the interior space for the
price. First impressions - extremely
comfortable front seats for a six footer
and need for a rear window wiper.
Couldn't find a thing wrong - everything
worked and no rattles. The handling was
ok  for a SUV - it's no sportscar!. Then
snows came. Without having to shovel it
plowed its way through about 15 inches
of snow in the driveway. The brakes/ABS
are excellent. The front window wipers
were a pain. They had to be dug out of
their ""well"" and sprayed with de-icer
several times through the winter.
Heater, window defrosters worked very
well. All in all a great family vehicle

ones n wishin I had them by now. But 
this car I plan on keeping until the 
legs fall off. Just give one a test 
drive and you also will be hooked!!"
pontiac,aztek,2003,Bill Duffy, 05/16/2003,Aztek - take another look,4,"I love my Aztek, it's so quiet and 
smooth.  Has plenty of options, and I 
get 24 MPG.  Stereo pumps out some fine 
tunes and bass.  Best car I have ever 
had!"
pontiac,aztek,2003,bryan phagan, 05/16/2003,01 blue gt,4,"i have a 01 bought in Oct. 2000 and
love it....."
pontiac,aztek,2003,BrianS, 05/16/2003,Don't know what they're missing,4,"I never intended to buy an Aztek. But, 
after taking one for a test drive; the 
low noise level, comfortable seating 
and smooth ride made my decision. 
Typical issues seem to be the rear 
hatch not opening properly and the BCM 
(Body Control Module) causing unusual 
problems. Both of these items are well 
published, and easily fixed. I haven't 
personally experienced either one. The 
Aztek is incredibly versatile. Packages 
are designed specifically for many 
outdoor activities - including 
tailgating. (The rear door drops down 
pickup-style and has cup holders). 
Anyone considering an Aztek 
should drive one - otherwise, they 
don't know what they're missing!"
pontiac,aztek,2003,Jack Egan, 05/17/2003,Big Bad and Beautiful Red Tek,5,"Ever since the introduction of the 
Aztek I've wanted to own one.When my 
Olds Intrigue died I needed a vehicle 
fairly quick. I knew I wanted an suv 
and went looking at all the candidates. 
I drove an Escape and Blazer and felt 
claustrophobic along with not being 
able to stomach the poor gas mileage 
and poor ride. I then took a ride in a 
Tek and was hooked. The interior was 
spacious, the seating comfortable and 
the 10 speaker system awesome. I 
immediately went into the dealership 
and purchased it. Since I've owned it 
I've averaged 22-24 miles per gallon. 
I've managed to haul a set of 6'8"" 
doors inside and close the hatch. "
pontiac,aztek,2003,maple garland, 05/17/2003,best SUV for the money,5,"I think the looks of the Aztek are 
sleek and sexy.  The model comes in 
many different colors and they all 
look great on the car. The interior 
seats five passengers and it seats 
them very cormfortably.  The gas 
mileage is better than most sux's in 
it class I get 22 mpg averaging.  It 
is very quiet has very little road 
noise inside the compatrment.  It 
handles very well on the road and it 
accelerates fairly well.  It can 
handle itself very well in the snow 
and rain.  The cool features is the 
center console that is also a drink 
cooler/cd holder.  It has a lot of fun 
accessories like the camping package, 
and the bike package. "
pontiac,aztek,2003,halninek, 01/29/2003,No Brainer,4,"Just bought an 03 black with 17"" spoked 
rims, looks sharp.

Got it loaded with everything except 
DVD plus extended warranty for 5000 
bucks less than a stripped V6 Toyota 
Highlander.  It was even less than a 
Hyundai with the same leather and 
sunroof.

Kids are ecstatic, wife loves the dual-
zone climate control.

I love the computer telling me which 
way I'm going, how cold it is outside, 
how many miles to empty, when an oil 
change is due, if my tires are low,and 
if my fly is open.

Coolest family vehicle ever."
pontiac,aztek,2003,Ed H., 05/19/2003,My Electric Blue 2003 Aztek,4,"I purchased this vehicle after 
extensive test drives of other similar 
vehicles.  I was sold on the quality, 
functionality and amount of car I 
received for my money.  It's easy to 
get used to the Aztek's unique look and 
more and more people I talk to say the 
same thing.  The smooth ride and towing 
capacity really convinced me that this 
is the vehicle for my family and me.  I 
think if more people got behind the 
wheel of an Aztek, they also would be 
quite impressed.  I hope GM continues 
to produce the Aztek as I will surely 
purchase another in the future."
pontiac,aztek,2003,OCAztek, 02/20/2003,Love my 'Tek!,4,"I did a lot of research last year 
before ordering my Tek.  I am very 
pleased (and constantly amazed) at the 
ride that I get out of it.  Over the 
Christmas holidays, I drove over 3500 
miles with it fully loaded (4 adults, 
gifts and luggage filling the back and 
a fully loaded rooftop carrier).  I 
had the tow package installed for the 
load leveling and stabilization 
features and it certainly proved it's 
worth.  The handling of it was so good 
that I had to keep reminding myself 
that I had it so loaded.  My parents 
were helping with the driving and I 
had to beg them to let me do some of 
the driving.  They are now looking at 
buying one for themselves!"
pontiac,aztek,2003,GM Owner15, 05/20/2003,Ugly Car but Fun to drive,4,"I have had many GM cars in my life, and 
belive it or not this one drives the 
best.  It has a very smooth ride, you 
site high off the ground and can see 
everything around you.  steering is 
tight, and all controls are within 
reach."
pontiac,aztek,2003,Eve , 05/28/2003,Awesome,4,"This vechicle rides like a car, turns

It is so comfortable and comes with 
standard options that you would pay for 
extra!"

I've ever driven, Or probably ever will."
pontiac,aztek,2003,kritta16, 06/02/2003,Love my 'Tek,4,"So comfortable you will want to fall 
asleep! I traded in a Vibe for this 
much-better made vehicle.  You can fit 
4 kids and 2 adults with no problem. I 
have hauled a twin-sized mattress with 
no problem.  Rides like a dream.  
Driving is a delight again.  Quiet 
ride.  Cannot say enough good things 
about this vehicle.  If you drive one, 
you'll fall in love with it."
pontiac,aztek,2003,Attractive Aztek, 06/08/2003,"Only ugly people drive ""beautiful"" cars",4,"I have never regretted buying my 
Aztek. Its a very useful car, with 
lots of room and better gas mileage 
than I expected. I originally entered 
the market with intentions of buying 
one of the ""typical"" SUVs (Trailblazer 
or Explorer) but soon realized I would 
be overpaying by at least $5K if I 
bought anything other than an Aztek.

Its exterior styling is much improved 
over its first year design and I get 
comments weekly from people impressed 
with the car's looks. And for those 
who aren't I say, ""Only ugly people 
need beautiful cars to feel better 
about themselves."""
pontiac,aztek,2003,tomyo18, 06/09/2003,It's on the inside that counts,4,"Get past the looks and get in the 
vehicle. (Actually, the more you look 
at the 'Tek, the better it looks)
If Pontaic had done a decent job in 
marketing the Aztek, it would have been 
a big success. But they listened to the 
critics who never opened the doors, and 
caved. 
Once you drive it, it's addicting. The 
way it handles, what it can do, the 
pricing; there's not a better buy out 
on the market toady. Do yourself a 
favor: DRIVE IT. You'll buy it."
pontiac,aztek,2003,LadyofShallot, 06/21/2003,Aztek is a sleeper,4,"Looking at the Aztek driving down the 
road is somewhat hard on the eyes.  
The interior is ""youth-oriented"" so a 
little unconventional.  But, it is 
comfortable, smooth riding, and 
incredibly functional."

surefooted AWD, safe side airbags, 
lotsa nifty features for the money;

pontiac,aztek,2003,90 SALEEN, 06/24/2003,Aztek is OK!,3,"Although I agree with most reviews that
the Aztek is not a handsome vehicle,
there  are many qualities to a vehicle
besides looks. We bought our Aztek to
haul, camp, and have enough room to cart
five passengers around. It does all of
these for a price much less than
anything else in its catergory. Overall,
we have been pleased with the Aztek. "
pontiac,aztek,2003,DadMan, 06/30/2003,Mellow Yellow,4,"Terrific ride, excellent sound system,

pontiac,aztek,2003,Ambiegirl, 04/18/2008,So far so good,4,"I got this car after researching it for hours and hours and came to the conclusion it would be a good car considering the lowest rating was a 6.5, compared to a ford explorer which was like a 1.1. I love the design of the car i like unique things and this is definitely unique. My camping vehicle i have been waiting for! I bought it at 68,000 miles and hopefully it has a lot of life left because I noticed ive never seen an Aztek for sale with over 100,000 miles which makes me kind of nervous"
pontiac,aztek,2003,Ray, 04/24/2008,never by another,2,"I got the truck 12/02 new it is an 03  and it has 65,150 mi on it now.

pontiac,aztek,2003,lovethe'teks!, 05/08/2008,"I love Azteks, but...",3,I have had my Aztek for a year and put only 10k miles on it. Even though I have had to replace everything but the seatbelt buckles I still love it. It is very comfortable and handles well with Michigan weather. I don't like the fuel economy (gas is 3.89 here) but can't complain since for it's size it does well. I only need a new fuel pump and I'll be back on the road with the silly looking thing. :D 
pontiac,aztek,2004,IndyLee, 02/26/2010,88K-5+ Years: Going Great.,4,"First was my wife's car.  Became mine last year.  Great road car.  Wish we could get 27-29 mpg, best ever 26.5 on highway.  Got rid of full-size pick-up and took over the Aztek ... not a bad deal.  Few negatives, lots of good stuff.  Stereo rocks.  Pull out tray in rear is wonderful.  If they still made them, we'd buy another."
pontiac,aztek,2004,jodibeth, 10/18/2010,I Love My Aztek,4,I've had my Aztek now for 10 months. I absolutely love it. I went from driving a 1992 Toyota Corolla to the Aztek. Huge change! Indeed a great one though. My husband and son have no problems with not enough room like I did with the previous car. I've not had to replace anything on it but the brakes and tires. It had 92000 miles on it when I bought it. Great gas mileage for an SUV. Awesome stereo system!
pontiac,aztek,2004,azteclover, 09/26/2014,2004 Aztec,4,Great vehicle. 168k and still going strong. Best feature is the versatility of the the interior. Easy to remove seats. 
pontiac,aztek,2004,Alayne, 08/10/2009,My favorite car of all time,4,"My biggest disappointment is that I'll never be able to get another one.  I have loved the reliability, value and function of this car.  Rides fantastic! Great pickup. Function, function, function on the interior. Like everyone else, I would say the rear spoiler causes a major blind spot but you do get used to it.  I have almost 90K on this and still no problems.  I am going to drive it into the ground."
pontiac,aztek,2004,Satreethawk, 07/17/2003,Asteck,3,"Trying to re-start the car after it

right in the line of sight as you look 
in the rear-view mirror."
pontiac,aztek,2004,LORIE, 07/04/2008,Love my Azzie!,4,"My Aztek has been the 'perfect' vehicle for me out all the vehicles I have ever owned!  It's not a girlie (mini-) SUV, but handles like a car.  I love the interior because it's easy to clean up spills. (My three teenagers and I live in the car!)  It is easy to handle, doesn't sit too high or too low, sporty, converts easily for more cargo space, and I easily put my 7-8 foot fresh cut Christmas tree in it! It's been the best investment I've ever made in a vehicle! "
pontiac,aztek,2004,joflier9202, 09/26/2007,Love It!,4,"Driven my Aztek for 2 years, and its been a great experience.  It drives better than my mom's sports car and is the most comfortable for the long trips!  Have had no problems.  Lots of people think they're ugly, but hey, don't knock it until you drive it!  It won over my heart!"
pontiac,aztek,2004,Pontiac Aztec Is A Blessing, 05/08/2019,2004 PONTIAC AZTEC - AN ALL TIME ACE,5,"I am 84-years-old and don't need car problems. Now, in my 16th year with my Aztec, I just don't have any. Tires, brakes, oil are about it. The sweetest jalopy that ever lived has 115,000 miles on it.. My plan is to soon turn it over to my grandson, maybe in another four or five years. Whatever was said about Aztec's styling when it debuted can be chucked. Screw the styling, the car is an absolute winner. Dave LeVine, Fargo, ND
"
pontiac,aztek,2004,Carol, 12/29/2005,Love It,4,"If you can get past the back end of the Aztek and look inside and drive it, you will love it.  When I first saw these on the road I thought they were the ugliest things ever.  When I test drove it, I didn't see the back end and didn't realize it was ""THAT"" car until afterwards.  By then I had already wanted it.   Tons of room! Very comfortable and I don't feel like I will tip over in it like I did in other small SUVs (like the Hyundai Santa Fe).  There are some blind spots however, once you get used to it you learn to work around it."
pontiac,aztek,2004,klthomson, 07/28/2006,was suprised,4,"I'm a ""traditional"" SUV type person and I was kinda skeptical about the Aztek (looks a lil funny), even after we test drove and decided to buy it.  Acceleration is very good, and out performs my Tahoe when it comes to gas mileage.  Over the course of a weekend trip I was averaging aprox 27 mpg hwy, with the ac running too. WOW! My chevy, as much as I love it, wouldnt have done much better than 18 mpg at best.  so on fuel economy, I have no complaints.  The interior is fairly user friendly, and is a comfy ride. About the only thing I dont like is that its AWD and not 4WD. Visibility all around isnt bad."
pontiac,aztek,2004,veblenesque, 05/26/2008,Long-run ownership experience positive,4,"I bought the Aztek because I had GMcard dollars I needed to use, it had big incentives, and I wanted a wagon.  The Aztek has far exceeded my expectations.  After 43k miles, not a single problem.  I get 26 mpg on the freeway, the car rides like a Buick (this is great for freeway, bad for enthusiasts), it has over 100 cubic feet of storage (more than any wagon - check), and the exterior design is actually looking better as it ages.  Interior design is a little cheesy, but incredibly functional and versatile.  Engine and handling are lazy, but smooth and competent.  My wife is in love with this car, and it has been an unmatched value.  Azteks made after the first years are surprisingly reliable"
pontiac,aztek,2004,Aumsville RN, 07/03/2004,Don't underestimate me,5,"The Aztek is fun and unsual to own.  
People look at it wherever I go.  The 
comfort level is better than any other 
SUV type vehicle and not to be 
overlooked in the market place.  It is 
functional for a family or for an 
individual, yet great for hauling 
groceries or home improvement items.  
Backseat room is more than adequate for 
a large man due to the headroom and 
superior legroom.  That 5 can ride in 
comfort is one of the great features.  
A/C & heat vents directed to the rear 
passengers keeps everyone happy.  The 
reclining rear seats allows for 
passenger rest where other models do 
not.  The sound system is terrific!"
pontiac,aztek,2004,Selig, 12/21/2005,Versatile,3,"Unlike many SUVs, the trunk allows you carry taller objects.  The seats come out to create a cargo van.  It carries 4 adults comfortably.  The versatility is really useful for the outside sales type.  The spoiler is the rear-view can create some sight problems, but overall the rear view options are pretty good.  I average 22 miles per gallon, which is a huge change from the Dodge Ram I used to drive.  It has a nice balance of features: High seating for good road vision, reasonable pick up, good gas mileage for an SUV, and versatile (camping trip or diner for four).  From experience, this vehicle does not hold its value.  "

pontiac,aztek,2004,CHERI, 05/01/2006,I Love My Ride!,4,"I wasn't sure I wanted to buy such a strange looking car, but gave it a trial run. Boy! Was I surprised. The Aztec drives and rides like a dream: roomy and comfortable, turns on a dime, and carries just about anything for regular daily use. My husband has arthritis of the spine, so he is really impressed with the heated seats. And we love the idea of dual temperature controls. The tent and air mattress (with an air valve built in one of the cubbies)  were  pleasant surprises, as we are avid campers. I am so glad I didn't let the strange appearance turn me off, besides... It's beginning to grow on me.   "
pontiac,aztek,2004,lspeegle, 04/24/2007,My Azteka,5,"I have enjoyed this vehicle and to date have had no problems. I replaced the battery after three years and factory tires after 75K miles. It has good pick-up and a lot of fun to drive. It has 80,500 miles on it and I have yet to replace the original brakes. I get from 27-29 MPG on the highway. I really like this car."

pontiac,aztek,2004,ejglady, 06/21/2008,Hate it!,2,"The first time I saw an Aztek I knew that one day I'd have one. When I was 7 months pregnant I decided to buy one so that I'd have more room for the baby's things. I'd previously had a Plymouth Breeze. Let's say I should have kept my Breeze. I hadn't had the Aztek a year and I had put over 1,000 dollars worth of work into it. Not only does it feel like it's not going to stop, sometimes I think it may tip over if the wind blows too hard. Now it takes an extra few seconds to start and it has stalled several times while in traffic. Plus, the back seat needs more room. If your over 4 feet tall getting in and out of the back seat is hell. Your feet get caught on the door frame.  "
pontiac,aztek,2004,michelle C, 09/18/2003,I love the Aztek,4,"I have had mine since December and 
although some people still don't like 
the look of it, once they see the 
interior and all of it's ammenities, 
they usually change their mind.  I 
personally like the look, and like to 
be different.  I feel very safe in it 
and have found no other vehicle, that 
compared to it in price and value.  
The only thing that could be better is 
the warrenty.  I think it should be 
like the other competitors and be 5-7 
years instead of 3."
pontiac,aztek,2004,Maru, 04/23/2004,NotSoUglyDuckling,4,"This car is fun to drive and cool to 
look at.  The only drawback is the

SUV, which is why I like it.  I have 
all of the options, including leather

needs but i have found that it is a 
great ride.  It handles like a dream 
and is as silent as the dead.  No 
rattles or squeeks.  I read a great 
deal about the car in many reports and 
web postings and i found that the poor 
reports were unwarranted.  I don't find 
it ugly at all and the report that 
found it to be small and cramped is 
simply wrong.  It has more room than 
any other suv i test drove.  The only 
advised i can give is try it for your 
self don't let some sad sack tell you 
its a bad vehicle.  Oh and you have to 
get the tent WOW what aa great time "

Aztek was a great price for an SUV-type

and the 3.4L V6 provides the power. The 
exterior design was a turn off for me 
at first, but after researching 
vehicles and the more I saw the Aztek, 
the more I like the design. It looks 
very cool and I get plenty of 
compliments from friends and strangers."

show earlier this year, I lose my wife 
among the throngs of people, I consider 
this my chance to check out the 
Porsches, then I hear ""Oh Bill look at 
this.""  I turn around and see this 
thing.  Here's Angela sitting in an 
Aztek. It's black, it's angular, it's 
so different.  She says sit so I sit.

year now and it has been a blast. The 
car is responsive, easy to manuever, 
and I have never seen another SUV or 
Van or crossover of the two have such 
a tight turning circle. The power is 
adequate when you need it. The ride is 
smooth as they come and good enough to 
support the better looking Buick 
Rendezvous. Yes, the looks are not 
great, but they wear on you. What is 
great is the interior design: lots of 
storage space, no driver is too tall 
to fit in and five adults fit in with 
plenty of comfort. Aztec is great and 
I highly recommend it!"

pontiac,aztek,2004,Bobby G, 10/21/2003,WOW this ROCKS!!!,4,"I only test drove this SUV because it 
was on the same lot a Jeep Liberty.
The AzteK blow it away on all accounts. 
It better at the gas pump and is more 
fun to drive. I got the FWD but should 
have gone to the AWD. "
pontiac,aztek,2004,roadwarryr, 10/22/2003,Superb Vehicle,4,"Had my '02 for almost a year now, and it is 
great.  I've hauled heavy loads, and except for 
up steep hills, it did a decent job.  Only real 
problem has been the HUD...haven't taken it in 
yet, but i think the wire is loose.  Great 
mileage for a lumbering beast.  Steering is 
great, handling too except in high wind.  Love 
all the unique features (cooler, air compressor, 
etc).  GM:  tweak it on a lambda platform!  
Don't kill the car!!!"

visability questionable other than that

Van for the 03 Aztec.  Love that 
Aztec!  Fun to drive, easy to handle.  
Extremely happy with the features.  
When you still need room, but not THAT 
much room, this is a perfect vehicle 
and reasonably priced."

totally love it.  It is the primary 
vehicle for my family, we take it 
everywhere!  It's comfortable and very 
roomy.  I don't spend anymore on gas 
than I did with a car and my insurance 
premiums didn't go up either.  Great 
vehicle!"
pontiac,aztek,2004,ducky, 11/07/2003,so far so good,4,"A very cosy and secure-feeling 
vehicle.Drives more like a mini-van but 
has the versatilityof an SUV. Appears 
very reliable at a relatively low 
price, making it good value for the 
money.If you are searching for a unique 
vehicle(it`s called an SRV by GM) that 
rides higher than a standard car and 
offers many good options(e.g.,excellent 
sound system), Aztek(named after 
aboriginals of Mexico where it is built)
is worth a look!"
pontiac,aztek,2004,Rara, 11/08/2003,Love it,4,"I really do love my Aztec.  I think it 
is a very cool looking vehicle.  I love 
the interior as well.  I like the back 
lower window, making it easier to see 
small children walking behind the 
vehicle.  There is plenty of space for 
the kids that I car pool around town.  
I love that this vehicle is not the 
same as all the others, I like to stand 
out and be different!  Love it, love 
it. Great on gas too!!  Ra"

pontiac,aztek,2004,Mokole, 11/22/2003,We just call it the,5,"I have a white GT 2001 and it was the 
best deal ever.  Some people may not 
like the looks but the advantage to 
its unique design is that it is real 
easy to find it in the parking 
lot. ;)   Superior handling, gas 
mileage and safety compared to other 
SUVs. Cooler and extra cigarette 
outlets make trips easier (for 
accessories like laptops).  Rear flip, 
fold and removing rear sets opens up 
allot of room.  Mine also came 
with the cargo tray which is useful 
for travel luggage and groceries.  
This car is fun to drive because it 
rides nice and silent.  Everyone I 
know who has been in my car has 
learned to appreciate it if not really 
like it."
pontiac,aztek,2004,minime716, 12/03/2003,First Car,4,"This is my first new car.  It is great 
as it is an SUV with fuel economy.  
However it does need thinner tires as 
it slides with minor wet roads and 
snow.  I have not driven in a full 
winter yet so not sure howthat will 
work.  I hope it is good as I drive 
alot in the snow"
pontiac,aztek,2004,Love to drive, 12/03/2003,Great Vehicle,5,"I got this car for my wife, she loves  
it and I also enjoy driving it. I think 
next time we will get all wheel drive, 
it would be nice to have we live in 
upstate Ny and we get lots of snow up 
here. If u buy a vib u won't be sorry, 
its also excellent on gas."

purchased it.  My son thought the 
design was great and we began the 
adventure.  The car requires alot of 
maintenance and appears to be in the 
shop every other month for some new 
issue.  Pontiac charges for each 
diagnostic check and then the labor, 
then the parts......the car is 
menopausal."

pontiac,aztek,2004,SethNShannon, 01/01/2004,We love our AZTEK,5,"We disagree with your editor's review 
of this vehicle.  We researched and 
drove many vehicles before purchasing 
our AZTEK. My husband, who has 
experience with racing vehicles claims 
that the all-wheel drive traction 
control system is one of the better 
designed. It's visibility is better 
than any car we have owned.  It has 
proven to be quite safe.  We were 
rear-ended recently and were barely 
left with a scratch, while the other 
vehicle had to be towed away. It 
handles exceptionally well and we would 
recommend it to anyone who wants an SUV 
packed with the features and 
performance you would expect, without 
the price tag of more common SUV's. "
pontiac,aztek,2004,BUDD, 01/05/2004,My AZTEK2001,5,"This is one of the better and safest 
ride on the road today and mine is 
front wheel drive only and it is one of 
the better suv in all of the other one 
and yes I would buy another one if and 
when I wear this one out or trade it in 
on a new one which I hope will not be 
any time soon.PS this is one hell of a 
SUV."
pontiac,aztek,2004,rkmantri, 01/06/2004,I Think I made an excellent choice,5,"The interior is very cozy.  Once we 
test drove it, my wife and I stopped 
looking for any other SUV.  Its very 
affordable!!!"
pontiac,aztek,2004,Dr Will B, 01/11/2004,Best of the New Breed,5,"Checked out all the competition.  More 
head room, easy in and out, fun 
features.  Basically all th bells and 
whistles on a luxury suv with the 
interior of a sport model.  Very 
practical and a real head turner.  
Deserves a 2nd and 3rd look before you 
decide."
pontiac,aztek,2004,jklnx, 01/11/2004,luv it,4,"very fun to drive. the interior design 
is very comfortable. the little extras 
make the interior comfortable for 
passengers and drive. the drive is 
quiet, smooth and comfortable. the 
turning radius is better than i 
expected. i can't wait to try the awd 
out in the snow and ice. i am sure it 
won't disappoint."
pontiac,aztek,2004,gogoclown, 01/23/2004,2004 Aztek,4,"I bought this ""truck"" to replace my 
van.  Didn't realize the reach over 
the back end.  Also, didn't realize 
how impairing the strip through the 
back window could be.  Lots of blind 
spots in this vehicle.  When it rains 
or snows....the back window gets yucky 
with no way to clean it.  I haven't 
driven it during snow, but there's no 
way to get rid of snow on the big back 
window, either.  My experience with 
the sliding rear cargo tray....I took 
it out after 3 days.  What a waste of 
space.  And...when I went to roll the 
cargo tray out of the back, all the 
stuff that was on it rolled back into 
the car."

affordabilty and overall preformance. 
I have took it on vacations with the 
camping attachment, works great. I can 
haul all sizes of cargo as the seats 
conform in many ways to accomidate 
passengers and purchaces. Always 
starts, smooth ride, no road sounds. "
pontiac,aztek,2004,jsjax, 01/21/2004,$ for $ Blows All The Others Away,4,"I went on the car lot with no intention 
of buying a vehicle.  As a matter of 
fact, I drove a Pontiac Vibe, but 
wasn't too impressed.  I then saw an 
Aztek, and told the salesman I wanted 
to take it for a spin.  WOW!  I was 
impressed.  So impressed I drove it 
home, showed my wife, she liked it, and 
did a deal in a matter of hours.  Drove 
out with a FWD model w/ moonroof, 
stereo, A/C, power everything for UNDER 
$20k -- Drive out price!!  I've driven 
SUV's that cost twice as much that are 
far less impressive than the Aztek.  
Sure, it looks a little different, but 
once you get behind the wheel, you're 
hooked!"
pontiac,aztek,2004,mf12345678, 01/31/2004,Aztek Rocks!,5,"Overall, best value for this size 
suv.Sure you can get more conventional 
looks, but it ,ll cost 5-10k more. 
Plus, i like the sporty lines and while 
i think they could be a little more 
refined, say along the lines of a 
larger version of the vibe, the actual 
sillouette of the car is very much the 
same as the new bmw suv and the lexus 
330. Pontiac pioneered it, and while 
the others may have arguably improved 
on it,they're remarkably quite similar. 
Car mag also complained about the split 
rear window, yet honda sports cars have 
used them since the 80's and mercedes 
does also. The car is priced like a 
cute ute yet hauls like a mid size. It 
really can't be beat."
pontiac,aztek,2004,cooper3517, 02/13/2004,CHRISTINE,2,"This vehicle seems to have a mind of 
it's own. The radio changes channels by 
itself. The vehicle shuts off when 
sitting at a light. The hatch will not 
open with the remote unless you pull up 
on the hatch with your hands. Not 
enough leg room in the back seat."
pontiac,aztek,2004,roger , 02/13/2004,Pontiac's best buy!,5,"I love my Aztec. I have two 
grandbabies now and we gave up our 
Jeep Wrangler for a bigger vechical.  
My Aztec rides and drives great. I 
have plenty of power for the highway 
and it is perfect for around town 
shopping. What a deal I got on it. I 
hope my salesman doesn't get fired. 
This car is white with the body side 
molding the same color instead of last 
years model of contrasting with 
black.  It also has 16"" alloy wheels 
that make it really stand out. They 
say beauty is in the eye of the 
beholder but I think people are 
judging the Aztec on past models and 
really need to drive one of these to 
see what they are missing.  I truly 
have a classic in the making."

production - I wasn't impressed.  Since 
that time my opinion has drastically 
changed!  I love my 2003 model.  Fun 
car for me and my family!  Follow-up 
care at the dealership is, as usual, 
superb!"

great (10-speaker XM radio w/ controls

environment controls). I like the 
looks. Camping package is unique. Some 
complain about poor rear visibility, 
but the rear window goes so low it is 
good.  Bottom rear window is vertical & 
doesn't need a wiper.  Mileage is fair, 
but driver information center supports 
better driving habits.  HP is OK, with 
cruise control @75mph I went up a 
pass.  My Rally edition rides better 
than a non-Rally I tested.  I've had 
this vehicle a month, so reliability

it.  I brought it over to show my wife 
and she was fuming when I pulled up 
with it.She hated the look of it, but 
I told her to shut up and drive it.  
She did and fell in love with it.It 
has 31,000 miles on it and we haven't 
had a problem with it.  We also tried 
out the Sante Fe and found it to be 
smaller and didn't have as many 
features inside.We get 23 mpg with the 
all wheel drive one and that is just 
as good as it's competitors, it's a 
little bigger to me inside.I myself

pontiac,aztek,2004,KrisT, 06/02/2006,where am I and what's around me?,2,"Great price for a car/truck/suv mix breed. That is where it stops. ABS is an option on this vehicle (where it was a standard feature on the 2003 model). On wet roads the traction/steering are very weak. A lot of blind spots. Vehicle very awkward shaped and weight distribution to be a front wheel drive. Sometimes I wonder if the thing is going to stop when I hit the brakes--Tires like to lock up or I roll through the stop sign. Overall... If it is a dry summer day on a long straight road with no traffic.. this vehicle is optimal to own.. 22 mpg in town/30mpg hiway. Anything that is offroad, curves, traffic, non asphalt/cement... normal driving conditions...this vehicle has a mind of its own."

cars to large vans and 1 ton pickups.

This car is also the most versatile 
vehicle that we have ever owned.  The 
folding rear seats and moveable cargo 
tray make it a great all around car 
for the family and animals. 

I hope Pontiac will get behind this

gas mileage around town is so-so, 
about 18 or 19, but on the open road I 
get 25+ (as long as I keep my speed 
around 65).  There's plenty of room 
for the family and for 
hauling ""stuff.""  My package has the 
roll-out floor in the back - a real 
plus.  It's a lot of car for the money 
(With rebates, I got over $6000 off 
the sticker.)  I'd buy it again 
anytime!"

pontiac,aztek,2004,coaker, 06/02/2004,aztek review,4,"I love it. It is a good mix between a 
mini van and a suv. It was something 
both my husband and I could agree on 
and it drives like a dream! He likes 
the fact he can take it fishing and use 
the seats on the tail gate. This 
comment is for EVERY vehical, I just 
wish the back seats tilt back. At fist 
the back end looks funny and it takes 
some time getting use to looking out 
the back but once you get over that it 
is the best thing in the world and I 
would defentaly buy another in a heart 
beat!"

love the tent attachment with

with 3 kids that is important, the 3 
love the reclining back seat. Love the 
console/cooler. Are some blind spots, 
but you can overcome that obsticle. We 
have had to the dealership too many 
times for a vibration over 55mph (and I 
do alot of hwy driving) we have had two 
new tires, new springs, reallignments 
done.  Have had back breaks replaced.

Aztec. We took a lot of time looking 
for a new vehicle, wanting more room 
than our '01 XL7 offered. The Aztec is 
everything we wanted and more. It's so 
comfortable that you quickly grow to 
love the entire vehicle. Plus, it was 
a great deal, it's like a best kept 
secret or something, we got an '04 
demo w/7100 miles for a fraction of 
the orginal MSRP. Reviews for this 
vehicle are great, take the time to

I'm a fan.  I got mine in bright red, 
which really does this truck justice.  
It has an excellent ride, better than 
many I rode in.  I researched SUV's for 
8 months before buying this.  I know I 
made the ride choice.  There is no SUV 
made that can offer as much as the 
Aztek does at the price.  I drove away 
with close to $8,000 off sticker.  I 
don't know any other vehicle in this 
price range that can offer you that.  
It's comfortable, very smooth, and 
quiet inside.  The stereo is awesome, 
although it is a little difficult to 
figure out how to use.  "

an Aztek!  It is one of the best 
vehicles on the road, regardless of 
what people say about its looks!  
Personally, I bought it for its 
looks...I did not want something that 
everyone else had....I have never been 
that type of person.  The bottom line 
is that it takes a certain person to 
look past the exterior of a person or a 
thing.  The Aztek offers much more than 
I could ever hope for in a vehicle...it 
is comfortable, extremely fuel 
efficient and has a smooth ride.  I 
averaged 40+ miles per gallon while 
driving around the U.P. of 
Michigan...what does that tell ya?  My 
Lupe' is dependable & reliable!"
pontiac,aztek,2004,PracticalOne, 09/14/2004,Room for all,4,"The best reason to buy this car is for 
the roominess.  It may not be the 
sleekest design, but the boxy shape 
allows for plenty of room in the back 
seat.  We easily fit three kids 
(including two in car seats).  Very 
practical car.  Fun to drive - have had 
no problems with it.  It is our second 
one."
pontiac,aztek,2004,occoquan1, 11/30/2004,Best Value/Most Features for Your Money,4,"What sold me on this vehicle was the 
ride.  It has a decent interior, not 
too cramped, easy to find controls, and 
an interesting exterior style all it's 
own.  This SUV runs smoothly, and 
doesn't have a truck feel at all. Very 
quiet, yet responsive.

The list of features on my vehicle, for 
the price I paid is amazing.  
Admittedly, I bought a used 2004, but 
it only had 3110 miles on it.  It still 
smells new.  This is a great vehicle 
and bargains can be had.  This has been 
a much maligned vehicle and does not 
deserve the bad reputation it has 
garnered.  Take a look, take a test 
drive, you will be pleasantly 
surprised.  But hurry, rumor has it 
that the 2005 model year will be its 
last."

Our Aztek is probably the best looking one on the road.  Black w/ 17"" factory alloys, auto-leveling suspension with rear compresser jack, 2 tone heated leather seats, moonroof, trip computer, spoiler..every option but AWD and the Pioneer stereo.  Apparently Onstar was also an option but you couldn't have a moonroof with that package.. I also bought the optional camping package online for $300 which I've used 2 times. FWD w/traction control gets better MPG than AWD and handled great in 06 Michigan winter...its too bad this vehicle was discontinued."

I've replaced hub assemblies often but have it down to a science. I am having a problem with a clunking noise in the front end right now AFTER changing the ball joints, tie rods, struts and CV joints/half shafts. I'm thinking it's time for control arm bushings to get rid of it. This has been the most reliable car I can and will ever own, it's only left me stranded once when the alternator went out......not bad for 428K and 11 years of daily driving.
"
pontiac,aztek,2005,ducttapeeng, 09/08/2012,Will be missed,4,"Our Aztec died in a crash recently and it will be missed.
The minivan based design allowed it to be a great snow ski hauler since ski's fit under the seat.
Although the spoiler did restrict rear vision - it also appeared to always block the headlights of the car behind us when they were tailgating.
It got us everywhere we needed to go.
The front seats of all cars are comfortable but the often forgotten rear seat [I guess most parents think it is the kids problem not theirs] was very comfortable for the Aztec.
If the look can be ignored, the function is great.
Note: some Aztec's inherited all the problems.
Find a good one and keep it for life."
pontiac,aztek,2005,Lex, 09/14/2005,Watch out for breakdowns,3,"The Aztek small community makes it difficult to learn and share with other drivers. My odometer came out reading ""error""... if a small light on the dash breaks, you must send in the entire unit loosing your car for 3 + days to change a tiny lightbulb... the battery change requires a 2 hour job by a professional mechanic whereas in previous cars i could easily do so myself... the mirror fell off in 100 degree heat... the resale value is down to 6000 at carmax after just 3 years.. i would love to hear from other buyers so i can prepare myself for other aspects which i might put some prevention into to avoid repeating your finds, i would be happy to share my experience."

We have a New Yorker that my husband drives but it doesn't get any miles on it if we are going together. We always jump in the AZTEK.

I use to drive a small compact car prior to buying the Aztek, so I wanted something larger but not to large. The Aztek was the perfect size and had the amount of room I was looking for. It's so easy to get in and out of it and can stuff so many things in it. Last year, I had to take my Aztek back to dealership because my gauges were not reading correctly. I would fuel up and the gauge indicated that I was on empty. My speedometer would indicate I was driving at 120 miles per hour when I was actually driving at 30mph. Luckily I had the gold insurance plan and got everything fixed for $50 (deductible). "

I have recently had problem with rattling while applying my brakes especially down hill.  Took it in and fixed for free.  I have not tried out the camping package yet however hopefully next year.  I think Pontiac should change their commercial.  I would of never of thought to buy this car.  The commercial makes it look so small and only concentrate of the cooler between the front seat.  Show this car off it is hugh on the inside.  I put 2 twin boxsprings & 2 mattresses in the back end

Anyone who wants to laugh at it or make fun of me for buying it can do it but they don't know what kind of FUN they are missing! The vehicle is very responsive on curves and in the snow it goes thru any depth. We love all the room in the back because you can carry anything. It's just a FUN car to drive. We already feel like this vehicle is a part of the family!
pontiac,aztek,2005,Mike, 08/13/2010,I love this car!,4,I've had my Aztek for about 5 years now and it's perfect for us.  It washes up to look great for executive meetings and transforms to a great family rig for weekends on the coast.  I have a two package and pull a trailer with gear for longer trips. Plenty of room.  It runs great. 80k miles and still strong.  My only thing is the sunroof is flawed.  Had it repaired 5 times and it still doesn't work.  I'm looking for a second one now. 
pontiac,aztek,2005,kathey sisemore, 01/12/2005,owner,4,"I love the handling and the versatility and the over all performance of the Aztek.   The only thing is I have had a lot of problems with the car locking in park due to the(bitsy) part of the braking system and the block ( brain with the fuses) being loose and then melting. My family and myself was stranded in Mississippi for a day and a half because of the block.  Now the wires have melted, unknown reason.   I would keep the car except I have driven a rental more than I have driven mine.   So I am trading my Aztek for another Aztek.  Just to see if i got a lemon the first time.

pontiac,aztek,2005,Cleo Clark, 02/27/2005,We like it,5,"We've previously always had a van because of the convenience in traveling so was reluctant to get the Aztek. Shortly after purchasing, we took an approximate 3500 mile trip. It was great. We especially liked the convenience of back access. We also have luxury feataures of DVD, heated seats, built in ice chest, etc. and especially felt much safer with the Onstar. In fact, used it to get directions and when couldn't find the keys they opened it for us from wherever. So far, we are very pleased with our Aztek."

When my husband read they were discontining them this year (05) we drove from Georgia to Ohio to get the model we wanted...they are so comfortable, have so many included features that cost more on other makes, are such fun to drive...we love our Aztek! Who cares if Jay Leno makes fun of them!"
pontiac,aztek,2005,Aztek, 05/12/2005,Pontiac's secret,5,"Last fall I had to purchase a new vehicle.  The 2004 Aztek was one of my purchasing options.  I have never been happier with a vehicle.  I believe it is one of Pontiacs best kept secrets that the general public has a tendency to overlook simply because it doesn't fit their ideal mold of a reasonable looking vehicle.  When driven conservatively, the Aztek may get 24 mpg.  In 170 miles, used 6gls of gas (holds approx 18gls).  Driving reasonably under winter driving conditions, this vehicle drives like a tank - my biggest surprise yet!  I feel safe transporting my child in this vehicle, and am happy to take other passengers along.  This a reasonable SUV for reasonable budgets!"
pontiac,aztek,2005,Bri, 06/10/2005,"Interesting thing, this Aztek",3,"A surprisingly practical car. Good cargo capability (but not minivan good), good gas mileage (much like a minivan's), respectable performance (a lot like a minivan). But, my wife and I weren't ready for the minivan niche. Certainly a love/hate appearance, but we have the ""Rally"" edition, which I think gives a more pleasing flavor to the underlying Aztek weirdness. A recent (May 2005) recall on the ignition system is a must-fix; we just started experiencing the effects (kind of ironic, in a way), which include vehicle stalling. In-laws have a Chevy Equinox, which I like better. However, the Aztek might have the price advantage given its impending discontinuation and overall poor sales."

placement of the rear spoiler..   "
pontiac,aztek,2005,cordle, 10/09/2004,A POSITIVE REVIEW,4,"    I purchased this automobile because 
it was the only one offered in the 
price range that I could afford. After 
owning and driving this auto for the 
past year, I am so glad that it was the 
one I bought. I have driven it on the 
highway and in town and could not be 
more comfortable now feel more safe 
than in the Aztec. It is not the most 
beautiful design but everyone knows 
where I am in this town! I needed an 
auto that was easy to get in and out of 
and this has been ideal. I hope that 
more people will look for quality and 
not beauty and try this auto."
pontiac,aztek,2005,reedrat, 10/29/2004,I love the look of this car,4,"I wish they had kept the body cladding 
of the earlier models, but this is one 
cool looking car.  It is fun to drive, 
safe, and comfortable.  Interior 
quality is much improved over 2001, 
which haf poor fabric.  I'm surprised 
some find it ugly or weird looking, but 
that makes it a great used car buy."
pontiac,aztek,2005,ianearthstarr, 11/12/2004,Love it! so why don't others,4,"I just Love my Aztek and the dealer 
tells me Aztek owners all feel strongly 
about them.  I like the ""Tiger ready to 
pounce"" exterior look and so does my 
fiance.  She bought a Red Vibe and now 
that I have this vehicle she keeps 
trying to drive it and leave me withthe 
smaller car.  We can fold the seats all 
the way up and stow 2 bicycles in the 
back to go riding on the Cedar Valley 
Nature trail, and then fold them down 
and take anotrher couple out to eat 
that nite.  It handles well and has 
enough get-up to meet my needs and the 
gas milkage is acceptable.  I fail to 
understand why reviewers say it is 
awkward to handle as  most owners like 
the interior comfort and handling."
pontiac,aztek,2005,Craig, 12/11/2004,Aztek?,4,"Yes we bought an Aztek. We went with the 
rally package. It makes a big difference 
in appearance. It still has a huge back 
end but overall I think its a really 
great vehicle. They even thought of a 
shoulder belt that can drop down for 
someone riding in the middle of the 
back seat. It turns really well for a 
SUV. The only draw back I have seen so 
far is that there is not a lot of 
places to mount extra's. Even though it 
is a SUV it has a great step in height 
for children."
pontiac,aztek,2005,orangefire, 12/11/2004,luvmytek,5,"I bought my tek because i was tired of 
my Hyundai and was on a limited budget. 
I did my homework on the vehicle: GM 
was offering 4,000 rebates, plus one 
for 1,000 that the dealer didn't tell 
me about. Total vehicle price out the 
door 18,000. For the space, handling, 
comfort and compliments that this 
vehicle gets, you would think that I 
paid over 30,000. Aztek is Pontiac's 
best kept secret. I love this car so 
much that i will trade my other 
Hyundai and get one for my wife before 
all of the 05's are gone.The equinox 
(aztek replacement) cannot hold a 
candle to this vehicle in 
style, features, or PRICE. My mom has an 
03 trailblazer (she paid 32,000 for it) 
that isn't as roomy, versatile or good 
on gas as my tek. "

SUV around as I wouldn't trade it for 
the most expensive SUV on the market.I 
camp out with this Aztec often. It's 
great outdoor fun. My canoe fits nicely

rebates, we got our 2005 Aztek out the 
door for under $15000-new.  Had looked 
at the Vibe and Suzuki Aerio, but the 
Aztek came out cheaper, with the same 
features and lots more room.  Very 
comfortable ride and acceleration is 
sufficient.  May not be comparable 
quality to foreign competition, but 
the price was absolutely unbeatable."
pontiac,aztek,2005,Keith, 01/01/2005,Under-Rated,4,"My 2003 Pontiac Aztek is a great 
vehicle -- one of the best SUVs on the 
market.  The simpletons in the 
automotive press could not get past the 
admittedly awkward-looking exterior.  
Get inside and experience the 
functional interior, great for hauling 
people, equipment, groceries, 
anything.  Drive it to experience 
exceptional ride and handling. Quality 
is outstanding. I have had zero 
reliability or maintenance problems; 
only regular oil changes.  And with the 
cash incentive I received, I think it 
is one of the best hidden values on the 
market."
pontiac,aztek,2005,clint, 01/15/2005,good value,4,"We hadn't even considered the Aztek when shopping for a new car.  Figured that an economy car was the only thing in our budget.  Went looking at the Pontiac Vibe and saw the Aztek in the showroom.  With the GM redtag clearance and other discounts, we got our 2005 FWD Aztek out the door for under $15000.  Excellent value, a lot of features, outstanding interior room.  The only unknown is how it will hold up over the years. Right now I'm quite happy with it.  The exterior appearance takes a bit getting used to.  If you can get over the outward appearance, the Aztek is quite a good deal. It's not a Vette, so I don't buy the complaints about power-it's power and acceleration are just fine."
pontiac,aztek,2005,potsie, 02/06/2005,ugly but awesome,4,"never intended to buy. dealer gave me the deal of a lifetime 15106.00 out the door, taxes license the works! I test drove the Aztek but really was looking at the Buick Rendevous. The ride in the Aztek was just as good as the Buick and $6500 cheaper. I love driving the Aztek and the pickup is great and the versatility is just what I needed. My son is 16 and can't wait to get his hands on it !!!"
pontiac,aztek,2005,WILLIAM MICHAUD, 03/05/2005,Pontiac Aztek,4,"Despite the negative reviews I have read, I find this vehicle to be  a great handling SUV.

I can also take 3 adults with me with plenty of room and comfort. It really moves on the road too. Very snappy response to get around slow movers fast and safely. Handles like a dream on corners and on the open road. I love it. Plus, it's ugly and nobody will steal it. "
pontiac,aztek,2005,Lisa L, 06/22/2005,Aztek Review,4,"Just purchased this vehicle.  We LOVE it. We were told that many people thought it was ugly - and we've actually had the opposite experience.  I was stopped at a light the other day and a group of kids in their 20's said ""Awesome Wheels!"".  I like the look of it and I like that it doesn't look like everyone else's car!  People also said it is difficult to see out the back - it took me no time at all to get used to it.  I have no complaints whatsoever.  I completely recommend it and since they aren't making them anymore - you can get a pretty good deal on them right now. "

People feel they need to talk to me and tell me how cute my car is!  I hope others who have it feel the same as I do.  Unfortunately, It takes $40 to fill the tank but I'm not worried.  I will still drive my Azzy around town.   "
pontiac,aztek,2005,LuvnDodge, 09/02/2005,Good Buy but Ugly Car,4,"Fast Car that hugs curves. No need to work about flipping this one over like many other inport mini-SUV's, Great Gas mileage for the power in this cars engine. Expect to be peeling out frequently if you have a lead foot. Passing up cars is a breeze. This car is very responsive. the only complaint is the design. My friend calls it the tin can, but a better look would have taken away the huge cargo area."
pontiac,aztek,2005,Jmamadei, 03/26/2007,Nice ride if you like the looks.,4,"I never even considered an Aztek when I was shopping for a car but there it was with low miles and a good price so I was sold and I really love it. Everything about it is convenient and easy to use also, it sits high enough to give a good view of the road without being difficult to climb into. Gas mileage is acceptable (19-20mpg) and reliability has been good during my first 500 miles. However, if you change your own oil its really hard to get the filter out because of the front frame crossmember so plan on wearing half of your oil the first time you change it."

pontiac,aztek,2005,JOHN TINGLE, 01/01/2018,"CLASSY FUN CAR, BIG INSIDE AND SMALL OUTSIDE",4,"All black with taupe interior stands out as the best looking combination for this vehicle. Good high seats and large glass area is a winner. Extra large and handy hatch area is another plus to consider. Being'05 vehicle still has refined feeling with smooth six power. Typical gm negatives such a having to change the secondary shaft 2xs as well as the rack and pinion steering noise, all under warranty thank goodness. Dash electrical issues at 80k including losing trans indicator lights and odometer lights. Styling looks better with age as newer vehicles are looking more weird and have little window area thus providing safety issues as well as visual threats. This is my 2nd Aztek which my family has grown to appreciate even more over time. Have offers for $5500 plus which would make this vehicle a good value over the long run. 
Update. July 1, 2019 Now with 108k miles and running better then ever. Had to replace the driver's seat cushion( via a parts place in Georgia) as the backrest adjuster shaft broke at the handle knob. Luckily, the replacement was just like my taupe original seat!. Shaft sits below seat cushion adnd is not available by separate sale. $150.00 to buy/replace the seat.

of ""things"" on this car, no tire rods 
were on the car, rackingppion has had 
to be replaced 4 times, cadlic 
converter had to be replaced, several 
items, list to long to mention, in my 
opinion Pontiac should recall the 
models from the year 2000, to 
many ""little"" problems that have had to 
be replaced! Also the interior dash

peeling around the gear shift, radio,

Inside ceiling fabric falling down. Door panels coming loose. All 4 windows broke. The back 2 broke 2-3 times each (Went down and stayed down). Some of the wiring is off. But in all, the car handles pretty well. And since I am a new driver, it was an easy car because we've had the car for over 11 years, and I am used to the feel of how it rides. But try to avoid pot holes because they can shut the car off.

I bought it in Nov/2013 with 95,000km (57,000mi) it was completely rust free and fit the price, It needed new air ride shocks in the back, but other then that it was practically new. In the 2 months i have owned it, it has performed well, although the passenger rear door lock has stopped working, otherwise though nothing has broken. it does have it's issues, sure, what car doesn't. however, i think it is a great machine for a great price these days and i really am thrilled with my purchase and i encourage anyone looking for a fun, reliable cool looking car to not pass up the 2000-2005 Bonneville's, they're great :)"

had nothing done to it except 
scheduled maintenance in 50,000+ miles 
of driving. Only problem is an 
annoying shimmy at 70mph which started 
in front and went to the rear after I 
rotated the tires, so it's either a 
bum tire or a wheel hole off center. 
This is a lot of car for the money. My

Steering column continuously makes clunking noise when turning. GM says it needs to be serviced, but OK/safe to drive with the noise. Overall, I've spent less than $2000 out of pocket in 6 years.

Also, despite its size, I average almost 25 mpg, and I'm not a light pedal pusher either. However, I have had similar issues as other owners. The steering shaft, brake rotors, power windows and flickering lights. I too bought an extended warranty and this helped.  However, now that it's out of warranty things could get expensive. The steering and brake rotors are my biggest complaint. However, it is a great looking car, definitely fun to drive for a full size vehicle and thus far, reliability really hasn't been an issue, mostly a few modest annoyances. "

After reading other reviews, I am concerned about the steering and rotors.  I plan to replace the front rotor soon.  I would really like to find a decent repair manual, but can't locate one.

We've been very pleasantly surprised after 1.5 years.  The Bonneville is always reliable, runs smooth and powerful, and still has no squeaks or rattles at 59K miles now.  MPG averages 24, mixed city and hwy, which is great for such a roomy car.  Only weird thing is that GM did not put a remote trunk release in this car, so you have to use the key.  I really recommend as a used car."
pontiac,bonneville,2000,sclass_benz, 12/20/2007,Solid Value for the Money,4,"I've owned my 2000 Bonneville for 10 months now and have been very pleased. It always starts easily and runs strong.  Being a previous Honda owner, I had some concerns about squeaks and rattles showing up in a GM product, but I've been pleasantly surprized, the ride is nice and quiet and there are no rattles.  I am averaging 22+ miles per gallon (city/hwy combined) and there is definitely plenty of power.  Only complaint is that a remote trunk release was an option that I don't have, so you have to turn off the motor, then use the key to open the trunk.  Highly recommended and a great value."

BUY ANOTHER. I LOVE THIS CAR"
pontiac,bonneville,2000,BCORTIS, 02/12/2009,The good and the bad,4,"Overall I love my Bonneville! I love the way it handles. Lots of room for taller people like myself. Gas mileage is good for the size of the car. The engine has been reliable, The main problem I've had with this car is the windows! I have to replace both regulators in the back doors and the front passenger motor seems very sluggish. Some rusting right on the edge of the front hood not sure if that's normal for this model. I did have to have the trunk lock cylinder taken out and unjammed/cleaned. Of course brakes and rotors seem to wear quicker than normal. I also tried to convert radio/cassette to CD but couldn't because of factory settings. Otherwise I absolutely love my Bonneville."
pontiac,bonneville,2000,gary mcgaffic, 08/15/2009,built for the road,5,"Great road handling ability, stabilitrak is fantastic but scary at first. Heads up display is great, day or night. The under side of the suspension system is built like a tank, extremely rugged. I get over 26 mpg on the highway which is great for a supercharged car of this size. As of 08/14/09 only 51,000 mile on it. Sill looks new..."

Dealership unable to fix 5 times. Would 
not buy another one."
pontiac,bonneville,2000,Pink Arzora, 01/30/2010,We got the lemon,3,"I've had many Bonne's & they've gone forever, but this one was a complete $$ pit. In 11 months and a total $7000 investment it sits in a junk yard. The ignition locked up, the gas gauge didn't work, the catalytic rattled, the struts - shot, the sunroof broke & leaked, the window motors were failing, and after 500 into trans to save it - still slipping, and then 700 into engine for it to throw a rod. It hurt to see such a beautiful car that we babied to go to sh*t. It had 129K when we bought it, Bose/Onstar/SuperCharge/Tinted/Leather - thought would be our reliable car, but my 94 Bonne turned out to live longer and WAY more reliable."
pontiac,bonneville,2000,kevmark, 07/14/2002,"Fun, Sporty, Solid Value though...",4,"I was very impressed with this car.  
Have searched for a few months..so no 
quick decision here. I like almost 
everything about it except for the cup 
holders up front, they actually overlap 
each other so only two cans can fit, no 
large cups, or at least not for the two 
of you!!  Pretty stupid design, what 
was up with that engineering quirk?  
Also, the middle of the radio/CD 
display is dark so some characters and 
numbers are unreadable.  I'm hoping 
this is simply a bulb burned out behind 
the display."
pontiac,bonneville,2000,Disappointed2, 08/12/2002,Disappointed,3,"Styling was underwelming.    
I appreciated the changes in the 
chassis. Interior is spacious and 
comfortable, the convience of the tire 
pump is great!  
Performance is adequate  (I am 
waiting for the GTO , next year) 
First problem  was electrical   took 
dealer 3 times to fix.  Verbal 
explaination of repairs, ""you don't 
want to know!"".
 Now have racheting noise in the 
steering I am told the car was 
bottomed out ... the ""Craddle"" is bent 
and the noise/popping we hear is 
body flex. 
We don't drive radically.  Even though 
there are signs of the undercarraige 
being scraped there is no way that 
we impacted anything hard enough 
to warp the Craddle."
pontiac,bonneville,2000,Jam K, 08/20/2002,Definitely Attitude,4,"This car has been superb regardless of 
the trouble spots.  At 1,400 miles the 
supercharger blew and took the engine 
with it.  The dealer was more 
concerned as to what caused the 
problem rather than just fixing it.  
The heads-up display was scrambling 
and needed replaced as well.  The 
StabiliTrak system is amazing and 
works well especially in the snow, 
although a sensor had to be replaced 
twice to keep it working.  Other minor 
annoyances were the A-pillar trim 
panel keeps coming loose, the sunroof 
needs tightened occasionally but never 
leaks.  Even still if you drive one 
you'd likely buy one!  Truly Luxury 
With Attitude!"

to console design. With the drivers 
seat up and forward you can hardly get

less than $200 maint. per year

am 6' 5"" tall and weigh in at 240 lbs. and find this car very comfortable driving 
it up to 16 hours at a time on trips across country.  Original tires still show 
little tread wear.  Every component of the car has operated flawlessly since 
delivery.  When car was first test driven, I reported defective seat belt sensor

fixed. Fan blower motor replaced, still 
chirps. Dealership trying to find 
clunking noise near glove box. Have 
installed a windshield and ""three

replaced, new brakes in less than 5000 
miles, makes popping noise all the 
time, front end will not stay in 
in-linement, Tire Rods has had to be 
replaced 4 times, Tires are to expense

1997 Lumina was!"
pontiac,bonneville,2000,JD11, 07/19/2003,I would have spent the money elsewhere,3,"Just not impressed with the vehicle.  
As mentioned in previous critiques, 
there are many little problems with it. 
There was no compressor/airconditioner 
put in the car when there should have 
been, right tire rod had to be replaced 
(25000 miles), now experiencing muffler 
problems (40,000 miles on car). IN 
addition, there is a continuous 
rattling behind the steering wheel. 
THese are problems that should not 
occur in a new car. Just a 
dissapointment"
pontiac,bonneville,2000,Josh, 01/29/2005,Its alright,4,"this car looks very nice, looks a little like a race car. However I have had problems with this car also, struts make noise when you turn the wheel, outside temperture gauge, fog light switch, And even the passenger leather seat heater burnt a hole in the seat!! And drivers heating element burnt out completely, looks nice but if you plan on owning this car for a long time, dont dream of it. This car is only 3 years old, and I cant imagine whats going to go wrong next in another 3 years."

miles include lose headliner, sunroof 
track misaligned, leaking window, power 
window broke, cracked speaker, numerous 
door rattles, ignition switch replaced, 
manifold gasket leak, replace tie rod 
ends, replace steering shaft.  Now at 
38,000 the transmission is acting up.

of rattles & squeaks plus a lot of 
front end difficulties. Now they tell 
me the drive shaft is shot and needs 
replacement. Some strut squeaks and 
woes thrown in for good measure. 
Replaced brakes (new) make a lot of

driving home from the dealer suspension

Engine kept stalling while driving - 
bad crank sensor (towed 3 times before 
diagnosed)
Engine soft plugs poped while driving
Steering column was replaced twice.
Door panel replaced twice
Seatbelt mechanism rattled and squeaked.
Transmission failed after 38 months and 
27000 miles.
Now exhaust flange has cracked (no 
impact marks per dealer - it just 
failed)
Dealer and GM have been great in fixing 
the clunker - it just my time that is 
wasted and nerves that are being 
wracked."

Now the supercharger is dying, and there is a strong vibration during acceleration that no dealerships can seem to figure out. Also, the car is rusting in spots. "
pontiac,bonneville,2000,Snitz, 10/23/2005,For the dad who still likes excitement,4,"I bought it new and got a 7/100K warranty that pd for itself.  Great mileage and fun to drive.  Typical American maintenance.  That is why they lose their value quickly.  But I knew this going into the deal.  No serious problems with car.   I think a fifth gear would be nice and a little more grumble from the exhaust. An aftermarket battery should be made available.  As of now, you go to the dealership.  It is either all or nothing with the stereo system too.  Modular aftermarket components would be a nice option for upgrades.  The leather is not up to Toyota standards and they do get hot in the summer.  More front passenger leg room.  The dash lights up like a cockpit (really like that!)."

Now The passenger side window won't roll up the back window won't roll down, but it falls down.  My headlights have started flashing on and off so I can't drive at night.  My windshield wipers work intermittently.  And my Traction, Anti-Lock, and Brake light all have come on at the same time. My warranty has run out.  I took the car to an auto electric shop and he said I would need all four window regulators which are over 300.00 dollars a piece. That's just the beginning.  Anybody want to buy a car?  "

pontiac,bonneville,2000,David Craig, 06/01/2006,Excellent Fun Vehicle,5,This car handles like a dream - love to take it on curvy roads. The power is awesome and has great fuel economy when driving normally. Get lots of compliments on the exterior still (2006). Like that there are very few of these on the road and it has outrun anything I have raced against. The interior is very roomy and comfy. Love the dash and lighting design.
pontiac,bonneville,2000,slnews, 06/03/2006,Pre-Retirement Thrill,4,"In my search for a comfortable, roomy car for a big and tall person like myself, the Bonneville was last on my short list. After driving it, I had to have it!  Deceivingly roomy, yet drives and performs outstandingly. The creature features are just enough to pamper me but not too much to spoil me. I'd rather have a responsive ""big"" car in today's deteriorating roads, jam packed with inattentive (aka cell phone handicapped) drivers.  The 3.8 liter V6 is the perfect bridge between typical 3.5's and less that cars around this weight class usually get, and the gas guzzling V8's. I don't know if it's on purpose, but Pontiac dual exhausts have always ""growled"", which you won't hear in a Buick!"

I relented.  Now I wouldn't trade it 
off and hope to put 200,000 miles on 
it.  I now have 120,000 miles on it 
and have had very little wrong with 
the car.  The cup holders are somewhat 
small and I do hate the battery behind 
the back seat. Under warranty, the 
alternator had to be replaced but 
really has worked great since.   
Handling is a major plus!  And the car

Dealer replaced at their cost, but forgot a few bolts during the repair. Yup fluids all over the engine and driveway. Rear window came off the track 2x's. Sunroof was completely replaced(glass and all) because of wind noise. Wonderful steering noise started just after 39k miles(sorry warranty done). After that my ignition key doesn't always want to turn (happens to both of my keys), and leaves the million dollar question- will it start today. 2 alternators later and 4 weeks after the last one car died again.

Took a while but figured out it was the crank sensor, but also within having the car a week I had to replace, front struts, back shocks,both control arms, both sway bars, latterall links in the back, the fuel pump, and the ignition. This car was beautiful but it killed me money wise. Also rack and pinion was bad and was going to change it only to find out the rear end was rusted to the point that only the floor boards were holding it together!I bought another and also has the same front shake, anybody know why?Also window prob."

pontiac,bonneville,2001,My pontiac, 11/28/2010,my pontiac,4,"I bought this 2001 Pontiac Bonneville because I wanted a sporty family sedan I had a Mitsubishi diamante and let me tell you I've read some these reviews with problems with the Bonneville well go own a Mitsubishi. those cars were problems from the beginning my Bonneville currently has 140,000 miles on it I had to replace the catalytic converter other then that the cars dependable for me only thing it lacks is speed it seems slow but it is a big car I didn't think I'd ever own an American car I'm more of a foreign car owner but I thought I'd give it a shoot and haven't regretted it yet I wouldn't buy another American car again but I will keep this Bonneville running for as long as possible"
pontiac,bonneville,2001,Troyboy, 12/05/2007,Nice car,4,"This car is a great car, nothing wrong with it at all. I bought the cheap kind with the cloth seats and nothing fancy, get the nicer stuff, it's so much better, my cousin has one and its great. Engine though is unbeatable, had it until about 140,000 miles and would have kept it alot longer but I hit a deer. Great crash safety! I hit the deer going 80, and it didnt even scratch me! Great car will never let you down!"
pontiac,bonneville,2001,mightymouse75, 07/03/2012,Bonneville's are the BEST,4,"This is my third Bonneville.
I love them.
The SLE model with leather and heated seats and moonroof and remote start and the list goes on.
I have owned it since 149,000 miles and now have 190,000 4 years later.
GREAT car.
Now I finally need valve cover gaskets.
Not too shabby.
I would buy another in a heartbeat.
If you are considering one just do carfax and see what problems ""it"" has had.
If it looks clean, then buy it , you wont regret it!!!!!!!!!!"

I have had so many compliments on this vehicle that i cannot remember them all! I have had a few second looks as well. I'm very sad that the prodution of the Bonneville has ended. My goal now is to own the last Bonneville produced in 2005...the GXP!! I have had very few problams with my particular model...except for the fact my heated seats have both stopped working at exactly the same time, so if anyone else has had this problem, please let me know what the problem might be (example..a fuse or whatnot). I have owned the 1989 Bonneville, as well as 1999 Bonneville, and now the 2001 Bonneville! I'm happy!!"

The safety features are comforting. I took a TBone hit square in the driver side front door (i was crawling and she was traveling at 40 mph- and she never hit the brakes!) and my 10 yr old was in the front passenger seat-  neither my son nor I were hurt at all, the car's frame was not bent, the glass did not break - it was amazing. the traction control feature is amazing as well. if you hit the brakes in light rainy conditions and your wheels fail to grip properly, the car takes over and bumps the vehicle to a stop (no idea exactly how, but it has saved us a couple times!). Pontiac should resurrect production!"

LOVED the power and pep of the engine. but in a little over 30 days both back window motors broke at the same time. Then my gas and oil gauges quit working, the gas compartment hinge got stuck all the time, constantly replaced head/taillights, trunk leaked, transmission started shifting hard, had problems with front end alignment alot so new tires were needed more often than they shouldve been, front cv joint/axle replaced twice, and bc the gas gauge didnt work it constantly made the ""warning"" ringing sound. Was embarrased to be seen driving this. . .worst piece of crap ever!"

then countless converter replacements
then 2 coils replacements then A/C goes out then countless sensors replaced then front wheel bearings replaced and both tire rods replaced then front passenger window regulator goes out then water pump and raidtor repleaced had to replace the tension pully then valve cover gastets

pontiac,bonneville,2001,bonbon, 12/31/2007,Love/hate,4,"I bought my car new, it now has 131k. Very nice styling, very comfortable. I have gotten as high as 36mpg, but typically 20 around town, 30 on the road. Have had the same squeaks and rattles in the front passenger area since the car was new. Dealer could never find them. The ashtray would slide out, and after six times to dealer, fixed it myself. In the past year and a half, I have put in almost $5500 in repairs. My brother owned a Honda Accord with almost 225k, and he put in only $2000 worth of repairs in all that time. Reliability is very very poor, but this car is fun to drive. I am leaving GM after having two Pontiacs that have required excessive repairs. "
pontiac,bonneville,2001,njtravelguy, 01/25/2010,great car,5,I love this car. I consistently got 30 mpg on the highway.  It never broke down. The only repairs were the right front ball joint and broken motor mount. Unfortunately my car was hit on the side and the insurance company declared it a total loss.  Now I have to find a car.  I have had 3 Pontiacs and don't know what to get now.
pontiac,bonneville,2001,Dwayne, 11/20/2010,Pontiac-One of Detroit's best.,4,"I have owned this vehicle for four years now and I have had absolute no problems at all. I purchased my Bonneville with almost exactly 60,000 miles on it and was expecting some sort of major issues, but so far they have not occurred. I live in a Downtown Metro area and drive both city (and I mean gridlock city) and highway. My average MPG is 24 which is very manageable. This car has handled everything I have thrown at it and I couldn't ask for anything more quality wise. Very well rounded competent vehicle with a wonderful blend of sport and practicality."
pontiac,bonneville,2001,taybjay, 01/20/2003,Cool Car,4,"For the money a good value. 30 mpg on 
the highway is awesome. The ride is 
smooth and quiet. There are some 
squeaks and rattles that come and go 
which are annoying. Mostly from dash 
area. The 3800 motor is like an old 
friend. Always there when you need it. 
Spacious cabin and trunk are always a 
delight too."

this one stands out above all the 
rest.  I'm at 105,000 miles now and it 
still runs like it was new. It has 
required nothing but routine 
maintenance. Mine is a base SE model 
but there is plenty of power and the 
ride is nothing short of supple.  From 
my point of view it gives the Lexi, 
Audis, and BMWs that I pass on the 
highway a good run for their money, 
costs alot less and looks better.  
Great car!"
pontiac,bonneville,2001,cointoss, 08/11/2003,review,4,"Bought vehicle with 10000 miles on it, 
and over all very pleased. Have had 3 
small problems, of which one was a 
engine stopper(alternator went out). 
Nice to drive and smooth ride. I have 
put Toyo TPT tires on it and that has 
made a world of difference in 
performance and ride. Love the mpg--30 
on highway. Have 37000 on vehicle now 
and still is a great buy. No squeaks 
or comfort problems so far."

SE...and what a change!  Having 3 kids, 
we needed a car with lots of space - 
and still fun to drive.  This car does 
everying well - but not perfect (not 
sure anyone does).  There is lots of 
room, but the center rear seat is only 
good for the smallest child, the front 
seats are not as comfortable as first 
thought for a long drive, the auto down 
windows are a little two easy to 
activate (I am looking for issues 
here).  Overall though, I am immencely 
happy with this car, and one year from 
now, I think I will move from this used 
SLE, to a new SSEi - just to spice 
things up even more.  Considering a 
Bonne??  Go for it!"

pontiac,bonneville,2001,looked good, 09/16/2005,Transmission #3,3,"Bought this car because of the reputation of the engine and the gas mileage. It also looks fantastic. My only complaint is that I recently installed transmission #3. The original tranny was replaced at 55000, and now at 120000 I am replacing that one ($2600). The transmission shop said that these ""Bonnies"" have a weak tranny. "

pontiac,bonneville,2001,Brandyrn, 08/05/2010,Wouldn't trade for the world,4,"I love this car!  Problems, a few but overall meets all my expectations and have no reason to trade for a newer model.  I get 28 miles on the highway and 14 in the city.  I have all the options where most cars today have a few.  Power seats,10 disk changer,heated seats,heads up display,cd/tape player, onstar, you get the idea.  Chrome wheels were pretty but crap. Front lighter a waste but the car still looks new and rides great. Easily would buy another."
pontiac,bonneville,2001,Mark, 06/02/2005,Suoercharged fun,4,"Pontiac is the spirited style division of GM and this car shows it! If you don't love it you hate it. I love the style the SSEi brings to the table as well as it's spirited performance. The red glow of the cluster is on par with my BMW 540i and the interior offers more room for the family. MPG is over 27 when going 75ish on the interstate, but fall of fast when dipping in to the supercharger around town. All in all I wouldn't give up my BMW for it, but when I figured in the bang for the buck factor, I bought and love it. Another great alternative is the Buick Park Ave ULTRA. Same power train, but more laid back in design."

electrical problems for 2 months after 
I bought the car.  I had transmission 
problems at 42,000 miles.  Pontiac 
dealership fixed the problem.  Then, at 
45,000 miles the entire transmission 
had to be rebuilt.  Also, electric 
window motor on passanger side front 
has gone out.  Car reliablity is very 
poor!"
pontiac,bonneville,2001,Iffy, 01/19/2008,Choose Wisley,4,"This is a good but not great car. I bought it used a year ago and have had some problems.  2 of the windows went down, alternator left me stuck on the side of the road 100 miles from home and now the right front speed sensor is bad. Convert is plugged also. The car has good power and is fun to drive."
pontiac,bonneville,2001,Wayne, 09/08/2008,Solid car,5,"The engine is very good, with lots of power. Mine now has 147,000 with 28 mpg, no oil use between changes.  The plastic intake manifold cracked at 70,000, which did not happen in my 1989 Bonneville Series One 3.8 liter engine(going strong at 212,000), which had an iron manifold.  Other maintenance has been front wheel bearings at 140,000, and now the tranny started slipping at 147,000. The experienced mechanic who does mostly transmission work says the clutches go out at about 125,000.  $1,600 bill for the clutches and tightening the chain. GM dropped the ball when they ended the line.    "
pontiac,bonneville,2001,scothosw, 04/25/2002,Squeeks and rattles,4,"Purchased the brand new Bonnie over a 
Infiniti I30.  Mistake #1.  The car 
rides perfect, has lots of bells and 
whistles, and runs strong.  The problem 
I have is various squeeks from the 
door, a slight rattle in the dash, all 
of which you would not expect from a 
car that stickers over 34K.  I have had 
it in the shop 3 times the first 3 
months I owned it.  Water leaked into 
the trunk area when it rained.  Found 
out the drain holes were not drilled 
into the trunk lid from the factory.  
Alternator was bad after 2 months.  
Squeeks and rattles still not fixed in 
the door and dash after 2 trips in.  
Very typical GM car, plauged with 
squeeks and rattles."
pontiac,bonneville,2001,twostepper, 01/29/2009,Very Happy!,5,"Bought this car used and have been very satisfied. Gets great gas mileage.

pontiac,bonneville,2001,Wayne, 02/11/2009,buying foreign from now on,3,"Bought it used.  At 70,000 the plastic intake manifold cracked, at 140,000 front wheel bearings, at 141,000 a coil pack, at 145,000 another coil pack,at 149,000 MAF sensor, at 149,500 another MAF, at 149,550 a MAP sensor, and now the weakly designed tranny is slipping. It was a stylish and sporty design, but after 4 GM cars and a Dodge, my mechanic has a 401K with my name on it.  He even said that if everybody owned a Toyota, he'd be out of business, so I am going to do my part to help him retire. "
pontiac,bonneville,2001,Wayne, 02/20/2009,Diminishing reliability,3,"I bought the car used with 70,000 miles. Soon, it developed a cracked plastic intake manifold. It ran well, with few repairs until 140,000. In the past 10,000 miles, I have put over $2,200 in repairs into it, including front wheel bearings, several coil packs, a number of expensive electronic sensors, and I don't doubt the famously weak GM tranny will be next, at $1,600 to rebuild.  I wish I could go back a year and dump it for a Toyota.  Over the past 22 years, I have owned 4 GM cars and a Dodge, and I swear my mechanic owns a 401K with my name on it.   "
pontiac,bonneville,2001,Wayne, 01/19/2010,sharp car with dependability issues,4,"I love the exterior styling of this car, very sporty. NO idea why GM ended its production. It handles well. The 3.8 engine is very dependable, but all the other attachments to it seem to go out.  It started at 125,000 miles with a number of sensors, coil packs, alternator, starter, the plastic intake manifold, front ball joints, front wheel bearings, the list goes on.  The same with my old 1989 Bonneville, only that started at 75,000 miles.  And at 80,000 on my 1979 Pontiac Grand LeMans for that matter.  I finally started to buy Toyota for dependability sake.  GM may not have needed a bail out if they had adopted Toyota's model of quality control years ago. Daughter has it at college now."

I'm looking to sell.  The final straw 
was the transmission going at 38k.  
Pontiac had me pay $500 of the cost 
which to some people is nice, but I 
don't think the tranny should go at 1 
1/2 years!  The radio which shuts off 
when the car door opens, actually stays 
on 1/2 the time.  I've never been 
really comfortable with the design of 
the brake and gas pedal positions.  I 
don't know if it's because I sit in 
traffic alot and I'm tall, but it's a 
VERY uncomfortable design.    I'm 
pretty sure I'll never buy another GM 
again..."

to be replaced at 35,000 mile - most of
which are highway.  The Steering rack
had to be replaced at 44,000 miles and
GM offerd insignificant assistance. 
There is a TSB on the steering shaft,
but only if you know it is there will
they do the service. Rear Rotors have
failed at 44,000 mile.

I love the drive of the car, gm needs to
improve on the quality.

Lastly the sun roof had to be repaired
twice and finally replaced altogether."

fun to drive yet exceptionally 
comfortable. However, it performs so 
poorly in the snow even though I have 
ABS and traction control. The dealer 
says it is the size of the tires as I 
had no problems with my '94 and '97

With all my other GM models having the 3.8L, I have totaled over 650,000 mile on this engine model.  Typical 30 MPG, great acceleration and reliability.  Recommend using Mobil 1 10w30 and platinum plugs, drop the hood and drive.  The car has proven reliable, safe, and fairly enjoyable to drive. Currently has 150,000 on the car and plan to drive to at least 250,000.  Repairs to date: 3 brake sets, 1 transmission at 149K cost $1700 rebuilt, updated and installed, rear air shocks, 1 battery at 147K, heater motor and fuel sending unit, all the exterior lamps.

I've had 4 speed senors & fuel injectors put in, a new dash cluster which part of the lighting is burned out, a new radiator not to mention the master switch for the windows doesn't work, nor does the passenger mirror & driver side seat warmer. Hear comes the big one the engine is finished, over. But I love the car, what it stays for if that makes any sense. Otherwise, the car runs very well much power."

I really enjoyed driving it, but then the problems started popping up a few years later. True, it lasted over a decade without any major problems, but I don't think the car was meant to last more than 15 years or so. It's nice for someone who is just starting to drive. The accelerator is nice, especially with the V6 engine, but braking is a little sluggish, especially now that the rotors and pads are starting to become faulty. Doesn't take that much oil, which is nice, but with being about 20mpg and the dial for the gas tank being broken since 2014, you'll have to fill up about once every two weeks.

pontiac,bonneville,2002,Anonymous, 12/06/2010,Amazing Car!,4,"I bought my 2002 Pontiac Bonneville a few months ago, and absolutley love it. I owned a '91 Bonneville before, and was very suprised at how reliable the car was even with it's old age. I expected nothing less from my new one, and found that it is just as reliable. It is a very smooth  and comfortable ride. The car's V6 3800 engine gives it the kick one would expect, while maintaining that level of comfort that is needed for long car trips. It is a larger car, so as you could expect, it does not get the greatest gas milage. Like any car, it does have a few issues such as the leaky doors and trunk, the poping noice in the steering, and noicy exhaust. Other than that, it is an amazing car!"
pontiac,bonneville,2002,miket, 10/11/2006,Let Pontiac deal with this crap,2,"I purchased this car in October 2003 with 19,000 miles on it.  It now has 64,000, and I've had nothing but problems.  The reason for buying the car was that I wanted a large vehicle that didn't look like an ""Old man's"" car, and the fact that my uncle owned two Bonneville's previously with little or no mechanical problems.  Much to my dissapointment, this car has failed me miserably.  The first year wasn't too bad, because it was still under warranty.  I've always had a steering problem, with a slight knocking sound and ""bump"" felt when turning.  This has graduated to a whining noise.  Replaced the trans 3 months ago.  I could go on, but to hell with GM - tried Ford; looks like foreign now!"
pontiac,bonneville,2002,spytfyre13, 05/14/2008,Unhappy at this point,3,"My father bought this car and unfortunately he died 5 months after. I put car on the road 5 months later at 18,000 some miles in mar 05. Couple months later inside dome lights stopped working and battery died. Took it to dealer told them I thought there were electrical problems they said it was just a fuse, replaced battery. 3 months later inside dome lights quit working again. Awhile after that, driver side rear window just fell down one day. Passenger side front and rear power switches stopped working, heated seats stopped working and keyless entry alarm.  Now at 69,946 miles car has bad vibration in front end and gas pedal at high speeds usually 55 mph and up. Just replaced wheel bearing and helped "

pontiac,bonneville,2002,kt'sbonnie, 01/09/2006,Don't Buy New,3,"Bought used SE summer of 2004.  Avoided some of that massive depreciation.  Was a GM buyback because of water leak.  Dealer said window seal fixed problem but I took it in twice before they un- clogged door drain holes.  Water was coming in at bottom of door seal.  Seems to be fixed, but now that warranty is out interior light fuse has blown several times.  Concerning complaints about water in trunk, I've found that this gets in when the car is wet and trunk is opened.  Lot of wind noise on driver's side.  Firestone Affinity tires need help.  Otherwise car is comfy with a great engine and my transmission has worked fine."
pontiac,bonneville,2002,T. Wambaugh, 03/02/2007,My most reliable car...ever!,4,"I bought this car new four and a half years ago.  It now has 65,000 miles on it and all that it has required of me is to change the oil and filter.  The original tires, brakes, even windshield wipers are still installed.   The vehicle is garaged and run primarily on interstates at 60 to 80 mph.  It gets about 30 mpg on the interstate.  Around town, the mileage drops down to low to mid twenties.  Although the depreciation rate is fairly steep on this car the actual dollars depreciated are far less than my wife's 2003 Lexus.   The only complaint I have regards the Traction Control System; it is far to easy to spin the tires at take off on wet pavement."
pontiac,bonneville,2002,cyclone10, 12/24/2010,GOOD CAR,4,"I bought my Bonneville new in 2002. It is the best car I have ever owned. I have owned new Dodges and Fords.

pontiac,bonneville,2002,April, 08/06/2008,Attention Pontiac!!!,4,"I love my Bonneville but this car has issues.  Vibration in front end, popping noise in the steering, leaking doors, heated passenger seat stopped working and the trunk is leaking. I have had two new passenger side tie rod ends put on this car in 60,000 miles.  Pontiac you need to step up to the plate and take care of these issues."
pontiac,bonneville,2002,Martyev, 11/24/2008,No-More-GM,3,I have been a loyal GM owner my whole life (now 45) and this is my last GM product. It is no wonder they are in the trouble they are. I have owned my Bonneville for almost 3 years. I love the comfort and it's a very fun car to drive. But if you read my review and other we all have the same problems. Mine has a bad noise in the front suspension. Persistent leaks. The rear spoiler allows water to store in the trunk lid and you get wet when you open the trunk after a heavy rain. I also leaks at the driver door and the rear floorboard.  Had to replace a rear window motor and heated seat element failed.

There are many electrical problems, which is typical of Pontiacs. The lights for the controls on the dash work when they want to. Minus the electrical issues, I love this car. More than most Pontiacs. I am 22 and do not feel like I am driving a grandma car because the sporty styling makes up for it being a boat. "
pontiac,bonneville,2002,Chris J , 06/01/2009,Amazing,5,All the complaints dont define this car. Being a mechanic I know most of malfunctions are driver wear without maintnace. although there are somethings that just happen. the clunk noise in the front end is a strut plate the seals are just a litte flawed and owning many 3.8s the intake gaskets are only a matter of time. Fun to drive. Great gas mileage. Looks Sleek and has plenty of power and room if anyone complains about that tell them to get a mini van. Oh and one more thing. Start making them again !!!! 
pontiac,bonneville,2002,Longneck, 06/06/2002,I picked a good one...,5,"I am 6'6""/275 lbs.  I was surprised at 
how much room I have.  I like the 
acceleration and handling.  I drive 
country roads and the tracking is 
superb on the curves.  It gets hot down 
here in Texas, but the AC cools the car 
down very quickly.  The sound system is 
great, too.  So far, I am quite pleased 
and feel like I got a real bargain."
pontiac,bonneville,2002,oldwiz09, 02/07/2013,Very Quirky,3,"I'm experiencing the same problems as many of these reviewers. I've had 3 window regulators go bad and replaced them myself, which wasn't bad once I figured out how to remove the door panels. Interior lights frequently blow the fuse. Just replaced heater blower motor and resistor. Intermediate steering shaft bumps but tech bulletins say this poses no real problems. IP lights are slowly fading out. I have enjoyed owning this car overall but all these quirks make me want to never own another GM product."

With Goodyear Assurance tires (soft ride), rides like a Cadillac. nice mileage for a big car, decent handling, fairly peppy.  But - replaced lower intake manifold gasket twice ($700+ job), 1st time at 35,000 miles, 2nd at 95,000 miles. All 4 electric window units replaced, bad leaking problem, rain leaked into / under 3 of the doors and pooled on the carpeting.  8 trips to dealer. Moon roof was only used 15 times, then the linkage cracked and fell apart. $1200 to fix - I opted to seal it shut with gasket compound. Window washer motor replaced. A lot of rattles. My wife refuses to drive it.       "

fixed and have one rattle that I fixed -
 they couldn't get the job done at the

The car is comfortable and roomy - good 
sized trunk.  A good highway cruiser

this was the car for us.  The ride was 
incredibly smooth and quiet.  The 
handling just great.  BUT...the car was 
in the shop more than with me the first 
few months, due to trunk leaking, 
brakes squeeking, noise coming through 
front doors, CD playing going crazy, 
fuel pump rattling, headliner rattling, 
etc. Most of these problems have not 
been able to be corrected due to design 
problems or ""can't be duplicated"".  "

through the weather-stripping and 
streaming right down into the spare 
tire well.  The back passenger floor 
also gets wet when it rains, probably 
bad weather -stripping.  The driver's 
side window makes a groaning noise when 
I power it down. The car clunks when 
making turns.  I thought the clunk was 
due to the intermediate steering shaft

I'm being told it's a bad front strut 
bearings.   "

motor. My only problem so far is the 
left front suspension area keeps 
producing a popping noise during 
turning. The dealership has lessened 
the problem but can't seem to fix it. 
The 3.8L is a great reliable motor. My 
last one, a 1998 Olds Intr, had 98,000 
mi. in 3 years with no mechanical 
problems. The car performs great and 
looks great especially when you tint 
the windows and change rims."

first was a '96. I try to buy American 
products because I think it's 
important to this country's long term 
health. My '96 was 95% domestic 
(USA/Canada) while the '02 was 85%. I 
loved my '96 and when it was time to 
replace it, the choice was between 
the '02 and the '03. The price 
difference was less than $100 but GM 
made standard features in the '02 
optional in the '03. The '02 ended up 
being a much better value."

two complete brake jobs! Front end 
still vibrates when slowing down after 
having new tires installed! My biggest 
complaint is the interior design. The 
glove box is way too far under the 
dashboard to be of any use, which also 
makes the trunk release worthless. 
Head rests are also worthless. You 
have to lean your head way back just 
to make contact with them. I doubt if 
they would even provide support in a 
rear collision. Console arm rest is 
too high. Front seat backs keep coming 
apart if my children push their feet 
on them because they are only held in 
place by some kind of track system 
that clips together. "
pontiac,bonneville,2002,jesse 97, 07/28/2004,Don't but this car,4,"This is an ok car but i wouldn't 
recommend buying it.  I have had many 
problems with it.  I had to get new 
front brake rotors at 20,000 miles and 
now the brakes are squeaking.  The 
3.8L engine has a lot of power but it 
seems like the transmission is holding 
it back.  The engine also runs very 
rough and is very loud, but when you 
are inside the car you can't hear 
anything.  I also think the car has 
horrible handleing.  The interior of 
the car is very comfortable except for 
the headrests and head room.  I don't 
like leather so the cloth seat option 
was nice."

It has required no major repairs and still runs smooth after 100,000 miles. Regular oil changes are the best investment you'll ever make in your car. I only wish Pontiac still made them so I could buy another. Guess I'll have to settle for a G6."
pontiac,bonneville,2002,Tom, 09/11/2007,There are reasons they stopped making it,3,"Water still leaks into car during heavy rain storms despite 10 trips to different dealers and numerous contacts with the Pontiac folks. Back of front seats had to be replaced-they fell apart on their own, as did the rear window regulator assemblies (both within two days, $530 each). Wires fell down from behind the dash and had to be replaced along with defective lights. Firestone tires stink-two blow outs at lower speeds and Firestone dealers will not honor warranty (similar problems with Saturn I had previously). Then there's the normal irritants such as an ash tray that rattles constantly, and the lug nut caps that keep flying off (the dealers want $6 each, junk yards sometimes are free)."

it. I bought it used and fill that it 
is like a brand new car. Love the 
styling and the ride. For such a big

will only own bonnevilles from now on.

We have problems with the sunroof leaking, the windshield leaks, the control for the heated seats doesn't work. We had it replaced twice. The steering wheel has a hang in it when turning left.

is a lot of fun if you drive under 60 
mph. At high speeds, the vibration 
will liquify your brain. The dealer 
has put three sets of tires on, 
replaced the front lower control arms, 
and road force balanced the tires at 
least six times. He now claims it is 
within GM specs, but the vibration is 
awful. Apparently, GM dose not have 
very high expectations for their cars."

a 1993 Bonneville SSE with more than 
140,000 miles.  Great improvement over 
a previous great car.  Only minor 
gripes are with the head rests which 
are set too far back to provide best 
protection and comfort, and the 
inability to see into the glove 
compartment.  You just fish blind to 
find anything stored there."

far the best car I have ever driven!!  
It is extremely fun to drive!  It 
handles well and responds when you 
press the pedal unlike other cars that 
I have driven.  With it being low to 
the ground it is also safer to drive as 
I found out when I hit a patch of wet 
pavement with my last Bonneville 
(balding tires my fault)and spun off 
the road (at 70mph) but the car and 
passengers were quit safe.  My first 
Bonnevillewas over 200,000 miles when I

But, after owning this vehicle for less than 1 year, I got a vibration in the front end that was so made it would make your butt numb. Literally. I have had it in the dealership at least 15 times and have replaced the tires. No help. I also have an issue with losing power. Completely and without warning. The dealership cannot find a problem. It just won't start for a day or two. And then it does. I too have had issues with the steering column and Idler Arms needing to be replaced. I agree, owning this vehicle will cause you to know your Service Advisor much too well. Very disappointing and very frustrating.    "

Well, I am at 196K+ and I have only changed the oil. Very reliable and still strong even though it is a senior citizen mileage wise.

I drive it hard and still get 22 MPG on EVERY tank. That is an accomplishment because I burn gasoline...lol!

Bonneville SSEi which is on the same 
platform as the Seville and $20,000 
less.  This is a better driving and 
riding car than its higher priced 
sister.  It does lack a few options, V-
8, rear heated seats, wood trim, and 
the Cadillac mystic, but the super-
charged engine is a great performer and 
let's face it, the Cadillac mystic is 
not worth $20,000. See what the

and quick reflexes. The 
suspension/steering package hold 
this vehicle squarely and 
securely on the road even in hard 
cornering, but leaves a smooth ride and 
feeling of control. The styling is 
contemporary and makes a stunning 
visual from any angle. The 3.8L V-6 
automatic is smooth and moderately 
torquey, but can snap the car cleanly 
and quickly down the highway if need 
be. The instrumentation is easy to 
read at a glance and all controls can 
be accessed without leaning from the

pontiac,bonneville,2002,Gene - Massachusetts, 04/23/2006,Great Car,4,"Having been in a Grand Prix GTP I got used to the power of the supercharged 3800.  This car is equally impressive and maintains 26+ MPG highway if I behave. Good traction ... 60K miles on original tires.  Leaking spoiler (3 times to dealer)a nagging issue with no other quality issues. Brakes replaces after 24K and I am not hard on them.  Dealer said it's normal for this car.  Good stlying, comfortable on highway and a blast on side roads.  Looks like Pontiac is moving to smaller sized cars so being a big guy this may be my last Pontiac unless they change their focus.  High end stereo and all the goodies make this a fun car to own. Great tire wear ! Some balance issues as tire wear though."
pontiac,bonneville,2002,C&C, 04/10/2004,From a hardcore Pontiac person,3,"Being in to old collector Pontiacs as 
my primary hobby, I thought I would try 
a new one. My wife drives this car 
everyday and loves it!! My biggest 
concern so far has been 2 window 
motors,intake gaskets,steering 
shaft,seat cover and rear seat divider 
panel in 20 K miles. This is excessive 
for any car. Hopefully Pontiac will get 
back on ""track"" soon. "
pontiac,bonneville,2002,john729, 07/28/2004,Don't but this car,4,"This is an ok car but i wouldn't 
recommend buying it.  I have had many 
problems with it.  I had to get new 
front brake rotors at 20,000 miles and 
now the brakes are squeaking.  The 
3.8L engine has a lot of power but it 
seems like the transmission is holding 
it back.  The engine also runs very 
rough and is very loud, but when you 
are inside the car you can't hear 
anything.  I also think the car has 
horrible handleing.  The interior of 
the car is very comfortable except for 
the headrests and head room.  I don't 
like leather so the cloth seat option 
was nice."

is awsome.  Not only does it look 
cooler than most other sedans. It also 
rides and performs great.  The only 
problem we have had in the first 14,000 
miles came with the car new.  The Panel 
behind the back seat, which is located 
in the trunk, fell off because the

I get 25 +/- MPG on the highway and 18 +/- in town. Handling is excellent and response is as well. I do have a few complaints ... a persistent leak on the rear spoiler allows water to store in the trunk lid and you get wet when you open the trunk after a heavy rain. The brake pads needed to be replaced after only 24,000 miles and again at 50,000.  The tires - Goodyear Eagle RSA's are the original tires ... outstanding.  Had to replace a rear window motor and heated seat element failed. All the problems have been annoying and should NOT have happened to a top of the line car. Overall a great car"

I still have the car and it's still going strong with 168,000 miles. The only thing i have had to do with it is scheduled maintenance (oil changes, balancing tires, etc). Fuel economy is great for a 6 cylinder. It has a very smooth ride, and i like the comfortable leather seats. It also rides quite well at 120 mph. One of the only things i do not like about this car is that it is quite heavy, and does not stop as quickly as many other cars I have driven."

Besides routine things, I never had work done on it. It got great gas mileage on the highway and was a smooth comfortable ride. I recently totaled it when we got a snow storm but I walked away completely fine! It still drove and the engine sounded fine but a lot of body damage was done. I'm looking into getting another bonnelville. Great cars! Very roomy (especially the trunk)

Then came the the transmission not engaging 1st. I had the transmission replaced, it worked fine for about 5 months. Now it is doing the exact same thing. It also has an annoying steering grind.  I would not recommend this car. I have also heard others complaining of transmission problems with this car."

squealing acceleration off the line, 
none of that ""240 hp"" that only comes 
10 minutes into driving it up to 10,000 
rpm.  Instant power.  The interior is 
comfortable, but the headrest is a 
little odd - it supports my head only 
when tilted forward.  Love the heads up

After 2 new sets of Michelin tires, countless tire balances, alignments, badly warped rotors at 43,000 miles, sticking calipers, drivers seat that shifts when taking curves, and 2 fixes to the steering column, we still have bad vibration, brake problems, and a seat that shifts - to the tune of about $3000.  Oh yes, also had water coming in from under the car as well as in the trunk. I hate this car!  GM will not get another sale from me. "

pontiac,bonneville,2003,josh4488, 05/21/2003,Another floater from GM,3,"1) Horrible handling. No on-center 
feel, wanders (with correct 
alignment); rolls heavily and non-
linearly (including over its 
sidewalls); steering has super-weird 
feel while accelerating hard. Brakes 
warped in less than 10K mi.

2) Slow. Geared incredibly high 
(second gear can take you well over 
100 mph), so there's little off-the-
line power. Above 55 mph the car 
refuses to downshift into second - 
feels slow at almost every speed.

3) Junky interior. Bad plastics. The 
steering wheel has a squishy feel to 
the humps at 10 and 2. Buttons look 
haphazardly placed. Steering wheel 
obscures gauge cluster."

once it gets up and going. The SSEi 
suspension is pretty nice on more 
demanding roads, but you do have to 
remember this is a LARGE car and it 
doesn't handle like a sports car. The 
tires howl when you push it hard, but 
it is well behaved and easy to drive.  
Acceleration is powerful, but not 
quick.  The leather interior is very 
quiet and comfortable. Adult rear seat 
passengers rave about the ride and room 
in the back seat.  If price is no 
object, you can get better, but at this

country roads.  A couple of 
complaints:  Mine doesn't get 29 on the 
highway (lucky to get 24). A friend 
tells me he gets 29 or 30 on the 
highway with his SLE. I wish it had the 
room of the Chrysler cars.  I'm 6'4, my 
wife is tall, and so are my kids.  For 
that reason, I should have looked more 
seriously at the 300 or Intrepid (tons

well built vehicle."

I'm getting almost 24 mpg in mixed (city/hwy) driving. The reliability is exceptional! I simply love this car! I am also very disappointed that GM has discontinued producing the Bonneville (as of the 2005 model year). I will drive this car for quite a long time. In fact, my plan is to drive this car for at least another 5 years, then look for a clean 2005 Bonneville GXP and be in Bonneville Heaven! (I know the 2005 GXP is the best ever!!)"

so, then this is the car. The engine 
sound is amazing. As soon as you open

its really gives you a rush. When test

space does not let me miss my SUV.  
Don't let the name ""Bonneville"" mislead 
you.  It is not the big old bug car."
pontiac,bonneville,2003,CACruising, 05/29/2003,"Blast to drive, very happy with this car",4,"This car is a blast to drive if you 
like a car with power that handles 
well.  The suspension gives a great 
ride for long and short trips.  To 
eliminate some expensive options that 
we did not want (12-CD, Satellite 
radio, chrome wheels and sun roof 
because of head clearance), we ordered 
the car.  It arrived in 4 weeks.  Had a 
water leak problem with trunk through 
the bolt holes that hold Spoiler.  It 
was fixed after a couple of tries."
pontiac,bonneville,2003,jandres, 06/23/2003,2003 Bonneville SLE,5,"The moment I sat in this car for the 
first time I was hooked. The cockpit 
reminded me of a jet airplane. Being an 
engineer, I loved the controls and 
layout of the interior (especially the 
instrument panel). The ride and power 
of the engine are exceptional for this 
size of car. Lots of room in the back 
and very comfortable. I opted for the 
leather seats. Ride and handling are 
superb. This car is a gem.

BTW, Some complain about the lower body-
side cladding. I believe it is a plus 
since it protects the lower part of the 
car against stone chips and door dings."
pontiac,bonneville,2003,Larry Stevens, 05/16/2008,My 2003 Bonne,4,"Overall I would rate this a good buy!  It has performed better than expected.  The only problem is something that just came up in the last 6 months which my dealer calls ""knuckling,"" which is when you turn the wheel you experience a ""grinding"" sound.  I am told that GM has no solution for this which is a great disappointment to me."
pontiac,bonneville,2004,evnsptc, 10/27/2013,Hey It's A Pontiac! What Can I Say?,4,"I ordered this car brand new to my specifications (Cranberry Red, Tan Heated Leather, Moonroof, Monsoon Audio, 12 Disc CD Player, otherwise came with everything standard) This car is my absolute favorite out of the 4 Pontiac's I own (00' GP GT sedan, 01' GP GTP Special Edition Coupe, 04' Bonny GXP and 07' GP GT) It by far has the best steering/braking/suspension! The 4.6L Northstar V8 is super powerful but leaves me with a little more power being desired (Because of the fact that GM has the 2.0T and 3.6L which make about the same power). The exhaust sound is magnificent. I don't even know where to start about the looks of this car because it is super hot! Mine has 27K miles and is reliable."
pontiac,bonneville,2004,John Wellauer, 08/14/2007,If Only...,4,"This has been a nice car to drive over the past three years. It has decent pickup and great road manners. It is quiet and has a smooth, comfortable suspension setup  without excessive body roll in turns. The dual zone HVAC is a dream, always ready to make you absolutely comfortable no matter the weather outside. If I were to have any complaints about this car it would be the ill advised Intermediate Shaft in the steering column carried over from the Olds Aurora.  When your GXP becomes afflicted with this malady you are stuck suffering through moans, groans and a stiff feel in tight turns; and a notchy ""hitting a rock"" feel in normal driving turn situations. This car depreciates quickly."
pontiac,bonneville,2004,balckgxp, 02/18/2006,Love my GXP,4,"Great car. Lots of room, has lots of power.  Really comfortable....no major problems.  Northstar V8 is great."

and oil changes at local dealer"
pontiac,bonneville,2004,Matt, 06/01/2010,Love it,4,"I did a lot of research about this car before I decided to buy. Great ride and drive. Seats are as comfy as you will find.

pontiac,bonneville,2004,shakenbake88, 11/24/2013,Always been a GM guy,3,"IMHO i would stay away from these cars as they are nothing but an electrical nightmare.
The car is less then 9 years old and have spent ridiculous amounts of coin on it.
The computer was replaced, and programmed by dealer, with less then 120,000 km. and i still have the engine light going off.
Dropped the transmission with less then 160, 000 mostly highway kms. Cracked the plastic plenum on the the engine with just over 130, 000km.
Who thought of that, plastic on top of a hot engine! The design flaws are endless. I scrapped it, and took the money that I would have spent repairing it, and bought new wheels.

The cluster has stopped working on all three of them. My transmission fell out at 42,000 miles. I have had other problems as well. I paid a lot of money for my car and feel like I was cheated.

Lexus or Audi?  No.  A perfomance machine 
equal to a BMW?  No.  But for the price, the 
size, the features, it's hard to beat.  It turns 
heads, the engine is wonderful, and it's 
American. I don't need the glitz of a German 
badge.  This one suits me just fine, thank

1995, 2000, and 2004), which is the 
best yet. New sping and shock rates 
have made the ride as stiff an my 1999 
MB C280 Sport. Great chassis, with good 
overall braking and straight-line 
numbers enable this offering to be a 
value class leader. My dealer (Perrine) 
is oustanding, which makes me want to 
buy from them. All in all, a great 
value in the $30,000 price range. "
pontiac,bonneville,2004,Tymbrewood, 07/05/2004,The New Bonneville,4,"I've owned a 77, 78, 93 and 94 
Bonneville.  By far, this 2004 GXP is 
a huge leap forward in performance, 
safety and design compared to what's 
already come along.  Mine has all the 
options, and handles beautifully.  
Acceleration is phenomenal, and 
braking power is fantastic.  The GXP 
stays glued to the road, and I feel 
very confident driving in a downpour 
(had my chance to check for leaks - no 
leaks!) The instrument panel and dash 
have a huge wow! factor at night, and 
the headlights really reach out for 
quite a distance.  I've already put 
over 800 miles on it in 6 days, mostly 
highway miles, and simply love the car."

crimson tintcoat paint is a sure 
winner, and the leathe rinterior is 
extremely comfortable and spacious."
pontiac,bonneville,2004,Jim, 03/03/2008,Good car but needs a recall for steering,4,Car has plenty of power whenever needed. Gas mileage is consistantly at 28 MPG highway & 22 MPG city. Would recommend if steering problem fixed.
pontiac,bonneville,2004,sleddriver, 11/30/2007,Long Live the Bonneville!,4,"I have owned this vehicle for less than 2 months (42,000 miles at purchase) and have already put 5,000 miles on it.  (I have a '95 LeSabre that has 173,000 miles on it, and it is still running well.)  I purchased it for less than half its original invoice, and it was virtually brand new. I'm no engineer, but the 3800 Series II engine is the best GM auto engine around. This sled drives like a go kart!  Road feel and steering reponsiveness is incredible compared to the Buick. (Reminds me of the old Tiger Paw commercials.) Pontiac is winning me over every time I drive the Bonneville.  Should the G- 8 live up to expectations, I will be ordering one as the '12 models arrive in about 4 years."

I traded an 02 Monte Carlo in for this car and quite honestly wasn't expecting to have the super fun that the MC afforded me but after driving this car for the last two weeks, let me assure you that it is MORE fun than MC, the longer wheel base must be the difference. Great acceleration, nice cornering, comfortable seating and my family of four fits in very nicely. Had a 92 Grand Prix for years and loved it, but I don't think I'll buy anything but Bonneville's from here on out!"
pontiac,bonneville,2004,balckgxp, 09/09/2005,Great fun car to drive,4,"This is a great car for the money.  Much less than any comprable import.  Very large and roomy.  Handles great with lots of power.  Has 275 hp V8.  Highly recommend the car, great value"
pontiac,bonneville,2004,JPM101, 09/26/2005,A Seville by any other name,5,"A Seville by any other name... still rides as sweet - after removing the stock Firestone tires and replacing with Goodyear Assurance ComfortTreads. After driving 2005 Impalas, Park Avenues, and Honda Accord EX, I chose the 04 Bonneville for it's comfort, gadgets, moonroof, XM stereo, wide stance stability and heavy car feel. I drive a very curvy road at freeway speeds to and from work. The car sticks like glue now that I installed the new tires. The Firestones only had 12,000 miles on them and were down to 7/32 all the way around (they were noisey and slippery) the difference is like night and day. I drove this car on a 2,000 mile trip to Oregon and back with absolute comfort."
pontiac,bonneville,2004,Mr. Bonneville, 02/02/2004,GXP,4,"This car is really fun to drive. It's 
performance is very good since its a 
V8. The horsepower is a little too weak 
for a 4.6L V8, but the 300 twisting 
pounds of torque make up for that. The 
only bad thing is the 17/24 city/Hwy 
mileage. Overall, I think Pontiac put a 
lot of effort into this smooth ride and 
it handles pretty good. I love the 
brakes."

knocking noise when steering, 
especially turning. Leather is ripping

ago. It was delivered with rusted brake 
rotor hubs that look like they came out 
of a scrap yard.  If they are going to 
use these new style, very open wheel 
designs, they need to treat the brake 
hardware so that it doesn't rust like 
crazy.  Also, the chrome plated 
aluminum rims have chrome bubbling and  
flaking off the clearly visible inside 
diameters. Dealer has ordered 4 me new 
wheels. This is shameful. The A/C cools 
erratically for the first 2 or 3 miles 
of driving. And this car came from the 
GM plant that JD Power rated the best 
in North America!!  How can that be????"

So, given that this is a free car for me, I'm happy with it. It has a very comfortable and predictable ride (which is useful in snow/ice). I know what I'm getting from the Bonny - its just what I'm NOT getting that I miss. What I'm not getting is what Pontiac pretends to have different than the rest of GM ... namely performance. The Bonny's no dog; but with such a mean- sounding exhaust and the potential for American muscle, this Bonny should have more power behind it. Add more power and a more aggressively designed new one for all classes (not just GXP) & I'll be happy to drive another one!"
pontiac,bonneville,2004,Jim, 05/19/2005,"Good To Go, Go, Go",4,I love my GXP.  It has that deep V-8 sound  and has the get up and go to match.  Plenty of room for 5 fullsized adults and lots of trunk space.  Great for the long hauls to Vegas baby.  
pontiac,bonneville,2004,Jay Francis, 05/24/2005,Very Very Pleased,4,"The great thing about the Bonneville, although I am sure GM won't like to hear this, is that it depreciates quickly, such that you can pick up a lot of car for not very much money if you buy used.  I am very happy with this car.  It does everything I expect of a car. Interior...the well around the console has a plastic that will tear easily, they could have done a better job. Also, although I haven't experienced it with this Bonneville, you have to be aware of a GM flaw with a failing head gasket that allows water into the engine. It's a quiet enough car, I put on the new Goodyear Assurance tires.  Stereo system is good. The Bonneville cost me $17,000 used, with leather interior w/ 10,000 mi"
pontiac,bonneville,2004,Mark, 08/19/2005,The Last Bonneville,4,"Good looking Bonneville GXP, simplified, clean lines, SE & SLE should follow suit. Smooth, fast, quiet, excellent suspension, holds the road beautifully, though steering is a bit numb.  If you want a true full- sized car (and no, Acura TL is not full- sized), and you are partial to American muscle, and sentimental over Pontiac, get a GXP.  The sticker shock is worth it.  Chrysler 300 Hemi is faster, but tries too hard to look like a Bentley.  "

pontiac,bonneville,2005,Chris Hasen, 09/17/2018,"Expensive to Maintain, But Worth It.",4,"My dad was a Bonneville guy since the 90's; He's owned at least 3 of them. As a kid, I thought his 2000 Bonneville SE was the coolest car ever. So when in 2004 the GXP model was released, I always dreamed of owning one. 13 years later, I finally got my dream car. This car is just as good as I imagined it would be and then some. Sounds great, drives great, and the styling has held up really well. Every drive in this car is extremely rewarding. I look forward to my commute in it because it's such a blast, even in traffic. All this comes at a price,though, and that is the engine. Head gaskets are usually the most notorious thing to go wrong with this motor, but I actually had an issue where the timing chain broke, causing catastrophic engine failure. Dealers will charge an arm and a leg for their work, and goos luck finding a shop that wants to work on a Northstar. The good news is that the car is an H-body, which means the rest of the mechanical bits and bobs should be a lot easier to service. Body panels like bumpers, headlights, taillights, are unique to the GXP and are extremely hard to find and those on the used market are rather expensive for what they are. Overall, this car is a pain in the butt to own, but I wouldn't trade it for the world. I would only recommend owning this car if you really want it. It might not be the perfect car to you, but it is to me, and I wouldn't have it any other way.
"
pontiac,bonneville,2005,D J McCue, 10/12/2010,Love this car,5,"Bought this GXP in Feb 2005; actually bought it for my wife; not only does she love it , but I like to drive it; I grew up in the muscle car era and this reminds me of it. Love the Northstar V8. The car has been very reliable with decent mileage considering the power available City 14.5/Highway about 23. Love the HUD, memory driver features(seats & mirror, plus radio. Ours is Black with Grey interior; it's a real head turner. The car is garage kept and has very low mileage (driven to/from grocery store by a little old lady; we are in our late 60s). Her previous car was a 1996 T-Top Camaro RS, with 3.8L V-6, also low mileage, 10 years, 34,000. We plan on keeping the GXP a Long time!"
pontiac,bonneville,2005,clevelandbonneville, 09/13/2010,"love it - style, performance, economy",4,This car is great. I bought with 90K. It now has 102K. I love the style. Very stylish car. Its big!! Its comfy. It has a very quiet cabin. The gm 3.8 is an amazing engine. Actually got 30 mpg when doing a highway trip of 480 miles. with 16 gallons of gas. It has a big gas tank at 18 gallons. Don't need to fill up much. Normal MPG is about 25 with highway/city mix and not winter out.  One problem it died on me on the freeway. Kinda scary. It was the Mass airflow sensor. It happened out of nowhere. No engine lights. I would replace this at 100k miles or sooner. That's when it died on me. Besides for that no problems. You can probably have autozone replace for you.
pontiac,bonneville,2005,andacious, 12/17/2014,Love-Hate Relationship,3,"To start, I love Bonnevilles. I owned a '98 Bonnie all through high school and college and it served me well. Bought this GXP once I graduated, and its definitely a love-hate relationship. As far as style, this car has it. Interior, exterior, handling, performance - all fantastic. However, the biggest issue I have with this car is the reliability. I bought it with 64k on it and in 2.5 years I'm at 83k and have put over $8,000 worth or repairs into it (I have a warranty). There is no way that it should need this many repairs when its just a daily driver with less than 10k a year."
pontiac,bonneville,2005,jdkan1, 10/27/2009,"Awesome Vehicle, Bring it back!",5,"Well, about one month after we purchased the car, it had a recall on a steering linkage. Since then (it now has over 100,000 miles on it) it is going strong. Good mileage (20 in town 29 on the road). Bullet proof 3800 Series II engine. Only the normal wear and replace things such as tires and brakes. We just did the first tune up and are getting ready to replace shocks, struts, coolant flush and refill, new surpentine belt and transmission service, hope for another 100,000 out of it! One of the best cars we've ever owned for durability and comfort."
pontiac,bonneville,2005,clevelandbonneville, 04/07/2010,Amazing underrated car,4,"So far owned for 3,000 miles. I got this beautiful car for a bargain price with 90k miles. It drives like it has 30k miles. I've gotten between 23 and 27 mpg per tank so far. Nothing has broken except for a burned out head- light bulb. Very smooth torquey engine with silky smooth shifting transmission. Lots of style. More style than all the imports for sure. I love the look from the back and side especially. Only cool Chryslers and Dodge's have more style but they are troublesome. This car feels heavy and well-built and safe. Nice looking interior with a large trunk and back seat. This car is big and a bit tricky to maneuver in parking lots and city but its a dream on the freeway. "
pontiac,bonneville,2005,DMP, 03/19/2009,Great Bonnie!,4,Purchased as a demo in 2007 with 21K kliks as a replacemennt for my 94 SLE (nice car); Now at 53K. Daily driver for mostly city driving. I love the styling - stealth-look black exterior turns heads and clears traffic on the highway. Interior is comfortable for my tall frame. Excellent ride. The GXP is very thristy; in keeping with the performance image the final drive was raised to 3.7 which drops the mileage by about 20% over other NorthStar equipped cars. 
pontiac,bonneville,2005,Sonny, 02/19/2008,Review,4,"My GXP is a head turner with wht/gold tricoat paint.  Fuel economy is poor in city driving, but performance and styling outweighs this big gas guzzling sedan."
pontiac,bonneville,2005,mary ann, 07/21/2008,Only Bonnevilles for me! Bring it back!,4,"I had a 1995 Bonneville that I loved.  I was getting to the point of considering a newer car and when I heard they were discontinuing the Bonneville, I had to track a leftover down!  I love my 2005.  It has the coolest interior - a cockpit style and it very comfortable to drive.  I have to make a lot of 6 hour round trip drives and I love my Bonneville!  I keep my cars about 10 years so I hope by 2016, they're making Bonnevilles again - without changing a lot about them!"
pontiac,bonneville,2005,jolaine wagg, 06/15/2005,bonneville,4,"This car handles the road well, corners nicely.It is a beautiful riding car and very comfortable. Fuel economy is good for a V8."
pontiac,bonneville,2005,Boz, 06/23/2006,Farewell flagship...,4,"I bought this exceptional car as a statement of rebellion... and got the reaction I wanted. I had wanted one of these cars for about 8 or 9 years, and with most people starry-eyed for the cheaply built Honda or Toyota, this bad boy turns heads while going down the street. The Black Cherry Metallic paint sparkles in the sun, as well as in the evening, and exterior styling puts the car in motion, even at a standstill. Interior styling has no end to luxury and comfort, and features and options are limitless. GXP specific guages and Driver information center also set the car apart, and to finish it all off, Pontiac's signature dash backlit in glowing crimson."
pontiac,bonneville,2005,Adam B., 09/22/2019,Fantastic Car,5,"I bought a Bonneville in an honor of my grandmother. She loved Bonnevilles, and I decided to get the GXP. I know Northstars have head bolt problems, there’s a bullet proof fix, and I bought mine after the previous owner fixed it. I bought it with 83k, now it has 102k. 19k miles in a year! Any time I drive something different, I always end up missing the car. It’s been trouble free, comfortable, and quick. In some cases, I’ve gotten 25.4 mpg! But it’s hard to get that when you’re always on the gas. I have some modifications, including exhaust and the pops and crackles are addicting! I can’t wait until Northstar Performance gets the tune ready to remove the torque management and tune the trans and engine. For its price point, it’s faster than the, at the time, Ford Mustang, Audi TT, some BMWs, and it’s a full size FWD sedan! Can’t really ask for much more.

I absolutely love the styling, particularly on the exterior.  The pearl white shimmers in the sun and is gorgeous to look at.  The tan interior is great as well, although I have been a bit disappointed with some of the material qualities, particularly on the ceiling panel and dashboard.  I bought the car with 63,000 miles and have put on another 3,000 to date.  Other than a couple of major repairs up front (engine mount and instrument panel) this car has been practically problem free.  I love the power and handling and plan on keeping it for a very long time!   "

accept that it was white and showed 
every bug in Ga, Al, & Miss. BUT this 
GXP with V8 is a Blast. I can enjoy 
riding around and listening to these 
big 8 cylindars. With DOC and 4 
valves/Cyl. this car will kick ass. The 
super charged 6 on my 01 was quick, but 
this is 1.5 seconds faster. I am 
burning mid grade gas, and not getting 
the same mileage HWY or City, but the 
wasy it drives and sounds, it is worth 
it. do yourself a favor, test drive one."
pontiac,bonneville,2005,Mike Wandell, 12/19/2007,2005 Pontiac GXP,4,"I really love this car, I am in sales and drive it all over. It has all comfort I need and the the power when needed. I almost traded it in about 6 months ago on a Cadillac CTS. I took the Cadillac back and got my Pontiac back. The Cadillac was not as good as the Pontiac. It's just a lot of fun to drive, at night the dash looks an airplane cockpit."

The problems,oil and H2O leaks, rear drive problem, Onstar/radio, control for heat and air condition, wheel bearings eta. I have one year left on warranty- lucky me. "

Quality is poor, car is midnight blue and the primer shows through all over. GM won't respond so I'm going to BBB for buy back. 13 new GM's in last 20 years and this is how they treat return customers? Very unhappy with the fact they won't meet with me. Time to look at the Imports."

Stands out in a town of sameness (Lexus, BMW, Audi) and is a great ride.  At 6'2"", leg room is a minor issue, but seats are great and I am very comfortable.  The dashboard at night is stunning and the purr of the V-8 matches that.  Strongly recommended and fun and safe to drive. "

It is such a shame to see the Bonneville line discontinued after 48 great years - but at least it went out with a BANG!  So far, the only shortcomings are the lack of aftermarket performance items available for it and a little lower gas mileage than I expected. But we do drive it enthusiastically as it is just a blast and the exhaust note is incredible for factory-spec.  The GXP handles exceptionally well for such a large sedan and yet offers great ride quality.  Luckily, I found one of the last NEW GXP's with every available option in White-Gold Tricoat. "
pontiac,bonneville,2005,Mary Ann, 02/08/2009,I Love my Pontiac Bonneville,5,"I had a 1995 Bonneville and with it's mileage at 128,000 I knew it would last much longer but in 2005 they made the last one so I had to make a decision and decided to get the 2005.  I absolutely love it.  Can't say enough about it.  I can go a week on a tank - it gets me about 26 miles/gallon around town and to work.  It's comfortable to drive and even spend time in parked watching movies on a dvd player/doing computer work, etc.  Love it !  Bring it back so in ten years I can buy another!  GM must be slowing down selling cars because they are lasting longer!"
pontiac,bonneville,2005,D McCue, 08/14/2009,We love this car,5,"We purchased this car in Feb 2005; we have had abolutely no troubles with it. It is fun to drive, reminds me somewhat of the muscle car era I grew up in with a touch of class & luxury.  Ours is Black with gray/black leather interior.  We get the oil changed every 4-5 months as we don't drive a lot of miles, pleasure only, three vacation trips of 1,500-1,600 miles or so included in the 14,700 now on the car.  Actually it is my wife's car; her previous car was a 34,000 mile, T-Top 1996 Camaro; she didn't drive that one much either; about 6 vacation trips in that car; it had the 3000 V-6"
pontiac,bonneville,2005,A. J. Young, 01/11/2005,New car 2005,4,I like this car except for the price I paid for it.  It is smooth driving and very comfortable on long distance driving.  My 84 yr old brother-in-law finds it comfortable to ride in the back seat.
pontiac,bonneville,2005,Jfunsch, 01/12/2005,Awesome set on wheels,4,"I have owned my GXP for two mos. now. Absolutely love it...it's power, performance, ride, style and I could go on and on. It's comfortable sporty ride translate to a very responsive vehicle in all speed ranges. And I haven't even hit on the power to pass or accelerate...Boy, when I stand on the throttle the V-8 jumps to life and gets you were you were going, NOW!!! My step-daughter says, ""maybe we shouldn't have gotten him such a powerful car"" That says it all...I have almost 2500 miles on it. It is an incredibly fun luxury sport sedan. I love the Onstar and XM satellite radio..already have paid to extend the free trials on both for at least a year."
pontiac,bonneville,2005,cmsherm, 01/12/2005,Could have been better,2,"Style of the body makes the vehicle look welcoming due to the fact that this looks more like a sports car than the traditional family car.  The interior looks much more inviting than most of GM's bench seat in the front of their sedans.  However, looks can be deceiving.  The seats are very uncomfotable and traveling long distances make riding a horse seem more appealing.  The vehicle has good acceleration once you get out of first gear and the exhaust has a nice rumble when you hit the gas.  It is fun to drive on winding roads due to the wider wheel base.  You can find curves that suggest 30 mph, all the while you can be doing 60 mph mashing on the gas and never leave your lane."
pontiac,bonneville,2005,Gary, 03/25/2005,GXP,4,"All the bells and whistles of the Seville for less dollars. Fun to drive, but you give up a bit in the ride."

pontiac,bonneville,2005,Mike, 08/28/2005,Great Ride,4,"Only owned for about a month but so far very impressed.  Expert reviewers missed on this one, traded 300C which was a terrible car, nothing worked after 3 months, GXP has great drive train, more than enough power, very good handling for a front driver.  MPG so far is about 17/22 which should only improve with time"
pontiac,bonneville,2005,Mike Buchner, 10/23/2005,Good Vibes,4,"The Bonnie Gxp is a blast to drive.  With the sweet sound of it's pipes, I feel like it;s 1965 again. It has good power,could use more torque down low, but it's a dohc engine; and really starts to cook @ about 3500-4000 rpm.I love the styling. Looked at the Chrysler 300; but couldn't handle the cheese grader front end. And please; the Toyota Avalon is just plain ugly!  The Bonnie has a busy interior, but I love the red dash at night; XM radio is fantastic. Gas mileage is only ok but it is a big heavy car with a v8. But like the man said ""I feel good when I get in, and I feel good when I get out"" If your looking for a larger car that handles like a BMW;w/good power;nice ride,big trunk; GXP!"
pontiac,bonneville,2005,jocho, 11/18/2005,Excellent bargain.,5,"Great car.  Gas mileage @ 65mph > 31+, in town, 22.5.  Super ride, quiet, comfortable.  Sunroof is extra-large. Exception bargain, if you're looking for a superior, comfortable, car that gets great mileage.  Picked this one up used, 14,000 miles < $19.5K.  List for a new one is over $35K.   Thanks for earlier reviews, they helped make decision to buy. "
pontiac,bonneville,2005,John, 12/11/2005,Great Large Sedan,5,"I got this car on an impluse buy. Always wanted a Bonneville since I sold my 77. The Bonneville makes me rejoyce for whats American. It's roomy, powerful and stylish. I don't care that its FWD. I like the torquy 3800. There is also that performance axle ratio which gives it alot of off the line kick. I truly love driving this car. Took it on a 2500 miles and drove it in the mountains with the FE2 ride this car was alot of fun. My fuel economy was okay. My 3400 Impala will do better. But thats the cost you pay for performance. I am so happy with my Bonneville SLE, if I had money I would buy another one but it would be a GXP. GREAT TOURING SEDAN! Its a great sporty family sedan! "
pontiac,bonneville,2005,Mikki, 01/20/2006,Never Again,3,"Not a good car through rain and puddles.  It only has 27,000 on the odometer and the trans is shifting hard, clanking noise every now and again in front.  Brakes have been fixed once and checked three times.  They still squeal. Mechanic says it's the brakes they put on cars these days.  Also has blind spots.  Paid $22,000 and is simply not worth the money. I'm trading it in A.S.A.P"
pontiac,bonneville,2005,Paul J., 04/10/2006,Stylish and comfortable! Great punch!,5,"Driving has no longer become such a chore with the Bonneville. Just driving it for the pure joy of taking a ride is back. After owning a Bonneville in the past and my father owning 6 it seems apporiate to come back ""home"" agian. Proving the Bonneville is a great car and once you get one its very easy to get another one. The Bonneville with the 3800 Series II OHV V6 is plain peppy and is plenty of power for me and I was stepping down from a small block V8 powered GM car the six seemed almost as gusty. Part of that was due to the cars good gearing and performance axle ratio which was another reason I wanted an SLE. But I admit I love the GXP/SLE styling, it will age well! "
pontiac,bonneville,2005,GM-MAN, 04/08/2006,Wonderful touring sedan!,5,"What a wonderful car. I am so very pleased with my Bonneville SLE, and have driven on 3 over 500 mile trips in my SLE and just enjoy its great handling (FE2 ride and handling package) and great torque from the 3.8 Series II V6. I never forget I am in a Pontiac. I have put about 8000 miles on mine and really like its driving dynamics. It rides wonderful on the highway and does not comprise on curves. It cuts coners very stable with almost sports car like feedback and performance. Overall it is an impressive vehicle and classic American styling also get some thumbs up. I am very sad to see such a great large sedan be taken out of production! Pontiac bring the Bonneville back, I am waiting!"
pontiac,bonneville,2005,Jeff, 05/23/2006,Nice deal,4,"This is a large, safe, 4 door sedan built by the UAW in Michigan.  It is based on GM's G platform which also underpins the Buick Lucerne and Cadillac DTS, and it is lighter than both of these cars.  Most of the shortcomings of the Bonneville have been addressed in GM's newer models, but if you can live with them, the price is incredible."

with a lot of excitement thrown in. You 
find that any excuse to use this car is 
justifyable. Forget that its often less 
expensive to go by air. Who cares, its 
too much fun to drive especially in 
this GXP. Do not buy this car without

trip we got 25.3mpg the gas milage is 
better that the SUVs we had been 
looking at. Only problem so far has 
been fit and finsh. The driver side

GTP.  I loved the car and probably 
would have bought a new GTP if Pontiac 
hadn't revamped that style, in my 
opinion, for the worse--no more auto 
climate control, tighter interior 
space, etc.  The Bonneville GXP is 
definitely an excellent upgrade--it 
has all the features I had come to 
love like the HUD, performance and 
style.  The exterior styling is great, 
the V8 engine, 18-inch wheels and 
sporty suspension make this car fun 
and comfortable to drive.  The best 
color scheme is the graystone 
metallic, since it really compliments 
the interior trim colors.  The cockpit 
is great--day and night.  I've shopped 
around, and this car is best in its 
class and beyond."

no  major problems.  The lead me to the
GXP which in my mind is pure perfection.
 The ride is as smooth as any Lexus if
have owned.  The pick up the their when
needed.  As time goes forward, I am
looking for the same performance as the SSE."
pontiac,bonneville,2005,V8frk, 12/02/2004,Pure Fun,4,"I went from a 2001 Yukon to my 2004 
Greystone Metallic GXP.  The size was 
the toughest adjustment, but the power 
and handling made up for the loss of 
room.  It's nothing but muscle and fun 
to drive.  There's nothing better then 
merging into fast moving interstate 
traffic and listening to the growl of 
the Northstar at it's best!
I have had it in for warranty work 
four times since purchase in six 
months for silly minor things and one 
major A/C water leak which the dealer 
kept in the shop for a week!  Probably 
more of a dealer issue.  The brake

thinks it's acceptable."

Decided it was time for a new car, went with the Bonneville. I enjoyed the car for like the first week, then came the unreal amount of creaking in the dash, a weird thunk in the rear everytime I go over a bump, broken horn, and broken heater... this car is not what I expected...only have 15000 miles on it. The car had good power when needed and looks good but that's about it. I can't wait to get out of my Bonneville."
pontiac,bonneville,2005,B Udson, 05/23/2005,Great overall,4,Had a few electrical problems with the seats and fog lights and curb assist mirrors.  Worked out by dealer.

pontiac,bonneville,2005,gm4life, 07/02/2005,Good Car... But it its not for everyone!,5,"Lets see the Bonneville SLE is indeed one fine road car, if fact the other day I was rolling on the freeway and all of a sudden my SLE was up way past the 65mph I thought I was going, it was like 80! This car is smooth. As far as being some OHC motor from a Avalon or TL its not, but the Bonneville is good at being different and is never afraid to show its American roots. The interior room with the seats all the way back can be tight but if adjusted a little the back seat can be a pleasent place to pass time. The 3800 Series II OHV V6 give the SLE more than enough grunt to pass and even blow people off the line. (handy in rush how traffic)The interior is different but still sharp looking."
pontiac,bonneville,2005,Chak, 07/31/2005,"10 years of foreign, now GXP",4,"Both wife and I saw eye-to-eye after test drive of GXP, buy it.  Very quick to highway speed - sport suspension, braking all excellent. At 6'2'', pushing the envelope on room, bit more than OK.  Cockpit dashboard @ night is awesome.  Live in town with many Lexus, BMW, Audi, etc and this styling stands up to all of them, performance does too.  This is great choice and too bad they are discontinuing them."

pontiac,bonneville,2005,S. Dodson, 11/09/2007,Bring back the Pontiac Bonneville!,4,"Many heads turn when I drive by. The attention could be because of the sexy, throaty sound from the exhaust, or the look-alike lines of a NASCAR racing body.  I've been asked what kind of car it and in the same breath ask, ""is it a Pontiac"".  Then they say, ""nice looking car"". The lighted dashboard at night looks like the cockpit of a 747 - love it!  I can only wish that the Bonneville will return in great splendor; otherwise, I must go the way of Dodge -- Charger that is."
pontiac,bonneville,2005,gm4life, 12/08/2007,The Great American Touring Sedan,4,I have had nothing but excellent luck with my 2005 Bonneville SLE. It rides very smoothly but not overly floated like a Buick. The 3800 Series II V6 has excellent off the line pick up. Important for blowing off grannies in there Camry's. The trunk will hold loads of goodies and the steering is direct and gives good feedback. I have had one problem with my steering shaft other than that I have problem free time with this car. I intend to keep it in good shape and drive it forever. Anyone intrested in an excellent car and dosen't want a Camry or Impala this is a great family/touring car. My family and I love to take trips in this vehicle. It is the Great American Touring Sedan!

Performance add-ons I recommend without affecting reliability include a dual exhaust, Pro 5.0 shifter (WAY more precise), a Torsen limited-slip rear (expensive but very different experience than the open diff), and the ubiquitous aftermarket stereo system.

Interior cheap.  Dash cracked.

(molding).  Service engine light 
(bad air-pump).  Poor excuse for 
traction control.  Clutch slips 
when ""performing"" with too much weight

Speakers went POOOF!  Rotors warped

The Good
Hard hitting, throat tearing raw 
torque.  My 6sp hurst shifted trans-am 
hits hard when I put it to the floor

corners for the size of the car, 
suspension is stiff.  Handles nice at

The engine has great power, but the car

pontiac,firebird,2000,Cyrad2, 03/30/2004,I love it!,4,"I have owned the car for 3 years now. I
drive it everyday. I get comments on it
all the time, and the best part is
wiping the smiles of the pansies driving
mustangs.  Great bang-for-buck car. I
can't wait to trade up to a T/A!"
pontiac,firebird,2000,Kellie Morris, 04/23/2004,Love my Trans Am WS6,4,"I love my car, Im very upset that Gm 
doesnt make Trans Ams anymore, I would 
love to purchase in a few years a 
brand new Trans Am , I wouldnt want to 
trade this car for any other car 
unless it could be a brand new Trans 
Am, or possibly if they would make 
Camaro SS again also, but I would 
rather have my Trans Am! Gm made the 
biggest mistake when they stoped 
making the Trans Ams and Camaros, 
there is not another car out there 
that i would even think about haveing!"
pontiac,firebird,2000,attack, 04/26/2004,Formula WS6,4,Best car I've ever owned.
pontiac,firebird,2000,Carla V, 06/12/2004,I've died and gone to heaven!!!!,4,"I just got this car, but have been 
dreaming about it for years!! My 3rd 
firebird and my favorite!! Took me a 
long time to find exactly what I 
wanted...black, ram air, WS6, 6 speed, 
t-tops. I can't wait to race it!! 
Anyone who thinks their luxury car is 
better can kiss my butt!! I'm sad they 
don't make them anymore, so if you want 
one better get one while you still can 
before they are all worn out and used 
up!!"
pontiac,firebird,2000,JRMUNC, 09/27/2004,Great bird,4,"Car drives great handles like a 
dream.Great looks inside and out.Sound 
system is wonderful.T-tops slide in and 
out with ease."
pontiac,firebird,2000,Airez, 11/05/2004,Nothing can top this,4,"I got my car as a certifiedused vehicle from GeneralMotors.  I love the whole Firehawk appearence package.  Car is even better in stick.  This car does 14's with ease, if you put some slicks, even low thirteens."
pontiac,firebird,2000,Classy Bird, 03/16/2005,Fast - Not Furious,4,"I've owned this car since it was new.  Originally I had trouble with the power antenna and one of the headlights not popping up. Four trips to the dealer and the headlight finally was fixed - loose connection to motor. One other problem I had was the gas line regulator valve leaking gas into the engine when it was hot causing hard starting. I've not had any problems since these.  I've been real happy with the gas mileage. I get 18 mpg in town and 30 mpg on the highway. That's with a heavy foot.  Would have bought the TA except insurance would have been 4 times higher even though I haven't had a ticket for 15 years. Also, cost difference was $16 grand -  buy another car for that.   "
pontiac,firebird,2000,Elizabeth, 08/18/2005,Dependable Ride,4,I purchased this vehicle new.  The only problem that I have had with this car is the brakes (but I am always hard on brakes). 
pontiac,firebird,2000,Fredsbird, 01/29/2006,Best Bird yet,4,"I bought mine new and it has proven very reliable.  It has a solid feel, great looks (mine came with a beautiful metallic blue paint and chrome wheels).I have had 3 birds of various gens and none have been good off the line at a light, but on the highway they are incredible.  I first learned this when I found the passing gear going 80, it was like light speed kicked in. The gas mileage city/hwy is incredible. I had a weird noise in the engine but it went away, I believe it was due to my feeding it lower octane, stick with 93."
pontiac,firebird,2000,blk2000ws6, 03/21/2006,Trans Am,4,I own a 2000 Trans am WS-6 and it is a great car it handles very well has awesome power and I have never had a bit of trouble from it.
pontiac,firebird,2000,Hurley711, 05/27/2006,Trans Am review from a daily driver pers,3,"The car looks great and is fun to drive, but it also has some major downsides. Annoying pop up headlight motors break every few years. The cheap plastic interior rattles to no end, even SFC didn't eliminate all of the noise. Pros on the car are performance and styling. Head turner no matter where you go. Also can be easily modified to make more power if you need it."
pontiac,firebird,2000,JoshSSMaro00, 07/15/2006,Firebirds and Camaro Live FOREVER!,4,"The Firebirds looks are Killer!  I own a 2000 Camaro SS and the looks are a bit different, but same everything!  The car is a BLAST to drive!  It is now cheaper for younger buyers, the aftermarket is unbelieveable..  There are millions of Brands and things you can do for cheap also! (GM) My dad has a Z06 and i will say the vette is bitchen but i love my camaro looks..  But i want his engine and tranny!"
pontiac,firebird,2000,cregets, 03/21/2003,Awesome Car!!!,4,"Ive got a 2000 WS6 Trans Am.  Nothing 
but fun in this car.  The LS1 responds 
well to mods and it is a killer fast 
car to begin with.  Gas is good for a 
sports car, and it will get looks from 
everyone who hears it coming!!  I dont 
think you could get a better bang for 
the buck."
pontiac,firebird,2000,Ryan, 11/13/2006,WS6 Ram Air,4,"This was the best Trans Am built to date. Too bad it only lasted two more years. It rides great fro a sports car, is comfortable on long trips, and performs close to the level of the more expensive Corvettes of the time. I bought this car used and the only repair I had to do was replacing a headlight motor. Amazing cars!"
pontiac,firebird,2000,stringer, 03/07/2007,Killer 2000 T/A WS6,5,"Third trans am I've owned, and the fastest. Love the racey exterior, and interior. Handles great around corners, passes with ease. A definite looker. A very fun car to drive. "
pontiac,firebird,2000,Wildstar43, 03/05/2007,Mean LS1,4,I have had two cars previous to the Trans Am. Both were Camaros and I have been pleased with the over all reliability and performance of the car. Not to mention getting the parts to modify the f-bodies are easy to find.
pontiac,firebird,2000,cness05, 07/04/2007,53 and my new muscle car,4,"This car is hot. Red 5.7 V8,6 speed trans with out the skip shift. It has great looks.drives like a dream,and more get up and go than my 72 Camaro had. But this car's ride is much better ,and will set you back in your seat very quickly. As far as fuel mileage it does not matter, what a thrill to drive. To sum this car up GM made a mistake dropping the Firebird and Camaro lines. I love this car and will keep it a long time. This car is priceless. "

made. It has the speed that I want 
when I need to get up and go"
pontiac,firebird,2000,Rick, 04/10/2008,This Black bird is BAD,5,"I purchased this car with 45 miles on the odometer and have had more fun than should be allowed.Be sides a dead battery and headlight motor this car has been a gem to own. It now has 91,600 miles on the it and it still barks the tires in the first three gears.I guess I should mention that it has the 6 speed tranny with the Hurst shifter.I've added a k&n air filter and flowmaster exhaust a month after purchase"
pontiac,firebird,2000,Chris K, 07/13/2018,WS6,5,"I've had this car for over 15 years. Just had to have the transmission rebuilt a year ago. It's still running great and strong.

"
pontiac,firebird,2001,crazygrrrl, 08/01/2010,Luv my weekend toy,4,"At 45,000 miles, this is the only car I've ever bought new that I've never regretted buying. I would buy one again in a heartbeat if GM sells them again. The v6 may be an old design but it is strong and reliable, and my car has never left me stranded. I get compliments all the time. I love the fact that you can see the engine and all hoses, belts, etc. newer cars have that awful plastic cover that hides everything. This car is easy to work on, aftermarket parts are readily available even after GM killed Pontiac. This is definitely an enthusiast's car. It's fun to drive and comfortable too! I love this car.  I'm going to keep it until I get too old to drive."
pontiac,firebird,2001,01TransAm, 09/21/2010,Best Car Ever,5,"A more beautiful (yet mean looking), fun to drive, and comfortable car has never been made. I have the WS6, automatic, and it is still practically like new. The only thing it really needed that is not stock is subframe connectors to get rid of the body roll. I completely disagree with the Edmunds review about the interior. The interior plastic is not cheap. It it much better looking than any new car interior, plus the lumbar support leather seats are top notch. The proportions are perfect - low profile, long hood, enough of a back seat to put stuff in. Millage is 17 city, over 25 if all highway, which is not bad, but who really cares anyway. "
pontiac,firebird,2001,t/a man, 12/12/2003,trans am ws6 review,5,"Though minor problems have been 
experienced, such as mass airflow 
sensor,this car is a joy to own, and 
even more fun to drive.  Reliability 
has never been an issue,nor has ride 
quality, as some might think.  The ws6 
ram air package is also worth it's 
weight in gold.  In summary, I would 
most definately recommend this car to 
anyone in the market, and I plan to 
still have this car for many, many 
years to come.  "
pontiac,firebird,2001,ksford1, 02/03/2014,LOVE THIS CAR!!!!,4,"14 yrs. ago I was in a Pontiac dealership having a
repair on my 1990 Sunbird, it was already at 150K mile. So as I was wondering around the showroom and spied a Red T-Top 75th Anniversary Edition Firebird!
Can you say IMPULSE BUY?! Well I've never been disappointed with her.
She sits in my driveway right now, looking just as good as she did the day I drove her home, and a few offers to buy her. Sure, there could be more room in the back seat, have replaced EGR Valve, a headlight issue I solved, and recently a new ignition cylinder, but she's got almost 140k miles and I've Loved every one of them! I plan on giving her to my great-nephew in 3 years for his High School Graduation, or not... "
pontiac,firebird,2001,01 firebird, 10/18/2010,Fun car not reliable daily driver,4,This car is fun to drive with like a sports car but with the v6 you don't have to worry about gas. The only problem with this car that I have had so far are strange electrical issues (ex. The headlights flip up and down when using the power locks with the remote?) also has electrical problems after being stored. Still a great convertible for Florida weather 
pontiac,firebird,2001,Smoky Mountain T/A, 02/25/2006,Proud American T/A,5,"I previously owned a 1996 Formula but wanted a convertible. Since I loved the Formula, I bought a Trans Am with only 3500 miles on it from a collector. This T/A is even better than the Formula with incredible acceleration and really too much power. The cloth top is easy to maintain and open/close. The ride is fine although I heard the WS6 handling package makes for a stiffer ride. There really is no need for the WS6 unless you are racing the car. The automatic transmission takes you right to the red line so don't bother with the 6-speed unless that is what you prefer. Why anyone would buy a foreign sports car is beyond me. It is a shame the American mindset has turned to foreign ownership."
pontiac,firebird,2001,sic2001, 12/28/2008,One sick car,4,"I have had my car for 5 yrs now and it is awesome! I have put all kinds of aftermarket bolt ons on and dyno'd at 379 rwhp. It's fast and has never left me stranded! I've replaced the fuel pump myself within 2 hrs in the driveway and 150 for parts and find most repairs can be done easily and the info is excellent online. Put good shocks/struts on it, lower it, and youll keep up with the current M3 on twisties it handles so well. I have the navy blue metallic w/tan interior and people act like it's a Ferrari no kidding. 7 yrs old and looks like it could have been released this year. Catalytic converters are covered under warranty for 10 yrs or 100,000 miles."
pontiac,firebird,2001,Robison, 10/18/2002,Most Misunderstood Automobile,4,"My 2001 Firebird is my 3rd Firebird. 
Admitedly a niche automobile, as a 52 
year old Engineer, I find the 4th 
generation to be solid, realiable, and 
a blast to drive. The 200Hp V6 is 
plenty strong and though not a Transam, 
I find the average person doesn't know 
the difference. GM failed to properly 
market fun features like T-tops and how 
well the 4th gen are sealed against 
water leaks."
pontiac,firebird,2001,JACKf, 11/13/2002,Trans Am fever,4,"I have loved the firebird since the 
inception in the 1960's.  I have a 99' 
firebird and 01' trans am.  I love them 
both and cannot find a car with the 
same high performance, race car ready, 
drive.  I cannot think of anything bad 
to say of the firebird."
pontiac,firebird,2001,Vinterskugge, 02/20/2006,Love It,4,"This review is of the WS6 Trans Am.   This is the most beautiful car ever and is a lot of fun to drive. It's a shame they are not made anymore, although if they were, they would probably be ruined with a hideous new design. This is the shape that cars should be: low, wide, 2-doors, long hood. Only drawback is lack of trunk space, but the backseat is perfect: you cannot ask for a better design as far as being able to reach into the back seat from either the outside or the front seat. No problems in light snow with all season tires. Car is still like new. True muscle car driving excitement, plus unrivaled aesthetic beauty"
pontiac,firebird,2001,Chip, 05/10/2006,2001 TA WS6 Convertible,4,I have had this car for a few years now. Great car! Pontiac had to be crazy for stopping production. I have a 74 SD and this 2001. Love them both. Added a flowmaster for more growl and this car has the neighbors kids giving me the thumbs up every time it hits the streets. 
pontiac,firebird,2001,Cindy, 06/28/2007,Still loving it after 6 years!,4,"My husband and I drove into the dealership ""just to look"". An hour later we had a black Trans AM WS6. We had looked at BMW's but like my husband said, I didn't giggle when I drove it. That was in May of 2001. I am still loving every minute I drive it! It still gets looks and comments. The stereo is out of this world. One of best purchases we have ever made in our lives."

pontiac,firebird,2001,onoshedien01, 06/24/2008,Gas is Holding me Back,4,Overall performance when I first purchased car was excellent.  No repairs needed.  Maintenance was kept up from previous owner.  Great condition inside/out.  Bought at 65k. Take curves like a whip.  Engine was eager to drive like a bat out of hell. Now at 121k still runs good but maintenance is needed. 
pontiac,firebird,2001,^^Re-bound, 08/30/2008,*purrs*,4,"I've had an '88 Dodge Aries, '95 Geo Metro & an '02 Ford Explorer Sport Trac.  I said I'd NEVER drive another car after being in my truck but with gas at $4 & getting 17 mpg while driving a 60 mile daily commute. I had to re-evaluate.  I was shown 3 crap cars when I went in for a trade- in (1 was TOTALLY crapped out & wouldn't even crank!) & then shown this '01 Firebird.  I drove it.  That's all there was to it.  I giggled the whole time!  Kit had 75K miles on her & hadn't been taken care of very well but she purrs like a dream & the LOOKS she gets is just mesmerizing!!  *giggles*  Truck?  What truck?!  :D"
pontiac,firebird,2001,KELI JONES, 02/26/2006,I love my birdie,5,This is the second firebird i have owned the first was a 1996 had alot of problems with that one but the design and handling made me come back to the firebird. I have also owned 2 cameros they do not hold a candle no comparison. I love to just drive with the t-tops off. This car is great. And this car is 5 years old but looks brand new. Only 41000 miles. Holds up great. One day maybe they will build a car that will compare for the money. Gm really screwed up by stopping production. What a shame. They are bringing back an old gto. But stop making the best car they had. I question common sense there its a shame. And by the way i drive a bird because that is what i like not because thats all i can  
pontiac,firebird,2001,TTraveler23, 03/02/2004,V6 Grown Up,4,"When I was just thinking about trading 
in my 92 Firebird V-6 3.8, I took a 
test drive in this car.  I still liked 
my 92, but it had over 200,000 miles on 
it! I found the performance to be 
outstanding, and the car is very 
comfortable.  The extra features such 
as the Traction Control system and the 
6 speed transmission only add to the 
performance.  The gas mileage is 
excellent for a V8, it is close to that 
of my former V6. I highly recommend 
this model."
pontiac,firebird,2001,Sticher, 03/12/2003,Bird Lover,4,"Fun car to drive.  Always get a lot of 
compliments on style and color.  I have 
not a problem with this car and it gets 
great gas milage.  Averages 22mpg in 
everyday use and 27 mpg on trips.  Very 
little wind in the cabin with the top 
down and can drive in 80 degrees plus 
with the air on and down to 50 with 
heat.  Best car I have ever owned"

We recommend this vehicle to anyone who wants a sports car and dosent worry about the price of gas
"
pontiac,firebird,2001,BOB BACCHI, 02/16/2016,The BatMobile,4,"I was very fortunate to find this very low mileage car that is 15 years old. It was garage stored by previous owner for a number of years. The PO had the car completely detailed, oil changed, replaced filters, 4 new quality tires. Looks and drives like a new car. The handling is excellent. The ride is very smooth, no rattles or road noise.  Good acceleration for the 3.8  V-6. The driver and passenger seats are very comfortable and bolstered. Access and egress are a bit tight, as the car sits low. The rear seats are very close to the fronts and only small people or children will fit with comfort. Very adequate trunk space for a hatchback.
The BatMobile rocks!
I bought the car in Hawaii where I live part time and after a year there, had it shipped to my home in La Jolla, CA so it would be garaged instead of under a cover.
The original beautiful green-to-blue color paint gets a lot of compliments. The color changes when the sun shines on it.
I've been checking the mileage and with normal driving we get about 26 MPG overall. Love the BatMobile!

I like the 31 hwy mpg cause I'm daily on the Highway anyway. I have been offered way above what it's worth and always have people staring because the car is a head turner.

it took me one months time to regret 
my not going in for the V-8 engine. 
Not that the V6 was bad but it 
definitely lacked the vroom of the v8. 
Went on 1000 mile trips (one way) and 
this car was an absolute delight to 
drive. Among the most comfortable for 
long rides definitely. The seating is 
especially good for such rides. 
Had some problems with its brake 
rotors which had to be replaced at 10K 
miles and seemed like again around 18K 
miles. Was covered by warranty though. 
But would recommend it to someone 
looking for the best looking coupe 
there is."

it.  I added a flowmaster exhaust, K&N

rims to Coddington Shyster 17"" rims and 
put BF Goodrich KDSW tires on it.  I 
run a mix of 2 gal racing 100 fuel 
mixed with the rest 91 octane.  These 
four improvements have really improved 
the already excellent performance.  
Now, I have little tire spinning (even 
with the tires a little wet), no 
hesitation or knocking (because of the 
fuel mix), and with the improved air 
flow the car is really explosive now.

pontiac,firebird,2001,Great Play, 10/26/2003,Unbridled power and head turner.,4,"Added a Corsa exhaust, K&N filter, and 
skip-shift eliminator.  Incredibly 
fast and powerful.  Traction control 
makes it usable in winter weather as 
well.  Appearance, performance, and 
sound stuns other drivers.  A pure 
pleasure to own."
pontiac,firebird,2001,firechkn, 11/15/2003,01 Formula Firebird,4,"I love my car. I never have to worry 
about being stuck behind a slow driver. 
Push the gas and go. This car gets geat 
mileage for a V8, I average 380 per 
tank. The only downfalls are,is it's 
too low for my mom to get in and out of 
easily and there are blindspots from 
the A posts. I would rather line this 
car in plastic when I have kids than 
get rid of it. Best car I've ever owned."

row. Yes, that's right. I started with 
a 1992, 1997 and now a 2001. All gave 
good performance, were fun to drive, 
held their value and easy on the 
wallet. I have only owned the 2001 4 
months. The drive shaft and fuel pump 
failed on the 97. I was costly to 
repair, but managable, largly because 
of the dealership.."

pontiac,firebird,2001,William, 12/29/2005,It doesnt get any more fun,4,"I've owned a V6 camaro, a Z28, and now this Trans Am, and it is by far MUCH faster and has a lot more power than the Z28. It's got plenty of power, yet can be refined enough for city driving. Not to mention this is just a beautiful car. The leather in the car is top notch, my only complaints are with the traction control system. It does work, but it's not very effective performance-wise. It decelerates the engine for too long of a time and does not enhance performance, unlike the 350Z that I sell whose traction control system is beyond par. Otherwise, this car has more power than any other car you can buy for this amount of money. Period. And the great looks, dependability, 4.5 out of 5 star"

Add a flowmaster and a cold air

The power's good and it's fun to drive, 
but it sucks on gas.  The handling is 
really good, but it's better with 17in 
wheels and 45 series Z-rated tires.  
Good gripe and side-slipe is 
controllable.  The only thing I hate 
about this car is the ""Skip-shift"" 
feature.  I bought a six-speed for 
controllablity.  Skip-shift is a buzz 
kill."
pontiac,firebird,2001,Pete, 12/12/2004,Great ride,4,The firebird is fun to drive and the 3.8 liter V-6 provides ample acceleration.

winner in my Trans Am. Its a true 
American Muscle Car. But at the same 
time, thats the problem too. Its a true

and is UNCOMFORTABLE to drive. I cant 
keep gas in this thing! In a way i 
guess you could say its almost a burden 
to drive.  But when it all comes down 
to it, it wasnt built for these

pontiac,firebird,2002,Ras, 04/28/2016,The GM Enthusiast's Ticket to Sub-13's in 1/4 Mile,5,"First off this car in stock form is an absolute treat and if you are looking for a fun daily driver in good to mildly bad conditions this car will deliver in spades.  Just don't expect to roll it out during a blizzard or something without the proper tires, it's performance in the snow is nothing to write home about. However, on a nice dry day this car will put a smile on your face without dropping a single cent on modifications. The interior is classic GM which is to say, plastic and somewhat cheap but it is very friendly to the driver and will give you a powerful feeling the moment you get behind the wheel. The aggressive styling of the exterior, particularly with the WS6 package(which included a hood and some other goodies), makes this car stand out from all others as a real eye catcher. Now if you find yourself bitten by the performance bug, the 5.7 liter LS1 V8 takes to bolt-on modifications like a fish takes to water, it is possible to modify this car without internally changing this engine to over 350 whp on a good tune(mods would include headers, underdrive pulley etc). The (1993-)2002 Trans AM WS6 is a treat to drive and great to own, a fantastic car that unfortunately was met with lukewarm reception due to the times and I would recommend it to anybody looking to not only join a community of enthusiasts but also drive what is quickly becoming the greatest performance dollar to horsepower ratio you will find on any platform from any auto-maker!

Highly recommended!"
pontiac,firebird,2002,nwittig54, 06/17/2013,"Good, Cheap, Fun.",4,"This was the second car I ever bought and have owned it for about two years now. I got it with about 73k on it and am now about 83k. It's been a reliable car but the previous owner did not take care of it at all. The build quality of the interior is a little cheap but the seats are super comfortable and the car hugs the road perfectly. The only major issue I've had, like with all GM V6's, was the intake manifold gasket. Upon replacing the car drove like it was brand new. I will never sell this car and it is about to become my weekend car. I get compliments from people all the time. Also, beat some punk in a Supra to give you some perspective... my car is bone stock."

Even though it's just a V6, this thing still has a lot of power (205HP) stock and handles amazingly on the road at any speed. Hugs the road like no one's business. Sounds great. Super comfortable and very durable interior. Great looking exterior!
Only thing I've had to do to it was replace the fuel pump at 92k, other than that it's been great!

I paid $4,200 for this car, but after driving it, I would GLADLY pay double that for another one!

All I can say is I found the car that no matter what else I own, will always be in my driveway!"

I can't believe Pontiac screwed up the marketing so bad.  This is an awesome ride.  It is blistering fast and can hold four people.  It is the closest thing to flying a jet fighter and can still get 26 MPG.  I can't praise its handling enough.  Mine ran a 13.10 and it is totally stock and I had never raced before.  Pontaic under rated the horse power for sure!
pontiac,firebird,2002,WYO_VR4, 11/04/2005,I love my WS6 vert!,4,"I was very happy got a great deal on my car. It's a true performance bargain and so much fun to drive. Turns heads wherever I go and gets over 30mpg in 6th gear on the highway - a nice feature these days! Cruising around with the top down this summer was awesome. It's the best car I've ever bought. I much prefer the instant torque of the LS1 to any turbocharged import. The car is easy to work on and upgrade, if desired. I'm happy with mine as it is but I did upgrade the stereo. The one in the vert is rather puny compared to the coupe's. Then again, who needs a stereo when the car sounds this good. American muscle at its finest. Highly recommended but don't forget that radar detector!"

stock rear wheel numbers. No wonder 
these cars propel you through the 
quarter in mid to low 13's with ease 
all the while let you park yourself in 
a nice power leather seat with the a/c 
on, cd's jammin' ttops off etc etc etc.

twisties. BTW, I'mn ot a small guy by 
any means, 6'2'', 285 and fit in her 
fine.

weekend I folded down the rear seat 
and hauled home several 4X8 sheets of

kept it under 80 for the trip home :)"
pontiac,firebird,2002,Tyler, 01/06/2016,r8 gr8 m8 8/8,5,"Im 17 years old, but this is my 3rd car, and is by far the best. It is extremely comfortable to drive, the seats are amazing. The sound system is pristine for being a 14 year old system. I love driving it. Before I got this car, I used to drive my dads car, a 2014 Cruze, every chance I got. I haven't driven his car since I got this car. We replaced the throttle body when we got the car, and haven't had any major issues since then. Its not very hard to work on if you like to work on your cars yourself. All in all, its an amazing car. The only complaint I have is the cupholder. There's only 1 up front, and its not deep enough. Other than that, 10/10. Its great.

I've lusted after the WS6 for a long time.  About a month and a half ago I was telling my wife about a 02 WS6 Collectors Addition with 27k miles on it in Dallas.  She told me to go get it.  I flew in and bought it and drove it 1,200 miles home.  I really like my firebird.  I'm in love with the WS6!!  It gets very good mileage for the size of the engine.  It can get over 110 mph very very quickly.  And the ride is better than I could have imagined.  I thought it would be like my normal car.  It isn't.. Its the same but different.  I can't describe it.  It had blown speakers when I bought it.  I put an upgraded system in it regardless of it being a collectors add..  I doubt I'll ever sell it.. And now it has the nice mp3 connections and everything you'd expect with an upgraded system with an added base speaker.  I can't say enough about this car..  I was going to use it as a daily driver but after I 1st drove it I realized I had to keep my old car as the daily driver and allow this one to be the fun car!  Its beautiful!

It's now over 450 horsepower and kills just about everything off the line. The interior is a little cheap and needs some work but the engine totally makes up for it. I have never had a serious problem with the car, and she loves the cold weather and the heat and air work better in this then in my friends BMW.

I'm so glad I gave in.I bought my Fire Engine Red Firebird WS6 pkg used w/39k miles on it and in mint condition. I couldn't believe how perfect this car was. I am a true muscle car lover and this car is awesome. Sadly I was rearended and the frame was bent so the insurance co. totaled it out. It is a very safe car but body repairs are expensive. I never got to take it to the track but next time I will! My hubby promised me another one so I am on the look out for another one, red w/ blk lthr #2."

It's one of the sharpest cars on the road and the SLP exhaust system sounds great. The car sounds so good that I really don't listen to the radio much. I enjoy the sound of the engine.

The only thing that could possibly be 
better than this is a 'Vette Z06. It's 
completely reliable, unless you think 
you don't have to change the oil or 
air up the tires. The only problem 
with this car is that stupid press 
people (i.e. Edmunds.com, Motortrend) 
seem to have forgotten that a car 
should have the goods, and not the 
hype. If you're ready for the real 
deal, a sports car that can blow the 
doors of any Japanese import or Ford 
product, then step right up. Posers 
may take Mustangs and Celicas."

then the Trans Am (with Ram Air). The 
Mustang just didn't compare to the 
Trans Am. The Trans Am is just a 
pleasure to drive. I use the car as my

pontiac,firebird,2002,ajax, 09/03/2002,Could be great with some improvements,4,"The pontiac 2002 Firebird TransAM coupe 
has the looks that make you just want 
to stare at it when you see one. I 
suspect the Ram Air would put most 
sports car lovers over the top with 
envy. There are some negatives that 
come with the acolades. Three issues in 
particular are the way the car idles 
when standing still with the car in 
drive and foot on the break.( shaky ). 
The second problem is the Rotors warp 
frequently. Suspect bad manufactured 
pads cause extream heat friction that 
cause the warpage. The third item is 
the Head lights make alot of noise when 
closing them. ( Bang! ) Otherwise a 
great car looking car with excellent 
speed when you need it most."

cars costing twice as much, along with 
it's menacing head-turning looks, how 
can you go wrong? Anyone who has the 
means and the opportunity to own this 
car would be doing themselves a huge 
favor to check it out. Once you drive 
it you'll understand. Why anyone would 
choose the uglier, boxy, slower Mustang 
is beyond me. GM's decision to end the 
Firebird/Camaro is a true shame. 
Pontiac is left with nothing but boring

This is my 4th f-body, previously owned 1988 Camaro 5SPD.[305v8], 1994 Z28-6SPD., 1995 Trans Am-6SPD., 1996 Z28-6SPD. and will say this is by far the best in looks, pure speed, handling-(275-40ZR17 wheels and tires sure help) and getting a thumbs up from other motorists. I was looking for a 6speed but got a great deal on an auto[4L60E] in arctic white that I couldn't pass up. Interior has  fighter jet cockpit sensation, 500 watt monsoon audio.

that sold us.  Looks were the biggest 
thing, the fact that it was fast, had

The 2002 is even better though.  In a world full of me-too cars like the Mustang and cars that all look like they came from the same mold, the Trans Am stood out as being different, bold, and aggressive, more than even it's own sibbling the Camaro.  Every magazine always pits Mustang vs. Camaro when it talks about muscle cars but that's just PR work.  It was the Trans Am that made muscle cars. think screaming chicken, smokey & the Bandit, or Knight Rider.  GM did nothing to help the Fbody compete, they died not from abandonment by consumbers but by neglect from their parent, thanks GM"

out the WS6 Trans AM!  My car has the 
6-speed tranny and the evil 5.7L LS1 
V8. GM rates the horsepower at 325 and 
torque at 350lbs.  I have seen dynos 
that show 310-320+ horsepower to the 
rear wheels.  This means the car is 
actually producing 360-375 HP at the 
flywheel.  The car has very 
comfortable seating with lots of front 
leg room but not so much in the rear.  
My car also gets on average 20 mpg in 
the city.  Not bad for a hot rod.  One

Great looks, decent interior (still has GM's plastic-itis), and most importantly,unsurpassed performance. I drove several mustangs, from the V6 putt-putt-mobile to the GT's to the Bullit, all claiming 'headsnapping acceleration and power'.  Although impressive, 'headsnapping' is a joke; and the TA's 0-60 time proves it.  I have yet to find a high volume production mustang that can catch the TA, more or less keep up with it.  It's a shame GM marketing has let this car reach this point.  Truly the end of the affordable sportscar/muscle car era.  Glad I got mine before they're gone."

When we got the car it had a spun bearing (which is very common for the 3800 series 2 due to the low oil pressure it runs) so me and my dad rebuilt the engine. It drove amazing both before and after our modifications. We put a Comp Cams cam shaft in it, boosted the compression ratio to 10.3 to 1, shaved the heads down, and got a sweet tune from Intense Racing. From the interior of this car to the exterior, it is a very sweet ride. The curves of the car make it stand out among all these newer cars. There's nobody out there making a sports car any where near as nice as this one. I wish they would bring it back!!!

cars.  Think of it, a Mustang shaped 
car with a more upright seating

The interior doesn't live up to the exterior, however. Not horrible, but you'd expect more from a car that was top of the fleet for Pontiac when it was out.  When Pontiac makes this car again (and they will, only a matter of time) they should improve this, along with reducing cabin noise.

GREAT car for summer cruising with the 
T-tops out. My car is Pewter Metallic

this car everyone and make sure to get 
one before there all gone!!"

I traded in my GTP which was fun, but this WS6 is beyond belief for great driving - even in city traffic.  Had to have the TransAm to save as a collector's item.  Sorry that this is the end of the Firebird line."
pontiac,firebird,2002,T/A lover since '74, 03/19/2002,"Power, Performance, Fun and Romance",4,"The Pontiac Firebird is fun to drive, with a muscular V-6, 16 inch wheels, and four disc anti-lock brakes.  This car is meant for serious drivers only.
The handling is superb, responsiveness is excellent, and the cornering is great.  The car is sexy and I get compliments all the time.  I opted for the optional six year/sixty-thousand mile warranty, I plan on keeping this car till death.  If you're thinking about it, go for it.  This car is well worth the money and insurance."

I already have scratches on the interior door panels near the feet."
pontiac,firebird,2002,Cancerman, 03/19/2002,How dumb can GM get!,4,"I purchased my black 3.8l 5M Camaro some months ago and still love it. Bargain performance. Great fun to shift. 205 horsepower blows away the pitiful little more expensive imports.Love the look--sleek and sexy. Seating is adequate, although sometimes difficult to see the gauges unless the wheel is positioned correctly. It's a shame that GM can't see the value in this excellent product."
pontiac,firebird,2002,William1, 03/25/2002,Awesome Rod,4,"This is the last year this beast will ever be made. Speed over to a dealership and get one. Don't waste your hard earned money on a Mustang. I am currently leasing a 2001 Convertible. Don't drive it anymore after purchasing the Trans. This is my second and believe me, the V8 makes all the difference."
pontiac,firebird,2002,John Richmond, 09/27/2020,Pontiac Firebird y-87,5,"V-8 or v-6  that’s the only decision you need to make.   Because they’re two different cars. V-8  cars are Hi Performance  Machines period.   V-6 cars like mine are not.  Yes v-6 cars have surprising power, Yeah they corner great, Yeah they’re great highway cars. All on 87 octane. The V-8 cars need Premium gas. Have High insurance rates.  There’s no way to have that power and not use it.  Because the car is very fast.  So you got to watch out for the cops.  Both cars are terrible in the winter.   I park mine for the winter months.  The  v-6 six cars look good, And have decent  performance, mines got a great Monsoon 8 speaker stereo.  Holds the road like it’s on a rail  Great seats, And 30 miles a gallon on the highway.  And insurance loves to be v-6  they’re both great cars I’ve had both.     If killer performance is your thing then definitely get the V-8.  If it looking good is your thing than the V-6 is your car.   Remember it goes from 0 to 60 in 7.2 seconds. The Y-87 option on the V-6 cars  gave you a 3.42  10 bolt posi,  trans Am steering box,  dual exhaust, and  Four wheel disc brakes  This option made the Firebird a great car.   Thanks   for listening cheers from Ann Arbor.

It met my expectations 100%.  I'm 6'6"" tall and cannot believe how comfortable the seats are.  I love this car and it's exactly as I expected.  For the people who rate the performance anything less than a 10, go buy a Corvette.  I had a Honda and am soooo happy I sold it to buy the G3.  No complaints, very happy!!!"

It now has a little over 52K and its has never been at the dealer except for oil changes and two alignments! It's due for a tune up this month... It still runs great!

I have not had any mechanical problems, however I have 2 camshaft position sensors go bad. This causes the car to sputter and lose power and causes a lot of jerking which is bad for the transmission. The ride is a little rough, about what you would expect in a sub-compact. Power is a joke, 12 seconds to 60 MPH, and fuel economy could be better, and other cars in it's class (from the same year model) get better gas mileage and still have better performance. On-Star never worked from the start and the dealership gave me the run around about fixing it, so it never was, not that I would subscribe to a nonsense service anyway."

Car have 80000 miles and already need it a new tranny and radiator, which GM didn't want it to fix, even thoug it was under warranty, 100,000 miles power train.($5500.00 repair) at this point, the A/C is acting up, even thoug we took it to the dealer before the end of warranty, but they didn't want to fix it.

Yes, they look nicer than the Honda Fit and Yaris, and mine even came with power windows, moon roof, on-Star, sports interior and stylish wheels, BUT it is all show and no substance. The car is not even 3 years old and has had the PCM computer changed (the computer that controls EVERYTHING on the car - and would cost around $1000 if not covered by warranty, the ignition coil changed twice (each costing around $300 if not covered by warranty), and the oxygen sensors changed (each costing around $300 if not covered by warranty).

I, too would like to have tinted windows. I'm down south, and it makes a difference. Got it fully loaded for $10,200!!   By the way, I was going to get a g5, but muuuch less head room!

The car doesn't save me gas because I drive more and fill up at lease 2 to 3 times a week.  The chip will go out without warning while on the highway.  This last time I was almost hit by a truck.

I had no idea Daewoo could make such a great set of wheels at such a low price tag too.  I can't say what reliability is since we only had it for about a month now if that.  We got this car under the cash for clunkers program as a ""bridge"" vehicle until the plug in hybrids come out.  Looks like someone else reviewing this vehicle is doing the same thing as well."
pontiac,g3,2009,doug casey, 09/21/2009,Low cost transportation,4,"I bought this car with the cash for clunkers program, so the price was $7600 and my now crushed Cherokee. The only option I bought was the AC. The first tank of gas I got 32 combined MPG, mostly highway. I am a conservative driver. All I wanted was good cheap transportation, and I am VERY happy with this purchase. If you want a Cadillac, buy a Cadillac. This car rides and handle fine, good headroom, and is kind of cute. The engine RPM seems high on the highway, but it rides good and is not very noisy. If it is reliable for years, I would buy another."

Roomier than it looks. "
pontiac,g3,2009,djehall, 12/25/2009,Cheap fun,4,"Bought this three weeks ago.  I traded in a Nissan Frontier  I wanted better gas mileage and no longer needed a pickup.  My local Pontiac dealer had one left, with every toy I wanted (sunroof, cruise), and toys I didn't know I wanted until I had them (OnStar, XM, lumbar support).  I liked the interior, especially the seats.  Sad that Pontiac is going the way of the DeSoto, but decided to take up GM's offer on remaining Pontiacs.  This is fun to drive, gets good gas mileage, and I'm not worried about finding replacement parts, since it's a rebadged Aveo.  Wife likes it as well, and offered to give me her Jeep Patriot for it (I turned her down).  All in all, a great and easy choice for me. "

I have over 20,000 miles on it and it runs like a clock. I have not noticed any of the issues noted in other posts but I was dissappointed in the mileage I got out of the OE tires. I have already replaced them and the alignment showed everything was within spec. It's a bit of a rough ride but to be expected in this small of a car. Based on what I paid for this car brand new with full warranty I'm thrilled with it. "

pontiac,g3,2009,HUMMER OWNER, 07/22/2009,Is this a joke?,1,"So i have a new 09 Hummer and due to the deteriorating economy the dealership has the G3 as their loaner fleet.  Not a big deal since I anly (cross my fingers) have to drive this thing for a few days...  Honestly GM rebadging a DAEWOO is about as lame as watching TV without TiVo...  how can you people say that you like this gocart with a straight face??? its slower than molasses in winter, about as much sind noise as a motorcycle doin 90 the AC is horrible the seats belong in a john boat, this thing reminds me of cheap toys made in china - when you buy them new do they come in a box with crappy assembly instructions and plastic tools??"
pontiac,g3,2009,John, 08/19/2009,Not a happy camper with the G3 mileage,3,I am not satisfied with the gas mileage that I am getting on my new g3. I am only getting 24 in the city and 29 on the highway. The rating on the car when I bought it stated 29 city and 34 highway and in small print at the bottom it stated up to 40 mile per gal.  Well I am not coming close  and I gave up an hhr which was getting 33 per gal. Not a happy camper. I fell like trading it in but would take too much of a hit.

It is BACK at the dealership and they can't figure out why it keeps coming on. Changed coils and wire and not happy that I am driving a G6. I bought the G3 for better gas - but so far, I am spending more money on the loaner car this year than I would've saved keeping my other car. If they can fix this, I will be happy very happy. "

pontiac,g5,2007,DC, 08/06/2006,Great Car,5,"I just purchased my 2006 Pontiac Pursuit G5 (we had it in Canada before the U.S), and I absolutely love it.  The 2.2 litre mated to the 4 speed automatic is just great.  It shifts smoothly, and has plenty of power to spare.  The interior quality is superior to any prior gm products, and the silver-colored accents on the dash board give the interior an upscale feel.  Furthermore the stock radio/CD player is very good (considering the price of the car).  In addition to that, the trunk is of a decent size, although the opening is a bit narrow.  As far as road handling capabilities, the G5 soaks up any frost heaves and cracks in the road, transfering very little noise into the car."
pontiac,g5,2007,pobaldwin, 01/04/2013,Great Little Car,3,"Our 2007 G5 has the 2.2l and 4 speed automatic transmission. This car has about 165,000 miles on it and is still going strong. Being that we live in Michigan the suspension takes a beating, but components dont seam to wear out any faster than they will on any other car. The engine and transmission still feel strong and neither has ever had a leak. The gas mileage is fantastic, we can get about 36.5 MPG driving with the cruise set around 70 MPH with the A/C on in the summer time."

It had 127,000 miles on it when I bought it in 2013. Its still has all factory equipment except for the headlights, battery, brakes, rotors and tires. It runs like a top.  As of today, 6/21/2019, my G5 has 300,117  ORIGINAL MILES ON IT!! I drive it everyday back and forth to work and to do my running on. These are highway and city miles.

It's a deer magnet  lol, I have hit 8 deer on it in the last 4 years and the only thing I had to change is the headlights. I've changed oil faithfully in it and only had to put antifreeze in it 3 times in the last 6 years. I have changed the brakes 4 times in 6 years and rotors 2 times. It's paint job is still excellent, no fading or peeling. Sunroof doesn't leak, seats are still in great shape, no tears or holes, all electrical  things still work. It's an automatic, super radio system and speakers, large trunk. I cudnt have asked for a better car!! It's an AWESOME car. I wudnt be afraid to take a trip on it. I've babied her and shes my baby.

It's sporty, great gas mileage I average 21 mpg every day to and from work and I work 35 to 40 miles from home. These are definitely not the 4 cylinders of old. The motor has power I never expected. It's fast and it's sharp!! I like the looks I get when I pull in somewhere. No one has even seen this car yet and I have been told several times that it looks like a GTO at first glance, that's sweet. My GT has an awesome interior design. I love this car and I am very lucky to have it. Thanks Pontiac!!"
pontiac,g5,2007,Brendan McRobie, 07/13/2016,Great first car but has it's own cons,4,"I got this car for my first car and I can pretty much say I love it. I got it used with two previous owners that didn't take care of it it seems. I purchased it and have drove it a lot. I found it needed a fan, sunroof drain pipe fixed, and now it needs new struts. The dealership fixed everything and hopefully will fix the struts. But all of that are used car problems especially when the last owner(s) didn't take much care of it. I love my car. Has everything that comes with it. I don't know if they are added features or if the GT comes with all of it. Sadly mine is an automatic tho. I love the pioneer audio, the heated seats, the sunroof, everything. It's a beautiful car and gives a powerful burst when on the gas even tho it's only a small ecotech 4 cylinder. And when I go to fill it halfway up because that's when I always do. Never let it get below half is my way and I always fill it till it's full. I spend only $13. Some cons that I noticed are the doors swing pretty far out. Not a con but the con is they can sometimes swing open with small force so I'm constantly telling people be careful. Another con. Doors and trunk hit hard. When closing the doors and trunks the seem to slam. Doors I have no idea why but the trunk because the spoiler weighs a lot. Another con involving the trunk is the spoiler being heavy. Not so much a con but makes it hard to open the trunk because when pushing the button to release it it doesn't pop up very far and I don't like using the spoiler. One con is that it doesn't shift until the rpms are pretty high. Unless that's my way of driving. You may get better shifts and better gas mileage where I'm averaging only 20mpg where it should get 25-30. Those cons aren't that big of a deal but the worst con I have and the thing that I hate the most is the turn radius. You don't want to make a u-turn unless you are clear for a long distance. You may need to back up. I have a fairly big highway to u turn on and sometimes I'm still scared. I can barely back into my driveway because where everyone turns into to back into the driveway or back out. It's a pit filled in with gravel and I always end up in the wooded part behind it. So that's my review on the Pontiac G5. I love it but be careful turning always.

pontiac,g5,2007,chicagogt, 07/17/2008,I love my GT,4,"I've had my GT for a little over a year without any problems. The gray metallic paint, coupe styling, spoiler and 17"" brushed aluminum wheels get lots of compliments. It's fun to drive and I appreciate the maneuverability in city driving. City mileage is just fair, but I just returned from a road trip and got a little over 36 mpg on the highway. A little too much wind noise on the highway - but less than in my co-worker's 2007 Camry!

He wanted something economical on gas so we looked around and found a 2007 G5. WHAT A MISTAKE!!!  This has got to be the most uncomfortable car I've ever sat in, especially on long drives.  It shakes and rattles and so far the brakes, tires, rotors,control arm have had to be replaced.  The windshield wipers are useless and the road noise is horrible.  We've only had it a year.  I drive a 2003 Neon with no options at all and it is a far superior car to the G5.  My gas mileage is even better than the G5  Pontiac needs to go back to the drawing board with this one."

Before the end of the year had door panel fixed (it was cracked) door handle inside was peeling, button on shifter knob and on shifter shaft both peeled,very slow acceleration,blower motor had to be fixed,speaker doesn't work in driver's door anymore,leak stain on my head liner by windshield, had to fix lower control arm bushings (after only a year), rims started peeling, center caps fell out, i am the only one ever in my car and the passenger door is cracked now, love the spoiler since i drive on the highway a lot ( it blocks the bright headlights from shining in my face)paid $18,000 and now only worth $5,000 and it is in great shape besides miles on it."
pontiac,g5,2007,Karen P., 08/26/2006,My new G5,5,"I have had my G5 for two weeks now and this is an excellent vehicle in so many ways! I had the Vibe before this and the G5 has a lot of zip and is GREAT on gas! The black interior is very sharp and the bright yellow paint provokes all kinds of comments from people when I drive around. I have the 1st one sold in my small city and I couldn't be more pleased!!  I choose to buy American made vehicles, have driven in similar sized imports that belong to friends and this GM car is FAR superior!! The 12 months of XM, music downloads and cool interior accents are just an awesome bonus!! "
pontiac,g5,2007,07G5gt, 09/06/2006,what a great car,5,i just bought the G5 GT with the 5 speed tranny and i love the car. the power its got the sound of the muffler when you hit the gas is the best. it rides so smooth and the cabin has very little road sound comeing in. the sound system in that car is very nice with the 10 inch sub in the trunk and the XM radio free for the first year. i got the orange sunburst color and people always are telling me how nice it looks. i found a nice car and i'm very happy with it good job pontiac!
pontiac,g5,2007,Kim, 09/18/2006,G5 is a great car,5,What a fun car to drive!  This is a nice car that is a 4 cylinder but seems like a 6 cylinder.  It has a great suspension system and handles bumps and curves nicely! It doesn't hesitate to get up and go when necessary!
pontiac,g5,2007,Pontiac G5, 10/17/2006,Great car,4,"I love this car, i got it as my first car and i love the features i got. Its a really fun car to drive and i recommend it."
pontiac,g5,2007,lco, 01/16/2007,noises inside,4,"I love my car, but not long after buying it things started rattling inside.  My husband's Pontiac does that, too.  Does anyone else think the interior of Pontiac's just doesn't hold together very tightly?"
pontiac,g5,2007,Peter Harris, 09/11/2017,Good car with minor problems,4,"The front wheel bearings went just two years after buying the car.  There was a minor electrical problem with the radiator fan.  And, just recently, after ten years, the three major electrical components failed:  battery, alternator, and starter.   Also, there seems to be an ongoing issue related to the fuel tank pressure and fuel vent solenoid. Peter Harris
"
pontiac,g5,2007,BJ, 12/08/2009,Nice car but bad gas mileage,3,"Bought this car because of the price, not a bad car but the gas mileage is horrendous GM advertises 5.2ltr per 100kms I wish, I'm lucky if I get 7.4ltr per 100kms. They also state you will get 952kms per tank. I get maybe 550kms. My 3.8ltr impala is better on fuel than the g5. I will never ever buy GM again. With today's technology there's no reason why a 4 cyl engine should get less than 1000kms to a tank of gas."
pontiac,g5,2007,Beverly, 10/07/2006,Great Coupe,5,"Vehicle runs nice and some, takes bumps in the road just fine. Takes turns really well and have not had a problem yet. Front seats have plenty of room for people with long legs"
pontiac,g5,2007,Turbo Durby, 10/13/2006,Bumblebee w/4 cyl sounds like V6!,5,"This is my 4th Pontiac purchase and the smallest one yet - but not the slowest!  The GT trim definitely outguns and is better handling than my '01 Grand Am SE, which was a 4-cyl. as well.  Though the Monsoon system is a little complicated to work at 1st, the steering controls make it much simpler!  And the acceleration in such a slight car is awesome!"
pontiac,g5,2007,Betty, 12/23/2006,My Pontiac G5,4,"My G5 is so sweet, she drives so well.The pickup in my G5, I'd never know it was a 4 cyl. The pickup is great and all turns and u turns are remarkable.My G5 is so perfect for me. I sit in drivers seat high & can see great.I have to be careful not to get a speeding ticket,my G5 flies so fast I can't believe it;s a 4 cyl."
pontiac,g5,2007,Brian, 10/28/2006,Needs More Power,3,"I wish I didn't buy this car.  The Cobalt SS is about the same price and a much better performer.   The G5 is a good look decent all around car, but just don't offer the kind of performance it should at the selling price."
pontiac,g5,2007,Matthew Oliver, 02/15/2010,Nothing But Trouble,2,"Everyone in my area that has a G5 has the same trouble.My car has 40000kms and I t has been back for strut boots,linkage kits in front end twice,brake trouble which they cant seem to figure out what is causing it,heater blower motor twice,door strikers on both sides,manual transmission shifter trouble,control arm bushings,Electric motor coil(which was only fixed for a couple of days now causing trouble again)radio and signal lights come on and off on their own(no one seems to know why)overall I would recommend to stay away from it.I was told by the dealership that the G6 has the same troubles so stay away from that too.My father has a 2000 Mazda Protege brought new and never had a hitch yet."
pontiac,g5,2007,Pat, 09/26/2006,Excellent Car,5,The Pontiac G6 is an excellent car.  So far I have had no problems with my car.  
pontiac,g5,2007,Tom, 01/25/2010,Sorry,2,"My G5 has been in the shop 6 times since i bought it in December 07 with the same problem.  Radio has staic rpm fluxuates, tires blown out, gas milage droped from 35 mpg to 27 mpg the first 2 months.  I will never buy another GM product.  I'll stick with my good dependable FORDS.  Dealer still can't fix the car. They just keep reprograming it."
pontiac,g5,2007,BlueShark13, 01/13/2007,Favorite Car Yet,4,"A fun car to drive. It's very sporty and has great pickup for only having a 4cylinder. My fiance is always bugging me to let her drive it as well. Overall, a great car and my favorite yet of the 4 cars I have owned."
pontiac,g5,2007,Rhonda, 06/01/2008,"If you drive it too much, it gets less fun",3,"I loved this car at first.  I still love the way it looks.  However, I spilled fruit juice in the car and the gear shifter had TO BE REPLACED.  The front of the car rattles.  My steering shaft went out.  My rotors are cheap and will soon need to replace them with made in the USA steel I've been told by guys at work because they are constantly wearing down even though I don't drive it irresponsibly.  I drive 120 miles a day, and I wish I bought a foreign made car, because the rattling in the front of the car is really starting to scare me.  This car will be worthless when I finally pay it off.  It looks great, buy maybe good looks aren't everything.  The feel of the drive really deteriorated."
pontiac,g5,2007,StalePhish, 07/12/2008,Finally a good deal,4,"After countless used cars, I finally decided to get a new car, and what a fabulous decision I made to buy a brand new Pontiac G5. Keeping price in mind, I went with the base model, which still has great performance and equally impressive looks. My personal record average was 38.7 MPG in medium/light traffic on the interstate for an hour. Unlike most other cars I have driven, the headrests are actually effective and the seats are amazingly comfortable. For being over 6 feet tall, I have more than enough leg room and my head doesn't ever bump the ceiling. The interior controls are clustered intuitively and to my taste. "
pontiac,g5,2007,Todd, 07/21/2008,Not so happy,2,"I have had this car for almost 6 months now and it has been in the shop four times.  The windshield makes noise, like wind is coming in somewhere.  The front end has had the bearings replaced, the struts, and the rotors have already been turned, and need to be done again.  I noticed if the car sits for more than a week, the rotors are totally shot.  Is this something that anyone else is having problems with?  I'm also not happy with the noise in the car, all the plastic is coming loose already.  I actually own a Honda Civic Si, and I haven't had any problems with it, as well as my Scion TC.  I wish I wouldn't  have bought this car, but thankfully I purchased an extended warranty!!!!"
pontiac,g5,2007,D - Nasty, 08/29/2008,Wanna Race?,4,"I've had my G5 for about 8 months now and I really like it. The power is there when you want it, and when you need it. It's real fun to take a sharp turn with, or fit in tight squeezes while switching lanes. The gas is very good, especially when going highway. I drive it every single day and every time I fill up my gas tank someone always comments on how nice my car is. White G5 GT with Custom 18"" Black Racing Rims, with 40 meat kumho tires and 20% window tint all the way around."
pontiac,g5,2007,j9atv, 09/13/2008,Went good to bad within a year,3,"Don't get me wrong all cars have their issues but the list is starting to grow on my new 2007 G5. So far within the first year and 35,000 km (21,000 miles) I've had the fuel sensor and pump replaces, the rear bushings on both front suspension replaced, the radio replaced 4x!! because the original radio that came with the car at the time of purchase was black and the company that GM gets to do the warranty work does not carry radios with black faces (on going issue). So far I'm really not impressed with the quality of my G5 and I'm just waiting for the next thing to go wrong. I can tell you this my next car will not be a GM (BMW, Acura, Honda). It's sad because everyone in my family owns a GM."
pontiac,g5,2007,Brooke, 09/26/2008,"I love my G5, but...",4,"Don't get me wrong, I love my G5. Love the exterior looks. Black leather, heated seats (That's what sold me.) But the windshield wipers are horrible, I can see better without turning them on. Rear spoiler blocks view, but you get used to it. I don't how anyone gets 36 mpg with it. I get 21 in the city(moderate traffic) and the best i have ever gotten is 26 on hwy. (I'm delicate with my car). And biggest concern, only after 30k mi. Both of my front tires blew out, on the same day. It was like something cut them in a perfect circle on the inside of the tire. I was stuck in BFE Arkansas at a gas station. Dangerous! also having problems with my remote keyless entry"
pontiac,g5,2007,Andy, 10/24/2008,Great car!,4,"I've had my G5 GT for almost a year and a half and love it. It is always a head turner, and hardly anyone else has one. The only problems I've had is a broken sunroof switch, replaced under warranty, and a glitch in the keyless entry that others have noted. This was my first new car, and I couldn't be happier."
pontiac,g5,2007,Tony Milo, 01/01/2009,Crash Input,4,"I owned my G5 for a little over a year, no problems & is used for a commuter back & forth to work. The best mileage I got was a little over 32 with the automatic. The second week of Dec/08 I was driven to work when a 05/G6 made a left hand turn in front of me. I was doing about 40mph & never had the chance to hit the brakes. I was wearing my seat belt & the air bag deployed, I was knocked out, fortunately when I came to I was basically OK. I did sustain some injuries,but nothing major! The G5 did sustain almost $6k  in left front damage tho. So I was a crash test dummy & lived to write about it! My G5 should be repaied the second week of Jan/09. Thank's GM for a safe car! "
pontiac,g5,2007,Miss Unhappy!, 01/07/2009,What a lemon!,2,"What a disappointment this car has been! We purchased this G5, hoping that it would be similar in quality as the Pontiac Sunfire that we had previously driven. Not even close! We have always had a problems with the keys, to the point we can't even open our doors or trunk, and now the key won't even start the car! It's still under warranty but yet the dealership has chosen to spray my ignition with rustcheck instead of addressing the real problem, the keys! From months of juggling both of our keys to either get the doors opened and now to start the car, I guess the problems start now! Both keys are so worn out just from one year of driving. I also can't stand the noise whilst driving!"
pontiac,g5,2007,pdxbob, 02/12/2009,12 Month Review,4,"I am in my 60's and have a degree in mechanical engineering. Bought this car new as a one year old model from the dealer's lot. First, the price was incredibly good, with 3 rebates piggybacked. After driving it for 12 months, I have no problems with it, except for one thing, it started bucking when I floored the gas pedal above 50 mph. Before taking it in to dealer, I poured a can of fuel injector cleaner in gas tank, and voila, it is running better than ever. Canceled dealer appointment! Power is very adequate for every day driving, the 4 banger engine is willing and able to rev up as much as needed without getting noisy. Love this car for economy & fun of driving. "
pontiac,g5,2007,Krista, 02/22/2009,Pontiac Hits A Home-Run!,5,"I have owned my G5 for almost 2 years now. I absolutely love this vehicle. The handling is great. Purchased $15k, the car feels like a luxury car. The seats are comfortable, and gas mileage is great! I average 25/city and at at 75mph I get 36/37 mpg freeway! The car quickly becomes like an extension of yourself on the road."
pontiac,g5,2007,snookers, 02/27/2009,Excellent Car,5,"I purchased my Pontiac G5 in 2007.  I would not trade her for the world. Everyone assumes i spent alot more then i did on her. With the extra money i saved purchasing her, i was able to get the windows tinted and she looks sharper then any foreign car out there.  She looks and sounds great with the exhaust tip i was also able to purchase with the fuel savings i enjoy. If you want a REAL deal, look into and purchase a G5.  You will never be sorry..."
pontiac,g5,2007,JIm, 01/04/2008,"Excellent Car and Built in the USA, A+++",5,"I had the car for almost a year now, no problems and love it. The car rides and handles great, even at high speeds it's a smooth ride. The turning radius is excellent, I can pull a u-turn just about anywhere and park in the smallest places. (I tried the Chevy Cobolt GT and it does not do this and they are suppose to be the same?) Great MPG 36 mpg, with automatic. Very Quite inside, not air noises, road noise. Great dash, XM radio, mp3 connection. Nice styling, inside and out.  Beat all the imports.  We have the base module with the confort package, and sport package that may be the difference between ours and other ratings.  Great looking 18 in mag wheels, controls on the leather wraped wheel"
pontiac,g5,2007,kenneth tennison, 06/13/2009,One of the best small vehicles GM has,5,"I purchased a 07 G5 for my son,at the age of 17 for school and collage.The vehicle has 53,000 miles.The only problem so far,was a small gas leak,at the top of the gas tank.Which was replaced under warranty by GM (goodwill policy).The vehicle is very reliable and safe.I will buy only GM."
pontiac,g5,2007,PM, 06/17/2009,Great but...,4,"I love it - bought it brand new in '07, but it's only 2 yrs old with 23K miles & already running like my old 10 yr Chevy Cavalier! So I took it back to dealer for service; whoa, it needed 2 arm controls, a stabilizer and 3 wheel bearing - all still under warranty thank God! I asked them how much life expectancy for this vehicle, and he said that they do keep certain parts in stock for this model. I am very concerned and already considering trading it in. "
pontiac,g5,2007,Grotonems5, 06/25/2009,Great car but...,4,"Great overall car, I don't like cars but this is a nice mid-priced car, sporty, handles nice, but I have had MAJOR problems every time I take it to the shop and have anything to do with the brakes or hubs.  New front rotors at 15000 miles, the g5 rotors didn't fit.. had to get g6 rotors, then a wheel bearing went in the back, have to get a whole new hub assembly, again g5 part didn't fit, had to get g6 part and now my abs and traction control don't work...  also had to have some bushings in the front replaced 3 times!!!  and my rear defroster never works.  and they fixed it twice."
pontiac,g5,2007,Meg, 07/08/2009,Disappointed in my Pontiac :/,3,"I have had my g5 gt for 2 years now and it has given me nothing but trouble!! dont get me wrong i love my lil bumble bee!! shes fast and cute and has appealing features! but its not worth it!! so far i have had a blown amp, replaced a/c, replaced radio for AUX jack, power steering failed while driving on the highway!, and most recently a gas leak w/ noise coming from front driver side and a starter elated issues!! i love my car but im just dissapointed that all this has happened...i never drive far with her nor take her on tough roads...it makes no sense....guess i just have bad luck.. but good thing i have a 10 yr warranty or I'd be screwed!! goodluck!! :/"
pontiac,g5,2007,Jimbo, 08/03/2009,Big Mistake,1,"Haven't had a GM product in about 15 years, daughter needed a car for school and the price was right so i bought the G5, what a mistake, has been in the shop twice in less than a year for new rear axel and rear suspension failure covered under warranty. but i need a reliable car not a reliable warranty.  Should have gotten a honda.  I'm so stuck with this it's not funny."
pontiac,g5,2007,tray, 08/28/2009,All around good car,4,"I have had my G5 Coupe SE for two years now, and have had no problems but one small wire chaffing for my a/c. It has been an all around good car. I do wish the seats were more comfortable, on long trips especially. The trunk opening could be a bit bigger. Overall it's been a good car."
pontiac,g5,2007,tu, 08/25/2006,Solid Car,5,"I am a current owner of the G5 GT. I am very satisfied with the car. The power of the GT engine actually works well with the auto transmission. This is my first car ever to not be a manual. The best part about the car is the handling. The sport tuned suspension of the GT combined with the electronic power steering can really hold the road. All GM cars I have driven before as rentals felt like I was driving a boat. The GT does not. It handles well, feels solid and secure, and allows for quick and nimble driving. Overall the car is a solid buy. Good power, handling, looks, and comfort for the price."
pontiac,g5,2007,Michell Obrochta, 08/29/2006,Blue Streak Dream,5,I purchased my G5 on 8/28/06. So far I am very impressed. This 4 cylinder engine is very powerful. Shifting is very smooth with the 4 speed automatic transmission. I live in a very hilly area in New York state and have had no problems getting up these hills. If you have looked at this car then take a second look. Breathtaking!!!
pontiac,g5,2007,Frank Forehand, 09/10/2006,my G5,5,"Very pleased with G5.  Nice size, fun to drive.  Wish gas mileage was closer to 30 around town."
pontiac,g5,2007,Brian, 09/16/2006,Black Beauty,5,"What a great car for the price.  I wanted to ""Buy American"" and couldn't be more pleasantly surprised with Pontiac's newest offering.  Sporty looks, comfortable ride, nimble handling, and great gas mileage from a quiet, smooth, peppy engine.  It has all the features I was looking for, many unexpected on a car at this price point.  Leather, heated seats, On-Star, and the Pioneer sound system with the ipod input jack are all great in this class of car. "
pontiac,g5,2007,Silver Wolf, 10/03/2006,Love My New G5,5,I purchased my new Pontiac G5 on 9/30/06 and I love it!  It is fun to drive and handles really well.  The CD/radio sound is especially awesome.  It is easy to park in small spaces with the manual transmission.  
pontiac,g5,2007,Matt , 10/14/2006,Great Drive,4,"I was skeptical in buying this car since it was only out for a month or so when I bought it...But after I did I was very satisfied with my decison.  The seats take a little time to get comfortable to.  Acceleration and gas mileage are great.  For me, the as mileage is peaking at 25 mpg for light highway, mostly city driving which is average.  The handling is great too."
pontiac,g5,2007,computernut21, 12/30/2006,Simply Amazing,5,"I couldn't have been more pleased with this car.  For the price you simply can't do any better.  The G5 has great power, awesome features and looks very sporty.  I would recommend this car to anyone I know.  "
pontiac,g5,2007,Amanda, 01/09/2007,My new G5,4,I love my new G5 it is fun to drive. I have a new Dodge Ram as well so I get the best of both worlds. I wanted something sporty and fun to drive. I found it.
pontiac,g5,2007,Chris, 01/31/2007,A lot better than a Cobalt,4,"The engine is a bit thrashy while its being gunned.  The gas mileage is superb for a 4 cylinder that makes this kind of power.  Overall a great value compared to the Tiburon GT, Civic Si, and Mazda 3s.  "
pontiac,g5,2007,Stephanie, 02/22/2007,First Car,4,"The new Pontiac G5 was bought for me as my first car. It rides so smoothly for a small car and i love it. My car is blue streak metallic and i live how in the sun it almost looks purplish! it's fun and sporty and is great for anyone, especially teenagers!!"
pontiac,g5,2007,michelle barrett, 03/01/2007,metallic blue nights,5,"i wanted a sporty car , but needed a family car. I got both when i bought this car 7 days ago. It has everything a family of 5 could need and all the sportiness a single woman or man could want. I would not trade this car for anything in the world."
pontiac,g5,2007,Stryker, 03/02/2007,Excellent Car!,5,"This is my first brand new car, and I couldn't be happier.  The engine performs great on the highway, as well as in the city.  The heated leather seats are nice in the cold Colorado weather.  And it handles better than most cars I've driven.  I can't think of another car that even compares to this one in the same price range.  "
pontiac,g5,2007,JB29MD, 03/07/2007,Still Impressed,4,"I purchased my G5 (Manual Trans.) in September of '06. 6 months later, I am still impressed. The fuel economy is outstanding. All of my miles are interstate/highway miles, and tank after tank I average 34-36 mpg.  The pickup is sweet. Turns are remarkably easy and U turns still make me smile. Great car for the money."
pontiac,g5,2007,CMG673, 04/23/2007,Nice,5,"This is the first new car that I have ever owned. I have the GT with premium package. It is fun to drive, and I have had no problems with it yet. I drive a long way to work, and this car is great on gas. If you are thinking about it, go test drive one and fall in love."
pontiac,g5,2007,rickston, 05/08/2007,Great Little Car!,5,So far this car has been fun to drive. Very comfortable for a small car and great features available in this class. GM has definitely improved upon their product quality!
pontiac,g5,2007,kyyankee7, 05/29/2007,Super car for the money!,5,"I've had this car for about a week, so long term details obviously aren't here. But I've absolutely loved it. I had already bought a G6 earlier this year and was looking to get another, but the style and color I wanted was sold just before I got to the dealer. Looking around the lot I saw the G5, a 5 speed, very basic model. I hadn't driven a stick in years, but I found it immediately easy and fun to drive. The bottom line is this: needing 2 cars to replace aged ones, we were able to get a G5 and G6 for about the price of a Hummer's front end suspension! Can't recommend them too much."
pontiac,g5,2007,ptg, 05/27/2007,Don't waste your money,3,"I bought this car with high hopes getting out of a high price for repair VW. Well good thing this car came with a great warranty because I used it 4 times already. My clutch had a manufacturing defect which made it pop off the plate twice leaving me stranded. So they put in a new clutch plate. Then my rotors went at 9000 miles and had to be resurfaced, which they called normal. I've had cars go 30k and not need that. This car just feels poorly made overall. It's peppy for a 4 banger but the handling is too loose and the transmission shifts awkwardly rough compared to my old cars. I really wouldn't waste your money. I'll definitely never buy another Pontiac again. "
pontiac,g5,2007,shannon wasson, 06/07/2007,G5 review,5,Overall impressed so far. Handles a little different from the car I traded in. Gas mileage excellent. Overall value for money A+
pontiac,g5,2007,RRRR, 06/26/2007,Not a very good design.,1,I have owned this car for about two weeks and have driven it about 1000 miles. The car sounds like it has a window open when driven over 45mph. You can hear the air rush over the radio it is so bad. The steering wheel has shaking problems when I step on the breaks.  The trunk opening is very small which is a drawback to the big space inside it. I was promised a cruise control for it only to find the EVS dealer is putting on an aftermarket version with no warranty.  This car is a terrible car in all of these respects.
pontiac,g5,2007,07g5gt, 07/22/2007,I love this car,5,"This is my sec time posting about my car. I first posted when I got the car. Now I have had the car a year and it has 10k on it. I just took my car on vacation and we drove over 3000 miles in less then 3 days. On the highway with 4 people in the car, all our stuff in the trunk and the ac on max I got 32.5 mpg at 75 mph. After I got back I wanted to run the car at the track to see its 1/4 time so I did and with me, my uncle and a full tank of gas, it ran a 15.7 at 88 mph. This car has taken all the abuse I have given it and with it being my first 5-speed car ever it's been one hell of a car. It's never been in for warranty work and I definitely will be buying another Pontiac after this one."
pontiac,g5,2007,06G5GT, 08/03/2007,Good car but room for improvement,4,"My 1st car and just clicked over 13000k and so far the car has been good through the summer and very reliable in winnipeg's -40 weather.Brakes rust really badly and look terrible behind the revealing rims.This car is tough to upgrade power wise without putting alot of money into it,it can handle bolt ons but anything more and you will need new injectors and a tune that will void your warrenty.Premium fuel is recommended and it shouldn't run without it if u want optimum performance, but with the price of gas its getting harder to afford the extra 10-15 cents per liter.Gas mileage is so so i get about 24mpg all city.Overall very good car in 5 speed very fun and i recommend it! "
pontiac,g5,2007,Sloley, 08/22/2007,Fun and sporty,4,"I have had this car for almost a week and I really enjoy driving it. It's really great on gas. I still have not been to the gas station since I bought the car. I commute from Maryland to DC everyday, so far with 4 trips I'm just below half tank. "
pontiac,g5,2007,Nik, 08/10/2007,Great Car!,4,"I traded in a 1995 Pontiac Grand Am for this car. What a deal!  The car rides great and met my expectations. I read previous reviews of this car and agree with what people said, good and bad."
pontiac,g5,2007,Jessica, 08/23/2007,My G5,5,"I bought my G5 a week ago and love it. I love everything about the car. The way it drives, the way it rides, absolutely everything. I could have not picked a better car for myself. And the price for a brand new car was amazing. Not to bad."
pontiac,g5,2007,Kyle D Kelly, 05/27/2007,Amazing!,5,"I purchased this car because it was the right price. I bought it stock, empty, and it came with cruise and all power and everything. I love the car it handles real well. The rims are great stock, not cheap. I drove a Miata and miss the convertible but I am getting an installed moonroof. It is a great car to drive and I can fill up for $35 and get 300 miles. It is a looker and I love attention. If you dont like attention, dont get yellow. I test drove many, and the stick GT is the way to go, great buy."
pontiac,g5,2007,Bad Experience, 07/01/2007,Terrible Pontiac experience,1,The Pontiac G5 coupe that I purchased and drove for two weeks has problems. The wind noise in the car is terrible. You can hear the wind noise above the radio when driving at speeds above 50 mph. I had warped rotors on the car that cause the steering wheel to shake upon braking. The trunk opening space is very small and makes things difficult to put in. 
pontiac,g5,2007,Roger Fitch, 09/14/2007,Pontiac G5 - Not bad for GM,4,Car has enough pep. Interior is simple and clear to understand. Exterior is cool. I have only driven 250 miles. So cant talk about reliablity etc.
pontiac,g5,2007,megang, 05/30/2007,Excellent,5,I wanted a vehicle that would be reliable as well as stylish. When I started the buying process I didn't know exactly what I wanted. I knew however that i wanted something sporty that got as much flatter from other people as it did gas mileage. I got that and more. It's so comfortable it makes your driving experience wonderful.
pontiac,g5,2007,2nd childhood, 07/09/2007,Just good sense and plain fun,4,"I have had my cometition yellow G5 for over 3 months now, and this car really rocks. When I drive like a gentleman, with cruise control set to 57 mph, I get better then 43 MPG! I have a few packages with the car, #1 being the sunroof which includes an upgraded sound system (bass reflex port in trunk) and XM radio included for a full year. Just a wonderful experience for a guy who will never buy an import. GM got its act together quite well with this car. More trunk space then expected plus pass through to interior cabin was handy. The 16 inch tire/mag wheel combo helps hold the road."
pontiac,g5,2007,lrymal, 07/06/2007,Simply amazing!,4,"I have this fun little car for almost a month now. Basically, it is as everyone else has said and if I were to fault this car at all, it would be for the interior plastics. The plastics are easy to scratch. Easy. I mean, you don't mean, but you look, and you see you scratched something. What did it, a coin? Ring? Finger nail? The design layout of the plastic pieces is good, and that is cause of the scratching. There's a cubby hole for pens, an area to lay the iPod, lots of nice areas to lay thing, but that is how the scratches occur. I gave it ""5"" for interior design due to this."
pontiac,g5,2007,KH, 08/05/2007,Happy Owner,5,"After a month, we've got 2000 miles and am really convinced it's the right car for me. We went planning to get another G6 but decided to check out the less expensive G5. I'm 6'4"" and didn't really think it would work out for me but it does! I even had room in the one with the sunroof! Tight handler, roomy for 2 plus luggage and getting better than EPA rated 32 mpg. Have to watch it though, it sneaks up to 80 mph real easily!"
pontiac,g5,2007,Gerald Rogers, 08/04/2007,Excellent car! I'd buy again,4,"The price was great, and the economy is typical of a 4 cylinder (hi 20s in town, mid 30s highway---regular gasoline). I don't see a compelling reason to go Japanese any more if vehicles like these continue being offered.  Interior for me as the driver centers on ease of getting to the radio, ample opportunities of getting the iPOD connected to my radio, simple reach for the HVAC.  Mine is the coup and blind spots abound, as others have probably noted.  I would have no problem buying this car again."
pontiac,g5,2007,Stan, 09/01/2007,Get in your Pontiac and ride!,5,"We looked at and tried a lot of cars, but didn't care for them.  My wife suggested that we go to a Pontiac dealer and see what they had.  I had never seen a G5, didn't know they existed.  The G5 is a real sleeper.  It makes you want to throw rocks at the other cars, especially those overrated Asian cars that people are so proud of. Phooey!  When I saw the American G5, I knew it was right. I was so certain about this car that I bought it outright without driving it first. My wife and I love it. It's everything we want in a car. We are so glad that we found it.  This sport coupe has class. The boring Asian cars have no more charm than kitchen appliances."
pontiac,g5,2007,KMMACK, 10/03/2007,Best Sub compact ever,4,"The car handles great, even at high speeds it's a smooth ride. I can pull a u-turn just about anywhere and park in the smallest places. When I baby it I can get over 35 mpg and so far I haven't dropped below 32. When it's cold out I can hear a rattle coming from the front passenger side, I don't know what it is but it hasn't been a problem. My car suprises everyone with it's speed. It's no race car, but for it's class it's impressive. I can easily turn em over in second gear with 3 passengers."
pontiac,g5,2007,kcwilson05, 10/15/2007,Very nice ride!,5,"This car drives great and rides very smooth. The interior is very sleek and with the black and chrome, it just can't be beat! Overall, this car is wonderful. It handles very good and the gas mileage is great as well. "
pontiac,g5,2007,Kristin, 10/29/2007,Brand new car troubles.,4,"Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love my 2007 Pontiac G5. But now it is starting to have problems already and it hasn't even been five months since I bought it brand new off the lot. I'm not sure if it is just my car experiencing these problems or if there are others, but there are not any recalls about leaks. Two months after I bought the car, the front windshield leaks. We just recently had a big rainstorm, I go look in my trunk and there is a good 3 inches of standing water in my trunk surrounding my battery. Other than these problems, which shouldn't be happening, this car is a great choice for my first car. Nice and smooth riding."
pontiac,g5,2007,eyc51k, 11/18/2007,Good Choice,5,"I bought two vehicles in 07 this G5 and a mid size SUV. I drive 135 miles daily and picked this G5 over the smaller foreign brands for my commute. I am an old man compared to the kids driving this car. Have been driving 40 years and owned as many vehicles. I love this car all around.Handling, ride, and mileage obtained. At 80 MPH I get 30 MPG and at legal speeds on the interstate as high as 37.7 MPG! Power is good. Love the XM & seat comfort setting as low as it can go. I am 5 11 215lbs and perfectly comfortable driving three hours daily.  Good choice no regrets at 22K and climbing fast."
pontiac,g5,2007,Allison, 04/16/2008,Horrible,3,"I  have had my G5 for about 6 months now and I love the car but have had MANY problems with it. My dad works at the dealership I bought it from as a mechanic. I have had it in there for a number of problems. Sunroof button kept falling out, coolant leak (4 times for that problem), Oil leak was the recent one. None of them are because of my driving, the car has 8,000 miles on it there is NO reason for this to be happening. Other then that its a great car. Sort of a small backseat when using a car seat for an infant in back but what can you expect with a small coupe. The truck opening is also WAY small, Big truck but small opening"
pontiac,g5,2007,07g5, 04/27/2008,2007 G5,4,I have had my 2dr coupe for almost a year now and overall it is a good car.  I have never had maintenance done on my car except for necessary oil changes. I do not have any problems with seeing through the back window because of the rear spoiler like a lot of other people have mentioned. I actually think the spoiler gives the car a more sporty look.  Some people may not like the firm seats but personally I find them quite comfortable. The car accelerates well considering the 4 cylinder and is a great around town driver.  I would not however recommend this car for someone who does a lot of highway driving as it is very light on the road and tends to sway because of the loose steering.
pontiac,g5,2007,Jenna, 05/02/2008,Hello Beautiful,5,"Every time I walk out my front door, I look at my 2007 Pontiac G5 and say ""Hello Beautiful!"" I love my car. The exterior is nice, the interior is easy to keep clean and I get great gas mileage for an automatic. I do a lot of highway driving (70 mph) and this car handles beautifully at high speeds. I have no problems getting up to speed to merge either. "
pontiac,g5,2007,ssunkissedd, 05/22/2008,i love my new 2 door pontiac 2007 G5,5,"I just got a yellow 2 door Pontiac G5. It's a 2007. I love this car. I've had it for 2 days now, an couldn't ask for a better car. Great fuel economy, XM radio, great pioneer sound system (stock), sun roof, great interior an exterior look. Its a good car all around. I use to have a 04 sunfire, but I'm absolutely in love with this car. An wouldn't trade it even for a Ferrari."
pontiac,g5,2007,nicman18, 05/25/2008,This car is sweet,4,This car was one of the most fun little compacts I have ever driven and I would take it over any import any day
pontiac,g5,2007,Dale Peeks, 08/05/2020,Love my little red car!,5,"I bought my G5 brand new in 2007. I now have 139,000  miles and is still running great. I have faithfully kept up the maintenance on it since I bought it. I did replace the A.C. Just 3 months ago because it started not holding a charge. Now I am in the process of changing the shocks and struts. I have no major problems with it at all just the normal wear and tear of everyday driving. This was the best money I have spent on a car. I did have a drink driver rear end me but the only damage you can see is on the inside of the trunk. The trunk is bowed in but has not taken away from the storage capacity. This is one tough little car. When I was hit I just knew the whole back was going to be smashed in. I was at a stop light and the driver did not even slow down before he hit me. Good thing he was only doing about 35mph. It hit hard enough to open my sunroof about 5 inches. I was shocked when I went to look at the damage and just saw a few scratches on the outside. Like I said it is a tough little car. It has held up really well considering I do not drive slow, especially on the highways. I love taking corners faster than you should cause it is so much fun. My nickname at work is Earnhardt. If they still made this little car, I would but another one in a minute!

pontiac,g5,2008,mike_sinclair, 07/31/2013,"reliable, economical car!",3,"bought the car in august of 2007 as an 08 model I've had this car for six years now and i am amazed, this is a great little economical car great in Canadian winters never had a problem no lights ever came on only thing that i had to replace is the sway bar (links)(my fault) only because I travel on a lot of bumpy roads and dirt roads a lot of the time and about 80% of my driving is city driving barely highway kms, the car has about 200,000 kms on it again never had any problems at all no noises or service lights never hesitated to start all ways started right up like the day I bought it, and i have to admit i don't take the best care of my cars it has a couple dents(me) very reliable car!!! "
pontiac,g5,2008,Linda, 05/26/2010,This Car Rocks,5,"After reading reviews I'm starting to think people just like to complain.  This car is great!  I have had mine for 2 years and other than one minor repair it has been extremely reliable.   It is one of the smoothest driving cars I've ever driven and everyone who drives it says the same.   The interior is comfy, no noise, no rattles, not cheap.   The back seat feels much larger than it looks and dips down giving more room for rear passengers.   Battery is in the trunk, no big deal. You can't generally open the hood without getting to the interior either.  I'm only 5'2"" and the seats adjust for short drivers perfectly!"
pontiac,g5,2008,Jesse B., 03/13/2016,Strong at 155k,5,"Bought this at 85k miles for $9,000 and 3 years later I'm at 155k miles running smooth with no major repairs. Only oil changes, a few new tires, tyranny flush, and 1 new battery. It feels like it will easily go past 200k miles with the same care. PROS: lots of space for a 2 door, great visibility, 30 mpg @ 80mph CONS: small opening @ trunk, big doors

pontiac,g5,2008,Heather, 08/09/2010,I LOVE my G5 GT,4,"I love the G5 GT! I have had mine for two years! It has been very reliable and is so much fun to drive! When I first test drove the car it was just a standard G5, I would recommend buying the GT. The handling of the car is a lot better and the performance is better as well. It comes with great stuff! The pioneer system! heated seats, remote start and its sporty looking! I get so many compliments on the car.  "
pontiac,g5,2008,LINZI, 03/04/2010,I Love my G5,4,"I have had my G5 for sometime now, and have had zero problem. I travel approx 30 min from home to work, and back each day, plus i do a lot of additional traveling aside from that, so with that said i am very happy with my car."
pontiac,g5,2008,Tony, 10/29/2015,Stop complaining,5,"I bought my car used almost 2 years ago with 50k miles. The people before me did a great job taking care of this car. I now have about 110k miles on it and it drives just as good as it did when i first got it. I like in Chicago and this car had been to Milwaukee, Indianapolis and st Louis a few times. The engine is still quiet and can barely tell the car is on sometimes. Basically anyone who knows how to take care of a vehicle shouldn't have many problems with it. 2yrs and never been to a shop or back to the dealership for anything. I'm 6'2 so my only issue is that i damn near sit in the backseat while driving and the steering wheel is the size of a Frisbee lol other than that the car runs great, has great gas mileage and reliable
"
pontiac,g5,2008,Ashley, 12/14/2007,Awesome Car for the money!,4,"In the time I have now owned my 2008 Pontiac G5, I have absolutely found nothing I have not liked about he vehicle.  It was a steal at the price, with the five year warranty, plus it has all the extras that I wouldn't have been able to afford if I had bought the competitor vehicles such as the chevy cobalt.  The car handles great, gets competative gas mileage, no better or worse than any other small car, and it is so quiet while running, and has great brakes in comoparison to other cars I have driven. It was definitely a great buy for my as a college student, but it wouldn't be something I would reccommend to a really tall person, as it would be too tiny, or someone with kids."
pontiac,g5,2008,RainaJoi, 06/19/2008,Ignition problem,4,"This is my second car. I bought it for the price and the fuel economy. I have a 5-speed and get 29mpg City. I would highly recommend it as a stylish alternative to the ""bubbly"" fuel economy cars. It rides beautifully and quietly for a standard. However, I have had it back to the dealer TWICE because of problems with the ignition and my keys not being recognized by the car. They said it was not a ""recall"" on the car, but there is a ""bulliten"" on this problem. So, beware."
pontiac,g5,2008,AMP, 08/03/2008,G5 - A Bargain,4,"I bought my G5 six months ago - so far, it has exceeded my expectations. My daily commute is 57 miles round-trip, 90% highway. I'm averaging 32.5 MPG, despite the 4-speed auto transmission. The 4-cyl Ecotec has plenty of power and the cabin is quiet for an economy car. The tire-pressure monitor alerted me to an air leak in one of my tires caused by a nail BEFORE I drove on the Interstate - very nice. The climate control system is excellent - HOT heat and COLD AC. I like the firm, supportive seats - like a VW's and very comfortable over long trips. If you like soft, cushy, couch cushions, this isn't the car for you."
pontiac,g5,2008,cam, 01/26/2010,Not a bad little car,4,I bought this car brand new in 08.  Definately an impulse buy.  The resale value is bad but that didnt bother me at first.  I drove it about 55000km the first year without any major problems.  Now had it for a year and a half and put 88000km on it with only oil changes every 5000k.  I do 98% highway driving and it does just fine.  Plus the dark blue color with 20% tint looks very sharp.
pontiac,g5,2008,Michelle, 06/14/2017,Forever!,5,"I bought the car with only 19 miles on it! It now has 245,000 miles and I've had it for 9 years! I went from a Power Stroke F-250 to this car and had never had a manual before, but I took right up with the car. It has been there for me every day! The only major things I have had to do to it is shocks and struts, water pump, thermostat, coolant cap and it had a rusted fuel line! I'd say that's pretty amazing! I truly don't want to sell it but for fanatical reasons I may have to fairly soon. It has even crossed my mind to replace it with the same or very similar car!
"
pontiac,g5,2008,SUnny2735, 01/06/2009,2008 Pontiac G5,1,"This car is good for someone buying their first new vehicle.  Other than that stay away from this car. The inside is plastic, and feels like its going to fall apart. The handling is crappy and that is putting it nicely. It is supposed to have about 148 HP but it feels like 100. The suspension is terrible. The road noise is outrageous and the radio signal is bad. You get static all the time."
pontiac,g5,2008,Heatherw, 07/12/2008,Lovin my G-5,5,"I bought my car about a month ago in June.  I am always finding a way to drive my car, or I am always telling my friends and family I will drive! I love getting up in morning to go to work so I can just drive  my car! I am also loving the gas mileage!"
pontiac,g5,2008,ckone, 08/31/2008,Sports car in disguise,5,"I have had my G5 preferred package in competition yellow for 4 months now and I love it. I like that there are not many on the road so people tend to do a  double take when I drive by. Lots of people wanna race (maybe because it's yellow) which I think is ridiculous with fuel prices being so high. I commute 74 miles one way to work on highways, freeways and city streets with lots of hills and I am averaging 29.5 mpg. Just as good as a scion tc but way cheaper."
pontiac,g5,2008,g5gt2008, 03/05/2009,best little car,5,i bought the G5 GT because i wanted a new car. i cant be happyer with the car i picked. this car is very powerfull for a 4cyl i have taken to the 1/4 mile and ran a 15.03 all stock with the 2.4 5 speed. i have 30k on it already and my dealer has not seen it ones. i get 40mpg on the highway and 33 in the city. the ride is very nice. the car stoped on a dime and the inside is nice and laid out right with not to many bottons. the seats are for good for long driveing. i just drove it on a 31 hour one was trip and it was great. would def but another one.
pontiac,g5,2008,Rob, 05/06/2009,One Hot G5!,5,"This was my first car. I got it brand new in 2008 as a 2008 model. Its really fun to drive, sporty looking, and quick for its powertrain. The Pontiac G5 hasnt given me any trouble, and im getting 30.3 mpg average. I baby my car, keeping it clean and not dogging it, only go above 3500 RPMS every so often to hear her hum. People always want to race because it looks so sporty...Victory Red. Love the car, would recommend it to anyone!"
pontiac,g5,2008,blink1342, 02/09/2008,Fun to drive!,5,"I bought this car about one month ago and I can say I am very happy, excellent ride, very comfortable seating, good cornering , nice style, small and fuel efficient, what else could you want, for this price?  I am very happy i have had many GM cars in the past, like the impala, century, malibu and they were all great, reliable vehicles. Overall recommended. At least test drive one and you'll see what I am talking about."
pontiac,g5,2008,Lloyd, 02/27/2008,Fun to Drive,5,Ordered this car to replace 1999 Sunfire in October and have been very satisfied with the performance of this car. This car replaced the Sunfire and Pontiac responded to all the Sunfire owners on how to improve it. The ride is much smoother and the handling with the improved suspension is great. It has a lot of the features that more expensive cars have at a lesser price. Handles well in snow!

Only ""repair"" was replacing battery after about 2 years, other than that standard maintenance.  Looking around at new cars now because its been a while and I can afford such, but i really like the G5 and wish i had a place to keep it with an additional car.  mileage and acceleration are solid.  If you are tall, space is an issue and you would not want to regularly travel in back seats but overall comfortable.

pontiac,g5,2008,James, 08/27/2008,So Cal G5,4,"I traded in my 2004 Mazda 3 for the new G5 with automatic tranny. Even the dealer asked me why I was trading the ""great"" Mazda for the Pontiac. But the Mazda was a piece of junk. Over $2k in repairs after warranty.  So far I'm happy with the little Pontiac. I like the black exterior too. I got the preferred package with the nice 16"" wheels/ABS. But my gas mileage has been poor so far. Only averaging about 24 mpg. Maybe 30 on the highway. But So Cal gas stinks too.  I would recommend the car for the reasonable price easily instead of the overpriced, underfeatured Japanese makes."
pontiac,g5,2008,BLCurry, 03/10/2010,Wish I could get rid of it!,3,"My car has had many small issues, speaker went out, air vents won't turn, blinker doesn't tick anymore. The one thing that set me over the edge is that the battery is in the trunk. That is really not a problem, until you combine that with the whole anti theft thing where when your battery is unhooked or dies, your key gets stuck in the ignition. How are you supposed to get to your dead or unhooked battery that is in your trunk with the key stuck in the ignition? Seriously? Most women (and this is a woman's car) do not keep their spare on them. So, that leaves us with either climbing into the trunk or calling a popalock to open our trunk. Oh, and now the thing is on the recall list FANTASTIC!"
pontiac,g5,2008,Disappointed, 06/09/2010,Never buy a GM again!,2,"This car is nothing but problems! I will never buy anything from GM again.  It feels like every day something else is wrong with this car and then when I bring it to the dealer for service, they tell me they have it fixed yet the problem never gets resolved until five trips back to the dealer and after buying parts I didn't even need!   I HATE this car!  Take my advise and save your money and time, I wish I did.  NEVER AGAIN!"
pontiac,g5,2008,Bigron, 11/20/2008,G5 GT - Not For Me!,3,"I bought this car this past January, but was disappointed. I really only bought it for the gas mileage (since gas prices were peaking just over $4.00 per gallon!). I'm an avid weightlifter, a big guy (6'2 260). I have a small waist (I wear a size 33 inch/34 length cargo pants) but I have very large arms and very broad shoulders. My point is, my upper body feels too cramped in a car this size, and there is not much headroom. Bigger guys definitely should not purchase this car because I guarantee you that you will not be comfortable!"

Outside rear end/trunk of car sits up high and view is also hindered by rear seat head rests and spoiler. Interior: Poor storage - has 1 shallow console ""bin"" and no center cup holders. Steering wheel tilts up & to ctr. level but not down. Seats are rock hard & have no cushion or give to them. Speedometer has this silly high arch in dashboard above it that makes it hard to see  if you're short. If you raise seat up high to better reach steering wheel, legs are then jacked up at ackward numbing angle making it hard to reach down to pedals. "

pontiac,g5,2008,DR, 06/07/2008,Great Little Car,4,Purchased this in May '08. I test drove the Chevy Cobalt and ended up liking this a lot. Gas mileage is fairly good.  (25 city/32 hwy). Price is right too. Beats buying the Japanese products!
pontiac,g5,2008,kristinamac, 06/07/2008,My Review,4,The dealership was amazing and nice but I have had a problem where every time I go to give it gas or go up on a hill it will pull and roar. It's not suppose to do that. I took it to the dealership and they said there was nothing wrong with it. I'm going to continue to take it to the dealer until the problem is fixed.

pontiac,g5,2008,Jessie, 07/13/2008,G-5 excellent,5,We have had our G5 a short while. But I have to say! The car has performed up to it's consumer ratings and some. I would highly suggest this car for anyone. A lot of fun to drive. Very sporty looking. And gets great fuel mileage. Very cool little car. Will make you feel young again. We had a 2006 Dodge Charger. Nothing but problems with it. I have always been interested in Pontiac. Until now! I can say! If you have a interest in the G5. Go for it! You will not regret it. We absolutely love our G5.
pontiac,g5,2008,Beautifultruce, 10/14/2008,Reliable.,4,"My job involves driving over an extensive area, and the mileage I get with my G5 is worth every penny that I spend on gas (30-32 mpg highway, 25-29 mpg city). The driver information system alerts are also very helpful - so far only needed for traction and tire pressure. "
pontiac,g5,2008,misty, 12/17/2008,Pontiac G5,3,"I got my Pontiac in May brand new and it ran great until it started getting cold out. Then it decided to have problems starting.We tried jumping it and nothing happened. I have had it in the shop 3 times for the same problem. 1st they asked if I pressed the clutch in far enough, 2nd they replaced the ignition, and 3rd they replaced the starter not to mention they had to put a hose on the radiator due to a recall and fix a leak in the windshield and do some work in the transmission due to grinding when going into 4th gear. So my advice, get the extended warranty, you will need it"
pontiac,g5,2008,staple_l, 01/19/2009,Second Chance,1,"So I gave Pontiac a second chance. I traded my 2005 Pontiac G6 in for a 2008 Pontaic G5. This car stinks. Been in the shop too many times for a new car. Motors replaced in windows and locks. Seat belts replaced, failed. And now with only 10,000 miles on it replacing brakes. The engine is loud for a 4 cyl. Chrome peeling off the door handles. Pontiac stinks. I gave them a second chance and I no longer will drive one. Gas mileage stinks, I'm lucky to get 24 miles to the gallon, maybe, if I drove 55 on the California freeways, I think not."
pontiac,g5,2008,Shelby, 07/30/2009,Becoming irritated with my G-5,4,"I bought my G-5 last July as sort of an impulse buy, part of the ""new me"" I wish I would have done more research on this vehicle. I also wish I would have known that Pontiac was going under and that right now i can buy my car for as cheap as $10,000! Anyways, I drive my car 90 miles round trip to school and it's never left me on the side of road. In the year i've had it though, its been to the shop twice for annoying squeeks. One is in the rear brakes (they said nothing was wrong), and the sunroof squeeks. Also, when i make a turn the car twist and pops the sunroof out of the roof. The crome on the door handles peeled off. The warranty for Pontiac is nice, but not bringing it in for repairs."
pontiac,g5,2008,WOOF, 11/02/2009,Too Many Troubles!,3,"Bought new and had for almost 2 years before finally parting ways. Decent power, styling and MPG but way too many problems. Here's the list of things it went back to the dealer for in no specific order: Power windows, power door locks, sunroof switch bezel fell off repeatedly, std tranny shifting problems repeatedly, water in headlight assy, CD/Radio replaced twice (orig, and replacement both failed), etc. etc. etc. The car did start and run every day, but I feel that the benchmark for a ""new"" car should be just a little bit higher than that. Wish I had researched before buying. My main reason for choosing it was the ""good deal"" (rebates). Sorry GM, but I'm done now. Just bought a Mazda."
pontiac,g5,2008,Skyhawk, 04/29/2008,G5 Kentucky,5,"I bought this G5 as a ""go to work"" vehicle.  Solid performer.  Drive train (engine & transmission) are very smooth and responsive.  I got 7,000 miles on it and I'm averaging about 29.5 mpg (mostly interstate driving). Road noise is minimal.  Limited visibility on the passenger side ""blind spot""."
pontiac,g5,2008,GMNeverAgain, 11/06/2020,What a [non-permissible content removed],1,"Where do I start. The lower control arms fell apart just after warranty. Fuel mileage was much worse than it should have been, about 18mpg combined. Ran rough, shifted terrible. Poor rear visibility. Avoid at all costs. Your better off walking."
pontiac,g5,2009,shark0311, 03/22/2014,Dependable Good Gas Mileage,5,"I bought the bright red Pontiac G5 GT  2 door coupe with automatic transmission new. It came with every available option, (IE: leather, sun roof, Pioneer XM stereo, heated seats, remote start, 17 inch tires). I drive a lot of highway miles to/from work and I wanted a car that got good highway gas mileage and looked sporty. Highway 32 mpg winter, 36 mpg summer. Mileage decreases at speeds over 65 mph.  Original tires lasted to 98,000. Replaced rear brakes at 120,000, front brakes at 182,000. Now replacing second set of tires 3/23/16 at 185,500 miles. I change oil every 4,000 to 5,000 miles and have most routine maintenance performed. The front right strut has failed twice (weak design).  Car is getting noisier with age (road noise).  Handling in snow is not very good for this lightweight car.  Comfort is not the best as expected with a smaller lightweight car, but for a go-to-work car, it exceeds my expectations. Not recommended for adult seating in the back as it is difficult to get in and out and head clearance isn't sufficient for over 6'-0"" individuals.  Other than this, it has been a relatively low cost maintenance car and very dependable.  Replaced serpentine belt and second set of rear brakes around 215,000 miles, replaced battery at 223,000, all for reliability reasons. Still runs good averaging 35 mpg.  Struts starting to rattle with age and will likely replace soon. Up to 237,000 miles now with only routine maintenance. 9/30/18 at 10 years old I have 245,000 miles now, averaged 35.4 MPG for the last year, replaced front struts as a new kit (rattled), transmission fluid (routine), and rear brakes (worn).  Gave the car to my adult son to drive with 250,000 miles now, so this will be my last update. Still running.  Required work on rusted brake cable at 270,000 miles.
"
pontiac,g5,2009,Sumer R., 11/29/2015,Still love this car!,5,"In 2014, I purchased this car used from a reputable dealer in my area. Truth be told, I've always owned a foreign vehicle, but I was working with a limited budget, and understood I couldn't be picky. The dealer showed me this car, and I wasn't totally impressed initially, but after a test drive, I had a change of mind. This car gets it done. I've had it for about 18 months now, and as a commuter, who drives about 30,000 miles a year, my little silver bullet has proven solid through an extreme winter in Ohio, never given me any engine trouble, and is pretty comfy for a base model. I keep the oil changed, and I do regular maintenance as the manufacturer suggests.

6/17 update: Finally something went bad on this little car. In April, I learned the transmission was in need of replacement. I had it replaced for $1992, as a point of reference for anyone looking for costs. Still running. I now have 166,000 on this car.
"
pontiac,g5,2009,Cakesa3, 12/05/2010,I love my G5!,5,"My dad purchased me this car because I was transferring to a university and I needed a reliable car and I absolutely love it! I have had no problems (other than the steering defect recall which GM is replacing). This car is very fun to drive, handles well, and gets great gas mileage. It doesn't have the greatest horsepower, but will get and go. When it was purchased it had about 23,000 miles and it now has around 26,700. Nothing has been replaced. I plan to keep this car until it won't go anymore. I would recommend this car for a teenager/college student or just anyone who loves a small reliable car! I wish Pontiac didn't go under!"
pontiac,g5,2009,imprettychill1, 12/02/2013,This car is freaking amazing.,4,"Wow, whoever wrote a bad review is totally wrong and has no idea. It made me realize that a lot of people out there will never be pleased no matter what. The Pontiac G5 is the best car I've ever owned, and my previous car was a six cylinder Lexus ES300. The G5 is small for sure, but it packs a serious punch that I never expected out of a car with a 4 cylinder engine. It's faster than my Lexus was and is way more fun to drive. In my opinion it's the best economy car on the market. Seriously, the dudes (or dudettes) who wrote bad reviews need to get their heads checked because the G5 is amazing. Just wish they were still being made. I would get a new one without any type of reservation. "
pontiac,g5,2009,timetodrive, 10/21/2011,G5 is FUN to Drive!,4,"Not only for teens, being a 60+ guy who wanted to try a stick shift again.
Bought new, there is now over 18,000 miles on my G5 - all of it put on by me.
It's a blast to drive.
I'd forgotten how much punch a manual transmission provides compared to the non-premium automatics.
The freeway on-ramps are fun again and driving in traffic is even much more interesting than driving an automatic.
I've had absolutely no problems with the car.
Mileage is over 28 mpg in town and over 35 on the highway - with regular gas and a fairly ""heavy"" foot.
The ride is fairly quiet and comfortable.
Finally, my wife loves to go out with me in our ""sports car!"""
pontiac,g5,2009,Shelly, 05/03/2016,Great car,5,"I have owned my 2009 G5 for 1 1/2 years. I have had great performance, reliability and performance. The only problem I seem to have is the fob keeps burning out. would like to find ananswer for it. I bought it because I travel on the freeway to work every day. Montana has some harsh winter weather, It has great traction in the snow. What I don't like is driving it in the rain on the highway. It seems to hydroplane easily.
"
pontiac,g5,2009,cchhr, 12/14/2008,"Good car, but too small!",4,"I just got my Pontiac G5. When I test drove it, I should have listened to my legs! I'm a 5'11 woman, and I can't wear heels when driving because of the lack of leg room. I have to push the seat all the way back. But the car is a lot of fun to drive, the gas mileage is incredible. A great buy if you're a shorter person.  The interior is a little cramped, and there isn't much room to put anything, but once you get used to it, it's not that bad."
pontiac,g5,2009,Adam Gonzalez, 03/10/2018,Great looking Medium size car Boring inside,4,"It's a great looking car outside but the same designers did not work inside. It's all gray vinyl inside. No leather, cloth or exciting colors. The driver's side is fine and the fuel, speed gadgets are sporty and go well with the outside of the car. It is fun to drive. I like the car.
"
pontiac,g5,2009,LadyRae, 10/28/2015,The worst care I have EVER owned.,1,"I cannot WAIT to get rid of this car.  It is simply the worse car I have ever owned.  I've had the ignition replaced on recall TWICE.  At less than 78,000, I've had to replace the brakes at 63,000 (I owned 3 Cavaliers and NEVER had to replace the brakes this early).  I've replaced one wheel bearing and the other needs replaced (again, never had that issue on any other vehicle I've owned).  Basically, the front end is shot.  The body is rusting through on the doors, hood, and trunk.  It is simply horrible in snow, rain and wind.  The front stereo speakers stopped working within 2 years of ownership.  The car is noisy, cramped.  I will say the engine itself is good.  Just everything attached to it is simply horrible.
"
pontiac,g5,2009,kc hillman, 01/30/2009,Nice car for the price,5,"Needed a new vehicle to use primarily to run around town that would be economical. Noticed the G5 on Pontiac web site. Sticker on vehicle we purchased was over $22500, but GM knocked off $2500 from the start, plus another $2500. off with incentives. The vehicle is a silver GT model which is well loaded (XM radio, remote start, sunroof, automatic, etc.) It rides nice, handles well on 17"" rims and is comfortable. It is small interior wise, but we knew that going in. It seems well-built and the whole family is well pleased with it. It may not have a ""pure-bred"" pedigree since it's basically a Cobalt, but it is much nicer than we'd anticipated! We are glad we gave it a look."
pontiac,g5,2009,T19, 04/05/2009,"Great commuter, lots of fun",5,"Love the yellow, Im 6ft 1, 280 lbs and this car fits great.  its fun to drive, not what I expected a commuter to be. Controls easy to use, radio good, ride good, road noise very low, build quality good.  dont like the light material on the seats and doors, should have bought darker.  just hope I can keep my lic. My Son wants this car, wants to dump his old civic.. so why do the car critics trash this car??  I would buy another one."
pontiac,g5,2009,ed, 07/10/2009,It's a commuter car...,4,I've had this car for about a month. I love the so-so reviews on this. It keeps demand low and prices. I'm very familar with the 2.2 - same engine I had in my '04 Grand Am and loved it. No problems great mileage - good power too. This time I went for MPG with the XFE and the 5 speed. Without any effort I got 35mpg on my first tank of combind city and highway. It's just a good commuter car. Not a sports car (I have the Miata for that) and not a lux car. With incentive and rebates about 5k lower in price than comparably equiped Honda and Toyota. AS far as resale - drive it. The sale of Grand Am brought half of what I paid with 75k on the clock - not bad for having the better half of its life..
pontiac,g5,2009,john, 07/26/2009,Long Range Commuter,5,"So far perfect. I have a 180 mile round trip commute,at 3 AM onstar is comforting. The car gets great mileage,very comfortable,xm radio in the lonely areas,fun to drive. For a commuter that gets 37mpg the overall performance is outstanding. Base level G5 xfe, 5 Speed about 17K, -4,500 cash for clunkers, 3,500 incentives, 500ish dealer discount +tt&l, came to 10,700 whats not to love. I got way more than I paid for.  11 bucks a month extended the bumper to bumper to 100,000 miles."
pontiac,g5,2009,IdyJ, 08/16/2009,Nice little car from Pontiac,4,"Very affordable vehicle with rebates and browny points.  A great commuter car when you consider the competition is more money for not a whole lot more car.  Could have a better interior, but I new what I was getting when I got it.  I like the engine very quite."

pontiac,g5,2009,Tim, 12/16/2008,Great choice for the price,4,I finally bought this car after reading reviews and staring at pictures of it over a course of 2 years and it's precisely the car I wanted. Coming from a 2003 basic model of a Saturn Ion it's a huge upgrade and great for someone my age (22).
pontiac,g5,2009,razer, 04/09/2009,G5 GT - Great Car,4,"Just purchased the GT 2009, it's a fun car to drive, lots of leg room in front, and if there isnt enough leg room in the back for other people, then they can take the bus, or consider themselves lucky to get a free ride.  I used to drive the Saturn 2006 Ion Red Line with 205 Hp, the GT only has 155 Hp, there is a difference in power but I noticed a bigger difference in gas prices when I fell up at the pumps. In the standard 5 speed model, in 5th gear, the engine rev's very low which helps in reduced engine noise. For the appearance inside, I like it, everything is in front of you, seats are firm, armrest with storage.   "
pontiac,g5,2009,Indiana G5 Owner, 07/28/2009,New G5 - Great car !,4,"Just purchased new 2009 G5 with automatic transmission, which was priced $4k lower than similar equiped 2009 Honda Civic. Consumer Reports rated the G5 reliability equal to the Honda Civic except for ""body integrity and/or finish"" and has a better reliability rating than most American built cars. Also has a better factory warranty than Honda or Toyota. Although time will tell if this G5 will be as reliable as my other car; i.e. Honda. So far, enjoying the creature comforts, sound system and the ""GREAT"" gas mileage - 39+ mpg! I'm happy the car received so-so ratings, keeps the price down and affortable in these tough times."
pontiac,g5,2009,Mean Marcus, 08/29/2009,Bought a bargain,3,"I would not have bought this tiny car, except for the $4,500 federal rebate.  The gas mileage is incredible.  The speed sensitive electrical power steering is just ok.  Cornering is ok.  I think it should have better front brakes, given the weight ratio.   Attn. Gm:  this is a coupe.  Do you understand?  am I getting through?  it's a coupe; a coupe.  Make it comfortable for two people.  Jump seats would be fine in back.  And the parking brake nestled under the armrest is just plain stupid."
pontiac,g5,2009,g5driverMI, 09/25/2009,Fantastic Car,4,"For a 19yo 6ft 210lb person i found the car very comfortable. I love the styling and it looks fantastic when cared for. I did find the e-brake under the armrest odd, however not really a problem. I drive very aggressively and still get great gas mileage. Coming from my previous vehicle (2003 Aztek) it is extremely fun to drive. It preforms pretty well, however dogs slightly until you get to 40+ mph. This can be alleviated with affordable after-market parts such as performance exhaust and intake."
pontiac,g5,2009,mccannamn59, 05/25/2011,I love my car,4,"The pontiac g5 is the perfect car for a teenager whos trying to save some money on gas, and still drive a nice car."

Seats very uncomfortable. Gas mileage not that good for a small 4 cyl.  Mine did not even come with a spare tire or jack. It is not only plastic, but cheap plastic. And I am sure resale will be horrible.  Do not learn the hard way like I have. I LOVE AMERICA, but not their small cars."

I am 6'4 250 LBS and I find it has more room than most other cars i have driven. The seat has the ability to move back far enough for even me. I was surprised that the actual fuel milage was up near 30 mpg even with someone like me (19 years old) driving it. I love the Intermediate feature even though I really wanted the 5 speed, it is nice to just shift down to that to slow down, very good feature that I have never seen before. The biggest downfall for me, the AC Outlet is placed under the armrest which annoys me. "
pontiac,g5,2009,In Colorado, 09/29/2009,Not worth MSRP,3,"I bought this car with a combination of rebates (regular & 'owner loyalty') plus GM doubled my GM Card fun bucks.  Bottom line: I got a car with an 19K MSRP for 12K before taxes.  I find the interior to be functional an it looks ok.  The exterior is plagued with poor fitting body panels, poor even by American standards.  Acceleration is adequate with the 5 speed manual. Handling is ok, much better than the 2002 Toyota Corolla it replaced.  Rear visbility is abysmal and I almost didn't buy it because of that, but the bottom line was that it was very well equipped for what I paid. Its a commuter car that will eventually be handed down to the kid."

Serviced at Steinle GM in Fremont, OH but they can't fix it either because they dont care or dont know how.  It has run down protection so the battery should never go dead.  They just say ""there's nothing we can do""."
pontiac,g5,2009,thebarkingspider, 12/09/2009,Last of the Pontiacs: G5,4,"This car has been 100% reliable and, for a small economy car, it's fun to drive.  Had the dealer correct a minor manufacturing defect with the antenna, and otherwise it's been perfect.  Steering is solid and precise.  Acceleration is good, but won't blow your sox off.  Visibility is fair -- the faux spoiler partially blocks the view aft, and side mirrors are a bit small.  At 6'5"", I can't rave about space, but it is adequate, and better than most cars of this size (and many larger cars as well).  Plenty of storage, with folding rear seats to expand trunk space.  Noise level very good as small cars go."
pontiac,g5,2009,First GM Buyer, 12/21/2009,First GM Buyer,4,"I bought this car in July with warranty for 5 years or 40,000 miles. The drive is very comfortable however there is a noise problem with the steering wheel (it rattles every time you take a turn). At this moment car is mostly sitting in the garage. The dealer has already replaced the steering column but the noise is still there. GM refuses do anything more, but I am still fighting to get it fixed. I like every other feature though. Dont expect more in this price range, at least $4000 less than comparing Japanese models and the G5 has better features, look, fuel efficiency. I am not sure why GM took this brand off the market."
pontiac,g5,2009,tommyboy181, 01/14/2010,Okay but not special,3,Exterior styling is nice one the G5 but actual gas mileage is lower than I expected. Fit and finish is typical of a domestic lots of hard plastics. Not bad but not appealing either

After replacing the rack and pinion, it still had the noise, it went back again and this time the inter. shaft and steering column was replaced, it no longer makes the noise (for now), but I have found 2 items not put back together correctly. I am not happy with the car, or the dealership I have it serviced at. The car handles bad and has since I got it, even with new tires it just doesn't handle well, I can see why the company went under!"

It had just had its 100k tune up with new plugs wires fluids etc... It's been a great car I cannot complain at all. The car has fantastic power and the drive train Is very reliable so far. The interior is very nicely put together unlike some of its predecessors at at gm. After almost 200 k I have no tears in the seats, cracks in the dash, no paint coming off of switches or any of the sorts. The interior is one of the best interiors in my opinion. The dash is clean and straight forward, not busy like most newer cars which is not my style. Red led gauges illuminate cleanly unlike previous red interiors from gm. On the outside  the quality seems to be just as good l. Paint still looks great and shines like new after 12 years.  Suspension has been fair. It does handle very nice and is a comfortable car but it's had its problems which I will go into detail soon. Now for the problems. At 10k It developed a leak in the Heater core that was VERY expensive. 1200 to replace only to have the new one do the same (independent garage used au to zone parts i fear)..... the third Heater core has been good to me so far. At 160 k I had to replace the fuel pump as it had developed a crack in the line molded to the top of it. Pump still worked fine but required replacing the whole unit because of the tube. At 180 k I  had to replace tie rod ends and left lower control arm but I believe this had to do with terrible oklahoma roads,  not poor design. The steering column has a rattle when you hit a bump the I could never fix. Also the headlamps and connectors required rwplacing as thwy had corroded in the connector and shorted out. Last of all it has developed a small oil leak I noticed when changing the oil and I have yet to access and fix this problem. This has been the problems I have gotten so far. For a car I paid 8000 for I have probably put 2000 in repairs and have had almost 6 years I would call this a great buy. I love the car. I hope I get as lucky as the guy below me and make it to 338 k. I know for a car that is fantastic mileage.. update Sept 2018... I hit a deer doing 70 last november....  pulled the hood  back straight, replaced the headlights and kept on rolling. I had just switched to liability. Since I last updated I had to replace the front wheel bearings and it will need a brake caliper soon.. 227 k miles so far

I changed spark plugs at 180k miles, and they weren't even bad, but just thought it was enough miles on them. One complaint is the suspension, for the last 200k miles, it makes lots of rattles in the suspension. I'm sure it's an easy fix, but it still works good. We did replace power steering around 250k miles. Other than that, we have had amazing reliability with this car. Just do regular maintenance, wash the car once in a while, and you'll have no problems. This is a MN car, and there's lots of salt on our roads in the winter, and the body is just about perfect still. Would buy again."

Oh yeah, power steering is ineffective for first few mins of driving after a cold start on winter morning. I don't let my kids in this car. We take the family SUV, due the G6 brake problems. And I thought motorcycles were dangerous!"
pontiac,g6,2005,Carrie Fitzgerald, 01/19/2006,G6 Rating-Poor,3,"I purchased a new G6 in early 2005. It is very sporty  looking and I get lots of comments on the appearance. Appearance aside, I have had nothing but problems out of the car. It was in the shop within the first two weeks having a new amp installed because the original quit working. The drivers side sunvisor broke, the cupholder in the backseat broke, the automatic lock on the passengers door did not work and had to be fixed, a clicking sound on the drivers door was fixed, a new starter was installed, and the sunroof had to be fixed because of a constant rattle. Purchasing this car has definitely made me decide to never purchase another Pontiac again. "
pontiac,g6,2005,Beth, 01/27/2009,Do not buy this car,2,"I bought a used G6 GT last March and have had nothing but problems with car.  First the paint started to chip off the car.  Then the break lights started to work opposite (not consistently) which made it almost impossible to have fix. I ended up buying a new BCM (600.00 computer) at 34K.  After this, my CD changer broke and I had that replaced. I also replaced the brake pads and both outer tierods and tires (which wore out because of the tierods). Now the power shifts when the car is driving.  The lights on the dash will surge to the radio and the rest of the vehicle.  The radio will also shift from one side to the other. All in 10 months.  "
pontiac,g6,2005,patroness, 04/02/2013,Had this for 3 years no real issues,4,"My G6 2005 has 120,000 miles on it. Up til now I have only had to replace the tire, brakes, and battery.
All of these things are due to be changed at its age.
Tomorrow I am replacing a tie rod and a Control arm, both considered to be a wearable item. Given its mileage I think that there replacement is a no issue.
I have no complaints other than the featureless radio and built in Info center. At 120, 000 miles my car still drives, looks, feels like new. I have a future plan to change out the stereo and say good by to the info display. 
I have in the past changed the transmission fluid, and I will do a spark plug and belt change all thing due at 100,000."
pontiac,g6,2005,Lauren, 09/13/2006,Love it!,5,"I owned a convertible Beetle before the G6 and I am so glad I made the trade! I bought a silver 2005 GT sedan with 16k miles. Although I miss the convertible, I love my G6. I consistently get 25 mpg city and 34+ highway; I got around 18 city in a 4 cyl Beetle. Very spacious and comfy. Handles great and it's very fun to drive. Doesn't feel like a sedan at all. The Beetle felt like a $25k go- kart compared to the G6."
pontiac,g6,2005,unsatisfied, 09/25/2008,unsatisfied,3,"Since i bought my car in Dec. 2007 it has been in the shop multiple times for almost every reason possible. I Do NOT believe that Pontiac took time to make sure the quality was up to par before putting it on the market. My seat has broken so when i drive i sit sideways, my fuel pump has gone out, had to get new smart start software, you name it I've had it replaced or fixed!"
pontiac,g6,2005,Disappointed buyer, 02/07/2009,"great looking car, not so great quality",2,"Purchased my Pontiact G6 new. Loved the look but disappointed in workmanship. Was back at dealer during the 3 year warrenty period many times. 4 Paneled sunroof took several trips to dealer to fix major rattle. Kept the car a week.  3 years later roof rattles again.  Check engine light comes on about every 6 months. Changed sensors several times.Plastic parts on doors, windows constently rattle. Stereo speakers needed replacement. Biggest problem is with steering on cold days. Recall work done has not solved it. Love the car but Pontiac needs to get their act together and stand behind their workmanship! I might have to buy Japanese cars next time if they don't get their act together!"
pontiac,g6,2005,brian231, 08/15/2013,2005 G6 Gt 3.5,4,"This was the first new car I ever own. I had all the bells and whistles. I drove this car mainly on interstate twice a month to and from work 120 miles each way. In 8 years I put 63,000 on the car 90% interstate. Feul milage averaged 31mpg. It had plenty of power pulling mountains. Car was not good in snow if roads wheren't plowed good. Only issue where tires. Went threw multiple sets on rear until I found a good rubber combination. Had issues one time with sunroof leak that dealer fixed without issue. Only replaced brakes once at 50,000. Very good power to pull into traffic at interstate speed. Had radio info center repalced under warranty once."
pontiac,g6,2005,Glenn Weisel, 04/13/2009,Dissapointed in Pennsylvania,3,"After buying All GM vehicles for my driving career of 36 years, I am very disappointed with my G6  GT . The styling and gas mileage are great but the build quality is awful. Currently with 59000 miles I have moisture inside the headlights , A broken drivers seat, deteriorating leather , broken hood release handle , and a bicycle caused 1100.00 damage to the left front fender which now rubs  on the drivers door when opening. This is a very cheaply built car.   Pontiac owes us G6 owners an additional credit toward a next car.  I have never seen such horrible workmanship on a GM product."
pontiac,g6,2005,Kristina, 12/28/2009,Will never buy Pontiac again!!!!,2,"When I first saw this car, I had to have it. It was sporty, roomy, and a good affordable price. Well, you get what you pay for!!! I have had to bring it in the shop several times....a ball joint and power steering column replacement, random lights bulbs go out all the time, keyless entry failed all of a sudden, belt replacement, shock replacement. I mean come on!!! The car isn't even that old. Might I add that I purchased the model with the panoramic sunroof...what a piece of crap. The noisiest ride ever. It is so loud I can barely stand it. I think it was cheaply made...looks good from the exterior, but runs like a cheap go-cart!! Thank god i bought an extended warranty"
pontiac,g6,2005,Jones, 02/15/2010,Great Car...At First.,3,"We bought the car with only 20k miles on it and when we bought it we did not like the idea of buying another Pontiac because of our previous 1996 Pontiac Grand Am. Basically the Grand Am was just renamed and remodeled into a G6 and still had the same reliablity issues.. So far, we have had the usual Pontiac tranmission replacment, steering column replaced and still having popping issues, cd player broken, keyless entry stopped working (even after replacing battery inside the remote), power steering failing while driving, constant brake issue and rotor warping. This car is fun to drive its not all bad, but Pontiac just covered their issues with a new body style. no improvement."
pontiac,g6,2005,Robin, 03/09/2010,Very Shaky,2,I bought my car used and had a 60 day warranty with it.  When I first bought it the power steering was a little rough so they fixed that.  Then I had to take it in 3 times after that because it would shake real bad on the highway.  On the third time they told me my tires were wearing unevenly.  I bought new ones. I've had to replace them and later had to replace them again.  Now I'm on my second year and it still is shaking real bad.  It is to the point I am scared of driving it.  It makes a loud clunking noise in the front when I'm going around 55. I can't wait until I can afford to get rid of it.  I used to love Pontiac but I'm kinda glad they don't make them anymore.  I'm disappointed.
pontiac,g6,2005,rick, 03/22/2010,Not happy,4,"This car was great in the beginning, well maintained, but consistent front suspension rattling (repaired, but still exists) had to replace intake manifold, catalytic converter and now instrument panel cluster that controls gas gauge, tach etc. I called gm and the ""violin"" was playing. I work for gm (25 yrs.) and they do build quality products, but they forgot the most important word. ""reliability."" Just go to technical services bulletins and you will find all the problems. I've had too many problems that shouldn't be. Come on gm, listen to us or you'll lose me and others to you know who!"
pontiac,g6,2005,katiek239, 05/17/2012,Love my baby!,4,"I bought my G6 in March and have put 3k on it so far. I bought it with 94k, and only had one owner who replaced pretty much everything that goes out at that high of mileage. I've had zero problems since I've bought it except my windshield cracked and I had to replace it. It's got all the features, 3.6L V6 engine, monsoon stereo, 6 CD changer, fog lights, power pedals, chrome wheels, etc. Definitely a head turner. It's a very sporty fun car for a daily commute. It's my first nice car I've ever owned and I'd definitely recommend for someone who is looking for a nice, cheap, sporty car. "
pontiac,g6,2005,Bob, 11/08/2006,Best car I've ever owned!,5,"I bought a silver '05 G6 STD sedan 18 months ago and haven't had a problem with it yet. The fuel economy is great, even though I only have the 4- speed automatic. The car drives and handles great-both in the city here in Washington, DC and on the highway on my way out to the beach or to Pittsburgh. When I first bought it, I couldn't stop staring at it. I still get compliments on the car's styling. If you're looking for something that looks great, is practical and economical, you've got to test drive this car. One note: I should have gotten the XM radio option. I had to retrofit an aftermarket unit, which doesn't look as clean as if I would have just gotten the optional radio."
pontiac,g6,2005,wflo, 08/24/2007,my g-6,1,"I will not buy another G-6 Pontiac, because of all the problems I have had with it! The body style allows the sand from the road to sand blast the lower parts of the car, especially the flare on the rear quarters! Had it painted at 17,000, and now at 35000, it is the same as it was! Have had the brakes worked on 3 times, and again another problem with them! Have contacted GM, and they just as much said sorry about that, we will not buy it back!They need a new design, or some type of lowers body protection! Plus a larger brake disc and pads!"
pontiac,g6,2005,Caitlin, 08/06/2016,Don't buy car,3,"I bought the car in Jan of 16, so this year and since then I have had to put in 2300$ into the car, it was sitting 178000 miles on it... I got it with a brand new alternator- then the recall for the ignition came along, so of course I had to replace that after a month of owning the car. Then put new struts shocks sway bar links. My head gasket blew when it to 190,000 and today exactly 8 months later from the day I bought the car, my transmission crapped out on me... I regret buying this car. Don't buy it

pontiac,g6,2005,charlesp2009, 03/14/2012,"The first 5 years were great, now it's falling apart!",3,"I have had my 2005 Pontiac G6 GT for more than 5 years now and while I loved the car at first, the last year has been less than ideal.

Once the odometer passed 80,000 miles, several expensive repairs popped up, and the future doesn't look bright.
Searching the web reveals that I am far from alone with these problems; and GM's recent history from the bailout to Pontiac's untimely demise makes it all the more frustrating.

While it's a nice looking car, and fairly fun to drive, the reliability seems like it will be a serious issue as the car ages, and there are safer, better performing, and more reliable options from the Germans and Japanese..."

My car has 70K miles on it, and I've had more problems with this car than ANY car I've ever owned. Essentially, everything under the hood has had to be replaced. Today they told me that my transmission is OUT, and I dont push or pull ANYTHING! Electronic steering is out, electrical problems GALORE, brakes are crap and constantly have to be replaced. (keep in mind, all of my miles are HIGHWAY miles ONLY!) I dont speed, dont drive crazy. I can say it's definitly pretty to look at and thats it. Even my seats are squeaky, so is the dash. Its horrible. Dont buy this car. "

Aesthetically, it is a dream, really cute, but if you need more that cute, this is not the car.  Power steering intermittently locks up,transmissions has delayed response,  horrible handling, noisy sun roof.  Learned today the car has a bum cooling system that leaks.  I have been at the dealership so much I should be getting benefits or something. Save yourself time, trouble, money and lost time from work. . .DO NOT BUY A PONTIAC G6.  I swear I bought a prototype or maybe Pontiac should still be considered a neophyte car manufacturer"
pontiac,g6,2005,Lala, 01/16/2009,Horrible,2,"I bought my G6 and at first loved it, until it snowed. These are the worst cars to drive in the snow ever! Battery went dead and now the cd player is broke. I will have to buy a new cd player for $350. I hate everything about this car, cloth seats are horrible and very uncomfortable."
pontiac,g6,2005,Chris, 02/28/2005,I love it,4,"Awesome Car.  Just purchased the G6 GT and can't stop driving it.  I was not a fan of GM vehicles after having worked for them for three years, but was really impressed with the design and specs.  Test drove the vehicle and loved it, had to purchase it.  The vehicle is very roomy, easy to drive, sleek, sexy and the panoramic roof is awesome.  My son loves the vehicle and asks to ride in it all the time.  Refuses to even get into our other vehicle an Altima.  The G6 also handles very well in slippery conditions, had to swerve in the rain because of an animal in the road on a very rainy day, the vehicle handled well and the traction control stopped skidding.  Love it"
pontiac,g6,2005,Cafasco, 04/20/2006,2005 V6 G6,4,"Last week, I traded in my '05 Acura RSX for a '05 v6 G6 std. sedan.  It only had 2,842 miles on it.  In comparing the two, I really like the G6 a whole lot better. Interior fit and finish is actually better than the Acura (I was surprised by squeaks and rattles in the RSX).  Exterior F & F is close, but not quite there.  I'm getting 31MPG in mixed suburban driving and 34MPG @85mph on the highway.  My RSX got 33/36mpg. I have a hell of a lot more room and an AT. G6 Radio reception BLOWS away the Acura as does the sound quality (both have six speaker systems). The G6 handles well, but not as tight as the RSX, which was actually work to drive.  G6 steering is a touch vague against the RSX."

The car has, at times, been quite fun to drive but at others it has been completely maddening.  I've already replaced the rack & pinion once, the 6 cd changer once, and the brakes have been problematic from the start, from squeals to shudders.  Electrical issues are popping up now, and I just hit 27k on my car.  This car drives and handles like a dump truck.  Replacing the stock tires with helped, but not completely.  Car has been to the dealer several times but nobody wants to find out what is causing the suspension/brake issues.  Won't buy GM for a while, and I've been a fan all my life. "

pontiac,g6,2005,Kurt, 11/16/2008,Good Daily Commuter,4,"I traded in the SUV and bought this car for a high mileage commute. I could not fit comfortably in the sub compact models available at the time and ended up purchasing a used G6. I have put 70,000 miles on my G6 since July of 07. I bought the vehicle with the driver package (XM, 6 way seat, fog lights, power pedals). I drive mainly open interstate and get about 29 MPG average which I think is pretty good based on the size and power of the vehicle. I have had the car in the shop for warranty fixes on the XM radio and the electric power steering (69 k almost missed factory warranty extension for this known problem). I currently have 96k miles on the vehicle and have had no other problems."
pontiac,g6,2005,drc60, 05/17/2009,Very Disappointed,2,"Purchased our G6 in Dec. 2005 and had the brakes repaired twice under warranty.  Now the front calipers are grabbing and causing rotors to overheat.  Have a huge vibration problem on the exhaust when accelerating.  Had the brake light come on and added brake fluid only to be told by mechanic I shouldn't have done that as it throws off the electronic sensor and they had to flush the hydraulic system out and put in measured amount of fluid to make sure it is accurate.  For only 45,000 miles we have put a lot of money into service on this car.  We are very disappointed with GM and will probably think twice about purchasing another GM product.  They need to get their act together on quality."
pontiac,g6,2005,G.Timm, 05/25/2009,Junk it,2,"Like most of the reviews, my G6 was bought new.  It rattles, shakes so bad that I am afraid to drive it.  Sun roof leaks and rattles.  The interior design is very cheap.  I also bought a new Grand Prix two months later, big difference.  My lease expires next month and I am sure I will get boned my GMAC with them having to fix all of the broken crap that should have never failed in the first place. What a cheap piece of junk."

I love driving the G6, it's a lot of fun and handles great.  Great acceleration, turning radius, handling.  The interior has way more room than it looks!  We've had several guys over 6' tall ride in the backseat with plenty of room to spare.  Had it almost 5 years and reliability's been great.  Even with several cross-country trips, it still drives great."
pontiac,g6,2005,anesbit, 07/02/2009,Feeling it out,3,"I got my 2005 g6 last night. Even in this short amount of time I have noticed several things. I am no stranger to gm I had an Aztek before this car and the Aztek was a GREAT car. As far as this g6 goes I'll have to agree with many of you on several things. First being the rattle..When you go over a speed bump it sounds like my tires are going to spin off. It creaks and moans like an old house when driving. Yes, the sunroof is awesome but i just hope it won't leak and that was one of my firsts questions , I was advised that I had nothing to worry about when in fact I'm still almost certain I'll have water inside my car."
pontiac,g6,2005,S.Ronson, 07/29/2009,Starter Car,3,"I've driven my G6 for 9 months now, and it's good and bad. It has some power, but the mileage isn't as good as the competition. The interior is poorly made, most of the buttons do not display their purposes anymore. Electrical issues for practically the whole time I've owned it."
pontiac,g6,2005,Disappointed, 08/06/2009,Should have bought a CarFax,3,"I bought my Pontiac G6 almost 2 years ago & absolutely loved it. My husband is 6'9"" & could fit in it nicely, loved the sporty feel of it but you can't drive fast with the windows down because of the loud humming noise. About 6 months after, we began our many trips to the dealership for new struts, squeaky driver seat and now lower control arm and ball joint on both sides & swaybar. I'm very thankful I bought an extended warranty. I have always owned GM vehicles but with the problems I've had with this car and the trouble I've had with more than one GM dealership, I will NEVER buy GM again and my grandfather and mother-in-law both retired from GM.

pontiac,g6,2005,Waleska H, 11/02/2009,2005 Pontiac G6 4 Dr,4,"I purchased this car in 2005 new.  Now it has 107,230 miles.  It has been a great car.  Mine has the 4 panel sunroof, which I love.  The 6 CD in- dash 300 Watt stereo is really nice.  Mine is metallic silver, which shines like a new dime in the sunlight.  The performance is great!  200 HP with plenty of torque.  The gas mileage is 36-38 at 60 MPH.  To and from work in traffic I receive 24-26 MPG.  The car is the perfect size and has plenty of room for everything.  I need to get the 100,000 mile tune-up, but it runs fine.  I have only had to replace the tires and oil.  I am sick that Pontiac is going to quit making this car."
pontiac,g6,2005,rnu, 11/05/2009,I will miss this car.,5,"I can't believe all the bad reviews of the G6 GT. I bought my car with 11k miles and am selling it with 61k. I have had no major problems whatsoever. I have loved this car. I am only getting rid of it because I need something bigger to haul twin babies. The G6 has been reliable, consistent, fun, and a car I have been proud to own. The gas mileage is incredible. I averaged well over 30 mpg on the highway. I only wish I could convince my husband to sell his truck so I could keep my car."
pontiac,g6,2005,MissLaura, 03/21/2010,Nothing but PROBLEMS,3,"I bought this car in November of 2008. One month later it was in the shop for a leak in the sunroof. I opened my car door only to find the floorboards in the front SOAKED with about an inch of water. Took the dealership two times and about two weeks with leaving my car there to find out it was the sunroof leaking. Also the lights on the dash and cd player flashed on and off and the cd player would stop working about every other week.  About two months after I bought it, I started it one day and my wheel was completely locked up. I had to re start my car in order for it to be okay again but no check engine light came on. Now a year later I am having power steering and vibrating issues"

There are certain things that annoy me though. Occasionally if I insert the key and start the car right away it stalls. I call the dealership and they said that was ""normal."" As a result of that I have adapted to turning the key to ACC and letting the car ""prepare"" for a few seconds and then starting the car. Also the Cd changer reads ""Cd changer error"" at random times. If you need new brakes get them fast. Otherwise it feels as though the car can't support it's own weight! Other than that I have greatly enjoyed this car. I have taken many successful road trips and always get looks...."
pontiac,g6,2005,Sam, 05/27/2010,New Car,4,"We bought this car brand new with 12 miles on it, then we had to take it to the dealership twice with a problem of power steering going out, when we told them the doors leaked, they told us they could not help that, it was a problem that would take time due to not having parts. Within the next couple of weeks she got a letter in the mail that said an ignition starter had to be replaced.  The car is still a pain in the butt, when it's raining the top lights leak the doors leak into the floor board, and currently I'm in the market for a new car because, i went to the dealership for the same power steering problem, and now the ABS box is fried. Do not purchase one. Worst decision we made!"
pontiac,g6,2005,sms1, 06/15/2010,2005 G6 GT,4,"This was the first brand new car I've ever purchased and overall I've had nothing but headaches with it.  The first thing to go was the stereo wiring within the first year, which was fixed under warranty.  Then at 62,000 miles the timing chain in my engine broke. Thankfully a call placed to the GM customer center got my engine replaced for free even though the original  warranty had expired.  Last year I received a safety recall on it for brake light & cruise control issues, had that fixed and now a year later, I'm experiencing the same issues again with the brake lights.  The only reason I've kept it this long is that the engine now is pretty new and it's almost paid for."

The styling is beautiful, both inside and out! My only minor complaints about the interior are that the leather is fading a bit on the left-side edge of the driver's seat (I must sit extra hard on that side) and some of coloring on the radio dials is starting to fade just a tad. Mechanically speaking, it's been a great car! Lately, I've had an odd sound when braking, got it fixed before brake pads were adjusted or something, but now the noise has returned. But it's apparently no cause for concern. Despite these minor flaws, though, it's been a great car and is very fun to drive!"
pontiac,g6,2005,tco_1994, 08/29/2010,Great First Car!,4,"Bought mine in June 2010 for my first car, it had 81,600 miles on it, I've had it two months and it's been great! and I don't drive it easy, its ramped a ditch and hit a field and nothing broke at all! my only complaint is the sunroof randomly opens as it pleases, and sometimes when it start it keep turning over instead of catching, but no big deal! I'm 6'2"" and i have the seat only 1/2 way back and it adjust so that my head doesn't hit the ceiling. I always get compliments on the exterior of it, and that's always nice too:)"
pontiac,g6,2005,bob, 12/04/2010,Never buying american made again.,2,"I purchased one and all I have to say I will never buy a GM vehicle ever again. Im always on top of any maintenance and im not a crazy driver, this car has been a money pit, something breaks on it every 5000 miles, im on my third engine, and have had nothing but problems with the rest of the drive train. For the amount ive put in, to keep it going I could have bought a new car. next car will be a honda after seeing what American made can do. now I see why GM has had such low sales over the years."
pontiac,g6,2005,william, 12/21/2004,Thumbs up for the G6,5,"All in all the G6 GT is Americas best mid level sports sedan, crisp handling and quick acceleration, very modern dash lay out, very roomy, excellant fuel economy, the manumatic shifter is lots of fun, the sound system is awesome, deep bass and rich highs, I am very pleased with this car, look at same type of import sedans, they pale in comparison to what you get with the G6, the Pontiac G6 is the best thing GM has put out since the Corvette in my opinion"
pontiac,g6,2005,Sambuda, 01/07/2005,Sweet Ride,5,"Since I moved to the Tri-State area, i needed to get rid of my gas hog truck.  The new G6 caught my eye, so I took it for a test drive and was blown away.  The european design, with the audi style design for the interior, this is one sweet ride. Once in, you are molded into the comfortable leather lumbar seats(heated is a plus). With 200 horses and a auto shift stick that you can red-line, this car has some bite. The tight suspension and the nice rubber is a nice touch when going around those bends at excess speeds. Way to go Pontiac, you have just re-invented the American Sport Seden.  We just gotta wait now for all the after market parts, to really ignite this car!"
pontiac,g6,2005,prm342, 01/07/2005,"Over 2,000 miles and still happy",4,"No problems so far.  Got the GT primarily for the wheels and nicer cloth.  My '97 GrandAm had been a great car since new.  The 6-way seat with leather doesn't give you much more angle/height adjustability than the 2- way with cloth.  I'd like a steeper seat angle adjustment and lower tiltability for the steering wheel, but probably both are by design to prevent the driver being launched OVER the airbag!  Thankfully, much less interior chrome (taupe interior) than most supposedly nicer cars.  To each their own, but I like its looks inside and out better than GTO or Grand Prix.        "
pontiac,g6,2005,Lorie, 01/07/2005,ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!,5,"My husband and I started looking at this car before it was available. We finally got to purchase it in Nov. Dealerships in our area didn't receive until then. I will tell you this! IT WAS WELL WORTH THE WAIT!!! We have almost 4000 miles on it already and I still want to just go everywhere and anywhere, just to drive it."
pontiac,g6,2005,mustangmarcie, 01/06/2005,This Car Rocks!,4,"We got rid of an '02 Audi A4Turbo to buy this car and are so glad we did! What a fun car to drive!! Also, a great price considering all of the features that came with the car. It's a smooth ride that's much quieter than the Audi. Glad to be back with GM!"
pontiac,g6,2005,mel rosenberg, 01/08/2005,surprise surprise,5,i have this car a month now and wow am i surprised :)  i owned a grand am and this car is no grand am.mine is fully loaded and has the pan roof-everyone thinks its awesome.so far everything works perfect and im happy.
pontiac,g6,2005,Tom Garvie, 01/12/2005,Pontiac G6-GT - great car,4,"This is a great automobile, considering I only purchased it over a week ago. I previously owned 3 Pontiac Grand-Am's before I purchased this vehicle. The engineering, design, comfort and handling are many steps above the Grand Am, which this automobile replaced. I wouldn't think twice about purchasing this automobile again. "
pontiac,g6,2005,jp, 02/03/2005,Super Hot,5,"This is the most fun in a car I have ever owned. Great looks and awesome performance. I've had mustangs, toyotas, and big trucks.  The handling is wonderful. At 110 it felt like 60 and still had room to go. I got the GT with all the extras.  Stepping into this automobile is like stepping into a make believe world.  I love to drive it. It stops on a dime when needed, corners well and accelerates quickly. I would pay the 25K for this car again in a heartbeat."
pontiac,g6,2005,Bob, 02/15/2005,Surprising,5,"One of the reasons we bought this car is because of the massive discounts GM offered.  I don't understand the current trimlines, really (mine is officially called the ""6-cylinder""?  okay...) but I think this will all make more sense in 2006 once more models and trims appear.  Anyway, this car is pretty amazing.  We didn't get ABS, and I'm regretting it now, even though the standard tires handle quite well in snow and ice.  The dealer had 10 G6s, but none of the base models had ABS or remote start, which was unfortunate.  The electric-assist steering is a bit strange at low speeds, sometimes making the wheel light as a feather in the middle of a turn.  Otherwise, I have no complaints!"
pontiac,g6,2005,morris44, 02/17/2005,Nothing like it before!,5,"I had owned a Grand Am previously, and thought the new G6 would have a comparable feel to it, but it seems that Pontiac has redone it completely!  It's a great car!"
pontiac,g6,2005,RBDELI, 02/17/2005,The G6 is an under-rated GEM.,4,"I went to the car dealership with every intention of leasing a new honda accord. I test drove a fully equipped 2005 EX-4-Cyl Accord. THe car was flawless as I expected, but nothing special and certainly not alot of fun to drive. The high payments blew me away and I told the dealer that just for kicks I wanted to look at a G6. Same dealership sold Pontiac.  The moment I drove off in the G6 I wanted it. It's V6 engine blew the doors off the 4-Cyl accord and for $3K less!. It was more fun to drive in every way and infinitely better looking. I test drove the GT model, but opted for the base model which runs circles around the similarly priced Accord. I saved $100 a month and got a better car!"
pontiac,g6,2005,Raynald R. Labonte, 02/17/2005,What's not to love.,4,"This is the most fun car to drive I have had in a long time, and we lease two new cars every 2-1/2 to 3yrs. I traded in a 2004 Grand Prix GTP (it was totaled in a wreck) with the super charger, and this G6 is just as fast exept for the high speed passing. Everyone that see's it say they love it, young and old. I am 62 and I love it. I have seen pitcher's of the hard- top converable they are going to make, and when my lease is up on this one I entend to lease a loaded one of them. Everone that see's it just love's it. Everyone that see's the sunroof open ask's to see how it look's in the different posisions. "
pontiac,g6,2005,jennifer shipley, 02/25/2005,G6 power,5,"The pontiac g6 is an awesome car to own.  It gets great fuel mileage for the power it has.  Excellent family car with all the room it has,  yet has a very sporty look."
pontiac,g6,2005,RBH, 03/02/2005,I love it,5,"I did a lot of research before i bought this car. I acutally gave up a cadillac dhs for this car and am glad i did. This is a great looking car and is pure fun to drive. The stereo is better than what i had in the  cadillac but i love the panoramic sunroof the best. The sunroof moves quickly and easily. Acceleration is great and the trunk room is unbelievable. I just took my first trip in my new g6 and got 30.2 Mpg. Back to the stereo-it is loud and crisp and beats the bose i had. Someone put a lot of thought into designing this car. Fun, fun, fun, is what this car is.  "
pontiac,g6,2005,kisseshoney8, 03/01/2005,Wonderful!,5,"I have been test driving every SUV, Sedan, and coupe out on the market. Honda, Toyota, Saturn, Mit, MB, BMW, Lexus, Acura were some that I have driven. After test driving those and not getting what I want in the vehicle or finding the color I want, I decided to test drive the G6. After just sitting in it I feel in love. Best car for the money and loads of standard features. It looks like a MB at night which is awesome. I am so glad I bought this car.  It was the best decision ever. Thanks GM for making a great car. BTW go with the silver with black interior. "
pontiac,g6,2005,Chitown Driver, 03/25/2005,My G6,5,"This car is exactly what I was looking for after Oldsmobile went out of existence. I also looked at the Nissan Altima, but there was no comparison. The G6 had it beat by miles in style, comfort, and features."
pontiac,g6,2005,E, 03/25/2005,Love it,5,"I had 3 grand ams in the past and this car is a huge improvement.  It has more power better handling and is just fun to drive.  Plus, you don't have to get the top of the line stereo to get a great sound system."
pontiac,g6,2005,g6chick, 03/25/2005,G6,4,"This car handles and rides very smoothly. It is also very quite. It has some power to it, I am very pleased with mine."
pontiac,g6,2005,MF, 03/29/2005,Competent and looks good.,4,"This car flat out looks good, and more importantly looks better than most of the competition, save the Altima. The V6 has good enough power for most use outside of drag racing, and the interior looks a lot better in person than it does in pictures. Handling is good for a midsize sedan, and braking is a non-event, which is a good thing. Seat comfort is very good for long trips with just the right amount of hardness in the seats. Backseat legroom is quite good, and without the panoramic sunroof, most 6 footers won't feel like you're subjecting them to torture in the back seat. The stereo on the GT is fantastic- 8 speakers, and some of the best sound in it's class."
pontiac,g6,2005,JUDI PAYTON, 03/29/2005,MY G6,5,"I love the styling of this vehicle.  It has good crisp lines and the color i bought, stealth gray, is easy to keep clean and looking great.  Driving in the colorado mountains has been a delight with this vehicle.  It climbs right up the mountain for me.  Being a short legged person, i especially like the controls that bring the brake and gas pedal up to me rather than having to sit on top of the steering wheel to drive.  Overall, i am very pleased with the vehicle."
pontiac,g6,2005,G6, 03/29/2005,G6 is a hit,4,"I will admit to being partial to GM and in many cases that is grounds to discount my comments, however, I have driven many cars and the G6 is a superb vehicle by any measure.  In comparison, my fathers 05 Camry is generic, plain and in some cases cheaper feeling. The G6 will impress anyone, if given a chance.  The design inside and out is elegant and well proportioned.    "
pontiac,g6,2005,Melroy Horn, 03/29/2005,"New model, great experience",4,"This is a new mid size line that we found to be excellent for driving in the city and on freeways.  There is more than adequate room and comfort for each passenger and everything for the individual driver is adjustable for his/her comfort, ability to see speedometer and gauges, and pedal reach.  Very economical to drive with the assistance of a drivers information center, we are getting 24mpg in city conditions.  It handles very well on any road condition we have experienced to date.  This car is very well designed and there is no loss of head room in the back seat with the normal sun roof.  We are very pleased with the G6 GT.                     "
pontiac,g6,2005,Frances Nelson, 04/09/2005,Love this car,5,"Car will take off,Just love the inside,lots of room in the truck.Need to make lots more like this."
pontiac,g6,2005,Rick Wilk, 04/09/2005,New G6,4,"I am thrilled with the combination of comfort inside and sporty styling outside.  The car is loaded and under $30K.  The interior feels roomy and very comfortable front and back.  The head room in the back is not as generous, but a small price to pay to get the cool panoramic roof.  You could get picky with it could have this or that, but I think you would have to jump-up to $40k to get it.  They got it right."
pontiac,g6,2005,Brad, 04/11/2005,This car is GREAT!,5,"I really like my new G6.  I also own a 02' Grand Am GT. I still like the Grand Am but the G6 rides smoother, handles better, has more power, is more comfortable, and just seems to have a higher level of build quality.  Im a manufacturing engineer and I look for all the little mistakes people make when they bolt, weld or snap parts together - so far I can't pick out any issues on my G6.  My drive to and from work just got a lot better."
pontiac,g6,2005,jenny, 04/15/2005,I love it!,4,"Sporty and comfortable! I searched for such a car for 5 years. When the G6 came out, I was smitten. Love the energy and sunroof. It;s great to have a stylish American car!"
pontiac,g6,2005,Frank E, 04/16/2005,Pontiac G6,5,"Very reliable and fun to drive. I have to drive 20 miles to work one way and needed to upgrade from an 8 mpg truck. The new G6 has gone above and beyond my expectations by getting over 22 mpg on the streets and I personally have seen over 40-55 mpg on the highway!!! The 6 speaker sounhd system on the G6 is incredible for a stock system, but 2 more speakers would be nice in the rear doors to make it surround sound.. XM radio free for 3 months, and I will be keeping it too. The in-dash cd player is a welcomed convenience in a mid- sized sedan. I love the factory remote start. My opinion of the Pontiac G6 is that GM made an awesome mid-size car suitable for a big guy like me."
pontiac,g6,2005,rick, 04/18/2005,A lot of car for the price,4,"The first impression I had was how quiet this car is. With less than 200 miles on it, we took it on a 300 mile trip. I could'nt believe a car that weighs 3400 lbs. could get 32mpg! This car is roomy and has every option imaginable, with the exception of a built in garage door transmitter. I have yet to discover any defects, inside or out. Handles well and has good performance. I could'nt be happier. "
pontiac,g6,2005,dalejr8faninohio, 04/28/2005,I love my G6,4,"My G6 is my favorite car thus far that I have ever owned. My G6 is fun to drive and I look for excuses to jump in and take off. I origionally went in to look at the Grand Prix and was very impressed with it, however, I drove the G6 and found it was a car I had to have. I got a great deal on it and have thoroughly enjoyed it ever since."
pontiac,g6,2005,HENRY , 04/28/2005,Pontiac g6,4,"G6 driving experience is great, firm and confortable ride, engine has more than enough power, transmission shifts very smoothly, very quiet and great looking interior, instruments very well placed, car interior space is immense, exterior style is eye catching, i previously owned a 2001 grand am, the g6 is such an improvement over the grand am."
pontiac,g6,2005,mary thomas, 04/27/2005,excellent performing car,5,"I love this new car. You ratings are way too low. I can't understand why it isn't rated higher. I researched all of the imorts before I purchased the G6. With the exception of the Mazda 6, there was nothing close to the G6."
pontiac,g6,2005,Klaus, 05/12/2005,Awesome G6,5,"Fell in love with this car from the first time I saw it.  Exterior lines, interior design and chrome-type instrumentation leave top-of-the-line impession normally reserved for $45,000 cars and up.  200 horsepower with 22/32 gas mileage is unbelievable and so far after 600 miles is right on target.  Interior lighting/electronic controls enhance night driving . . . luxurious yet functional effect all around. Just can't say enough about this car; don't miss my ""baby"" Firebird at all (feel guilty I'm not driving it more but it's just a classic backup for me now).  Recommend you step up and enjoy a whole new adventure in driving.  Way to go GM!!!"
pontiac,g6,2005,Victoria, 06/02/2005,I love this car!!!!,5,"The G6 is the best car I have ever owned and I look forward everyday to getting in and driving to run my errands.  As I am a busy mom this car has all the convienience features you could want and more. I will continue to love this car for years to come. This is a great, fun, and very reliable car to own and it is a safe car which makes me even happier."
pontiac,g6,2005,Carol, 06/12/2005,Super,4,I love my G6!!  It is the easiest car to maneuver.  My husband can't wait 'til the weekend arrives so he can drive it too...
pontiac,g6,2005,Edna Kane, 06/14/2005,ILLUSTRIOUS,5,"I liked this car from the first day I saw it in the showroom at the dealership.I now find extra things to dothat involve driving my G6.Whenever I'm driving along, it's like ""wow,look at me"". This car commands an audience. It really makes you feel special to just be driving such a vehicle.The fact that everything can be ajusted to fit your own level of comfort while operating this vehicle is just awesome."
pontiac,g6,2005,R. Jones, 06/28/2005,Honda to G6 and no regret,4,"Was killing time and went to see the G6.  Drove it about 15 miles and bought it. Had been driving a 4 cyl., 5 speed, 2004 Honda Accord, which is a fine car.  But, the only edge the Accord has on the G6 is in the gas milage dept.  Got an excellent ""out the door"" price on the G6 ($18,500, tax included). Like its appearance, handling and pep and the extras thrown into a pretty basic package. Got a sun roof, a super sound system, a 6 disc CD player.  "
pontiac,g6,2005,Anita, 07/24/2005,"New Pontiac Owner, formerly Chrysler",5,"I never thought of owning anything but top of the line Chrysler, my previous vehicle being a 1996 LHS, leather interior, etc.  However, I had sore knees from them being against the dash all the time because I am so short.  I love how the pedals and the steering wheel come to me on the Pontiac G6 and I can now drive in complete comfort with my legs and arms outstretched.  I love the way it handles and its sporty look.  After 20 years with the Chrysler dealership out of town, I am now converted to a dealer in my own town who showed me this great little GT and let me drive it - well, one like it.  Loved it so much, had the dealer trade for one in a neighboring town (they had none left). "
pontiac,g6,2005,jas600, 07/23/2005,Good car overall,4,"I bought this car in March '05, and already have 7200 miles on it.  I just love the look of the car - I bought a black one, so it really stands out with the chrome wheels.  So far, it has gotten fairly good gas mileage (32 mpg highway, and around 27/28 city).  As far as ride goes, it is a lot smoother than my previous car ('01 Grand Am GT), and I feel safer in it.  The only issues I've noticed so far are in the driver and passenger doors.  The door panels  seem to be a little loose, as you can hear a slight (annoying) vibration when you go over bumps in the road, or when you are listening to certain songs with more bass.  And the driver's side door sometimes sounds like it is not closed."
pontiac,g6,2005,yen, 08/17/2005,2005 Pontiac G6,5,This is a GREAT car.  It's got style and performance!  I was pleasantly surprised at the smooth ride and the roomy feel
pontiac,g6,2005,joe, 09/12/2005,pontiac g6 vr,5,have had car for only 1 month but am extremely pleased with comfort driving. It is great driving over rough roads as our city streets are torn up replacing water pipes. Interior is comfortable and everything within reach. Most room in interior of any 6cy. cars I have seen.
pontiac,g6,2005,Eric, 10/20/2005,Fun Car To Drive,4,"I bought this car in september 05 on the employee pricing program.  I got rid of my Mustang for this car.  Although this car doesn't feel as powerful as the mustang when accelerating, I find it way more fun to drive.  It hugs corners very well, it has plenty of power, smooth comfy ride on the highway and a has way more interior room than the mustang. Also, as a bonus, this car should be much better for Canadian winter Driving! I love the interior, very sporty and modern.  The seats are the most comfortable I have ever had.  I am getting great fuel mileage, about 25mpg mixed driving.  I have about 2500 Km on this car in just 3 weeks because I can't stop driving it! Great Car!"
pontiac,g6,2005,Diane, 10/30/2005,"Comfortable, Sporty andFun",4,I spent months trying to decide what car to buy.  I wanted something sporty but comfortable enough to accomodate children and the big shopping sprees.  I find this to be a very easy car to drive with wonderful visibility and great power on the road.  My car came with ON Star and I had an unfortunate situation in which I had to use it and I will never be with out it again.  I am happy with my decision everytime I get in my car. 
pontiac,g6,2005,Scott A Smith, 11/01/2005,Scott A.Smith,5,"I love the g6 sedan after 10 months it is still like new It is so quiet, smooth and very easy to drive. For a Tall person 6'5"" it is one of the most comfortable cars I have ever owned and look foward to the use of this car until the end of my lease."
pontiac,g6,2005,Adam W. Davis, 11/08/2005,Great car-reasonable price,5,"This is a wonderful car to drive and the price is inexpensive for the quality that you get. It could be easily be compared to a honda accord but it is bigger and more comfortable. If you are looking to purchase a great midsize, it is well worth your time to look at the pontiac g-6."
pontiac,g6,2005,recii, 12/11/2005,G6 junk,2,Worst car I've owned to date. Steering locks randomly on curves. Body lines are not straight. Radio malfunctioning. Car has mild stalling problem. Panaromic roof leaks.
pontiac,g6,2005,Bruce Wylie, 02/08/2006,Pontiac GT6 what a car !,5,We are relatively new owners but my wife and I find the design both inside and out to be of a quality found in few vehicles.  The mileage is also great!  The trunk space is not large but more than adequate for this couple in there 60s.  We highly recomend this vehicle!
pontiac,g6,2005,Brenda Sauter, 03/12/2006,Just bought,4,"I've only owned it a week and I love it.  I formally had a Bonneville and I loved that also.  There is a lot of head room in the G6, more even than in the Bonniville.  Gas mileage is better and it is a smooth riding car.  I had my son and son-in-law in the car with me and they are both over 6 feet, they said there was plenty of room.  "
pontiac,g6,2005,MIke1997, 03/24/2006,great car!,5,I have had this car for a year now and have nothing put praise for it.  Not one day of trouble and it has not seen the shop yet.  Very comfortable for highway driving and for around town too.
pontiac,g6,2005,Suanne, 04/20/2006,Former Accord Owner,4,"I had owned a 2002 Honda Accord and was not ahppy with the new design change so decided to look at other makes.  I had almost made the decision to go with a Toyota Solara when we stumbled upon the G6, I ended up getting a lot more car for the money, love the 6 cylinder and the best part is it gets better gas mileage than my 4 cylinder Accord did!  Fun to drive, lot of get up and go.  Only disappointment is they cheaped out on the plastic inside, you can tell it's not the quality that Honda makes but for $6000 less I am not complaining, plus I trade every 2-3 years so not worried about it I am always under warranty.  LOVE the G6!"
pontiac,g6,2005,amc, 05/05/2006,i love my G6 GT!,5,i absolutely love my car! this is my first  car that i can't find one real thing that i  don't like about it. my husband has never liked any of my cars but he refuses to drive his if i'm not using mine. the pick up is great and the outside is just beautiful! the car rides so incredibly smoothly too. you can't ask for a better car.
pontiac,g6,2005,Bill, 06/07/2006,Nice,4,"Good handling, have been getting good gas mileage with good pick up. The drivers seat is uncomfortable at times"
pontiac,g6,2005,SCOTT, 07/02/2006,Best car we've owned,5,this is with out a doubt the best car we've owned. my wife wanted a nissan altima but i looked at both and thought overall the g6 offered the most bang for the buck. my wife liked it also but thought that because she didn't see that many out on the road meant it wasn't a good car. i explained that this model hadn't been out very long. i finally rented an altima for her to see how she liked it. that took care of her doubt. this car drives wonderfully. smooth and quiet. feels like it has more than 205 hp. transmission is perfectly matched to the 3.5l v6. powerful at all speeds. i personaly like the different plastics they used in the interior they're easily cleaned. interior looks good longer.
pontiac,g6,2005,Preston Osborne, 07/11/2006,2005 Pontiac G6 Review,4,"I've owned my 2005 Pontiac G6 for 19 months and it has lived up to its billing as a car that is fun, economical, and dependable.   If it has one drawback it is that you have to get used to using the side view and side mirrors when backing up because of the ""chopped style"" design, but I wouldn't trade that away to compromise on its great look.  "
pontiac,g6,2005,Dee, 08/02/2006,Sporty and unique,4,"I bought this car in May of 05 & so far so good. The car is fully loaded with all the bells & whistles, I got it with the awesome panaramic view. The monsoon sound system is great & the information center is very informative. I like how the interior was layed out, with soft touch material everywhere & very roomy & I compared it to other vehicles in its group & they had hard plastics & small inside. The car's suspension is very good & corners without sceeching the tires. The leather interior is well thought out & great looking. I like the exterior styling with slick looking lines which makes it look sporty. The six way power seat, telescoping, & tilt steering makes it comfortable to drive."
pontiac,g6,2005,n396321, 08/31/2004,great car!!!,5,"Regardless of model, the pontiac 
delivers a sporty driving experience. 
Spring for the GT if you are a serious 
driving enthusiast. Otherwise, you may 
find the standard V6 more comfortable. 
It's smooth and very stable."
pontiac,g6,2005,Lafayette, 09/01/2004,G6 is best in class,5,"200HP, a 0-60 time of less than 8 
seconds, with a ride usually reserved 
for much larger vehicles, the Pontiac 
G6 is a great car.

Gone are the days of plastic body-
moldings.  The G6 is another sign that 
Pontiac is redefining itself as GM's 
performance division.

Drive the Mazda 6, Jetta, and Altima.  
Then and only then drive the G6.  The 
G6 will be the clear winner. "
pontiac,g6,2005,shamus55, 10/20/2004,"style, zip, and economical",5,"Great fuel economy can be found on the 
2005 Pontiac G6 GT. This sporty mid-
size consistently averages 30 to 32 
mpg. The car has plenty of pep when 
asked and handles the road tight and 
crisp.  The sport suspension is a bit 
stiff but is expected.  The rear seat 
leg room is spacious and the new 
panoramic sunroof is an absolute must 
have option. (It is like driving a 
convertable with the windows up when 
the roof is fully opened). The leather 
seating option includes all the bells 
and whistles to satisfy even the most 
demanding buyer.  The G6 GT is a 
pleasure to drive and well worth the 
price tag of $28,000.00 fully equipped."
pontiac,g6,2005,Russell Ruggiero, 10/26/2004,A Real Car from Pontiac,5,"The Epsilon foundation is solid and 
the 17"" wheel and tire package is 
quite stable. The 3.5L is strong off 
the line and should deliver 25 mpg 
overall. The seats and build quality 
of the interior is the best of any 
Pontiac including the GTO. "
pontiac,g6,2005,GTOguy, 10/26/2004,WOW!!,4,"I've been a huge Pontiac buff ever 
since my first car, 1986 Pontiac 6000 
STE, Special Touring Edition, and then 
I thought Pontiac couldn't outdue 
themselves until the G6 came my way.  
This car performs like a BMW, handles 
the turns like and Audi, I love driving 
this car, I can't get enough of it.  
Well done Pontiac, you have another 
winner under your belt.  Any chance of 
bringing back the 6000, that was a 
popular car.    "
pontiac,g6,2005,clairissa, 10/30/2004,I like this car!,4,"This is the second Pontiac I have 
owned.  First was a Pontiac Grand Am 
GT 2 door sport coupe.  It was a 
sporty looking vehicle, but definitely 
not practicel.  The G6GT model offers 
both sportiness with practicality.  
Definitely a fun car to drive, handles 
well and gets good gas mileage.  I'm 
definitely very happy with my decision."
pontiac,g6,2005,B MAC, 11/05/2004,great car,4,"i  recently purchased a GT G6 and I 
have to say that this car is awesome. 
You step on it and u fly, and with the 
clutchless manual you can redline it 
in every gear. The only thing that 
I have had a problem with so far has 
been the 6 disc in-dash cd changer. 
One day it was working fine then I got 
in my car and went to crank up the 
tunes and it wouldnt play the cd. CD 
CHANGER ERROR appeared on the display 
screen and then when i turned off the 
car, the stereo remained on. I plan on 
taking it back to the dealer for under 
warantee repair ASAP. other then that 
minor thing, its a fun car."
pontiac,g6,2005,wcvogeljr, 11/07/2004,Outstanding,5,"I thought this was a re-make of a Grand 
Am ot Grand Prix. I was wrong. This car 
is tight, quiet and performs. A recent 
roadtrip resulted in 30.9 MPG! The 
weather was terrible and the car 
handles fine without the traction 
control. This car turns heads - most 
folks think it's a foreign car. "

from it's stylish looks - for a 4 door 
it's very sporty, it handles like a 
charm and is so much fun to drive.  
The gas mileage is great and the 
interior setup is user friendly.  As a 
current owner of an 02 Grand Am GT, I 
find this car much easier to maneuver, 
better on gas and much more fun to 
drive.  This one's a keeper!    "
pontiac,g6,2005,Brenda23236, 11/13/2004,My grown up car,5,"I bought my G6 because I wanted 
a ""grown-up"" car with bells and whistles 
that was responsible and safe.  I am 
insurance-cost conscious and I wanted 
it to be young and fun.  I found all of 
these things in my purchase.  It is the 
best thing I have done for myself in a 
long time!"
pontiac,g6,2005,M. Hobby, 11/13/2004,I'm Impressed!,5,"I'm impressed with my new G6.  This is 
my first Pontiac and I was a little 
apprehensive in purchasing a first year 
model.  I've had a few first year 
vehicles that have caused me 
nightmares. The feel is above my 
expectations and more!  I love driving 
my new G6 and the LA traffic isn't so 
bad with the stereo system.  I get a 
lot of approving looks and have been 
told that it looks like a BMW or some 
other over priced vehicle.  Thanks 
Pontiac!"
pontiac,g6,2005,Jery S, 11/13/2004,Better than Grand Am,4,"This car is fun to drive. Great 
mileage, good acceleration and 
cornering.  The ride is stiff with some 
road noise and a little wind noise.  
The tires take a cold set in cold 
weather which makes the tires feel like 
they are out of balance until they warm 
up after about 5 miles.  Have some 
rattles which the dealer corrected.  
The electric steering feels a little 
numb but transmits vibration back to 
the driver. I expected more from this 
model. "
pontiac,g6,2005,El Caballo, 12/01/2004,Excellent Car,4,"This car is very sporty in nature and

it's composure in tight situations.  "
pontiac,g6,2005,Mike&Sandy, 12/08/2004,Very Nice Car,4,"We love the new G6 GT.  We've only put 
a few hundred miles on it but have a 
few suggestions, mostly cosmetic.
The V-6 needs more guts
Dual Exhaust should be standard on the 
GT
I was surprised to find a manual rear 
view mirror dimmer!  With all the 
whistles and bells why not an auto 
dimming mirror?
The most annoying thing so far...The 
windshield wipers need new geometry.  
The passenger side  stops right in 
front of the driver on the upswing and 
leaves a line of crud/rain/slush right 
in the center of the driver's view!
I love the handling of the car!
Over all, If Pontiac continues on this 
pace they are def headed in the right 
direction!!!!"
pontiac,g6,2005,Pontiac_man, 12/10/2004,Best Pontiac yet!,5,"I did not purchased the GT model because
I didn't see the need for the upgraded
transmission. If you like doing a lot of
shifting then go for the GT model and
plan on spending additional 3K. I
purchased the one with the panoramic
roof and love it. The editoral says the
back seat roof clearance is too low but
I sat in the back and didn't noticed
that much less room for my head. If your
over 6 feet tall then, yes you're going to
be bumping your head. The interior is
very well laid out. Driver controls are
all in a good easy to reach. The tilt
steering and telescoping column is a
welcome feature. The back seat has a lot
of leg room. The trunk is larger than my
Pontiac GM GT."
pontiac,g6,2005,Black Brad, 12/11/2004,Pontiac Excitement,4,"The overall experience with my G6 has 
been great. This is the best car from 
Pontiac since the Firebird. The ride 
is smooth and solid. It handles 
securely, but lacks a bit of steering 
feel. "
pontiac,g6,2005,david markell, 12/12/2004,G6 review,5,"Car rides very well.  It also has a 
big back seat and has gotten very good 
gas mileage.  So far, very satisfied 
w/purchase."
pontiac,g6,2005,Drusus, 12/20/2004,Excellent.,4,"The G6 is an excellent car, the best 
Pontiac I have ever driven. The 
interior is comfortable, the seats firm 
and supportive, controls easy to 
operate and read. Mine has the 6CD 
Monsoon system, which sounds and feels 
magnificent. The engine is top-notch, 
and the car offers a surprising amount 
of power. The ride is smooth and very 
quiet. Passenger room is at a premium.  
My only issue comes with the electronic 
steering. It transmits very little feel 
of the road back to the driver's hands, 
and is very overboosted at some speeds, 
while the other day in a parking lot I 
had almost no boost at all. It's still 
buggy, I think.
Overall, the G6 is a great vehicle."
pontiac,g6,2005,pontiacg6, 12/23/2004,It's good,4,"This car is fun to drive. Very 
responsive and sporty. It does turn 
heads. I was nervous about a ""first 
edition"" purchase, but have no regrets. 
Pontiac has been reliable in the past, 
so as a new G6 owner, I think I will 
just relax and enjoy it. "
pontiac,g6,2005,izapem2, 01/01/2005,I won it at the Oprah show,5,"I won this car at the Oprah season 
premiere. It is an amazing car. I have 
already put over 3,000 miles on it 
since I received it just before 
Thanksgiving. I have a family of five 
and we all fit very comfortably in it, 
we have even all gone on vacation 
already in it. It also is loaded with 
all kinds of safety features, which is 
important to me since I have children. 
The car handles very well in snow and 
icy road conditions. The back seats 
fold down to give you more trunk space 
which is very nice, I fit a very large 
bookcase in my trunk with no problem. 
So far I have absolutely no complaints 
about this vehicle. I love my pontiac 
G6 GT!!!!"
pontiac,g6,2005,Scott, 12/30/2004,No Remorse,4,"I leased a base G6. To give some 
background I own a Toyota Highlander, I 
never thought I'd get a Pontiac, I hate 
their looks. The G6 looked different so 
I decided to take a look since I knew I 
could get a great deal on one compared 
to a Honda or Toyota.  I only have 250 
miles on mine but can tell you this.  
It handles really well and has a quiet 
and supple ride.  It comes well equiped 
and like the V6.  It is sporty enough 
for me and can handle 2 kids in car 
seats.  It has been fine in the snow 
belt.  My new Consumer Reports rags on 
this car which isn't fair.  I never 
thought I'd defend a Pontiac but drive 
one and judge for yourself. I got more 
bang for the buck which Magazines don't 
consider."
pontiac,g6,2005,fran nardone, 01/01/2005,like it alot,4,"I like the g6 very much.I previously 
owned a grandam that I also liked. But 
the g6 I have to say is so much nicer. 
It is so much better on gas, faster,and 
has alot more room inside,especially 
the back. lots more leg room and so 
much more comfort.I notice a big 
difference in the quietness of the car 
inside when i am driving.I would buy 
this car in a second again. Very fun to

compete with the rest of the world. "
pontiac,g6,2005,Highlander, 01/20/2005,G6 Does Well,5,"I bought my G6 (non-GT) a few months ago now and wanted to express how pleased I am with my purchase.  After much shopping and test driving every vehicle of this type (mid size, reasonably priced sedan) this was the first one that I was excited about after the test drive. It is fun to drive, looks good, feels good and the price was competitive.  I have had no mechanical issues or other problems."
pontiac,g6,2005,Carla, 01/28/2005,Steering Wheel Problems,4,"My husband and I purchased the g6 gt less than one month ago.  It was love at first sight until it was time to parallel park on the streets of New York/New Jersey (which is a must living in the City). After a few left and right turns the wheel suddenly got extremely stiff that it was nearly impossible for my 6'3"" 200 lbs husband to turn the steering wheel any further to park properly.  Took the car back to the dealer to have it tested and he found the same problem.  He contacted GM about problem waiting for a response since it seem to be a manfacture problem.  The dealer also test another car but the wheels were not as stiff."
pontiac,g6,2005,M.Horn(pur for wife), 02/06/2005,Rating Pontiac G6GT,5,We have only had this car for two months but have thoroughly enjoyed it.  A very comfortable car that rides and handles well on both highway and city streets.  The 3.5 V6 is more than adequate considering the size of this car.  Mileage has been averaging 22 mpg with approximately 33% of all driving on a freeway.  The GT model purchased came with almost everything we wanted as standard.  Back seats very comfortable with plenty of floor space.  Trunk space is large and can be expanded with fold down rear seating.  The car is designed with very attractive lines. At this point we are very pleased with our decision to buy it.         
pontiac,g6,2005,Jessica, 02/18/2005,pontiac G6,5,"I love this car!  There is plenty of storage room in the trunk.  I opted for the regular sun roof and there is plenty of room for my 6'2 husband to sit in the back.  The exterior has a sporty look, unlike most other sedans.  And it handled great it the snow."
pontiac,g6,2005,rgilm2468, 03/05/2005,Best Pontiac I Ever Owned,5,"This is my wife's car but I drive it every chance I get. This is our 8th Pontiac, and I would rate it the best. No body side molding, 17 inch wheels make for excellent cornering and panoramic roof is a lot of fun.  I'm 6'2 and it has more than adequate leg room. It looks fairly small from the outside but the cabin is quite large.  Adjustable pedals and telescoping steering wheel would make it hard for anyone not to find a comfortable driving position."
pontiac,g6,2005,link2him@aol.com, 03/07/2005,G6 Rules,4,"A really fun car to drive.  Handles superbly.  Very responsive.  Outstanding leg room.  I have three kids, 6, 8, and 10.  My wife and I took a ride looking at new houses.  Her seat was back far enough that her legs were straight and the kids had more leg room than in my Envoy."

pontiac,g6,2005,Sgtickles, 03/15/2005,I love it!,5,"This is my first brand new car and I absolutely love it.  I like that it has the look and feel of a fun, sporty car but the convenience of a sedan.  It is very spacious, handles really well, and is so much fun to drive.  I would recommend this car to anyone."
pontiac,g6,2005,Chris Earley, 03/19/2005,The All New G6,5,"This G6 is the best car i have ever had. It is really fun to drive. When you step on the gas then the other cars should just say bye-bye. The interior is the nicest and most creative there is out there. If your ready for a new car or ready for a change in your life, then the G6 is just right for you. And let's not forget that sunroof. What more is there to say about that sunroof. So if you want to stand out and let people notice you then do what you have to do to get this G6."
pontiac,g6,2005,Dawna, 03/23/2005,"Great Car, Fun to drive!!",5,"I honestly didn't consider it when i was looking for a new car, but I am sooo glad i got it. I absolutely love it.  It handles great on the road, very roomy and comfortable, yet sporty enough to hang with 'em all.  Pontiac did great thinking up this car...."
pontiac,g6,2005,Buddy04, 03/23/2005,Great Experience,4,"I have had several Pontiacs, traded down from an '04 Grand Prix.  Think it competes well against the Japanese competition.  Much better attention to detail and interior than the Grand Prix.The sound system is simply awesome."
pontiac,g6,2005,cdog13junior, 03/23/2005,fast and fun,5,"I have a 2004 Pontiac Grand AM and I recently bought the base model G6 I have really enjoyed the car since I bought it in late Feb of this year. The handling is so nice, quick and responsive. I have found that just the difference in one year that Pontiac has came out with some really nice innovations like the optional assist a steer. I have no complaints about the car and now have 1700 miles and love the car. Will buy one again anyday"
pontiac,g6,2005,birdhouse, 04/01/2005,so far not bad,4,"The car seems to be pretty good. I traded a 2001 honda EX 6cyl for it. My biggest complaint is that there is no light in the glove box (shame on you G.M.). I also do not like the high performance tires. I will be lucky to get 15,000 miles out of them. And they make high sounds when you hit any little thing on the road. The trunk popper is very user unfriendly. The steering is a bit unusual. In Florida we really don't need heated seats. That could have been an option. All in all, I like the car and time will tell the rest. "
pontiac,g6,2005,Robert Gould, 04/07/2005,One Nice Car,5,"I have gotten several compliments on this car.I really like it alot, especially compared to the other Grand Ams I own. It definately is fun to drive.It has alot of room for passengers or cargo and love the great mileage as well. The Pontiac G6 looks expensive and has a look all it's own."
pontiac,g6,2005,Darcelle Strother, 04/21/2005,Love My G6,4,Pontiac has come up with a reasonable price vehicle with luxury features.  It has the quality and comfort that are not present in foreign vehicles.  Smooth ride and easy to handle.
pontiac,g6,2005,Milyn2, 04/24/2005,Fun and comfortable,5,I love this vehicle.  It is very responsive and has plenty of power.  The Panoramic sunroof is an incredible feature that adds to the enjoyment.  It is well designed and very consumer friendly.
pontiac,g6,2005,Car lover, 04/24/2005,I love this car!,5,This car is the most fun to drive I have ever driven in 50 plus years.  It has all the options that I want or need except a compass and I can get one of those lots of places.  The seats are totally comfortable.  It has great pick up off the line.  The sound system makes me feel like I am in a concert hall.  I love this car!

pontiac,g6,2005,happy owner, 04/26/2005,Hapy owner,5,Great car.  The only thing I would change are the rear taillights... look like a Neon.  The Coupe's rear end looks sharp.  I wish the 4 door had a similar rear end.
pontiac,g6,2005,Dawna, 04/27/2005,"Great Car, Fun to drive!!",5,Its been a wonderful car and does have great handling!  Very sporty car and can definitely keep up with the higher price sedans anyday 
pontiac,g6,2005,DON, 05/21/2005,Great,4,"The comfort and gas milage was the most suprising.  I am 6'3"" and get in and out with ease.  We made a trip of over 2000 miles and could not have ask for more comfort.  We previously has a grand prix and the g6 compares to it."

pontiac,g6,2005,MikeG, 06/05/2005,Very Pleasant Surprise!,4,"I paid $15,700 for this car with employee discount and crazy rebates. All in all, a great new car for a price range in which I was only finding 40-60,000 mile 3.5L Altimas. Engine powerful, but needs a little more oomph against competition. ""Touring"" suspension in base models make car feel bigger than it is, only reason to pay more for GT. Overall the ride is very good. ""Value leader"" automatic brings back memories of my Olds Intrigue, not really a sporty feel. Back seat looks huge. Body styling looks import inspired, slightly generic but very sharp. Fit and finish seem great, especially for the price range. Something a little different from GM, and I've had a lot of GM cars."
pontiac,g6,2005,Greeneyesva, 06/16/2005,My G6,5,The car is a dream to drive and handles effortlessly.  It corners great and is heavy enough but not like a mack truck!  This has to be the best car I have ever bought!!
pontiac,g6,2005,Carl, 06/07/2005,This Is A Must See Vehicle,4,"Performance is very good - no problem accelerating into rush hour traffic on I-95. Panoramic sunroof is closest thing to a convertible w/o the headaches. Minor wind noise at high speed closed, but dealer fixed - no noise and no leaks.  Great styling - classy car. We love it! It's the best car we've had."
pontiac,g6,2005,Joe S., 06/16/2005,Couldn't be happier!,5,"First car I bought out of college. Has everything I wanted in a car and it's so much more car for the money compared to comparable cars. Roomy (I'm 6'4""), really quick but great gas mileage (last car was an SUV), handles really well, great features but not 'gadgety,' very driver oriented, and great styling. I would recommend this car to anyone in a second. No joke, my calendar was booked for 2 weeks with people from work who wanted me to take them out to lunch so they could check out the car. They all loved it too."
pontiac,g6,2005,beerdude, 06/30/2005,G6 GT much fun to drive!,4,Excellent handling.  Very peppy engine regardless of what the others say of the lack of 240hp.  200hp is plenty for 99% of the population.  The panoramic roof is way too cool and actually works quite well.  Tall folks may hit their head in the back. The monsoon sound system is pretty decent for factory rig.  Absolutely love the exterior styling and wheels.  Love the car so far ... after having an Accord and Mazda 6 and Mazda 626.
pontiac,g6,2005,Vigla, 07/02/2005,Not bad at all,4,"You'll do well with this car as it is not overly expensive and has very good fit and finish for a Pontiac.  It's a sharp handling car and it has enough power so that you feel you can punch it once in a while.  Compared to an Accord, it certainly looks better, has a V6 instead of a 4 cyl for the same price and has a ton more options.  XM Radio is a nice feature.  Side Airbags are a must and mine has them.  OnStar was included as well.  "
pontiac,g6,2005,Terry, 07/14/2005,This is a fun car!,4,"I was attracted by the design and the fact that it is GM. I guess I want GM to succeed. I looked at all the similar Japanese models & domestics, even looked at a LaCrosse. This is a replacement for my '00 Intrigue that I loved, so the LaCrosse seemed about just right.  After 3 wks I have over 2200 mi. on the G6 and I have no major complaints about it so far. With GM employee discount, $1K for being an Olds owner, & points on my GM card, I paid about $20K for this G6 GT that had a sticker price of about $28K. I hope after 30K mi., I'm not disappointed.  Time will tell. The dealer experience was great; they went out of their way to find me the exact car I wanted, brought it from 200 mi. away."
pontiac,g6,2005,Steve, 08/01/2005,Finally an exciting Pontiac,4,"It drives like no other sedan on the road today. It does not handle like a sedan in the sense that you have to pay attention to what you are doing, and in this day of people yapping away on a cell phone this could be a blessing. It fun to drive and I find myself driving more than I used to drive. The cosmetics of the interior are uninspired with the notable exception of the gauge cluster. Acceleration is crisp and the sport shift 4-speed is just plain fun. The seats are comfortable for long trips or the short hop to the grocery store, but are forewarned, space in the boot is cramped. Two thumbs up, Pontiac finally put some excitement back into their basic grocery getter. "
pontiac,g6,2005,Dan, 08/03/2005,"G6 GT, its a great car",4,"I've had my G6 since January and its got almost 20k miles on it. I have had my fair share of problems but for the most part its been great. The major problem is the car doesnt start right most of the time and when you hit 5000+ RPMs the engine screams, literally. Everything else was just small stuff that either got fixed at the dealership or just went away on its own. They need different tires or something, i went to the dealership and they told me the tires need to be replaced within 10k miles, somethings up with that. Anyways the car is a blast to drive, its got every option but the bigger sunroof. Its go really crappy gas milage i found out, im lucky if i get 20mpg. "
pontiac,g6,2005,Tim, 09/02/2005,Simply Awesome!,5,"This is the first brand new car that I have owned, and I know that I made a great choice.  Cars have never been so much fun for me until now.  The 200 horsepower V6 is definitely enough power for me.  I am honored to own a 2005 model, because it is the first year that the G6 was introduced.  I am very happy with my choice."
pontiac,g6,2005,Love My GT G6, 09/21/2005,I love my 2006 G6,5,"This was the first car in a while that was mine.  I wanted a convertible, my wife did not.  We settled on the Panoramic sunroof.  Wonderful. The feel of a convertible without the intense sun. The auto stick is fun.  I average around 27 mpg overall.  The red with the chrome wheels sets it off. The leather seats are comfy.  The monsoon radio is great, even with all windows down and top open.  The A/C is cold and the car is very comfortable.  Best of all it is a blast to drive.  It is noticed by everyone and just looks sharp"
pontiac,g6,2005,G6Action, 10/04/2005,Love my G6 GT,5,"No problems so far (knock on wood). After driving the Honda Accord and Chrysler Sebring, I chose the G6....much more fun to drive and I get looks everywhere I go as to 'what kind of car is THAT?'  Gas mileage is better than the listed 21/29mph as I get 25.6 consistently in town."
pontiac,g6,2005,giarc4, 10/17/2005,G6 - myBest Pontiac yet!!,5,"Handling is tremendous, the car really holds most any curve thrown at it. The 3.5L engine easily hits passing gear on the highway with respectable fuel economy.  The passenger view from the backseat of this car should be that of a car twice its size. The G6 is flat out a GREAT PACKAGE. "

pontiac,g6,2005,Scott, 11/03/2005,I love my G6,4,I really enjoy my G6. I have had many great trips in my car. I love the roomy backseat (and my kids love it too.) I have even turned a few people on to the car. My grandfather is wanting to buy one as soon as he sells his current car. A true MUST HAVE!!

pontiac,g6,2005,MgmFlyer, 11/22/2005,Foreign Engineering or Clone?,5,"Is the G6 a foreign clone?  GM did this one right!  Power, comfort, quality control and affordability rolled up in a single vehicle.  My G6 consistently exceeds the 32 mpg highway mileage on interstate trips.  Lots of interior space and comfort for a vehicle that stickers for under $24K with all the appointments (sunroof, xm, and a V-6)."
pontiac,g6,2005,Boss, 12/21/2005,Plastic Fun,4,The '05 G6 is a nice ride. It's sleek and refined body make it appealing to look at while its chasis and supension make it smooth and fun to drive. The only concern I have is the amount of hard plastic throughout the cabin. In all I enjoy my G6 and am content with my purchase

pontiac,g6,2005,rabbit, 03/20/2006,Excellent car for the size,4,"Great car.  Love the factory remote start.  Better mileage than the Camry, we get 32-34 mpg on a trip.  Had a few mechanical problems - electric steering failed and had to be replaced under warranty.  Definitely would buy another.  "
pontiac,g6,2005,andrew y, 01/09/2007,very nice,5,This car by far the nicest design concept for a Pontiac sedan. the exterior is aerodynamic where it needs to be and has a good ground stance. the engine is responsive and powerful for a 3500 cc engine and the wheels have good traction. the only thing this vehicle needs (well actually gm needs) is to get rid of the amount of plastic the interior has. but overall the interior is roomy and comfortable.
pontiac,g6,2005,Dziewczyna, 01/14/2007,Maybe you'll find this helpful,4,"I reviewed cars for months before I got into the G6.  I've owned it now 16 months and I have to say its the first car I've had this long that I still like. Generally I get bored fast and want something new.  It recently snowed in Seattle and I found the TC to be a royal pain. It wouldn't let me speed up to get the momentum to get up the hill.  The TC kept coming on and my tires kept spinning. When I turned the TC off.. still couldn't make it up. Recently my windshield freezes on the inside.  When the sunroof is open IT IS SO LOUD, almost not worth having it  I've seen others complain about a bouncing speedometer and I've also had this problem took it to the dealer and they didn't find anything"
pontiac,g6,2005,Doc, 01/31/2007,Good Value,4,Don't get the panel roof. GM can't\won't fix the rattles. There is a known flaw in the 6disc CD changer where auto sound level gets disabled if you use RSD.
pontiac,g6,2005,Sara Brown, 01/30/2007,This car is horrible,2,"This car is horrible it has spent more time in the shop than out on the road.  Brakes replaced twice, electrical system needed to be re-wired, gears in steering column replaced, and now a problem with the anti-theft system.  This car is noisy (rattles) and badly constructed interior (as far as position of instruments).  Seats are made of horrible material that does not wear well (single business women who weighs 115 lbs, so driver's seat should not be falling apart).  Dealership hates to service car.  I hate driving it, cant wait until it is paid off so I can get rid of it!"
pontiac,g6,2005,Kevin, 04/03/2007,The Best Car for the money,5,"I love this vehicle. This having been the fourth vehicle I've ever owned, I've always purchased vehicles of this size. This one's the best. I love how it drives on the highway, and yet is still fun to drive in town as well. Not to mention that I look good driving it. I was skeptical at first about the fusion orange color, but now I love it. "
pontiac,g6,2005,Liz, 04/17/2007,Best American car,5,"I have had mine and have no problem with it.  It is the best car I have ever driven. The side mirrors and rearview mirror are needed a little more than on most cars, but if you can drive you can handle it. I would not trade this car for anything. I have had no problem with it. I drive it without abusing it. My family is constantly calling it the ""show car"" because I am washing it every week. I would recommend this car if you want reliability and most of all fun. We are all tall in my family and all have enough room in it. Great sound system also. Fantastic 8 speaker stereo system. Pontiac really got it together with  this car. I hope they keep making it. My next car will be a G6.  "
pontiac,g6,2005,ed, 06/17/2007,Great car,5,"I bought this car used about a month ago and smile every time I look at it. It is very fun to drive and the steering is so light you can turn it with one finger. There is enough acceleration for me and still gets in the high 20s for gas mileage. I also like how it is so quiet even at speeds above 70. I live in central Minnesota so the remote start and traction control is a great option to have. The sound system is great even for being the base system. The driver information center is a nice feature, it has avg speed, mpg, oil life, and others. The back seat is enormous even for taller people. This is a great car and if you need a sporty car that is very reliable this is it."
pontiac,g6,2005,DocWyeth, 06/28/2007,4Dr GT Loaded w/Panoramic Roof,4,"At 6'4"" I love this car. Tilt and telescoping steering wheel have come in handy. My shorter daughter loves the 6 way seat. I rarely use the air (temp has to be 90+) because it is so nice to tool down the road with the roof open. This car is the most neutral car to drive. No over or understeer. Upgrade the tires from the OEM and you have a great sports car. I don't car for the driver info center being incorporated in the radio. You can't upgrade the radio. Gas mileage is 26.3 for the life of the car and on trips to Florida we have 30mpg+ at 80mph, Wow. If you have a heavy foot at lights expect to get under 25mpg."
pontiac,g6,2005,Char, 09/25/2007,Used 05 Pontiac G6,5,"I bought my G6 just 3 days ago. I bought it used I might add and got a really great deal on it.  Whomever owned it prior took great care of it. It looks brand new and has 26500 miles on it. I was sad to trade in my beloved Mustang, but as my kids are teens now and my son is almost 6 foot, sadly I had no choice as he was scrunched in the back seat. I also own a 96 Pontiac Sunfire with 145,000 miles on it and still kicking. So I know how good Pontiacs are. They are reliable that's why I bought the G6. It is a sharp looking sedan too and I am thus far glad I bought it, even if it was used. It's got a lot of pep for a sedan which is nice being I owned the Mustang prior. Also handles like a dream"
pontiac,g6,2005,89Stang, 07/13/2007,Perfect Everyday Car,4,"My old 93 Grand Prix had 130k on it and it was time for something new. I needed another car with a little kick, V6 and something I'd love driving for my daily 50 mile commute to work. I already have a sports car, so I didn't need a V8, but I wanted something w/ a little puch to it. I had good luck with my Grand Prix so I gave the G6 a look. I've had the car for about 5 months, put on 8K already on it and I love it the more I drive it.  Engine creeps up on you and before you know it your doing 80 w/o breaking a sweat. Great seats, like the interior layout and info center. Sporty looking style for a 4 door. Surprisingly good room in back seat and I get 26-28 mpg with good power. Great car.  "

I was at the Pontiac dealership yet again with my Grand Am and the G6 caught my eye from the sales lot, mainly the price tag, $14,995 with only 8,720 miles Certified! I test drove it and drove it home the next day! I find it very comfortable considering I'm 6'4"" even with 5 people in the car and it still has plenty of pick-up. I drive about 100 miles a day, mostly highway and average 25 mpg @ 75 mph w/ the 3.5L V6 which was the only way I would get one. It is responsive with plenty of power, a smooth, quiet ride and great handling"
pontiac,g6,2005,Miss49079, 03/25/2008,Disappointed,3,"I bough my car about 5 months ago and Loved it. I researched the G6 for months before my purchase and test drove many. I owned a Grand Am GT1 previous to this that I absolutely loved. I found out one thing with this car that has sent me looking for another... it's horrible in the winter. I have never had so many issues or problems driving in the snow until I got this car. I have had one accident that could have been worse then it was due to the no T/C or ABS being on the car. I thought when purchasing that ABS was a standard feature, boy was I wrong. I am now doing what I can to trade the car in on something with a better braking system and that I feel safe driving."

Has everything! 2 weeks later, electronic accel control goes out and the radio reads 'engine power reduced' Got that fixed. 1 week later it happens again. dealer says it was a faulty part so they fixed it. 2 weeks ago I noticed that when I press the brakes on the highway the car shakes horribly. Dealer says the alignment is good. Then last week I pull into aco-workers driveway, and the yellow wrench light comes on and says low coolant. Checked coolant and no problems. Right on the full line. Now today from coming out from wal-mart, starter seized. DONT buy this car! LEMON!!"

After buying my Pontiac G6 it was in the shop two days later: Brakes, and seat belt not working. few more weeks and the fan motor was replaced. now I'm living with a hard start. Also the radio not being on with start of car which resets all my info in the radio. For you that don't own, one your oil life, trip mileage, temp, time, security items, set radio stations and many more things. Also had the deal check my shocks, struts and brakes again. car sounds like it will fall apart when i hit bumps in road. i know i did not buy a expensive car but come on Pontiac take pride in your cars.

pontiac,g6,2005,Canuck, 05/28/2008,new till now,4,"Had for Sunfires and son totaled the one that was paid off.  Needed a car and was glad I stepped up to the G6.  After reading many reviews I can agree with most all.  Love it and fun to drive; drove across Canada 5 times.  As well experienced many of the problems - Electric steering had to be replaced (warranty), brakes need new rotors, or at least turned spring and fall.  I do myself so more just a pain.  During the winter the inside of the windshield freezes.  Oil changes have been regular when told by the info center; about every 7000 miles.  No problems driving in heavy snow (Canadian 30 cm - about 12 inches) with OEM tires.  Many 4x4's were getting stuck; might be more driving ability."

I have put over 197,000 miles on this vehicle.
Of course, I have had regular routine work such as brakes and rotors.
Have had a wheel bearing replaced.

My breaks needed changed after awhile and I put the best ceramic pads on and cheaper rotors. Had loud squeky brakes til I put acid wheel cleaner on the rotors to get the glaze off. Wheel bearing hub assembly went out around 60k on front passenger was $120 to fix myself wasnt hard. Thats the only thing thats gone wrong. Get your transmission fluid and filter change at 50k and every 30k after. Its only $80. Changed spark plugs today cost $44.88 dealer reccomends changing at 100,000 miles but mine were definitly due at 75,000. Use the oem ac delco plugs ""iridium"".

I fell in love with the car once I saw it and was able to drive it around. Now that the newness has worn off I started to notice some rather significant problems with the vehicle. Water leaks into the B pillars (where the seat belts are mounted) whenever it rains. Took a closer look and found MOLD in the insulation. Upon closer inspection, found that there are holes where at the front of the rear windows at the top and bottom that lead behind the B pillar. If you own one of these, check your windows too because unless you get a hard rain, you most likely will not notice the leak. Not happy."

Main problem with these cars is the passenger side headlight. GM used a sub quality harness which plugs the headlight assembly into the main harness. It overheats and melts (if yours hasn't yet, it will) Best thing to do is bypass the plug wiring in your own spade connectors. Headlight ground went on it too, had to wire my own. Wish there was a recall on this. Sometimes I get a check engine light which is accompanied by hard shifts. It clears up on its own. Drivers door seal leaks water. Other than that, just brakes and normal ware items. Overall car is very reliable."

It was overpriced and a piece of garbage with all sorts of mechanical problems. Total waste of money. I leased an Infinity G 35 Coupe and loved the car. It was fast, beautiful, and fun to drive. The reason why I got rid of it because it was not ingress and egress friendly for babies. G 6 GTP has almost identical performance 0-60 6.2 seconds compared to G35 6.1 seconds. The G 6 GTP Sedan is beautiful inside and out and offers outstanding performance (Faster than the 2004 mustang gt with the 260 horse). I know beacuse I beat them all the time. G6 GTP really changed my views of American cars."
pontiac,g6,2006,Michael , 08/29/2006,Great Car,5,I recently went out and bought a red Pontiac G6 for my wife. She loves everything about the car. It is smooth quiet and easy to drive and it looks great. I have a co-worker who had just bought a new V6 Honda Accord and then saw my wifes G6 say I wish I had one of those. My wifes G6 has the 3.5 V6 it has a good amount of power and gets great gas mileage. The interior is very roomy. All of the audio and climate controls are big and easy to use. My wife loves the interiors look and feel but it does use some cheaper materials than it competitors. I would have say that people shopping in this segment should take a serious look at the G6. It is a great car especially for the money.

Take note that i have maintained this car, but at same time i have also pushed it to limits over the past couple years trying to get a true feel of quality. The only issues/problems i have had personally are as follow:  1) transmission started going out at around 140k miles (I wasn't always gentle on the car, trying to see life performance of parts).   2)The oil filter adapter needed replaced at around 120k (not common part to go out, guessing a fluke). 3)minor exhaust leak near manifold @ around 110k. 4)rear deck speakers have blown (great sounding monsoon, which i have given much abuse as well.)    The transmission rebuild was just under2k, and well worth it for what i have gotten out of this car so far.

I have lost reverse twice and they had to replace the shifter   The sun roof (not panoramic) has leaked 3 times and the dealer has had to replace the carpet.  When the car works I love to drive it but it doesn't work long before it breaks.  I have spoken to 2 different GM reps and they refuse to replace the car.  I am just a few days short of meeting the lemon law requirements and will be asking that they buy the car back.

pontiac,g6,2006,Ray, 11/05/2009,NOT TO SHABBY,4,I bought the car online and after i paid i read all the bad reviews. my experience with the car has be mostly positive the only problem i had was with the brakes. i replaced the brakes myself(ceramics of course)and i replaced the rotors at the same time because of all the reviews about them. i feel if pontiac is more sport orientated they would use some decent rotors. a few other problems ive encountered is my throttle body keeps getting dirty and the car clunks and rattles. for a car with such a big engine it get between 33 and 29MPG (60-90 MPH).the sound system is great. i had to replace the radio(6 disc)and just got an aftermarket and got a device to replace the DIC.all in all a good car

I have had some issues, but nothing that wasn't expected out of a vehicle with over 100,000 miles that wasn't maintained properly.
Everything still works on it, and nothing major has gone bad.
The most I've had to do was replace back rotors and brake pads after I got it because they had been let go for way too long. It's a joy to drive, the perfect balance of feedback and comfort.
It has a good pick up to it, and wouldn't have any issues at highway speeds if I didn't have a bent wheel (aftermarket wheels).

After I replaced the cap the engine light went off, but came back on a week later. I called the mechanic back and he told me that I may have a leak so that's my next mission.

I get around 26 mpg on the highway. Hint: Use a product called STP gas treatment at every other fill up and you will increase your mpg. I can't imagine another car I would rather have. The only thing I would change is the cloth seats, I would rather have the leather ones, they are much more comfortable and durable, but these clean up pretty easy using Blue Coral.. Happy driving!"

The legendary Camry isnt all it's stacked up to be.  I owned 2 Camrys and Now, I realize it is mostly the Media who hates american cars.  I find the Pontiac G6 to be better in almost every way than the 05 Camry.  It has more power and about the same fuel economy as the 4 cyl Camry.  I find no cars really get the advertised fuel economy they are supposed to. No sqeeks or rattles like the Camry and the Transmission is flawless and knows when to shift, unlike the Camry.  The camry is a good car, but the G6 is alot more exciting and performs better.  The interior build quality is better."

You can see where they cut corners to keep the cost affordable, but its not terrible. I miss the memory seat, home link, and leather trim on the doors. But you can live with it. Having the retractable button overhead is uncomfortable also cause you have to keep it depressed til it is complete. Holding your hand over your head even though it's not that long, about a minute, feels alot longer. Absolutely NO trunk space, even with the top up. But does seat 4 comfortably. We love it."
pontiac,g6,2006,Zach W, 03/12/2019,My first car,4,"The first car I ever drove was a Pontiac G6. It was a great car at the time. Had decent fuel mileage and relatively low maintenance costs.

pontiac,g6,2006,Dave, 08/27/2015,Leave this car where it is now: used car lot or ju,2,"Bought at 30,000 miles and when slicked up and detailed it looked alright at first and I was hypnotized by the convertible top. I was wanting some power and was expecting the mpg to not be that great with a sporty ride. The problem is, as the car gets older the already poor mpg gets much much worse 16 in city (more like 10) and 24 highway (more like 18). The coolant system is a patchwork mess of connectors and hoses and none of the plastic connectors can be found anywhere but the dealer (for as long as they make parts). This system has leaked since I bought it and no mechanic was able to find a leak no matter how many I took it to.

Drivers wheel hub assembly went out right at 60 thousand just like clockwork like so many others (with the other side to soon follow).  Paint peeled off outside windshield panel on drivers side. Should have took a longer look at the paint quality when I bought it cause it is more poor than even the cheapest cars. The leather is durable but didn't ever feel high quality to me. Felt more like vinyl to me.  Seat leather was starting to split but was repaired. Exhaust started to hiss when accelerating. Interior should have been looked at longer when purchased cause there are no good materials or even good plastics here. Just hard hard cheap plastic that needs to be kept in a garage cause the sun and age has made it look horrible after three and a half years even with using visors in front and back. 
  AC control group back light burned out and the cheap leds are soldered in and can not be changed out easy. Have to get a new control panel for the AC controls. Gear shift lights went off as well and can't see the gear you are in without turning on overhead lights.

 I overheated on the highway and I soon realized my slow leak was a busted heater core at 110,000. All this was despite always having the maintenance done regularly all fluids changed on time. The engine was still solid though  (not sure though if any damage was done to the heads cause of overheat). The fun factor is awesome with the top down though, except the door sill is rather high and you have to raise your seat all the wait up and you still feel like you are in a bathtub with wheels cause you are still low inside the car. 

The top has always rattled when driving over rough roads and the dealer said it was normal and that they all did that even when new. I found paperwork in the glovebox after purchase that said original owner had top repaired under warranty. I never had engine or transmission problems but after reading the horror stories and realizing that the magical 150,000 mile mark for the transmission to fall out (as 80 percent of owners will tell ya) was soon approaching, I decided to drop it like the dying horse it was. It needed  at least a couple thousand in parts to make it just reliable again on a car that was in its ninth year already.  Some parts were starting to be hard to find and I wasn't wanting to see what was gonna go next. I had been very lucky already not to have had the powertrain go yet.  It's currently sitting on a crummy used car lot at an absolute insane price 10 grand after tax, tag, and title. 10 grand for a dead brand that is made cheap  and usually never sees much over 150,000 miles.  Most pontiacs are in the junkyard and that's sadly where this brand should go.  GM really went cheap on a car that could have saved the company. I wanted to support America and buy American, but they are all junk next to even the cheapest foreign cars and my livelihood depends on a good car So I went asian as so many others have.

pontiac,g6,2006,Ken Davis, 02/23/2010,A reason to buy elsewhere,3,"The Pontiac G6 convertable is not a well made car. Since driving off the lot the roof has rattled,trim has come loose, paint quality is poor,and the muffler has developed leaks twice. However the engine and transmission have been trouble free.The 1st year of ownership resulted in at least six weeks in the dealer for the mentioned quality issues. Complaints through customer service resulted in a waste of time as no one really cared. Having owned many GM products in the past it comes as no suprise that the company's lack of quality and customer service resulted in the demise of the Pontiac brand. No one wants the cars and I have, as we all do the ability to buy elsewhere that is not GM.    "
pontiac,g6,2006,jpontiac, 08/12/2013,Best car yet!,4,"This car was the 4th car I have owned, and I was warned always to not buy this brand because of the way pontiacs usually turn out to be, But I love my car! its by far my favorite and im pretty sure I will drive this car until it just wont go anymore! I just love the way it drives and the way it handles, also its very spacious and great to take on long trips! The people who are having many problems are victims of cars that were not maintained and to be honest the way that they drive. If you drive it easy it will last you forever :)"
pontiac,g6,2006,chuck203, 01/25/2015,06 GTP is piece of crap!!!!,3,"the 1st yrs i had this car is what great, but then the flood waters opened, at 49.000miles major oil leak, had that repaired, i have replaced brakes and rotors 3 times in 2 yrs, had 2 replace tire rods and ball joints, car still shakes when u brake, passenger side headlight keeps blowing out, c d player, quit working, Gm wants 600.00 4 a new 1 & 2 top it all off transmission has went out all with less than 100.000 miles on it...I c why pontiac went Under!!!"
pontiac,g6,2006,Holly, 11/02/2010,Uh oh,3,"Bought this car with 19,000 miles on it. Replaced mirror covers several times. Uncontrollably shakes while breaking. Clicking sound when turning and now with 61,000 miles on it my engine smells of burning and a metal rubbing sound with acceleration. Highly upset and do not recommend to anyone."
pontiac,g6,2006,bucaboi, 10/31/2006,Nothing but problems!!!,3,"My biggest mistake in life so far has been purchasing this vehicle. NO JOKE. So far I've had nothing but problem after problem with this horrible car. The engine is great. I love the power, the steering, the design of the body. But when you get past all that and everything just seems to fall apart starting the 2nd day after you bought it, you get a little upset. Let me just tell you a couple of the problems i've had.........sunroof doesn't work (took it in 4 times and still nothing), sunroof and side pillars leak when it rains (causing carpet and seats to grow mold),......ABS,traction control, and airbags stopped working. car shakes when braking, rotors and brake pads replaced."
pontiac,g6,2006,scholar65, 06/18/2012,ONE OF THE BIGGEST MISTAKES EVER MADE!!!!,1,"I am not one to write reviews but I have to write a review on this car.
I hate I ever bought this car.
Unreliable is an understatement.
After about 3 months the car began to shift hard.
Had that fixed (so called), and about 9 months after that it is doing the same thing.
Had brakes and rotors done on a car I haven't even had over a year.
My rotors were rusted for some reason.
I have a camry that I've had for 10 years and never experienced rusted rotors but I digress.
Point blank, stay away from buying this car.
It is a POT (Piece Of Trash)"
pontiac,g6,2006,Brian, 10/18/2006,Buy something else,2,"I loved my new G6 the first couple months, then alot of problems happened. First the headlight gasket split leaving moisture in my light. Then I experienced shaking and a knocking noise when braking.  Also my sunroof had a leak plus I have a really annoying squeaking noise somewhere around my dash which my dealership still has not fix.  So buyer beware!!!  I can't believe I traded in my Camaro for this car.  UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!!!!"
pontiac,g6,2006,jefferywayne, 03/09/2011,Please Dont Buy,3,this car is fast and fast to break down. problems started as early 30k mi. the water pump was the first to go. that was wierd cause the car was new.then after that it was the battery. mind you that every part that i took i replaced with the top of the line parts available. i finally came up with the rasio that for every 1 new part put on the car 3 more parts broke. then the lower control arm snapped.wheel hub assemply went out. oil drain plug decomposed and the list continues. from transmission shifting hard to total loss of horsepower and deallights failing. just dont buy the car. when it works the car is gorgious and fast. 
pontiac,g6,2006,gmletmedown06, 06/03/2015,My Last General Motors Vehicle Purchase EVER!,3,"I purchased a 2006 Pontiac G6 V6 3.5L with 40,000mi in 2/2007. At the time, I wanted to invest in a GM model vehicle because I wanted to stand by American made cars. Well, sad to say, that I will never purchase another GM vehicle in my lifetime. I can't even count on one hand how often I had to service the brakes, rotors, ball joints, headlights, and tail lights. Just recently I received a recall notice. When I took it in to have it serviced, there was not only 1 recall, as it was stated on the notice, but 3!!! So sad what the American car has become. My odometer just hit 151,000mi and the transmission is starting to go. Time to explore the foreign market!"
pontiac,g6,2006,jed_460, 07/25/2011,Warning!!!!!,1,"This car is by far the worst car I have ever owned.
At 47,000 miles i had my 2nd pair of rotors put on. At 50,000 I had struts replaced. At 70,000 my cd player went out. At 75,000 My transmission needed to be rebuilt along with the catalytic converter and all of the o2 sensors.
 It seems like every time I have fixed it; it breaks down again.
This could just be my experience but I would not wish this on anyone.
I am at about $4,000 in repairs and the car is only worth about $5,000."
pontiac,g6,2006,LFT, 04/24/2006,Questions unanswered,3,"The car needs work.   It isn't too bad for the price, but the small 2.4L should get better MPG and the same old GM issues with never correcting anything exists."
pontiac,g6,2006,thirst234, 03/02/2012,P.O.S. please dont buy. JUNK!!!!,2,"Bought a 2006 g6, I've had it about almost 2 yrs now. I've changed the brakes and rotors 6 times already, I've had 4 aligments done, I've had to replace some kind of sensor, had to replace tie rod and wheel bearings twice on passenger side, and the biggest thing is about a week ago i find out i need to replace my steering column and a intermediate shaft. With all the money i put into this car i could of paid it off by now or bought a new one...
I've read a lot of reviews and everyone is having these same issues with their cars. So if enough of us write to the headquaters maybe they'll put out a recall like the other company's have. DONT BUY THIS CAR, ITS A MONEY PIT."
pontiac,g6,2006,Sandra, 08/02/2008,I LOVED my GTP but now she's gone,4,"I bought this car used in Feb. '07 and lost it in an accident July '08. It was quick and accelerated smoothly, performed well both on the city streets and on long trips. Very nice stereo system-great bass. Minor drawback is some of the paint chipped off the radio's on/off button and the knobs/buttons in general seemed a bit cheap. Mileage averaged approx. 19 in city and 23 highway. In these times of high gas prices, one might struggle between choosing this higher performing car versus a more efficient auto. I had my fun but have now concluded I must choose a more economical vehicle; however, I will never forget my Pontiac G6 GTP."
pontiac,g6,2006,brandi0521, 08/20/2008,A real lemon!,2,"I just had to have this car when it came out. I've had it now for just over 2 yrs. This car is a piece of crap. I bought a lemon. It has been in the shop 8 times for stabilitrak. The pontiac dealership never made claims against my warranty, so never fixed it. I've since gotten it fixed. But they were scared it was going to cause my brakes to go out. So now I've had to pay out of pocket for front and back brakes. I've purchased Extended Warranty. I now have a hole in my muffler that isn't covered on that. Yesterday I went to open my top and the back part opened and the top went up and fell back down. Lots of squeaks and rattles that the dealer can't fix. Truly a LEMON!"

To this point vehicle has been great and fun to drive. With only 201hp, this vehicle does have get up and go. The problem were the rotors, I guess Pontiac used cheap metal.   "

When this happens the braking is very sensitive,but shims(Shakes) right and left when braking.I have replace the front pads that seemed to help.  Still like my car though ..Drives great ,fuel efficiency is excellent in my opinion.  I plan to keep mine for awhile .."
pontiac,g6,2006,SnobZilla, 01/05/2008,"Looks like a coupe, drives beautifully!",4,"I bought this car thinking I'd be ""OK"" with it until I could afford my ""Audi"".  I'm not even thinking about the Audi anymore! Not for at least three or four years! It rides unbelievably well. . . it's more comfortable than our Jetta, too.  Gas mileage is not great in the city but using Shell gas vs. any other increased my gas mileage by 3 miles per gallon and I hit right about 20 whereas our Jetta gets just a few miles more.  I have zero complaints! The GTP package has an unbelievable sound system and before this car I dont think I ever pictured myself cruisin' around on 18's! Haha! I love it! (And yes, I've had nice cars so this is not a case of ""first new car"" giddies!) Get one!"
pontiac,g6,2006,disappointed, 06/15/2009,Do not buy a Pontiac G6,1,"I have not even had my G6 for a year and I have had at least 5 things go wrong.  About a month after I got the car, the air conditioning went out.  Then about 2 months later the power steering would lock up.  About 3 months after that I had the breaks fixed and at the same time the starter needed to be replaced.  Now, I have the car in getting fixed b/c of a loud noise and the engine light and reduced engine power light coming on.  This car has been the biggest nightmare and I am going to trade it as soon as I can!!!  "

After a few months and some rain I got in my car to go to work one morning and noticed my seat belt was soaking wet (due to leaky sunroof). A couple of months after that I had a terrible vibration when turning left and come to find out my steering column was almost about to snap into! How's that 4 safety? Also having some starter issues that no one seems be able to figure out. All in all I've had the leaks fixed 5 times, brand new steering column 2 times, and I guess one day I'll get in it and it won't start from the starter issues I'm having. All of my problems started from the get go and dont look like its getting any better.BAD CAR"
pontiac,g6,2006,chris, 08/11/2009,G6 is underated,4,This car has power good handling and comes with a sports car attitude... Ive had mine used for over a year now and i haven't had any major problems on it at all and i drive it hard. The only thing i think that gives this car a bad rap is the Pontiac logo on the front...
pontiac,g6,2006,G6-GT-Owner, 02/18/2010,"Great ""Sporty"" Car",4,"I've owned this car for 3 months, and I am very pleased with this car. I personally spent alot of time researching and test driving different cars and this is what I settled on. A foreign alternative to this car would cost me an additional $6,000, and none of them would have pleased me like the G6 Coupe. The performance is great for it's class. Passing cars is a breeze compared to my 00 Taurus. The front seat is very comfortable and has plenty of head/leg room for my 6'0"" frame. The remote start and heated seats are a MUST HAVE for this car. Granted this is not a sports car, even in the GT/GTP packages, but they definitely make for sporty, comfortable, and classy daily driver."
pontiac,g6,2006,Gary, 05/26/2010,Great on fuel,4,"Bought this car used with 66,000 miles on it. Averaging 33 mpg on the highway, average speed about 70 mph.  Plenty of power for a 4cyl.  Reliability? The jury is still out because I have only had the vehicle a short time but so far so good!"
pontiac,g6,2006,Gigi's Master, 04/29/2005,Panoramic Roof is a GREAT invention,4,"Gigi (my G6) and I have been crusing Central Jersey for 6 months and so far, I've loved every minute of it.  In my heart, I'm a convertible driver.  I feared that the panoramic roof wouldn't feed my need for wind.  The reality has been the reverse.  Due to the multiple settings, I've been able to open the roof at lower temperatures and get my fresh air fix.  I'm sure I'll have a bit of lust in my heart once Pontiac launches the G6 Convertible next year, but right now, I'm enjoying the cruise."
pontiac,g6,2006,intimid8tor3, 09/09/2005,GM is closing the Gap!!,5,"I've had my '06 GTP Coupe for 1600 miles now, and I love it. The 3.9L 240hp V-6 makes this car a blasat to drive. It let's you mess with cars costing a lot more. The gas mileage is good, around 22.0 mpg in mixed driving. The big 18"" tires provide plenty of grip, handling, and a good ride. Interior and exterior build quality is on par with more expensive German and Japanese models. I would recommend a look at this car to anyone who does not want to go broke, but does want to have a lot of fun in an every-day-driver. "
pontiac,g6,2006,Brian, 09/24/2005,Love it!,4,"I recently purchased the 06 G6 GTP sedan. I absolutely love it! The car is fast, the stereo is loud and the panoramic roof is excellent. TONS of room in the back to get my 5 year old in and out. If you have kids, and want performance this is definitely the way to go. Anyone who drives it absolutely loves it. Recommend to everyone. "
pontiac,g6,2006,Dave, 01/03/2006,G6 GTP 6 speed manual,4,"I just purchased a GTP Coupe w/a manual trany.  Love the car and the ride, not too crazy about the way the transmission shifts as it's a little notchy.  The car looks like a Accord and Solaria mated and the off spring took steroids.  I'm getting approx 23 mph in mixed driving.  I just figured out the sweet spot for mileage is between 1500 and 2000 rpm. 2000 rpm in 6th gear will get you 70 mph and 30++ mpg (red line is 6300 rpm).  The front seats have a lot headroom even with a sunroof, the headroom in the back is tight (I'm 6') for me but the wife fits fine."
pontiac,g6,2006,jimmy, 02/26/2006,My new toy,5,I purchaced a 2006 g6 GT in november of 2005 when they came out. I couldn't take not having the power i used to have in my grand prix GTP so i traded in the GT for the G6 GTP. It has been an eye-catching black sports coupe. i love everything about it!!
pontiac,g6,2006,JPF, 02/26/2006,Get the GTP if you can swing it.,4,Love my new G6 GTP.  So glad I did not buy a boring Japanese sedan.  Got all options except Onstar.  Hugs the road.  Lots of power.  Sweet exhaust note.  Panoramic roof is a must if you want air and sun without hassle of convertible. Nice stereo.  Fit and finish is excellent.      
pontiac,g6,2006,pmp, 04/09/2006,Pontiac GTP,4,"We love our new G6 GTP.  The car has lots of power and the exterior looks great, very sporty.  My neighbors can't believe it's a Pontiac. From the outside the car looks smaller than it really is.  In fact it is as big as the Camry and Accord, but you would never guess it due to the sleek low profile.  The best attribute of the GTP is the power and sporty ride.  Also love the panoramic sunroof which makes this 4 door sedan almost a convertable  This is no boring Camry, but it is also not as refined or quiet as the Toyota or Honda.  The interior has also been greatly upgraded, but again not to the standard of the Japanese.  If you want a sporty family sedan, the G6 GTP is a great choice."
pontiac,g6,2006,jrusa1, 07/11/2006,G6 GTP Sedan,4,"I'm two weeks into ownership.  After driving numerous ""sport"" sedans, this was the first one to really stir some emotion with me.  The engine has really nice pull, and the handling is great!  The car is not quite as nicely put together as some of the Japanese and German sedans I drove, but what it lacks in fit and finish perfection it makes up for in style and performance."
pontiac,g6,2006,Penny, 08/06/2006,I love this car!,4,"I had rented a G6 when traveling and fell in love with it then.  Now that I bought one of my own, it is even better than I imagine.  I haven't found anything about this car I don't like."
pontiac,g6,2006,fred ammirata, 08/08/2006,My Favorite Car,4,"I have only owned my G6 for a little over a month but I find myself looking for reasons just to drive it. I love the styling and it's handling. I think my only complaint is the ""blind spots"" in the rear. I really love the sound system, it's Monsoon 6 cd changer is great, and it's ""play list"" recorder is something I would never think of in a car. I have the panoramic moon roof and when it's open it like having a convertable.  I think American cars have improved by leaps and bounds over the last 10 years. All in all, I LOVE my G6 "
pontiac,g6,2006,rgebo5150, 12/08/2014,great little car,3,Just got my G6 and so far it's a good car.  Only problems I have so far is my stereo cuts out alot and it's just the front speakers that do this and the other is that if I'm going 55 mph my rpms are at 3000. Is anyone else seeing this or is it just my little 4 cylinder? That seems high and would get better gas mileage if it was lower.  Would love to hear if yours is the same way. 
pontiac,g6,2006,ADB, 09/29/2005,Better Than I Thought,5,"I have the 6-speed manual.  IMO, it's the only acceptable form of this car. The 3.9L is sufficiently powerful and the transmission has a wide spread of complementary ratios.  However, first gear seems a bit short.  You have to up-shift far earlier than one would expect.  Overall, this car is great.  Onstar, XM and the panaromic roof are neat gee-whiz features.  The ride is firm but in no way harsh.  The body is free of creaks and rattles (even the sunroof).  Fuel economy is at 29mpg right now, which is far higher than expected.  The clutch is smooth, if a bit long in travel.  The seats are comfortable, rear legroom is impressive, and all the controls are logically placed.   A well done car."
pontiac,g6,2006,lovedapontiac, 11/13/2005,"Not bad Pontiac, not bad",4,"Looked at numerous midsizers including the Camry and Accord.  While this is much better than the Camry, I think the Accord overall is a much better value. It had higher interior quality and materials, smaller panel gaps inside and out, a faster engine, better fuel economy, and more luxury amenities. However, I chose the G6 because of the low price.  It's got a lot of the basic features the Accord has since the price is a couple thousand cheaper.  Plus it has the cool big moonroof that opens up in panels."
pontiac,g6,2006,R & R, 11/23/2005,Domestic Switch,4,"I have been sceptical of American made cars.  The last 3 cars my wife and I have owned are a 2002 Acura TL, 2000 Audi A4 and my current car a Infiniti 2003 G35 coupe.  This car is fun to drive and the GTP options gave us the features that we are used to at a good price.  We were going to trade the TL in for a TSX, but this car loaded and with the good deal we received on the price all I can say is go Pontiac.  Lots of interior space and nice looks.  With the extended wheel base in handles well and I'm used to my G35.  Very happy so far... I hope we stay as happy with this vehicle as we are today!    "
pontiac,g6,2006,Craig, 02/12/2006,2006 Pontiac G6 GTP 6 Speed,4,"The GTP version is all about power and handling. The hydraulic steering and stiffer suspension give the car a sports car feel. The 6 speed feels similiar like a Trans Am. The leather seats are bolstered to keep you in place while cornering. The gas mileage is pretty good. I have averaged over 25 mpg in mixed driving. Love the 18"" wheels and the excellent brakes. This car has personality and that is something you don't get with an Accord or Camry.  "
pontiac,g6,2006,Gib, 02/16/2006,Love the Car - Hate the Quality,4,"I love the look and the Driving feel of this car. And I say this with a heavy heart...  AVOID this Car!!!  It has a major design flaw with the Windows, which Leak into the seat belt. As of 2/16/06 the part to fix is On National Back order and I am 41st on the list to get the part after not being able to drive the car for 28 days and counting. Pontiacs Response, Too BAd. Which is a shame..."
pontiac,g6,2006,MJ, 02/17/2006,Really impressive!,4,"I have a loaded auto GTP with panoramic roof. 1st let's talk styling. The GTP exterior and interior are sharp! The dual exhaust & 18"" wheels give the car a very diff look than its little brothers (a regular G6). The 2-tone leather seats and aluminum look trim look great. Seats are contoured, comfortable & supportive, but not as thick as European cars. Overall, very attractive and comfortable.  3.9L V6 is powerful and the car has good torque. Power off the line is good, but passing power at highway speeds even better. All this is a very quiet cage. GM has really reduced outside/road noise. Good steering. (only on GTP). Great brakes. Suspension not quite up to par of foriegn cars. "
pontiac,g6,2006,Margie, 04/26/2006,Sweet On My G6,4,"I couldn't have asked to purchase a better car!  After owning a GrandAm...this new G6 is just awesome!  There's lots of room, the car drives like a gem and the overall appearance is just sweet!"
pontiac,g6,2006,George P, 05/16/2006,2006 4DR GTP,4,"I traded in my oldsmobile with 236,000 miles and bought the G6 GTP. I love this car. it's sporty, has plenty of power and a very nice interior. I have people stop me on the road to ask about it. The panoramic roof is awesome gives the passengers in the rear seat an open roof. The leather bucket seats are sporty with the double colors. The handling of this car is great with the big 18 inch tires. The monsoon radio is loud and crisp which makes listening a good experience.I wish there was 8 days in a week to drive this sports car!"
pontiac,g6,2006,G6 GTP, 05/16/2006,g6 gtp,5,"Excellent power, fun to drive and room enough for the kids and all their stuff"
pontiac,g6,2006,pam, 08/12/2006,I love this car,4,"What sold me on this car was the hardtop convertable. It performs amazingly well for the price. It has great pick-up. I love the sporty look inside. It does look plasticy, vinyl inside the door instead of leather trim. But where they chose to cut corners in order to acheive the affordable price was right on.  It rides smoothly. The retractable top is so cool. The only thing I don't like about it is you have to hold the button in until it is complete, and the placement of the button is overhead by the map light. So you have to hold your hand up. It would be much more comfortable if the had it by the gear shift. And there is absolutely NO trunk space when the top is down, minimal when it is up"
pontiac,g6,2006,Greg Cox, 08/26/2006,Awsome pontiac,5,solid car that also has the sporty look for midsize car and has the performance to go with it.
pontiac,g6,2006,jen16, 08/28/2006,Take you $26K and buy something else!,3,"Very disappointed in this car. I had high hopes but they've been dashed. Car is plagued with leaks, poor fit and finish, and inferior materials. Auto transmission leaves much to be desired; has trouble finding gears and when it does it is anything but smooth. The only thing GM got right is the exterior styling. "
pontiac,g6,2006,mj1pate, 09/06/2006,a Pontiac convert,4,"Never before interested in Pontiacs, until this model series.  There is something interesting and refreshingly unPontiac about every aspect of the GTP GT (sedan).  Peformance, comfort, ergonomics and seductive appearance make this care a gem.  This car has the best of Italian and Japanese aesthetics. If I had been told that this was an 80's  Maserati compact GT replica, I'd have fallen for it.  This is the best looking 4 pass sports sedan made by either Ford or GM.  "
pontiac,g6,2006,Grant, 09/07/2006,Excellent car,4,"The 2006 Pontiac G6 GT is an excellent car.  I have had mine for 11 months, and have had absolutely no problems.  Gets good mileage for a mid-sized sedan.  It is also a really fun car to drive."
pontiac,g6,2006,joane, 09/19/2006,"Great car, horrible sunroof",4,"I love the G6, it's a beautiful well running car.  The wind noise in the panoramic sunroof is so bad that i would not buy it again.  It sounds as though the window is cracked.  There is no beauty or no amount of performance that makes up for the noise and water leaks in this sunroof.  Beware if you buy it, my experience is showing that General Motors doesn't want to work with the consumer on this problem.  "
pontiac,g6,2006,Sullivan, 10/01/2006,Awesome Car,5,"The G6 is amazing.  I have had my for a little over a month and I love everything about it.  The V6 engine has nice pick-up.  The 6 disc stereo and sound system is great.  The seats are comfortable, the back seat is really roomy.  It is just a really fun car to drive.  I have the regular sunroof (not the panoramic) and I love it, it has a net in the front of it as a sound buffer to keep a lot of sound out and its just wonderful!  If you do not have a G6 you are missing out!!! Very Satisfied Customer!!!!"
pontiac,g6,2006,J Williams, 10/31/2006,NIce Car,4,"I brought the Pontiac G6 in 9/06 after wanting a Nissan Altima.  I found that the G6 was a nice substitute.  If I had to choose now, I would choose the G6 over the Altima.  The car is very roomy and the design is very nice for an American made car. I love the interior lighting that lights in read and the computer messages.   "
pontiac,g6,2006,mary, 01/05/2007,tall person/ miss rear wheel performance,4,"excellent headroom and legroom; appreciate lumbar support and heated seats, standard sun roof not exciting- would have loved hardtop conv.; good pick up/ acceleration; would have preferred tighter steering; disappointed with gas mileage (16.9 city with 3.9 v6) awkward to reach through driver's window."
pontiac,g6,2006,Kim, 01/08/2007,Love my Pontiac!,4,"I really shopped around before I chose the G6.  I had it narrowed down to the G6 and the Dodge Charger but when I st in the G6 GTP, I knew it was the car for me.   I have been driving this car for almost a year now and it a joy to drive.  It was the best buy for the money in its class.  I purchased the panoramic roof which I highly recommend.  I was going to go with the regular sunroof until I sat in one with the panoramic and it's like being in a convertible but better.   Overall, great car and incredibly satisfied with my purchase!"
pontiac,g6,2006,wrestleman125, 01/11/2007,Overall Nice Car,4,"This car is nice, fun to drive, and very reliable.  I have had my G6 for 1 year now and have about 11,000 miles on it and have had absolutely no problems at all.  My wife owns a Camry and likes to drive the G6 more then her vehicle.  Also if you live somewhere cold I advise you to cough up the couple of dollars and get the remote start... it's fantastic."
pontiac,g6,2006,QUARTlow, 02/15/2007,G6 GTP really rocks!!!,4,"I didn't expect to be able to buy this much car, and at such a good price.  I am in heaven!"
pontiac,g6,2006,norton, 03/22/2007,From Toyota to Pontiac,4,"After owning Toyotas for 35 years, I finally bought a new US auto. 06' GTP with the 3.9L engine. At the dealership I had no intention of buying a new car as I was there only to pick up the company vehicle. But there it was. $5k off red tag, $1k incentive + $1k off for owning a Toyota.$22k with all the options that I think that you can get. The last time that I had this much fun was  when I bought my 04' Roadster. Gas mileage may be lower then expected, but what price can you put on fun. The 3.9L is snappy and the car handles well. If there was one thing that I don't like, might be that the exhaust could be a bit more throaty like the GTO."
pontiac,g6,2006,JamiLuvsHerG6, 04/05/2007,I Love This Car!,4,"I love my G6! When I had went looking for cars I was looking for something sporty, but without the gas mileage of a sports car. I got exactly that with the G6 GTP. It has a lot of pickup and go. The sunroof is awesome for nice weather and the sound system is out of this world. The mileage is OK. I would like a little more, but the other benefits outweigh that by far."
pontiac,g6,2006,drwgaliv, 04/30/2007,What a Great Car!,5,"I have the 2006 GT fully loaded 4 dr. I started out with the basic V6 Sedan and I had already knew that I wanted the GT, but unfortunately at the time I couldn't afford it. So now I have the GT, and I absoulutely love it!  It drives beautifully, I love the shifter option when I need to pass someone. The Crimson Red color, with the panoramic roof really get's people to turn there heads. I get so many looks when it's just washed and detailed.  If you decided to get this vehicle, get the remote start, what a great feature on this vehicle. I have had many a cold nights, and hot days that this has been a wonderful option that I have."
pontiac,g6,2006,Jim Anderson, 07/28/2007,Pontiac G6 v6,5,"On a trip up north in May. I was getting mileage of 36.6 miles per gallon on I 95 driving at a speed between 70 and 75 miles per hour, handling was excelent and steady with cruise activated. Car was comfortable and seats were firm but not too firm. The whole trip of 2800 miles the gas mileage was 31.7 miles per gallon which included many miles of city driving after we arrived in NJ."
pontiac,g6,2006,manualgtp, 09/04/2007,Poor Reliability Ruins A Great Car,3,"The G6 is the right size and fun to drive. Gas mileage is above average. Reliability is a major problem: Brakes,rough idle, spark knock, Frequent engine light and airbag light issues, Front suspension parts wearing out early etc. Add that the dealer only provides a temporary fix, so you have to take it back again and again for the same problem. I have lost count of how many times it has been in for warranty work. I know it is over 14 times in less than 2 years. If it was reliable, it would be a great car. Maybe the base cars are better. This GTP has not. I have owned many new Pontiacs and this G6 has been the worst for repairs. Choose the Grand Prix instead. It appears to be more reliable."
pontiac,g6,2006,Jon, 04/05/2008,Best GM car I ever owned,4,"Love this car, bought it new and have 70k miles. I live in the country with dirt and rocky roads.  Has decent ground clearance for a care that is pretty sporty.  For a performance car it gets between 24 and 26 MPG depending on how heavy my foot is. Torque steer is a little much when you put your foot into it(I know this is a problem with front wheel drive car's). Have had very few problems. "
pontiac,g6,2006,Carly S., 09/01/2017,"208,000 miles.",4,"I am the 3rd owner of my GTP with 208,000 miles. There is a reason you always see G6's on the road... they are great cars. Transmission replaced at 140,000. Lots and lots of suspension replaced. But I'm in Minnesota and potholes and rust are our thing. Luckily I do a good chunk of the mechanic work myself, the car is so easy to work on. I have a small oil leak coming out of head gasket ($1400 fix). Disappointing, but she's been around. The interior of these cars (GTP Model, that is) is absolutely immaculate. The leather heated seats and BOSE sound system makes you feel like you're in a Lexus. This car is my absolute baby.
"
pontiac,g6,2006,Brian , 12/04/2009,No wonder they stopped making pontiacs,4,"I brought my car to the dealership to get 4 things done.  Oil change, replace windshield, fix my back seat b/c it wasn't going down, and fix my break lights.  My break lights were reversed.  They would always be on and when I hit the breaks they would go off.  Really safe.  They had my car for over a week and didn't give me a rental.  When I got it back 2/4 things were done.  They forgot to replace the windshield and never fixed the back seat.  A couple months later, the break lights reversed again.  I'm a school teacher and if 25% of my students were passing I'd be fired.   "
pontiac,g6,2006,Chupa Cabra, 12/25/2009,2006 G6,3,"I really give the car a lot of credit.  My wife runs the hell out of that thing and I just maintain it with the standard maintenance items that I normally do.  Oil change, filter, air filter, check tire pressure.  Have not checked plugs yet.  More than likely they are fine.  I believe there are iridium in there and there is not enough miles on it to worry about it.  The only thing I get a little scared about is the car likes to continue to try to start after you turn the key to the starting position.  Really bizarre.  I personally don't like the rear window pillars.  I cannot see anything when I go to switch lanes.  So take your time switching lanes. ake sure it is clear."
pontiac,g6,2006,HxaX, 07/03/2010,My first REAL car,4,"If you're looking for a great performance, fully loaded car for around $10,000, this is your car.  I'm only 20 years old and purchased this car a few weeks ago and so far it has driven great!  I love all the features.. the huge sunroof is great to show off.  The performance of the car STOCK is very smooth and very fast. And the stereo system is one to keep stock.   

Most guys my age are looking for cars like this, it's too bad there paying around 20k - 30k for them.  I paid $10k for this fully loaded beauty!  The one downside is the gas mileage.  I get around 17 - 19 mpg city and 18 - 22 highway.. Which isn't too bad considering I'm on 20 inch tires. But it's worth it for this ride!  "
pontiac,g6,2006,John, 04/28/2006,A Bit Concerned,3,"I took delivery of my 2006 GT Coupe about six weeks ago, but it didn't take more than a few days for me to recognize some design flaws: cheap, manual seat recliner, no heated side mirrors, can't close sunroof by one- touch, no rear window wiper, akward cup holders, awkward head rests, speakers vibrate with bass. I have to admit, I bought this car on impulse. I walked in to take a peek at the Solstice and fell in 'lust' with the G6 coupe. Three hours later I drove it out of the showroom. Looking back I would not have bought this car (got lucky with this approach when I bought my Z3, so gave it another try!!). Now there is an interior leak that is causing the interior sidewall to collapse!! UGH"
pontiac,g6,2006,GiGi, 06/12/2006,Lovin my G6 Hardtop convertible,4,"Picked up my car on 5/01/06 had been awaiting its arrival since February 2006. I can truly say,""I'm loving It"". We took it to the mountains in Pennsylvania and to the shore on Long Island. It drives nice, has good Pick up, handles well and drives smooth. The top pops up or down in app 30 seconds and it's beautiful to look at!!!!!! Pontiac did a very good job. I almost broght a toyota but I am  SO...Happy that I waited until pontiac perfected the G6! It was definitely worth the wait!!!!!!!!!!!"
pontiac,g6,2006,Billy, 10/28/2006,Gas Mileage,3,Decent Transportation - do not go out of your way to seek out this car.  I got some really great incentives so I bought it. The gas mileage is not up to what the sticker says.   The automatic MPG on the dash board is about 2 miles more than what I calculate myself.  I have the 6 cylinder.  I recommend that you go for the 4 cylinder to improve gas mileage. Very small glove compartment. This is my first Pontiac.
pontiac,g6,2006,Rob, 11/07/2006,"""Simply awesome""",5,"I must say this car is ""AWESOME"" I traded my 2007 Toyota Camry for an American car??  What a great decision I am very happy with this vehicle.  My 2007 Toyota they say is a great car I disagree I nothing but problems with my Toyota since the second day I owed it so who really says that Japan makes a better vehicle???  Not me!!!!!  I think GM is and has come a long way and I am proud to own American once again!!!!  GREAT JOB GM, I promise I won't ever leave you again!!!!!"
pontiac,g6,2006,CJ, 01/03/2007,Sunroof Leaks,3,The car has been back to the dealer several times for Sunroof Leaks. They claim the drain hose comes off and the water runs down the drivers side wall and soaks the seat belt retractor. Have had two dealers attempt to fix it several times each. Contacted Pontiac. Still fighting the battle.
pontiac,g6,2006,dnikole, 11/14/2013,2006 Pontiac g6 GT,2,"My mother bought this car in 2008 I believe, and gave it to me about 2 years ago for better mpg. It was perfectly fine never had a problem. Then everything started to go wrong. The passenger headlight went out, the CD player stopped ejecting the CDs, the brakes squeak no matter what, I've already tried to fix it multiple times, and my power steering just recently went out almost caused me to wreck, scared the living daylights out of me. I didn't even have all these problems with my 87' IROC. "
pontiac,g6,2006,Ms. Farmer, 09/16/2008,Piece of Trash,2,"I leased my G6 GTP in 2006 and the lease will end 2010 and I can't wait. I had the car in at the dealership many times on the sunroof, cd changer, blower, brakes, rotors, power steering pump, and now a gear shift controller. All of that has been replaced, but now the I can't get car out of park, after the dealership put in a new gear shift! This is definitely a lemon, and don't want to ever purchase another GM product. Cute body style, but its a piece of trash. Hurry up Jan 10, so I can take this mess back since that is when my lease ends. GM need to stop making this car and to get better parts so this car can be reliable, because it's not! Shame on you GM!"
pontiac,g6,2006,mel1105, 07/12/2012,Please do not waste your money,2,"I have owned this car for 3.5 years now and have dumped over $3,000 in repairs in the last 24 months into it with replacing wheel bearings, strut mounts, brake pads & rotors, calipers etc etc etc.

I wish I had someone warn me prior to purchase on the money pit this car actually is.
Please take note of this if you are considering."
pontiac,g6,2006,Jake, 01/06/2007,The Nice Pontiac,4,"Well, my mom had to go to Chattanooga. So, we had to rent a car. So, it was a choice to rent a brand new Kia Optima or a Pontiac G6. So, I chose the Pontiac G6. But, when we drove off onto the freeway I saw my mom was going 100 mph! But, the car was in kph! We did not live in London or anything related to that. So, we had to drive like this the whole way to Chattanooga. It was too late now because we were already on the way to Chattanooga. But, we managed to get to Chattanooga safely."
pontiac,g6,2006,Cyle, 06/16/2008,Worst Car I Ever Owned,1,"I have owned this car since they came out.  The first time I got into the car the check engine light was on, right their I should have stopped from buying the car. The 4 speed transmission is a huge let down, the power is their but not when you need it. The interior is cheap, the fabric stains easily. The paint on the front bumper pits easily from stones,etc.  The doors are huge and heavy, heavier than a truck door. In GM's attempt to get a better looking car into the market than the Cobalt they have failed on a massive level. Overall this car is better in the junkyard than on the road!"
pontiac,g6,2006,Bob, 07/23/2008,Worst Car Pontiac Has Ever Made,2,"The car is an all around piece of junk!  The styling is ok but could improve in some areas.  The paint is way to thin and chips easily on the front bumper.  The transmission is junk, GM made a huge mistake by mating a 4 speed automatic to a 3.5L V6 because the gear ratios are too far apart and the power and response are not their when you need it.  The cruise control lacks a good base, the car may drift + or - 5 mph before the car decides it want to accelerate.  The interior is not much to be desired, the seats are not comfortable, the dash ugly and the radio can not be replaced. Overall the car is a HUGE waste of money, I am very disappointed!"
pontiac,g6,2006,Disappointted, 02/09/2009,Never Again,2,"I've had more problems with this car in the last two years than any other vehicle I've owned.It shakes when I try to stop, it makes clunking noises when i turn, it continues to crank after already crunk, cuts off, water in the head light, pins in the sunroof keeps slipping out, brakes issues, and many more issues.I will not ever buy another Pontiac.Very poor quality vechile. Some issues not covered under warranty even though so many are having the same issue. Great customer right.. NOT."
pontiac,g6,2006,ddd017, 05/07/2009,Don't Make Our Mistake,2,"Ugh. We wanted to buy American but the G6 2-door convertible is a mistake we will not make again. We have not even finished paying off the 3-year loan and can't wait to get rid of it! Just had the entire exhaust system replaced ($1200!), we've had 3 flat tires (driver side back tire) and numerous trips for the rattles. Horrible in snow, no tractionIt takes FOREVER to retract the hardtop & you lose the trunk if the top is down. The lower dash/glove compartment areas shows every little mark if you brush up against it. Horrible trying to get into the back seats. ""Terrable, terrable, terrable"" as Charles Barkley would say. DON'T make our mistake - RUN, RUN as fast as you can AWAY from this car."
pontiac,g6,2006,Marcel, 01/12/2010,review and corrections,4,"Nice car. Rather heavy, but that doesn't seem to bother the 3.9 engine. O correction to the reviewer who listed horror when the vehicle continued to crank after the key was let go because the system incorporates an electronic monitoring of the cranking system. It is designed to continue cranking after the key is let go until either 10 seconds elapses or the engine starts. Overall, the car has had a few major issues. Front Brakes continue to warp despite 4 rotor replacements and new pads. Radiator Leakage Steering column (popping) (known issue) Smaller issues are: radio keeping flipping between radio and CD on its own (usually when the radio signal call sign has a '*' next to it"
pontiac,g6,2006,Lisa, 02/04/2008,Nice car but disappointed in performance,3,Love the looks and comfort of this car. Handles pretty well accept does not do well in the snow. I've had other front wheel drive cars do much better. Rides smooth. A little disappointed in the gas mileage. Didn't get what was quoted. I have had my car for 6 months and am working on trading it already. I need one with better traction in the snow.
pontiac,g6,2006,The MAN, 06/14/2005,GREAT Car,5,"Great ride, very smooth and nice looking.   Plenty of power, who needs 400 horsepower any way. I would recommend this car to anyone.  Had 2003 Honda Accord and the G6 is much better.  Better quality and smoother ride.   Handling is great.   "
pontiac,g6,2006,Sportscarnut, 06/24/2005,Pretty Strong For The Money,4,"This is my company car, and I have only had it for a month, but here are my first impressions.  The engine is strong (especially above 4000 RPM), and the transmission is the best 4 speed automatic I have ever driven.  The ride is reasonably firm for a domestic while not being overly harsh.  The interior room is very good for a car in this class, and the exterior styling is fine if not a tad subdued.  My only real complaint is the quality of the interior pieces.  The door panels and the console are made of inferior quality plastic.  It looks like something you would expect to find on a Yugo (pretty bad).  Made sure to poke around at the interior before you buy.  It is way under Honda/Toyota."
pontiac,g6,2006,ToddV, 10/09/2005,Like riding on a cloud...,5,"Wow, what a car!! I love my GTP G6 Coupe!! It rides so smooth and quiet and handles like a dream. The 240 hp along with the 18 inch wheels makes for a fun ride. I've received many positive comments from complete strangers..always makes ya feel good doesn't it? "
pontiac,g6,2006,tech boy, 10/24/2005,a fabulous ride,5,"I never expected so much performance from a vehicle in this price range. Especially not from a non import. It feels like an Acura or a BMW - at 1/2 the price. These cars are going to go up in price as this ""secret"" becomes common knowledge."
pontiac,g6,2006,Frank, 03/24/2006,Stylish and Practical,4,"The 3.5 V6 engine provides plenty of power and the coupe is very quick at all speeds.  Although the G6 uses a 4- speed transmission, gas mileage is pretty good.  The G6 ride is firm and responsive, but there is a moderate amount of road noise.  The interior is much improved over previous models, but still not perfect.  The chrome outlined dash layout and controls are very nice, but there is way too much hard plastic that gives a cheap feel.  Especially the steering wheel.  It is hard, uncomfortable and will slip in your hands.  The cup holders are put where drinks will restrict your driving. Overall, a well equipped and stylish vehicle for the money.  Would recommend."
pontiac,g6,2006,BG, 04/26/2006,I do not like the G6,2,"I traded in my 2003 Grand Am GT w/ ram air in for this car and I'm very upset that I chose the G6. It does not have enough power, hesitates when the gas pedal is pushed, there are blind spots everywhere on the car and the car has a horrible turning radius. I got the G6 V6 for a reasonable lease price but I am definitely not happy with this car."
pontiac,g6,2006,Theresa, 07/08/2006,new 06,3,I have only had my 2006 pontiac G6 for a month so still working out some things but its very comfortable and fun to drive rides well have not taken a trip yet. but around here getting 25.6 miles to gal which is nice. there are blind spots but really like back windows that go all the way down.

pontiac,g6,2006,Harry, 09/07/2006,Great Car,4,I recently purchased my GTP and have put a ton a miles on it.  It has been very reliable and a TRILL to drive.  It hugs curves extremely well and can get to 100 mph in a flash.  I test drove many cars in the GTP price range and this was by far the best.  I would recommend this car to anyone.
pontiac,g6,2006,dmo4cwo, 09/11/2006,G6 GTP,4,"Approx 3k miles as of Aug 2006. At 300 miles, had oil leak. Dealer replaced rear engine seal. Multiple paint issues. Black paint did not cover primer and was very transparent on deck lid. Paint is very thin on this vehicle.

To this date everything is absolutely great with the car.  I finally got the ""Panormaic"" sun roof fixed from the continual creaking.  But, I did the repairs myself in my driveway.  Not a good score for GM Service Techs.  It went in twice for the same creaking noise and came out as it went in.  No, I was not a happy camper.  I fixed the problem using cork stripping under the support brackets to the sunroof over the visors.  1 hr 30 minutes later it was fixed and I've heard no creaking to date.  Anyway, just a little FYI to those having this problem."

I have have brake problems as well, the rotors got warped within the first 2 weeks and they squeak all the time.  I am very unhappy and am trading in for a Corolla S.  GM should stick to what they know, trucks!"
pontiac,g6,2006,Erin, 06/10/2008,Do not buy,2,"My bought my G6 based on my husband's friend who loved his. I test drove mine and loved it. Two week later the problems began. In the two years I have had it the whole front end has been replaced (steering rack, steering column, struts, brakes, tires, some kind of suspension links and clear coat just to name a few) and still can not find the problem. I could not take it anymore I finally traded it in for my Jeep. Save your money and the problems."
pontiac,g6,2006,jen, 07/09/2008,"Love it, but Hate it as well...",2,"Purchased a red one, with a 6 speed, so it has the power I like and looks great. But within days of owning they needed it back for a recall to fix the sunroof. Then a couple months later I had a waterfall in the car. Sunroof is very loud when closed. Then the lock broke off. I had to get the rotors rotated at 20,000 miles. Will this cause more issues later? A sensor in the door must be going bad that sends the signal saying it is open or shut. The window is suppose to drop down when open & move up when closed. It moves back up before being closed & makes a horrible noise. Afraid it will break the glass. Also the radio doesn't always go off when the door is open."
pontiac,g6,2006,psp711, 07/16/2008,A great combination,4,"I hadn't owned a Pontiac in years, but had some wonderful GM products in the past.  This sporty, roomy car offers me the best of all worlds.  The quiet of a hard top.  The joy and sportiness of a convertible.  The comfort and space of a luxurious automobile.  And ECONOMY!  I honestly get 20-22 mpg driving around town in stop and go driving.  And on the highway I can count on 32 mpg.  This is as good as many mini cars--and I'm surrounded by all this luxury and convenience.  This car has been a joy to drive, has plenty of power and people often stop me to ask me what kind of car it is--especially when the top is down.  Great car, have had no problems and economical too."
pontiac,g6,2006,blaine, 07/19/2008,Mediocre GM build,3,"I was impressed by initial style, comfort, and fuel economy. Soon discovered its limitations.  V6 is a bit noisy and seems unrefined. Suspension is loose. The car wants to jump out of your hands- when you accelerate (I mean step on it)  it pulls to one side.  Before our 36,000 mile anniversary we started having popping sounds coming from front suspension (especially while turning corners), even with a tire rotation/balance routine and alignment, the tires had cupped out, and rotors warped. Bye-bye G6   After 18 months together Ill miss your roomy comfortable cabin and leg room.  Will not miss your little trunk opening- awkward for large items. "
pontiac,g6,2006,Total Junk, 08/12/2008,Plan on Spending Time in the Shop,1,Shortly after purchasing this vehicle 20k miles I noticed a spring sound coming from the front passenger wheel. Turned out to be a strut problem.  30k miles replaced the driver's side strut and then had to replace the entire front suspension.  Now at 52k it is doing it all again.  The interior door molding is pulling away from the door.  Now I also think the the bearings are bad in the front passenger wheel because the tire sounds like an airplane engine taking off and landing as I reduce speed. This vehicle has been nothing but problems and would not recommend a G6 or any other GM product to anyone that I valued as a friend.  I've replaced my rotors at least 6 times as well.  
pontiac,g6,2006,notso, 08/24/2008,3 yrs and I hate the car,3,"I have had this car for 3 yrs now and have had the rotors front and back replaced twice each, and my brakes replaced 10 times.A leak in the sunroof, motor blower replaced, turn signal bulb burnt out, and the driver's mirror cover broke. I have had Chevys and Fords in the past and never had problems like this."
pontiac,g6,2006,LA, 09/06/2008,One of My Biggest Mistakes!,3,"I bought my car and not even two months later, ""engine power reduced"" appears after my engine light comes on. My engine power is reduced and I am at risk of getting hit on the highway and has to turn my car off just to get it going again. After $900, 7 times in the shop and not being able to drive it 9 out of 11 months, I still have the same problem.  I have no more money to spend on it and after making my payments on it monthly for 12 months, I have stopped.  I can't even trade it in because I owe too much on a piece of crap!  It is about to ruin my credit by going back. WHAT A JOKE!! Never again will I buy from Budget Car Sales nor will I own a Pontiac. So sad."
pontiac,g6,2006,JennyA, 09/05/2008,My G6 - A lot like others...,3,"I do love this car.  But I'm frustrated to no end with General Motors and their lack of responsibility.  There is a major, widespread problem with this car's steering shaft and power steering.  Even under warranty, GM doesn't want to replace a part more than once; and, even if they did, it would just brake again because the parts are faulty.  And nobody seems to care that steering troubles are major safety issues.  I am currently very uncomfortable driving this vehicle. And anyone in my path should be scared, too.  GM seems to think it's fine with the steering wheel popping every time I turn.  And they're not concerned that most of these cars have a failing power steering system.  Beware!"
pontiac,g6,2006,darchey, 09/10/2008,Awesome Car,4," I love the exterior, it is so pretty.  I have a silver G6 Gt and it has chrome wheels and tinted windows making this car look so stylish on the road.  I really love the look"
pontiac,g6,2006,Not Happy, 09/10/2008,Let Down,3,"When I first saw the G6 I just loved the looks of it.  After test driving one I decided to buy it. I have only had my car for nine months and I am very disappointed.  I have had problems with rotors, breaks, turn signal burn out, passenger mirror cover breaking, CD player quit working, knocking sounds every time I turn left or right, squeaking sounds, and just today rattling sounds every time I step down on my gas pedal!  I had this car in for service four times they say they fix it, but it just starts all over again. My warranty has expired I just want to get rid of it but I owe more than I have paid on it, so I think I'm going to be stuck with my G6 lemon for sometime yet!"
pontiac,g6,2006,oneasante, 12/20/2007,So Far So Great.,4,"After driving a 98 malibu for a brief minute....literally, I gave GM one more chance especially for the affordability. The G6 is a great comeback! Once you get past the initial annoying defects (rack n pinion, paper brakes, and front wheel bearing) you have a car that floats at 80mph yet feels sturdy and reliable. I pray it stays this way! "
pontiac,g6,2006,Jaybaby727, 10/03/2008,If only I had known.,3,"I am so disappointed to see that I have all of the exact same problems that the folks here have had with their G6 4dr Sedan. I thought I was getting a really awesome car when I bought it over a year ago. NOT SO.  Steering wheel pops& is hard to control (wobbles) brakes (front AND back) have been replaced, rotors, tie rod ends. YOU NAME IT, it's gone bad! I'm unable to trade it in because of the loss of value and I am sickened to think that I am stuck with this for at least another year. It's at the dealership NOW being evaluated - probably for naught, because I thought (stupidly) that after having all this work done at my local tire shop, THEY were the wrong ones. Now I see it's GM!"
pontiac,g6,2006,jandkds, 11/01/2008,My G6 Lemon,3,"I bought my G6 a little over a year ago and was very happy with it even though it had some odd noises. Now if you try to accelerate the engine cuts out and the light comes on. Almost killed when engine cut out while passing someone. Dangerous! Has been in the shop 5 times for the issue (and others) told it just isn't meant to accelerate? (what, no highway driving or passing?) I don't believe it. I am ready to voluntarily have it reposessed and ruin my credit. I now officially hate this death trap. Whats up GM, why no recalls on the faulty computer?"
pontiac,g6,2006,Jack Hoffman, 11/03/2008,Pile of junk,3,"This is by far the worst car I've ever owned. Bought with 16,000 miles on it, I had problems from day one. Sun visors fell off, 3 CD players, rack & pinion, 2 wheel bearings, several rotors, tie rod end, steering coupler. Now at 56,000 miles, the struts are gone and a loud clunk in the front end again. Check engine light on again. I will never buy another GM product again nor will I recommend it to anyone. Thank goodness it leaves next year. Before I buy another car, I will make sure to check this website out."
pontiac,g6,2006,JennyB, 11/05/2008,"Very disappointed, but relieved",4,"I have just hit my two years of owning my 2006 G6 Sedan and I have already put $1000+ into the car. After reading the other reviews, I'm so sad to hear that others are having the same troubles. Two months after owning the vehicle, I was told by the dealership during an oil change, that the front struts were leaking and that my steering shaft needed to be lubed due to a clunking sound. A year into owning the car, I have had my brakes, rotors, blinker bulbs and front struts replaced. I am about to have my right front wheel bearing replaced this week. Just a note of advice if you hear a tingy sound while driving with the windows down, it could possibly be a clamp loose on the muffler."
pontiac,g6,2006,Jae, 11/12/2008,Same problems,2,"I have had my car going on 2 years, and the major thing I have replaced are thee rotors. However, I do hear an popping noise whenever I am turning the steering wheel, and this happened just a couple of months after purchasing it. My car does tend to shake when stopping, I hope its not the tire rod end. The interior paint is already fading. I do like the acceleration of the vehicle, the style, and the appearance. I just wish GM had put more thought into the other qualities of the vehicle."
pontiac,g6,2006,cnfusd1, 11/14/2008,Wouldn't suggest,3,"I've had more problems with this car in two years than any other vehicle I've owned. It has left me stranded on the highway twice. Do not like the 17"" low profile tires that cost more to replace than my truck tires do. With only 24,000 miles I've spent over $2500 keeping this car on the road. It's comfortable and roomy but that is all that this car has going for it. It's not the economy making GM go under. It's GM's inferior products. I'm looking at trading it in before it leaves me stranded once again."
pontiac,g6,2006,annette, 11/21/2008,More bad reviews for G6,3,I too have replaced the rotor and brakes on my car. I cannot believe I have spent so much money on this car. My air compressor went out and I lost control of my car. I am so frustrated with this car. I cannot wait to get rid of it. I havent purchased anything but GMC. I have always been loyal but now I question where is their loyalty? I am out money.
pontiac,g6,2006,michael, 11/26/2008,Love this GTP,4,"Have had this car 2.5 years, ordered it to my tastes and I love it. Have not had a days worth of trouble. Love the 6 speed manual, it really goes. Decent in the snow. The heated seats are awesome in the winter. Cavernous room for my two teenage boys in the back seats and all my friends think this car looks hot. Maybe because it`s in my favorite flavor-red. Sound system is sweet, tho it could use some automatic sound leveling and a mute button, but why be picky. I am deploying to Iraq next summer and I am thinking I may sell it and get a new one, but I love the 6 speed manual that isn`t made anymore, not sure I can bring myself to let it go. Might let the wife go before the car."
pontiac,g6,2006,scott, 12/15/2008,My mistake,3,"My mistake for buying a Pontiac G6. Clunking noise in front, had to replace front and back brakes and rotors. Leaking sun roof. After reading other reviews I think this will be my last Pontiac. And to think they used to be good. Bye bye Pontiac."
pontiac,g6,2006,skpalmer, 12/18/2008,Terrible G6!,1,"I am with all the other G6 owners out there have the love hate relationship with their G6. I have had so many problems with my car, we had to buy a separate car that was more dependable just to make sure we'd have a car to drive. Now just another problem to add to the list, tonight we started driving 55-60 mph and the stupid thing starts shaking so much that your voice shakes if you try and talk! Love the looks but hate the car! Never buying a Pontiac again, I had 02 Grand Prix and loved it so much I got this. Pontiac really messed up when they built this car!"
pontiac,g6,2006,L.A., 12/26/2008,Why did I Settle?,4,"Reading what's on here made me cry. It really is a death trap. I have a 2006 Pontiac G6. I didn't have it two months before Engine Power Reduced popped up. I can be on the highway going 60 and my speed will reduce to 35. I won't even be able to pull a hill. I thank God I didn't get in a wreck because of this car. I tried all I can. I don't have any more money to spend on parts that don't help the problem. I can't talk to the people at GM any more. I can't call lawyer any more. I tried giving the car back. I tried turning it in to be repo.  But, I will still have to pay remaining balance after they resale the car. I hate this. Paying for a car for 16 months that I can't drive. cant be fixed"
pontiac,g6,2006,Tbird, 12/29/2008,Still on the fence,4,I bought this car a little over 2 1/2 yrs ago. When I first got it I loved it but since I have had some reservations. The car is hard to manuver in tight spaces. It's almost as if the wheel is locking or it gives the impression that there is no power steering fluid in the vehicle. I have replaced the windshield 2 times and I've had problems with it starting and no one can seem to tell me why it wouldn't start. It's running great now and I want to believe that every thing will be just fine in '09.
pontiac,g6,2006,Crazy_lady955, 01/08/2009,Very Dissappointed in this car!,2,"This car is a piece of junk! The steering rack has broken twice, the passenger window slams down when you do the auto down, now the check engine light is on and I get this message check gas cap. One time my gas cap was off completely. I wish I had never got this thing. And god knows how many more problems we are going to have I'm nervous I don't have the money to replace all the crap that is going wrong with this. This car must be made in China, and the driver side seat heater is broken for some reason. I'm disappointed."
pontiac,g6,2006,Pedro Mendes, 01/15/2009,GM ... Never again,4,"I've had my car for three years. While I love the look and style of the car, I'm extremely disapointed in the quality. So far I've replaced or repaired the following  : Jan 06 - New Struts R&L Apr 06 - New hubs & alignment Jul 06 - Rattle in head liner Oct 06 - Machined rotors Nov 06 - Water in head light Jan 07 - Replaced handle on seat and repaired rattle in trunk May 07 - New transmission (6 spd) Jun 07 - New front brakes (After market) Oct 07 - New steering colunm and inserted foam behind surge tank. Jan 08 - New windshield wiper motor Aug 08 - New driver side window switch Sep 08 - Transmission mount replaced (broken) Jan 09 - New bearing in clutch  Warrenty ... pheww"
pontiac,g6,2006,audra, 01/21/2009,I loved this car,3,"I bought this car used last year. Everything was good until I went to make a sharp turn and the steering locked up. It acted like I had no powersteering fluid. Still acts up off and on. My gear shift is hard to adjust, acts like its trying to stick. I can't get my key out of the ignition sometimes. It acts like it's stuck in there. I sat in my car for over 5 min trying to get it out. My ""ice possible"" light keeps flashing when the temps aren't even close to being freezing. My ""time, temp, language"" keeps resetting itself. My fuel range is unreliable. This car is going crazy and so am I trying to figure out what it's doing. Love the look, color, handle and style. Won't buy another though."
pontiac,g6,2006,bob i, 01/26/2009,Front suspension noise,2,"Have had the car 2 years. It has 27,000 mostly highway miles. When the weather gets cold, the suspension sounds like its coming apart. Had the car to the dealership 6 times for front suspension. Have changed intermediate shaft 2x, steering column 2x, struts once, and strut bearing caps once. Can't say they are not trying to fix it, but I am beginining to belive that Pontiac has a design defect in its front suspension. Have heard too many other horror stories about the same problem. I can now understand why GM is in trouble! "
pontiac,g6,2006,Lora, 01/31/2009,Disappointment,3,"I bought my car new, and have had nothing but problems.  I consider myself an above average driver, as I put a lot of care into my cars.  However, in the 3 years that I have had it I have replaced the following: CD player, front windshield, cruise control, steering column, head unit (#2 cylinder was misfiring), and now I have to replace the converter.  What's next?  I am never buying Pontiac again!!"
pontiac,g6,2006,electrified1, 02/08/2009,No Help at Dealer - Under Warranty,2,"The 6 speed manual tranny is a blast to drive. Gear ratios are perfect, especially in stop and go traffic. I can make u-turns going over 25mph.   The dealer has tried to fix my leaking sunroof 3 times. They have turned my brake rotors 5 times. the motor mounts make a horrible noise.  power steering groans in cold weather. Airbag light just came on. I am out of warranty and now had to fix my sunroof, brakes, engine mount myself.  I would call it a piece of junk but if the dealer had fixed it the first time.... it would have been the best car I have ever had.  "
pontiac,g6,2006,Blair, 02/15/2009,C'mon Pontiac,3,I've my car for about 10 months and have had many problems with it. A month after having it my car started dying even thought a month earlier a new battery was put in. I ended having to buy a new battery for it. Then in 11/08 the car started making noises. Every time I would accelerate or turn my car to the left. It sounded as if the suspension was about to come apart as still does it today. 5 days ago when I was driving the engine light was lit up and the engine pow reduced light also came up. My MPG reduced from 40 to 15 and my car eventually stalled. I took it into the shop and had it fixed. I drove it home and did it again and is now sitting in my drive way while I figure out what to do
pontiac,g6,2006,okcar, 02/22/2009,Pretty good value,4,"I have 85k miles on this car (bought with 27k)and have replaced only ""wear"" parts, such as brake pads and tires.  The replacement of the original battery did seem a little early.  No mechanical problems and gets pretty good gas mileage ~27 with more highway driving.  OK in snow with FWD and traction control but not the greatest. Snow buildup in wheel well seems to cause vibration at approx 45mph. Just need to remove before driving."
pontiac,g6,2006,HMB, 03/03/2009,Never Again,3,"I have had my G6 for almost 3 years. It has 63K on it right now and  the transmission slips/jerks sometimes when it switches gears. I have had it looked at 4 times and the last time they told me it needed a computer update and that would fix the problem. Hate to break it to them, but that didn't fix anything. PPl I talked to says it may be the trans fluid, but theres not anywhere to check it, you HAVE to take it to the dealership to have that checked. They said that wasn't the problem either. When you turn the car to the left the steering makes a clicking sound too. My CD player is starting to mess up on me, I'm just tired of having issues with my car. I'll never own another Pontiac!!!"
pontiac,g6,2006,mcompton1021, 03/12/2009,2006 Pontiac G6 Horrible Quality,3,"Again, another 2006 pontiac quality problem.  I have a 2006 Grand Prix with many issues and my wife's 2006 G6 is worse.  This one was bought new by her father for graduation.  It now has just over 30,000 miles and has had the driver side mirror heater go nuts and melt the casing, had the power steering rack completely replaced, the vanity mirror broke and was replaced, and numerous other parts were all replaced under warranty.  I wanted so bad to be a advocate for american car manufacturers but I have given up at this point. Still less than 35000 miles and the car has been in the shop so many times.  New problems keep appearing but now not under warranty so cannot afford to fix"

Interesting enough, I've also had two(2) Grand Am's before this car that had the exact same problem of which would happen randomly.Needless to say i was very very disappointed when it started happening to the G6 especially when the warranty has also just expired. Although they were able to fix the problem ($600.00 later , most of it labor),history has taught me that it's just a matter of when it will happen again ."
pontiac,g6,2006,luvmydal, 03/24/2009,Bummer,3,"I bought my car brand new and was so excited about it.  A year into it I started to have problems with it, and continue to, to this day.  I own it for 3 years now and am currently out car shopping because I can't take the problems anymore.  The car has been in for the same thing about 4-5 times and they can never find what I am describing. For 2 years now it makes a very high-pitched squeak and also creaking from the wheel shaft. We told them to replace, but would not.  As I drive straight, take turns, the noises are always there and my passengers hear it, too.  The moon roof rattles when open.  A part of the seat belt and mirror also brooken."
pontiac,g6,2006,mbryan, 03/25/2009,No compaints,4,"This is my first car, and it still drives fine.  I've had one odd repair needed, where a brake caliper had to be rebuilt, but that's because i ride the brakes, and i did it to myself.  Car handles well, and can give you pick up when you need it.  Very logical car, and would suggest to anyone looking for a well-priced quality car.  People seem to be complaining a lot, but I'm a teenager and mine works fine for me.  It isn't a Lexus, don't expect one when you buy it, but its a more than capable alternative.  Make sure you rotate tires on time with this one though, seeing as how its FWD, and your front wheels do the majority of the braking.  It's a good car, don't let others tell you different."
pontiac,g6,2006,BeRuud, 04/03/2009,Not For The Northern States,4,"I really did enjoy driving this car, it had great acceleration, hugged the road well and had amazing MPG. My Fiance did get motion sickness very easily with this car. In the spring, summer and fall this car was tops... in the winter this car was a liability. Traction in the snow was TERRIBLE, I was stuck in normal driveways multiple times because the traction and tire control was poor. In the southern states this would be a keeper, but since I live in NY I can't get rid of it quick enough. My lease is just about up and I am leasing a new Subaru Legacy which will be quite an upgrade over the G6 in almost every way."

Also problems with leaky sunroof and vanity mirrors replaced 3 times!  LOVE the way the car looks and always got compliments on it but reliability was just awful!  Also lots of problems with brakes and rotars too.  Car has new front and rear brakes and still shakes when braking.  Very disappointed in this car and after reading these reviews its seems like all are common problems.  Too bad cuz the great looks great.  Got a 2007 Nissan Maxima and have my fingers crossed this one is better quality!"
pontiac,g6,2006,missbirke, 04/27/2009,A Really Good Car,4,"I drove this car as a rental on one of my trips then traded in my Focus for one a month later.  This is a really good car.  Easy to drive, smooth on the road.  Nice lines, good fuel economy, lots of rear leg room (very important for tall family members).  A great family sports car (love the power of the V6 engine) and a good value.  My parents have one too.  It's too bad they are getting rid of the Pontiac line."

GM didn't offer any sort of help. All I can say is that I am so happy I bought the extended warranty. I will know bless you with my list of problems: 1. When I replaced the brakes 3 out of 4 had problems.2. 2 new rack and pinions 3. 3 new fuel pumps due to an extended start problem that they can't figure out 4. There is a leak somewhere in the frame that get into the computer and causes A LOT of computer problems. Also, the car didn't hold it's value so now I am about $5000 upside down! What a nightmare! Don't buy it or you'll regret it. JUNK!!!"

pontiac,g6,2006,tom, 06/02/2009,average quality,2,"I have owned this car for 3 years after purchasing brand new in 2006 and it currently has 78500 miles.  Since then I have replaced the tires once, had to have the fuel injection system replaced, exhaust replaced, steering column replaced and replaced the brakes and rotors once.  The engine is noisy and the car squeaks and rattles under normal driving conditions.  The average MPG registers about 25 on the information center with a mix of city and highway driving.  The best mileage has been close to 30.  The brakes are noisy but work fine.  The resale value is not great, I would not recommend buying a new G6 but a used one may provide cheap transportation."

You're in trouble!,4,"*I'd like to note that I am a cautious driver & drove it softly* Came with a 3yr/36,000mi warranty off the lot, bought it with only 10,000 miles on it and at first no problems at all. Great car until I hit 39,000 (conveniently just off warranty) at which point my transmission, airbags, and CD player stopped working, bad timing belt & AC belt. EVERYTHING squeaks inside and out from braking to shocks, even the interior. Cig-lighter/outlets never worked in the first place & were not fixable because of a fuse or something. Oh, and not to mention the transmission isn't even checkable because the dip stick is UNDER THE CAR!!! BAD engine design (though pretty)."

About a year after having the car, the check engine light went on and the catalitic converter needed to be replaced as well as a head gasket.  Thank goodness it was still under the manufacturs warrenty.  The car is loud and nothing what I expected for what I paid for the car.  I am trying to get into a different car because I am so disatisfied but the trade in value is nothing and I am about $7,000 in dept compared to what the car is worth.  I would not recommend anybody buying this car because it will be nothing but a headache.  "

HA!!!,2,"Well I've almost been in so many wrecks because my drivers side window switch is not working properly it will not roll up, when im driving on the interstate fighting with the window that can be very dangerous. My molding fell off within the first month I had the car. My starter hangs and dies, but when my husband took it to the dealership it started just fine im so sick of all the other stuff breaking on it but they did not give me enough room on here! The question, would I buy another Pontiac g6?    hell  no! "
pontiac,g6,2006,Bri, 09/05/2009,Fantastic,4,I love this car. It handles great and I get much better gas mileage than what the dealer and websites all say. I have been averaging about 34miles/gal. The car's design leaves little to be complained about and its very reliable.
pontiac,g6,2006,Azby, 10/14/2009,Don't Buy This Car,3,"Bought this car brand new. Smelled gasoline first day - cracked fuel injector. Visor mirrors have broken repeatedly. Fixed 3 times under warranty - now just broke. At 13,000 miles, groaning in the steering column. Left outer tie rod & steering gear replaced. Now, at 20,000 miles, knocking in the steering column. Dealer response: Sorry, warranty ran out at 3 years (even though there is a Technical Service Bulletin about this problem). The starter also hesitates frequently. I don't trust the car anymore and feel unsafe driving it. A recall should have been issued when the NHTSA investigated steering issues in the G6, instead of sticking owners with the cost. I won't buy another Pontiac."
pontiac,g6,2006,sleepless in st loui, 10/15/2009,wish I wasn't so upside down,3,"I bought it as a demo car with about 7000 miles on it and did purchase the extended warranty. Glad I did after reading other reviews, it seems my car is on the brink of a breakdown because I have had many of the same issues mentioned.  Sometimes it turns over real hard when you start it but they don't know what is wrong.  The tires lose air pretty easily, and it makes this squeaky creaky sound like shocks/suspension but it is not and they don't know what that is either.  Also, it has pulled hard to the left forever and I have had alignments done at all different places and even the dealer look to see if the specs were right and it is still weird. "
pontiac,g6,2006,Chuck, 10/23/2009,Typical GM Junk,3," We got our 2006 G6 buy assuming a lease from a family member. Normally I have always bought/leased a foreign auto but since we were paid to assume this lease from our family member, I decided to give it a shot..Yeah that was a MISTAKE. CAUTION: This car has intermittent loss of powersteering while you are driving. I has happened to my wife several times and we have taken it to the GM garage(towed it actually)and then when the car is restarted, the powersteering works for a short time until it stops working again. My wife won't drive the car anymore especially with the kids. Since I have taken it, it happens all the time. Fortunately, my lease ends in a few days so I can get rid of this car"
pontiac,g6,2006,wade, 10/31/2009,Best car i ever owned!!,4,"I noticed alot of bad reviews? But i also noticed the GTP is reviewing pretty decent? Could be a different assembly line or something? But my car has been super since i bought it new!! I have owned lots & lots of cars! From mercury cougers,mustangs,s-10 trucks all types. & this cars beats em all. On my date of purchase i was also choosing the gto & solstice. The G6 won because of interior room,trunk space,V6-6 speed = power for type of car it is. & i  dont regret my choice! Awesome black ext, panoramic roof, black & tan interior!  upgraded The mass air sensor to jet also k&n airfilter, replaced air duct system to straight pipe & put in a tornado air system.  changed the stock 240hp to 300+ h"
pontiac,g6,2006,pontiac G6, 12/11/2009,GREAT CAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!,4,"I have no idea why people right bad reviews on this car. I get 30mpg+ on the highway. I just change oil as required,did front brakes once and that's it, 74,000 miles The car was cheap and owes me nothing. This is far superior to a civic or corolla,in comfort,style and economy.  "

pontiac,g6,2006,Alisha, 02/07/2010,Pontiac G6,4,"It's fun and pretty....rides quite and smooth...feel great when it turns...really nice to drive. But...I'm now at 84000 miles, and over the past 20000 i've constantly had to get the brakes replaced and rotars turned...it's ridiculous how quick they go out and it starts shaking. I'm also having tons of electrical stuff now....CD player stopped working, inside light quit working, trunk light, right window won't go down, cigarette lighter went out, now the sun roof is wanting to get stuck open, sometimes it has the same starting issues others have described, auto entry doesn't work, and I've been taking it into the show every few months to get something new fixed. After 65000, get rid of it!"
pontiac,g6,2006,wouldn't get another, 02/07/2010,"Decent, but won't buy again",4,"My car, like some of the others also had brake issues. It also likes to hesitate when starting. The paint easily comes off the interior buttons and the visor mirrors break easily. Seems like it needs aligned often. Blind spots are bad when changing lanes. But overall the flaws my car has had so far have been minor. It's been reliable and handles well."
pontiac,g6,2006,kelsie, 03/22/2010,Bought this car and it is a nightmare!,2,"I bought this car and 2 days later it broke down, it keeps jumping and the dealers can't find the problem this car has been in the shop more than I have it! it keeps giving me a signal saying power steering no fuel, but my car doesn't take power steering fuel because it's electric! If the car would work the way it's supposed to it would be a great car! But it don't!"
pontiac,g6,2006,net2008, 04/06/2010,Gonna miss Pontiac,4,Bought this car less than a month ago and I love it so far. It drives awesomely and hasn't had any problems yet. However if you research it you'll find that the power steering does go out because it's electric and it cost about $700 to fix. so I'm just waiting for mine to go . This  should be recalled . but I've only owned Pontiac's and this is by far my favorite. Really fast even with the 3.5 and awesome sound insulation. Remote start is awesome and the sunroof is sweet. However the monsoon system is probably my favorite also. And the 21 mpg is wrong. I get 26 - 27 highway easily and about 24 in the city.
pontiac,g6,2006,Deaun, 04/07/2010,Gentleman Start Your Engines,4,"Although sometimes my auto-start feature will strain my starter out for about 3 seconds, this car is completely great.  I have a family but am also a ""lead foot"" so this car really incorporates what i need in a vehicle along with making it possible to grocery shop or drive around everyone."
pontiac,g6,2006,Dave, 04/23/2010,So Far So Good,5,"We bought this used to replace our 2003 Grand Am that I wrote off...the Grand Am had been great by the way.  We've only had the car a week but so far everything seems to be fine.  Had to replace a blown daytime running light fuse, maybe cause the previous owner had HID lights put in..uped it to 15 amps.  People have commented on the hard plastic cheap feel...the plastic is actually soft if you push on it and nice to the touch, looks much like a BMW 3 series I think.  Fit and finish seem fine, love the style and the drive.  Steering feels good too despite what others have said.  Can't afford import and happy with North American made, too bad Pontiac is no more :-("
pontiac,g6,2006,Russell M., 06/05/2010,Stay away from 2006 Pontiac G6 - JUNK!,2,"I found a 2006 Pontiac G6 for my daughter that seemed to be a good car for the price. A year later I am faced with a $1100 repair to change the power steering assist motor and steering column because of a known GM problem with these type of steering systems. The Cobalt, G5, and numerous others are already on recall. Do your homework, better than that buy a Ford. What a piece of junk!"
pontiac,g6,2006,mda, 06/29/2010,Wish I never bought it,1,"I have had nothing but problems with this lemon. The front made a clunking noise whenever I would make a turn, so I had it fixed under warranty. The u- joints and should arm out at 10,000 miles? Then the brakes went out. Now it is clunking whenever I make a left turn again. The paint on the radio knobs chips off. I was told and shown the rims are bent on the right side. Now the engine light comes on, reduced engine power, and TC light stays on. In the shop right now. The airbag light came on, and had to have the airbag serviced. I might as well have kept my 1994 car, and saved my pocketbook and headache.  Power steering problems that arise from nowhere suddenly"
pontiac,g6,2006,amanda, 08/04/2010,"All in all, pretty content",4,"Bought this vehicle wrecked and replaced front end. Four months later the brakes locked up and I wrecked, having to replace the front end again. If you keep it out of sticky situations, it's a good car. Intake is really low on it as well, so its best to not take it through a deep puddle. Wheel bearings are out at 70,000 miles too. I like the vehicle and reliability, but it's best to invest some money in new brakes and such when you buy one. All wrecked G6s are wrecked in the front, making me think other people have had the same problems with their brakes. But, I think any vehicle is going to give you some problems. "
pontiac,g6,2006,dre256, 08/11/2010,Nothing but troubles,3,"Very nice car, but had nothing but issues on it from day one. Biggest issue is the 3900, the head gasket just leaks and leaks. Dealership made it worse, GM told me to sue dealership. Had my mechanic repair head, stop leaking for 6 months and still leaks. Wasn't for the engine issue I would love this car for years. One big complaint, I feel the seats are too stiff for long rides and need several seat adjustments. But body is very nice and slick, and this car performs well 0-60 in a tad over 6 seconds. Fuel economy average is 18 city and 23 hwy. Don't know how got a 26 MPG hwy ratting, I never have hit that even with car never going over 2500 RPM from a stop."
pontiac,g6,2006,Petroff, 08/15/2010,"Good fo rmoney, but",4,"I have it used - 35,000. Right after 5000 miles i got engine light ON. It was error from gas tank sensor. Then i begin to see my stop light is ON all the time. When i got 73,000 miles my transmission messed up - hard  shifting. All of this problems GM dealer cannot to fix! They are don't know how!"
pontiac,g6,2006,kuhny, 09/26/2010,"Don't make a mistake, I DID",3,"I bought this 2006 g6 brand new. Now I wish I wouldn't have. from day one with the dealership. the first 2 weeks I have a popping in front end, rack and pinion replaced, 3 months later a/c quits working (compressor), within 1 week radio quit working and cd stuck in player, while they had it belt broke, 6-7 months later a/c compressor & belt again, also tensioner pulley found to be bad while in shop, another bad radio and heat/ac vent broke, had sun visor mirror break 3 times, and now have 15,000 miles on it and transmission making sounds/shifting hard. at 20,000 miles had 2 sensors go out. finally at 64,000 miles transmission and thermostat out. what a fun car to drive, but a serious money pit. "
pontiac,g6,2006,donna , 10/05/2010,I bought a lemon,2,"I bought my car 3/2006, brand new, and I have experienced several problems with this car. 2 years ago there was a loud noise coming from the engine and I went to the dealer on 3 occasions and eventually they fixed it. This Saturday while driving, the car just stopped with no warning, in the middle of traffic, on Crenshaw Blvd. I complained to the corporate office the 1st time about the noise and complained about it this time. I was told by the dealer that the engine was frozen and that I needed to pay for them to take the engine apart to see what was wrong. I paid for an extended warranty and smartcare, and I am still being held responsible. I did everything that I was supposed to do. Danger!"
pontiac,g6,2006,Worst Car I've Owned, 11/02/2010,Buyer Beware!,1,"I've had my 2006 Pontiac G6 for almost 5 years. Very disappointing and lots of maintenance issues beginning at 12,000 mi. Engine, electronic steering, wheel, and paint issues. Very cheap interior plastic parts that continue to break or pop off, condensation in headlight, and now CD player has quit working altogether. I take care of the cars I buy but this one has been non-stop repair bills. "
pontiac,g6,2006,bautistaiii, 02/01/2008,Used G6,3,"The vehicle interior is not handsome and the seats are by far not the most comfortable and supportive, the car should have been tinted by the manufacturer. If you live in a sunny state window tinting is highly suggested and get seat covers if you don't get one in leather. It does have some pep to it, when you step on the pedals it does take off relatively quick. The mileage is also surprising in that I am averging about 29/30 on the highway with the V6 so that is a pleasant surprise. The noise inside the cabin is moderate. Use ceramic tint in the rear since the radio antenae is built into the glass. The power pedals make it easy to find a comfortable driving position for my wife and I."

pontiac,g6,2006,Dan, 02/18/2008,Hope you don't get the one I had,3,"I bought this car new from the dealership and it returned frequently. I love the styling and the car is fun to drive when it's new, however I drove more miles with a shimmy, shake, or rattle more than not. At 4K the starter burned up and the car smelled like fire for 4 months. Tie rods wore out 3 times, struts broke, finally a rattle in the front end that couldn't be found. GM finally bought the car back and I move into a 2008 Malibu.  "

I am 6'6"" tall and it has more room and comfort than my old Caddy. It has great peep, good gas mileage, great room for 4 big people and rides like a dream it will be on of the biggest hits for Pontiac in the years to come"
pontiac,g6,2006,Amanda, 05/14/2005,The best car ever,5,This is such a wonderful car.  Its my baby I love it so much.  I'm so glad i picked this car.  it was this or the chevy cobalt and i picked the pontiac G6.  I thought there might be problems with it because its the first everbut there was nothing wrong with it.
pontiac,g6,2006,New Owner, 05/18/2005,Good car. Room for Improvement,3,"I really wanted an Acura TSX but admit that Pontiac discounts and low financing rates were too hard to pass up. When I test drove this car, I was impressed with its ride, handling, looks, and of course, price.  There is lots of room for improvement.  For me, 200 horses is plenty.  The engine sound lame, however.  There is too much lateral movement, especially at low speeds and the car could be stiffer.  Way too much interior plastic.  And finally, what's with the floor hump in the rear passenger area?  Fuel economy is not bad.  At 26 mpg highway, it is well below advertised value of 29 mpg. "
pontiac,g6,2006,Danny, 05/31/2005,Exceeds My Expectations,4,"This car exceeds all of the expectations I had for a new car.  Fun to drive, good on gas and a definite head-turner on the road.  The only drawback I have found is the dark interior which gets very hot in the warm months.  The XM Radio is a decided plus."
pontiac,g6,2006,WEandJB, 06/11/2005,Black Beauty Pontiac G6,4,"This automobile is not only classy looking, it is fun to drive and has a very peppy 3.5L engine that will run with the best of them. It is the closest thing you can get to a Cadillac without actually having to pay the price of a Cadillac.  "
pontiac,g6,2006,Gail Taschler, 06/12/2005,Back to the domestics,5,"After my last two leases being a Volvo, the vehicle is not reliable the overall scenario is arrogance. I decided to shop around and this G6 is just better in every category with many more facilities to get help if necessary, than Volvo could imagine. The grand finale is of course ON Star, what a sensational item. I am absolutely excited about my G6 and so far it is head and shoulder better than the S 70 and S 60 volvo' I had recently leased."
pontiac,g6,2006,Mark, 06/13/2005,All around excellent vehicle,5,"If you are looking at Accords or Camry's you had better check out the G6 before you buy.  GM hit the bullseye with this car.  Great styling, great fit and finish.  Interior is well laid out and comfortable.  I have had the car 6 months and have 21,000 miles on it.  I average 28 - 30 mpg on the highway, and I don't baby it!  Tremendous room inside for a car this size.  One word of caution.  If you are tall (0ver 6 ft) the large sunroof may cut into your headroom.  I am 5'10"" and have no problems.  Trunk size is larger than I expected.  Because of the adjustable pedals and steering wheel, both my wife (5'2"") and I (5'10"") can easily find comfortable driving positions."
pontiac,g6,2006,Stevo, 06/23/2005,Impressive,4,"I purchased this car over a month ago, and the driving still impresses me. It has excellent handling around curves and turns, and stay right with you wherever you want to go. The car gets decent gas mileage, and provides awesome acceleration for a 4-door. Unfortunately the coupes are basically the same car with less doors, so the back passengers will lose space to sit, but in my 4 door there is more room in there than you think. 4 full sized adult males could comfortably go on a road trip in this.

pontiac,g6,2006,Giselle, 07/08/2005,Glad I Got It,4,"I had a 2002 Grand Prix which I really liked but was ready to trade in for a newer model, I never expected to walk out with a new G6 instead. I love it! It's got great pick-up, good on gas, feels safe, stylish and I enjoy the panoramic sunroof; however the leather interior makes it really hot."
pontiac,g6,2006,RSSDRIVER57, 07/10/2005,Hot car but....,4,"I have this car for about a month now and I really do like it. It looks great and is very quite and is alot of fun to drive.The 3.5 engine gives you more horsepower the you will need in any situation. There are several what I consider minor flaws, one of which is the ride. The sports suspension handles great and is very responsive but gives a hard ride. When you go over a bump you will feel it and I haven't gotten the 21mpg City or 29mpg Highway the sticker claims you get yet. Check out suggestion improvements for more."
pontiac,g6,2006,elt2jv, 07/23/2005,Panoramic Woes,3,"After years of fueling the SUV monster, the wife and I decided to get her a regular sedan.  We liked the look of the G6 and we both were taken by the Panoramic Roof feature.  Well... the thing rattles.   The entire rack assembly inside the headliner never got installed properly and  we have been dealing with an annoying poping noise from right above the drivers head.  As of this writing the car is at the dealership for the SIXTH time since April 05 to get this corrected.  All I can say is thank god we purchased the extended warranty as the rental cars would have bankrupt us.  Hopefully the dealer and GM can figure this out as we are ready to lemon law this beast."
pontiac,g6,2007,Tim Holland, 09/01/2015,Best car I've ever owned,4,"I bought a 2007 G6 sedan (base) brand new in 06, just came on the lot. I have had the car for 9 years and I have put 195,000 miles on my G6 and it's still going. The only major repairs was a leak in the gas tank ($800) and a new catalytic converter (at 190,000 miles for $1,000). Other than that, just normal maintenance. The paint has held up well and the the dash looks like it just rolled off the show room floor. I have owned 3 Toyotas and 2 Nissans, and again, this is the best car I have ever owned. It has never broken down or left me stranded, and again...very low maintenance costs. On top of that, I average around 22 mph in the city and on the hwy I still get up to 35 mph (higher than what the manufacturer rates). The ""design"", although 9 years old, is still in ""style"". It's a fun car to drive and own. Maybe I was just lucky and got a ""great"" one, but I am thinking of buying another one when I hit 200,000.

pontiac,g6,2007,Bradley Melton, 10/18/2006,Pontiac G 2007,5,I got my 2007 Black GT G 6 on 9/11. My wife who has hated my previous convertibles loves this one. It is real quiet with the top up. I can now hear my 88 year old mother talk while I drive her around. Looks ? With the top down this car gets all kinds of looks. Power? I only have the 3.5 and this thing moves along real nice. I went to get around some traffic going home form work on 95 S and I looked down and I was breathing on 90. Whoops! At 3K I will switch over to the Mobil 1 Extended Performance oil. The trunk with the top up has a fare amount of room and there is more room in the back seats than I expected.The last Pontiac I had lasted 190K & did not burn oil.Fun Car-Me? I am 58 yrs old.

pontiac,g6,2007,Barb, 11/28/2006,Now I own two black convertibles!,4,"Started out to buy a rational vehicle, since I already own a high performance roadster--(1991 RX7 convertible).  My husband declared the Civic and Mazda 3 boring.  I suggested a 4 seat convertible.  We chose a hardtop so we'd have a car to leave at the airport without worrying.   I'm really pleased.  It's not a sports car, or all that high performance, but it is fun.  Handling is very good for a car its size and the back seat roomy enough for adults.  With this car, I can have my top down and pick up the kids, take the dog to the vet, etc.  Charlie Brown once said the key to happiness is to own a lake and a convertible.  Convertible = fun.  Now I drive one almost every day! "
pontiac,g6,2007,George, 01/19/2007,Pontiac has a viable Competitor,4,"I had the the G6 GTP for two months and its been fun.  Have been a big Pontiac owner for two previous vehicles (98 Bonneville and 02 Montana) and have seen a noticeable improvement in overall quality.  Fit and finish are excellent.  GTP has plenty of HP for the road warrior.  The layout of the dashboard and controls are perfect, although I would have preferred to have the information center in the instrument cluster rather than on the radio display. The adjustable pedals are nice so that my wife doesn't need to change the seat position. I have also notice that the headlights, although bright, don't seem to project as far.  I'm still waiting to see how it handles in the snow."
pontiac,g6,2007,Rob, 03/20/2010,"Fun, and what a deal",4,"I love this car.  The top has never been a problem.  The styling is unique to the convertible, and the techno- hard-top convertible is such an awesome aspect to this car.  When the top is up, and the windows down, voila. a true pilarless hard-top coupe! It is quick, smooth.  The interior 4-place bucket seating is so cool, and so rare these days.  And, the car is big enough to seat four adults comfortably. My quibble is that there is no Ipod port and no built-in blue-tooth.  I will solve those issues on my own though, and they are solvable.  I bought mine used with 6K miles on it 6 months ago.  At $20K, I thought it was a steal.  I have never regretted getting it."

There has been no problems with the car and it is driven a lot. Like others, I also am not crazy about the cup holders and their location.     But I have adjusted to this. The car is really roomy and the backseat console is handy for the passengers because it is not located on the floor. I love the car overall and am very happy with the purchase."

He was almost run off the road by another vehicle trying to move into his lane on the interstate causing him to lose control, hit a guardrail and flip one and half times. The car is a complete loss of course, but my husband walked away with one stitch in his elbow and an abrasion on his hand. The interior cabin (except for the airbag and the windshield busting out) was completely untouched. Everyone including the employee at the junk yard could not believe my husband walked away. I will miss my pretty blue car but I will forever be grateful it saved his life."

Also my wipers stopped working and we do not know why. I have always bought a GM but now I am not so sure.  My seat has already broke the water pump went what problems I am having.

Since it is a hardtop, I drive it everyday with out weather worries. I have owned plenty of muscle cars in my life span. This prior knowledge gives me some view points on this G6. I will start with the favorite features."

My wife thinks it looks better than most of the smaller sedans on the road--it doesn't look like everything else out there.  Overall a very underrated car.  "

pontiac,g6,2007,starlette46, 05/13/2011,No wonder Pontiac is out of Business...,3,"I would never buy one of these cars again, or refer anyone to buy one. I bought the car in March of 2010 with 30k miles on it. It was previously a leased car so I know the maintenance was kept on it. I replaced the tires, brakes, rotors all within a few months of owning the car. Pretty soon I replaced the water pump, tranny cooler lines, intermediate steering shaft, electric steering module, and some oil cooler lines. Just last week I had my car in the service department at my work, and all of my head gaskets needed to be machined and replaced, oil was leaking everywhere!! It was horrible, if I did not have an extended warranty if would have cost me close to $6,000 total for all of the work!"
pontiac,g6,2007,Michigan Bob, 10/05/2006,Fun Car for 2nd Childhood,4,"My wife and I are retired and traded in our Chrysler 300 to purchase this Fun (2nd) car. So far it is everything we hoped it would be. It has great acceleration, handling and braking. We feel safe because of the Stability Control System and the side impact air bags. The 8 speaker Monsoon system sounds great with controls on the steering wheel. We love the fact that it's a hard top in the winter. Everyone we see wants one including our daughter who is out looking for one now.  It draws looks everywhere we go especially when putting the top up or down.  We are getting 3 miles per gallon over what the sticker said and the price was under 30K.  Can't beat it. "
pontiac,g6,2007,olivemcclane, 10/26/2011,Great car that hasn't let us down,4,"We bought this car new back in 2007 and it has been great ever since.
We have 63k+ miles on it and have not had any problems.
We bought the value leader with no frills (e.g. no cruise) at a very reasonable price.
We have only had oil changes and recently a transmission flush and new tires.
We get 30mpg with highway driving, 24mpg in town.
We've had the car for 4 years and hope to keep it for many more.
The only concern we have is the car rattles a bit when accelerating from 40 mph to 50 mph.
No one has found a cause yet.
Overall it runs great and we are really happy with it."

pontiac,g6,2007,Scott, 11/26/2006,Pontiac G6 GT 3.9 4dr 6spd,4,"It seems like this will be a good car.  I'm typically a Mopar guy, but the fact that this is one of the few sedans with a V6/manual transmission is the reason I bought it.  Only complaints are the gas mileage is lower than expected (19.5 city), but hopefully it'll improve as the engine breaks in and the interior scuffs easily.  Not impressed with XM radio, my friend's Sirius seems much better.  The car is comfortable, rides smooth, and fairly quit.  Over all pretty solid."
pontiac,g6,2007,Dakotawyatt, 01/18/2007,Great Car!,5,"I've only owned this car for about a week now.  I researched and drooled over it for 2 years, and finally took the plunge to buy it.  This car is great! The whole car is beautiful, love the comfort of the seats and LOVE the panoramic sunroof.  No awful wind noise at all.  The 2-toned leather interior is luxurious, and the seats fit larger people comfortably.  Shifting on the auto tranny is smooth and barely noticeable, and the engine has plenty of pep in its step! Great interior space; trunk is very big and back seat has plenty of legroom for our 4 year old in his booster seat. Overall fit and finish of the car is fantastic. I highly recommend to any small family not looking for an SUV."
pontiac,g6,2007,no_more_pontiacs, 05/26/2010,Car will come out of gear w/out keys,3,"My car is able to be taken out of gear without the keys in the ignition or by pressing the brake pedal. My car was knocked out of gear 2 days ago and rolled into the street. After contacting GM, they tell me this is normal. Took to local GM dealership and they could not believe it. Still GM is saying it's normal and the Shift Lock Control System, which is a safety feature, is only active when the key is in the ignition. Some safety feature if it doesn't work when the keys ARE NOT in the ignition. This just started happening and they are telling me it's normal and there is nothing they can do. SO BEWARE that you car may come out of gear if bumped! It's normal."
pontiac,g6,2007,sailorbeavis, 06/23/2011,"Not perfect, but very good!",4,"Bought one of these cars off-season last year, fully loaded with the Monsoon stereo, heated leather and low mileage on the 3.9L upgraded V6.
This is my mother's ""fun car,"" replacing a workhorse S10 pickup.
We test drove all sorts of cars, and were looking at a Miata when I found this at a local dealership.
She fell in love with it at first sight and after driving it, had to have it.

This thing moves like a scalded cat and the touring suspension soaks up the bumps great, even with the 18"" wheels.
The transmission is smooth and you can ""row"" the automatic if you want.
We got it as a CPO with extended warranty, to hedge against any mechanical or electrical gremlins."
pontiac,g6,2007,steve, 05/30/2006,got to love it,4,fun to drive easy handling good on gas especially on highway. plenty of pep but not overpowering. only feature didnt like was the on and off dash lights.

pontiac,g6,2007,Henrey, 11/05/2006,Amazing Power,5,"When i first bought my G6 i was amazed of the power this beast has, for the price paid it was well worth the money. Its V6 3.9 liter 240 hp engine is amazing. It is a fun car for the entire family."
pontiac,g6,2007,Marc, 07/04/2018,12 years and counting,5,"I primarily use my Pontiac G6 hardtop convertible for summer use, but it does see winter conditions with the exception of snow. I've just tried to protect it from salt and that kind of grime. It handles the cold temps just fine and is plenty warm (insulated well) with the hard top. I've had minimal issues with it outside of normal replacement of brakes and such and with over a decade of use. I will say the one thing that has bothered me is that you lose the trunk when the top is down, but the back seat can be used as the trunk if needed in those instances. I've taken it on long road trips, and have been on the highway with the top down, and have enjoyed the ride with only a bit of cowl shake. The stereo and speaker system suits the car fine when the top is down. Finally, it does not handle like a sport convertible (Camaro for example), nor does it ride like one. It handles and rides like a regular car, which I'm fine with. It gets up and goes decently and rides smooth.

pontiac,g6,2007,Spencer K., 08/29/2019,Good but not good.,3,"This is all around great car. Pros responsive throttle, great steering and cornering, powerful brakes( though not very responsive pedal feel), comfortable seating, panoramic sunroof, Great visibility while driving/ backing, sounds good accelerating, good mpg~27 highway (15-16 city) ABS. That’s the end of the pros. Cons: panoramic sunroof leaks on front passenger seat whenever it rains, water pumps and coolant crossover pipe gaskets are consumables, rear brake calipers are a non standard worm gear( went to a shop without the tool who used c-clamps and now my repair bill is $500), parking/ebrake is self tightening by the worm gear so you lose ebrake/parking brake too when above happens( live in hilly area, be a shame if the car gets bumped out of park and sent down the hill), the radio has no Bluetooth or aux connection, remember how I said the throttle was responsive it is also very touchy wanting to downshift at the slightest touch, tires this thing is a tire burner $700 bucks of Falken pro g4 a/s every 2’1/2 years, strut tower creaks like mad, no way of lowering the rear seats without opening the trunk. That’s all I have for cons. Good for the teen driver? NO, insurance is as a sports car, yes even the sedan is, plus teen rates is a pricey bill. Midlife crisis on a budget, sure. It’s fairly reliable and parts are sortof available. All around a good car. This is also the SE/base trim car( has the 3.5L/4-speed driveline but NOT the GT package). I hope this helps used car searchers.

pontiac,g6,2007,SteveSoriano, 11/27/2006,Good Choice,5,"Under $30k with all the options, including the bigger engine. Try that in a Solara or a Eos, or a BMW....all of which were considerations for me. The Pontiac guys are so hungry they give these away at invoice, less rebates.  I like the 100,000 mile warranty..  The car is zippy around town, quiet on the freeway, and there is plenty of room for two in the back seat.  I have had better cars, but none for under $50k."
pontiac,g6,2007,Drew, 09/16/2006,Ideal Car for Anyone!,5,"The G6 offers everything for anyone. With all the great models, who could resist? The 2007 GT model was for me. The 225 horsepower 3.5 liter V6 and spacious interior makes for a well rounded car. The smooth transmission is solid and creates excellent fuel economy. I enjoy this car much better than anything before, including my wife's 2006 Honda Accord. This is my first domestic automobile, and I am impressed. Contrary to belief, the build quality on my auto is very high. "

My average gas mileage is about 22 miles per gallon which is decent considering that fact that this is a 3.5 liter 6 cylinder engine. With almost 95K miles on my car, stills runs perfectly. "

Resale value is scary, my trade-in value is $5,000 and I bought car for $21,000 and it's only 4 years old (but miles are high, though). I owe $10,000, so..... s-t-u-c-k with it.

It's no wonder they are out of buisness.
I bought this car brand new in late 2006 and I have had nothing but problems with it.
I've had to replace all of the tires twice, the brakes twice, the blinker, the headlights, and fuel pump.
I've had to fix the A/C and the A/C is out again already.
I've had to get a new battery three times, and had to replace the starter.
I could go on and on with things that have had to be replaced. People always think I get such great gas mileage but I only get about 19 miles per gallon.
This car has cost me so much money.
Do not buy this car!"
pontiac,g6,2007,floridaskater, 08/07/2008,Like the car hate the finish,2,Living in Fl. I use the retractable hard top often and have never had a problem with it.  Although it is a little awkward having to hold a button down for 30 sec. to lower the top.  I have had so so gas mileage.  My major problem has been with the finish on the hood of the car. It started chipping in November 2007. The dealer fixed it then and said they did the whole hood.  Now I am having the same problem in the same spot 8 months later and they want to charge me for the repair.  I have read other G6 consumer reviews who have had the same type of problem. Made a complaint to GM Service center but they went along with the dealer and said it was my problem to fix.The finish is poor on the G6.

I'm 6'4"" and can drive in it somewhat comfortably.  Headlights maybe need a little more power or maybe adjusted to cover more range.  Moonroof and Monsoon radio were nice add-ons.  "
pontiac,g6,2007,Corey, 01/14/2009,Read a review before you buy,2,"I absolutely hate my G6 GT coupe. After 6 months the interior vanity light went out and the brakes started squeeking. I went in for an oil change and had the guy look at my brakes. I am currently at 32K miles. Apparently all my brake pads are shot and all my rotors need to be machined. For such an aerodynamic car, people always think I get such great mileage. I have the exact same gas mileage as my previous 4 door Jeep Cherokee - 19 miles per gallon. Also the sunroof rattles all the time."
pontiac,g6,2007,RAY, 05/04/2009,PROBLEMS,4,"I love my car but this wk found I needed brakes almost ate the rotars out, the brakes made noise from day one and I was told it was dirt, 389.00 later its the brakes, they also found a noice that is a leak in the exhaust but don't know the spot, I have another GMC wiht 85,000 miles and orgnl brakes so its not the driver, I found my garage is the pits, they no longer take you to work(over 5 miles) they will not give me a lender so I am stuck taking a day off with my warrenty still good,,,"
pontiac,g6,2007,Kevin The Krazy 1, 06/01/2009,Great Car,4,"For all of you who have wrote bad reviews about the car, you must not know how to drive. Ive drove my 07 G6 115,000mi in two years. The only two problems I had were dirty fuel injectors and the cadilac convertor was replaced. Finally, after 115,000 the struts are starting to go bad but thats because of all the pot holes. The car runs great, looks great, handles great and im thinking about upgrading to an 09. If you have break problems with only 10,000mi maybe your slamming on the brakes too much and overheating the rotors..."

On a long trip, ride becomes a little hard. When backing up rear visibility not good.  Requires a learning curve on operation of windshield wipers.  Car now has 38,000 miles and rear main seal is leaking oil (but that is covered for 100k on power train warranty).  Also, within last year front main bearing required replacement, dash A/C vents (plastic) broke.  Now, service airbag light occasionally illuminates; so far (knock wood) it recycles and goes off when car is restarted.  Dealership wants $700 to replace airbag seat sensor control module which he says will fix the problem. "

I drive 88 miles each day and dread winter because I know my life will be spent in the car driving 20 miles/hour so that I do not wreck. At 72,000 miles today, I have had to replace the brakes, rotors, and now I have a leak somewhere between the sunroof and floor board. (Car flooded overnight during rainstorm- what a nightmare to wake up to!) Interior is cheap, cheap, cheap! Take my advice- choose a different car! "

The wind resistance is awesome. i think it has to do with the front windshield..i was also surprised at the truck space with even with the top down. i love that it is a hard top, it maykes all the difference, even with the top of it has a ton of room inside back and front and its very stylish "
pontiac,g6,2007,Tim, 08/02/2006,Great hard top convertible,4,"I've loved the Lexus SC but felt $65,000 out of my price range for what I wanted. Security and wondering if and when someone would cut a hole in the top was my hold back on a convertible and having it for winter. Just happened to see a G6 in a parking lot and checked it out on line and found a car for $31000 that did just what I needed. It really needs a place to lock items in when parked and one touch button top operation would be great. Liked the electric blue but found it was only available in 06 and put out the blue gold which I don't care for color wise. Odd they made the prototype electric blue and cancel the color for 07. I love the car anyway."

I like the milage I get, but there can be a big difference depending on drivers. My wife is a ""jack rabbit"" take off person. I reset the MPG computer the other day. After two days of just her driving, she was only getting 17 MPG. I reset it and I drove it for two days and got 26 MPG. If I start making her buy her gas, maybe she will keep that lead foot under control :)"
pontiac,g6,2007,JC, 08/01/2006,Nice Car for under 30K,4,I have owned the car for a few weeks now and everything seems to be fine.  I do a lot of Highway driving so gas mileage has been good just like my previous car and it is more comfortable that my Toyota Camry which I found extremely surprising.  As far as the interior it looks like cheap plastic but like most other cars in the same class and I am not rough on my cars so it should last a long time.  If you live in a hot & sunny area I would suggest buying an $8 magic sun-shade due to the fact the dash board is Foam like plastic and you would not want your dashboard to crack.  Other than that I am pretty impressed for this is my first brand new car I have ever owned.

pontiac,g6,2007,Teresa, 09/19/2006,Great car!,4,Purchased this car for value and the fact that it was a hard-top convertible. It has been awesome! The car drives great and is well designed both on the interior and exterior. It is fun to drive and I always get attention!

Not a fit night to be out, but we couldn't resist test driving the 2007 Pontiac G6 GT convertible.  It handled so well in the rain.  Who knew a convertible could be so quiet? Now the only test, was to wait for the rain to stop and drive with the top down.  It was a cool 58 degrees, but with the heated seats and a bit of feet heat, we were in heaven. Style, Comfort, Handling, Sporty, enough get up and go without being a gas hog.  SOLD!  Loving every minute."

Electronic rear view mirror a plus. Monsoon sound system is excellent sound quality. A real blast to drive."
pontiac,g6,2007,Lindy, 01/28/2007,3.9 sport convertible,5,"Pricing very fair, good incentives with pontiac, wish there was a classier interior look on dash, good acceleration with slightly bigger engine, like the front grill appearance."

Tough to beat."
pontiac,g6,2007,Caffeinated, 01/28/2007,Every Warm Day Is A Vacation,4,"I do love this car.  You get all of the joy of a convertible without the hassles.  Dropping the top is great. During my Wisconsin winters the hard top gives you a stable ride without ragtop noise levels.  It is not Lexus quiet, but I can take it for long drives without thinking about noise."
pontiac,g6,2007,amykrazy, 02/03/2007,Love It!!,4,"Overall this is a wonderful convertible. Looks great, lots of power, easy to drive and lots of cool features.  The price is right and compared to other hardtop convertibles it's the lowest for the stuff you get standard on this car."
pontiac,g6,2007,Jrosauer1, 02/15/2007,Love this car!,4,"Great car! Considered the Solstice at first, but was more impressed with the hardtop option on G6.

pontiac,g6,2007,JimV, 03/02/2007,Great car after rattles fixed,4,"My dealer located the car I wanted, granite grey with ebony-morocco interior...sharp! The day I drove it off the lot though, the roof rattled loudly and didn't retract. I returned it immediately and I have to give the dealer credit. They apologized profusely, gave me a loaner, and repaired/adjusted everything in a few days. On top of that, the dealer worked w the Pontiac factory rep and extended my bumper to bumper warranty from 36K to 60K and even picked up the cost of the rubber mats I had ordered. The car is now totally rattle free and rides much smoother than I had expected and is quite quiet. Power is adequate and mpg is livable. (I'm used to an 350 hp Accord with 29 mpg)."
pontiac,g6,2007,sps97tj, 03/11/2007,Great Car for Great Price,4,"I have had this car for about 2 months now & I love it!  It rides good, gas mileage is decent so far.  The integrated remote start was a key selling feature that has been used almost every day here in Michigan. 2 key complaints though.  Lots of squeaks and rattles when it gets really cold.  I got the tan interior and the driver seat already has wear/dye from jeans.  Still can't beat the price."
pontiac,g6,2007,skijcm, 03/26/2007,My kind of convertible,5,"I test drove several cars before the G6 and none felt as comfortable. The ride with the top up or down is smooth, responsive and fun."
pontiac,g6,2007,whatagreatcountry, 03/26/2007,WOW!!!,4,"I absolutely love this car.  It is amazing, fun to drive, and a great head turner.  Anybody that doubts that GM can build a great car has rocks in their head.  The most heated discussion in our house each morning is who gets to drive it."
pontiac,g6,2007,archstud, 03/31/2007,Couldn't Pass It Up!,4,"The key selling point was the price; after rebates, auto show cash, and GM employee discount the cost of my G6 couldn't be passed up. I live in the Chicagoland area and purchased this car for summer time use only. After breaking in the engine, I took this car on a 1,500 mile, 5 day, 5 state road trip to the Smoky Mountains N.P. This car was a blast to drive on the interstate. With the top down, conversation can easily be made even when traveling 80-90 mph. With a large displacement of the 3.9L engine maneuvering through traffic was a breeze although this car could really benefit from a 5th and even a 6th gear, because it only returned 23.5 mpg on this particular trip."
pontiac,g6,2007,ashbash8921, 04/29/2007,One of the best cars yet,4,"Have you ever wanted a fun affordable car? Well you've found it. Thats right the Pontiac G6 Convertable is one of the nicest, best cars I have ever owned. I have a Mercedes convertable and a BMW sedan and this beats out the both of them. The overall best thing about this car to me is the amazing gas mileage and looks of it."
pontiac,g6,2007,navajofires, 04/04/2007,Love My New Car,4,I just bought this car a few weeks ago. I love the look of the car when the top is down. It drives like a gem. The only issue was the CD player didn't work a few days after I purchased it. The dealership ordered me a new one immediately. I would recommend this car to anyone to buy.
pontiac,g6,2007,RJ from California, 05/02/2007,Gas hog,3,This car looks great from the outside but is a bit cramped inside. I wish it would have come in a 4 cyl. so the gas consumption would be less.
pontiac,g6,2007,Bob, 05/18/2007,Love it!,5,I love this car. I get the best of both worlds.The quiet ride of a standard car and can still go topless. No rag top to be cut. It has great power and rides great!  
pontiac,g6,2007,Robert, 06/04/2007,First Trip Back American,3,"I turned in both a Chrysler Crossfire and Saab 9-3 convertible and bought this car. This car is easy to get in and out, drives well, though turning radius lacks. Comfortable and OK features. For the price, it's a good vehicle."
pontiac,g6,2007,WorldWalker, 07/07/2007,Better Hardtop,4,"I have been looking for a HT/convertible since owning the Ford Sunliner. This car is so much fun to drive and I stole it from the dealer. It is fun to drive and great with the top down. Had a rag top and you guessed it, the top got cut  and it rotted. So much for rag tops. Now I am so happy with my convertible and if it turns out to be lemon I don't care. I will love it anyway. My son and I love it and now he wants me to buy him one.  The top movement is so smooth and no problems like the Sunliner had. Tubes/switches bad"
pontiac,g6,2007,NCDEEWILL, 11/09/2007,I No Longer Have The Cheap Car Blues,5,"Ladies and Gentleman. Hallelujuh, the cheap car blues are over! I have recently purchased a 2.4ltr G6 sedan and I am loving every minute that I drive this beautiful creature. First of all the aggressive sports stance and stunning good looks of my black beauty turn heads. Never had anybody ask about my Civic. Never. Secondly, if you press on the gas this car will run away faster than a stripper from a tent revival. (In case you didn't know that's pretty quick)The engine very smooth and even with the automatic tranny the car is able to get the power to the ground and thus, move quickly. That said, I would suggest this car to the budget minded individual who doesn't want to look like it."

She's a beautiful black sedan with chrome wheels that has bought me nothing but smiles. The car is sharper than a bag of thumbtacks, flies down the highway like a rocket ship, sips gasoline and handles like it is on rails. I receive at least one comment daily about the styling alone! This car is miles ahead of its competition in terms of what it offers for the money. The four cylinder is quite capable of getting you where you need to go without too much waiting. Usually when there is a four cylinder and a six offered in a car, the former crowd complains.Here both crowds sit back in their with evil grins! "
pontiac,g6,2007,Kim, 04/24/2008,Nothing but Problems!!!!!,3,"I bought this car in January 07, to downsize from a Gas sucking Yukon. This is a nice looking car and I thought I loved the panoramic roof. WRONG!!!!  I do love to ride with the roof open but when it is closed, there is so much wind noise that you can not even talk! My car is in the shop now for the 9th time to repairs this. They have had it for 9 days now! GM is involved and I hope they buy it back! Multiple other problems exist as well, brakes, environmental system was putting a bad smell into the car, power steering racks wen out when car was 11 months old, had to have heaters on seats checked. Gas miles not as good as stated."
pontiac,g6,2007,Greg, 05/09/2008,Good car for the money,5,"This is my 3rd new car, and best of the bunch.  Much better than my Cavalier and Malibu.  I am a union worker and only buy American cars.  I don't understand people who live in America and buy foreign cars.  Support American workers, buy American cars.  You will like the G6. "

Besides replacing the spark plugs, brakes, Trans fluid flush and oil change every 3k Ive done nothing else mechanically.  Its insane! She does need a new cat, and the flex pipe has a hole...but at 200+ what else do you expect.

Oh, but the trans does slip.  Ive learned to drive with it.  I 5 starred this bc of pure reliability from a cheap base model car.

pontiac,g6,2007,Mouin, 04/17/2007,Not a good buy,2,"I have bought this car for my wife as a Valentine's present. We had it for 2 months, I have had it at the dealership for 4 times already to work on, Rattling noise in the driver and passenger doors, they worked on it 4 times and problem is still there, they replaced door striker, trim, headlining, also Covertable top has issues, replaced sealing strip, paint scratched off and broken trim piece in trunk due to top not being aligned when closed. Also A/C compressor leaking freon at compressor body, they replaced compressor. Damaged chrome side panel, they replaced it. Overall, it has been unpleasant experience, I am working through LEMON law to have this car returned. Would not recommend it."
pontiac,g6,2007,Lou, 02/12/2019,Great looking blue car that is very reliable too.,4,"Exterior of car is great. Interior is average, plain black. Very reliable car until recently in the past year. First 8 years repairs - brakes pads and rotors (Front and rear), car battery, tie rod ends (Front end alignment), brake pads again, 6 tires and wiper blades every year. In the past year, repairs - car battery again, starter motor, rear coil springs (Broken), cable to open hood of car (Broken). Rubber molding on front passenger door (leaks water inside car). Front door pillars obstruct drivers vision so that you cannot see people in the blind spots at each pillar. Blind spot when backing up the car. You cannot see out the back window to a lower level (guard rail). After awhile you can estimate how far to back up the car. Takes a lot of practice. Buy touring tires only to get a very smooth ride on the road.  Power steering (Electrical) is not as easy to turn the steering wheel as with power steering that uses fluid and pump. It is fine while driving straight, but can be a little tiring on your arms on roads that wind slightly to the left and right. But you get used to it after several months. You can dim the red lit dash board with a dial type knob on the dash board, if you do not like color or brightness.

pontiac,g6,2007,Glad to have a new car, 09/11/2017,Do NOT buy this car!,2,"I know I'm not the only one with issues with their '07 G6 as many of my friends have them too and continually have the same issues. If you live in the city, it's nearly impossible to curb park without popping the beads on the tires. Constantly had flat tires, and always when it was 40 below in WI. On top of that, I basically rebuilt the car and put in all new brakes, wheel bearings, roters, brake lines, tranny lines, etc. up until I traded it in when I started to have radiator/antifreeze problems. I DO NOT recommend this car to ANYONE. Sure, it's sexy as hell and goes fast, but it is not reliable in any way.

pontiac,g6,2007,tess, 04/30/2010,Not sure if i like it,3,"What is that squeaking noise? I bought this car because I had a grand am and I loved it. Not sure if g6 can compare to my grand am. Sometimes when I'm on the highway, it's like, it loses power. Considering trading it in."

pontiac,g6,2007,Matt, 02/23/2017,This car should have clown shoes instead of wheels,2,"What a steaming pile of garbage. The only respectable thing I can say about this car is that I've never had engine failure. Apparently I should be grateful for this. Besides that the list is almost too long to write....and I've already spent enough of my life devoted to this cars issues. Power steering just quitting mid-turn. Brakes that wear out after 5 city blocks...maybe 6 (okay that's hyperbole).  Knocking when you turn. Hole in the exhaust. Numerous sensors failing. Brake lights stuck in the on position. Windshield wiper fluid refusing to spit out fluid. Drivers side headlight housing burns out once a year. Rear spring just fell off while backing out of driveway. There's more....but I'm tired. Good riddance Pontiac.

Has a roomy backseat that my friends said was more comfortable than they expected.  "
pontiac,g6,2007,CRS312, 01/29/2009,Frustrated...but still love the car.,4,"I bought the 2007 gt coupe edition brand new in late 06.  Since then, I have had nothing but compliments on it.  I really do love the car, but I had a recall on the door drains though, and now when there is a good storm, afterwards my speakers crackle and don't work right.  I have been back and fourth with the dealership and they can't find anything wrong!  They just keep replacing the speakers.  If it weren't for that I would absolutely love the car!!! everything else has been fine so far and there are 34,000 miles on it.  Well you can't have your cake and eat it too I guess!"
pontiac,g6,2007,Birdman, 03/05/2008,Great Car!,4,"I traded in an 05 Corvette Coupe for this car, due to relocation and change of jobs. (Yeah-huge task of competing with a Vette!) But seriously, this car has beat all my expectations. The gas mileage is great! I bought the electric blue color, and love it. I knew it would be an adjustment going from a vette, to a G6, but this car has made it pretty easy! Im very pleased with the way it drives and handles, and the leather seats (in my opinion) are better than the vettes were! Very Happy!! and i would recommend!!"
pontiac,g6,2007,mike, 02/20/2007,Not to be confused with a performance car,2,"Expecting Pontiac to try and fill in the hole that the Trans AM left and what the fake GTO left, i thought the G6 would be the little performer for Pontiac...boy was i disappointed. The car sounds lighter than a V4, has no grunt in the motor and well...how can Pontiac name this a ""GT"" unless there's a meaning of GT i am not aware of.  In all honesty, people out there who are looking for a REAL American Muscle car and weren't fooled by the GTO (Holden Monro) or the new G8 (same as GTO) just wait for the 09 Camaro and bug Pontiac to make a similar car and call it a Trans AM."

We finally found that it was an O2 sensor.  Now that it's fixed the car is much better. The looks are great and the performance is even better. This is a very fun car to drive and you will get compliments on how nice it looks. I have the GT coupe with heated leather seats, a welcome amenity in the winter. It is a very fast little car hindered some by the TCS (Traction Control System). Other than that, though, If you are tired of Civics passing American cars, buy this car! It can smoke a V8 Chevy truck. It is also pretty comfortable considering the small exterior stature."

The 6- speed manu-matic is so smooth, you don't even feel the shifts for normal driving, and when you want to gun it, the shift remains smooth (try downshifting - vrooom) The leather seats are extremely comfortable, and the seat heaters come in handy.

This car is very quick and my friends are impressed with the superb road holding.  It also gets decent mileage (I'm averaging 24 mpg city/hwy).  The 6A is awesome (won't find that on Accord or Altima) and the trip tonic will hold gear even if you floor the throttle. 18"" wheels typically scratch easily but the treadwall height on these tires is enough that the tires absorb impact upon curb contact. The 8-spkr Monsoon is awesome.  Excellent cargo capacity with folding rear seats. No reliability issues so far - car has only needed oil changes and tire rotation. Heated seats work well and the two-tone leather looks great. Buy it"

It was peppy when I  first got it and is getting even better as I put more miles on it and the mileage is getting better too. The interior is very comfortable and functional as well. Seats are padded well and hold you in place well. The dash is easy to read and controls easy to reach and use.

The A/C seems to have a mind on it's own and sometimes will not come on, so is the wiper system.  I set the wipers on the continuous speed setting and they will go intermittent on me.  Last issue, my top won't retract anymore.  I bought the car brand new and only have one user, although I love my car, for the price I paid I was expecting more from GM."

City is not so great but I recently went on a 1500+ mile road trip and was getting 30+ mpg, thought the computer might be broke so I figured it out myself and I wasn't dreaming. Handles great and is smooth and reliable in these New England winters."
pontiac,g6,2007,Dano, 11/04/2008,Love My G6,4,"What can I say about my G6? From the first day I bought it I have loved every minute. The way this car handles around tight corners to the smotothness of everyday driving. I have owned Toyotas to Fords and have never thought much of American made vehicles till my G6, GM has really set the bar for demestics. I am excited to see what they will come out with next, and yes I will be a GM owner for many more years to come.   "
pontiac,g6,2007,Myra, 11/23/2008,"What the heck""",2,I brought my 07 G6 Pontiac going on two years ago. My car been in the shop more than 12 times for different issues. Steering gear went out 3 months of me having the car. Three months later it happens again. Back lights went out. Air bags need service light comes on but never been in an accident. Brakes replaced. The computer system reset had to get a jump for it to get reset. Wheel bearing needs to be replaced. So many issues with this car not a good car to buy. They need to have a recall on these cars or give us our money back!
pontiac,g6,2007,jnellky, 11/28/2008,So disappointed,3,"Was in love with this car bought it, and have been incredibly disappointed since I've had it. I love everything about it except it's had so many problems. Steering issue, oil leaks, waterpump leak, steering fluid leak, rodars changed, breaks changed, battery changed. Only has 40,000 miles should not be having all these problems & only owned for 1 year, used. Very sad but have to get rid of the car before I become anymore upside down in it. Do not buy this car even as attractive as it may be you will regret it!"
pontiac,g6,2007,dobbins8394, 12/22/2008,Love my G6,4,I was sorry to hear all the bad reviews! I bought my 2007 G6 brand new and I haven't had any problems out of it! It drives great and I get great gas mileage! I love the interior and the exterior. The lighting inside is great. The car has a total of 52000 miles and is still going strong! I have even been rear ended and the car was repaired and I haven't had any problems still! This was a wonderful investment! 
pontiac,g6,2007,KIMBERLY, 12/21/2008,"Great car for 10,000",4,"I have to say this is a great car for the price, 1 year ago you couldnt buy a new car like this for 10,000 I have to say thanks to the economy for my great deal! Drives great in the snow! Lots of room in the back seat and trunk! Everyone who sits in my car can not believe how comfortable it is, and it can go! Gas is not great but hey the cost of gas is no longer at $4 a gallon! My next purchase will be the G8. GM has made a great car!"
pontiac,g6,2007,Mr Bill, 12/24/2008,Don't waste your money,2,"This is a very poorly built car. This car has only 35k and I have a list of problems as long as my arm. Brakes shimmy bad, steering column squeaks, roof rattles (this isn't even a sunroof car), dash is already warped and buckling, cruise control quit working, engine leaks oil and looks like a ball of grease from below, one wheel bearing went bad, front bumper keeps poping out under the headlights, lots of wind noise, windshield wipers are oddballs and cost a fortune. This car was babied and as soon as the 30k warranty was out everything just started falling apart. Last, this car has no trade in, or resale value. It isn't worth half of what I paid for it. Now I can't even trade it off."
pontiac,g6,2007,Danielle, 01/07/2009,I love my G6 but,4,"I have had my G6 for about a 1 1/2 now and it has a little over 25 thousand miles. I am having brake issues. The car feels like I am riding with my brakes on. It's like the car is fighting against the brakes. If I let off the gas the car will come to a complete stop on its own. There has been a couple times that the front end of the car will start shaking really bad when I am going over 60 miles an hour and that is really scary. The dealer ship has shaved my rotors, replaced the brake booster and now they are going to replace the master cylinder. I really hope this solves my problems because I really do like this car. It rides nice, I like the look and the gas mileage is great. "
pontiac,g6,2007,Andrea W, 01/24/2009,Desperate for help,4,"I do love my G6. The handling is great, love the way the steering feels. My complaint seems to be an isolated one, but I have had mine in for repair over 10 times. The SES light keeps coming on. Doesn't seem to drive differently when it does, just annoying. GM has not been cooperative. I suggest going with an auto make who cares more about their customers."
pontiac,g6,2007,Forever Young, 01/31/2009,Such a Shame,3,"It is such a shame that this car is so awful, I love this car, but it is a rolling junk heap. It looks great, and it is a good thing that the monsoon stereo is awesome, b/c it drowns out alot of the popping and cracking the car makes, from the dash to the, rear end to the steering column, to the sunroof, oh my at the noises!!! I am so disappointed, I need to trade it in, but I can't b/c I am so upside down in the payment. Dealerships and GM do nothing to resolve issues. I really love the car but it has so many problems, gas smell inside, stalling out, back firing, everything rattles, brakes, rotors, you name it. I have always driven Chevy's and love them, I will never own another Pontiac!!"
pontiac,g6,2007,Dez , 04/06/2009,"2nd review after 40,000 miles",4,"Don't get me wrong I love this car for some reason mostly cause of the looks! but I'm a car guy so I can't ignore the fact that this car is mediocre. Its leaps and bounds better than the grand am, but If you consider other cars in this class it is not on there level in refinement. suspension noise is too pronounced and is a bit underdamped. the car is not agile at all and drives big, although the steering is good. The stock stereo is crap and if you get an aftermaket unit you lose the trip computer big flaw. this car makes too many noises which effects the perception of quality. That said the car is sold it just does its job and nothing more, its like a Gap model with a personality flaw. "
pontiac,g6,2007,Michelle, 04/14/2009,I Love my G6!,4,"   I have had my G6 for almost two years and I love it! I paid for the extended warranty, just in case, and have never had to use it once. Rotate the tires, change the oil...that's it.    My only complaint is the terrible wind noise when just the rear windows are down. It's awful! Just never do it and problem solved.       "
pontiac,g6,2007,Eric, 04/11/2009,2007 base v6. Great!,4,"My base 3.5L v6 sedan, pretty well optioned. Owned Camaros before this.  Loved the looks, safety, options for the price.  MSRP $21,800, paid $16,500 before tax with haggling and incentives.  I have had it for 1.5 years and ~25,000 miles,   No issues.  Not sure everyones issue with fuel, being a base I have a 3.05 final drive, maybe that helps but I see 22- 24 city, and 28-32 logged and calculated by hand.  Not bad for a midsized car, that is roomy enough for my 6'5"" guy.  Yet still has some enough power to actually pass people with ease on the road.  Is the interior top of the line? No, but its not bad.  Its plastic and fake leather, like every other car under $30k. Cheap/fast/economic"
pontiac,g6,2007,AmandaJo88, 05/06/2009,"Fun enough, but not impressed",3,"I bought this car 3/2008 used with 29000 miles but I am starting to worry about problems. My trip odometers reset on their own and a few months ago I noticed rotten egg smell and it started to guzzle gas like no tomorrow (I have to get gas 2x/week when I used to 1x/wk). Burning smell/rotten egg smell with hard acceleration. Sunroof squeaks and interior side panel rattles. However, I do enjoy driving fast and keeping up with all the other ""racers"" out on the road. But the longer I drive, the slower the car seems to accelerate. Overall its a nice fun car to drive, but doesnt seem as reliable as it should be. "
pontiac,g6,2007,downsthgagirl, 05/24/2009,not worth your money,2,"Purchased brand new and started having problems/safety issues from day one. Mechanical, steering, wiring, brakes, rotors, engine, and throttle body has gone out. Contacted gm customer service and not getting any help. Car to dangerous for me and my son to be in but now one wants to help me. "
pontiac,g6,2007,deb, 01/05/2008,I Love It,5,I bought a G6 Convertable in Iowa in Jan. 06- talk about faith! It was quieter to drive than a Camry and more fun than an Accord!! This car has been a wonderful drive for my husband and I! It is a solid and dependable drive and even is comfortable for 4 adults and a Yellow Lab dog!! The mileage is impressive and handles solidly! Thank You GM!
pontiac,g6,2007,85cieraholiday, 01/05/2008,Back to Pontiac,5,"This is the car that got us back into a Pontiac after our Honda Civic was totaled. The Pontiac has the 3.5L V6 that is fast as all heck and the interior is comfortable with nice buckets and power everything standard. Ours has the remote starter that is great on cold New England mornings. We get many comments on our Pontiac, something that never happened with our 2000 Civic. This a family car for people who miss the fun of driving."
pontiac,g6,2007,maa, 01/06/2008,Good value,4,I got a good price on this and needed a commuter car. It is peppy for a 4 cylinder and roomier than others in its class. The seats are comfortable and it is easy to see out of. This thing flies when I get it on the open highway. I am getting keyless entry put in aftermarket - can't believe it did not come with this
pontiac,g6,2007,Marc B, 01/09/2008,Get a G6 and live!,4,"I just bought this car to improve my MPG for work and play.  Advertised at 20 City and 30 Hwy, this is a solid car that is fun to drive so far.  I am about 6'1"" and can sit very easy in the front or back.  Zippy V-6 will make you drive more aggresively if you are not careful...life is short, live it! I got mine well equiped for under 20K."
pontiac,g6,2007,ccsr, 01/13/2008,Glad I choose this one,5,"I purchased this car to replace a 2003 Mazda 6 w/ 190K miles. I can not get over how happy I am with my purchase. Who said base model cars have to be stripped down or cheap? Not this one! The car handles like it should cost more and its so quiet and torquey you won't even realize you're blowing by posted speed limits like its nothing. Although I bought it used with 15K miles on it, I still have the remainder of the factory warranties and a vehicle that in my opinion outperforms the Mazda in all aspects it makes me dread driving my wife's boring 2007 Toyota Camry. If anyone is in the market for a solid built midsize car don't neglect checking out the G6, it will surprise you."
pontiac,g6,2007,Steve, 06/12/2009,Caution,2,"Purchased 4/07. Wheel bearing replaced at 12,000 miles. Now at 20,000 back in the shop for ""clunking"" in the steering. Car will not stay aligned, constantly fighting the steering wheel (aligned 4 times). On the positive side, looks good, 3.5 engine runs well. I bought the sports package, maybe that is the problem. Will still buy American, probably not GM. "
pontiac,g6,2007,pah75045, 06/17/2009,NEVER A PONTIAC AGAIN!!!!!!!!,1,"This car was a piece of junk!!! I bought this car with only 28,000 mi. The car came with its original bumper to bumper warranty.  At 29,000 mi I had grinding in my steering wheel 36,000 mi everything really went to heck. My steering wheel once again stared making the grinding sound again. The car started to loose its power and the car started to get horrible on gas. By the time I traded it in I fill up at least 4 and to some time 4 times a week. At 38,000 I had to replace the brakes and let me tell you it like rocket science to replace those brakes. At 40,000 my struts were out and it was going to cost me 1200 to get them replaced. "
pontiac,g6,2007,Angela, 07/20/2009,Great car,4,"I purchased this car in February '09 after trading in my '03 Chevy Impala. I'm very impressed with it so far. It had 35,000 miles on it due to it being a rental car, yet I haven't had any problems at all. It drives great and looks awesome. I've had GM vehicles for the past 5 years and haven't had any major problems with any of them. Now if only Ford could do the same. lol!"
pontiac,g6,2007,KK, 07/25/2009,"It's a decent, reliable car, very roomy!",4,"I have owned my 07 for about a year and a half. I have had minor issues that I have taken it into the dealership, but nothing major thus far.  I agree with other people about the interior plastic type pieces being cheap. Other than the cheap plastic pieces it's an overall good car. The trunk space is amazing!!!!!"
pontiac,g6,2007,adam, 09/20/2009,its a so-so car,4,"I like my 2007 2.4l g6 it drives well and I bought it new. At 23,000 miles I didn't have to do any Major repairs. I have noticed that when you turn and take off fast there is a ""clunking"" noise that is starting to annoy me. I have called the dealer and they said it must be because of the speed I'm taking off at but that's not true."
pontiac,g6,2007,Scott, 09/25/2009,Got worse with more miles,3,"Car seems to have gotten worse with more miles.  I now have almost 29,000 miles and I've already had to replace the brakes, turn rotors, AC stopped blowing recently, numerous alignment and tire issues, needed to get the steering column lubed (now it's starting to make noise again), had to have passenger side airbag sensor replaced once and serviced two other times.  Unfortunately it feels like the reliability is not there.  It feels like the more miles I get on the car the more things go out.  Car handles well and cruises real nice at high speeds on interstate.  I feel like Pontiac just threw this car together real quick.  I will shop around more next time."
pontiac,g6,2007,Brittney, 09/28/2009,I hate it,3,"I traded my 06 ford explorer off for a g6 because I started to get too high off mileage on my explorer and I needed something that got better gas mileage. I liked the way it looked on the outside. The inside wasn't bad at first and it drove alright. Within the first month it was in the shop three times for rotors, brake pads and steering column problems. Now, the silver trim is peeling off. It looked cheap on the inside to begin with but now looks even cheaper."
pontiac,g6,2007,Bob, 10/21/2009,2007 G6 3.5L sport package,3,"original owner, intermediat steering shaft,brakes and now in shop for intake gasket leaking oil. It's all covered but would be Pist if I had to pay out of pocket. Dealer set me up with a rental car and less than 1 day to fix each time. I like the car and handles good with good power. The 6 speeds are way over rated I have 4sp A/T and have logged 32MPG loaded down on our trip to Canada with A/C cranking (72MPH). All vehicles have issue just look them up. I work for import car company and they also have issues some worse some better. MPG on the imports are about the same give/take. With demand for MPG 8 speeds,dual clutch and more CVT transmisisons. Little improvement, heavy and big $$$$"
pontiac,g6,2007,Stacie, 10/31/2009,good car,4,"I've had the car for just over two years with 38k miles on it and I didn't have to take it into the shop until just before it hit 36k for a minor air conditioning issue and a seat squeak. Took it all the way to Georgia...great gas mileage - about 31 per gallon for those trips. Gas mileage in the city is even better after that trip. It's been a great, reliable car and I moved from the Alero - which was a good car to this."
pontiac,g6,2007,rob, 11/16/2009,Must be just me...problems..problems,2,"Ok we will start with the 6,000 mile warped rotors that they dealership told me was typical after they tried to accuse me of being to hard on the brakes??? at 9,500 miles the rack and pinion went bad..gm knows there is a problem so they put a bulliten out to grease them.well after 500 miles the grease worked its way out and then they had to replace the whole rack.squeks I can not figure out where they are coming from and neither can the dealer.just two days ago my wife handed me her key fob and told me the battery needed to be replaced..so i opened it up and surprise,surprise the soldier joints have broke??who has actually broke a key fob,Now I guess I will just have to see what breaks next"
pontiac,g6,2007,TexasGRL, 11/28/2009,Looks can be deceiving,4,I bought this car in 2007 with less than 16k on it. It was great for the first month then I started having trouble with the steering and the sunroof leaking. It took more than 4 times being in the shop to fix both the sunroof and steering. This car has LOTS of rattles and squeaks that thankfully the monsoon sound system blares out. This is my 1st GM vehichle. Have owned a mustang and a F150 which i got rid of to get this car. Let's just say my f150 had 180k on it and ran like a dream - would rather take it on a trip cross country than my g6 which now has less than 50k on it. Now having horrible gas mileage ( about 19mpg ) and brakes squealing awefully. Just had new brakes less than 1 yr ago.
pontiac,g6,2007,jazbo01, 12/20/2009,Runs good decent mileage looks,3,"My wife bought this car with 20K on it a yr old. It has 75k on it now the car shakes VIOLENTLY when you brake from highway speeds always has. In the snow.. what happened to the ETS off button from the grand ams..you cant get any momentum in deep snow. it rides like a rock you cant spin the tires in deep snow and braking on ice.. abs is wayyyy to sensitive.  now the heat went out on her.. i took a look and found very low coolant levels. I am a certified auto tech and I drive a toyota 4x4, my wife will have a yota before spring. Every GM I have owned i have not been happy. for a truck I have dodge-no issues for everyday toyota 4runner-incredible, no wonder GM is in trouble..but runs good go gm"
pontiac,g6,2007,Brandon, 12/25/2009,Horrible Ride 4 college student,3,Im a college student so i needed a reliable ride! This was definitely NOT what i was expecting. Car was good at first then became extremely horrible. Kept up with the maintenance but the stupid POWER REDUCED spell kicked in anyway! Ended up trading for Nissan Sentra and will never look at an American car the same way!! 
pontiac,g6,2007,Jon, 01/19/2010,Steering Problems,3,"I bought the car with 13 miles on it, great car, always started in the cold (-45 degrees f). Then i noticed I had a clunk in the front left. The dealership ""never heard anything, and can't see any problems."" This was common during turns especially with more that one person in the car, they finally fix it. It was the strut, it wasn't secured right. They secured the strut but the sound was still there, the rack & pinion had to be replaced, twice. The starter went out at about 40,000 miles. 43,000 miles, the clunk now turned into a squeak, it happens even when I get into the car. I'm glad I splurged and got the 60mo/100,000 mile bumper-to-bumper warranty. The dealer hates me, oh well."
pontiac,g6,2007,Lisa, 03/03/2010,I like this car...,4,"I have just bought a 2007 pontiac G6 GT, yes I know I'm saying I like it now because I havn't had it long, but it has done me well so far, it does have a little popping noise when I turn the wheel, but my car has 40K and was totaled, so not a big deal yet. My brakes are a little bit of a problem because I'm used to touchy brakes and these are soft compared to my old car, still not a big problem I'll have to adjust. All cars have problems,I know that,they were a newer car(2007)and there was going to be bugs. Not every car is the same just some are lemons. Trust me this car is alsome conpared to all the other cars I have had. The only other car I would take for this car is a Mazda or a Honda"
pontiac,g6,2007,Brandi, 03/12/2010,"70,000 Miles",3,"I keep up the maintenance on it and I drive it with care. I have not had any of the brake and rotor problems that I read about. I did have a loose screw in my brake caliper and something was wrong with my rack and pinion that was covered under my warranty. The seats are hard and unsupportive. The plastic on my factory radio buttons has peeled off from normal use and until the motor warms up it has trouble switching gears (since I hit 60,000 miles). I get great gas mileage though around 28 MPG. Also due to the design, the back doors stay dirty and I can't keep them clean. I would recommend this car, but don't buy one new or you will be 8-10k upside down as soon as you drive off the lot."
pontiac,g6,2007,seekwolf, 03/03/2010,OVERALL GREAT CAR,4,"I have the sport package with the 3.5 L V6, i bought this car for a decent price @ 29,000 miles. It was a rental car and it hasn't failed me yet. IT has gone on 1200 mile trips getting 30 mpg twice. And it has gone on 800 mile trips twice with no problems what-so-ever. I haven't had to do a thing except change the oil every 3-5k. I bought a extended warranty and didn't get to use it. Annoying."
pontiac,g6,2007,kas652, 03/25/2010,Great middle of the road car,4,"I purchased my 2007 G6 used with 24,000 miles on it.  I've had it for 3 months and am very satisfied with the car.  I have no serious complaints to report. It is not a luxury car by any means, but it is a step up from a corolla or sentra, while not costing much (if any) more.  Overall, a great car for the price!"
pontiac,g6,2007,never buy pontiac, 04/05/2010,I'm never looking at another Pontiac.,2,I got my G6 in May 2008. Complained about the brakes up the first two weeks of me buying the car. (7000 mi @ purchase) I have been to the shop complaining about brake numerous times! The car is always ticking and making a squeaky noise. I have no clue what it is. The check engine light has came on a few times. I want to get rid of this! Sticking with Honda and Nissan from now on! I would never buy another G6 or suggest that anyone else does!!
pontiac,g6,2007,Angela, 07/19/2010,Great car!,4,"I've had this car for about a year and a half now and I have absolutely no complaints! I bought it with 32,000 miles as it was a rental car, but it looks great, runs perfectly, and the 3.5l V6 is perfect. Such a fun, sporty car to drive. I love it! I don't know what everyone else is complaining about. "
pontiac,g6,2007,Linda, 08/07/2010,Love to Hate Pontiac G6 GT Convertible,3,"Always wanted a convertible, husband pushed me to get hard top retractable for safety reasons.  I have really enjoyed the look, the feel, and the convertible.  Several draw backs in the build mechanically.  Replaced the front rotors twice already, 57,000 miles now replacing the water pump and soon will need to replace the intake manifold.  Live in country, roads rough, but not abusive.  Had collision with a dear and was amazed at the little damage caused and appreciative of how safe I felt. Cost to fix was very high, front bumper and headlamps, cost 7000.  Covered under insurance, however very high. Brake pads seem to go often, every 3-4 months, don't live on big hills like in PA either."
pontiac,g6,2007,letty, 08/14/2010,i love my g6,4,"I have had my g6 for 2 months and i absolutely love it. i just came back from summer vacation and drove from corpus christi tx to orlando florida and back.my car did wonderful, i wouldn't want to have anything else."

It has the pano roof which now needs minor adjustment for wind noise no water leaks. We like this car so much we went out and got the same year convertible we like this car as much. I will suggest getting ice and snow tires for the winter. "
pontiac,g6,2007,Jessica, 08/31/2010,Average Luxury Car,4,"I've had my 4 cylinder G6 2007 for about a month. The first problem was it has warped rotors. My car was a lease with only 20,000 miles on it so I don't understand why it has warped rotors. The mechanic says that it could easily happen by slamming on your brakes while going through a deep puddle of water at high speeds.  Yeah sounds simple but if thats the case that sounds like an accident that was not reported. Next, either I like to drive too fast or the car is slow at kicking in speed. I previously had an 2003 Alero with 121,000 miles and it drives very similarly to that. Not good or my Alero was in excellent condition (and it was)But for an 07 I expect more. Overall the car is great! "
pontiac,g6,2007,Kamea, 09/21/2010,Take that Hybrids!,4,"Many friends laugh when I mention my car gets over 35 mpg on hwy.  I average a 150 mile commute everyday and my meter can vary from 32-42 mpg (varies on my speed, 65-80 mph).  either way I LOVE IT! I schedule my oil changes every 5,000 miles (not 3,000).  I have not done my transmission fluid change, yet. and I've put over 87,000 miles and it still runs like new!"
pontiac,g6,2007,Ryan, 11/26/2010,Right when they got it right.,4,"I have owned my G6 V6 for over 2 years now, I had one item replaced under warranty which was the transmission cooler lines because they started to leak at the fittings.  I did have to replace my brakes prematurely but that is mainly because I bought it used with 19,000 km on it and it had sat in the lot for almost a whole year and the rotors got rusty.  It drives great, gets good mileage, looks pretty good tinted out with black rims. The stock stereo is amazing except for the lack of an aux. input.  One other mechanical issue I'm having is my left front strut already needs to be replaced (leaked out) @ 48,000 km. Definitely premature to the 80,000 km recommended replacement. Even so still happy!"
pontiac,g6,2007,pontiacdude4, 04/05/2011,"Good car, Resale Not Good",3,"2007 with 85,000 with no problems, minor issues. The engine rattles with AC on, steering wheel issues under warranty, radio knobs wear off. But the interior, although plasticky, lasts and the seats covers are durable. Seats are tough, not very comfortable, exterior styling is great, interior pretty good, too. Automatic start is great. Mileage is good, I have the 4 cylinder and get 25 overall (22/29??). For a 4 cylinder it's fast. Have XM Sirius which is awesome ($16/mo), I recommend it in any vehicle. Depreciation, though, is off the chart, I am very upside down. Best to buy this car used with 40-60,000 miles for like $7 grand.... I'm selling mine, taking a hit, getting nervous bout miles."
pontiac,g6,2007,Robbia, 02/24/2008,Cushy Car!,5,"I love my Pontiac G6!  It feels wonderful to ride in--a very cushy, soft ride.  I have the Value Leader and am glad I didn't opt for the higher priced model, because this one is just perfect.  All I added was the spoiler, which I like. Otherwise, this is a great car.  It has a lot of pep for a 4-cylinder!  I previously owned a Pontiac Firebird and thought I wouldn't find anything better, but this car is sweet with great styling, and gives the feeling a luxuriousness that the Firebird did not.   I feel very mellow in this car.    "
pontiac,g6,2007,mamamia, 08/17/2006,convertible,4,"I have had this car for one month, it has spent 8 days of this in the shop for a rattle in the dash. It seems someone forgot to put some of the parts together. Other than that, I love the car, it handles great, is extremely comfortable, and gets great gas mileage. My husband also really likes the car and loves the way it handles. We drove 6 different convertibles before settling on this one because we can take another couple with us if we want to, this is not an option with any other car we looked at. I also get a lot of looks with this car. I have even had people pull up beside me on the interstate to look at the car. Would I buy one again, yes."
pontiac,g6,2007,ugh lee, 07/15/2006,I like the retractable hard top,4,"As the owner of an older Ford Mustang convertible, it is so nice to not be worried about having to replace the top every 5-7 years.  The interior is amazingly roomy nad safe .  We have three kids and the back seat will comfortable seat tehm as they get older (the 11 yr old boys are not much shorter than my average height wife) and the front seat is real safe with the dual stage air bag (one heck of an improvement over two pint seat belt and no air bags in the older car).  It's also quiet and comfortable with the top down!  Heated seats are a great way to increase top-down time in the Fall."
pontiac,g6,2007,Tex, 07/19/2006,Hot convertible,5,"I love driving to and from work wiht the top down. It has been over 100 degrees this summer, and yet even with the top down, I can feel the AC....The look is great, and the fun doesn't stop...I hvae the GTP with the bigger engine, and it has plenty of get up and go - sacrificing some MPG in the process"
pontiac,g6,2007,G-6 Hardtop converti, 07/28/2006,Fun car!,4,We have really enjoyed our G-6 Hardtop convertible.  It has been so much fun to have a fun car at a reasonable price.  
pontiac,g6,2007,First Pontiac, 08/27/2006,First Convertible,4,"We are extremely happy with our purcahse.  No problems with the top, works perfectly every time.  The car is a great cruiser, it is not a sports car.  Power is adequate, the car is heavy at 3800 lbs, has good ride with minimal body shake and seats are very comfortable.  The car is extremely quiet with the top up and with the top down conversations can be had without yelling.  The car is gorgeous with the top down and looks just like the coupe with the top up.  Every time we take the car out we receive compliments on its looks.  The only issue we had was the door striker was misaligned, but the dealer took care of that in 30 minutes.  We would highly recommend the car."
pontiac,g6,2007,Robert Cacciotti, 08/31/2006,"Great car, good ride",4,"Car is very easy to get in and out. Seats are great, one of the best seats that I have sat in. 3.9 liter motor runs very well.  Top works great.  Best of all it does not have a dollar sign on the hood  i.e. benz, bmw, lexas, Volvo ect.  For the money great buy in my book."
pontiac,g6,2007,Michelle, 09/02/2006,Awesome!,5,"What a great Car!  Hot, comfortable, fun and compared to other vehicles with similar features, it's relatively inexpensive."
pontiac,g6,2007,danny boy, 09/14/2006,pleasantly surprised,4,"The hardtop,convertible sold me on the car as well as the looks of the car.Driving the car I found it to be very ""tight"".I could not hear any squeaks as I went over bumps.The steering wheel is a little""tight"" but once you realize this it is easy to overcome when turning the wheel.I like the car and the style. I'm glad I purchased it."
pontiac,g6,2007,Jim, 02/02/2007,"Good Value, but few things missing",4,"Just bought my new G6 with the 1-SV package. The price was GOOD (under $15K) and it's fun to drive. I like the gas mileage (30), size (not too big, not too small), look (SHARP), and handling (smooth and responsive). I don't like the driver's seat (too narrow) and the missing features (no cruise control or remote locks). Also the sun visor mirror has plastic covers where the lights should be (looks cheap)."
pontiac,g6,2007,Brian R, 01/28/2007,Happy with my purchase,4,"The car is good looking, fun to drive, and gets really good gas mileage.  Can't speak for the reliability (because I've only owned it for a month) but I'm optimistic.  The cupholders are inconvenient.  Overall, the car is roomy, comfortable, fast, fun, and a good buy!"
pontiac,g6,2007,MJW70, 02/11/2007,My new G6,4,"I love this car!  I had researched for the last couple of months before buying, and I am very pleased with this car. So fun to drive and plenty of room. Very tight steering and handy/easy to read gauges. "
pontiac,g6,2007,Joanne, 02/07/2007,Best car I have ever had,5,My husband and I purchased this car after I did lots or research.  We went to buy the value leader but purchased this car instead.  I am only five ft. tall and the adjustable pedals and seat are great for me. I also have the 17 inch tires.The ride is smooth and for a 4 cyl. the pick up is great. Every time my husband drives it he comments on the power. I also find this car to be very easy to park. I love everything about this car. My daughter drove it and also loved it.  This comes from someone who buys a new car every three years.  I hope to have this car awhile.  
pontiac,g6,2007,pontiacg607, 10/08/2011,The future freaks me out.,3,"I like the way my G6 looks. Otherwise, the car make me nervos.
My steering has made that infamous clunking noise since I bought it, but when I bought it, the car was already out of warranty, so I just live with it. At this point, I don't even notice it anymore. I also had to stick a piece of cardboard inside my key fob because the part that holds the battery in place broke. The interior is cheap, but attractive. 
The car has nearly 82,000 miles on it and hasn't seriously let me down yet, but I am starting to get worried. I do have a wheel bearing going bad I think. I will keep this thing until it dies, but if I could do it over, I would do my research and buy something else."
pontiac,g6,2007,samuel, 02/28/2007,The ultimate vehicle,4,"The G6 handles nice and smooth, it is a very good car for the price. the interior is user friendly, the stereo is loud and clear. it does not scratch the cds when used. The fuel economy is very good i went to philadelphia with a stop off at atlantic city which is about 300 miles approximately one one tank of gas with some to spear, also one half a tank back to brooklyn.  i recommend this car to anyone, it is much better than my last 3 cars put together.   the insurance rate for the vehicle is  alot cheaper then some other vehicles as well. it handles solid in the snow, it does not slid even without stability and traction control.  go for a test drive you will not be disappointed."
pontiac,g6,2007,Glinda, 02/22/2007,Lots of fun with My G6,5,"This is the first time i have ever purchased a vehicle and, was very impressed with my purchase.  I have seen the commercials and was instantly impressed.  When i first sat in the car for the test drive and stepped on the gas i thought to myself "" i have to have this car.  The roomy bucket seats and the nice and smooth ride left me speechless and comfort should be defined as Pontiac g6."
pontiac,g6,2007,Dawn, 03/06/2007,My G6 -4DR 3.5L Engine,5,"I love this car. I did a lot of research before making this purchase, and drove a lot of cars. The G6 was fun to drive, had sharp steering, and was powerful. It has an excellent turning radius, and I love the styling. I'm very happy with the purchase."
pontiac,g6,2007,Gregg, 03/06/2007,More than I expected,5,Very roomy especially in the back seat.  Nice standard features.  I am averaging 27 mpg on a 35-40 mph loop.  Very responsive power with 4 adults in car. Very little wind noise even at higher speeds.   The cars gets a lot of comments and looks from people.  I looked at over 30 different cars in this class and found the G6 the best car for the money.  Hopefully it will hold up over the long term.  Dealer has been honest and very helpful through the whole purchase process.  I highly recommend this vehicle for the price. 
pontiac,g6,2007,Phil , 04/05/2007,Best thing since sliced bread,5,"I purchased my G6 only a week ago and it only had 23 miles on it. I now have 515 miles and it seems the more I drive the car, the more power it has, and the better the MPG gets. I'm very pleased with the options the car came with for the money. I wanted a new car and didn't want to spend a fortune for one. To make a long story short, for the money, this is the best built, best performing, most comfortable car I've ever owned. Pontiac you have made me a happy man.....so far. Hopefully I won't need the 5yr 100K powertrain warranty. "
pontiac,g6,2007,Tiffany, 04/26/2007,Love my G6!,4,"I am very happy with my G6!  I purchased the car in January and haven't had a second thought about. This is the first car I have purchased on my own, and it was a very good experience.  I would highly recommend the G6 to others.  Just be careful, it drives very fast!!"
pontiac,g6,2007,jen, 05/07/2007,Loving it,4,"I did my shopping around and the G6 is the best overall buy I could find. I test drove a lot of cars out there. The G6 won. I got a great price, haggled and got leather for free. Totally loving the XM! I only wish that it had radio options on the steering wheel.  "
pontiac,g6,2007,jbanks25, 05/02/2007,Value and Style,5,"When it was time to replace our 3 year old leased Malibu we wanted something with similar gas mileage and a little more style.  The G6 fit the bill perfectly.  25 More HP than the Malibu, and 27.5 average MPG."
pontiac,g6,2007,wvu , 04/21/2007,Gone But Not Forgotten,4,"I had driven less than 700 miles on my car when I was rear ended by a tractor trailer at a stop light. The truck skidded for more than 45-50 feet. The car was smashed up to the back seat. There is no trunk left. My car was totaled. The police officer said that the car did its job and that he would recommend getting another. My son's car seat was intact (he wasn't in the car). There was glass all over the back seat. However, the impact stopped at the back seat. I plan on buying one again. Hopefully this one lasts longer than 20 days."
pontiac,g6,2007,m, 06/03/2007,Value Leader Package,4,"So far, so good at 2,000 miles. Getting a combined 26 MPG with highway consistently in the 33-34 MPG range. Traded up from a 1999 Civic for more room at a very competitive price without losing too much in mileage performance."
pontiac,g6,2007,Kevin, 06/03/2007,Good value,4,"Gutsy little 4 banger. I've driven 80 mph with the a/c on and gotten just shy of 30 mpg. Good highway driver. Comfortable driver seat, I like the tilt/telescope wheel. I have long legs and short arms, so it allows me to get a good position. Great stereo. More room than expected in the back seat. Trunk has room in it but bad fit for golf clubs."
pontiac,g6,2007,Debbie, 06/23/2007,What a Feeling!,5,"I shopped around for a new car for a year, and had always considered the G6 sedan until I had the salesman showed me the convertible. All it took was looking at that sporty coupe turn into a great looking convertible with the push of a button and I knew what would be in my driveway! I love having two cars in one!! When the top's up, you can't even tell it's a convertible, inside or out. It looks great going down the road, and then I put the top down and you know that everyone is looking at it, whether they want to or not.  "
pontiac,g6,2007,daddyearwig, 07/09/2007,I'm surprised....so was the wife!,4,"This is a great car, I'm impressed and surprised. Great riding, strong V6, nice clean appearance, and very roomy. Wide wheel base makes this thing turn like a boat. Console and shifter area kinda awkward. Too close together. Not enough storage.  Small trunk opening. Sharp looking, I guess the people that stole my factory wheels thought so too. (Get wheel locks.) My wife was avid about not getting this (or Pontiac in general), had to give her her own set of keys.  "
pontiac,g6,2007,dm, 07/21/2007,Fun Car,4,"This is a fun car to drive, gets decent gas mileage - I get at least  27 on highway and 22 in the city.  You'll contantly look at the speedometer because it's so easy to go over the limit w/ this car.  I have about 15K miles on the car w/ no problems."
pontiac,g6,2008,candy, 03/18/2016,Never kept a car 7 years before my 2008 G-6,5,"In 2009 I was looking to replace my 2000 2 dr Grand Prix with a nice sporty sedan with a V-6. My used car dealer called and said he had the car for me but I had to come look at it.  He told me it was prior salvage title with only 14,000 miles on it but he wanted me to see the damage before it went to the body shop. Light hit right front fender, no frame damage. We decided whoever the previous owner was must have worked for or been related to someone at the insurance company as there was no way this should have been prior salvage! The body shop I selected did an awesome job at matching the paint. Beautiful burgundy with subtle metallic. I now have 107,500 miles on this car.  I've owned it since April 2009 and I have never done anything to this car except put new tires on it (the original tires lasted until it had about 65,000 miles on them) and have the oil changed every 3000 miles. Never had any motor problems, (not even funny noises) or tranny or other issues. Loved the way the V-6 responded as I am a bit of a lead foot driver. Still, mileage was pretty decent, city/hwy averaged about 21 mpg and strictly hwy driving averaged about 25-26. Maybe less than estimated but better than the Grand Prix. When washed and waxed this car still looks gorgeous! The only drawback on the interior was the fabric seats. They showed stains from just plain bottled water, not happy about that. Otherwise it had plenty of room up front in the bucket seats, back seat was roomy and comfortable and the trunk also had plenty of space to haul stuff around, and I did! It has pretty much all the electronics and extra features you could want including the electric sunroof. (it was not the accordian type I had seen sitting on a lot when I first started looking.) Now that I have over 100,000 miles it has developed a few rattles but still rides great. Too bad GM isn't still making the G-6 as I would purchase another one in a minute!
"
pontiac,g6,2008,luck5393, 06/28/2014,Good so far,4,"We have had this car for a few weeks now.
I do a lot of driving, and it has been a very good car in the few weeks we have owned it.
I activated the XM radio in it, it tends to loose a signal when going under bridges or parked next to 3 story buildings.
the engine is very responsive and the steering is tight.
I bought it with about 91000 miles, so it has already been well broken in.
The interior is roomy, and the back seat is very roomy for the size of car it is.
One option that I wish it had was being able to pull down the 40/60 seats from the interior of the car and not just from the trunk."
pontiac,g6,2008,Sam, 12/22/2015,4 Car Pile up,5,"I drove my '08 G6 GT for exactly two years (to the day) before any major mechanical repairs were needed (I had to replace the engine but it was due to the mechanics error, not the car). In general the car is a great car but what really got me was the safety. I always swore if I got in an accident in that car I would be dead or extremely injured, due to the bucket seats and the car sitting so low. Last month I was in a 4 car pile up on a highway 301. I was the middle vehicle (the smushed one) and had an F-150 slam full force into the back of me and ultimately on top of me. Because of the body of the car the trunk actually caught the F-150 and stopped it from going any further on top of my car (opposed to a Honda Civic or Toyota Camry which the truck would have driven right over and crushed the backseat). Although the car was totaled (obviously, I was SMUSHED BAD) it did everything it needed to. The engine shut itself down to prevent a fire from a gas leak or anything else, the underneath of the car took most the damage from the front, opposed to smashing everything into the dash. Not a single window broke. Right after the accident everyone involved got out, including myself, and just stared at the car in amazement that it held up the way it did. I never write reviews or go to the extent of doing this but it's the least I could do for the car. Hands down I would buy the car 100x times over. I miss it SOOOOOO much. I've been test driving all different cars and have been in 3 different rentals since and nothing compares to it. Everything about it was great (minus a few electrical issues like windows rolling up or down or random lights coming on and off but that's a GM thing and those issues usually fixed themselves over a course of 24 hours or so). Plus, for all the fellow lead footers out there, the acceleration is great but it also maintains speed very well.

pontiac,g6,2008,Cindy L, 12/31/2015,Nice ride,5,"I had my G6 almost 5 years & put a lot of miles on it due to my commute and l loved if. My husband wants to keep me in a car under warranty so we just traded it. I am sad! 
The car drove extremely well.  I put over 140000 miles on with no major problems. It was a very nice car. Pontiac needs to come back!
"
pontiac,g6,2008,sunaku89, 08/10/2013,Awesome to/from car!,4,"My dad purchased the car for my sister and I for school and EMS duties. Fun car to drive, great on gas mileage but some problems with the design and interior. Example, To get the headlight out to replace the light, you have to pull apart your flimsy (Extremely flimsy) bumper and the grill will pop out if you aren't careful. Mine now has a small crack now from me trying to replace the light bulb.There are also electrical issues that have melted my wires. The back locks are faulty and very often will not lock when you lock the car or unlock when you hit unlock. The seats are comfortable but you have to be careful about reaching behind the seat because you can pop the plastic out of place too."
pontiac,g6,2008,Greg & Mindy, 06/13/2008,Worth the wait.,4,We purchased our G6 convertible in January 2008 and then patiently waited for warm weather to arrive. During that wait we found that the remote starter on our G6 works great from inside my office while the remote starter on my co-worker's BMW would not work from the same office. The car is a joy to drive with the top up or down. Many co- workers thought it was a sporty coupe until the top folded into the trunk. We are pleased with the gas mileage we have been getting. No long trips yet but around town mileage is averaging close to 20 MPG. The trunk is basically useless with the top folded down but we knew that when we purchased it. We are very happy with our Pontiac G6 convertible. Enjoy!
pontiac,g6,2008,Hordewar, 07/27/2015,"Hold on tight, its a wild ride!",5,"This is an extreamly great car for school, work, and just to either deck out or just drive. Its verry fun to drive and the fuel economy is the best ever compared to my old 85 s-10, it had a v6 2.8l but it was a mess, this car saved me and its awesome.

pontiac,g6,2008,Gary B., 04/18/2009,Midlife Crisis Resolved,5,"I love everything about this car! The ride is smooth and comfortable with plenty of power, zip, and pep. It's simply a blast to drive top up or top down. With the top up I've heard a few times, 'how is that a convertible'? I get fond looks and compliments from many folks with the top down. I enjoy driving it as well as being a passenger. Move the front seat a notch or two and I'm comfortable in the back seat and I'm 6'2"". I know there's room for 4 adult sized adults in this car. No room in the trunk with the top down? So what, there's plenty of room in the back seat. Mustang can't say that!"

pontiac,g6,2008,Couger, 02/08/2008,08 G6 Convertible,4,"Overall, a great car. In the handling departement, it competes well with Japanese models. It doesn't compete with the German cars, but it's a lot less expensive, and sportier looking to boot. Anyone looking for a convertable would do well to consider the G-6. The seats are comforable and well designed. The lack of a power recline feature on the power seats can be overlooked. The height of the arm rests are perfect. So far, we havn't had any probles with this car.  This car looks and feels great. Some one else mentioned last year that college girls love this car. It's true. Just trust me on this. If you're a single 20 or 30 something guy and can afford it, buy this car. "

failing me one after another (wouldn't recommend them). I average about 21.5 mpg due to mostly stop and go but at low traffic times I get about 18 city and bested 31 hwy on a trip from Tx to WI with family. At about 65,000 mi the steering started clunking due to the intermediate steering shaft which I had replaced and the rear passenger side door lock stopped working, other than that
I've had no problems with the car. Its quick when you need to blast onto the highway

Every now and again it simply refuses to start altogether and dealer can't duplicate the problem.  We will replace the car as a ""fix.""  We also have strut noises and rattles.   Bottom line is that you will the pay the same in the long run as if you bought a Honda Accord by the time you factor in repairs and depreciation.  You may get it for much less now, but in the long run you will pay the same and be miserable along the way. "
pontiac,g6,2008,Convertible Steve, 06/29/2008,Best 4-Seat Convertible Value in the US,5,"By far, G6 hardtop convertible is the best value in this segment. All expectations have been met or exceeded, & it has been relatively free of ""surprises.""  Noticeable negative is interior plastics.  GM really ""stretched"" to make this a truly affordable, modern 4-seat convertible, & for the most part, it succeeded.  Top mechanism is unbelievably complicated, so an extended warranty is likely to be wise purchase.  Power of 3.5L engine is fine, but occasionally feels sluggish at highway passing speeds.  Surprisingly, fuel economy exceeds 17 city/26 hwy EPA estimates by 10 - 15%. Tranny is well-mated to engine. Wide turning radius, but otherwise handles well. And best of all, a rock-solid ride."
pontiac,g6,2008,Dave, 07/13/2008,Life is better now that I have this car,4,"I test drove all 4 of the reasonably- priced hard-top convertibles. Mazda was too small, Chrysler was not good, the Eos is worth a look but to get one with all the great features the G6 has would require spending about 3K more. I loved the G6 during the test drive but some of the negative comments I read in professional reviews were discouraging. After buying the car, I know those comments are unnecessarily over-critical.  Comments on the lack of trunk space when the top is down are silly.  Its a hard-top. Where else does one expect the roof to go?  Many people have commented on the poor quality of interior material.  I dont get it. The interior is just fine. I highly recommend this car"
pontiac,g6,2008,GMnomore, 03/15/2009,My last GM?,3,"After buying a 2008 G6 GT (with the 3.5 L V6) I would not recommend this car. This is my 5th GM, 4th Pontiac. Seems the designers wanted to build a nice car, but fell short. By 18k miles the car:  -Front suspension clunks -Steering clunks -Vibrates at highway speed -Idles rough -Heater smells of coolant (core leak?) -Transmission sometimes fails to shift (rare) -Tire pressure monitor cannot be set manually -Heat shields resonate -Brake pedal binds slightly -Steering column makes rubbing sound  I made several trips to 2 dealerships. So far, most problems have been considered ""normal"" by GM dealerships and remain unresolved.  Sadly, this is very likely my last GM."
pontiac,g6,2008,Gary, 01/29/2008,Oh what your money can buy,5,"I really got into the car buying process this time.  I compared this car to the Toyota Corolla and Camry, Honda Accord, and Nissan Altima.  This car list at 18,875 and is very well equipped at this price: Several thousand less than Altima, Camry, and Accord.  It has a smooth, responsive feel and compared to the others cars I test drove much more pep! Hands down this car out performs any foreign car in its class that is price even 2,000 to 3,000 dollars more.  Not to mention the the 2,000 dollar rebate that GM was offering, the additional 1,000 loyality cash (since I have a 1999 pickup).  Final price 15,400 compared to 19,000 plus for Accord, Camry, or Altima.  Time to buy American."
pontiac,g6,2008,ballbreaker910, 05/17/2012,Not very Fuel Friendly,3,"I purchased this car with 44k to replace a 2003 Mitsubishi Galant with 203,000 miles. It came equipped with a sunroof, remote starter, aux jack and onstar. Was excited to purchase this car especially since GM boasted that this car would get over 32 mpg hwy which was where this car would spend most of its time. However I was only able to get 17 mpg combined. I spoke to 3 GM mechanics & was sold a load of crap about winter air causing loss of fuel economy and trying to use Hess or Shell gas to get better gas mileage. Nothing worked. GM would do nothing to assist. This 4cyl car was a gas-guzzler. I also own a 2005 Grand Prix (V6) that gets way better gas mileage. Other than that, I liked it"
pontiac,g6,2008,jla, 08/18/2008,I love this car!,5,"As a former Grand Am owner, I have been looking at the G6 for quite some time. When I found a good deal, I jumped at the chance.  This car is great.  I drove it to my home town, which is 90 miles away, and it was both comfortable and fun to drive.  When I first got it, I kept trying to think of places to go so I could keep driving instead of coming right home from work.  My last Pontiac lasted me 13 years and I'm sure this one will last a long time as well.  I'm a true ""Pontiac believer""."
pontiac,g6,2008,OldMGDriver, 09/06/2008,My Latest Convertible,5,"I've had a 1958 TR-3A, a 1972 MGB and a 1988 Chevy Cavalier Z24 convertible in my driving lifetime and this is the best overall package in the bunch. The only drawback is the tiny trunk when the hardtop is stowed, but, for heaven's sake, it IS a hardtop convertible! The thing must go somewhere! Fit and finish seems excellent.  Several storage cubbyholes in the cockpit are very handy for stowage of manuals, remote controls and other ""glove box"" items. ONStar and XM radio are wonderful additions. The ac/heater vents have provided a perfect home for my Garmin GPS. We'll see how she likes the trip up to our condo in Flagstaff."
pontiac,g6,2008,happytoes, 10/08/2008,Fun & economy!,5,"I am loving my 2008 Pontiac G6 convertible with greater mileage than I expected (32 MPG hwy/22 city).  Just so fun to drive, & observe the admiring glances at the car.  The acceleration, relative quiet of ride, on-command manual transmission, sound system, fit & finish are up to the most finicky standards, for the price range. Such a great value..I am very happy with this car (former Buick LaCrosse CXL owner) "
pontiac,g6,2008,Bigchief, 10/11/2008,Wifes loves her car,4,"With a family of 4, this is the only choice for a convertible. Excellent all around performance. A lot of rattling after 1000 miles, the dealer greased the door latches and no more problems. The brakes started to squeak at 3000, the dealer installed ceramic pads (under warranty) problem solved. The fun factor is 100% as well as her satisfaction."
pontiac,g6,2008,GXP Street Edition, 12/22/2007,Awesome GXP Street Edition Sedan,4,This car replaced a 2005 Altima 3.5SL - The Pontiac has a taut smooth ride that doesn't feel too harsh. The transmission is very smooth shifting and the engine turns low rpms at highway speeds in 6th! Interior is very nicely appointed and feels contemporary with a European influence. The longer wheelbase on this car compared to many of its' direct competitors gives the Pontiac a more refined ride and drive. Great build quality and a quiet interior makes for a stress free ride! Plenty of power on tap for any situation will put a smile on your face. All this at a very competitive price. Pontiac hit a home run with this GXP package!  You can't go wrong with this vehicle in your garage
pontiac,g6,2008,Peggy Woodward, 01/08/2009,Fun Car to Own & Drive,4,"Finally bought my first convertible. I looked for about a year before deciding on the Pontiac G-6. So far, I have been pleased with it. I have had a few rattles develop, but the dealer has taken care of them, no mechanical  problems. I get a lot of looks driving around  town with the top down, Really fun car to drive, and for  the money, you could not beat it.  "
pontiac,g6,2008,ThomasM, 04/22/2009,Excellent G6,4,"i recently got my g6 after I turned 16, and it's been awesome to drive. The engine is peppy and quick. I'm 6'1 with long legs, and was skeptical about getting a coupe, but this car is very comfortable in the front and back. Extremely stylish exterior, i get compliments all the time. Just a few problems. Gas mileage kinda sucks, (18 mpg city). If you drive push the gas hard just one your whole tank of gas is gone. Often the air conditioning smells of coolant..? Also, back tires spin out very easily. Besides that, the car is awesome. Suspension is smooth and allows very quick and sharp turns easily.-- Beautiful Car"

I would recommend this car to anyone look for a fun sporty yet daily driver car. Love this car, I'll definetly have it for a long time. Exterior design is great. No need for any upgrades, street edition comes loaded."
pontiac,g6,2008,ajl, 12/21/2009,G6 is about GM and its struggles,3,"I have inherited this car, so it's not one I would have purchased. I would have at least bought a V6 model.  The build quality is pretty good. At 13k miles, it's still really solid, no squeaks or rattles. The interior is much better then any GM car I can remember, although still not Honda or Toyota quality. Lots of room in the back seat, although the outside visibility is poor compared to the imports I'm used to.  The engine is very coarse compared to a Honda and the 4 speed automatic hunts for gears and shifts into overdrive too early.  Not a bad car, not great either. FYI: Owners manual recommends premium fuel for best performance. In a base model car? "
pontiac,g6,2008,Laz Profit, 04/11/2010,Great Car,4,"I purchased this car as a used rental, and after a quick trip to the dealership to get the warranty items fixed, the G6 purrs. I love this car. There were 2 necessities, when I made the purchase. Performance and leg room for a big guy at 6'2"". This Sedan was the perfect choice. I had no intention on walking in and buying this car, but after the test drive I knew I had to have it. I'm tired of Hondas (Buy American), and I used a Camry for a rental, wishing the whole time I had my G6. Best part, I can now add my own features.. Sun roof, turbo and low pro tires to keep the look of this car stylish. I don't plan on trading this one in - very dependable.."
pontiac,g6,2008,Cisco Contreras, 08/18/2010,I love my new G6 GXP,4,I've had Pontiacs in the pass but nothing comes even close to my new G6! I love the way it drives and how it handles. Wish there was a navigation with it but the interior looks are amazing! I am starting a new family and I couldn't made a better decision when buying a new car. 
pontiac,g6,2008,krazzyh27, 10/26/2010,Low Fuel Eonomy in town.,4,"I just bought this car used from a rental dealership. I love the car except that I am getting terrible gas mileage in town! Only 13-15mpg. (I have an occasional lead foot.) On the highway, this car is superior, getting between 25-35mpg. I do 90% town driving though, so this is a little frustrating for me. I owned two older Ford Taurus before and this car handles much better but it is getting about the same game mileage as the dinosaurs I traded in on it. My husband and I are 5'8"" and 5'9"" and we have decent room in the front seat and my daughter is 5'10"" and has just enough in the back seat. Not much room for extras. Car seats 4 comfortable, a 5th smaller person ""touching arms"". "
pontiac,g6,2008,twdavis, 02/03/2008,My new toy,5,"I have always wanted a convertible but knew a soft top would not be good for me as I don't have covered parking. The only hardtops out there were not affordable enough for me...then came the G6! Thank you Pontiac for making my dream car a reality! I absolutely love my new toy! It's so much fun to drive, it's very sporty and looks awesome with the top up or down! I get looks, honks and thumbs up from everyone! I chose the black with tan leather interior and walnut burl accents. It looks like one of those more expensive cars on the inside. Very classy!"
pontiac,g6,2008,jay haga, 03/05/2008,What is it ?,5,"When i saw the commercial announcing the 08 G6 GXP street edition, I knew I had to have one. One week later she was sitting in my garage. I never expected all that she gives. performance is great, from the 3.6vvt,the six speed automatic, and 2.77 gear ratio. Quick as a house cat out of the hole and cruises at less than 2000r's. She feels very nimble cornering and goes great in the snow. I find the seats very comfortable and all controls to be where they should. everywhere I go someone will come up and ask ""what is it?"" Pontiac has definetly hit a homerun in my opinion. Looks, style, performance (she's not a race car but a great commuter), and fuel mileage for the 21st century.   "
pontiac,g6,2008,Greg, 03/27/2008,Good value for your dollar,3,"Purchased for $12,000 (Thanks, GM Card dollars!).  At that price nothing really competes.  I was able to get the dealer to add cruise, and for those that really want remote locks that can be added as well.  Note the gas mileage will be less if the car has the 3.91 axle ratio, but will have more pep.  So if you are shooting for 30 MPG be aware of the ""optional"" axle ratio issue.  Easy to drive, but a little hard to get in and out of as doors are narrow top to bottom.  I do 90% highway cruising, and this is quite and very smooth for its size.  I understand wiper blades are expensive, so try and get covered under bumper-to- bumper warranty.  Also, no key hole on passenger door, seems odd."
pontiac,g6,2008,J, 04/15/2008,Looks Great ! Drives Great !,5,"Not only does it have the look of a sports car, but it handles like one.  Yet, it is very spacious interior and large trunk.  Unfortunately, I can say it does great with rear accidents, only scratches to the bumper with 40 mph impact.  Monsoon radio sounds great!  Leather seats are incredible comfortable."
pontiac,g6,2008,Alexandra, 10/18/2017,Still runnin strong!,5,"Bought my 2008 G6 from a friend who bought it brand new in 08. It's got 188k miles on it and counting. In the 8, almost 9, years I've owned it I've put it in the shop ONCE for a bad radiator hose... $200 later and she's still clicking right along. Everyone says Pontiac is garbage but I beg to differ. This car has been extremely good to me. Regular oil changes, fluids, tires, regular maintainence is all she's needed. Doesn't do that great in rain, have yet to test it in the snow. But overall a super solid car. Wonderful gas mileage. Drove from east Texas to western Pennsylvania on two tanks of gas. Only bad thing I can say about the G6 is they don't hold their value that well. Love mine!
"
pontiac,g6,2008,tim, 10/26/2010,Good performing sedan,4,"I bought this car because I needed a four door car due to my expanding family. Didn't want a plain Jane car. I really love the styling of this car. It has everything I need. Power is great, plenty of room, decent gas mileage, when I keep my foot out of it. Had some steering noises in which the dealership fixed under warranty. This car proves driving to the grocery store doesn't have to be boring."
pontiac,g6,2008,steve, 03/31/2009,g6 is reason for gm failing,2,"Purchased this 08 g6 for my wife and it was a nightmare from the time we purchased it almost 2 years ago till we traded it in a few weeks ago. Premature brake failure on rotors and pads at 6000 miles, Pontiac says it was due to wife's poor driving habits and would not cover under warranty. Then the iceing on the cake was when the steering went out at 9,000 miles and I had had enough. If I had done my research on this car I would have seen that brake problems and steering failures are a common problem with the g6 and gm refuses to do anything about it."
pontiac,g6,2008,Unhappyg6owner, 04/19/2009,1st and last GM product.,3,"Bought this car over a Ford Mustang convertible because it was front wheel drive. Wasn't impressed with the acceleration, but this was after driving the Mustang. In the beginning I loved the car. The car looked great with the top down and even better with the top up. Sluggish and had too much pause between shifting. Horrible in snow, so ended up driving my truck all winter anyways. Now almost 8 months later I am in a rental car while I wait for my transmission to be fully rebuilt. The moldings around the seats are coming off for no reason. There is no where to put anything. Cup holders are in a bad place. Random rattles. More things, but running out of room. Should have bought the Ford."
pontiac,g6,2008,Susan, 04/27/2009,Don't get me started,3,My advice - don't fall for the fact its a convertible!  I bought my car with only 3000 miles on it.  I owned it for 6 months and called it quits.  I would have paid for the dealer to take it back.  I did love it when the top was down but that is all I can say that is positive.  The car constantly pulled to the right.  The hardtop constantly rattled when it was closed.  The breaks didn't seem to want to stop and forget trying to drive it in the snow.  It scared me to death.  I had to get rid of it.  I now own an eclipse again.  I actually feel safe again.  Is the car cute?  Yes.  Hot?  Not hot enough to stress over daily.   This is my opinion. Others seem to love it.  
pontiac,g6,2008,madashell, 09/06/2010,Warranty issues,3,"Bought my car brand new - $19,000 + - paid cash.  First year - awesome except radio replacement due to the buttons chipping - 2nd year, serpentine  belt, u-joints.  3rd year - getting radio replaced AGAIN due to chipping.  Seats are fading - was told it was due to the mileage - umm, 30k only.  Have GM now involved - but they just want to give me a certificate for $4k off a new GM car.  You are kidding right?  I'm buying Ford and cannot wait until this radio is put in so I can get a decent private sale or trade in.  What a joke -  and what a thing for a dealer to say seats fade at 30k!  No more GM for me!"
pontiac,g6,2008,Paige A, 02/08/2016,"Stylish, fast and comfortable!",5,"Low gas mileage. Head room is average, so if you are tall this is not your car! Looks great with top up and down. I get a lot of compliments and head turns because there aren't many of them out there! It is fun to drive and the sound system is great. Getting in and out of the backseat is difficult, but this is not a car you buy for a family or for frequent trips with groups. Getting groceries is ok with the top up, but of course with the top down the groceries have to go in the back seat because the top is in the trunk. Surprisingly good trunk space with the top up though! Overall this is a great convertible and the hard top is a great thing for those of us with cats! The only negative is that the trunk is very heavy because of the roof lift mechanism, and the trunk eventually ""wears out"" in that it won't stay up when you lift it. A friend with the same car said it is very expensive so e to fix that so you just live with it.
"
pontiac,g6,2008,Gene, 04/16/2018,Great geezer fun car.,5,"We were getting too old to travel on a motorcycle so we opted for a convertible. Didn't know they even made hardtop convertibles and we love it. Buying used we were able to afford the luxury model and all the gadgets. I'm glad it had the optional 3.9 engine (just because it's still fun to push the pedal once in awhile). It's just a fun summer car so the lack of trunk space isn't a problem. Fuel economy is great (avg. 25 mpg highway). Repairs have been few even with 88,000 miles on the clock.  Ours has the 3.9 V-6 option which is far superior to the standard 3.5 V-6 by comparison. Nothing much to add for 2020 Only driven in summer, less than 3000 mi/yr. Still under 100K. In 2020 we've put les than 1000 miles on it. Just inspected in June and it's for sale. We still love it, just don't have time to use it.

pontiac,g6,2008,pos, 04/11/2009,Pontiac Owner Suffers,1,The best way to review a car like this is to list the part that have been replaced at 14000 miles  blower motor  windshield air leek ONLY when its cold out (ice on the inside...took 20miles to melt) NOT Fixed by dealer  Sunvisors will not retain position (If you have a 08 g6 take it in for this they stopped making the ones they put in the car because they are so bad )  Brakes and rotors  Door made a noise when you stop.  they just greased it. ( umm thanks GM ???)  Engine ticks (when its cold) they did nothing to fix this. I was told they all do that.  Engine idles is not normal ( car shakes when im at a stop light)  They all do this i was told.  I will list more on my favorite features...
pontiac,g6,2008,veritas57, 07/23/2011,Less than I expected,2,"Quality that is. Purchased this car from a dealer with only 18,000 miles. Could have chosen a model with the V6, but chose the 2.4 Eco. MISTAKE! This car can't get out of it's own way, especially with the AC on. Had the car 2 months now, and it's been a big disapoinment. Been in for a steering rod replacement, twice. Other issues include a rattling sun roof shade, annoying vibration and hum at 2400 rpm, low quality dash, poor ergonomics with the armrests being too low. Don't get the 2.4 if you're use to a V6. You'll be disapointed. And the gas mileage averages 25 mpg for combination 70/30 hwy/city driving. I got the same with a Buick LeSabre with a 3.8 V6. Finally, lots of engine noice insid"
pontiac,g6,2008,new pontiac fan, 10/05/2008,The critics don't own the cars they rate,4,"This a great fun package, and I am one of the few around that owned the original Ford version.  MY first car 40 years ago was a rusty old ford retractable hardtop, and I was hooked.  Have had other convertibles since and own a nice 1980 corvette now.  Have never looked at Pontiac till I saw this convertible and had to have it.  3.5 v6 powerful enough and very smooth.  White diamond tri-coat with taupe leather, what a stunning car.  I knew there would be no trunk and bought it anyway instead of a mustang convertible.  Intend to keep this car for at least 10 years.   "

pontiac,g6,2008,Robert, 02/19/2009,I Bought American,2,"I bought this V 6 car based on the reviews and must say that I am most disappointed in the quality. So far the vehicle has been to the dealer 3 times for brake squeal and now there are issues related to fit and finish that have to be dealt with. As an example, the front valance does not fit properly and the grill is warped. Vehicle gets very poor gas mileage and stalls when idling (another issue that the dealer has yet to fix).  I will not be keeping this vehicle and will most likely return to a Toyota Camry. Sorry, but I gave GM a chance and they failed."
pontiac,g6,2008,BigAl, 07/11/2009,Great Bang For The Buck!,5,"I have owned many new cars (including many foreign makes) over the years including 3 previous Pontiacs with few issues. The difference between the G6 GT and the G6 GXP is night and day.  This car has it all - power, comfort, style(Street Version), fun to drive, decent gas mileage, and so far very reliable. All this at a price with the GM and Dealer discounts well below similar offerings from Toyota, Honda, et al.  Only concern is the perception that with GM dissolving Pontiac as a division the normal depreciation will accelerate greatly but as long as this car delivers I will have it a long time."
pontiac,g6,2008,HappyMama, 12/20/2009,I love My G6,5,My husband bought me a 2008 G6 for an early Christmas gift. I love it. It's fun to drive. My kids even like riding in it. There is more than enough room in the front and back for everybody to ride. The trunk is also a nice size. The stero in it has a great sound. I love that it tells me the tire pressure and if there is ice possible. I love this car and will keep it a very long time.
pontiac,g6,2008,AGP5000, 04/06/2010,Diamond in the Rough,4,"I purchased my 08 G6 GT Sedan in April 09. It had 20,000 miles on it. I must say that I have had nothing but compliments so far about the vehicle.  I have put 17,000 on it in the first year, and it has rode like a champ.  Gas mileage Avg. for me has been about 20 city/32 highway. That is a mix of city and highway.  For those who say this car has bad gas mileage, let off the gas lead foot!  It is a quick car even with a slow steady acceleration.  One recommendation to ALL OWNERS: Get a strut tower bar for the front. It improves handling, gas mpg, and reduces tire wear. I have 36.5k on the original tires, and it still has 50-60% tread life left. Recommended Cold Tire Pressures:33-35F, 30-32R."

The passenger side window leaks all the time. I have had it fixed three times already. In Nov. 09 I steering and strut went. I would never recommend Pontiac to anyone. I have looked at other cars but my payments are so cheap, plus it is pretty cool having a car that wasn't made for very long. "
pontiac,g6,2008,Nate, 07/15/2010,"Now that its gone, I miss it!",4,"I am updating my review for my G6 GT sedan. I bought it with 18k miles and it was a rental before. It had about 49k miles on it when i recently got in an accident, and it is now totaled. I had my entire family, wife, 2 kids under 18 months and a dog in the car when the accident occurred. No one was injured and air bags did not go off due to the fact that i wasn't going fast enough i think. MPG in city was around 22, and highway was around 30. I never had any big problems with it, was never in the shop for repairs, except when i hit a deer. other than that, very reliable and when friends drove it, they were impressed with it. I would get another one, but we decided on an SUV with 2 kids."

It was a fun little car to drive but not much pickup or interior space.  It was the first convertible I've ever owned. The G6 caught my eye it has 3 packages available, Premium, Sports and chrome (though a lot of the stuff seems to overlap).  After test driving it, I was hooked, its still the winter so I'm sure many dealers aren't selling convertibles right now, but having a hardtop you just feel like your driving a regular car, its not as noisy, or cold as a soft top.  I can't wait till the summer so I can enjoy this car to the max.  "

The ride is firm without being too firm, it's tight around the corners but quiet and refined over bumps in the road. The interior cabin is quiet and the stock 200 Watt stereo is excellent.

The new GXP appearance package sets the styling off, I have gotten looks by many people driving close by on the street. The car does well in everyday driving, quiet, smooth, solid; and can take off at the light with the best of them.  The 3.6L VVT and 6 speed auto is seamless.  Keep up the good work Pontiac (GM)"

I have a beautiful, bright white exterior with a two-tone black and tan interior and I couldn't have picked a better looking combination. I have never had a 4cyl engine before and it has plenty of pickup and power. The only thing I have noticed is a slight driver side window whistle on the highway. Other than that, this car is prefect. The 4- and 5- star crash ratings make this a great buy!"

pontiac,g6,2008,zro3486, 04/14/2008,Street Edition,4,"Overall, this is a great car. The Street Edition package turns heads. The ground effects kit and the scoops in the hood are gorgeous. The hammerhead spoiler is a little much, but it is starting to grow on me as time goes on. The car has plenty of power and pickup, especially since it is such a small car. I also only get about 17 mpg average between street and highway driving. I blame it mostly on low speed limits in the city I live in. On a road trip, I maintained over 25 mpg."
pontiac,g6,2008,JP, 04/20/2008,Pontiac G6,4,"I haven't had my G6 long, but I love it.  It is really fun to drive and very comfortable.  There is ample leg room in the backseat which is nice for passengers.  I love the iPod jack and the chrome trim.  They remote control start is a plus too!  I wish it had better gas mileage...but I think everyone wants better gas mileage these days.  Great car, I would recommend it.  I wish there was more storage space though or a bigger console.

Even now the little engine still runs great but unfortunately the electric power steering sensor is done, and the front end of the car requires work as well. Total quote from GM is $3300. Hardly worth the repair of a car with 316k and 12 years old so I'm trading it in. I would gladly buy another G6 if they still made them. This was an awesome car that lasted 12 years with mostly just routine maintenance.  I'm going to miss it.

Not to mention a 6'3"" guy like me fit in it perfectly. and when you sit down, it feels bigger inside than it looked from the outside. It rides nice and road noise is minimal. "
pontiac,g6,2008,eronen, 12/20/2009,fun car for the heavy leg driver,4,I enjoy the car at every aspect of it. It fast it responds well and it is reliable. I love the computer and its functions. I know I have a heavy leg on the gas but this car is very thirsty in town I get like 15 mpg and 24 mpg in a pure highway drive. I dont think any car will give you what this car is giving for the price.
pontiac,g6,2008,flat pita, 01/04/2010,Better than Camry,4,When value is important G6 wins. Very tight ride beats the Camry which was tested on the same day. The driver seat is excellent and has very good lower back support.
pontiac,g6,2008,Darcelle Strother, 08/15/2009,My G6 Convertible,4,"This is the second G6 that I have owned.  The quality is great, the performance is fantastic and I enjoy the hard top convertible.  Very sleek and classy."
pontiac,g6,2008,aregister11, 04/10/2008,Nice car but lacking important qualities,4,"Overall a nice car; comfortable, decent pick-up for a 4 cyl car, and nice radio with mp3 jack.  I think that the exterior makes the car look more expensive than it is. My big problems with this car is the lack of keyless entry and the fuel economy.  There is only one keyhole on the drivers door and it only unlocks that door-a big pain with full hands.  Also I only get about 21mpg which is a big let down to me.  I feel like I'm filling up all the time.  I'm glad it's a lease.  I miss my 06 Hyundai Elantra; it was cheaper had keyless entry and much better fuel economy. My advice - check other cars in this price range before buying, you may feel that you get more for your money."
pontiac,g6,2008,Leo Sanders, 07/25/2016,My 2008 Pontiac G6,5,Pontiac's are classic's and will never go out of style. I just feel lucky to have owned one at least once in my life! *Great Car!
pontiac,g6,2008,bvdj84, 06/11/2008,Impressed! Value!,4,"I am impressed with this car! My first American car. I came from an '06 Accord, though this car is not a Honda, it certainly upholds a good standard. I have all the options I could want, and could compare to the options of the VW Passat. Smooth ride, getting more smooth engine, not as refined as Accord. Interior is pretty nice. Great gas mileage, and finding this car to be a lot of fun!Its a happy car! Sporty looking! I got the fully loaded G6 with the 4cyl.  I am really enjoying it, I miss my Accord, but this will be fun to drive! Killer for me is the resale value, but I think Pontiac is going in the right direction! Will I be back to Honda Acura, probably, but this is fun for now! Great car"
pontiac,g6,2008,jim, 02/02/2008,Great value,4,"I bought this car two weeks ago and love it.  It looks modern and sporty.  With rebates I bought it for $14,500 plus tax and liscense.  The experts grumble about the susspension and steering, but I find both good and the car fun to drive.  Take one for a test drive instead of just reading the experts.  This car has mor space, more power, and looks better than a Civic, and it costs less."
pontiac,g6,2008,First Pontiac, 01/25/2008,What a fun car!,4,"I got the Pontiac G6 Convertible for a Sweetest Day gift! I absolutely love this vehicle! I always feel safe and secure! The car barely feels like it is turned on when you start it! It has a great ride and great look! I love turning heads in my car! I even had a police man stop me just to talk to me about my car! If you are looking for a safe and reliable car that not only has a great drive, but also makes people turn their heads, this car is for you!!"
pontiac,g6,2008,Ed Smith, 06/04/2008,My shot at better gas mileage,4,We traded a 2004 Yukon for this vehicle and thus far it has been problem free. It feels sure footed and corners nicely with little lean. It has a bit more road noise in the cabin than I care for but it is not overly annoying. The 2.4 liter engine is peppy for it's size but no wheel spinner either. Gas mileage has been fairly good at near 22 around town and running slightly above 30 mpg on the  highway. Rear seat room is above average and comfort. All in all I consider it a good buy with the c/d player radio and ON Star. I'd buy another one!
pontiac,g6,2008,kenny, 06/04/2008,Great Car.,5,"I purchased a sleek black beauty G6 GT Coupe about 2 weeks ago. I chose it over a accord coupe, altima coupe and a Mustang. This car is a head turner and is so fun to drive. Just took it on a trip to Florida and had so much fun driving it.If your looking for a nice sporty coup that avg. 31 mpg on my trip to Florida at 75mph. this is the car for you. I know I made the right decision. Also not many on the road like the other coupes. everyone loves it."
pontiac,g6,2008,Jamie, 06/13/2008,Fun to drive and turns many heads,4,"I recently bought a 2008 Pontiac G6 GXP Coupe and it is an amazing car. The street edition kit makes the car look wonderful and everyone notices it. The car is very fun to drive and handles very well on the road. Bumps are barely noticeable. The interior feels great too. If I want the car to accelerate quickly, it launches. The power is great. My only concern with the car is that it seems like it wants to idle rough a little bit at times. I'm not worried the car will leave me stranded, but a brand new car shouldn't do that."
pontiac,g6,2008,Stephanie, 06/17/2008,Awesome Pick!!,4,"I bought this car about 2 weeks ago, I find that I made a great choice, and I'm loving every minute of driving in it!. The pick up is a little slower than i thought but once it gets going, it holds you to the seat. Great for driving on the highway, not too bad fuel economy in the city. Very comfortable,and roomy. Quiet & smooth driving on the highway, and with over $7500.00 taken off the original price to make it $26,600 for the full SE package, i think i got a great price on it. "

pontiac,g6,2008,Dj1ofDet, 06/26/2008,Surprise Contender,5,"Originally I was interested in the 2008 Mazda 6, but was convinced by my wife to check out our GM discount. After being 2000 miles into driving my 2008 G6, I am completely satisfied. Not only did the G6 offer more features for the price, more incentives, and similar styling, the G6 performance (3.5 L V6) blows the Mazda 6 away! This is a crazy fun car to drive, with lots of ""off the lot"" performance and options to offer. I only wish I had purchased the GXP model for the body kit, sun and sound package for the moonroof, and leather for heated seats. GREAT VEHICLE!!!"
pontiac,g6,2008,anasanchez, 07/10/2008,so far so good,4,"I just bought my g6 this past Saturday so far so good, it has a smooth drive  nice simple basic interior the chrome makes that basic interior look good i can fit my two car seats in the back with room for one person to fit (skinny) the trunk looks small but my massage table fits in the trunk perfect.The seats are comfy and I like how it tells me how much mileage I'm getting from a full tank on the radio."
pontiac,g6,2008,Karl Swain, 07/18/2008,more power options,4,"The 2.4 L engine should have an option of being supercharged, because the 2.4 L I4 is lacking power in a big way. At low rpm it drags until you reach around 4000 rpm then it seems to finally say "" hey I'm at full throttle, let's go"" but until then grandma in her wheel chair is passing you. They either need to increase power, have a power add-on option, or just get rid of the I4 all together."
pontiac,g6,2008,Jackson, 07/29/2008,Review,5,This is a fun car to drive.  It handles well and the gas mileage is great.

pontiac,g6,2008,Lou, 10/25/2008,Excellent Quality & Value,5,"Have had the car for 4 months now. The car has been great. Runs like a top and is fun to drive. Performance is pretty good, not to mention it's getting me about 26 mpg on the average. Had a couple of minor issues and took it back to the dealership. Can't say enough about their service and personnel. Very good customer service A+. Took care of all the issues immediately and on my schedule. Overall, extremely pleased with the car and the dealership. Would highly recommend both!"
pontiac,g6,2008,Chris, 11/26/2008,G6 Surprise,4,"Bought G6 for comfortable, leather, adjustable, heated seats and nice interior layout with good quality. Car has surpassed my expectations. It's quiet, well mannered, V6 is responsive, great fuel economy at 27 avg city/highway. Car is solid with no rattles, no problems of any kind. Best car I've ever owned and I've had many of all kinds - Ford, Toyota, trucks, SUV's and sports cars. It you want a relatively inexpensive car, that is solid, somewhat fun to drive, good looking and comfortable - this is worth a look."

Owned for 15 months/28000 miles so far and only one problem -- steering gear was replaced after 3 months of ownership when it started leaking.

She took a drive in a demo vehicle and loved it immediately.  My dad bought an 06 new and has loved it so I thought it would be a good vehicle to try.  We compared it online with all the other comparable cars in its class and enjoyed this one the most.  She wanted a sunroof and 4cylinder for fuel economy so this fit the bill.  The telescopic steering wheel, cockpit feel, good looks, and smooth handling sold it for her."
pontiac,g6,2008,Avenger, 04/22/2009,Great Car!,4,"This car is light years ahead of the Grand Prix we had. Handling, acceleration and great looks make this car very fun to drive. American cars have come a long way. The editors from this website don't give this car it's due. The dash could have a bit less plastic, but the design is very good. We don't have the hood scoop and the big spoiler (don't like the spoiler). But the front grill looks great. This car is a head turner and it doesn't look like the million Nissans, Hondas and Toyotas I see everyday."
pontiac,g6,2008,Norman Potter, 04/27/2009,"My G6 Experience, so far",4,"I have owned my G6 for under a year and am already having problems. At about 7500 miles I started noticing that the brakes were becoming comparable to those of my previous vehicle, which was 13 years old. About a month ago I noticed that it starts to shake and squeak when accelerating from a dead stop. I noticed earlier this week that when driving at around 30 mph there is a squeaking noise that sounds like it is coming from the engine compartment, or possibly the wheel bearings. I currently have about 12,000 miles on it and about 90 percent of those miles are highway driving miles. The car has ran well for me so far as the only problems have been noise and shaking. As well as brake wear."
pontiac,g6,2008,Skipper, 01/14/2008,Nice vehicle,4,"I've had the vehicle about 3 months and am very satisfied with it. This car has a phenomenal stereo system and I love having steering controls for the radio. The ride is smooth, a little bumpy at times, steering is tight and comfort is nice. Overall I would recommend the vehicle. Gas mileage is my main concern on this vehicle, as I expected it to do better.  Getting around 22 in city and anywhere from 23-30 on highway. I think if the tank were larger I wouldn't feel like I was always stopping for gas.   "
pontiac,g6,2008,Orion, 07/09/2009,I Love this Car,4,"I work for a company that has me on the road a lot, usually 50 - 75K a year. They let us choose what we want to drive, we buy it finance it and they give a very fair reimbursment for the miles.   I bought the base GT with a few extras, keyless entry etc.. I have constantly gotten 32+ mpg on the highway with this car, I am also not afraid to pass with it. I have had ZERO problems with it. It had replaced a 2005 Elantra that was also a reliable car. This car ""feels"" safe you are fit and surrounded by its seat (I'm 6'1 and 190 lbs) I LOVE THE LOOKS, I LOVE THE FEEL (like a sports car) Plenty of back seat comfort (a note to GM) WHY KILL PONTIAC WHEN YOU FINALLY GOT IT RIGHT!!!!!"
pontiac,g6,2008,Ann, 07/29/2009,My dream car,4,"Fell in love with this car from the day I saw it. I did hear many complaints regarding the sunroof and water leaking from it, so I decided to go for the 2008 Coupe GT model.  I've had it for 1 month and totally love the way it drives. It has an amazing power and it's very appealing. I've had people come to ask me what kind of car it is. There're not too many G6 coupes here in FL, so it's head- turner everywhere I go. It motivates me to go anywhere!"

pontiac,g6,2008,Never Again!, 08/02/2009,Never Again!,3,"Have had nothing but issues. I take it in at least once a month to be fixed, mainly with Brakes and Power steering. Brakes replaced twice fixed four times. First set of brakes were replaced at 9,000 miles. Power steering sensor fixed once then replaced once because it would lock on me while Id drive. Feel very unsafe in this car. Dealership won't do anything for me. Trying to argue the MI Lemon Law with Pontiac Corp. Have also had issues with tire pressure. Let's just say, I will never get a GM again... doing everything I can to get out of this lease!!"
pontiac,g6,2008,Nate, 08/05/2009,G6 GT sedan (Average),3,"I panicked and traded in my 01 Tacoma TRD for this when gas was almost 5 bux/gallon in cali. I kinda regret it. It had about 28k miles when i got it, and they didn't tell me it was a had been a rental until i was signing the papers. The gas mileage is ok, i get about 18-20 in town depending how i drive, but on the 6 hr drive home, i can get 30 mpg if i stay at 65-70. I struck a deer back in jan, and the car actually held up pretty well. I am now thinking of trading it in due to pontiac goin bye bye and getting a silverado etx cab. Overall, this car isn't bad, but isn't great. I'd suggest a toyota or honda if purchasing a sedan."
pontiac,g6,2008,tom, 02/17/2008,Best Safety for the buck,4,"Bought this car for my daughter due to safety, price and looks, so happy with it we bought one for my wife three weeks ago! Love OnStar phone service and safety with all 6 airbags, rollover ratings and traction control"
pontiac,g6,2008,Mike, 09/06/2007,Sporty and affordable,4,A nice affordable 4 door sedan. The 4 cylinder is peppy but a little slow on the quick starts from a dead stop while negotiating traffic so I would allow extra time but it puts you back in the seat while passing at highway speeds. Has a a lot of nice features and safety equipment for a car in this price range. The lower corners of the rearview mirror is blocked by the back seat headrests and the blind spots are large forcing you to look over your shoulder instead of relying on the side mirrors. The buttons and knobs have a nice tactile feel to them and are easy to use. 
pontiac,g6,2008,steve, 09/05/2007,08 Pontiac g6 4dr sedan,4,"Just picked up this 08 g6 value edition over labor day weekend. I compared many cars in this segment such as Accord, Altima, Sonata, Fusion, just to name a few. This G6 had the best style and more power compared to the rest. How reliable this car will be remains to be seen only time will tell I guess. Standard OnStar and 4-wheel disk anti-lock brakes is also a big plus as well."
pontiac,g6,2008,Steve, 11/26/2007,Affordable for the Price,4,A nice car for the money. I will agree that it is difficult to see in the rear view mirror. Really peppy when passing on the interstate. Nice interior and aux. jack on the radio for the ipod/mp3. Overall a great car.
pontiac,g6,2008,Matt, 11/28/2007,Very Great Car,4,This car is great. I had a Saturn and this car is great. The design of the car is really a car that GM seems to have done right. I think that the one thing that needs to change is that keyless Remote need to come on the value package. But all in all fun to drive and looks great
pontiac,g6,2008,Alex , 03/06/2008,Excellent car,5,"This is a really good car at this price. Good exterier, fantastic stereo, good power, 100000 miles/5 years limited warranty, etc. A lot of good things. I love this car. Although somebody told me the interior is not good, I chose the light interior, and it is really great."
pontiac,g6,2008,Dan, 03/15/2008,Great car,5,"I was looking for a coupe so I checked out Nissan, Honda and Toyota. They all were ok but something just didn't feel right with any of them. I was driving past a Pontiac dealer and spotted the G6 coupe and it was love at first sight. It had everything I was looking for and more. Once I took a test drive and talked price I was sold. I paid $8-10,000 LESS than I would have paid for the Nissan, Honda or Toyota. Once I started driving it and checked my gas mpg I couldn't believe it. On the highway I'm getting 28-30 mpg and city is 23-25 mpg and it isn't even broken in yet!! As a added benefit the car is made in the USA, it looks like American workers can do a good job too."
pontiac,g6,2008,brad lebosse, 03/21/2008,Great Value,4,"I am totally impressed with my 2008 G6 value line. The 2.4L is powerful, quiet and responsive.  The 4 speed transmission is excellent. I was swayed by negative reviews about the electronic power steering but after driving the G6, I actually prefer electronic assist. Turning radius is great. I also like the large diameter steering wheel. I bought the tan interior and like the bright appearance over the black interior. Seating is comfortable and the car is quiet and fun to drive.  It is a fun car to drive and feels safe and secure. I also test drove the Honda Civic and Accord, and Toyota Camry and completely prefer the G6."
pontiac,g6,2008,Stacey, 04/03/2008,"1,500 miles",4,"A beautiful car inside and out.  It feels like driving a more expensive car.  The power adjustable pedals and seat make for a perfect fit.  I purchases the optional 18"" wheels with stability control(only $390 sticker for all)and am surprised at how aggressively the car corners.  Most of my time is spent driving sedately and the quiet ride with Monsoon system have made me enjoy driving again.  I find myself using the heated leather seats on warm days to help my lower back.  The headliner is nicely cushioned, and the two-tone interior is very visually appealing.  I look forward to the drive every time I get in this car. "
pontiac,g6,2008,dennis moore, 06/11/2016,Looks sporty but not to drive,3,"Good highway cruising,transmission balky. Outward visibility not the best. The rear end on high side which makes backing up difficult. Interior is full of hard surfaces. Has been reliable and dependable over last 4  years.

This is the one that both myself and husband felt the most comfortable in both in the front seat and as back seat passengers. The trunk space with the fold down seats that do not cover your floorspace in the back is a nice feature. It is a sedan that truly drives like a sports car."

I drive over 100 miles a day and i am averaging about 27 mpg at about 75 mph which i think is just great!

pontiac,g6,2008,Unknown Jackass, 05/21/2008,My love with the G6,5,I was recently in a car accident that wrecked my car but i got it fixed for my son as a first car i had a Ford (fix or repair daily) Taurus (that was garbage) so I went on a look for a new car and i bought a one year old at the time 2003 Pontiac Grand Prix GT and fell in love with GM so when i other car was being fixed I got a rental that was never driven before and it was a 2008 Pontiac G6 almost  loaded and i bought one 2 months ago because it was the greatest car i have driven (and my son need his car) 
pontiac,g6,2008,steve, 05/25/2008,honeymoon is over with the 08 g6,2,"Bought this 08 g6 back in sept, 2007. At about 9,000 miles the steering system broke and needed to be replaced. Then the brake rotors began to warp shortly afterwards. Service adviser told me that these are some of the common problems with the g6 and Pontiac has no plans to fix or remedy the problem. I traded in the g6 a few months ago for a Honda Civic. Thank you Honda. Buyer beware! Avoid the g6 at all costs!"
pontiac,g6,2008,Leeryleo, 05/27/2008,Unsatisfied,2,"This car is a total let down. Interior could not be any cheaper. Other than the cheap cloth (?) seats everything seems to be hard plastic. Now that the weather is warming up the inside has a awful plastic smell. The fuel mileage is terrible. We had to have the tie rods replaced in less than 2000 miles. Car hesitates while driving, lack of useful accessories, and very cheap paint job. We hate this new car."

pontiac,g6,2008,KD Mann, 10/05/2020,A vastly under-rated hard-top convertible w/3.9L,5,"No, our Pontiac G6 GT convertible is not on par with a $50,000 Infiniti G37, but as hardtop convertibles go there is not anything better even at twice the price.  If you are looking for a low-cost used convertible, don't buy anything before you drive one of these!

We were looking for a retractable hard-top convertible under $15,000, mostly for my wife ;-).  

Previously she'd owned a VW Jetta, and we'd just sold her Infiniti G35xS Sedan.  She (we)  liked both cars, so we test drove the G37 and the EOS.  We were underwhelmed with the EOS. We were very impressed with the G37 but not surprised because it is nearly identical to the G35.  Then we found a 2008 G6 GT and figured 'what the heck, it's half the price of the G37 and it has the  optional 3.9L six...let's drive it and see...'.   

Wow..the G6 blows away the VW EOS on so many levels.  The german-built Karmann retractable hard-top in the Pontiac is much more smooth and solid than VW's, and the Karmann top mechanism seems as good or better than the one in the G37.  (Note, Pontiac and Karmann made some improvements to the retractable top mechanism for 2008, so I would try to find a 2008-2010 model).  The V6 engines (especially the LZ9 3.9L) are, in a word, SATISFYING.  The low end torque is great, the sound is mellow with just the right amount of rumble to the exhaust and the car is more than fast enough...but without ever feeling whiney or buzzy like the EOS. The front-drive G6 is not as fast or sporty feeling as the rear-wheel drive G37, but the G6 feels much more like the G37 than the EOS. 

What I think is most surprising about the G6 is how 'German' it feels, but it turns out that the car really IS German -- it is based on GM's 'epsilon' platform that was designed in Germany by Opel.  Other cars based on the the same platform are the Saab 9-3, Cadillac Catera, Opel Insignia and a whole bunch of other well regarded vehicles.  Look up 'epsilon platform' on wikipedia for more details.

The G6 convertible was a joint project between Opel and Karmann and it is surprisingly well executed -- almost unbelievable considering the original prices for these cars were under $30,000. 

The G6 GT has a gorgeous body, areal head-turner -- the EOS by comparison looks mundane and boring.  In the end it was probably the design and visual appeal that hooked us.

One of the complaints about the G6 sedans and coupes that reviewers noted back in 2006/07 when these came out was the interior seemed 'plastic-ey', but except for the glove-compartment door, we don't share that impression in our GT Convertible.  Twelve years and 80,000 miles later the interior of our car is quite beautiful with almost no rattles or buzzing. All of the controls, handles and levers are very high quality with great feel, especially the parking brake lever (VERY beefy and nice), radio/electronics/climate controls and the air-conditioning vents (these are easily the best and smoothest of any car we've owned).  I rate all of these as equal or better than what we had in our up-scaled Infiniti G35xS, and also better than what we saw in the EOS.  Ergonomics in the G6 are also uniformly excellent. 

Another complaint was that the gussets and braces that Opel/Karmann added to the G6 coupe didn't go far enough in stiffening the chassis.  Here I will agree, with the top down on a rough/bumpy road I find myself slowing down because the chassis flex is a little unnerving.  Better than many convertibles, but I would have preferred the extra stiffness even if it would have added another 300lbs to the car's weight.

That said, the Karmann and Opel designed hardtop is an engineering marvel -- it stiffens the car to a surprising extent when the top is up, and then the G6 GT not only looks like a coupe, it 'feels' like a coupe.  Very solid.  

Here's a real bonus -- the eight-speaker 400w ""Monsoon"" audio system in the G6 GT is
 unbelievably great.  It is substantially better than the optional Bose system that we had in our 2008 Infiniti G35xS, and is WAY better than the 2009 G37 convertible audio.  The Monsoon audio system performs far beyond my expectations, especially for a convertible, which is a notoriously difficult problem for audio engineers to solve.  The junk that was in the EOS wasn't even close and I'm not sure we could have 'fixed' it even if we'd spent $3,000 in aftermarket upgrades.  One beef with the G6 audio system -- the big subwoofers in the doors cause some resonance vibrations that make the rearview mirrors get blurry when you have the bass cranked up...but as a former audio engineer I can probably fix that.  Normal people don't listen as loud as I do so this might not bother you.

The bottom line is that we're surprisingly delighted with this car.  Our only dilemma is what we are going to do with the extra $8,000 we didn't spend on the G37 convertible...

pontiac,g6,2009,arden3, 06/20/2018,It's been an excellent 8 years,5,"I've owned my GXP since it was a year old, originally a rental.  It's not given me any major issues or problems.  I take care if it, including changing the full synthetic oil every 3-4k miles and using premium gas most of the time.  It never hesitates to take off like a rocket when needed.  It handles well and rides quietly with a decent set of tires.  Only thing that has happened recently (about 130k miles) was a small leak in the cooling system that I haven't had a chance to check out yet.  Besides that, the 3.6L is bullet proof and has been a great car for 8 years now.

pontiac,g6,2009,PontiacG6, 10/20/2010,Best Car Ever!,4,"I wasn't planning on getting a G6 but when we test drove one at the dealership I fell in love with it. It rides so amazingly, it has every feature I would want and more. The inside is so roomy and it is very sleek looking. It looks great on the outside too. It only gets about 21 mpg but to be honest I could car less because I just love it so much. Seriously best car I have ever owned, too bad Pontiac was discontinued."
pontiac,g6,2009,pjz3, 04/08/2012,Great car for the money,4," I recently purchased a used 2009 pontiac G6 with 33,000 miles. I really wasn't looking for a G6 but when I saw this one and test drove it I couldn't pass it up. All the other cars I test drove in this price range,(between 10,000 and 15,000),didn't even compare. The ther cars lacked in accesories or were much smaller and under powered. The G6 with everything I was looking for in a car plus nice styling and handling. The horse power from the 2.4L ecotec engine won't win any drags but it's no slouch oh the hiway. My family and i took the G6 on a short 200 mile trip just to see how it would do. We only used a Quarter tank of gas the whole trip. Over all a great little car."
pontiac,g6,2009,bobandsherry, 03/27/2009,Fun to Drive,4,"Wife wanted a convertible, moving from Infiniti G35 coupe. She wanted hard top so that really limited selection. No, the G6 isn't a G35, but it also costs about 30-35% less. That said, the G6 is still plenty car to get person from point A to point B with plenty of pick-up and go.  In Midwest, being able to drive in snow is even more a necessity than dropping the top in summer, G6 handles GREAT in snow with stock tires. G6 is sporty, functional and fun to drive - can't wait for summer. No problems."
pontiac,g6,2009,nad, 02/21/2010,ooh no!!!!!!!!!!!,2,"I bought an 09 G6 GT currently 28400 miles and today it went dead and wouldn't start.   I had to call ONSTAR to the rescue, but the tow truck company wouldn't give me a ride so I had to call a friend to get home.  A anti theft symbol a (car and lock) showed up on my dash as I was driving along and then my speedometer went crazy and I pulled off the highway thinking I was going to go down and as I expected it wouldn't start again when I shut down."
pontiac,g6,2009,partsman99, 06/20/2012,"A decent ""cheap"" car",3,"This is a decent car. Not a fan of all the plastic everywhere, and the very thin hollow sound of the doors when you close them, but other than that not a bad car. Key fobs = terrible! They're expensive, and do not last long. The 3.5L has more than enough power, and never ceases to amaze me. Car is VERY quiet; you can barely hear the engine rev. Excellent fuel economy: hwy averages around 28, with as much as 36 on a long road trip. The controls are easy to read, and arranged well. The seats start to get uncomfortable after 5 hours in on a road trip. In short, if you are looking for basic transportation that is dependible and capable of passing slower cars, this is a good choice. "

I got it about a month later and it came with (black/tan heated leather, power moonroof, spoiler, 17' polished 5 spoke rims, 3.5L V6, AM/FM/XM/CD/AUX radio, Monsoon speaker system, power seat) When I got it I was very surprised. The exterior is beautiful! The interior is very nice too. I took it home and was in shock to find out how well this car handled! The suspension is taught yet soft at the same time! The steering feels like a German sports sedan! It currently has 23K miles on it and has given me no problems at all! I get it professionally detailed every 3 months I detail it myself in between. I love it so much!"

I took my car to the dealership to have the recalled part repaired in March of 2012.
Two days after the repair I start experiencing problems with my steering and my power steering went out a week later.
After searching the internet i found out that this is a huge problem for this model.
I then called Pontiac and they opened a case for this issue.
i was advised to take my car to my local dealer and if they advise that it was not due to wear and tear or lack of matianence then they would assist with reimbursement.
I took my car to the dealer and was advised that the torque sensor was bad."

Bought it used with 40k in June 2010 and after a week noticed that the carpet in the back was wet. Thought it was a seal in the door but a few weeks later I had over an inch of water in the back. STILL having problems a year later! Driver headlight doesn't work, I've had the bulb replaced and wiring tightened, still comes on and off at random.
Brake lights stay on all the time, except when I'm USING my brakes! Had the brakelight switch replaced and still not working properly. The silver/chrome interior is peeling and looks horrible. Had a 1999 grand prix that I loved and this car has definitely been a disappointment!!!"

I just bought this used former rental '09 G6 coupe with leather, sunroof, and alloys a couple months ago for pretty cheap.  I have to disagree with the Edmunds review.  I love it.  The exterior coupe looks sporty, the leather seats are comfortable and have good support, and it rides like a dream.  I am getting 27 mpg mixed driving with the V6 3.5.  I love the power.  It feels good to drive an American car that has a lot of power, gets good gas mileage, and is fun to drive.  "

Ours has the 2.4 L 4 cyl and 6 speed auto trans, it gets in the low 30's on long distance trips, mid 20's around town 50/50 mix of fwy and city driving. No major issues so far, most recent problem has been some brake issues, but seems to be solved with new pads. The turn signal stalk came loose, replaced under warranty. Only other issue, a speck of rust has started on the trunk lid, will be repaired under warranty also. The car has a muffled rattle in the headliner, our Malibu had one too. This car was loaded up with all of the stuff you could get on a 4 cyl model. It's a keeper."

Since the test drive I have fallen head over heels for this car. The performance is great, it handles very well and smoothly in all situations.  Also it has been very reliable and dependable for me. I was also happily surprised to discover its fuel economy is nothing to frown at either.  Overall this car has many perks and great aspects to it."

pontiac,g6,2009,Chief Pontiac, 04/11/2019,Owned for 10 years,4,"The car is hitting 70,000 plus mostly highway miles.  In that time, I've experienced the cruise control coming off and the constant brake light problem 3 times that was covered under a recall which amounted to pulling the blue cables from the computer and hitting the pin holes with di-electric grease which I keep in the glove compartment at all times.  I just had to replace the remote mirror switch was $48 on Amazon and took 10 minutes.  I also had to replace the turn signal lever a couple of years ago because the thin metal strip inside that switch was fatigued.  That was $23 on Amazon.  It still looks and drives great."
pontiac,g6,2009,angelajoe, 01/24/2011,Crap on four wheels,3,"We bought this car used only had a few thousand km on it. Since then we have found that the rims and tires are hard to get.
The car is to low in winter this causes damage.
Now cylinder 5 has a missfire and the plug broke off in the engine just completly siezed in the engine.
Also the front brakes are wearing out prematurly would get rid of it but owe to much on it to trade it in but in a year i will be going ford this car is a total dissapointment.
Way to much plastic and the interior feels and looks cheap but the outside looks okay."

pontiac,g6,2009,mbk, 07/12/2009,does it really matter anymore,3,"I guess I'm a little heart broken at the lack of quality materials in the interior of the G6. The leather is so thin, I'm almost afraid to touch it. The fact that the sports package included only half electric seats and a horrible handle to move the seats back and forth just floors me. I drove a 99 Olds Intigue GLS with all the bells and whistles, this just doesn't compare. Why did I buy it, Classic exterior look, great engine,good deal for the money,and the fact that GM is GM, and I wanted to stay American with some style."

This car's 3.6 liter engine is FAST, its sporty looks get loads of compliments and it averages as much as 27.5 mpg on the highway and 22 mpg overall! The car handles well, has a satisfying but not obtrusive engine note and came fully equipped with leather interior, moonroof,auto climate control, 6 CD changer, power  driver's seat and 6 speed auto/manual trans. For all this, I paid under $21,800! Too bad GM killed Pontiac; this car was a sleeper!"
pontiac,g6,2009,Mar, 07/11/2010,This is a good car,4,"I purchased the 09 G6 as a replacement for my  07 G6 as the 07 was stolen and totaled. If for a minute I didn't loke the 07 model, I never would have purchased the 09. It is a good looking car and fun tho drive. It has enough power with the 3.5 V6 and handles good. I am so mad that GM stopped making Pontiac. I have owned Pontiac for the last 20+ years, and will miss them. I am still a GM guy, I just have to decide where to go next in the GM family. I remember on a 500 mile trip, I got 30.2 MPG and did not go under 55 MPH, spending much of the time at 70MPH and more. I was impressed with that. OnStar and navigation are useful also. I recommend this car to all!"
pontiac,g6,2009,dner, 11/23/2010,Better than expected,4,"We needed a winter car as our Mercedes is rear wheel drive.  Normally we drive luxury or sporty cars or suvs. We picked this G6 because we like front drive cars on ice or slick roads. We have 2 suvs for deeper snow. For the money this is a nice car. Comfortable, reasonable performance, great economy, decent grownup looks. The seat are nice and I like the Onstar, ipod hookup, traction control and the ride. Quieter and nicer riding than I expected."

All I know at this point is that it's a base model 2.4 motor it runs alittle rough in the morning but smoths out when it gets worm. I changed the tire size to 235/55-17 and it looks great with the wider tires, my wife wants me to paint it red she hates the white.
Is there anything I can do to give it more HP??
I would like to find a rear wing for it (used)
if anyone has one email me. 
Thanks for reading."

It now has 98,000 miles on it, and the only trouble has been intake/exhaust solenoids (due to letting the fuel level sink below the red area and sucking up deposits from the bottom of the gas tank, and the left front wheel bearing/hub going bad. Fuel economy is around 25 mpg. Everything still works, with no issues. We got our money's worth, and gave it to our kid. Still not using any oil between changes (every 3,000 miles since we bought it). We have the 2.4L four cylinder engine.

No problem with engine and transmission.
But little things like window regulator and suspension was horrible.  replaced all the front suspension parts.
However I had 5 Pontiacs so far.  Reliable powertrain and transmission and looking good.
If somebody wants as first car for their kids, this isn't bad.  If you want top quality lasting 300,000 without trouble, this is not it.   However I just like Pontiac styling.,

I normally drive an 2007 Audi a4 and given my A4 only cost me about 5k more then a new G6 GT it feels about 100% better in terms of interior quality, handling and overall build quality.

pontiac,g6,2009,Oldfield, 09/15/2009,Pontiac builds excitement,5,"Only owned the car for six weeks but it has been great so far. The relatively long wheelbase, for a car in this class, provides excellent ride. Owing to the fat 225/50-17 tires, taunt but compliant suspension and good steering response I, admittedly not a street racer, haven't found the limits of this car, yet. From what I've experienced, however, I expect the G6 to perform well in an emergency evasive maneuver. I'm 6'2"" and found the back seat headroom to be adequate and the legroom quite impressive. Originally attracted by the clean, smooth styling and rake of the roofline. Really like the taupe leather interior, heated seats and security of OnStar. 31 mpg so far on a couple trips."

The gas mileage is good considering I don't break 35 mph on my 4 mile drive to work.   The interior leaves a lot to be desired....way too much plastic. And I wish the seats sat up straighter.  They need one more notch to sit up all the way.  One other thing....There are too many cup holders in the car too.  I'd rather have an armrest in the back.  LOVE the exterior....especially the back!

Its a 3.5 liter V6 and it provides a lot of pep! The exterior styling is classy, yet sporty. The monsoon stereo sounds great. My only gripe is the interior build quality. There is too much hard plastic, and the doors sound very cheap when you open and close them. Some switches and controls are loose or seem very fragile. Also, the shifter feels cheap going in and out of gear. Lack of cargo space for storage too. "

There's just so many things you can do to it that you can't do with other cars or is a lot harder in other cars.  Bought the car for $5.5k back in late Nov of '14 with 81k miles on it and sold it to the insurance company in the summer of '17 for $6k after a hail storm.  I no major issues with car throughout my time with it other than the air conditioning which didn't work when i bought the car but didn't realize until the summer.

The G8 is Pontiac's 7-series sized, 5-series handling, 1-series priced, 3-series BMW.  With time it would have gone from a very good car to a great car.  GM dropped the ball, big time, when they canceled the Pontiac brand.  I only hope that they will bring the Australian Beast back.  Regardless what brand it would fall under, or what they called it, I would purchase another one.  Out of the 20 vehicles I've owned, the G8 one is by far my favorite.  It doesn't matter if I'm looking at her in my garage, detailing her, or drifting her around some corners, she always brings a big smile to my face."
pontiac,g8,2008,Rico, 07/10/2008,4-Door HOT ROD,5,"I replaced my 2005 Ford Mustang with the G8 GT. Much more room for my kids, performance and even gas mileage. The G8 is an incredible buy. I don't think I would change anything about this car.  Most of the reviews I have read it seems people really don't like the oil/volt display.  That really doesn't bother me. Otherwise, great performance, great seats, great rear legroom, great trunk and good looks all around. Nice work Pontiac! I would suggest if you are looking at this car at least do a test drive and go in with an open mind. If you look at this car like any other old Pontiac you will definitely sell yourself short!"
pontiac,g8,2008,Scott, 09/17/2009,Aggressive!,5,"I traded in my 2006 CTS-V for this car. While the V was definitely much faster, the G8GT is very aggressive and a very comfortable sedan. Overall, only a slight concession at half the price. I frequently travel I75 in Florida, this car cruises VERY nice at speeds of 80-85 mph. I have driven this car in excess of 120 mph a few times and it stills tracks nicely without vibration or float. Cars are my weakness and have had many - this 2008 G8GT is probably my overall favorite. I have removed all the badges on the car and people often ask what kind of car it is. ""that looks great"" and ""I never heard of that"" are usually the comments made. Lots of bang for the buck!!!!"
pontiac,g8,2008,ilpilgrim, 06/21/2015,Great car great beast!,5,I owned this car from 21k miles other than oil changes and regular maintenance the car is great couldn't have asked for a better car now with 91k miles... I have drove it from san diego to rhode island with no issues at all its made the trip 3 times now which is some good miles can't beat the speed of the car it sounds great handles like a BMW with out decals most wouldnt know it's a damn pontiac lol can't go wrong with this beast has speed 0_60 in about 5.1 and all for under 18k now day...so if you are looking for a reliable car that has the looks and speed to match!
pontiac,g8,2008,G8 888, 05/15/2008,G8 is CAR,5,"This car is amazing! I just picked up my new Ignition Orange G8 GT!  The only thing I don't like is the panel gap between the hood and the grill, but to me, it kinda adds toughness to it!  This car can smoke any ""competition"" any day of the week!  "
pontiac,g8,2008,David, 05/18/2008,You would be MAD not to love it,4,"After looking at all the pros and cons I decided the pros won out. This car is not only comfortable, refined, with great handling it is also economical, at least on highways. However if you use your right foot to much the gas mileage will suffer. The performance is unbelievable when you push the gas pedal, it just forces you back in the seat. At a constant 70 mph the mpg is around 28. Good job GMC "
pontiac,g8,2008,Rod, 05/26/2008,Awesome,4,"I was in my early 20's in the 70's Muscle car era.  I had some of the best. The G8 GT brings back the thrill of driving that those cars gave back then.  You know you have some thing special when a sheriff's Deputy follows you for 4 mile just to ask you how you like the car, and BMW 5 series driver parks next to you so he can get a close look at the G8.  The car is very comfortable, and am still getting use to where all the switches are but so far has been a great experience.  Mine is Panther Black, and with the stance of the G8 I have nick named it VADER. "
pontiac,g8,2008,Razz, 05/26/2008,Why,4,"I don't know why I bought this car. The V6 was plenty good. Tested the Charger, Mustang V6 & GT, Accord, Civic, Sonata and been in many others during my search over the last year.  The BMW sure is nice but I think my friend will be disappointed when he sees the G8 GT for half the price. If you keep under 65 you get remarkable 25-27 MPG. It eats gas just idling. 15 is no problem in the city.  First impressions: besides the tough look and motor is the front interior,and excellent seats. Warmers work great and no need for extra lumbar support. Handles good and is very fast.  Reminds me of the Catalina I had with the special 400 plus motor that was ordered from the factory."
pontiac,g8,2008,gunter, 07/28/2008,1st Pontiac,4,"Traded an 04 Tahoe on the car and have been quite pleased to date. The v-6 has plenty of moxie with just the right amount of cool in the styling. The fuel mileage could be closer to 30+ I would think, being it has a 5 speed auto. The rest of the car is still so new to us that we are still figuring out items. At first blush the one thing that sticks out to me is the tilt wheel. Seems it could have been more akin the tilts in pick ups and suv type vehicle. Not much range of motion, especially when one is in egress mode. Getting in and out is a bit challenging. I was also a bit leery about  buying a vehicle that had the (odd size) wheels. Here's hoping the tires wear well. Expensive.        "
pontiac,g8,2008,Dave, 12/19/2008,4 Door Vette,4,"This car is big, heavy, fast, but stops and handles well. It has good sight lines. The interior has annoying features like the oil battery gauge and air bag light on mirror. No satellite radio was available. It is a joy to drive, easy to park, and smoooth! Remote start and climate control are a big plus. The driver's wiper was annoying. I used a shorter blade to solve the tapping issue. A lot of car for 30 grand! It really gets 18mpg daily and I am not cautious."
pontiac,g8,2008,very happy man!, 05/20/2008,very happy man!,5,"I bought this car in Philly and i live 2.5 hrs north of that.  It is AWESOME, mine is liquid red with black and red leather interior.  I actually stayed overnight at a hotel in Philly and waited for this one to come in with every feature you could get.  It drives like is has a grip to the road like no other, I test drove a BMW 3 and 5 series, a CTS and a LEXUS and this ONE came out on TOP! I lOVE THE HORSEPOWER!"
pontiac,g8,2008,Andrew G, 05/25/2008,Wonderful Automobile!,4,"I went to the dealer to purchase a G6 GT sedan after looking at many other mid-sized vehicles.  While waiting for the sales person, my wife and I looked at a G8 sedan parked on the lot.  One test drive later, we were driving it home.  I purchased this car for work (sales) where I drive hundreds of miles daily.  With all of the freeway work being done and a particularly harsh winter, the roads are brutal but the G8 does a nice job of smoothing out the bumps without sacrificing a tight, controlled ride and excellent handling.  Plus, my clients, many of them 6'+, are very comfortable in the back seat.  The styling is also very sporty without looking ""boy-racer""- ish.  Nice job, Pontiac!"
pontiac,g8,2008,W3ldon, 05/27/2008,"I love my ""Yak""",5,"OK.  I just got my black on black G8 two weeks ago and I am crazy about it.  I took my wife to the Westin in it and the valet was like ""Hey, man, what is this?"" I was like, ""this is the car that better stay parked tonight.""  He loved it.  Everywhere I go, I get stares. Their eyes are saying, ""Wow!"" and then they see a Pontiac badge and they fall over.  ""That's a Pontiac?""  Yep, a Pontiac.  I can't get mad at 'em.  Thats the exact thing I said just two weeks before I saw one on the road and bought one.   This car is amazing.  It good on gas for a V8, It is very quick and I'm going to have to get some tires in about 6 mos because, damn"
pontiac,g8,2008,Lloyd Carder, 03/27/2008,Rental car like,2,"We purchased the G8 and was excited the the rear wheel drive would give the ride and feel of a classic American car.  Instead the car rides like a go Kart is jumpy off the line and has a gas pedal like a tractor.  The speedometer and Tach are covered by you hands at 10 and 2 leaving the digital speedometer to be stared at before you can focus to see what the faint red number says.  The shifter slips into Neutral if you rest your hand on the shifter.  The rear view mirror requires you to flip a lever, not a problem but the mirror has so many buttons for OnStar and other gadgets that you are always hitting them.  We are selling the car after only 250 miles at a 6K loss to just get rid of it.  "
pontiac,g8,2008,g6- 2 door coupe, 09/25/2010,The lemon,1,"The car had been in the shop several time handles poorly in the snow. Tires are very expensive to replace. The brake light was on when driving - did not know it until a state trooper followed me. I would say that 36,000 miles was the life before every thing began to break down and then lets not mention the warranty was up after that and obama motors did not have a stimulus for the replacing the warranty of the car, how about that for a change!"

pontiac,g8,2008,George Kruk , 10/22/2009,The Problems I've Had with any Pontiac,3,"I've had my car in the shop now 6 times to fix the front suspension. There is a huge clunking noise whenever I go over bumps. The entire front suspension has been replaced (1 control arm, both struts and all the linkage) and the problem is still there. Did I mention that I only have 30K miles on the car. I miss my 2004 Grand Prix GTP, hands down a better car. As soon as the suspension is fixed I am getting rid of this car. "
pontiac,g8,2008,Sean, 03/16/2008,#607 of 888,4,"I just picked up my G8 GT today. It's #607 of the original 888 made by Holden (actually has a Holden VIN #). Amazing car. Fun to drive, beautiful to look at it. Between the stares driving home, and the neighbors all coming around to tell me how amazing it looks, it's certainly a winner. So far so good!"
pontiac,g8,2008,Gene, 05/30/2008,Just Gets Better,4,"Posted earlier after owning only 3 days. The car just gets better as does the mpg as it breaks in. Haven't been on any lengthy trips yet but assume it will get much better. As lots of others said, this car turns heads. Found that I'm not alone in thumbs down of oil pressure and battery. Liked another reviewers idea of pictures displayed there. I would prefer to see MPG or anything else displayed here. Would be even better if you could select from DIC what you want there."
pontiac,g8,2008,L Wheeler, 06/01/2008,"I love my G8, but hate Blaupunkt",4,"For the money, my G8 smokes everything else in its class.  It puts a smile on my face every time I put my foot in it.  I test drove the Cadillac CTS, and really wanted to buy it, but couldn't justify the extra $10K."
pontiac,g8,2008,Rod, 06/04/2008,GM got this one right.,4,"The G8 has every thing one would want in a car.  It has awesome performance, great looks, comfort, great road feel. One of the things that impressed me the most was the reaction from the mechanics I work with.  Even our resident cynic thinks the car is awesome (he finds flaws in every car but none in my G8 GT).  T The G8 is a very solid feeling car, the ride is not for luxury ride lovers, it is to firm and handling very responsive. "
pontiac,g8,2008,Rod, 06/08/2008,Two weeks later,4,"It has been two weeks since I wrote my first review on the G8 GT.  The fuel mileage has gone up 2 mpg from tank one to tank 3.  This car gets more comments about how great it looks and impresses more people than the first car I had that was super impressive, and that was a 1970 Hemi Cuda.  It is also as much fun to drive as the Cuda, and handles way better.  In one review someone commented about no release for the gas filler door.  The gas door lock is part of the door lock system.  If the doors are locked the gas door is locked.  I like that don't have to pull a lever, just make sure the doors are unlocked, and who locks their doors when they are at the gas pump. you know you are being robbed."
pontiac,g8,2008,rich, 06/09/2008,Did i pay too much?,4,"I bought a red g8gt last week.  List with options was $31,345. I got it for $30,000 even.  I was expecting more of a discount, this close to year end. So far my questions/gripes - weird noises when you put it in reverse, especially from the steering gear and rear suspension.  No satellite radio available.  Faux carbon fiber dash doesn't like Armour all.  The seat controls are chintzy.  The radio off button isn't on the knob.  Interior is a bit dark and depressing.  Acceleration and braking are terrific though.  The paint is normal red, not metallic?"
pontiac,g8,2008,big bill, 06/09/2008,a four door mustang?,4,"I traded in a 2008 mustang GT with about 6,000 miles on for the G8 GT.  it has nearly the same acceleration (but not the same exhaust note), much more room, and a less tacky (but still not sophisticated) dashboard. I like this vehicle but there are a lot of things done wrong - see suggested improvements below."
pontiac,g8,2008,Aka, 06/17/2008,"Simply an Awesome Car, made for driving",4,"I chose the V6 3.6 because it is absolutely strong and fast enough from me and I don't need extra 110 horses in the stables... The car is simply a fun car to drive, easily comparable with BMW driving qualities and performance. The gear is great, sporty if necessary. The engine has plenty of torque and it pulls great almost in any situation. It is huge on the inside, plenty of leg room for everyone. The luggage space is also huge and can carry two strollers easily. I highly recommend it for people who like a sporty, yet family friendly car. one warning, the base models don't provide extra gadgets or sophisticated hi-fi, it is quite basic, I like it that way, except for changing the speakers."
pontiac,g8,2008,KLester, 06/18/2008,G8-Pontiac got it right,4,"This car is a GTO/Olds 442 throw back. Great acceleration, exceptional handling. Good fuel economy. I get approx 25 mpg. Practical family car."
pontiac,g8,2008,aldinero, 06/19/2008,Poor man's bmw,4,"Great car to drive. Ride and handling as good as it gets. Very comfortable seating. Steering is precise very good brakes. Radio only fair, controls somewhat confusing and seat back control knob hard to reach. Overall a competitive performance car."
pontiac,g8,2008,Jessica, 06/23/2008,Amazing!,4,I bought this car 3 weeks ago and absolutely feel in love! It is the hottest car on the road. My fiance and I went out to eat and had a crowd of people stop and just want to look at what it was. No one has a clue that Pontiac has made such an outstanding car. THANKS GM!!!
pontiac,g8,2008,Rod, 06/25/2008,Have had one month and 3rd review,4,"It has been a month since I bought my G8 GT.  I thought right after I bought it, ""Gas prices are going out of site, what did I do?""  The answer after thinking about it and a month with the G8, I don't need steak every night, hot chili and hot dogs are just fine. The fun of driving a real car that has great performance, is more fun at age 61 than a Japanese car that gets 30+ mpg.  The fact that what ever situation I get in I can get out of.  Can a Honda Civic that is stock accelerate out of a situation?  Hell no. Or stop as fast as the G8.  There is more to a car than gas mileage.  Ability to handle any situation with power brakes or acceleration can save your life."
pontiac,g8,2008,Buckeye 350, 06/30/2008,Great Performance Buy,4,"I replaced my 2005 Grand Prix GXP with the G8 GT.   Much better room inside, performance and even gas mileage.   The G8 is an incredible buy.   All I would change is 1) add XM radio option 2) get rid of the Atari instrumentation in the center of the dash and replace with the Grand Prix driver info center and 3) get rid of the annoying passenger seat belt warn lights on the rear view mirror.   Otherwise, great performance, great seats, great rear legroom, great trunk and mighty fine looking overall.   Nice work Pontiac!"
pontiac,g8,2008,Rob, 07/03/2008,"Love to drive, hate to fill-up",4,"Had it for three weeks.  Still can't wait to get in and drive it.  Extremely impressive performance, great stereo, slick looks, but unimpressive gas mileage - 17/24 mpg.  Ad says ""V6 Fuel Economy""...mis-leading to say the least.  My daily driver is a '00 Bonneville that gets 25/32 with the 3.8 L V6.  I bought it for the overall value and ""driving excitement"", not the mileage. Had a tough time deciding between G8 and Charger R/T. I think I made the right decision. Beware, gas cap door blew off in the automatic car wash!  Dealer wants $80 to repaint it.  I say it is a design flaw."
pontiac,g8,2008,Franchise, 07/16/2008,the g8 is gr8,4,"Great car, very fast, big enough for a big guy (6'-4"" size 18 shoes) to fit very comfortably. It feels a little less powerful than it actually is until you realize how much faster your going than everyone around you, its pretty smooth for a car that handles well and accelerates so fast. It would be nice if they would make a less expensive, stripped down coupe version of the G8 that could fill the void where the firebird used to be, the solstice just doesn't cut it with no v8 and being so small a 5th grader can barely get in it"
pontiac,g8,2008,JUNIOR, 07/18/2008,G8 GT THE CORVETTE OF LARGE/MID SEDANS,4,This car is very beautiful in the exterior design. The fenders around the wheel area are amazing. The aerodynamic feel to it is great. The upshift is smooth as possible. The gas mileage is much of a concern when you know what your getting into (G8). The interior is also awesome. No Navigation or XM radio but the thing is that you are going to have to pay for XM after your first year. And you can a navigation anywhere. The Red Digital Battery thing is okay not the greatest but its not the biggest of concerns in the fun car matter.
pontiac,g8,2008,G8GT6969, 07/27/2008,Love this car1,4,"Not much to say ,except this car is incredible!!! As I am continue to put more miles on it(break it in!!), it's becomes more and more fun. I did my first hard takeoff yesterday.! Amazing!! Mind you, I've been driving a Dodge neon for the past 4 years, so It really feels impressive."
pontiac,g8,2008,"8 ""s in the blood", 08/01/2008,"You got to be kidding, don't tell anyone",4,"This car is a winner, I got it for my wife because she wanted a sports car and I couldn't afford the vette, and she can't drive a stick, so it was this, the black gt, she can't stop driving it long enough for me to go somewhere in it. Awesome. By the way you can get a locking fuel cap, I used my old 96 astro cap it works."
pontiac,g8,2008,Monstrgrn, 08/01/2008,You gotta get one of these,4,"I've owned imports and German cars my entire life.  I can't believe I looked at a Pontiac and bought it. Seriously, I know there are lots of people out there like me reading this,  this is a fantastic car you would be a fool to ignore it you are looking at BMW. Mercedes, Infiniti, Lexus. etc.  Go drive one and tell me I'm wrong.  This is not the plastic fantastic Pontiac that I remember!  It is a refined truly remarkable machine that will blow the doors off of 98 percent of the cars on the road today.  Buy one and have some fun, you know you want to."
pontiac,g8,2008,Hilbilly, 08/02/2008,Why buy a BMW?,5,"I am really impressed with my Pontiac G8-GT. It's a real rocket but it doesn't guzzle gas. It holds five easily, although I rarely ever have more than two of us in it. Most important, is the fact that it does everything my friends BMW 550 does at half the price. I was really impressed with how well it's built and how solid it feels on the road. It handles very well and imparts a sense of confidence when I drive it. I guess if you need the snob appeal of a BMW then spend the extra $30K otherwise this G8-GT is a great buy. I had one of the first GTO's and this reminds me of it."
pontiac,g8,2008,Rod, 08/10/2008,After 3 months,4,I have had my G8 GT for almost w months know and the more I drive it the more I love it.  Getting use to where all the switches are and comfortable with it.  Only big expense besides gas has been a oil change.  8 quarts of Mobil 1 are not cheap. The more I drive this car the more impressed I am with it.  Merging into freeway traffic can be almost frightening.  Any thing more than 1/4 throttle and you are going from 45 mph to 80 mph in about two heartbeats. Even after 3 months it is still hard to get more than 16 mpg.  I think that has something to do with that thing Pontiac puts under your right foot.  It keeps sucking your foot to the floor and putting a smile on your face.  LOL 
pontiac,g8,2008,Brian Sharrett, 08/18/2008,Great Purchase,4,"I bought this car to replace my 04 Mustang Cobra. I really needed more room. This auto provides that and more! The performance is very good overall for the size and weight of the car. A lot of people complain about ""Atari type gauges"" but you do get used to them. After owning and driving this car for three month's, I realize, I have made a great purchase and I am not looking back!"
pontiac,g8,2008,Rod, 08/21/2008,Month 4 with a G8 GT,4,"Starting month 4 with the G8.  I am getting comfortable with all of the switches.  This car has proven that all of the press hype is not hype, it is fact.  It is the best value that any car manufacturer has on the market for the price.  If you want a real car, with real performance, room and quality this is the car. You can spend twice the money and get something like and buy a 5 series BMW, or you can buy the G8 GT get the same performance and have lots of money left over to bay the person at the gas pump.  I love American Iron so I will pay at the gas pump instead of at the dealer.  I vote to make Australia the 51st state."
pontiac,g8,2008,carman, 08/23/2008,Awesome car,5,Excited to drive again. Look for reasons to go to the store. This car reminds me of how exciting it was to get into your first car.
pontiac,g8,2008,JohnnySacks, 08/26/2008,"Finally, GM RWD",4,"Waited and waited for GM to realize their mistake of killing RWD and for the buyer incentives to come into play to get the price down.  Aside from the typical oil and battery display complaints and my aversion to everything overcomplicated in the controls of ALL new cars, this car is a more than fitting replacement to my 1991 Caprice LTZ.  Took it on a 1,000 mile road trip first weekend and we love it.  Mileage is as advertised, performs and handles like a dream.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't kill it after 3 years like the GTO, I keep my cars for a long long time and need parts availability (pads, rotors, alternators, starters, etc.) and dealer parts and knowledge for the harder stuff."
pontiac,g8,2008,Rod, 08/26/2008,Car will make you excessive compulsive,5,"3 months and 3500 miles and this car has come alive. You stand on the gas and there is a sound you cannot believe till you experience.  You look at the hood to see if it is collapsing as this monster 6.0 sucks air in, it makes a more awesome and powerful sound than my 70 426 Hemi Cuda did.  If you love cars you will love the G8 GT, all you have to do is test drive it and you will want it.  If you want a ultimate performance you can afford this is the best deal out there,."
pontiac,g8,2008,T. Giles, 09/02/2008,My Congratulations to Pontiac,4,"All i have to say is congratulations Pontiac for creating the car I have dreamed of.  I upgraded from a 2004 Grand Prix, a car that i have thoroughly enjoyed for all of the 104000 miles i put on it and i was completely blown away.  The G8 GT is in my opinion one of the best sport sedans ever produced.  It is gorgeous inside and out.  It doesn't have all that goofy euro sport sedan styling, just big fenders and a beefy body.  100% American muscle.  I would recommend this car to anyone!  Pay the extra for the V8 its worth it. "
pontiac,g8,2008,Andrew, 09/03/2008,Is this really a Pontiac ?,4,"I still can't believe this is a Pontiac - I guess GM finally got it right.  The quality is almost BMW, the performance is better than the 5 series, and the cost is amazing for a new V8.  I got a ""deal"" via the GM employee pricing, but would've been nice if the dealer negotiated - they wouldn't budge a dollar, insisting that GM won't let them.  Regardless, I'm so far very happy w/ my purchase - I just can't get use to people's reactions when they it's a Pontiac! lol"
pontiac,g8,2008,Rod, 10/02/2008,4 months and 5000 miles & still in Love,4,"Has been just over 4 months since I bought my G8 GT.  It has only gotten better with time.  With gas prices down a little from when I bought it have switched to premium.  The premium is not required but it do bring the G8 GT to life. Merging onto a freeway can be a little unnerving, if you step down on the throttle to aggressively, you go from 6th to 3rd gear and go from 45 to 70 in a heart beat.  For a door factory (4 door car) the handling is awesome.  This car does not fear windy roads.  In manual mode in 3rd gear 20 mph corners become 50 mph corners.  If you want to love a car like you did when the built muscle cars the G8 GT will fill the bill, and accommodate the family."
pontiac,g8,2008,Richie, 10/10/2008,Like Two Bats Out of Hell!,4,"I have followed this car since I heard about it being available in the US. Overall this car is the best bang for your buck if you want a sport sedan. I looked at a few imports and some other domestics but the G8 won hands down dollar wise. The engine is excellent. I live in NYC and the gas mileage is low in the city (10-12 mpg) and when the highways are packed I see the same results. But when the highways are clear I see 20+mpg easy.  For daily driving the suspension is fine, seats are comfy, exhaust is quiet but open up the engine and it sounds sweet. I had this car for about 2 months and I still smile when I turn her on. "
pontiac,g8,2008,Rod, 10/14/2008,It only gets better,4,"Am going on 5 months with my G8 GT experience.  There are minor flaws I have found if you can call them flaws.  The most exciting one is that when you step on the gas in anyway less than very gentle it responds like a startled cat, it flat jumps and screams for red line.  I have also noticed that once I shift into sports mode or manual mode and stand on the throttle, the car changes from a docile car to a beast, and seems to stay that way till I shut it off and drive it again.  It may be a glitch in my G8's computer.  I will not go get this if it is a glitch.. I love it.  This car loves to be driven.  If you love driving you will love this car.  It rocks!"
pontiac,g8,2008,G8 Is Great, 10/21/2008,GM Is Back On Track,5,"I've had my G8 almost two months now and like it more each day.  The car is amazing to drive from the plentiful power to the superb handling, it makes you want to take the long way every where you go.  The G8 is very comfortable and roomy in size and will easily accommodate taller individuals. Fuel economy is excellent considering this is a 4000 lb vehicle with a 361 hp V8 capable of comfortably hauling 5 full size passengers.  Plus the G8 is half the cost of a 5 series and the V8 form is cheaper than a similarly equipped Mazda 6  The G8 proves GM has turned things around and is back on track!!!"
pontiac,g8,2008,Rod, 10/24/2008,The G8 GT has a flaw,4,"I still love my G8 GT but I did find a flaw.  Minor $62 flaw.  I am a auto mechanic and do things like my own oil change.  When it comes to the G8 that oil change consist of 9 quarts of Mobil 1, and a AC Delco oil filter.  Thank God for Costco who has the best price on Mobil 1, and Auto Zone for their price on Oil and filter.  I have figured that $62 every 5K is very acceptable for what this super sedan gives back in return in performance and just fun to drive.  Now that gas is below $3 a gallon it is even better cause can afford the premium stuff and you can feel the difference in performance of the 6.0."
pontiac,g8,2008,Rod, 11/07/2008,It just keeps getting better,5,Well it is month 6 for me as a G8 owner. 6100 miles of enjotment in driving again. No matter how bad my day at work has been there is this little back road on the way home that I can detour on to and just let the G8 hang out in the corners and all the stress of the day is gone. My 96 Monte Carlo never gave that to me. It just wouldn't handle the 30 mph corners at 60 like the G8. The G8 has to be the best handling american car under $30K not just the most powerful. Oh by the way yesterday I showed a Taurus SHO owner you don't go heads up from a stop light with a G8. If God drives he/she would drive a G8.
pontiac,g8,2008,JTB, 11/22/2008,I love this car!,4,"I have about 9500 miles on my 2008 G8 GT. I drove BMW's, Mercedes, Infinity's, etc. and this was the car I just simply fell in love with. Talk about fun to drive. Even after 9500 miles I still look for excuses to drive it, sometimes making 3-4 trips to the grocery store (my wife thinks I'm reformed)!  I have installed several bolt on high performance upgrades (cold air kit, tune for premium gas, shorty headers with high flow cats keeping the rest of the exhaust system completely stock). The car hauls now.  If I get the jump on a corvette it's by-by baby! The seats are more comfortable than BMW or Mercedes, no kidding. it's very quiet, but most of all, it's fun, fun, fun! Reliable too."
pontiac,g8,2008,Rod, 12/07/2008,7000 mile and still loving it,4,"It has been about 7 months and 7000 miles since I got my G8 GT. I learned one thing this weekend, the G8 is not all about going fast. Going home from work yesterday on freeway was doing 50 came around a blind corner and traffic was stopped.  With the braking performance of my 96 Monte Carlo (I traded in on the G8) in my mind I was hoping that would be just a light crash. Three things happened. I hit the brakes, I saw someting fly on the pasengers side and I was stopped 5 car lengths behind the car ahead of me. The flying things were cargo straps that were on the floor in the back seat area. They bounced off front and ended up in middle of front passenger floor"
pontiac,g8,2008,GregD, 12/20/2008,Great Car - Never Stops Giving!,4,"I have owned this car for almost 8 months and I love it! I traded a 2005 Bonneville GXP, and I did not expect such a great deal from the G8 but, it keeps on giving. The styling, comfort, handeling and cool navigation system are always a good reason to look forward to driving this car. Oh yeah, the Sport Drive is great when you are looking for a thrill! Hopefully GM will keep Pontiac, if not only for the G8, this is the best car and it would be a shame to see it go. Finally, the consumer can own a really terrific car at a great price. "
pontiac,g8,2008,Rod, 01/11/2009,8 months and still loving it,4,"8 Months and 8000 miles and still love this G8 GT. Last month we had the worst snow storm in Oregon in years. The remote start and the heated seats made it a lot better to get out in it.  With $1100 invested in studless snow tires I got every where I needed to go, the limited slip and traction control made driving in the snow no big problem. If GM does close down Pontiac, I hope that they also start importing the Holden Commador SS, or put the G8 in the Buick line-up. This is to good a car to just let die."
pontiac,g8,2008,gmgold, 01/20/2009,Maximum Bang for the Buck,5,This car is one of the very best cars I have ever owned.  Especially considering the price. Even my wife who was very skeptical initially now agrees that it is quite a car. I have had no problems. Fuel mileage is much better than I would have thought. It is just a great car.
pontiac,g8,2008,EAS, 01/28/2009,Don't,2,"The interior is sloppy, and there are very limited choices for seats.  I should have known, but I thought this car was going to bankrupt me when gasoline went to $4 last summer. The best thing about it is how much power you get for the money.       "
pontiac,g8,2008,Patrick, 02/18/2009,Sweet Car,4,"An amazing car for the price. I ended up paying 20600 after taxes, and got a big, beautiful, 256 horsepower 4 door.  The only things I dislike is that the remote start does not turn on the heater, so you have to deal with the frost if you have it.  Also, I had to get a repair (snowy roads- my own fault) and I had to import a part from Australia."
pontiac,g8,2008,Bobbyg8great!, 02/19/2009,GM Nailed This One!,5,"What a great car inside and out. It is pure fun. It is powerful and comfortable. I can haul around the kids with plenty of room to spare. Everywhere I go, people ask me what kind of car it is. I can 70 mph in a heart beat and cruise comfortably and quietly at 80 mph. The fuel economy hovers around 20 miles to the gallon. I get this even when I'm hard on the pedal. I would like the V8 to sound a bit more like a V8, but the wife doesn't know what it is all about this way. Overall this car has been the most pleasing to drive out of all my vehicles. I have owned Caddys, Mercedes, Jeeps, and a Porsche. I think GM nailed this one, it might be a bit too late though. "
pontiac,g8,2008,BHuge, 02/23/2009,A treat to drive,5,"I have always been the type of person who dreaded driving. It was just never any fun. Since we got this car I drive everywhere. I am 6'3"" and there is plenty of room for me up front and plenty of room for my children in the back."
pontiac,g8,2008,Rod, 02/26/2009,9500 miles and getting better,4,"I have had my GT for 9 months and it is getting better.  Fuel mileage is up, it gets within 2 mpg of the 96 Monte Carlo LS I traded in, and the GT has 200hp more.  If I keep my foot out of it average 17 mpg in town.  The problem is keeping my foot out of the throttle.  When you step down on it it is exhilarating."
pontiac,g8,2008,Billy G. Tinker, 03/29/2009,Problems!Problems!Problems!,3,"Stranded on road one month after purchasing due to dead battery.  In shop x4 due to vibrations, pulling to the right, surging when stopping, then the smell of raw gas.  Three sets of nes tires have been put on the car in nine months.  On the fourth time in the shop, we were told by phone the car was fixed, but was still vibrating and GM was having problems with the engine.  I have been very frustrated and displeased with the Pontiac G8 GT.          "
pontiac,g8,2008,Matt, 04/06/2009,Awesome!!,5,"It's a responsible family man's sports car. Powerful, great handling, room for 5 comfortably. "
pontiac,g8,2008,CEllis, 04/20/2009,Hammer Down,4,"I recently bought my G8GT with sunroof, sports and comfort package for my wife as we our first child neccessitated 4 doors. My wife LOVES this car as do I. The power this thing has is incredibly smooth and I regularly find myself going faster than I should. The only weak areas of this car are the brakes, lack of navigation, no memory for the driver (my 98 vette has it, why can't a 09?), the manual knob for the seat back, and the lack of bluetooth in lieu of Onstar (boo). Other than those little things, which are forgotten once I put the gas pedal to the floor, this car is a rockstar. In fact, I will be looking for a nice used GXP once I pay this GT off.   "
pontiac,g8,2008,Rod, 05/07/2009,1 Year and still love it,5,"I have had my G8 GT, it will be 1 year on the May 23rd.  The mileage has gone from 15 to 18 mpg in daily commute and and I do not spare the horses.  I am just glad that with Pontiac going away I am luck enough to have the last and probably the most awesome car Pontiac ever built. I have heard rumors that GM may bring a Police version of the G8 to the US as a Chevy.  The Holden Commador is the #1 police car in Australia."
pontiac,g8,2008,Randy, 05/30/2009,Grrrrrrrreat! G8 GT,5,"Without a doubt this is the best car I've ever had and Pontiac has ever produced. The horsepower and torque are perfect. I like to drive spirited and the car handles perfectly. The factory tires don't hold in wet road conditions but that will be rectified with new ones. I get 18mpg city and 24.5 hyw. I've had no rattles, or any maintenance issues other than the usual oil changes and such. I had the factory stripes put on mine and let me tell you the flat black on red will turn many heads. The gas mileage definately went down when I put them on (just kiding). I am not sorry for buying this car, to my regret it will outlast Pontiac. To sum it up, it's fun to drive you'll love it, buy one."
pontiac,g8,2008,thankful, 06/11/2009,Saved my life,4,"Only had 5400 miles mine when a tractor trailor hit me and drove me off the road and the car rolled over.  The car is a total loss, but I walked away without a scratch. not only was this a great car to drive, it saved my life.  I plan to go out and get 2009 G8 as soon as the insurance claim is settled."
pontiac,g8,2008,vic, 06/23/2009,proud of this pontiac,4,"best car for the price, excellent driving machine. fun to drive , i had i had 5 pontiacs since 60's and i would say this is the best."
pontiac,g8,2008,fuhteng, 07/01/2009,Brilliant car that came too late,5,"I did my research about the sport sedan segment, and while originally looking at the BMW 335i and the G35/37, the G8 GT captivated me. It is bigger, much cheaper, and nearly as much fun. It was just what I was looking for.  Owning it has been a delight. I have never had any problems with the car, and the car does everything I expect from a sports sedan, and does them all well. It is not a luxury car like the BMW and the G, but it is not supposed to be.  The G8 GT is what Pontiac should have been all along."
pontiac,g8,2008,Rod, 08/10/2009,15 months and still Love it,4,"I have had my G8 GT for 18 months and it just gets better.  In the late 60's O had a Plymouth Road Runner.  The working mans inexpensive Muscle Car.  No the in thng is a Performance Sports Sedan.  The G8 GT is the Road Runner of Sports Sedan.  It is a car that the Poor working Slob can afford and have a Performance Sedan that may not be as plush as a BMW 5 series, but in performance, it can hang with it. "
pontiac,g8,2008,bowtiefan1, 08/14/2009,One Awesome Car!,5,"I've owned my new G8 GT since December '08.  It's mostly my weekend and pleasure ride and I can tell you, it's more fun (and practical with kids now) than my last sport's car, an '89 Corvette! It's too bad that Pontiac and the G8 will soon be history.  GM finally got it right with this car and sadly, they are getting rid of it.  My only hope is Fritz will listen to Lutz and will rebadge it as a Chevy or Buick and promote it, like Ford is doing with it's Taurus SHO. No one, except enthusiasts, really knew about this car.  Buy this car soon before it is gone! It's spirited performance and awesome handling will have you hooked!  Lastly, everywhere I go, I get lots of positive looks and feedback."
pontiac,g8,2008,Ohioguy, 08/19/2009,Last New Pontiac,5,"My 2008 G8 GT apparently will be my last new Pontiac.  It is Pontiac number 17 for me, starting with a 1965 GTO.  They certainly saved the best for last.  I love this car!  From it's sinister metallic black paint to it's red & black leather seats, it is a winner.  Losing Pontiac is painful.  Not continuing this car is a sin.  GM -  please wake up!  "
pontiac,g8,2008,Rod, 08/30/2009,More fun for the buck,5,"In my last post I mentioned that a Magnaflow exhaust system would be delivered the next day.  Well, it was and it made my G8 even more fun.  The exhaust made the car sound great, with out making everyday driving to noisy like other systems I have had.  Another upside is that gas mileage has gone up from a average of 16.4 to 17.1 in every day commute."
pontiac,g8,2008,Chase413, 04/30/2010,Great,4,"The car is great, could not have asked for a better vehicle from GM. Had an 07 SS impala before and they improved just about everything i didn't like about the impala. the handling, suspension, rear wheel drive, it's just a smooth ride with everything you would need in a car and the ability to get up and go with cars that cost a good deal more. (ex: Taurus sho for 40 something, g8 gt for less than 30) "
pontiac,g8,2008,Keaton, 03/25/2008,The best Pontiac has out there,5,"Basically a $30,000 BMW 5 series.  This is the nicest car Pontiac has ever put out.  People keep asking me if it is the new designed.  It is nothing like it.  Pontiac built it differently from the ground up.  Almost a perfect 50/50 weight distribution makes this car handle better than most.  And the styling is very up to date, but does not resemble any other car out there.  I would suggest at least a test drive from anybody.  If you look at this car like any other old Pontiac you will definitely sell yourself short!"
pontiac,g8,2008,danevick, 03/26/2008,Put another Shrimp on the Bar-b!!,4,"When you have a bad back like me, a vehicle must have a comfortable seat.  What Pontiac doesn't tell you is that BOTH front seats actually have 10 way adjustments with the premium pkg. I've owned Lexus, BMW and Mercedes, and this car is the equal of any of them. The level of refinement is unbelievable for the price, and, I can actually sit behind myself with room to spare, which I can't even do in a Suburban, since I set the seat far from the steering wheel. Back seat comfort is also great.Throw in 361hp, great ergonomics, Bavarian looks, uplevel materials inside, and better than Mercedes build quality outside, and Pontiac's got a WINNER! Go for it before they're gone because of CAFE regs"
pontiac,g8,2008,Dexter, 03/26/2008,First to review the G8,4,"Great car!  My ignition orange drives well, is comfortable, and is turning heads!"
pontiac,g8,2008,Jason DeSmit, 03/27/2008,Amazing! Simply amazing!,4,"I finally decided to trade in my 2002 Grand Prix GTP for the new G8 GT (one of the first 888) and I'm anything but disappointed! I can't truly express in words as to how much fun this car is to drive! I fall in love with it every time that I get inside! Whenever I'm not driving it, all that I want to do is drive somewhere...anywhere! Road trip anyone?"
pontiac,g8,2008,DC Lasting, 03/30/2008,The U.S.(and Australia) is back.,4,"I drove a Lexus ISF, Acura TLS, Lexus IS350, CadillacCTS,  Dodge Charger, and a Camry Hybrid (for my eco moment).  The price/performance combination win goes to the G8 GT.  GM could spend very little more and have the fit and finish of cars far more expensive with matching performance.  While the ISF was a pure rocket, at $62K there was not a $30k difference for me (assuming I could afford it). The G8 looks as good as it drives. I am 6+ and this vehicle fit me better than any of the above on the drivers side.  The passenger side is about the same as the others..a little short on leg room.  There is a minor fit issue with the hood where there is too much gap at the center.  9+ for me."
pontiac,g8,2008,KaiserM715, 03/31/2008,Incredible package!!,4,"My wife and I have put about 1000 miles on our G8.  It is FANTASTIC!!  The acceleration is brisk, the handling is crisp and the interior is excellent. The look of the car is somewhat European (or Aussie!!).  The fit and finish and ergonomics are all excellent.  The leather with the premium package has an excellent feel.  The seats are very comfy on road trips and the back seat leg room is generous. The steering wheel with the sport package feels very nice in your hands.  The car is a great value, a lot of features and a lot of car for the money."
pontiac,g8,2008,Erik, 03/29/2008,Great looking and fast American car,4,"Picked up the G8 this week...  The best looking sports sedan I've seen in awhile.  The body design alone will make the Euro lovers rethink things.  The V8 packs some serious punch.  I thought the interior would be chintzy, but it's not bad.  Great leather seats and the leather steering wheel is nice.  The dash could be better... but compared to past GM cars it's a big step up and not that far behind euro competition.  This car is one helluva value and turns heads everywhere I go."
pontiac,g8,2008,suprfan, 03/29/2008,New G8GT,4,The hype is not hype at all. This car finally brings Pontiac into the next millennium. The car is truly a performer that is an everyday driver even with kids. A+ 
pontiac,g8,2008,Twenty2inDubz, 03/30/2008,Bad!,4,"I never thought that I would buy a Pontiac!! Considering only driving foreign automobiles. Paid $33K for the car and it feels like it's worth more. Driving this beast is incredible .. fast, responsive BMW killer!! Thank you GM .... keep them  coming.  Number 037 of 888"
pontiac,g8,2008,Mo, 03/30/2008,The G8 is a 4 door GTO,4,"I previously had a 2006 GTO and despite all the press, I really like the car. It was fast, reliable, and turned heads with the rumble of its exhaust. My children are getting a little older and the back seats of the GTO a touch small. I read up on the G8 and found it to be a 4 door version of the GTO with all the muscle, performance, and fun I want. Yesterday, I test drove on of the First 888, number 511 and drive home in it. It lives up to the reviews and is as fast and wild as any sedan... way better than the CTS. If you looking for a toy, carry the family, and bring the lawn mower to the shop, this ride is perfect. "
pontiac,g8,2008,Sparky881, 04/01/2008,Amazing Car for the Price,4,"I was called by the Dealer at 9 am, when a G8 came in to test drive it. Arrived at the dealership at 10am. Loved the way it looked,and fun to drive.Three minutes into the test drive I told the dealer I'd take it, took it home that afternoon. Stopped at Starbucks on the way home, at the store had 5 people ask me about the car, they all said it was a amazing looking car. When I got home, some of the neighbors started asking about it. Already put on 150 miles was real fun to drive on interstate 75 in Florida. Like this car more than any car I've owned since 1969 (GTO)"
pontiac,g8,2008,Benny, 04/01/2008,Power/Fun/perfect blend high/low tech,4,"This car has great power from the 6.0L. Comfortable ride that was not expected but the car combines the low tech, high out put of a large V8, rear drive and fat tires with a high tech suspension, traction & stability control, shiftable 6 speed auto tranny for a civilized ride. I drive hard and this car feels right during hard driving. "
pontiac,g8,2008,twort, 04/02/2008,#41 of 888,4,I have had my g8 for a week now.  I like it a lot.  I am averaging 16 mpg but is all city driving.  I have put 200 miles on it with out a problem.  Car is much more comfortable then my camaro z28 and feels quicker too but have not given it a work out yet.  Have to wait till I get some more miles.  The one thing I wish it had is displaying a the title of a song when listening to the radio.  My wifes 03 Grand am does this and it is a nice feature.  I can't tell when the active fuel management kicks in.  It would be nice to have some kind of indication on the dash if you are in 4 or 8 mode. Handling is great with little body roll in sharp corners and tons of room. This is a great value car
pontiac,g8,2008,765 of 888, 04/02/2008,765 of 888,4,"Well Pontiac outdid themselves with this car. Not only is it a beautiful looking car with a great comfortable interior. I  have two kids and possibly a third. I know I can fit all three seats in the back seat with no probs. The best thing of all is the power this car has is unbelievable and I've yet to push it because of the newness of the car. (no kids during testing) It's sleek,comfortable, and rides like a dream. I can't give this car a perfect 10 because I don't know how reliable it'll be. As far as gas I give it a 10 because I knew what I was getting into buying a V8 and I think  it's getting pretty good mileage for a beast of a car. I highly recommend this car. U won't be disappointed."
pontiac,g8,2008,RisorBob, 04/05/2008,Thanks LOADED for $30K - V8 sedan :o),4,"I previously owned a 2005 CTS-V and traded on a G8 GT after test driving it four three hours... Thanks to my dealer for that. The car is underpowered compared and doesn't brake as well as the caddy. However the fit and finish are great, the auto with tiptronic is awesome. I never thought that I'd be that guy that got tired of the stick but it happened. A loaded V8 sedan for $30K is awesome and I agree by a Garman Nuvi for $200 if you want NAV it will crush any in car system. It's a Holden with better versions still to come but this is a great car a family sedan with the sports when you want it and everyone who sees it says WOW it looks like a BMW - I love it. For the money you can't beat it."
pontiac,g8,2008,Anthony, 04/06/2008,Hi I'm from Australia,4,I purchased a ve holden commodore S which is the same vehicle as the Pontiac g8 (different nose & vents on Pontiac). It is a six speed manual shift & does 0-100 km/hr (66 mph) in 5.6 secs and standing quarter mile in 13.4 secs- so it performs brilliantly. It is also well built and handles like a sports car. It is also very well equipped-turns head - black with silver stripes. Very pleased with it!
pontiac,g8,2008,Don P, 04/08/2008,Wow,4,"Been watching and reading about this car for months. Finally got to see it and test drive it on a rainy night. Amazing performance, handling, ride and comfort. Has just the right features and accessories to make it the perfect car. What a treat to drive. Absolutely the most exciting vehicle I've ever owned. A good value, even at MSRP."
pontiac,g8,2008,adrian blindt, 04/08/2008,Love this car!,5,"Wasn't looking for a new car but couldn't resist this when it came out.  I can't wait to go out driving every day and look forward to an excuse to go for a longer run.  The performance from the 6L V8 is simply amazing for a stock $30,000 car and it handles like a dream.  Very comfortable seats (I'm a physical therapist and seats are important to me), great driving position.  Spacious rear seat.  Excellent stereo.  Great trunk space.  Did I mention the engine and the performance?!  Even managing decent fuel economy (20+mpg) on longer runs thanks to cylinder deactivation."
pontiac,g8,2008,BruceUSA, 04/12/2008,Fun Fast and ALL it's cracked up to be!,4,"So far so good.  All of the advertising leading up to the introduction of this car has been right on point. The balance of handling and the pure power of the V8 combine to make this the best performance bargain out there. GM has always had a little numb steering, even in the two Vettes I've owned. This car has the spot on steering feel that performance cars should have and driving becomes a pure pleasure once again! The fit and finish are world class and the few quirks (as with any car even my 2004 Porsche 911 Targa) are not all that big of a deal. Home run Pontiac! Go test drive one and you'll want to buy it."
pontiac,g8,2008,hjames, 04/16/2008,Awesome,4,"I have number 663 and just picked it up on Monday. The car is one of a kind it reminds me a little of my e30 m3. Very redefined in every letter, and speaks to the driver during acceleration. This car will make a statement and I'm glad I have one. I can drive my g8 with the likes of BMW and Lexus. I can also run the boys on the weekend if I like. The answer for any mid life crisis."
pontiac,g8,2008,Cornerstone8605, 04/16/2008,Awesome,5,"Hey folks! Talk about an AWESOME car with power! For me being a female I did my homework on this vehicle.  I waited until the G8 finally came out.  I owned a '97 Grand Prix and held unto for 11 years (which I just sold today, 15 Apr 08) because I DID NOT like the body style of the Grand Prix from 2004 to 2007. Hubby got me the Liquid Red G8, V6 engine, with the comfort package & premium package, no sunroof. For it to be a V6, this car has some power almost like the GT V8, but in my opinion much better gas mileage. So ladies, don't be intimidated in purchasing this for yourself. This is one HECK of a machine. You will have no regrets with this car!    "
pontiac,g8,2008,Gene, 04/19/2008,Awesome Car,4,I think this is my 4th Pontiac. Just turned in my '04 Grand Prix GT2 for the G8. Prior to that I had 2 Grand Prix GTPs. Only had it 3 1/2 days. This car looks more like a BMW and handles like it! Quite a bit heavier and more responsive that the Grand Prix. Like the GT but decided that I didn't really need the V8 and the V6 really has plenty of power.  The only difference in the two are the quad tail pipes and the clear  tail light covers on the GT. The V6 has dual tail pipes and red light covers.  I agree the amp meter and oil pressure displays need to go. Would like to be able to select items from the DIC and and transfer it to this display. Could probably be done with a computer upgrade.
pontiac,g8,2008,Greg T, 04/25/2008,Go Buy a G8 NOW,4,"This car handles and rides incredibly.  I love everything about it except the following:  tilt wheel has a lever which means to move the wheel out of your way, you must move the lever and then relock every time; FM reception is fair; gas filler door is a push from the outside design.  It should be a inside release or have a finger opening.  The interior materials are way softer than my buddy's 530i; his door handles dig into your knees and hurt.  Trunk and seats are huge. Great effort, great car.  Buy one now!"
pontiac,g8,2008,gtocpa, 04/28/2008,GO Buy a G8 NOW!,4,"This is a GREAT car.  Believe everything you've read and more.  If you drive this car, you will buy it.  It is absolutely incredible and I'd compare it to any YUPPIE mobile. I have to fight my wife on who gets to drive it!!  Go buy this thing now and show GM that when you finally build it right, we will come back!  My kids get up every morning and say hello to the G8 - it's that awesome."
pontiac,g8,2008,Key Stone Cop, 04/29/2008,377 of 888,4,I have owned many cars including three BMW's and this car is more comfortable and drives as well or better than the 525 BMW.

pontiac,g8,2008,John Bruning, 05/10/2008,Buy This Car Now!!!!,4,"Just purchased a G8 GT, liquid red. This is a big car with the handling of a tiny European sports car. Turn radius is amazingly tight. Power is incredible-almost as good as my 400 HP GTO. The On-Star system is a tremendous value, as is the hand's free phone. Interior is spacious and comfy. This is a car to take on a back road in the hills. It loves curves and turns. It is a joy to drive. Pontiac & Holden have hit a home run with this beast. I'm sold on Pontiac, and GM will have my business for years to come."
pontiac,g8,2008,wesson smith, 05/09/2008,424 of 888,4,"""Mean"" look vehicle. I have never owned a vehicle which causes so many heads to turn as when I drive by. I even had a Pontiac dealer who had not yet received a G8 chase me down to look at my car. I have the Sedan, which is quicker than a lot of V8s. Some cheap features such as flimsy door handles and no XM is disappointing. Cheap stereo controls on the steering wheel. Flip open key looks cool, but seems flimsy and surely will not last. Hugh trunk and great back seat leg room. "
pontiac,g8,2008,142 of 888, 05/10/2008,142 of 888,4,I decided a while ago never to buy an American car again. However I came home with a 4-door Corvette! Couldn't wait for the gxp and I must say this car is great! I wanted a Corvette or that new Camaro but it's taking forever. It has a ton of interior room more than a charger srt8 which I drove. Gas mileage is okay but if I wanted better I should get a Toyota Prius! 
pontiac,g8,2008,Steve Brintle, 05/13/2008,Best Pointac yet,4,"This is a car with plenty of room, that is very comfortable to drive, handles like a sports car, and has the performance of the early muscle car. Truly a fine car. The only problem I had was getting one."
pontiac,g8,2008,Jim in MS, 05/13/2008,Cool Car,4,"The car is very fast (6.0 is great), handles great, and is very hard to find.  Dealer looked for weeks before we found a GT that would do.  It still was not the color we wanted (we got red wanted gray, but car does turn heads) nor did it have the performance package, but it does have the sunroof and leather.  Great seats, great steering, really really fast.  Dealer only discounted $500 off the sticker, but still good value for so much car."

pontiac,g8,2008,kmag53, 05/29/2008,Fantastic car,4,All I can say is GM hit a home run with this car. It has virtual everything you would want in a performance sedan except the high price. In todays market it is a true bargain. Very comfortable interior and everything is placed where it should be...exterior is very sharp and it gets many gawkers. I cannot say the handling of the car is sports car like but it is very good for a four door sedan. Brakes are very good and stop with confidence. Of course the raw power of the V8 is awesome with tons of torque. Trunk is very spacious and the back seat is extremely comfortable even for someone like myself who is tall. 
pontiac,g8,2008,Meat, 11/24/2016,Affordable RWD Sedan with some decent performance,4,"helped a friend pick this car out after his driving style indicated he needed something that could take more of a beating.  Model was a burnt orange 3.6 with a fair amount of features for the year and I have to say I was pretty impressed. RWD is definitely the way to go if you're a driving enthusiast you just have to be careful when things get slippery. The car rides very well and is extremely planted on the road. You can feel EVERYTHING you drive over due to the suspension setup and wide sporty tires they use on this but this was made with that in mind so be warned.  Road noise is slightly excessive but bearable as you can hear the engine (which does sound pretty decent) and on the highway wind noise is also tolerable.  Fit and finish of the car are really well and alot of surfaces are soft touch which I do commend the automaker for but they do make the vehicle extremely heavy so the engine does have to work pretty hard from a stop to get moving quickly but again thats something you can easily fix with the GT model of this car. Steering is slightly numb but better than the typical GM fashion that normally goes into vehicles. For a ""sporty"" sedan though it does lack slightly. Overall the car is a great value and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a sportier ride yet needing to keep in mind space in the back and some sensibility.

I'm more than satisfied with my 16/19 MPG average in the city and 20/24 in the highway while cruising at around 80-90 MPH it feels very stable and well planted. It's awesome around corners with it's 50/50 weight distribution. The interior is quiet and comfortable but definitely sports car like.

The V8 is powerful and responsive, tires get great grip, good handling the weight ratio is almost 50/50 which helps the suspension and handling but if you have the option the fe3 suspension on the GXP is better. The fact that you can buy one for under 20K and the car is competitive to hang with last model Camaro's and Mustang's that are twice the price tag is the best reason to buy this car. "

Bmw performance at USA prices.
The build quality is very good.
I get around 19mph overall gas mileage.
It uses regular gas.
Get one of the plug tuners for tuning the transmission. Stock it shifts to late and makes the car seem sluggish, unless in sport mode.
Tuning corrects this issue and transforms the car!
Tires are pricey."

I drive it 2 or 3 times a week just to keep everything well lubricated. I have tried to stay on top of required maintenance & try to use only high quality replacement fluids & filters. So far no problems to report. At 77+ yrs old the car is driven carefully, it is comfortable & a pleasure to drive. I plan to keep it until I pass on , have not seen any thing I would want to replace it with. Always garaged & not driven in the rain way to anal I know. but I have a little suv for my daily driver. now have 41850 on the odometer still loving the car.

I originally wanted one when they were new but they were a little too expensive so I went with a used Grand Prix GXP (big mistake). So far I love this car. I get ""nice car"" comments weekly, even by my local GM/ex-Pontiac dealer who apparently doesn't get to service too many of these. If you are looking for performance and value you really can't beat this. For a new car with this performance you'd easily spend $35k."
pontiac,g8,2009,Poncho Man, 02/23/2017,Why did Pontiac leave us!!!!,5,"I bought this car used in 2015,  It is indeed the most fun car I ever drove outside of my 81 Turbo Trans Am. The performance and handling is awesome. I could've got a V8 G8, but the V6 is enough for me. To this day it's quite the head turner and I love the fact folks have trouble believing it's a Pontiac. I get 32 mph to the gallon on the highway, 18 in the city. Compared to other owners I'm doing just great on gas mileage. I have all the options with the exception of the leather interior and V8 engine. I talked my son into buying a GXP version to keep him out of mine....LOL.  Plenty of power, but I'm very happy with the V6. No major issues. I've only had to replace a couple of sensors and that's to be expected over period of time with any car. If Pontiac hadn't gotten the axe. I know this car would have evolved into a force to be reckoned with. My G8 will never be sold or traded in. It will be with me until the wheels fall off.
"
pontiac,g8,2009,Dan Murphy Jr., 05/03/2017,Best Car I've Ever Owned,5,"I bought my 2009 G8 V6 exactly 2 years ago with 30,000 miles on it, and traded in a 2006 Acura TL 6-spd. I was initially concerned about the automatic transmission of the G8 taking the fun out of driving, but I was very wrong. Even with an auto trans, the G8 accelerates very well, handles like a dream (minimal oversteer), and shifts smoothly in normal and sport driving modes. I detail cars, so I keep mine pristine all the time; and I've received more compliments for this car than my previous 4 cars combined. Pontiac did a great job with the exterior styling modification of the Holden Commodore platform. I've put 25,000 miles on the G8 in 2 years and haven't run into any major issues, just basic maintenance and cleaning. Although I love the way it drives and the exterior styling, the interior is less than impressive. Cheap plastic, a crappy Blaupunkt audio system, and low-budget red graphics leave a lot to be desired. Aside from the interior, it's been a fantastic vehicle, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a full-size sporty sedan on a budget.

The car is very fast, as expected with GM's legendary 6.0l V8, packing 361 hp & 385 ft lbs of torque, maited to a 6 speed automatic. 

The comfort inside is great. Fully adjustable heated leather seats, dual zone climate control, plenty of legroom in all 4 seats, lots and lots of buttons everywhere, how can you go wrong? 

With a good set of snow tires, this car has zero trouble getting through winter. You can drive this car year round with no trouble. I am very pleased with it and it puts a smile on my face every time I get behind the wheel."

This a great sports car.
I bought it after buying and then having to sell an Audi S4 (I can't use a manual due to a bad knee).
The G8 is very fast and has a great automatic transmission.
The seats are great and the interior is large enough for adult people who are larger than a size medium, unlike most sporty cars. 
Factory autostart has a range of about 25 feet line of sight. This car would be perfect if it had 2 inches more ground clearance, AWD, and better visiblity."

Performance wise it's still one of the best. it's a nice suttle ride with a quiet comfortable cabin. People just look and stare they don't even know what kind of car it is and that's the best part about it. I preferred this over the Chargers, challengers, mustangs and camaros.
The cars you see every 5 mins on the road. I get compliments everyday, and paired with a Borla exhaust this is the cream of the crop for uncommon American muscle. Wanna be different? Go with the G8 it won't disappoint

Then on day while having my Chrysler Sebring Conv. serviced I happened to see the front end on a G8 in the preowned car area. I walked over and took a look and walked in and said how much. That very day I solved my sedan problem and have really enjoyed the driving experience of the Dark Gray V- 6. I have put 3000 more miles on it and have been avg 27.5 on Hwy and 21 hwy/city. I took it to the mountains to see how it handled the curves and climb and was very much pleased with it. I plan to keep this car until the wheels fall off.

pontiac,g8,2009,Jerome, 12/08/2009,GREAT CAR (EVEN IN V6 FORM),4,For the last 6 months I would see a slate gray G8 GT parked in the same spot on my way from work everyday. Each time my head would turn 90 degrees to look at it every time I passed by it. I went to a dealer who said that they did not have anymore G8's left. I went expecting to buy a 2010 Buick LaCrosse. When I got there they had (1) G8 Sedan left displayed on the showroom in Liquid Red. My wife and I took it for a test drive and immediately fell in love with the performance & handling of this car. I've had it for a month now and have been driving with it in sportshift mode and learning how to drive using the the Tapshift. Fun factor increases 10 fold in these modes even in V6 form.

Yes the BMW has a nicer interior but it's also twice the price. I've had the car 3 years and love to drive it. If you can get your hands on one, get it while you can.

Love the looks, outside and in; the ride is sporty and fun and fast.
I wish I would have spent the extra grand on the GT but, oh well.
I bought brand new and have put 42K miles on since 4/09.
Around town driving you get about 18 mpg and freeway about 24.
Of course, I have a lead foot and enjoy going fast in my red baby so if you drive the speed limit, you'll get better. Nice thigh/knee support for picky drivers.

Better value than overpriced European imports.  Solid, handles well, and very good acceleration.  Gas mileage not great, but gets about 2 mpg less than a high output V6.

So much fun and the expressions are priceless, although not usually around to see them unless I catch a light further up the road. My overpowering thought when I leave someone in the dust is 'google it. G8GXP'. Sooo much fun, yet very drivable and comfortable on the road. Best MPH on a trip is just under 25, but like others have said, 'who cares'. BTW, I have the 6 speed manual. The drop down wouldn't let me choose."

We needed four doors and we didn't want to break the bank.  I stumbled upon this Pontiac, and what luck!  The only con I see to this G8 is the cup holders in the front.  They sit too far back.  There are no cup holders in rear of the cabin which is inconvenient.  And a lack of a navigation system is disappointing.  However, that all melts away when you smash down the accelerator.  All in all, I'm very pleased with our purchase and hope that we spent $25K on a great product. "

If you like 500 HP at the rear wheels, this is the way to go. Keep in mind Fly wheel HP doesn't tell the whole story! All these inflated HP numbers are at the Fly Wheel.

pontiac,g8,2009,molina67, 01/06/2012,Known Engine Problems,3,"I bought this car new, and was not told of the potential problem with the engine. Before I get into the engine problems, the V6 gets terrible gas mileage for the horse power.
Most 4 cylinder cars are faster than the V6 and the most you'll get is 24 mpg highway.
After 28000 miles the check engine light comes on, I take it to the dealer and it sits in maintenance for a week because of camshaft problems.
I did research and found that the problem is well known.
Needless to say I traded it in.

I put 1100 miles on the odometer and developed a great first impression of this car.  It is tight, corners superbly, handles great and drives like a car much smaller than it's size.  GM  really  got this one right!  Acceleration wasn't outstanding with the V6, but balanced against gas mileage, it offered plenty for everyday, long term driving.  I averaged almost 24 mpg for the 1100 miles in combination of driving including pushing it pretty hard on some back roads and freeways.  Nice car...I'll have this one on my shopping list."

Obviously the HP is great out of the hole, but you really notice it on the highway with its passing power. The styling and handling is equal or better than anything I test drove before buying (CTS, A4, BMW 3). I can't believe their isn't more of these on the road already, it really is a big step up for Pontiac and GM. The one thing you really need to know is if you don't want to buy this car, DO NOT TEST DRIVE IT! Once you take it for a spin, you will not want to let go!"

It seems like the Aussie's are the one's who are keeoing there end of the deal.  People want more than just trucks and SUV's.  Sure the fuel economy isn't the greatest, but let's be resonable here, it's a 6.2 litre!  You have to pay to play.  I put an air intake (RotoFab), aftermarket exhaust (Borla) and some SLP headers and that made a huge difference.  This car is very responsive to performance upgrades, especially intake and exhaust.

I got big 19 inch snow tires for this baby since it is not really driveable in snowy weather. That reduced the mileage factor slightly. I used to have a problem accessing the highway ramp in my old Buick Park Avenues. With this car you have zero problem..regular or snow tires the car's acceleration is nothing less than fantastic.

After that, it developed a vacuum leak in the fuel system, an engine mount came loose, the brake lights stopped working, and the front fascia came loose. Then, it needed a new steering rack, and all new control arms in the front. The car vibrates like a guitar string at all speeds. It squeaks, rattles, and buzzes in various places, and the steering has a lot of slack, despite all the new parts up front. The V8 engine runs OK, but the transmission is very slow to shift and never seems to find the right gear. A lot of wind and road noise, but little engine sound. 32046 current miles."

I've been a GM guy and in the auto biz for almost 30 years.    12 major malfunctions at 1k miles Paleeeeze. GM seems to have lost it as far as I'm concerned. If you have issues with your car like I do, you will find out what ""The New GM"" is really all about. Based on my current experience, I would not recommend any new GM product. My car is a lemon!"
pontiac,g8,2009,Pontiac Fan, 09/19/2008,Love driving again,4,Believe the hype. This is a powerful and fun car to drive with comfort too. Thanks GM for bringing it to the states.
pontiac,g8,2009,Brent, 11/04/2008,No passenger leg room,3,"I have the V6, it is extremely noisy, low gas mileage especially in town. I get maybe 24 on the open highway.   They replaced the tires twice at the dealer and it still shakes at 65/70 MPH.  The worst feature is the front passenger seat does not go back as far as the driver side. It is 5 inches shorter and anyone over 5 foot 10 inches is very uncomfortable.  Pontiac attitude is poor regarding this"
pontiac,g8,2009,JOHN, 03/01/2009,right string and the WRONG YOYO :(,3,"have owned lots of dif' cars.. after living with this latest GM wonder..(only decent car they've tried to build in over 10 years). DRIVETRAIN: pretty good ! 4cyl. shutdown works!(23mpg@80 and under 14sec. darn good  :trans- kinda close. suspension/steering..borderline lousy! steers hard at slow speed and too light at speed. rear end skips on ANY rough surface and the darn thing weighs as much as my previous crown vic..which with aftermarket sway bars, out handles it....  Interior sound system..1 on a hundred! other controls..fire the computer nerd !  "
pontiac,g8,2009,RICK, 03/19/2010,Hot car for old man hunting trouble,4,"I debated buying a BMW 550i. I am glad I found my G8 GT WHT, bad news. Really fun to drive and no problem passing anything on the road. You must add radar due to reaching min speed limit in seconds. I am a 58 yr old guy with a new toy. When you have a stressful day and want to unload steam on the road, fun. I had several 1968 through 71 high performance Plymouth products. This car is no match for the money. Loves curves and quarter mile. GM needs to remake in future as an Caprice. Loves gas but who cares"
pontiac,g8,2009,mannheimer6, 01/29/2010,This car almost killed my wife twice,2,"Twice now, unexplained and unfixable shut downs from 70 to 0 MPH in the middle of I-75 and I-4 respectively. We were told loose connector at B+ bulkhead terminal for fatal flaw excuse number 1. Now it is an overheating fuel pump module for fatal flaw excuse number 2. Letters to CEO GM sent. Car is now 2.5 hours away after Onstar recovered it. No matter what I am told about this car, we shall never trust it again, nor drive it again, and as far as we are concerned it can rot where it is, or I can park it right through the windows of a GM dealership and walk away. We are done with GM. Forever. DO NOT BUY HERE."
pontiac,g8,2009,costeld, 06/02/2012,Love it but lacks common features,4,"Fast, comfortable and smooth ride on poor roads. Very quite cabin. Responsive steering. Good brake performance. Very supportive seats. Distinctive styling. Solid clutch and transmission. Good consistent power. Nice exhaust note. Head turner (thats a Pontiac?)."
pontiac,g8,2009,Race Horse Drive, 08/08/2008,Great Car,4,I have driven the 2009 G8 GT for a week now. It is a great handling car with unbelievable power.The gas mileage seems reasonable considering the horsepower. I have not had a car that I have enjoyed driving this much since I owned a late sixties GTO. Pontiac really got this one right.
pontiac,g8,2009,Ward, 08/08/2008,Own it,5,"I bought this vehicle the end of July 08.  Always thought I wanted a Charger.  After test driving both I found I prefer the G8.  It has more power than I'll ever need and very comfortable seating.  My teens vibrate the whole car with their music, but otherwise the sound system in great.  And I found it affordable."
pontiac,g8,2009,MTA, 08/12/2008,BMW 5 Series Eater,5,"This car is ridiculous.  Everywhere I go, it turns heads.  Pontiac listened to all the customer suggestions on the 2008 and on the 20009, got rid of the oil & temperature gauges in the center console, added XM Radio standard and no noises other than the awesome purr of the engine as I upshift past overpriced German imports.  The V8 blows doors on everything else in its class while getting surprisingly good gas mileage.  If you want to enjoy driving again, go get yourself a 2009 G8 GT.   "
pontiac,g8,2009,sa, 08/16/2008,Each Day I Like It More,4,"I didn't really want this car. It was a gift. Now that I've had it a week, and driven it daily, I've fallen in love with it. I just want to get in and drive.  It's a white G8 GT with all of the options, including 19"" summer tires and two toned seats. I love the V8 but dislike the MPG, then again, what does one expect with a V8?  The previous review said that there wasn't a trunk release button, there is, in glove compartment."
pontiac,g8,2009,Stryker Bluestreak, 08/21/2008,Stryker Blue Streak,4,"I just bought a 2009 G8 GT, Stryker blue.  The color was chosen by my wife, I wanted Panther black but I am getting used to it! The car rides very well in comparison to my 2004 GTO. The ride is firm but not as harsh as the GTO.  I have not really pushed the G8 yet but I expect great performance.  Fit and finish are very good.  My wife has received many compliments on the car's appearance.  It has sleek and muscular lines. Difficult to combine but the G8 has them.  I looked at the new CTS but the G8 offered a V8, Cadillac didn't, plus, at a lower price point ($10K). I looked at several imports, but I have bought American for over 25 years.  Congratulations to GM for importing this fine car."
pontiac,g8,2009,Ronny I, 08/26/2008,The new GM standard of quality and feel.,4,"The Pontiac G8 GT is the most fun blend of comfort, performance and style I have ever found in a car in this price class. It is my 1st brand new car of the lot, that is how highly I think of this car I risked to buy it new. It has tremendously good comfort, outstanding acceleration and low interior noise. I've put 4k miles on it in a month, and I'm extremely pleased with this vehicle, it has the best design and layout of the available space in the chassis. Comfortable dash and seats with superhigh quality feel, that was very lacking in previous years. I've had two Pontiac Grand Prix's before this, they served me well. But this is the NEW standard we see from GM. THANK YOU MR. LUTZ for the G8."
pontiac,g8,2009,candaceo, 08/29/2008,"So much car, so few back roads",4,"I looked at the 08's in May but so glad I waited to get a Pacific Slate '09. This car is the perfect balance between performance and price and brings back all the passion and enthusiasm for driving that the recent choices between fuel economy or expensive luxury have deprived us of. Driving is fun, fast and effortless and I honestly don't care about no nav since getting there in this car is 'all' the fun."
pontiac,g8,2009,jeff, 09/01/2008,What a Pontiac,5,All i can say is this is the best car i ever owned. I can't understand why Pontiac didn't bring this car over sooner. I love the power of the v8 and the mpg are great for the engine size. This car to me handles better than the BMW 5 series. Pontiac needs to do a lot more advertising with this car. Its a 4 door vette. You cant go wrong with this one. It was sold before i even test drove it  
pontiac,g8,2009,SDG8GT, 09/05/2008,"Ideal performance, value and fun blend.",5,"My 2009 Panther Black Metallic G8 GT is my first brand new car.  Picked it up with 12 miles on the odometer.  It has the two-tone seats, premium, sport and sunroof.  The 6.0 L V-8 makes getting freeway merging and passing effortless, even when the car is filled with passengers and cargo.  My G8 GT is a head turner and driving in it, is much like driving a in a fish bowl.  At 6'2, finding a comfortable driving position was easy.  The back seat handles 3 real-sized adults easily.  The trunk will swallow 2-3 golf bags no problem.  On a recent road trip we got up to 22 MPG on 87 octane.  A lot of that trip was surface street driving."
pontiac,g8,2009,Jay, 09/08/2008,GTO + G6 = G8 GT,4,"I have never had so much fun driving a car ever in my life. I drive like an old man in my G8 GT. Reason being if you hit the accelerator, she will fly!! But when you cruise, the G8 is quiet and smooth. The bucket seats will sink you in for a very comfortable ride. I love the armrest leveled with the controls in the middle for a different feel. Also I love the twitch that shakes from 6.0 V8 time to time from the as you sit in idle at a light. I never felt so good driving an automobile in my life. I have my Corvette for the fraction of the price!!  GM has finally answered our prayers for a muscle car!!"
pontiac,g8,2009,Michael, 09/21/2008,Red lights slow us down,4,I bought a Black 09' Pontiac G8 GT and could not be happier. I have been to the gas station a couple times and people come right up to me asking me all about the car. I too love when stopping at red lights and having the car rattle slightly from the V8 anxiously waiting to go. I smile every time I go on a drive and glad this was the first new car I have purchased. 
pontiac,g8,2009,Todd, 09/26/2008,For folks tired of European car prices!,4,"This car is the perfect replacement for people, like me, who are tired of the ever increasing price of Audis, BMWs, Volvos etc.. No price gouging on the options packages either. There are only three options, and they are all very reasonably priced. Just try to get a Sports Package on a European car for under $600! The car is an incredible value. Fast, great handling, great build quality, great looking. Also very quiet and comfortable. I've had M3s, 3 Series, 5 Series, SAABs and my last car was a Volvo S60R. This car shames them all, and at this price it's a knock out in the first round!"
pontiac,g8,2009,Dan, 09/25/2008,Let's go somewhere,4,"Had an'03 BMW 325i that I drove to 100K miles, then an '08 Accord V6 that I hated from day 2...their cylinder deactivation was very noticeable, and now have 2K miles on '09 G8 GT. Have the same feeling for the G8 that I had for the BMW...let's go somewhere!  Don't think I will ever get tired of that sweet engine rumble.  Lived in Australia for a few years as a teen and admired the Holden's back then so great to have one stateside now.  I'm in sales and live in my car. Very impressed with interior ergonomics, sound system, seat comfort, and low interior noise level on the highway.  Way to go gm. Wasn't sure I would ever buy another one.  Now if this car just got the hwy mileage of a vette."
pontiac,g8,2009,DaveK, 09/27/2008,G8 GT - The Car I Didn't Know I Wanted,5,"I thought my next new vehicle would be a compact electric or diesel SUV, until an unplanned test drive of the '09 Pontiac G8 GT placed it in my driveway. It is more than the silky power that keeps a smile on my face, and makes me find more excuses to drive more often. Over 3600 of the 6000 km in the first month of ownership was on a single round trip over mountain highways. Fully loaded with family treasures, we averaged 9.1 L/100 km. Great seat design and driving position allowed two daily legs of 1100 km with complete comfort. The handling inspires confidence and low stress on the twisties and road irregularities. All features demonstrate thoughtful, quality design and manufacturing care."
pontiac,g8,2009,Joe, 09/28/2008,Fun Car,4,"I just picked-up my G8 several days ago (9/24). My dealer had to do a locate and swap for the car to get my color (white exterior/solid onyx interior)and options (18 in all season tires, sunroof and Premium Package).  The fit and finish of this car are perfect.  The interior is done in high end materials and is nicely done.   I knew since this car was designed by GM/Holden to be exported as a right/left driver I would have to deal with window and lock controls on the console (not an issue. Performance is better than I expected for an almost 4000 LB car. This car goes, the ride quality and stopping power speaks to a very well designed automobile. I'm getting 17+ mpg in the city. "
pontiac,g8,2009,Larry , 09/28/2008,So far so good,4,"Only two weeks old, first tank of mixed town & country was 22 mpg.nice firm ride, great handling, quiet/comfortable ride,excellent brakes.Seems to be a good value for the price, but I will wait a few years to make that call. Cannot read the DIC. without reading glasses which I don't drive with. Still trying to get a 19"" rim for the spare, none apparently available yet."
pontiac,g8,2009,Todster, 09/29/2008,A lot of car for the money,4,"This is a phenomenal vehicle for the money and overall I am very pleased with it.  My only complaint is the fact that the vehicle left the factory with a defect (hole) in the gas tank.  It was discovered after a 1600 mile trip to Las Vegas.  After repair I contacted Pontiac's customer service division about the problem from the safety standpoint and they really didn't seem to care.  I love the car, I do not care much for Pontiac Motor Division's so called customer service.  I will probably not purchase another Pontiac product due to this, but the car is a lot of fun."
pontiac,g8,2009,G. Roy, 10/04/2008,Super G8,4,"It's been a long time since I've owned a car that came close to this G8. Unbelievable value and price. The driving experience is outstanding, don't miss the opportunity to test drive this car you'll love it."
pontiac,g8,2009,BobK , 10/18/2008,4 door family vette,5,"I had a Monte Carlo SS which was a great car but I really wanted a V8 sport sedan with rear wheel drive 4 doors and a generous trunk. When the G8- GT came out I waited until the 2009 model and purchased a GT with the sport package and the premium package. This car is everything that I wanted. Great looks. outstanding power, superb handling, exceptional braking, comfortable interior with plenty of room for everybody. I have the color Pacific Slate, which brings many compliments. This car is the best bang for the buck when you compare apples to apples. I am a strong supporter of GM and their products. My wife loves the on star system and the xm radio.   "
pontiac,g8,2009,Tony, 10/20/2008,Love it!,4,"I recently purchased the G8 and so far have nothing but praise! The car is as smooth as silk but when prompted takes of like a cannon, I have owned five mustang GT's including a Cobra and this car would smoke them all! I had my eye on this car when it first came out and do not regret buying it at all. If you're looking for a smooth ride with plenty of power I would suggest you buy this car! You cannot beat the price for what you get!"
pontiac,g8,2009,Danevick, 10/25/2008,I'll never own a BMW again!,4,"Considered the G8 among others including MB C350, BMW 550i. MB too small, 550i too pricey and rode way too rough. The G8 is my 'Goldilocks' car, just right, and 1/2 the price of the Beemer! Can't get over the value for the dollar. Have owned MB, BMW, Lexus before, every time I mash the go pedal the status issue disappears! Mileage on the road was actually 24.5, in town about 16-17 mixed driving. Can't tell when cylinder deactivation happens, but big v8 vibrates at idle like my old Camaro, shouldn't happen today. Lots of room in back for 6+ footers, huge trunk, a great 'family car' that will still open your sinuses from adrenaline when pushed. compliant but firm ride. Buy 1, You won't be sorry!"
pontiac,g8,2009,John, 10/25/2008,My 2009 Pontiac G8 GT,4,Have had the G8 for over 2 months and have about 4000 miles on it. The power is awesome and was great driving in the mountains of Georgia. It is a fantastic car for the cost. I would tell anyone to test drive it and I know they will love it.
pontiac,g8,2009,babygirl, 10/27/2008,Great Graduation Present,4,"My parents got this car for me as a graduation present and I'm loving it.  I went to the dealership to test drive the G6 when the G8 caught my eye. I walked right passed the G6 and asked for the keys to the G8.  By the look of the car I knew I wanted it.  My parents were sold on the fact that it had Onstar. Great car for anyone who likes to go fast.  Before I never liked to drive places, now I volunteer to go anywhere. Great kick and speed for a 6cyl. "
pontiac,g8,2009,scotth3886, 11/03/2008,Fantastic value for the money,5,"As I said in my title fantastic value for the dollar. Feels very much like my friend's 2008 BMW 550 for less than half the money and is actually a little faster. Great road car with great seats. The back seat is probably more comfortable than the front, and it has 7 series room back there. Gas mileage isn't so fantastic, but it deteriorates little with speed and it is more economical around town than my V6 Saturn Aura. I bought the car in Ohio and made a major road trip bringing it back out to Cali for the winter. I couldn't ask for a better vacation car.  A mid 13 second, 170 mph, 22 mpg+ large, four door sports sedan for $31k. I can't complain much about that. "
pontiac,g8,2009,Larry, 11/14/2008,Six week update,4,"Initial review 9-08, since then I purchased a G8 19in rim & tire, fits perfectly in the spare well. Love the seats & seatbelts very comfortable. Still averageing about 20mpg in mixed very easy driving. One tire air pressure sensor failed, quickly replaced by dealer. Only have 1k so far"
pontiac,g8,2009,G8Keeper, 11/20/2008,The G8 is great!,4,"This car is simply an amazing value. It is extremely powerful, roomy, suave and tons of fun to drive. It's family friendly too!  Go buy one, what are you waiting for!? "
pontiac,g8,2009,msufan, 11/23/2008,G8-Late in 08,4,"Great exterior styling, nice cool interior, except for the center battery and oil  display (ugh!). Also, someone forgot to install the trunk sound dampening material lining; the dealer put in 09 sound material. Our 1996 Bonneville SSEi has a heads- up display and I wonder why Pontiac never pushed this and/or continued this cool feature in other models. Anyway, we like our White Hot G8 a lot; and, there aren't that many G8's on the road it seems and that's cool. It drives well, is tight on curves and moves out when you want to. It feels sturdy and solid-well put together."
pontiac,g8,2009,stlembach, 11/24/2008,Awesome!,5,"Unbelevably awesome! The fit and finish of this car is so solid, you would think it was built in Germany. The motor pulls very hard on demand. Yet can be mild bopping around town. The engine management system is seamless. A driver's car!"
pontiac,g8,2009,MichiganJack, 11/28/2008,What a great car!,4,"The G8 GT's performance is amazingly close to my Audi RS 6 (450 hp), which cost $85K in 2003. With a tune I suspect the Audi's only remaining performance advantage would be traction thanks to AWD. If GM had been turning out products like the G8 GT all along, they wouldn't be begging before Congress. "
pontiac,g8,2009,Larry, 12/01/2008,Teriffic value,4,"Update from 9-28:purchased (oem)19in rim & tire, fits perfectly into the spare tire well.R/R air pressure sensor failed, quickly replaced by Pontiac. Mixed very easy driving yielding about 21/22. We don't drive very much these days, so gas mileage not a problem. Fretted about buying an 8 cyl, did not need nor want the extra horses, it just drove better than the 6 cyl. Quieter & many options were standard. Apparently no insurance penalty for the 8 cyl. Love the overall quietness & comfort of this car. Rumor has it GM is ready to do away with Pontiac. Would not have purchased it had I known. If this happens I guess the 5 year 100k warranty will be worthless. Too bad, love the car."
pontiac,g8,2009,Tina, 12/23/2008,My new car has a vibration?,3,"We really thought that we had found our dream car, even though we traded in a 2006 330I BMW. We loved the whole look and feel until we drove our new vehicle home for the first time. Mind you, this vehicle was on the showroom  floor, the odometer read 11 miles. While driving our ""new"" vehicle we first noticed that it did not idle properly and at various speeds between 30-45mph and 50-65mph there is a harmonic vibration. We have spoken with the auto specialist thinking that they would know what was happening since they are familiar with the vehicles they sell. We were told that this is normal for the 6.0L. We do not believe this is normal and we are still currently having these issues today."
pontiac,g8,2009,Overjoyed, 12/26/2008,"Great Car, Great Deal",4,"I had been waiting for this to happen for some time. And it was worth it.  I looked long and hard at the competition - Malibu, Accord, Altima, Camry, Sonata, Lucerne, etc. but this was the winner. I didn't buy it for the rear wheel drive, but for the size and style. It is very sporty looking, agressive even. The interior is clean, uncluttered, and straightforward. The switch gear location, designed to make the switch from right hand drive in Australia, to left hand drive in the US takes some getting used to, but it isn't too big a deal.  I am extremely happy so far, and so glad to be ride of my 2002 Camry. This is a much more exciting car."
pontiac,g8,2009,Cassandra Brown, 12/27/2008,Beautiful car one concern,4,I have had this car for a week now love it. This is my first American made car. Very fun and quick car. What attracted me to this car was it put you in the mind of a BMW and not only that its a pretty red car but the fact is it was not many on the road which could be a bad or good thing but my thought was it would a good thing because it stands out from all the other cars and it does just that. People are always take a second look and comment on how beautiful my G8 GT is.     
pontiac,g8,2009,Jean Baptiste, 01/01/2009,Vacation Time,4,"I love my G8 GT for a lot of reasons. All have been stated many times over in other reviews. However, I have a special reason to like this car. In past years when my wife and I loaded up previously owned cars with maybe 500 lbs of tools and luggage for a few months at our vacation house, I had to shim the rear springs to help keep similar (and safe) driving dynamics. In my G8 GT this past fall, the heavy load had little or no impact on my mormal driving experience. I credit this to the great suspension of this car.     "
pontiac,g8,2009,Brenda, 01/06/2009,Awesome drive,5,"Pontiac G-8 GT is my 3rd Ponitac, and by far the best. I had a 96 Grand Prix GT 2-door for 10 years, traded for a 06 Pontiac Solstice and traded for the 09 Pontiac G8. It is the best car I've ever had, has everything you can possibly think of, design and interior is awsome at night. The best part is the performance, all I can say is wow. "
pontiac,g8,2009,Kolossus, 01/22/2009,"Besides the Judge, Best Pontiac Ever",4,"I bought a 2009 Pontiac G8 GT in White Hot on the 30th of December 2008. So far I have about 800 miles on the OD and the car keeps getting better. Here in the Burgh, the winter is sometimes a hindrance and yet I have had no problems with the rear wheel drive. One just needs to learn the right amount of pressure on the gas pedal and drive safe. I'm still breaking her in and will write more come summer once she's got a few thousand miles."
pontiac,g8,2009,Dave, 01/30/2009,American car?,4,"I have had the car 1 week and LOVE IT! This is the first ""American"" car I have owned in over 20 years and so far, its a keeper. I did not realize how much I missed a V8...except for the gas mileage."
pontiac,g8,2009,GB, 01/31/2009,"Unbeatable performance, style, and value",4,"Very nice interior and exterior styling with good fit and finish inside and out. Powerful engine with great V8 sound track and smooth power delivery. Wonderful driving dynamics. Very comfortable heated seats, nice interior materials, great sound system. Averaging 19 MPG in cold & snowy conditions with snow tires."
pontiac,g8,2009,jshane111, 02/07/2009,Love my G8 GT,4,"After owning foriegn for a while, I was leery about buying American again after being burnt by quality issue in the past.  However, after test driving Acuras we tried the G8 GT and fell in love.  The design, quality, and of course the performance are GREAT!  I know I should have look for better gas milage, but when you can have this much fun, this much perfoemance, and still get 25 MPG what the heck.  It's a great car at a great price, way to go GM!!!"
pontiac,g8,2009,Scott, 02/11/2009,Perfect car for me,4,"The G8 GT has everything I was looking for in a car - high end looks, great performance, good price, and a domestic make.  Fuel mileage is good relative to the performance, but if the first thing you check out on a car are the EPA ratings - this car is not for you.  I get great feedback from others on the car and enjoy driving it.  My other new car choices were foreign makes but the domestic G8 delivers on all counts."
pontiac,g8,2009,kd, 02/24/2009,A winner too late for Pontiac?,4,"Reality demanded I spend less than originally planned for a new car. I am very happy to have chosen so much car for the money. The GT looks cool, drives tight and has the most comfortable front seat of my better cars (TL, 300M, Aurora, Legend). I can mention some constructive improvements others have documented, but with research, you know these before you buy, such as the weak sound system, lack of some amenities and weird controls. The only issue after 2 months besides still not having the second set of keys lost by the dealer, is an annoying vibrating noise randomly coming from behind the glove box. We will see if it can be addressed by the dealer before commenting on GM build quality."
pontiac,g8,2009,White Lighting, 02/24/2009,Excitement back at Pontiac,4,"This car is fast, really fast.  There isn't another car in this price range that even comes close to the fun, the speed, the features and the comfort. You just can't buy a big, 5 adult fitting car that can do the quarter mile under 14 seconds and reach 60 mph in under 6 seconds for anything close to $30,000.  Not only is it great in a straight line, but it corners great as well.  It has a huge trunk, and the stereo is as loud and as clear as any factory stereo I've ever heard. Yeah, the fuel mileage isn't great, but it exactly what I expected and gets the fuel mileage that is advertised.  "
pontiac,g8,2009,Rex, 03/01/2009,A lot of car and fun for the money,4,"I had been researching my new car purchase for well over a year before I decided on the G8 GT. The overall feel of the car is great. It has plenty of power and just as important it has plenty of back seat leg room, 6'+ adults are quite comfortable. I've owned the car for 2 months now and accumulated over 3500 miles. Average mileage has been 18 mpg but I have not had much highway time yet. Taking a 1000 trip in two weeks so that will tell me what the real mileage is like."
pontiac,g8,2009,Chris D, 02/26/2009,Awesome Ride,5,"I bought this car to replace my aging Trans Am.  I am completely overjoyed with this sporty sedan...perfect blend of speed and comfort.  Everything about this car is outstanding, from appearance, to acceleration, to creature comforts, to gas mileage, and so on.  The size of the car is just right for handling, while the space provided for the driver and adult passengers in more than sufficient.  The trunk is huge!  The best part (of course) is when my friends review the car and then stand in total amazement when I tell them the cost -- very reasonable for everything you get.  I can't believe I don't see more of this caron the road...people don't know what they're missing!"
pontiac,g8,2009,dudeman135, 03/07/2009,Love My 09 G8 GT!,4,"I purchased my new Maverick Silver Metallic 09 G8 GT about a month ago with all available options and wow. I've never owned a V8 prior to the G8 and am quite impressed.  It's such a fun car to drive and was pleasantly surprised with the gas mileage.  I averaged 22MPG on the first tank, 21MPG on the 2nd tank and 19 on the 3rd which is after I got through the break-in period and discovered the button to turn traction control off.  ;)  The ride is super smooth and refined.  The exhaust is quiet until you slam on the gas, then you get the nice throaty exhaust note you would expect from a 6 liter V8.  So far the G8 GT is exactly what I was looking for.  Awesome ride!"
pontiac,g8,2009,JCP, 03/08/2009,Screaming Bargain,5,"After looking for a used G8 GT and considering other mid sized vehicles, the dealer offered me a new G8 for about what a used one would cost.  I love being able to blow off ANY Acura's, Infinity's, Lexus's, and most BMW's at a fraction of their cost.  Gas mileage on the first three tanks is 21 with a mix of city/hwy/and quite a few WOT demos for friends and family.Should improve as it gets broken in.Handling is great and the ride is a good compromise, interior space is better than anything else in this price range. Anyone considering a midsize/large vehicle should drive the GT, as it is, by far, the best value in the market today.In the future the government will outlaw cars this fun!"
pontiac,g8,2009,admonite, 03/08/2009,first 1000 miles down,4,I love the car. It has excellent looks. Has the best quality feel of any car I've owned American or Import. The power is excellent. I opted for the 6 cylinder and it is actually more powerful than I need. I took a drive this morning with 5 full grown adults in the car and it still pushes everyone back into their seats accelerating with normal driving.
pontiac,g8,2009,Don, 03/12/2009,Great ride,4,"Bought in Jan and love the ride and quick steering response.  I have one issue with the car.  It sounds and feels like the engine ""flutters"" when I am cruising down the road, whether I'm going 20 or 65MPH.  As soon as I give it a little bit of gas it goes away and evens out. Dealer told me it was the norm for this car.  Does anyone else have this issue?  Getting about 19.8 MPG avg and performance and responsiveness is great..just have the flutter."
pontiac,g8,2009,Bryan, 03/14/2009,Best GM car ever,4,"ive owned a lot of cars from GM, this has to be the best one yet, i owned a 05 pontiac bonneville GXP that was alright, at best, this cars handleing is great, the steering is perfect, suspension is perfect in cornering and just relaxing on the highway, brakes are great, great design inside and out, feels well built, the power from the V8 is endless, would like a little more of a louder exhaust note, and the window switches should be on the doors, but those small things dont really wreck a absolutly great car"
pontiac,g8,2009,Bill H, 03/18/2009,Thunder from Down-Under,4,"Mine's grey metallic with Sunroof and Premium Pkg options; 3 mos. old and approaching 3K mi. Here briefly (because it will repeat what many have already stated)are the pluses: great car for the $$s; excellent warranties; great straight-line or twisty roads'performance; '87' grade gas with good mileage (hey! It's a V8!) if you properly manage your right foot; nice seating front & back; couple strangers saying 'Nice looking car'.  My great deal included dealer adding the Sport Pkg's bright pedals,swapping the GT's dull 18"" wheels w/summer only tires with the bright, best looking ones w/all season tires off a base G8 and a compact spare.  "
pontiac,g8,2009,GXP_CraZy, 03/17/2009,Get One If You Can,4,"It was definitely worth the wait.  This is the best performing car for the money out of the box.  Great road trip car and when you get tired of cruising, grip the wheel and mash the pedal.  If you can latch on to one you won't be disappointed.  An aftermarket exhaust really wakes the beast and gives it a much more respectable tone."
pontiac,g8,2009,Terry, 03/22/2009,Replaces a BMW for half the price,5,"I bought this car to replace my troublesome BMW M3 and to be able to give the family more room.  Well I can honestly say its done this and more! The car is great, and seriously CAN NOT BE BEAT for the price! $65,000 for a comprable 5 series BMW or $29,000 for one that can spank it and has more room.  This is what I call a ""no brainer""   Keep up the great work GM!"
pontiac,g8,2009,Hitman1970, 03/27/2009,Sport Red Metallic G8 GT,4,"This car is a complete joy to drive.  This is my first true sports sedan and I love it.  So far I have received multiple unsolicited compliments driving this car around town.  Fun and practical.  The back seat and trunk are bigger than my last vehicle, 2006 Buick LaCrosse CXS.  "
pontiac,g8,2009,Pammiesue1, 03/26/2009,Awsome !,4,"I just picked up my new '09 . I love it ! Very fast, fun, and looks hot ! I had a Lexus RX 330 fot trade which I was very happy with, but this is the car . I like it better than my old Lexus IS 300 . Lot's of room. Bluetooth would be the only thing I would like to have. It seems well built and sturdy . I am happy with my first American car ! 100% I would buy again"
pontiac,g8,2009,JSBMWMAN, 03/31/2009,I switched from a BMW 545i,4,"Just purchased a Panther Metalic Black Onix/Red G8 GT. Did a lot of research and test driving prior to buying on 3- 30-09. I am 52 Yrs old and owned/driven nothing but Porsche,BMW, and Mercedes most of my adult life. I am a total Car Fanatic and love to drive. For the overall driver the BMW is by far the best, but it comes at a price. My most recent BMW was a 545i which I purchased new in '05. I started getting tired of the cost of owning these cars and drove the G8 GT two months ago, and was hooked. It is far from a BMW or Mercedes in terms of luxury and overall ride, but for the $ the G8 GT was good enough to convert me. It is a total buyers market, now is a great time to buy."
pontiac,g8,2009,whoosierdaddy, 04/03/2009,G8 Has It All,4,"Have put 1000 miles on it. Car feels very solid but nimble. This is the only car I could find that has great handling plus a great ride at a low price--every other car make you pick any 2 of those. Averaging 18mpg in city/suburban driving, haven't done a long highway trip yet. V8 was fun but V6 has all the power I need."
pontiac,g8,2009,Big and Bold, 04/02/2009,Most fun for the money,5,"I now own one of the most fun vehicles on the road.  It is a great looking car in black that causes people to stare and ask what I'm driving.  It is fast and handles better than any other big car I've owned.  I've owned a 300C and SRT-8 Jeep.  I planned to purchase a SRT Charger or Challenger but was turned off by dealers over price.  I drove the G8 and fell in love.  It handles better, is almost as fast as the SRT8 and it more comfortable.  It cost less plus, I don't see it everywhere I look on the road.  OnStar is great with turn-by-turn and the layout is perfect.  The G8 drifts great, pulls strong off the line.  I've suprised a few vehicles on the road who try and challenge the mighty G."
pontiac,g8,2009,Rob, 04/10/2009,Former GTO Owner,4,"I traded my GTO for the G8.  Much smoother and quieter and feels quicker around town. No problems so far, have owned for just over 2 months. Lots of room.  Stereo speakers could be of better quality and wished the interior was available in other colors besides black.  Interior looks good though and seats are very comfy. Really like the car and glad I bought it. Very fun to drive. No regrets."
pontiac,g8,2009,TxNessie84, 04/13/2009,Amazing Pontiac,5,This is one amazing car and one of the best bargains in cars anywhere. This car will outperform a lot of cars costing a lot more money. Everyone who sees it and rides in it loves it and thinks it cost a lot more than it did.
pontiac,g8,2009,James Bounds, 04/11/2009,One Wasn't Enough!,4," I was interested in getting my wife a replacement for her high mileage Altima.  She just thought her Nissan V-6 was fast! On the test drive I was driving... I punched it and WOW!!..she was sold!and so was I!...We both bought one! Mine silver, Hers,dark red.The looks are head turning...We hear over and over, ""looks like a BMW""..For the money this car cannot be beat! Mileage wise 24mpg hwy.. haven't checked city hwy combined. The extra few dollars for gas, well worth the FUN!"
pontiac,g8,2009,Geo, 04/18/2009,Sweet.,4,Love the car.  Replaced a G8 GXP.  Very refined.  Very spacious.  Very quick. Terrible in the snow.  I will need to buy snow tires next season for the first time in 30 years.
pontiac,g8,2009,Ron, 04/21/2009,Great value driver's car,4,"I have the 2009 SRM G8 GT with premium and sports.  This is a driver's car, and is amazingly nimble for its size.  The interior can be nicer, but that is not the reason why people buy this car.  The AFM when engaged adds vibration.  As a previous reviewer commented, the idle is a bit rough, but that is true of most cars with the LS series push rod engine.  The handling is excellent for such a big car.  It beats my previous front-heavy Accord V6 hands down.  And the V8 engine propels the car to highway speeds in a blink of the eye.  Unfortunately, the price one pays for such performance is high fuel consumption.  All-in-all, driving this car is a blast and surprisingly comfortable.  Great car."
pontiac,g8,2009,Gary, 04/21/2009,"You best be ""Holden"" on for this ride",5,"Ok, all humor aside, this is a great car. It's fast, nimble, quiet, does what it does better than anyone else, for half the price, and I can't believe how many people ask me about it. This is quite an experience, sort of like dancing with the hottest person at the dance, and knowing you're definitely being envied. It's a very great car, which goes a long way to show that GM does it right, too bad most people don't realize just how well they do it. I love this car, it's easy to drive, simple in execution and delivery. What an AMAZING machine! "
pontiac,g8,2009,D. Cooper, 04/24/2009,GRRREATT G8,5,I Love My G8. I was waiting for the Camaro to come out but came across the G8 and fell in love. It looks means and corners great. Everybody asks me what it is or if its a BMW or Mercedes. I love the look of the interior especially the radio. We were driving a 2500 diesel so we chose the V6. But now I want the V8. So who knows I might be upgrading. Mines Black on Black. 
pontiac,g8,2009,Teresa, 04/28/2009,Awesome Car,4,"Looking at buying a BMW & saw this car (only on one commercial). Thought I would give it a look, after a test drive I was sold. It is an awesome car. Totally fun to drive. I have had many people ask ""what car is that"". Many heads have turned. I purchased the white G8 and had the windows tinted. I love this car even my husband wants to drive it all the time. Great car for the money, lot of room inside & in the trunk. I would recommend this car to anyone."
pontiac,g8,2009,thebigb, 04/28/2009,Get out of my way,4,"Oh my goodness, what a fast car! Last car I owned which even came close to the speed in this car was a 1986 Corvette. This car is truly a 4 door Corvette. Looked at a CTS with DI, but this baby was the one. No contest. I have no problem with GM folding Pontiac, it only made my GXP worth more down the line. This car should have been on sale 4 years ago and GM would not be in the trouble they are today."
pontiac,g8,2009,Ken, 04/28/2009,My G8 Toy,4,"Purchased this vehicle in February.I am thoroughly pleased with decision to buy it. This is the 1st Pontiac I have ever owned. Im looked at the BMW 3 series, Infinity and the Mercedes C300. The performance of this vehicle is stunning...it grips curves like like glue. The ride is even better than I expected for a sports sedan. The body style is an eye catcher and turn quite a few heads when I ride by. Thus far gas mileage is a combo of city-highway of 22 mpg Cons: would like to have had a home- link transmitter and better access to adjust the driver's seat."
pontiac,g8,2009,DevdogHP, 04/28/2009,Fun BMW killer...,4,"On my test drive I had the pleasure of leaving both a BMW 550 and a WRX on the same stretch of I-95.  Wonderful selling point...people say it is the best car for the money, I say it is the perfect car.  "
pontiac,g8,2009,hitman1970, 04/30/2009,"Best Car I Have Owned. Fun, Fun, Fun!",4,I bought this car on 17 MAR 2009.  After a test drive I was sold.  The handling characteristics are fabulous. It looks great in Sport Metallic Red.  This is one of those cars that people will still talk about in twenty years. Great value. Great performance.
pontiac,g8,2009,Leviathan, 05/04/2009,Incredible and now rare beauty!,5,"Just over a week adn 200 miles on my new 2009 G8 GXP in MGM with a A6. From the great 6.2l V* to the remarkable auto 6 speed to the surpsingly good sound system, this car does not disappoint. I will be able to really enjoy the car once I get through the self control testing initial break in period. I must control my right foot!!!"
pontiac,g8,2009,jshaag, 05/23/2009,Best of the best,4,"I have owned 4 previous Pontiacs and this is by far the best ever.  Incredible power for a ""family sedan"".  Smooth acceleration and amazing pick up.  My friend just bought a BMW a few months prior and he envies my Pontiac.  Fuel economy is what you would expect with this much power. "
pontiac,g8,2009,sporkdude, 05/27/2009,Best car I've ever owned,4,"Fantastic car. Extremely powerful and handles very well. I didn't like where some of the controls were, like the cruise control and the window/locks being on the center console. I expected a bit better out of the sounds system, my G6 in my opinion had a much better sound and much deeper, more powerful bass."
pontiac,g8,2009,Extender32, 05/30/2009,Mustang Killer,5,"I had bought a fusion orange G8 GT just last year but but after learning about the demise of Pontiac, I thought it was time to upggrade to the GXP.  The car is quick (about as quick as my 06' GTO)and the exhaust note is super too when you mash the petal. The GT was flawless for the 10,000 miles and the fuel mileage was acceptable (24 MPG to/from work).  I don't expect that there will be any problems with the GXP either."
pontiac,g8,2009,Headhound, 05/31/2009,The Best Yet,5,"I evaluated the V8 versions of Audi A6, BMW550, Hyundai Genesis, Lexus GS460, Nissan, and Cadillac before I bought. G8 drove better, handled better, and accelerated better than the others. Traded in my BMW540 and am very happy with my choice. Superb acceleration, superior handling, great braking, over 21 MPG on regular gas, comfortable seating, and roomy trunk for half the price of the competition. Only car I have ever had where I did not wish I had more power. "
pontiac,g8,2009,Carqwik, 06/03/2009,BMW 4 Less!,4,"The car Pontiac should have always had!  It's a true American (despite Oz origins) sport sedan that can run with most of the imports costing up to twice as much.  Yea, it's not a lux mobile, but the V8 power, the acceleration, the handling (surprise - it has excellent road manners), and the perfect size makes it an excellent value!"
pontiac,g8,2009,WiG8GT, 06/05/2009,G8GT 2 month review,4,"I love driving the car.  The suspension has the right combination of firmness for good handling but not so stiff that you get beat up.  Plenty of room in the back seat, we can all sit up with out hitting our heads, one of the reasons we purchased this over the CTS.  The mileage is about 18.5 mixed, we have 2800 miles on it."

pontiac,g8,2009,Sport Red, 06/07/2009,Best of the Last,4,"GM has ""mothballed"" the Pontiac brand indefinitely, but too soon!  The Pontiac G8 is the best car GM has produced in my lifetime, that's nearly 60 years, and from the looks of the near future offerings, it will be my whole lifetime!  This car has great performance, outstanding styling, excellent build quality, and for a high HP V8, very acceptable fuel mileage.  If you want one of your own, you best hurray!  Even thou Pontiac will be around until the end of '10, the G8s will be gone long before that!"
pontiac,g8,2009,Clay Garland, 06/08/2009,Mine is actually a Manual,4,"Stunning car.  I was in the market for a new car, and I was shopping at the Nissan dealership because I loved my G35.  Next door, there was a Pontiac dealership, and I remember being enamored with the the styling of the G8, but when I had first seen them they weren't available in a manual which is a deal breaker.  Well, the GXP was out, and it was available in a six speed, and it was incredible.  I walked out of the dealership with the new car that day.  It was White, and traditionally, I'd never have purchased a white car, but I didn't care.  This was the beauty with the beats under the bonnet."
pontiac,g8,2009,Nebbieman, 06/08/2009,great pontiac,4,"This car gets looked at all the time,looked at the sport red but wife spotted the pacific slate metallic and sold me on it.runs and handles great power reminds me of muscle car days to bad gm stop doing them"
pontiac,g8,2009,Ray, 06/09/2009,Satisfied G8 owner,4,Sorry to see Pontiac fade away when they finally have a fleet of good and exciting vehicles to sell. I hope some of the legacy will be picked up and rebadged under Chevy or Buick. The G8 hit the sweet spot for me.
pontiac,g8,2009,kselbig, 06/11/2009,Great after 7 months,4,"Posted earlier, loved it then, love it now.  Very disappointed that Pontiac will be going away.  Buy one of these cars if a car for you is not just a means of transportation.  It is a blast to drive, even in V-6 form.  I got the upgraded interior and 6 disc CD player.  I have received as many compliments about this car as my 2000 Corvette, maybe more."
pontiac,g8,2009,Irish, 06/15/2009,Pontiac G8 Gt,4,"Have had a problem with the parking brake not releasing has been to the dealer 2 times for this problem, was told there is nothing wrong.They said they replaced it I still have the problem. Their suggestion was my wife pulled it too tight, It was only pulled tight enough to hold the car on a hill. this is probably a design flaw that Gm either is not aware of or not willing to repair. "
pontiac,g8,2009,Alan, 06/15/2009,Best for the money,4,"I have been a GM customer for years, owning a number of cars that were primarily just for transportation.  The exception was my 1984 Buick Regal T Type (same as the Grand National, only in blue with chrome bumpers). I contemplated the G8 GT for quite some time I and finally purchased the same day that I helped my son buy a new Sierra.  With all the GM incentives and my GM card points, I got the 34K car for 25k; how could I go wrong? Even the dealer said I could probably sell it for more than I paid. I think the styling, especially from a distance, is fantastic and the interior is beautiful; so the leather isn't on the doors, who cares?  For a large 4 door sedan, it is impossible to beat."
pontiac,g8,2009,Tim K, 06/18/2009,6 is enough,4,"Solid automobile,,,,competes with a buddy's 3 Series BMW,  but thousands less....alot of people ask me about the car.....hugs corners, road and body.......big trunk for golf, etc....V6 delivers everything I need.....get 23 combined city-highway"
pontiac,g8,2009,Cyrus - TX, 06/21/2009,Incredible Car -- Its GRRRR8T!,4,"This is absolutely an incredible car!  Finally Pontiac has gotten it right -- unfortunately right before it has to close its doors.  If you are considering buying this car, now is the time and you will not be disappointed.  Caveat--If you are looking for great gas mileage, buy a Honda, but if you want awesome performance with very decent gas mileage...this is your ride.  It will get better mileage with additional after market mods(check the internet), which signficantly increases the horse power too. As a family sedan and sports car...I think your getting the best of both worlds."
pontiac,g8,2009,jjg, 06/24/2009,Pontiact: Say it ain't so!,4," This car snaps.  It's tight and comfortable.  One does not know what it has to offer until one drives it.  It is fun and fast, and unassuming:  No one knows what it it until it roars in speed if not sound!  The premium sports model keeps one interested; and OH!  How I love the DIC, in all its guises.  Please transfer this gem to chev  It is different enough from the crouched, sporty Camero to deserve a life of its own.  If it goes to Buick, expect it to be 4or 5K more expensive.  Perhaps, it needs its own,new brand!  Don't let this baby archive.  GM would be absolutely insane."
pontiac,g8,2009,JOE S., 06/24/2009,WOW WOW,4,"Had 07 300 SRT8, 05 CTS-V, The best car for the money hands down...sold both cars in search of the best of all worlds...AND I FOUND IT IN THE G8 GXP.....love this car....  "
pontiac,g8,2009,Bill, 06/30/2009,Vicious and Delicious,4,I love being able to roll up next to someone driving an Acura or Infiniti or BMW 3/5 series and then smoke them off the line.  They had no idea.  I've not had one problem with the car.  The best experience is driving this car around town and everyone looking at it because you don't see these cars everyday..  And the ride is very comfortable.
pontiac,g8,2009,PeaRat450, 06/30/2009,Why must Pontiac die?,4,"I just purchased a 2009 Pontiac G8 with the 3.6L V-6 a couple of days ago, and I'm saddened that GM is killing Pontiac. This car is absolutely the best car I have ever owned. I honestly feel that this is also the closest GM has ever come to the BMW 3 series. If Pontiac has to die, then why can't Chevrolet pick up the G8 as a Chevelle or something. At the price this car is an unbeatable bargain, and if I had the money I would by another one tomorrow (a GT). The only change I would like to see is for the 300hp direct injected V-6 to be installed. Then it would be absolutely perfect."
pontiac,g8,2009,Mitch, 07/01/2009,Loving My Liquid Red G8 GT!,4,"I bought this car after test driving a handful of cars. This one put all of them to shame, including a Camaro SS that I test drove! The interior is slick and once you get used to the climate and audio controls, it's easy to get to the stuff you want. On the outside, the car looks absolutely fantastic. I love my 19"" machined-face rims. I have gotten so many looks and so much attention from people! From stares on the street, to people staring at me from their cars, and even one guy pulling up next to me and honking at me to roll my window down so he could ask me about it! This baby hauls too! You will pay for all the fun with your gas, though. I don't know, I think it's totally worth it!"
pontiac,g8,2009,JT, 07/01/2009,G8 GT is Simply Amazing,4,"What a shame.  GM finally gives us this wonderful car, and POOF, it is no more.  I purchased my 2009 G8 GT in June of 2009 after much thought and consideration.  I ended up choosing this car over the BMW 550i.   I am simply amazed by the car.  The stupid grin that refuses to leave my face when I am driving the car is priceless.  At 6'4"" and around 300 lbs, I find the car very comfortable.  There is also plenty of room in the back seat.  This car is all about the drive.  It handles amazingly well, and the acceleration will astonish you.  I never thought I would buy a GM product, but I am so glad I did.  I am now a reformed brand snob. I love this car!"
pontiac,g8,2009,Go Red G8 GT, 07/07/2009,Best car for the Bang get one!,4,"4 days and love it I can't get out of it, bought it brand new 2009 GT model. The red is hot and turns heads. the v8 6.0 omg it rocks when a sedan goes 0- 60 5.3 all I can say is wow for the money best bang for the buck! got the sport package and let me say this, its a mean cat with claws and this baby grabs and goes, goes and goes, I'm talking about the tires 245/40R19 allot of traction is not saying enough. another thing I wanted allot of room for 4 adults I can get 3 in the back no problem and leg room np, height np. ok, blapuk system 11 speakers and sub woffer please 11 speakers come, the sound is perfect. get one and you will be happy!

pontiac,g8,2009,Panama Jack, 07/09/2009,Unbelievable,5,I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT!I LOVE IT! Traded in my 3 Series and I have no regrets. This car is truly amazing... Don't pass up the opportunity to get your hands on one of these cars before they are all gone.
pontiac,g8,2009,Patrick, 07/12/2009,Perfect,4,"Absolutely a blast to drive. The power is always on tap, and the acceleration is fast yet smooth. The car sticks to the road very well, and though the suspension is sporty, it's not overly stiff or uncomfortable. Some controls take a bit of getting used to, but after a month it's not a problem."
pontiac,g8,2009,Dvick, 07/12/2009,Awesome Aussie-Gett one quick!,5,"Bought this car in July 09; blows away my friends BMW 550i for 1/2 the $$- Have 13k on the car, absolutely love it- can't beleive GM is gonna pull the plug when they finally got it right. More interior room than a BMW 750i, More trunk space, super comfy, great handler, V8 hauls. Have had all the imports, BMW, Merc, Lexus,Infiniti, this one tops them all. Enjoy driving it so much I took the family to Vegas in it, 3k miles total, averaged 24 mpg @ 85+mph loaded to the gills across the desert! In town expect 15-16 mpg. I am seriously considering buying another just to mothball for when I run this one into the ground! GM- PLEASE keep this car, maybe as a Chevy Impala?  Try one, you'll love it!"
pontiac,g8,2009,Jeff Zabo, 07/15/2009,09 G8 GT Awesome !!,5,"I read all the reviews and I have to say that the G8 GT is all that I could have hoped for.  Mileage is unbelievably good.  Through the old miles driven divided by gallons used, my lowest tank has been 18.4 while the highest was 24.9(all highway, 70- 80mph).  I look at the computer's mileage, and it's close, but usually higher than actual.  The power is addictive.  The car is quiet quiet quiet !  Fit and finish are really good, doors close with german exactness.  This is a driver's car, it doesn't come with tons of gadgets that you don't need, about the only thing I've missed is my auto dimming mirrors.  The car is a hot rod in family disguise...love it..."
pontiac,g8,2009,Jerry, 07/16/2009,Best GM Car in Years,5,The G8 is an excellent vehicle overall. It drives and performs like a muscle car with the luxury of the best. I constantly get comments from people in parking lots and thumbs up from others on the highway. GM must keep this vehicle in the lineup even if it is rebadged. Great job GM!
pontiac,g8,2009,Gr8GT, 07/16/2009,Bimmer 550 in Sheep's Clothing,4,"I bought this car (G8 GT) 2 months ago after test driving my father's and just loving it.  I got an excellent price from the Pontiac dealership who seemed to want to give these cars away.   This car has everything I admire about the BMW 5-series:  power to spare, aggressive styling, refined ride, an extremely rich set of features, and even a little cachet (I still don't see too many of these models on the road).  And just as important, it doesn't have the one thing that is synonomous with all BMW's, a large price tag.  Anyone who is interested in owning a BMW 550 at half the price should seriously consider the G8 GT.  "
pontiac,g8,2009,vegassam66, 07/20/2009,What a shame,4,"Just bought my first American car in 25 years and I come to find that GM is killing it.  No wonder they are bankrupt.  GM listen to your customers not the bean counters.  I have just bought mine three days ago and an in love with it.  The performace for the dollar is second to none, and I don't mind driving in rush hour traffic."
pontiac,g8,2009,GT Oh G8, 07/21/2009,GT Oh G8,5,"Lot's of LOOKs for this Very Very Red GT G8.  Great ride, quiet, loads of fun, quick, agile, giant back seat - leg room and then some.  Wonderful gas mileage - 18 mpg plus.  Nice Blaupunkt stereo SiriusXM Radio is great.  I really like the OnStar for handsfree calling and directions when needed (you get to talk to a REAL person)."
pontiac,g8,2009,RBM, 07/28/2009,Excellent Vehicle,5,"I am truly amazed with this car and all I keep thinking is I wish I could afford to buy another one. I have to work out an arrangement with my wife so we both get time with it. The car is so comfortable and familiar feeling that you don't realize how much you miss it until yoo get in another car. The ride is superb, the fit and feel of the seats is the best I have ever experienced and the power....wow. As others have said get one while you can, this car is fantastic. It turns as many heads as any sports car twice it's price. Liquid Red!"
pontiac,g8,2009,Daniel, 07/30/2009,Why Wouldn't You,5,"Fiance ended up pregnant and owned a 96 Chevy Pickup, so had to get something more family friendly. The second i saw this car i knew i had to have it, then saw the price and knew i could have it. Every time i drive it i hope someone will test it, suprisingly no takers after 4 months. First day i bought the car it was raining and took my neighbor for a ride, stomped on it every chance i got in sport mode and regular mode, not one slip from the tires with traction control on. "
pontiac,g8,2009,GR8WHITEHOT, 07/31/2009,THE GR8 WHITE HOT,5,"The Pontiac G8 GT is a phenomenal creation of performance, value, and yes a family sedan. My wife and I traded our 2008 Lexus IS 250 for this modern day muscle car. She rides quiet and smooth until provoked by your right foot, then she'll growl at you. A Corvette with 4 doors for well under 30k  unheard of, until now.   "
pontiac,g8,2009,Doug, 08/06/2009,Love it so far,4,"I've only owned the car for 2 weeks, but I love how it looks (except fake hood scoops), rides & drives. Lot of room, decent Blaupunkt stereo. Power & torque are addictive, but also getting 21 mpg on mostly highway driving. Rare vehicle, so you don't see yourself coming & going. "
pontiac,g8,2009,roadrunner, 08/04/2009,g8isgreat,4,Super car for the money. I buy a new car every year and this is the best one I've had in 15 years. No problems since I took delivery. My average mpg 16.9.
pontiac,g8,2009,Larry, 07/23/2009,pacific slate has been great,5,"Update from 12-08,purchased new 9- 08.G8 continues to perform flawlessly,was able to do a home oil & filter change(simple no problem d  riving on ramps).19 in tires were wearing more on out side of tires. had a 4 wheel allignment done underwarranty, hope that works, tires are pricey.Gas mileage has remained pretty constant averaging about 20 mpg in my mixed driving. Like some other reviews I really hope GM finds a way to save this car(Ihave faith in bob lutz)we have seriously considered a second g8., but at 67 I doubt it."
pontiac,g8,2009,Tyson, 08/07/2009,Fun to Drive,5,"This car is fun to drive, handles well, and gets relatively good gas mileage. So far I have about 1600 miles on it.  I wish it is not being discontinued with Pontiac.  I wouldn't mind replacing my Grand Prix with another G8."
pontiac,g8,2009,Cameron, 08/08/2009,I love this car!!!,4,"The title says it all.  This car is awesome!  I get compliments on it all the time, and I've had it less than a month. Coming from a Nissan Maxima, I considered purchasing the Infiniti G35 as well as the BMW 3 series as well, and neither comes close in terms of bang for buck. What took you so long, Pontiac???"
pontiac,g8,2009,Dave, 08/10/2009,Pontiac G8 GT 6.0,4,"This is my first Pontiac. What a performer this car is. Eats everything on the road, can't keep my foot out of it. I bet it does get great gas mileage but I wouldn't know that yet cause I can't keep my foot out of it. Beautiful to look at in the Stryker blue I bought it in. This car is a rush to drive, feels so tight but yet refine ride. Massive power on tap all the time, with the TC off and a light power brake easily smokes those sticky summer performance tires. I wish I was rich so I could buy another one to stash away for a collector. I know these cars will be worth 10 times there sales price someday, so if you have one take good care it. If you don't you had better hurry up and get one."
pontiac,g8,2009,Car Guy, 08/08/2009,4 Door Muscle Car.,4,"I have the car 2 weeks and have around 900miles on it. I have always been a car guy and have owned many cars including 5 series BMW, E series Mercedes & an Audi Cabriolet for comparison purposes. This car is unbelievable; in terms of pure off the line speed, it blows the doors off anything I have owned(including a 69 firebird with a 400 engine). Handling compares adequately to my BMW and Audi, a lot better then the Benz. The nice thing about this car is there aren't many out there so it is definitely unique, a head turner. The interior is plain but usable, the controls are adequate. In terms of styling, the car has great lines. I am 6ft and there is plenty of leg room front & back, big trunk"
pontiac,g8,2009,Chris, 08/10/2009,2009 Pontiac G8 4dr Sedan ( 3.6 6cyl ),5,"Two Thumbs up!! Have owned several luxury cars before. ( BMW 300 series as well as a Lexus ) The Pontiac G8 Rules! One of the quietest cars that I have ever been. G8 also in the V6 has some "" Get up and go"" power! I have gotten so many compliments on this car."
pontiac,g8,2009,Nick, 08/11/2009,WOW!!!! Sit back and hold on!!,5,"I think I got the last one in the midwest. Whatever, I think there were only 1823 built. Still working on that one. This car is ridiculous, a 3900 lb. car 0-60 in 4.5? Yes. I'm 55, this is the best, most fun car I have ever owned, and I've owned some, from corvettes to T-bird Super Coupes that were not stock, very fast. This thing is it. Even the Stereo is ridiculous. Oh, by the way, I could care less what the gas mileage is. Wonder what this sucker will bring at the Mecum Auction in 15 years when all the muscle cars are gone????"
pontiac,g8,2009,Amanda, 08/11/2009,Love my new TOY!!,4,"When you're a 25 year old female driving this car, you get a lot of looks!  My husband and I have an El Camino and Camaro that we normally take to car shows, but after so many questions about my daily driver, we started taking the G8.  The Stryker Blue paint job really sets it apart."
pontiac,g8,2009,gr2ar, 08/16/2009,2009 Pontiac G8,4,"I really like this car.  The external design is awesome looking!  The inside is nice and there aren't many blind spots, either.  I am averaging 22 mpg on the highway but have received 27 mpg!  I get 18 mpg in the city.  The car has about 1200 miles on it now.  "
pontiac,g8,2009,Tentative, 08/24/2009,Feeling tentative,4,Purchased 3 weeks ago and spent last week in the shop.  Initially told the fuel pump was bad.  Dealer ordered fuel pump.  Now we find out there are 2 fuel pumps and another is on order. Looks like I will have spent 1/2 of my ownership in the shop.  The car isn't even tagged yet!  Hope I don't have a lemon...
pontiac,g8,2009,RWD-V8, 08/19/2009,Best Car I've Ever Driven/Owned,5,"After quite a bit of research, I purchased a slate blue, G8 GXP with a manual transmission.   It's truly a Corvette for a family of five.  It has more space, the same or better performance and is more fun to drive then an M5.  I'm not interested in tons of electronics that will only fail and cause problems.  This car is such fun to drive, I will never sell it. The fuel economy is great for the power/performance level.  I get 20-22 mpg in mixed driving with the manual trans!"
pontiac,g8,2009,Zambini, 09/03/2009,"Yes, this was the car I expected.",4,"Exactly what I expected it to be after reading the literature and tons of reviews.  It is a great ride, and very willing to perform.  A few minor oddities, like the cup holder placement and lack of courtesy lights for rear passengers, but nothing that affects the overall drive-ability.  It is a shame it was cut.  It was destined to be a top performer in the GM line. "
pontiac,g8,2009,JPK, 09/07/2009,"Rear Wheel Drive ""Dominator""",4,"I have almost a year of experience with my 09 G8/GT. I am 63 years old and have owned many vehicles. My G8/GT has more bang for the buck than any of them. I get many positive comments on this vehicle for its looks and the way it goes down the road. Many of these comments are from people (including women) who have very little interest in cars. People ask me all the time, what is it.      I have had NO problems with this vehicle. This car is quiet and smooth as a big Cadillac under normal acceleration. Get on the""Loud Pedal"" and it will definitely put a smile on your face.      The head and leg room (front and back seats) is very good and the seats are very comfy. "
pontiac,g8,2009,Doug, 09/11/2009,Awesome 4 door performance car,4,"The GT performance package provides the best of both worlds I was looking for ...  a quiet and refined 26mpg freeway ride to work and 0-60 in 5.3s performance car with exceptional handling on the 19"" wheel package.  Corners at 30-40 are a blast, not to mention highway ramps.  I love how the vehicle's manual mode really lets the car perform. Its balancing is exceptional. It's ashame GM didn't come out earlier with this vehicle and even more so that it will not be rebadged over to Chevy.  Having driven BMW 5 series, I'll take this car straight up.  At 25K less, its not even close..."
pontiac,g8,2009,S V, 09/10/2009,For the money it can't be beat,4,"Have had this car for 6 months and about 7000 miles.  It is an incredible value and I have no regrets on the purchase.  The car is refined yet powerful in a way that no other sedan in the 20's (real world price) can touch.  The torque is always available and free flowing and lets the car cruise at highway speeds effortlessly.  Mileage is acceptable on the freeway, quite bad (10 or so mpg) in stop and go.  The interior doesn't match the exterior style-wise and there are a few cheap plastic bits but I can live with it and the styling is nowhere near as tacky as some past Pontiacs.  Big flaw is passenger seat does not go back far enough for taller people.  Car was delivered with warped rotors."
pontiac,g8,2009,Tom, 09/21/2009,Awesome!,4,"I love this car!  I read all the great reviews on this web site before buying (Sport Red Metallic GT, V8) and the car has more than lived up to the rave reviews.  The power is fantastic.  Gas mileage is very good for a car with this power (averaging 19 to 20 mpg mixed highway/city).  Over 25 mpg on highway when I can control my right foot.  Acceleration off the line is amazing!  I test drove the V6 and V8.  Get the V8!  It does not cost that much more and the gas mileage is almost the same.  The extra power makes it that much more fun.  "
pontiac,g8,2009,phantom, 09/26/2009,A fine GT sedan,4,"Thi is one of the finest cars that I've ever owned: It is fast, well styled, handles well, and is quite comfortable. It is a shame that it wil soon no longer be available, since it is one of the very best four-door sedans ever offered by GM.  I also owned a 2004 Pontiac GTO, and the G8 is superior to it in every way -  faster, roomier, and better looking. The rear seating area is especially well done, with comfortable seats and plenty of head and legroom.  GM should not let this car get away. If you are considering the purchase of a high-performance GT, get one of these while you still can."
pontiac,g8,2009,yike''s, 09/24/2009,best car on the market.,5,"test drove G8 and test drove 2010 Camero enjoyed G8 more. great handling,very roomy, plenty of power for v6, got premium package, cant ask nothing more out of this car."
pontiac,g8,2009,pokerfred68, 10/13/2009,G8 GXP - The 4-door Corvette,4,"Best vehicle owned to date. Well beyond expectations. Bad idea for GM not to continue to offer this in the US. Want one bad enough...go to Australia. M5 killer for half the price. Also have a 2009 Vette with same engine...G8 can almost keep up! Only regret: no offer of an in-dash nav. This is one of the top 5 sport sedans in the world...bar none...regardless of price. At 415 hp, it's only $100 per pony. Glad to have one of the very few GXP's sold...hopefully a collector for the future."
pontiac,g8,2009,DallasTex, 10/15/2009,Amazing car at any price,4,"I purchased my 2009 Maverick Silver G8 GT in lieu of a BMW 550.  Not only was the G8 almost $50,000 less than the BMW, it actually performed better.  I am 6'4"" and weigh 330lbs.  I fit perfectly in the car.  On the road, I average 28mpg, and about 15mpg around town.  The car is very quick, and handles well.  It has been trouble free up to this point, and believe it or not, the car is quite exclusive.  I can go a month without ever seeing one on the road, and I live in N. Dallas.  Sadly, the G8 is no more, but the legend will live on.  I am very happy with my purchase."
pontiac,g8,2009,Spare Me, 10/24/2009,Really?,4,"Absolutely  LOVE this car. It is big, fast, comfortable, solid, safe, fast, and fast.  I went with White Hot with the red/onyx leather package. I can't decide if I like the inside or the outside more. We have our first baby on the way and I wanted a big 4 door sedan. Test drove a new Maxima and 300 C. Both nice cars, but the Maxi is front-wheel drive, and the 300 looks like a rental.  The G8 outperforms and is unique...especially since Pontiac is history.  Like so many other reviewers have said, get one while you still can.  The back seat is comfy and roomy enough for adults.  I can't wait to take this car a a nice long road trip. "
pontiac,g8,2009,xruling, 10/22/2009,YES!,4,"Any criticism of the car becomes the smallest ""administrivia"" when you push down the gas pedal.  Mine is very reliable, comfortable, devoid of irritating quirks or noises.  I'm thrilled with this car.  Wish I had another one ""in reserve."""
pontiac,g8,2009,Mid life crisis, 11/14/2009,Mid life crisis,4,Bought a 2009 g8 gxp. Live in Houston n couldnt find any where. Found on eBay. Hot white with red n black interior. 6 speed. Wife asked if was going through mid life crisis. Fast loud with Corsa exhaust n very fun to drive. I really like stereo n love 6 speed n 2nd or 3rd gear. Very big car. Handles like a go-cart. Love no one else has. I have seem one silver gt. That is it. Love car. Very fast. I always have people ask what car is. No one has yet to try n race me. They know.  
pontiac,g8,2009,Ringo1, 12/05/2009,last of the great ones,5,"I love the 2009 G8 GT that I recently purchased.  Hot White with Onyx/Red cloth interior.  One of the few early  GT's built with leather delete and Onyx/Red interior. I'm asked questions all the time about the car.  People cant believe that Pontiac was making such a great car, way under the radar. Try to find a four door sedan with a big V8, 6 speed auto trans. and RWD for under 35k. For those who complain about the overall fuel economy, remember that no one twisted your arm to buy a performance car. Can't have the ponies without having to feed them too.  The G8 GT's and GXP's are the final chapter in a long line of fine cars.  If Pontiac had to go, at least they went out with a bang!!"
pontiac,g8,2009,SV, 12/05/2009,Get it while you can,4,"With Pontiac going the way of Oldsmobile, I can't imagine too many people are willing to buy one of these anymore-to which all I can say is that is just too bad and pathetic mismanagement on GM's part.  This car is the best deal out there in my opinion and after 9 months and 7,000 miles I can say I really love this car.  This is a roomy, fast car that can quickly and comfortably eat up hundreds of miles at a stretch.  The seats are extremely comfortable and the ergonomics just fine.  It's not quite a luxury sedan but it's got all the essentials done well; nothing comes close to the roominess and performance for the real-world cost of this car.  Biggest glitch: came with defective rotors.   "
pontiac,g8,2009,spaycace, 12/24/2009,G8 GXP ROCKS!,4,"I drive my car 60 miles one way to work daily, and I'm glad I saved the 25 grand more that I would have spent on a CTS-V!  This car is a 4-door Corvette & is more than FUN to drive! I race/beat ""ponies"" and Camaros as well. Tried to get a vette to race me, but the driver simply wouldn't do it. With a few mods/tweaks, this car has more power & is faster than a base vette, and ANY mustang, even the over- priced supercharged one! I LOVE this car! The traction control works AMAZINGLY well considering the power.  MPG is acceptable, but then again, didn't buy it for economy.  The best mpg I've seen is 22.8, but the car isn't broken in with only 8500 miles.  BUY one if you can find one!"
pontiac,g8,2009,Joe D, 12/24/2009,"Awesome,practically gave it to me",4,"Just got mine!Rebate $6500,$500 dealer bonus,GMS discount,($2400)plus they put all season Eagle RSA 19"" on it and gave me the summer only tires.I felt like I stole it from them.Get yours NOW!They will all be gone FOREVER by the new year.Fast,fun,great looking,with excellent MPG if you stay off the pedal.Best deal ever offered by GM for a car that puts my Lincoln LS to shame.Premium stereo is great for me and traction control a big plus with rear wheel drive.Get ready to feel the G Force if you can snag one."
pontiac,g8,2009,Scott, 01/08/2010,"Not perfect, but glad I bought it",3,"Great handling, good ride, nice looking car, draws a lot of compliments.  Gas mileage averaging about 18 mpg in mostly city driving.  Nice steering feel, decent stereo.  Two problems so far at about 10,000 miles.  Bad gas cap, no big deal.  Developed a vibration in steering wheel at about 8000 miles.  Dealer said its the cylinder deactivation (active fuel mgmt) system transitioning from 4 to 8 cylinders and there is no fix for it yet.  Went to a tuner and he turned the thing off and retuned to run on super unleaded and reprogrammed transmission shift pts.  Car runs better than new and my mpg is about the same or even a little better.  That vibration was driving me crazy. "
pontiac,g8,2009,gfarrell, 01/12/2010,So far so good,3,"I really like this car.  It is fun to drive and I consider it a great value.  Not the nicest interior, and doesn't have all the gadgets, but enjoying the drive is the most important thing to me.  Every morning the commute to work is an adventure.  So far it has been very reliable, and the dealer was easy to work with.  I had a couple of issues that needed to be addressed the week after I got it, but they were fixed correctly and quickly.  I do not miss the drama of the BMW service department."
pontiac,g8,2009,mike, 01/19/2010,Not Perfect but Fun,4,"Fun car for relatively cheap money. about $28K for a $35k sticker car. Looks sporty yet classy. If you dont like compliments or random questions from strangers at gas stations about the car, dont buy one! To the person who complained about the OVERSPEED ""ding ding"" at 70mph, take 30 seconds to look in your owners manual and another 15 seconds to shut it off.  Its not hard! I hated the ""ding"" just from the ride home from the dealership and shut off the overspeed when I got home. Winter tire and wheel package are a MUST if youre in the snowbelt.  Drove the summer tires in a small storm while waiting for mail order snowtires. Yikes! All in all, quality is not BMW grade but the performance is."
pontiac,g8,2009,Kipper, 01/25/2010,Thanks Pontiac,4,"I researched cars for 2 years and got the GT. Better price/performance value than Audi, VW, BMW, Merc, Acura, etc. hands down. What you get for the price is unbeatable. This rides solid and quiet, punch it and fly. Styling is awesome. Driving position is great, it drives like a small car. It isnt perfect but I'll take it. My dream car that I can actually afford. I'm taking it to the track soon. City mileage 18. Highway mileage 27. Be careful with curbs. "
pontiac,g8,2009,dvick, 02/01/2010,Should have bought 2 of them!,4,"Purchased my G8-GT before I knew Pontiac was going down the tubes. Did my research. This car has more interior room than a BMW 7 Series, four 6 ft+ people can go cross country, no problem. V8 got me 24.5 mpgs fully loaded going thru desert with a/c full blast! I will keep this car until it craters on me. People still stop me occasionally to compliment the car. After 18k miles, absolutely no squeaks, no rattles, a pet peeve of mine. Performance claims are correct- 0-60 in 5.3, 13.5 1/4 mile at 110 mph- AWESOME for a car that'll haul the family in complete comfort. IF you can find one, BUY IT, but plan on keeping it- but don't worry, you WILL, as it puts a BMW 550i to shame for half the price"
pontiac,g8,2009,Larry, 01/29/2010,Adapting quite well,4,"Still like this car alot.After 17 months of ownership nothing to complain about.I still feel the price was more than fair,& Purchased An oem 19"" rim & tire at dealer cost(maybe)as a spare.Overall mileage has been 19 to 20 mpg mixed driving,on a 150 mile trip yesterday 23.5 mpg. Biggest problem is watching speed limits, I am old & try to obey the law. Overall I have very pleased with the comfort & performance & especially the reliability so far. Motortrend is saying gm is now inclined to bring the g8 back as a high line chevy limited production. Because of new cafe standards. "
pontiac,g8,2009,Curtis, 04/13/2010,Great & Fast,5,I bought mine used with 2750 miles on it from a Pontiac dealer.  It was traded in on a new Z-28.  Is in perfect shape. It is Black Metallic and has custom chrome wheels that sets it off.  Best fuel mpg is 27 and has averaged 24-26 running at 72 mph on average.
pontiac,g8,2009,Herk Loadmaster, 04/22/2010,"If you can find one, buy it!",4,I purchased this vehicle in December 2009 after my 2008 Lancer got totalled in an accident. I could only find about 10 in my area when I was looking. FANTASTIC car for the price! I can't believe how fast it is. I have the gas pedal on the floor at every on ramp I encounter. I had the dealer install 17 inch winter wheel and tire package before delivery because I live in the northern US. I have no problems getting around during the cold winter months. This a drivers car for sure.
pontiac,g8,2009,amgendude, 05/05/2010,Ginger,4,"Bought the car for $26K right after Xmas when GM was giving $6500 rebate and took advantage of dad's discount. Car is an incredible value. Defy anyone to find comparable value. Total shame that Pontiac is gone. Now own two discontinued cars (2002 S2000). Not enamored by the interior, radio has some odd controls, no power seat back adjustment or garage door controls either. Minor complaints. Car accelerates great but agree that the tranny could be smoother. Driving on the turnpike, it's not surprising to look down to see I'm going 90 and not realizing it. Love the styling and love the attention it gets since you hardly see this car in south Florida. A real gem. Would buy again in a minute."
pontiac,g8,2009,Larry, 09/07/2010,Just gets better with time,4,"Averaging about 20 mpg with mixed everyday driving.GM has provided one year of free oil changes & tire rotations for having closed the Pontiac division.Gm also offered cash incentives for Pontiac owners.I have not seen anything I would trade for. At 4k needed a wheel alignment, to correct odd tire wear.Tire wear has been very good ever since,in fact the car has been trouble free so far.Very acceptable interior room, I find the comfort level terrific, & I am very sensitive to leg room & seat comfort. Still love the performance when needed, which honestly is not very often. Just a pleasure to get in & drive,would love to be getting 30 mpg, but don't put on enough miles to economically matter."
pontiac,g8,2009,Krisi C, 09/23/2010,G8,4,My parents got me a G8 for my 16th birthday going on 2 years ago. My parents love it because of all the safety features but I love the way it looks. We have not had any trouble with it at all. I am very happy they chose this car!

pontiac,g8,2009,Clinton, 09/20/2019,Tight and Precise,4,"Moved from 1996 Impala SS to Pontiac G8 GT.  Love the handling, acceleration, highway mileage, trunk space.  Find the ""A"" pillar a bit distracting since it contains airbags.  Car is a great highway driver but the instrument cluster reflects glare.  This deficiency disappears at night and it is easy to see all information.  Two irritations (1) seat back tilt is by a hard-to-reach wheel on the outside of the back. (2) The entire interior is black so it is difficult to find a dropped object; day or night!

pontiac,g8,2009,Janet in Louisiana, 02/17/2020,I LOVE THIS SLEEPER!!,5,"I have had my car for 9 years.Like others mention you have confidence to pass when needed it will not let you down.Shortly after purchase,by Christmas my husband got me an escort detector.Like soup and sandwiches,you can not have one without the other!!! Even though you do no mean to you will be speeding before you know it.It is a shame, I hear today they are shutting down Holden plants.At one time we all had g8s.Me and my two sons.One silver,one blue and my dark grey or charcoal I guess.I do get looks for the car, but also because I am a 63 year old lady.It surely is a pleasure to drive.

pontiac,g8,2009,Best Worst Vehicle Ever, 06/16/2020,Base V6 Shouldn't Exist at All,4,"Let me preface this by stating the obvious - if you're going to purchase a G8 these days, there is no excuse to ignore the GT or GXP in lieu of the Base V6. However, when I purchased a gleaming bright red Base V6 in 2013 with 25k miles for $17,500 - the intention was to swap an LS Motor/Trans one day. Although the V6 was sufficient enough in limited situations like overtaking a slow driver or racing a Chevy Cruze from a stoplight, it was an insult to the GT, GXP, and anyone who was duped into settling for mediocrity. Pontiac missed the mark here -- the G8 should've retained 3 trim levels, but all should have NA V8 paired with a Manual Trans. The exterior design that blends Pontiac with Holden was absolutely stunning, and a long wheelbase on such a mammoth vehicle really set the G8 apart from anything else on the road at the time. My bright red base G8 with window tint garnered more attention than any project car or objectively nicer car I've owned, combined. No vehicle caught the attention of police up and down the east coast so easily, either - the V8 would've been helpful a few times.

Now to the rest of the car. The true draw to G8's are exterior design and powerful engines, and whilst the interior layout wasn't the ugliest Pontiac has ever come up with, there's no doubt Pontiac was fully responsible for the excessive use of cheap plastics, faux leather seats, infotainment interface from 1992, and assembled with the grace of 8 toddlers. Nothing was flush, everything looked slapped together, plastics were poorly disguised with patterns resembled the quality of a solo cup, and the front seats were never uniform in build quality (even in the same G8). 

So if the interior is on par with early 90's Daewoo quality, the more common Base V6 model makes owners feel like American Muscle imposters better suited for a Bonneville, and both V8 models are still pushing $30-$40k in 2020 -- what's the point?? Nobody buys the G8 GT or GXP for any other reason aside from --> Massive & Muscular Car + 6.0L+ V8 Power = THE POINT. Between 2008-2009 absolutely nothing stateside was comparable to the G8. Even a decade later they're impossible to miss rumbling down the road or requiring 1.5 parking spots in the back of a Whole Foods parking lot. Even though I didn't have the pleasure of purchasing and caring for a true Pontiac G8, my bright red base model brought a smile to my face every single day.

pontiac,grand-am,2000,teravain, 08/18/2011,2000 SE (Automatic Transmission option),3,"Over all the 2000 Grand Am has been an excellent car. Mine has over 200k miles on it with 185k of them put on by me. 

The car lasted up until about 189k then one of the cylinders dropped to 60% pressure and I can't use the AC when I am stopped at a stop sign or the engine will stall. 

Paint started peeling at the bottom of the front doors after 8 years of driving on a dirt road at 45 miles per hour for 2 miles per day.

The front dash has started to lift a little from the sun light hitting it the last 11 years, and driver side window button is finally starting to act up.

At 13k this car has lived up to all my expectations."
pontiac,grand-am,2000,richie_east, 12/15/2011,Amazing car for being almost 12,4,"I purchased my car two years ago with 99,000 miles and it now has 142,000. I have had very minimal repairs. Great car, paint still looks great with the exception of minor paint chips in the hood and bumper. I love the fact this car gives me all the power and response i need. Ive driven friends new Mercedes c230 thats feels gutless and slow to respond compared to my Grand am. I plan on driving the wheels off this car. After being 11 years old, i still catch myself looking at it and admiring the beauty of it. I see lots of grand am gt's on the road and not to sound superficial, but mine is one of the best looking ones on the road. Overall i love this car and get compliments on it all the time!"
pontiac,grand-am,2000,Jamie, 12/26/2009,Pretty decent car,4,"I received this car in mid-2006 and have had it ever since. It just hit 200,000 miles and has still kept going (knock on wood!) I am pleased with the way it has held up. I drive an average of 25,000 miles each year so I am pretty hard on cars."
pontiac,grand-am,2000,sholomar, 04/30/2011,Not bad at all after all these years,4,"All in all I haven't had to spend much at all on maintenance over the years.. the biggest expense was the intake manifold but that didn't need to be done, just a slow external leak that doesn't harm anything.. dealer sensationalism and gouging.. lesson learned.

The blinker contacts are dirty making it blink a lot, the power window just went, the fan doesn't work above 3, the radios display is dead, the power lock on the passenger side is dead.. little electronic things are starting to happen over time that I could fix myself pretty cheap and just might.. but overall I can't complain for having a car last 10 years.

Starts first time, every time.. even at 30 below zero. Well built powertrain"
pontiac,grand-am,2000,ChrisJ, 09/03/2003,Great looks! Great quality! Great car!,4,"Once I drove this car, I loved 
it. It was in mint condition. Under the 
car, the engine, and around the doors 
all rust free! And no the car was not 
painted. The interior was the same with 
no cheep plastics that break. It has 
the 3.4L V6 which has great 
proformance. It has excellent 
acceleration. The comfort is 
excellent:lots of leg room in the front 
and back. The sporty design, and my 
favourite (red dash lights) make this 
car look awesome. As for build quality 
and reliability , I've had no problems. 
It has great handling and a smooth 
ride. Its solid and doesnt have road 
noises. This is a great car and I would 
recommend it."
pontiac,grand-am,2000,am_can_drift, 04/21/2015,Pretty Little Liar,3,"From the outside, this car looks amazing. It looks good on the inside and under the hood, too. But...this car was a repair boat for me and everyone I know who drove one. Granted, mine had 130k when I got it. In two months, I had repaired the fuel pump, head gasket, and transmission. 
My aunt owned this, and also repaired a good deal on it, and she bought hers new. (water pump, transmission, radiator).
All in all this car did not live up to expectations at all. It falls into a class of ""cheap sports cars"", but also the ""lemon category"". "

I Love getting into this car every time. The color (navy blue), the style.
There are just too many things that are falling off - both side mirrors, the overhead light, no visible clock, back window goes half-way up/down depending on mood. It's a good thing I own this car, because I wouldn't be able to afford the repairs every 3-4 months if I had to make car payments.
Giving up my Grand Am will be like losing my best friend - albeit a high-maintenance friend.
If I could find a way to replace all these problems to make it run for another 10 years, I would in half-a-heartbeat."
pontiac,grand-am,2000,GM JUNK, 12/25/2005,GM denotes General Maintainence,2,"What a horrible vehicle. From the day i bought it, it was in the shop for an intake gasket then, a fuel pump, brakes, constant emissions problems, power seat, a/c, cracked exhaust manifold and the problems continue. No wonder imports retain value. With the quality of gm cars, there is no competition for imports. Keep-up the ""great"" work GM.      "
pontiac,grand-am,2000,MW, 08/01/2008,A beautiful disaster,3,"I fell in love with the Grand Am when my grandmother owned one, and let my family use it at the time our old Plymouth broke down.  I threw the car up on a pedestal and practically worshiped the idea.  Today, I'm here to tear that idea down.  Since buying the car LESS than a year ago when it only had 50,000 miles on it, it has given me nothing but hell.  The brakes are poor, three power windows broke down, the head gasket went ($850), tie rod good-bye, CD player Error 20-ed out... and the PassLock system believes I'm the enemy!  Granted, the car is fun to drive and looks sleek, but the amount of money invested is NOT worth the pain unless $3000 is in your budget in a six month span."

I have to say I am very pleased, aside from the cheap plastic clips used to hold the windows to the track that continue to break (JB Weld makes a good permanent fix) this car has been nothing but great.  It has survived a year of my ""all or nothing"" ""hey wanna race"" driving without a sputter.  I drive a lot and i drive hard and the Grand Am continues to deliver.  It has the styling and performance I want in a car and the comfort and economy me wife wants.  I never wanted to own a Grand am before this one.  Now we plan to sell our Grand Prix and get another Grand Am GT preferably the SCT."
pontiac,grand-am,2000,Simply FAB, 11/28/2008,Stay far away from GM cars!,3,I have had this car for 4 years and I had fixed the intake gasket 3 times. I have to do brakes like twice a year.

It's fairly comfortable, quick enough for daily driving and fun to drive. Reliability is... okay. It's had intake gaskets, power steering pump, fuel pump, water pump, power seat motors, front power windows replaced twice each, rear power windows replaced and a new BCM computer. It looks like junk with peeling clearcoat and disintegrating dashboard, but it starts first try and gets me to my destination with no fuss. Gas mileage averages mid-20's, but that's mostly my fault as I like making the V6 work hard."

had 4 (yes 4) rack and pinions. It has 
had all 4 window motors replaced 2 
times each and now another one is 
broken.  All totalled, my warranty 
company has paid almost $10,000 in 
repair bills in 4 years!  Not to 
mention a new transmission, 3 fuel 
pumps, rotors (recalled). The trim 
around the windshield keeps coming 
off.  The paint has had to be done on 
the trunk and wing.  What a piece of 
crap - I don't think I could even give 
it away at this point -  nobody would 
want it."
pontiac,grand-am,2000,rswilson01, 05/22/2003,1fun1,5,"Great Car! Had to replace a bigun' that 
was stolen and tried a few. My wife 
loved it. I wasn't sure even after 
buying it(if Momma ain't happy, ain't 
nobody happy!). 3 yrs later I'm glad 
her emotion overruled me. It's a 
fantastic car. It's a lively, road 
warrior that's a joy to drive; always 
responsive no matter what. Almost beach 
season and the family's eager to use 
the moonroof and stereo every Saturday. 
The car's big enough but not too big; 
cute enough for her; exciting enough 
for me. My 12yo son is already asking 
if he's going to ""inherit"" the car when

let him have all the fun!"

I bought the car in Summer 2010, it is now spring 2013, the car has 178,478 miles on it! Still kick ass. I've only had to replace a water pump (15 Dollars Brand New, Advanced Auto Parts), a starter (50 Dollars Brand new Ebay), & When I bought it the driver side window never worked. 70 dollars and an ebay search got me all new parts for both driver and passenger windows. Both work flawlessly now! also got two brand new headlights for 60 bucks, wasn't needed but wanted. LOVE THIS CAR! Still driving this car!"
pontiac,grand-am,2000,Knox, 08/15/2018,Grand damn am,4,"Well this car can be a hand full. Things to watch out for. First off that oil pressure sensor at the top of the spark plug valley. It will seem like the valve cover leaks but more likely the switch. It leaks from inside of it. The housing for the spark plug they like to crack. Sometimes it's not even visible. Water pump just watch that mother. This car is definitely for mechanical inclined. I'd use 5w20 since it has small oil wells. Deff do ur oil changes every 3000 to 5000 miles at most. Other than that has okise mpg and power  they ride well and shift good. They can be very reliable or leave you on the side of the road if neglected.

Thank god i got a 2 year warranty on this thing. Hopefully i won't need to get it fixed as often as you guys have.  I love the car. But i guess i'll update this thing in about 2 years.  From the 94 nightmare ($500 every 2 months) saturn sl2 i had. This is a big improvement...Trust me!"

Six months into having the vehicle I needed to replace my power steering pump. I just replaced a fuel pump and a day later needed a new intake manifold gasket because my antifreeze was leaking (about a gallon or two a day). The fuel pump caused a lot of problems because my car continued to break down yet mechanics found nothing wrong several times.

Its an electrical nightmare and found out recently the 1998-2000 models have been known to catch fire without even being started (DO NOT PARK NEAR HOUSE) The cheap plastic control knobs break easy in cold weather. The CD players are famous for flashing ""error messages"" and quit working around 120,000 miles. Blown head gaskets are very common around 90- 100,000 miles. So yes, it looks good, drives tight but I wouldn't buy another!!"
pontiac,grand-am,2000,wild_166, 05/03/2010,Great Car!!,4,"I got my car with 49,000 miles in 2003. It has been a great car. Yes I have had to do normal maintenance and a few extra but other then that It has done broke down on me. It now has 237,000 + miles on it and the fuel pump has finally died. Everyone about dies when I tell them it's never been replace before now. The gas mileage is also great . The only downside is that brakes and rotors don't last long with the mileage I drive every year. Also If you buy one look under the spare trunk lid and see if it says NC1. I live in Indiana and my car has never been in CA and that is where it was built for so if you ever need to replace heads , and other parts you cannot buy them in other places in us."
pontiac,grand-am,2000,Grego, 05/29/2010,Great for 11 years old!,4,"I bought this car, upgrading from a 94 Taurus, from a co-worker. This car is in great condition thanks to the previous owner. Maintenance goes a long way when done properly and on time. Braking seems soft, even with new brake pads installed. Very fun and sporty, and so far I get about 29-31 MPG highway. Great handling on winding roads, even with sub-par tires. Tires for the GT can be a little pricier and is hard to find good all seasons that don't change tire size, which means recalibrating the speedometer. Overall I am very happy, and make sure you do your upkeep! Acceleration can seem sluggish at times, and @ 110K mi. time for new belts, hoses, and a good tune-up."

pontiac,grand-am,2000,Eric, 06/25/2010,Pretty and Expensive,4,"Bought the car with 55k on it. It did all normal maintenance on the car. I had to change brakes every year, rotors about every 18 months. The clips in the drivers side window broke several times, leaving me without a window to use. At 90k the car just fell apart. First the wheel bearings and rack and pinion needed changed. Then the power steering pump went. Not two weeks later, i had to have the intake manifold gaskets replaced. After that the fuel pump went out on me. Not reliable at all. But fun to drive."
pontiac,grand-am,2000,Terri, 08/26/2010,Some Like it Hot,4,"When I purchased this car,it had 165k miles. My Volvo's pmts were $400.00 a month, and repairs on the Volvo were never less than $1000-$2000., just to keep it on the road! For the last three years. I was never told EXACTLY what was wrong, but they definitely wanted their money! Since the Pontiac purchase, I have replaced the ignition switch,$400.00, and now know that the intake manifold gasket will need to be replaced- the a/c needs to be fixed, and the passenger side windows no longer roll down- must fix soon. Live in MS! All this is STILL less than I have put into my USED Volvo over a one year period. I think that I will live with the Pontiac- did I mention that I purchased for $1000.00? "

I sent it to mechanick and he said it was factory defect. He showed to me that old transmission and I could see that it cracked exacly in the middle all round the transmission. OK I asked him to change and get another one with 80,000 on it. Which hi did. I was driving it for a year. Big oil consumption. In 3000 miles i had to add 2.5 quars of oil. When it was 130,000 My motor broke down in the middle of the higway.  I barely got to my brother's house. And I am not fixing it.  What, Do i have to change motor and transmission every 130,000 Miles? "
pontiac,grand-am,2000,Mary, 10/07/2010,2000 Grand Am,4,"Good buy for the money, but now becoming an expense.

Repair estimates came in starting at $800 so I drove around with no air in Atlanta's worst heat in history! The one honest mechanic left in the whole world (Poston Motors, Cumming, GA) bypassed a switch and voila - air! And an oil change: Less than $100.00!  Now, dashboard coming apart, both outside mirrors bout to fall off, automatic door buttons & mirror adjustment have fallen through the door panel & yesterday, interior rear view fell off!

years.  The doors are not lined up and 
paint has chipped on the doors because 
of it (in the first 10000 miles).  
Dealers won't help at all, even the 
place I bought it.  Car was in the shop 
3 times for the check engine light.  I 
finally figured out ON MY OWN that the 
gas cap wasen't tight enough.  (smart 
mechanics)  Now, it won't start and has 
been in twice for this problem in 2 
weeks. My entended warrenty didn't even 
cover half!  It was fixed without me 
ever okaying the extra cost.  I fought 
it and lost.  I am so fed up with 
Pontiac not standing behind their 
product!  Never again."
pontiac,grand-am,2000,Tinnelle, 08/01/2002,"Great car, even for families!",5,"This was definitely the car of my

vehicle -- the car has been hit four 
times in the past two years that I've 
owned it, however, it's come out in the 
end looking like a charm and still 
functioning perfectly -- and occupants 
sustained only minor injuries.  This is 
remarkable considering that the first 
accident involved a Ford Explorer 
hitting the passenger-side between the 
two doors with their front right 
fender.  $13,000 worth of damage, but 
easily repaired, and again very little 
injury to the occupants.  Gas mileage 
is great -- lots of room for lots of 
people and furry friends (we have two 
dogs)."

pontiac,grand-am,2000,kenscott, 11/26/2002,Going back to Ford,3,"I bought this car about 5 months ago. 
It ran much better than I anticipated; 
for a 4-cylinder that is. Gas mileage 
averages about 23-25 mpg. I know I can 
be a lead foot, but my 6-cylinder 
Taurus did the same mpg. Recently, I 
had to replace the catalytic converter-
CC(covered under warranty) The 
mechanic noticed a bad transmission 
leak. He thinks that some of the 
knocking that I attributed to the CC 
was actually the torque converter in 
the transmission. I await the bad news.
Also there is a groan at times when 
turning the steering wheel severely at 
low speeds."

took this car to bring me back singing 
its praises.  It is both beautiful and 
quick and 30+ MPG is easy to take too.
Had a hard time deciding between the 
Grand Prix and AM and am happy with the 
choice, because it handles lighter and 
quicker.  GP is softer but still a 
great car also.  Thanks Pontiac."

could be better.  Our company has 
leased many of these cars and we have 
had numerous electrical and brake

Saturn, Honda, or Nissan instead (If I 
had to buy one)."
pontiac,grand-am,2000,WhyMe, 01/03/2003,Falling apart,1,"I bought the car brand new and three 
years later I can't wait to get rid of 
it.  The fuel pump went out at 26000 
miles.  Seals around passenger windows 
leaked so flooded my interior at 
29000.  The front bearings had to be 
repacked at 32000.  Windshield plastic 
moldings flew off while driving down 
the road.  Window falls in door and 
costs $600 to fix!!  Rearview mirror 
falls off repeatedly despite getting 
fixed everytime.  The list continues, I 
will NEVER buy another Pontiac . . .or 
Domestic for that matter."
pontiac,grand-am,2000,Kimmyc, 07/03/2003,"Nice looking, but........",3,"It looks great. Have owned it for 2yrs

are problems.  As soon as the 36,000 mi 
warranty was up, there was  a crack in 
the fly wheel - VERY expensive. Thsnks 
to the dealership, they covered it.  
There have been electrical problems.  , 
the blower motor went on speed 1 & 2 -t 
$100 to fix. The drivers side window 
would not go up or down - $300 to fix.  
There are other signs that there are 
pending electrical problems.  Now the 
car wont pass inspection because of a 
bad wheel bearing, NO MORE -  so 
needless to say, I am trading it before 
it kills me financially.  "

electrical problems.  Many times the 
dealerships were very difficult to work 
with and wouldn't fix it on the first

little rattle on the right side I need 
checked and the fuel pump went early on

years. I bought mine brand new with 159

to have problems. It all started with 
the intake gaskets, then the #6 fuel 
injector, then the radiator flow being 
blocked and the thermostat sticking at 
37000. Right after the warranty??? I 
have spent $1000 in the last month on 
repairs to include the drivers door 
window, but that was repaired for free. 
Thank god for GM Goodwrench Service

at that. I agree with WhyMe. Great car,

times in 1 1/2 years because of brake

rolls up the whole way.  People have 
made comments that it doesn't sound

pontiac,grand-am,2000,matt, 10/30/2005,matt's review,4,"For being an SE, not the sportier GT, it handles quite nicely, and has a smooth ride too. The v6 makes enough power to smoke the tires if you're interested to know.  Mine happens to have 130,000 miles on it and I get throttle happy with it sometimes anyway.  It makes Tauruses look lethargic, and Honda Civic, hah, is that a sedated hamster under the hood of those things? In all seriousness, for being rated at a rather low 170HP, the 207c.i. v6 has more than enough torque to compensate. There's also performance parts if stock just isn't good enough. If you think American cars are crap, you're wrong.  I've had no problems since I've had it.  Pros- it's quick, girls like it Cons- still FWD"

knows this car is crap and will settle 
suits.  Within 20K miles this was 
replaced:  tires, full brakes, intake 
manifold gasket, all fuel injectors, 
fuel pump, fuel sensor, turn switch, 
window regulator, power steering pump, 
and belt.  It might be fun to drive but 
it will be in the shop all the time 
and thats no fun.  I have heard that 
the newer models are even worse.  GM

relationship. I love the layout of it, 
the features, and the speed, but I hate 
the gas mileage you get on it, and also 
the shortness of brake life. I have 
heard that you get better gas mileage 
if you use synthetic oil. Gas mileage 
is fine as long as you don't hotrod it 
like I do. "
pontiac,grand-am,2000,Bart2, 07/28/2004,HORRIBLE CAR!!!!,2,"This car has cost me thousands of 
dollars in repairs, not to mention the 
repairs that had to be done while still 
under warranty.  Repairs include:  4 
brake jobs, intake gasket crack, front 
wheel hub bearing replace, fuel 
pump went out, power steering went 
out, etc. etc.  I am trading it in and 
cutting my losses!  Don't buy this

a fun to drive vehicle, handles well, 
has an excellent radio, gets good gas 
mileage and looks great on the road.  
I've been very pleased with the

pontiac,grand-am,2000,cojoe735, 03/11/2003,I expected more as a repeat Pontiac cust,4," Overall, I have had a few nusiance 
problems with the car that I should not 
have had a problem with being a new 
car. I have had trouble with a side 
view mirror breaking during an 
automatic car wash, lost power steering 
due to a failed hose connection, 
drivers side window retaining clips 
failed, cigarette/accesory plug in 
keeps popping fuses, moisture in the 
taillights causing the turn signals to 
fail, abs never worked correctly, brake 
replacement @ 10,000 miles.  Overall, 
It's a great looking car with alot of 
power for its class.  The great looking 
style and power almost makes it 
bearable to put up with the mechanical 
short-commings of this vehicle."

it.  I have had not one problem what-so-
ever. I have yet to replace brakes 
(need to in about 3,000 miles), tires, 
or any other part.  The car works 
great, sometimes it has some trouble 
turing over, but it has always started 
for me. I have babied the car, changing 
the oil every 3,000 miles and being 
easy on the brakes and accelerator most 
of the time.  It is unrealistic for you 
to beat on a car and expect it to run 
well, if your hard on the brakes expect 
to change them alot, if you hot rod the 
car around expect to get bad gas 
milage.  The car definitly has kick to 
it, and is equiped with a very good 
sound system."

this!?!  Loved the looks, paid for 
them in quality.  Once I put CERAMIC 
pads on all 4, aftermarket rotors and 
calipers on, brakes lasted a little 
longer.  Wheel bearings junk.  Drive 
train great, everything else is 
ensuring AC Delco workers their 
retirement pay and keeping the

Changed oil regularly and had very few problems. Love the exterior design. My first Grand Am had 4 doors and this one has 2. Now I know I prefer 4 because it's difficult getting into and out of the back seat. Value is now less than half what I am paying for it. I think I owe more on the loan that it is now worth  because of this, I may never by new again.  I would think about upgrading to a Grand Prix next time for more interior comfort."

pontiac,grand-am,2000,Kriss, 11/28/2006,Grand AM,3,"I have had my Grand AM for 2 years now and it's been a horrible experience.  They are made very poorly, and nothing is easy to get to when trying to fix it.  It has broken down 4 times already and nothing has been cheap to fix.  It still runs and I am still driving it but I hate it.  It is a very unreliable car and I'm hoping to sell it or trade it off as soon as possible because I have a baby on the way and I don't want to be driving a unreliable car when I have a newborn."

I was able to get out of my pontiac with just a seat belt burn and a broken nail. I had no hospital bill as I am completely fine. I spun around in the ditch and came back on the road. This car is very safe and reliable car. My pontiac is destroyed and looks like those horrible accidents you see on the news where people were killed.

My biggest peeve is the bad gas mileage. You can hear your money thrown away in the guzzle sound the motor makes. The window motors are crap. They make weird noises and seem like they will break, already replaced one. The interior is just plain ugly. Sound system is great though. Single CD with equalizer. Amazing bass as stock. And I can't go anywhere without the front end bottoming out. Steep driveways, curbs, you name it. But the car gets me where I need to go. Just not very high quality of a car.

It wasn't cheap but I knew this going in, and got a good deal because of this.  Other than that I have had no serious problems.  Just a little problem with the hazard switch that ended up being recalled by GM and fixed for free anyways.  Someone busted my passenger side mirror, but it was surprisingly cheap and easy to fix myself.  I have been happy with this car.  "

I drive 80 miles a day and it gets me from here to there, but I am constantly having to have my rotors turned.  The car also shakes a lot and I have had it looked at several times and they can't find anything wrong. The computer is always saying something is wrong.  The throttle also sticks and it will speed up on its own.  Now don't get me wrong I love how the car looks but when it comes down to it I would want something more reliable."

This car handles real well and is fun to drive. Every once and a while the windows stop working, but a well placed hit can get them working, mind this cars mileage, and it gets 25 miles per gallon, so okay. The electronics are starting to go, but it is 8 years old, so not a problem. I would recommend this car to anyone and would probably buy another. The stereo system is amazing as well."
pontiac,grand-am,2000,Demetrius Hartman, 12/05/2016,Great car for work!,4,"Before you buy this car, there are a couple key points to know first; Year, oil change rate, and suspention. If the year of the vehicle is 1995 or lower then it's not worth investing your time into. Second, the oil should always be changed EVERY 1500 miles. If it's a 3.4 L, then the engine will obviously burn more ( but not a large amount) fuel and oil on cold starts. Third, if your inspecting a Grand Am to purchase and you can easily make a corner of the vehicle bounce up and down without a lot of strength (or with one arm), then the suspension is bad, and isint worth getting. Those are some things to look out for.

pontiac,grand-am,2001,Reinaldo, 07/16/2015,My very fist car (Grand Am Se 2001 4 sp auto),5,"I bought this car used in January 2012 for $ 950 and 176660 miles. It was what I could afford. The turn signal switch worked when it wanted to,  so I went to Freight Harbor Tools and purchased my fist tool box and fixed it. The AC started working after the Ac relay was replaced under hood and has never quit working. As a maintenance tip, I run the AC for several minutes in winter time for proper system lubrication. Replaced tranny fluid at 182 K. Right after that I made a trip from Phoenix to Kansas City and back (2460 miles) and got 32 mpg. I replaced the factory fuel pump at 210 K ( $ 58 on Ebay). After several ten minutes waiting for passlock system restart, finally I bypassed it with a resistor (you can look it up online). Breaks were replaced with ceramic pads (do not used semi-metallic ones ) and it´s been two years now and no problems. I went ahead and replaced timing chain, water pump and thermostat as a preventive maintenance last year at 218 K, but I was not having any problems with them. Never had random lights on dash but whenever I see Service Vehicle Soon, it means there is a blown bulb or fuse. My only complaint: rough idle but with almost 223 k miles I guess it has given me a lot for the money.
Update:  I gathered the resources and replaced all the mounts, even the ones that look ""good"" : end of the rough idle. Before that , I replaced the front wheel hub and that eliminated the ABS light and the wobbling. The a/c quit working. Before you do anything crazy, go ahead and check the pressure switch in the line on top of the radiator. It was that simple. My friends who have newer cars say mine cools the interior faster than theirs and it is true. At 246k I had the tranny rebuilt (it was the original one) because it was slipping between 3rd and 4th gear, but drivable. Now it is almost 255k miles 6 month later. The enigne is still good. I put synthetic oil to cope with the Phoenix heat. No favorite brand: I just go to 99c stores and pick whatever synthetic at $2.99, not bad. I don't drive like I stole it, specially when first start it. I guess all of this makes possible to keep the car.
Update: Justo hit 281000 Miles on the dame engine. Not Bad at all. Still powerful when needed and good on gas at the dame time. Un fact some people have tried to race me. I installed an aftermarket Muffler back in 2014, that is not loud and gives the car some attitude. The xenon lights that I installed back in 2013 are still working ( I could not take yellow bulbs any longer in the headlights) This car is good if You are mechanic inclined, specially if bought with many miles on ir. 8 years later, no car payment and 114000 added miles, so no regrets.

pontiac,grand-am,2001,eddy37, 02/07/2014,13 years and counting,4,"Bought mine new in 2001. I've taken decent care of it, oil changes, minor repairs. It's never broken down or had any major issues. Has the same issues as other Grand AM's. Side passenger mirror just fell off, AC has been broken for a couple years, fan speeds 1 and 2 don't work, side mirror control broken. The car itself is no longer waterproof. The factory battery lasted 11 years. Took it on a road trip this summer and actually got really good mileage. To recap, it's been paid for since 2005 and has never left me stranded. ***Update*** After a year of taking up space on my driveway I decided it was time to part with the old girl. My only regret is not getting the windshield replaced which would have addressed the water issues. The car still fired up on the day kidney car drove it into the flat bed for recycling in 2017. This is not a story of a car that wore out; but a story of an owner who neglected a masterpiece. I'm left now with a donation receipt for $25 and 16 years of memories. Fairwell Grand AM.

pontiac,grand-am,2001,Linda, 09/24/2015,Would Buy Again if they still made Pontiac,5,"I bought this car New in 2001. It's an SE not a GT but there wasn't a choice for a 2 door SE, 6 cyl 3.4. It is now 2015 have 123k miles. Two repairs while under warranty, one was an oil leak and one was the ignition switch. Very little maintenance over the years other than oil changes and brakes. Did not do any of the other recommended maintenance. Replaced the alternator, tie rods and a sensor. Replaced the original battery at year 8 and still driving on the second. Starts right up with no hesitation. Still has speed and handles well. I am getting 26 miles/city more than when it was new. Biggest annoyance is the power Windows. Both had to be replaced and you have to replace the whole thing window and all. Over $300 per window even though the glass was still good as well as the motor, just the clips broke. Less than $2000 in repairs over 15 years. Not bad at all. Best car I ever had. Biggest complaint would be the rust (seems like all of them rust in the same place between the doors and the back tires). Started about year 7 and is pretty bad now. I do have to say I live in Chicago and the car has been outside it's whole life and I did not rust proof or undercoat and I probably haven't washed it in the last five years. Other than that area the paint and body has held up good. Time for a new car as I know I have some major suspension work that needs to be done. I'm hearing some mighty loud and strange noises when going over bumps in the last year. The service engine light goes on and off and the air conditioner blows hot this year. Leary to put any major money in a 15 year old car. All in all considering the original cost of the car, loan interest , repairs and maintenance it's has been an average of somewhere between $1600 & 2000 per year for this car, so tops $166 a month (not counting gas of course) to run this car. In all that time it only didn't start once (ignition switch) I was driving when the alternator went out so with some fancy driving I was able to drive home the 5 miles. The battery I replaced before it totally died but was taking a couple tries to start so I had some warning and after all it was 8 years old. As a woman it's reassuring to have a reliable car. It actually makes me sad to get rid of it. This was my first new car purchase on my own about a year after my divorce. It's almost like one of my kids, no wait way more reliable this both my kids combined.

pontiac,grand-am,2001,Chris, 08/12/2006,5 Years Strong,4,"I have run this car in all conditions (snow, sleet, high heat, many rough dirt roads, hard driving, easy driving) and it's responded to the challenge.  The 3400 V6 is more than adequate for a car of this size and weight and it and the tranny are such that you get nice punch and grip as you take off.  I have 120K, but can go to 200K easy IMO. Normal problems did originally get to me also (lower intake manifold gasket (1x @ $150), tire grinding noise (all 4 tires w/ Warranty), blower resistor (1x @ $20), left and right wheel hub assembly (1x each @ $130 each), IAT wiring wiring issue causing hard shift into drive and park (1x @ $90) and EGR valve (1x @ $90).

I have also come to believe that if you take good care of it, it will repay you. Got it from my mom in 2006 with 25k on it. It had been parked in her driveway collecting waterstains and mice. Initially I named it the lemon (I never liked it, but my husband did) after getting new tires, new fluids, getting rid of rabbits chewing wires and some other normal things, I made a deal with it. It takes care of me and I take care of it. Yes, they have quirks, but if you take really good care of it, it will run like a champ. It thinks it's a sports car. I drive it at least 51 miles everyday.

pontiac,grand-am,2001,Stephanie, 01/21/2009,One Headache After Another,3,"I've had more problems with this car. It is infamous for having coolant problems and can only be fixed by replacing lower intake manifold (not cheap, have to take apart entire engine) which I experienced, constantly leaked coolant and it you didn't add it would overhead in a 5 min trip, and on top of it the temperature gauge refused to work. Grand Ams also go through wheel bearings like theres no tomorrow, I replaced them at least 5 times. Minor things like the sunroof shade was stuck open, power window broke twice, has some of the hardest to find, and most expensive tire size. It is also one of the worst cars in the snow and living in Buffalo in the winter doesn't help things."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,rocky, 01/07/2009,2001 Grand Am SE,3,I would never buy another car like this. I have had problems with the fuel pump ( 2 times) and the security light 2 time too. I haven't even had the car for two years. Dont ever buy this car
pontiac,grand-am,2001,got 1 of the lucky 1, 04/27/2010,good car but had little problems,4,"I got this grand am With 130,000 miles on it.now it has 174,000miles. had it for 3yrs. i had to change the thermostat just once cause it was heatin up a lil. i change the oil every sungle time. i changed the sparkplugs on my own and the only tIhng i hated was the clicking noise from the hazard signal button. i changed that but still clicks a lil. sound system is great. I never had problems with the intake maifold gasget cause i changed the anntifreeze in the car. its been good to me but im gettin a new car now"
pontiac,grand-am,2001,philly j, 10/08/2010,Satisfied owner,4,"Purchased the GT sedan in 03'and have no regrets! GT looks great and performed well on the road, which is a must for my lead foot. No major repairs until this year (2010) at 160k miles-so the car is unexpectedly reliable. "
pontiac,grand-am,2001,easye93, 11/20/2014,Great first car,4,"I have a 2001 se 3.4 and its never let me down. I've had it for 3 years, and my mom had it for about 4 years before that. It has 242,000 miles on it and it's still going strong. It gets 30 mpg highway too. I've replaced the coolant temp. sensor a couple times, brake pads and shoes, tires and a radiator hose since I got it, and no major repairs were done while my mom had it. Besides the rust behind the doors, it looks great as well. "
pontiac,grand-am,2001,Corey, 05/12/2005,2001 Grand Am GT,3,"I bought this car in August for $7500.00. By the month of October the pwr window regulator went out. The Tranny went out at 114,000 miles in febuary. $2800 to repair. other than these fixes its a fun car but buyer beware."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,mikee4667, 04/26/2014,Poor Quality,2,"I would not recommend this car to anyone.
It had a water leak in the passenger side that shorted out a computer that cost 500 to fix.
3 out of 4 power windows broke, and the passenger mirror fell off when I scraped snow off it.
The security light came on and I had to have a new ignition cylinder put in-another 300.
I traded it in while it was still running.
Just to be clear I changed the oil regularly and kept up the maintenance.
Poor Quality--I can see why Pontiac went out of business."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,monica, 08/19/2006,my car,3,i loved to drive the car. its beautiful and realistic to my family. it's black too
pontiac,grand-am,2001,MisterMarq, 10/26/2009,Great First Car,3,This was my first car. In terms of reliability it was flawless. I drove the car into high mileage territory and always used high mileage oil when getting it changed. The first major hiccup started just recently when the on-board computer started triggering the security switch in the middle of driving - causing the engine to stop. But mechanically it's always just hummed along. 
pontiac,grand-am,2001,driver666, 02/03/2002,Very Satisfied,4,"I have 14000 miles on my Grand Am GT. Overall I am very satisfied. Very comfortable to drive and has plenty of power for today's driving (I am in Southern Calif). Yes, there are more powerful cars of similar size but this one does quite well. I found long distance driving very comfortable. The Monsoon CD sound system is very good (8 speakers). The side pockets in the doors are very handy as is the center console storage. The back seats are very comfortable for 2 average sized adults."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,Steven, 09/24/2005,"Good on the outside, bad in the middle.",3,"I bought this car as a used car with 45,000 miles on it.  The first couple months I had this car I had no problems with it.  Then I was rear-ended at about 30mph and it did over $5,500 in damage, and wasn't totaled.  Since then we have had nothing but problems out of this vehicle, and I've had to buy another vehicle because it's been in the shop so many times.  The build quality, and reliability is absolutely horrible in this car.  I can't believe American made Pontiac would produce such a horrendous car.  The exterior is very beautiful, and the car does turn heads a lot.  But, the downside is that everyone knows about Grand Am's reliability, and I wish I would've know that when I bought it."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,Disgruntled, 03/20/2005,Watch Out!,3,"I purchased this car used with 28,000 kms on it.  I have since put roughly 50,000 on.  I was very satisfied with the car in the first year of running it having run into only minor problems. Things got a lot worse as the car began to fall apart on me.  I have had the following serviced: heater fan/resistor(3x), front calipers (2x), power mirror switch (fell into the doorframe: 3x), ventvalve seal, front power window regualator, hazard warning switch(recall), front brake pads, replaced the driver seat belt, and I don't know how or why but the rear seat came loose.  I have kept up with the maintenance schedule to a tee and I have had countless problems.  I will never buy a GM car again."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,mpt222, 04/05/2002,lame,2,"this car is SSSLLLOOOWWWW and handles 
worse than my old 94 Ford Escort!!  For 
all the flash, it really handles 
poorly, leaning through corners like a 
truck and very non-responsive 
steering.  I am sure this car will wear 
like a typical GM...rust out and be 
worthless in 5 years."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,Lauren.k, 07/05/2008,First Car :(,3,"After one month I noticed a gas smell. Took it to the shop and had a gas leak. Both side mirrors fell off and many electrical things broke inside (seat adjustment, side mirror adjustment). A year later the car just plain quit working. Needed new fuel injection, fuel pump, and fuel filter. Then I totaled it. Sad ending to the pony. I loved the vehicle but too many things went wrong with it."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,molady, 08/04/2008,Pure JUNK,3,"I bought this car used. I guess that was my first mistake. I have had numerous problems. Fuel leaks, brakes, water outlet valve keeps blowing apart, over-heating, now it has been in the shop for a month, replaced fuel pump and filter ($350) and it still won't start. Now while at the shop something with the security system is locked up. The security light is on and the car will do nothing. Anyone wanna buy it? Real cheap!! Pay it off and it's yours!!"
pontiac,grand-am,2001,Mmalchow, 09/24/2008,Engine Problems Beware,2,"When I bought this car I thought that I was getting a pretty good vehicle.  Well that was until the engine started leaking antifreeze from the head gasket, which is pretty expensive to fix and if done wrong could cause more serious problems.  The type of antifreeze that they used in this vehicle caused corrosion and ate away at the gaskets and seals in the engine. Most of which are quite expensive to have replaced and/or serviced, but in order to maintain this vehicle you end up sinking hundreds even thousands of dollars into it.   Also, if you are ever in an accident, regardless of the severity, this car will fall apart.  It has a horrible build quality."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,Briguy, 10/26/2008,Say no to Pontiac!,3,"When I saw this car on the dealer's lot I fell in love with the style in and out. Also the gas mileage was impressive but little did I know this would be the worst running vehicle I had ever owned. Bought with 10K by 28K ABS system failure, serpentine belt, valve lifters, and engine overheating made me have to say bye-bye. Of course GM did it's damnedest to make sure they fixed nothing, solidifying my decision."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,bnosyt, 05/06/2002,2001 Grand Am GT,4,"I really like this car.  It handles 
great, has good acceleration, and is 
comfortable to drive.  I only have 7400 
miles on this car right now, and there 
is nothing to complain about.  I would 
recommend getting the GT rather than 
the SE."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,Lynn, 11/22/2008,"97,000 and still going",3,Bought this car new in 2001. Only problems was computer went out at 3000 miles. Was replaced under warranty. Have not had all the problems like most people have. (Guess I got a good one.) Did replace driver's side window motor. Of course the rear speakers are blown. Isn't everbody's? 
pontiac,grand-am,2001,raven24, 01/01/2009,Maybe I'm the only one,3,"I bought it and when I accelarted, it would hesitate at high RPMs the dealership ran a check, nothing but 2 years later it now may have an engine problem. I've dumped lots of money into small mechanical problems and the car still is having same issues lots of lights on dash, other owners told me same. Never stranded but always at mechanics. My passaenger and driver door have come misalligned and hitting the fenders for no reason. This all stinks because I really am comfortable driving it because I'm petite. it really is the small problems that have given me the headaches. Oh and the clicking noise coming from hazard button, wheel barrons replaced many times but its easy to find parts"
pontiac,grand-am,2001,tcestes, 01/25/2009,Overall a dependable car,4,"I bought mine almost 2 years ago in March 2007. It had 80k on it when purchased. I drive almost 55,000 miles per year for work. And I've gotta say this has been a dependable car. I'm currently at 192k on it and I had to replace the fuel pump 1 time. Other than that it has never left me stranded. And that is very important for my job. On the highway, I regularly got around 30mpg, which is hard to beat. The only recurring problems I've had is the TRAC light coming on, and a strange clicking sound, which I'm told is tied to the ignition system. The security light did come on around 180k but has stayed on with no problems. I've been very impressed with it, it's done the job for me. "
pontiac,grand-am,2001,shannon, 01/26/2009,Looks don't count,2,"I bought this car without doing a lot of research first, mistake ! I wanted it because of the sporty look. It has been one headache after another.I have had to replace the water pump, the brakes multiple times, the traction system is junk. Little things like heater knobs have broken off, heat only works on high, both rearview mirrors have broken off for no reason and the turn signal switch went bad. My mom's full size truck gets better gas mileage! I am doing a lot of research for my next car!"
pontiac,grand-am,2001,rhino61466, 02/12/2009,2001Grand Am SE 2.4L,4,"I have never had any serious mechanical problems with this vehicle. I bought it pre-owned certified with 56,000. It is now up to 98,000 miles and I have only spent 700 in total for repairs, spanning five years. The only problems I had was the ignition  at 98,000 miles and my power windows broke. The key to this vehicle being very reliable is preventive maintenance. If you know nothing about cars and run it into the ground like a Honda you will have problems; however, if you do the normal maintenance such as tune ups/oil changes every 5k miles, fluid flushes, and belt change you should have no problems. If you buy this vehicle and no nothing about how well it was taken care of beware."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,Bobby, 02/17/2009,I love this car,4,"This car was previously my mother's car, but when I turned 16 I took over the ownership of the car. At first I did not like the look and feel of the car but it grows on you. I have made several modifications to the car (grille inserts, cold air intake, decals). I plan to convert the car to rear wheel drive, put the LS9 engine in, and put in a 6 speed manual transmission. I also want to customize the interior as well. I get great gas mileage (average 28 in the summer). I had to replace the water pump and intake manifold gasket each once but I've had no problems now for about 20000 miles. Everything breaks eventually, just spend a little extra money and time to take care of the car. I wash mine 1 per week."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,gonna buy an SUV!, 03/05/2009,I hate this car!,1,"okay so i got this car from my grandpa who bought it new in 01' so far is has 203,000 miles on it. so far my brakes are bad my steering has gone .. i can't pay for everything my fuel pump has gone out to. its goes thru gas like monster. there is a glich in my volume on my stereo. the windows don't work. its noisy and uncomfortable and my brakes stick! i hate this car and no one should ever buy anything even like it!!!!!!!!!"
pontiac,grand-am,2001,RJB, 03/15/2009,Trouble From Day 1,2,I bought this vehicle brand new and it has been nothing but trouble since I drove it off the lot. The warning lights on the dash light up constantly and randomly. You never can tell which lights or group of lights will come on. Of course the dealership never found a thing wrong. It's most recent behaviour is to either stall of have the engine nearly choke off each time you step on the accelerstor. I've had the system gone over with a fine tooth comb and you guessed it. Nothing so far has corrected the problem. This was the first time in my life I had both car payments and repair bills. This vehicle is a true piece of junk. Always has been and always will be.
pontiac,grand-am,2001,lorla_lynn, 05/26/2002,Great Car!,5,"This car is great. This is my 2nd Grand 
Am and would highly recommend this car."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,Jessica, 05/08/2009,Junkyard Special!,2,"I bought this car for $6995.00 in 2007. Within the first 3 days I had the car, the computer went out on it. A few months afterwards, my transmission started messing up. After that, it blew a head gasket. Then the power-steering went out. Then whatever turns the belt under the hood blew up. This car is a piece of junk, and Pontiac should be sued for all they are worth!"
pontiac,grand-am,2001,MikeD, 05/09/2009,AMAZING first car.,4,"If you're thinking of getting an affordable car, then I would definitely put a Pontiac Grand AM on your list. This car is a speed demon, just to warn, the acceleration takes some getting used to at first, but once you've driven it enough, it gets easier. This car is a champion to me, and I've only had it for 2 days. If you can find one for a good price tag, then its a steal. This is the perfect first car, it is sharp and not tacky or too sophisticated at all. Runs great, sounds quiet, handles well and easily.  Shocks absorb any road divots or potholes, just be on the look-out for them though, never know where you will find one, especially in states with a lot of un-paved streets. A+ car!"
pontiac,grand-am,2001,megz629, 01/03/2008,Fun,4,"This car has been very good to me, I bought it used, being the second owner. All I have had to do to the car, is a new battery and new tires. Its fun to drive, gets pretty good gas mileage too. Sound system is great, pretty much enjoy the car overall. "
pontiac,grand-am,2001,LOVE IT, 01/07/2008,Love This Car,4," I bought this car with 75K miles a year ago, and I travel to work 40 miles round trip daily and often across the state.  It's always been very reliable and comfortable to drive.  Very powerful!  The only part I really didn't like was that the turning signals didn't always work, but they were covered under a recall, and were fixed free of charge.  Corners and handles very well, and hasn't let me down in the snow yet.  Heat, A/C, Cruise, Power Locks and Windows.. all work great.  The gas mileage isn't too bad considering the get-up-and-go it has.  Most costly fix was the headgasket after I first got it, which was $600, and the hubs ($400)."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,Chris, 07/21/2009,junk,3,Had trouble from the start. security light shuts down the engine. car wont start. tow about 17 times since I bought it in June 08.  fuel went frame squeaks. not dependable
pontiac,grand-am,2001,JennyinOhio, 09/12/2009,Total Poor Quality - Beware!,2,"This car has given us nothing but trouble. It is poorly made in every regard. Parts have fallen off the car such as the interior door panel reflector and the wing type material above the window. The front hub bearing had an issue, the fuel pump went out, the electrical is very messed up and lights fill the dash at any given time whether or not there is an issue. The repairs it would take to make this car drivable far exceed its worth. Mechanics will tell you how many issues GM's motors are having. Just DON'T DO IT."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,george, 09/13/2009,electrical,3,"An excellent vehicle for good acceleration and power but have had numerous problems with the anti theft system, tire wear is below average, thermostat problems and just replaced alternator at 140,000 mi. It also goes through brake pads quite frequent. Gas mileage not bad for a v6 with power if it was only more reliable."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,xkelsox, 01/31/2010,loved my car,4,"Great car. My dads a mechanic and said it was known that almost every one will blow a headgasket mine did that was the only problem with it \, decent on gas if u drive without a lead foot, wasn't that great in winter I recommend putting studded tires on it, controlled way better in snow with them. Very sporty! My inside was loaded very Nice leather, car would heat up really quick in winter that was a plus! All in all love the car "
pontiac,grand-am,2001,Chris.I, 02/13/2010,Torn between giving a good or bad review,3,"I Bought my Grand Am in 2004, with 38k miles on it. I recently traded it in last week with 103k miles, and the dealership gave me $900 trade in value on it. I never really had any MAJOR issues, but had tons of minor issues, like 2 electrical issues, Drivers side power window broke, Both rearview mirrors broke, Oil change light constantly on (even right after an oil change), Trac system light comes on whenever I turn a sharp corner, Dials fell off, radio volume faded in & Out. last problem I had was everytime I stopped at a red light, the car would putt, like it wanted to stall, So I got a tuneup, hoping it would fix the problem, which it didn't. Overall I loved the car, but It had to go"
pontiac,grand-am,2001,chasenally, 03/08/2010,Not Too Bad,4,"I am reading about the repairs that people are having done.  When the gasket went out due to the type of antifreeze, my mechanic fixed it for under $500, I have had the car into the shop a few times in the five years I have been driving it and it hasn't cost more than $500 each time.  I have driven 75K miles on it and am now selling it, but only to get a car with less mileage.  Just maintain it well.  I have no problem with how it was built or how it runs.  The antifreeze problem was unfortunate, but not expensive."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,Romine, 03/08/2010,Very Decent Car!,4,"I bought this car about a year ago and it had about 157,000 miles on it.  The lady I bought it from used to drive down gravel a lot and I had to replace a hub and an outer tire rod... security light came on and cause my car to not start for 10 min each time as well as my idol staying at 1200 rpm but fix both problems by pulling out the ignition and cleaning the sensors. Excellent sound system and got 37 mpg believe or not the last road trip I made.  It's had its ups and down and have put about $700 into it but only bought it for $1500.  Take care of it and it will treat you right... if you don't, it will let you know.  Mine now has over 170,000 and still runs like a champ. "
pontiac,grand-am,2001,draybike67, 10/02/2013,best car we ever owned,4,"we have put 239,895 miles on this car with no major repairs at all. Still runs and drives great,gets 28 mpg highway. auto trans still works perfect.
we replaced
the water pump at 189k ,replaced radiator at 200k miles. 
All you have to do is maintain your car and it will last just like ours. we are afraid to sell this car because it has been so great.
we also have a 1996 gmc suburban with 278,000 miles and only had to rebuild the trans at 167k, and one fuel pump at 103k.
it still runs like new. "
pontiac,grand-am,2001,GTowner, 06/25/2002,Nice car but...,3,"I've had my GT about a year and half.  
I was very happy with it for the first 
year, but lately I've become a little 
disappointed.  The brakes have a 
terrible feel (which the dealer tells 
me is normal), I've had gas guage 
sending unit and turn signal switch 
replaced, and had the computer updated 
for a problem with the starter.  All 
this as I inch closer to the end of the 
warranty.  In spite of these issues, 
the car has plenty of power (especially 
in the 3000 RPM range), handles well 
and is comfortable to drive.  If only 
they would add the supercharger they 
keep teasing us with..."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,KNOFAC, 07/07/2010,"All right, I suppose.",3,"This was my 2nd car, and it was average.  Got it used in 07, with about 79,000 miles. The interior is a little cramped despite being a larger coupe.  The exterior is sporty and attractive. However, the car never ran too great. It didn't have much kick in terms of acceleration.  It's not a very good shock-absorbing car; you can feel every bump.  The nagging issue: no matter how many times I reset it, the check oil and ABS lights would not stay off.  I took care of it, got routine maintenance, and didn't put a whole of of wear and tear on the car, but I don't think it would've lasted long if I was putting 10,000+ miles on it."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,BadCar, 08/23/2010,Wish I'd never seen this car,2,"When I bought the car, it was just a few months old. It had been a fleet car and had only 11,000 miles on it. The main problem I have had is with the electrical system. It has gone out countless times at almost $400 a pop to get it fixed. The dash warning lights all come on at any given time, but then I can shut it off and restart it and they go out. The passenger side mirror fell off. The brakes need replacing every year. The drivers side power window went out. I was driving down the highway at 70 mph. and it just quit for no apparent reason. Of course it had no power steering or brakes, so that was fun trying to pull off the road. Also my CD player went out within a year of purchase."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,bob, 09/01/2010,Don't buy it,2,"I've had this car 6 years, and I've had ALL 4 power windows stop working (won't go down or up), I had 2 repaired and gave up on other 2. I got it with 32k miles, it has 84k now, at about 60k miles, the transmission failed. Had to have it rebuilt for about 2 grand. Ignition switch failed. Power steering pump failed 2 times. Power steering rod failed. Brakes had issues at about 75k miles, and again are grinding and just don't sound/feel right. Air conditioning still works, but speed settings 1 & 2 don't work, only 3-5 work. Rear view mirror fell off (didn't even touch it), had to re- adhere it. It's still fast, still fun, but I don't know what's gonna happen next. I'm selling it soon, finally."

from the insurance institute."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,lrudd, 10/15/2002,Why did I buy this car??,3,"Bought this car before I checked safety 
rating and I would never buy another 
because of it - what was GM thinking??  
The car is generally ok - but I hate 
having to sink money into a car that is 
less than 2 years old - had to replace 
fuel sender already and $75 for 
emission updates?? What is that all 
about?  One good thing it gets great 
gas mileage."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,gruvygirl1, 07/03/2011,Good first car,3,"This was my first car that I bought used for $4000 with 107,000 miles.
There were a few things that were problematic to begin with -- the driver's side window was difficult to roll down and the air conditioning only worked on speeds 3-5.
Eventually, the entire AC system failed and had to be repaired, which did restore the 1-2 settings.
About a year after purchasing the vehicle, I had to replace both the alternator and the battery.
In the past year, I paid over $600 repairing the ignition switch and the security lock column, only to find that I needed to repair the computer system due to an engine leak, meaning another costly repair, so at 124,000 miles, we finally parted."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,weasel, 11/01/2002,Ok car for the price.,4,"The major complaint I have is all the 
repairs I've had to do to it. Luckily 
they've all been under warranty, 
(which is about to expire). I've had 
the fuel delivery system replaced, the 
front tires replaced, the battery 
replaced, and the computer 
reprogrammed. It does drive nice, and 
the repairs haven't been too major. 
It does give a pulsating vibration 
during idol if you use regular octane 
gas; the higher octanes generally help 
remove this. I do wish they offered a 
manual in the GT; it would have been a 
nice option. I've also gone through 
a set of brakes on the front end."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,Sam, 02/10/2008,Best I've owned,4,"I have not had any repairs outside of normal wear and nothing prematurely.  It holds the road well and it never lacks power.  With good tires well balanced, it's smooth far beyond the legal limit.  I've only undercoated once, and the body is still solid.    I purchased this car, off lease, just over a year old.  I typically only keep a car 2 - 4 years, but I've had this one 5 years and don't have any plans to trade yet."

as soon as I drove home I fell in 
love.  It has good pick up, nice 
comfort in the back, plenty of trunk 
space.  I was overall impressed.  I did 
notice that the pain on the front has 
chipped off from objects hitting it off 
the highway.  I guess I didn't expect 
for it to be like that.  I do think it 
is a good car over all.  I would 
recommend this vehicle to anyone."

new set of wheel bearings and new 
electrical system.  The complaints will 
tell you that GM brakes are terrible 
and and the bearings/electrical system 
is worthless.  When the car isn't in 
the shop, it is slow, and forever 
shaking."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,country city boy, 03/02/2002,se are just as good,4,This is my primary vehicle to drive and I am geet great gas mileage that exceds the mileage listed on the sheet.  20-25 city and 33-36 on the interstate. People complain about the 2.4 but when it drops 2 gears on the interstate it does not seem so wimpy.
pontiac,grand-am,2001,dvp560d, 02/09/2003,This car........,3,"....is a piece of GM junk! The door 
handles feel shoddy and the same for 
the unsensitive steering. The seats are 
thoroughly unsupportive and become 
uncomfortable after only an hour. 
Literally, everything about this car 
feels like it wasn't worth my wasted 
$12,000. The engine is harsh and sounds 
terrible. I've driven Hondas, and their 
engines sound much sweeter. The sound 
system is good until you turn it up 
over the third bar. Then, the bass gets 
floppy and the treble is harsh on the 
ears. If considering this car, please, 
for your own good, change your mind! 
The only good thing about this car is 
the exterior design, which is fair at 
best."

a little over two years and 19,000 
miles.  I've had four problems: 1) at 
9,000 miles - Check engine light - 
Dealership cleaned injectors. 2) Car 
won't start - Dealership replaced 
ignition switch parts (although car 
turned over fine). 3) 19,000 miles - 
Check engine light - cleaned injectors
4) Car won't start - replaced battery.
So the problems were not serious, yet 
not starting once a year is a pain.  "
pontiac,grand-am,2001,rarrr, 08/25/2003,Never Again,3,"I've had my Grand Am almost 2 years now 
and I'd never buy another.  Beginning 
about 3 months ago, my Grand Am has 
been nothing but trouble.  I've put 
almost $1000 into repairs.  The fuel 
pump died, the ignition switch died, 
and now the a/c isn't working 
properly.  On top of that, the turn 
signals only work when they feel like 
it, the interior lights only work when 
they feel like it, and the gauges don't 
register as they should.  General 
Motors has surely let me down."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,mike20, 09/03/2003,Not A Bad Car,4,"I purchased the car with 5.2 miles on 
it in Oct. of 2000 since then I have 
traveled 43000 miles. Ok here are the 
problems I have had at 40 miles SES 
light came on it turns out it was a bad 
seal on the gas tank(no biggie), then 
next problem happened at 27000 miles 
when apparently late one night off of 
work the theft censor kicked in and 
left me stranded, then finally the 
Goodyear tires were making a grinding 
noise at 29000 miles 2 were replaced 
under warranty and I still have the 
other two on which now are making the 
same noise, warranty is up though:(. 
For me its not been that bad of a car."

pontiac,grand-am,2001,structengineer, 10/01/2003,fun ride but poor quality,2,"My car may or may not be typical, but 
it was in the shop four times for 
repairs (wheel speed sensor, fuel level 
sending unit, fan speed control unit, 
head gasket, rusty rotors, loud pinging 
engine when cold).  Once it left me 
stranded on the highway.  The trim was 
loose in places, it got horrible radio 
reception, winshield trim rattled in 
the wind, radio station tuning knob 
turned station #'s the wrong way half 
the time.  Other than the poor quality, 
it was a good car to drive.  The car 
has good acceleration and cornering and 
is fun to drive."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,-chad, 10/18/2003,what i like to like,4,"I bought this car in order to get out 
of another one. It turns out that I 
like it so much, I wouldn't have 
believed it either four months ago. It 
runs well, the service is great, and 
the ride compares with my friend's 
mercedes! The best part: The dash 
lights up red at night and the lights 
are automatic, don't ever worry about 
leaving lights on all night."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,cjfarquhar, 10/16/2003,GRAND AM,4,"This is my third black Grand Am GT.  
All three have been extremely reliable 
up to as much as 110K miles on my 
first - with an alternator and faulty 
gas gauge being the biggest issues 
among them - both covered by warranty.  
I had each of them for four years and 
always have to give it a front break 
job about 2 years in.  

More detailed comments and suggestions 
are below."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,HarborMatt, 11/14/2003,Great for My First Car,4,"This is a great car to have. It has the 
power where it needs it. It's only a 
2.4L I4. It can go quick when i need 
it. Burning out is easy. Just turn off 
the ETS and you can have some fun. The 
Stock System in the Pontiac....just 
great. I only have a tape deck so I use 
a Tape Adapter with my CD Player and it 
pumps out even more bass then just the 
radio. The gauges are sweet at 
night...the red background. The only 
problem that I have had is the Heater 
didn't work but thats no big....just 
went to the dealer and got it replaced 
in like 10-15 minutes. The Gas 
Mileage stinks (15-17 m.p.g. City) but 
you can get some aftermarket parts to 
help with that."

over 100K miles on each one.  Love 
them for reliable transportation and 
peppy performance.  The quad four is 
as good as any foreign engine I have 
owned.  I used to be a Datsun/Nissan 
owner and bought my 1991 Grand Am 
because I got a deal I couldn't 
refuse.  Now I am hooked on this car."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,NB, 09/12/2005,Nice car,3,I think this car has been very good.  The only thing I have to complain about is replacing the brakes...it seems like at least once a year.  Other than that I have not had any problems with it.  I have the SE V6 which has nice pick up.
pontiac,grand-am,2001,j gray, 10/26/2005,Costly Repairs,3,"I purchased the vehicle in 2002 and three years later I've spent thousands in repairs.  I've had to replace the brakes (just once so far, so I guess I'm luckier than others), the power steering pump, the gas sensor (ran out but gauge said it had 1/4 tank), and the blinkers were recalled.  There is also a lot of road noise so it's not a quiet ride."

been out of pocket on this particular 
car."

GT......it's just a fun car to drive. 
Pontiac knew what they were talking 
about when they said they build 
excitment! I knew this car was for me 
when I got in to test drive it. This 
car was all about my personality. So 
far in the years that I've had the 
car, it's been reliable for me. I've 
done my best to keep it in the best 
working order that I can, making sure 
it gets regular visits to the 
dealership. If you haven't driven a 
pontiac, you need to find out what 
it's like to drive one!"

paint chips off front and back bumper. 
May be covered by warrenty."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,Tom A, 02/08/2006,Great sporty daily driver,4,"This has been an exceptional car.  I bought it new in 2000 after owning a 1984 V8 Camaro.  The performance of the GrandAm GT1 with RamAir was nearly the same as the Camaro, but with much better fuel economy.  It has great low-end torque, and accelerates fast.  I like to drive hard, and this car handles it nicely, although I upgraded the wheels to aftermarket R1-Racing ZR18's because the stock wheels felt a little flimsy on hard turns.  Besides the exterior beauty and sporty performance, I love the interior cabin.  The Monsoon sound system is sweet. Passengers routinely comment on the quality of the sound.  The dash is nicely laid out and lit in Pontiac red.  The leather seats are awesome."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,Peter, 04/10/2006,Don't buy,3,"When I first got this car I thought it was great but then I had to replace my gasket intake, check engine light sensor, fuel sensor, oil sensor, front bearings (2x), Turn signal fuse (2x), my LCD of my cd player went out, speakers went out, Lights go out frequently, starter, been through 3 batteries, Brake system repairs, cooling system repairs, and hazard warning switch. What else can I say? I will never buy a GM car.. looking forward to pruchasing a japanese car."

It does it's fun trick of not starting seems to be every 3-4 months, so yep not impressed. Getting it all ok before I get another hefty bill.  I'm on to an import.

This is my second GA.  first was a 1996 
GA GT.  I think the handling of the GT 
was better.  Overall, I have not had 
many problems with car.  I did have to 
replace a tail light seal which leaked 
water into the truck/extra tire 
compartment.  I would think this is a 
good car, but it is not a Nissan, 
Toyota, or Honda.  You get what you pay 
for.  The brakes are not very strong 
which is a known GM problem."

well worth the expense.  Nice

ride.  Comfortable front seats.  Had 
only three problems in 3 years.  
Battery, fan speed control and cruise 
control.  After driving my SUV all 
week, I get in my GT on the weekend and 
feel like I am almost driving a sports

strong. I intend to keep mine for a 
long period of time. "

drive and has a decent amount of power 
for your money.  I did however have 
some problems with it in the 
beginning.  Everytime I turned on my 
blinker it continued to click like 3 
or 4 more times after it was off.  I 
had the dealership do something with 
the wiring now its never made a sound 
since.  My only other problem was the 
it had a little trouble turning over 
when I started the engine.  Then I had 
the dealership upload a hard start 
program on to my cars computer and it 
now starts much better.  The car is 
still on the plus side and fun to 
drive just a few things needed to be 
fixed."

for almost 2 years and another 
dealership offered me $6700 for it. I 
mean come on 2 years ago this thing 
cost 17K brand new...The car is

pontiac,grand-am,2001,Taken, 12/29/2004,Whatta Bust,3,"I had the car for 24 months and it was in the shop 17 times for various reasons.

pontiac,grand-am,2001,Grandma Sue, 01/25/2005,Sorry I bought this car,3,"I love the looks and wanted a sporty v6 and thought I had found it at the right price. But I have had major brake problems which have damaged the transmission, brakes had to be replace in half the time I usually replace them. The motor idles rough. The radio overheats and ruins my CDs. Both my daughter and I get a backache on trips if we are driving. The passenger seatbelt locks when the seat is forward. I won't buy from this dealer or buy another Pontiac, a finincial disaster for me."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,CS400, 05/04/2005,Skip it,3,Overall I had a bunch of problems with this car.  The car is very electrical and I had two major electrical problems in the two years that I owned this car.  The first time an engine lock fuse shorted and my car wouldn't start.  Luckily I was still covered by my warranty or else I would have had to pay over 400 not including towing.  The second time I paid about 400 again to have the thing fixed.  This car isn't so great on gas (but then again I did have a V6)  Also I received a notice from the manufacturer that there was a malfunction with the hazard lights.  I noticed this also with the signal lights every time I used the turning signal it would still click even after being put back
pontiac,grand-am,2001,gmguy, 05/05/2005,good grandam,4,"Very solid car that runs great, only problems so far were covered under warranty. The starter was getting weak, and it is fine since replacement.  Also, the a/c compressor was starting to lock up, causing the belt to smell, it is also working great since replacement.  Overall a good looking and comfortable ride we are happy with."

pontiac,grand-am,2001,FRugar, 09/06/2005,Never Judge A Book By Its Cover,3,"On the outside, the Pontiac Grand AM GT is a beautiful car. It looks like what it claims to be; a sporty mid size coupe that's fun to drive. The interior says the same. And granted, yes, it is. When it runs. I bought mine at 32000 miles when it was 2 years old. Since, I've had nothing but problems such as:  -Bad wheel bearing immediately after warranty expired : $800 -Brake caliper froze: $300 -Brake sensor burnt out, cluster needed to be replaced: $400 -Intake seals popped, leaking AF everywhere: $1200 -Fuel line leakage: $200 -Brake caliper frozen again: $300  And now the fuel pump is blown.

pontiac,grand-am,2001,ssstew, 10/04/2005,"Ok, but could be better",4,"I have had my Pontiac Grand Am for 2 and a half years, and I have had a few problems, but nothing drastic. I do have a loud ticking from the engine when it is cold. And the trim on the windshield is coming off. I love the way it drives and handles. Lots of power and corners great. All in all it is a fun car to drive, but there are some quality control issues Pontiac overlooked when making these cars."

starts. We bought this car a year ago 
with 7800 miles on it and have 35000 on 
it now. Soon after I bought it I had 
troubles with the car starting. It 
usually takes 2-3 times to start (not all 
the time) I've taken it into the 
dealership 3 times about this and they 
just tell me that its a computer quirk 
and there is no cure for it. I would have 
no complaints if it would just start the 
first time. "
pontiac,grand-am,2001,Matt, 01/15/2006,01 Grand Am GT Worst Car Ever,2,"In my opinion the Pontiac Grand Am GT1 is the worst car to ever roll off of an assembly line.  While it only had 18,000 miles when I acquired it from a private party known very well to me who kept it very well maintained and garaged, both window regulators broke, the heater knob busted, constant ""Check Engine"" lights, terrible grinding from the front end (no it wasn't the brakes).  Tried to change a headlight bulb yesterday, after an hour and half of trying to get to it ( I finally did) the headlight retainer ring broke.  I will never ever buy another gm car as long as i live, especially not a pontiac, i wouldn't even buy one with someone else's money"
pontiac,grand-am,2001,D Martinez, 01/29/2006,From Mother to Daughter,5,"When I purchased my red Grand Am GT in 2001 I was looking for a sporty car my teenage children could borrow and not feel like they were driving an ""old- lady"" car. I didn't really expect to enjoy driving it so much myself!  I quickly found it was fun to drive, easy to park and made me smile when I saw it in the parking lot!  It was reliable and served me well!  Recently my daughter was looking for a good used car and I decided to sell her the Grand Am.  She was excited to purchase a great looking car! I was sad to say goodbye to the only sports car I'll probably ever own - and I'm really glad to know it's still in the family!  I highly recommended it for a fun, reliable and sporty ride!  "
pontiac,grand-am,2001,lg9090, 01/31/2006,Bad Mistake,3,"I loved the exterior of the car and it drove great the first six months I had it.  The best decision I ever made was to buy the extended warranty because had I not I would have spent about $4,000 dollars on this car.  It's been to the shop 3X in the past 4 mo. I've repaired the ignition coil module, fuel injector, spark plugs, A/C resistor blower (2X), blinker recall problem, broken a/c knob,  window motor and regulator (not just one, but all 4 windows!!), side mirror fell off, ignition switch, pass lock cylinder, body control module, some sort of connectors and computer body replacement, and I've had it towed 2X!!

Computerized parts only work when they want, several times a month won't start, air works one day next day maybe, maybe not next day yes----same thing with radio lights locks everything! I have but more money into this car than it is now worth. I call it the money pit. I wish I had read these reviews before I bought the car."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,Naomi, 09/16/2006,Never Again,2,I have had numerous problems with my 2001 Grand Am se 2.4 twin cam. There has been so many problems with it and still has problems that  I wouldn't even know where to begin because It's been that rough
pontiac,grand-am,2001,Dave Crump, 09/17/2006,Looks sporty but not very reliable.,3,"I got this car with 83,000 miles on it. First time owning a Pontiac, and I tell you I'll never buy again. Drove it for two weeks and it died in a parking lot and stayed there for 3 days, checked everything my experience told me to look at and changed the crank and cam sensor's and finally gave up and took it to a shop. Charged me $75 to tell me they couldn't find anything wrong with it.( It started right up after having it towed, apparently). The motor has an annoying tap(upper engine), the brakes are the worst I've ever dealt with. It seems like I'm fixing something Bi-Weekly. The car also has a lot of electrical glitches that are annoying. Cup holders are way to small and in the wrongplace"
pontiac,grand-am,2001,kbrooks136, 10/03/2006,no problems till now,4,Up 'til today i have not had no problems with my grand am i do regular oil changes and maintains but i love my grandam... would take nothing for it right now.
pontiac,grand-am,2001,spurge27, 02/08/2012,Alright,4,"I've had mine for almost 11 months and the only thing needed replaced was the fuel pump which as I've read is one thing that normally goes.
I've yet to change my brakes or anything like that so maybe its just my car.
I did have to keep dumping anti-freeze into my car but checked and found it was just a hose that went bad which I just ficed with liquid aluminum.
Other then that this car drives smooth, gets good gas mileage (18-19 cty, 26-27 hwy), fast, good looking, and will get you where you need to go. I got mine with 98,000 miles on it and it is at 120,000 now with only that one problem.
Would I recommend this car, no.
Would I say that its a decent car, yes! "
pontiac,grand-am,2001,jasdva, 02/29/2008,do you really wanna,2,"Sure the cars and everything about them look great, but after so long they end up leaving you stranded.  It's all due to the security/passlock system (e.g. the ignition switch and the electrical part of that switch).  Read all the post on Edmunds.com about this problem before going out and buying a Grand Am."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,college4life, 04/01/2007,Always breaking! Do not buy!,1,This car is the biggest piece of junk ever made! Do not ever buy a Grand Am. I've replaced so many things in my car I thought a longtime ago there couldn't possible be anything else that could break. I was wrong. Now it's the stupid passlock system that just on occassion won't let your car start and you have to turn the key to the on position for 1min. to let it reset then start it.  Do not ever buy a Grand Am!
pontiac,grand-am,2001,I'm Awesome, 08/14/2007,Decent,3,"The car hasn't given too many problems. We've put 100,000 miles on in just 7 years, and for an American car, I'd say its pretty decent. We've had had some electrical problems and fuel problems."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,Mark, 09/12/2007,No trouble with mine,4,"I bought mine in 2005. I would tell anyone that it is a good starter car. Easy to drive and fun. Streeing it tight and I have only done normal work on the car. Oil, brakes, rotors, normal everyday car work. Good luck with yours."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,craigo19, 09/12/2007,Looks Nice,3,"I just traded mine in last weekend, but wanted to recap 6+ years of ownership. The car was a good and fun car to drive, but it did have issues. First, the engine went after 120k miles when the timing belt went. Then the Body Control Module went costing me another $1000. The wheel bearings started going after 75k miles. The window regulator on the drivers side went in less than 4 years. Finally the blower motor went in under 4 years. The car did provide a good smooth ride and got great gas mileage (30MPG)."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,Chris J, 10/22/2007,Excellent Car,4,"This is my second Grand Am. We still own our first which is a 2000 SE. Overall, and aside from the intake manifold problem (which our wounderful dealership repaired free of charge), our Grand Ams have been excellent cars. Not once have either of them ever let me down. Proformance and comfort at superb with the tourqy 3.4 V6, and the leather seats make long trips relaxing. The stock sound system is absolutely amazing, and the red backlit dash is easy on the eyes. I plan on keeping my GT for as long as possible, and im thankful I havent recieved the problems others seemed to have had. Only other probem Ive had was a loose electrical wire, which was fixed in minutes at my dealer."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,jstar, 11/18/2007,Great,4,I bought this car a little over a year ago and I love it. I have 150000 miles on it now and have never had a problem except replacing the alternator. I hope the newer Grand Prix is just as reliable because I think I'm hooked on Pontiac.

pontiac,grand-am,2001,aeguy202, 05/01/2003,2001 Tan Grand Am SE,4,"Bought the vehicle in late January and 
havent had any problems since. The only 
drawback is that the gas mileage isnt 
as great as I would have hoped. But 
other than that, the car gets me where 
I want to go and is very relaxing. I'm 
hoping the car will get me through 
driving back and forth with college."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,Dumplins, 06/14/2003,Lots of problems,4,"Had car for 30 miles and it had to be 
serviced 7 times.  Computer failed 
twice, wouldn't start, heater went out, 
oil leak, wouldn't start again, and 
something else.  (I can't remember 
because I have had to take it in so 
many times)"
pontiac,grand-am,2001,BigCoop, 06/23/2003,Good Deal,4,"Nice engine, could use more horsepower 
but lots of torque.  Handles well, 
STICKS to turns.  Sound system is great 
for a stock and steering wheel controls 
are nice.  Reliability needs to be 
better, so far I've had a fuel gasket 
replaced as well as a leak in the 
radiator and currently I need the 
brakes machined (get a pulsing when 
breaking - a common pontiac problem) 
and my engine is giving me problems as 
well.  Feels like I'm dropping it into 
gear when shifting from neutral to 
drive and between 1st and 2nd. Apart 
from the problems, driving it is a 
blast and it looks sharp."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,Unhappy, 12/05/2007,Hate it,3,"I hate this car! Horrible gas mileage (19-20 in town and 24 at best highway), uncomfortable on any trip longer than 15 minutes, and poor turning radius. My full size pickup gets better gas mileage! The cup holders are annoyingly small- I can't even fit a small size drink because the lid hits the heater controls. There may be a leak in the duct work because my feet always freeze in the winter as not enough warm air is blown out. Rear defroster just quit working. It has a lot of road noise and the front driver's side window leaks air. Looks sporty and cool, (especially the GT edition), but looks aren't enough! I will never buy a Pontiac again."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,angel, 04/12/2008,Bad handling and always something wrong,3,"I bought this car thinking that Pontiacs are good car. Sure it looks nice on the outside and inside but its a piece of junk. I have put it in the ditch 3x, the handling sucks, the thermostat goes out and the brakes I replace every couple months. Not to mention several electronic things from time to time need to be constantly replaced"
pontiac,grand-am,2001,docholliday1, 09/20/2011,Well worth the ride!,4,"Have had my GT for 9 years (was a year old when I got her) and haven't regretted it.
Fun to drive, plenty of power and great road handling.
Major expense in all that time was the head gasket.
Brakes need to be replaced more often than I was used to, and had to figure out the work-arounds for the fake codes that appeared a couple of times... but overall a fun and reliable car."
pontiac,grand-am,2001,jlripl, 05/16/2008,Love it!,4,"In 2003, I found a car I loved.  A sporty red 4 door 2000 Grand Am GT.  Test drove it and took it home, no problem.  Three months later, it was totaled. Head on crash with an extended bed, extended cab half ton pick up truck. I refused to drive for the next three months until my dealer found me a 2001 Grand Am GT, just like my old one.  I have absolutely adored this car. I wouldn't trade it for the world.  I think I put so much faith in it because the older version got me through a horrible accident with only a broken arm.  I have had very few problems, and would recommend it.  I've had it for four years, bought it with 47,000 and it now has 127,000.  Runs great. Had one issue with the key."

pontiac,grand-am,2001,Riley Tate, 07/19/2017,Insanely reliable if taken care of,4,"Bought the car at 185,000 miles for 800 bucks. Did regular maintenance on it. Spark plugs. Brakes. Rotors. Fuel filter etc. Only problem with it was fuel system leaks which were relatively cheap fixes. One of the fastest, cheap and stock cars I've ever driven. Won multiple street drag races with it. Puts Honda's to shame. Over 220,000 miles now. Multiple cross country road trips. And daily work driver in city and highway. Beautiful car all around. Never let me down.
"
pontiac,grand-am,2001,Mandy, 11/11/2018,Love it,4,"Purchased my 2001 Grand Am listed as an SE 1 but this review site doesnt have the 3.4 liter option. My car has 3.4 liter but even says on the body emblem SE. Paid 400 cash from local dealer. Needed front brakes right off and had what sounded like bad lifter. Turned out was a plug wire unplugged when changing plugs and wires. Has 268000 miles. Still fires right up and goes. Losing antifreeze but not sure where. No leaks as far as ive found. No sign its going into the block. Flush and filled in September, its now November and had to add antifreeze. Also needed a quart of oil. Not over heating. Hoping to last til i get something else so I can vuy an engine rebuild kit. Does need new back wheel bearings and an alignment all the way around. I turn the ETS off as I found I get better traction with it off.

pontiac,grand-am,2002,Ali2681, 05/15/2010,Passlock problems,4,"Until this year I have never had a problem with my Grand Am.  I loved the car....that is until I started getting stranded all the time.  Everyone says to wait 10 min with the key on but I always end up waiting at least 40.  And it's not always my security light that goes on it's the service engine soon, trac off and ABS.  I am getting really tired of having to sit in parking lots for up to an hour waiting for my car to start, how will I go grocery shopping when it's hot!?  This is a BIG problem and GM needs to do a recall on this issue.  I have always had a problem with the brakes on this car too."
pontiac,grand-am,2002,alan2123, 05/05/2013,been great so far!,4,"We have owned this car since it was brand new. it now has 209400 miles on it! I've out in an alternator, window wiper motor, and a new ignition. it still needs a couple things, like a new indicator switch because it makes a ticking noise while off, but for how long it's lasted and the little work its needed, it has been a great car! it still runs great, and I'll probably get it up to 250000 miles before I sell it."

I have a problem tha Pontiac has refused to take resposiblity for. The dash pad has started to roll up, has broken the plastic defrost deflectors now the window will not defog properly (safety hazzard).
The passenger side air bag is in the dash under the loose dash pad.
The airbag is designed to punch thru the pad but with pad being loose it will not function properly and the loose dash pad will impact the passenger instead of the airbag..(safety/deadly hazzard) would like to know how to fix this problem.
9 of 10 gran ams I have looked at have the same problem.
The subquality glue is letting go."
pontiac,grand-am,2002,Cracky, 02/08/2010,Timing Chain eats engine,3,"So much for regular maintenance and synthetic oil.  The 2002 2.2L ecotec has a child's bicycle chain to drive the cams and it, like thousands of others , have failed.  GM knew this.  They made improvements in 2003.  They sent dealer bulletins but not a word to the owners.  I think this is a very poor way to do business.  I visited the dealership and got a world class cock and bull story with an offer to take my car in trade for $125 dollars. I'm done with GM... forever."
pontiac,grand-am,2002,Kayla, 02/18/2010,my cat,4,This car has been absolutely amazing untill I had to get the motor redone. The passenger side window had to be replace once the wire broke and it fell. This is the second one ive owned.. Other than the problems i recently had with the motor.. it has been great I would recommend to anyone as long a they were willing to keep it well taken care of!
pontiac,grand-am,2002,rklister, 06/02/2006,rmk,4,The car has perfromed without problem in all types of weather from sub-zero to the heat of the summer.  Never a problemin starting or operating.

We had to replace the passlock system twice, fuel pump, driver's side window motor, something else under the hood that was $600 (My husband isn't home and I can't remember the name of it) and the list goes on and on. We have poured roughly 5-6 thousand dollars into this car since we bought it.  On repairs that were required unless we wanted the car as a lawn decoration.  Pontiac should have stepped up and recalled so many of these problems.  I will never again in my life buy another GrandAm, or anything within that family.  "

I am just now (in mid 2013) through steps to fix it up a little to resell or trade in.
I was attracted to it because I could by afford it, and it had a pretty sexy looking body style, an ergonomic interior design, and a nice little dose of low end torque.
It was a bright red car and I dubbed it 'the Ferrari.'
I have been through a lot with it and have kept it so long that I have spent almost as much insuring it as I did to buy it.
The downside is that it is a General Motors car from an era where the passenger cars where he trim, plastics, and electrical systems suffer from poor design and durability."
pontiac,grand-am,2002,multani4, 09/13/2012,Severe engine problems,3,Great when bought brand new. but beware of engine problems. #1 lower intake leaks.

pontiac,grand-am,2002,Ray Lussier, 03/20/2002,A lot of car for the money,4,"Bought at cost plus the 2002 rebate.  Got a lot of car for the money.  Got the v6 engine and love the way it performs.  The controls are well-laid out, and the steering and handling are good.  Does not have the build quality that toyota or honda have, but for the money I paid, I'm quite happy."

an '02 SE1, I even got the same color. 
This one is loaded, except the V6. 
Differences? You can turn the DRL's 
off, but the parking lights remain. 
Chimes for the various reminders are 
not as loud as they were in the '99. A 
nifty cup holder was added on the 
console. The new 2.2 liter 4 cylinder 
engine vs the 2.4. I keep reading about 
how smooth & quiet the new 2.2 is. I 
find the new engine to be loud, it 
makes a clicking sound even @ idle. The 
car is less torquey, fuel mileage is 
exceptional. 2 nagging concerns on 
build quality. A rattle in the roof 
liner near the moonroof button. Plastic 
pieces in my car are not flush."
pontiac,grand-am,2002,shopgirl24, 06/24/2008,Love this car!,4,"I bought this car 3 years ago with 19k miles on it. It now has about 60k miles; I have had to replace the O2 sensor once (about $300). Otherwise my only expense has been the usual maintenance - oil changes and first full round of tires 4 months ago. This car has been extremely reliable, and is a great family vehicle. It also gets decent mileage for its size; I get 28 mpg city/hwy combined. It is also quite stylish for the price and fun to drive! I am very satisfied with my purchase."

I commute to work via train so my mileage stays low & I only use it on weekends around town.  It has gone to neighboring states for family visits & a trip from IL to AK once, hence most of the mileage.  I've been through window clip replacements, brakes, battery, tires/wheels, and thought I had the steering shakes corrected while under warranty but never could get to the bottom of it.  The car shakes at 55 mph so we take my husband's car for trips that require high speed.  Just this week I noticed a squeaking/rattle coming from what might be suspension/under carriage?  I should have stayed with Honda.  Again, only 40,800 miles!!!!!"

Minor coolant leak that doesn't worsen. Had overheating probs and check engine issues all eventually traced to clogged caty convertor. Runs like new now. Nice to drive, easy on gas, plenty of zip. Until the caty went berserk was fairly trouble free. Makes a nice first car for a student. I'm 5'11 265 and can easily get in and out. tight fit for 3 in the back and trunk holds a three bowling ball bag plus set of golf clubs and a couple gym bags. On fishing trips my rear seat stows extra gear. Will pull my 17' boat w/ trans cooler and still gets decent mileage but struggles a little up steep hills."

But yeah good mpg, very rust resistant, lots of power for lil' 4 cyl, after 9 months still reliable.
Problems: The seats and various useless plastics are breaking. The previous owner wore down the springs, catalytic converter went (I hear this is a common problem, I bought mine online $75 and had Tuffy put it in $45.

It has a great stereo system in it as well. I am planning on upgrades upgrades onto it, even though it is extremely nice the way it comes from the factory. The car could come with a larger engine, and the sc/t spoiler should take place of the current spoilers for gt models. The wheels are the best wheels I have seen that acually come with the car. The ride is exceptionally smooth, and it is a great value for what you pay for the vehicle."

Adequate pickup from the V6, but GM should be able to extract more power from it.  The Monsoon audio system is a nice feature, but would be nicer with an in-dash CD changer."
pontiac,grand-am,2002,capnvonbaron, 05/14/2008,Love/Hate Relationship,4,"I fell in love with it the moment I saw it at the dealer. Finally, a car that didn't look like a dumb Toyota!  For a long time it was great.  Then a series of maddening little problems cropped up. Brakes are too small, easily overheat & warp. Turn signal clacker frantically clacks all by itself at random. Rear speakers rattle at 80K miles. CD player sometimes has a mind of its own. Theft deterrent system will occasionally shut off the ignition system for no reason (easy fix, but takes 20 minutes). Dexcool coolant system is stupid. Original battery blew a cell, shocks started squeaking at 65K. Overall, I love how it looks and drives, but the little problems keep it from being truly great."

haven't had to do anything major on it since owning it, biggest annoyance is that every time i have something break and i can't figure out what is broken to cause my problem i find the answer online telling me that this crap happens all the time on this model. lots of interior pieces broke or warped due to gm using plastics that deteriorate after 5 years, as i was told by a gm employee.
lots of little quirks, but car has never left me stranded.

The manual says that it started with 17 hp but with all my work it is probably around 225 hp now. I have ot say it is super fast. It is auto but when I drop it into first and work it like a stick I can pull a 5 second 0-60. My top end I actually beat a v8 camaro from 60-120. It is a great ride. The only complaint is in the manifold the gaskets keep breaking. They are cheap and plastic surrounded by metal so they will break in all of your cars promise. But take good care of ur car and I guarantee ur car will return the favor. Good buy"

I thought for sure I'd have some problems, since it was a rental.... nope none... It went up to 60k miles before the blower motor resistor went, then at 80k miles the head and upper manifold gaskets went, due to DEXCOOL turning into acid and eating the gaskets and clogging my radiator. Fortunately, the car is easy to work on and I actually replaced the gaskets myself and the car runs great again. Now at 90k miles, nothing else major has broke... Only needed brakes twice, though now the shocks are starting to squeek and the A/C clutch is worn. But everything else is great."

These are mostly highway miles and we're not rough with the car.  I would expect a car company who is trying to compete with the likes of Honda and Toyota to  sell a decent vehicle.

I have read a lot about this subject on message boards so I took my radio out to look at the yellow wire. Someone had soldered it to the black wire. I disconnected it from the black wire but left the yellow wire cut. Now the car won't even turn over let alone start. I wish I had never bought this car.
pontiac,grand-am,2002,Anonymous, 12/07/2010,grand am,3,"This is the most miserable car I've ever owned. The same three problems happen every year (window regulator, blower motor, transmission.) I paid $10,000 for it in '04 I've put approx $6,000 into it in repairs. I will never own another pontiac again based on the performance of this car."
pontiac,grand-am,2002,Eldon McElhiney, 10/19/2002,My Second One,4,"Last Grand Am was a 93 model.  It gave 
me 5 years of ""no payements"" and while 
pushing 200,000 miles, was  still 
running like a top when I traded it for 
the new style that I wanted!

What a great car!"

pontiac,grand-am,2002,Robert, 10/28/2010,Great car! But,3,"This was my first real car and I absolutely loved it!  The car was great in the snow, handled the highway very well and looked so good on the outside that an additional custom paint job on the hood had passers by turning their heads and giving thumbs up!  The GT version is not overly common and I enjoyed having a car that separated me from the cars that my friends drove around."

Have had to replace rear window motor twice, catylitic converter 70k (free), both cylinder head gaskets 80k, fuel pump 80k, brakes 80k, two sets of tires 85K &100k. Upgraded to better tread on second set of Yoko's with 30k so far. Get intermittent turn signal failures and switch noise when not in use. Security light on rarely, but does not disable engine start. Transmission hard shifting occasionally and have to shut and restart engine to resolve. May be electronic or going out. Oil changes and maintenance regularly. "

it's just an overall awesome experience."
pontiac,grand-am,2002,jimdes, 07/26/2008,Good Riddance!,3,"I thought I'd be stuck with this car, but fortunately, I totaled it.  It was nothing but trouble from day 3.  First, the radio had to be replaced because it was draining the battery when the car was parked. Then there was a series of electrical issues, primarily with the brake warning lights coming on indicating the ABS and ETS were not functioning.  Pontiac didn't know how to fix this and just told me to keep driving it.  Finally, on the 5th attempt, it was fixed.  There's also a common issue that the blinker sound will come on while driving.  Thank God I purchased a 60K warranty on this when I bought it brand new!  My partner, on the other, hand purchased a 2002 Grand Am SE1 and had 0 probs"

i want from the car and has a lot of 
room for a car that is considered a 
midsize car.so far not one problem and 
am always smileing to my car when i'm 
about to drive it .its styling is quite 
distinctave and my only problem is that 
there are too many grand ams on the 
road ,but i must remind myself that 
only a few are GTs!!!....if i had a say 
in future grand ams is that they should 
have locking gas caps,and a power 
antenna.oh one more thing lighted visor 
mirrors!!!!!thank you pontiac."

stick and radio?"
pontiac,grand-am,2002,sweetmusic, 04/25/2002,Best when comparing,4,"This is my third Grand am and my first 
6cyl.  I also bought it withe the SC/T 
hood.  It is exteremly sharp looking 
and is one of the few in town, at least 
for the time being.  I test drone cars 
like the 2003 TiburonGT, Stratus R/T 
and camaro, and the Grand am drove 
better and I got it loaded for the same 
if not less than those other cars."
pontiac,grand-am,2002,Alex T, 04/25/2002,"Awsome, sporty, and perfect for teens",4,"My parents bought me the SE 4-cylinder 
after my other car broke down. This car 
is great to drive and picks up chicks 
left and right. I had to have the 
cruise control module replaced after 
the first 3k miles but have had no 
other problems. The wiring in the car 
is a little funny, so have any alarm or 
keyless entry system done by a pro. 
This car is very quick even for being 
140 horse. Overall I love this car and 
would reccomend it to anyone!"
pontiac,grand-am,2002,ronnie, 09/24/2008,Never again,3,"I absolutely loved this car. Even though it would bottom out from time to time. And the head lights seemed to get very dirty very fast. Then the warranty ran out. Then the draining of my pocketbook started. The driver's window mechanism has been replaced twice.  The spark box module needed to be replaced. Now the timing chain has went and I need a new motor! My mechanic says that this particular size motor (2.2) in his particular (2002) year has had this problem with both the Windows and the timing chain ruining the rest of the motor. From reading the other reviews, I see that this is true.  I hope that people read these before they buy a grand am.  I sure wish that I did! "
pontiac,grand-am,2002,skytech, 11/15/2008,"Sharp car... good performance, handling",4,"Bought this car with 30K on it. Loved the styling better than previous model years. Generally I have been satsfied with the reliablity, performance and handling. I have driven 37K since I bought it. It has good acceleration (fuel economy has been 17 city to 26 highway MPG). It takes a bit of experience to get the most from the 3.4 V6 power band. The automatic shifts nicely but it is a basic style and leaves something to be desired. I wished I had looked for a 5 speed manual. Seats are comfortable but a bit wide to hug my slim build (I'm 5'11"", 168lbs.). Cornering is nice but a Corvette it is not. driver power window broke once (common so I hear). Cold engine ticks slightly but quiets."

a Grand Am with 54K miles that had 
never been in the shop except for oil 
changes (and a little bit of body 
work).  We have only a few hundred 
miles on the new car, but it sure seems 
solid, quick and gets 30 mpg...  not 
bad for the way I drive :)"

start.  

List of repairs...
1) 5 trips to the shop for leaking 
water when it rains.  Problem continues.
2) Driver side window quit working.
3) Electric driver seat control quit 
working.
4) Gas gauge sending unit went out.
5) Service engine soon light came on at 
23,000 miles."
pontiac,grand-am,2002,George, 01/06/2009,Fast Good looking Fun but,4,I bought it new in sept 2001. It now has 65K miles on it. Power window motor repaired replaced 4 times. Turn signal stalk replaced. Blown intake manifold gasket replaced at 60K. Power seat broken 3 times and gave up having it fixed. Cost of repairs over 7 1/2 years is about 1500 which I guess isnt bad. Regular oil changes and 1 set of tires and brakes at 55K.  I love the car but the darn 3.4s have a history of bad manifold gaskets. My 95 Grand Prix had same problem but no untillo 165K

car has lived at the dealership since 
week one.In the first 30000 miles I had 
replace the power steering pump,the 
coolant bottle due to a leak,the intake 
manifold seal due to a leak,rotors 
replaced once & resurfaced once,very 
rough idle that the service dept can't 
find,noise from front end that I am 
told the tires are walking on the rims. 
The check engine light has come on & 
off but they can find no stored codes.I 
could go on forever.I work on the road 
& this is very inconvenient."

far and I couldn't be more pleased. I
initially had a problem with the brakes
but the people at Suttle motors in 
Newport News took care of it post haste
and there has been no re-occurance, The 
interior and exterior styling are out 
of this world (even though there are a 
lot of these babies on the road

pontiac,grand-am,2002,BHans, 05/31/2002,Solid performer; annoying problems,4,"Solid car, but a few problems include 
the terrible steering wheel shake at 
75+ mph.  I've heard it's from the 
tires and that they don't fit the rims 
correcty.  Whatever it is, it's 
annoying, and it doesn't go away.  The 
tires also make noises that resemble 
that of a brake pad rubbing on the 
rotor.  Overall, not too bad, just a 
few annoying problems with the 
tire/wheel setup (which no matter how 
many times I've brought the car in, 
they say it's just natural and will go 
away on it's own.)  If I had to do it 
all over again, I'd probably think 
twice."
pontiac,grand-am,2002,Grand Am Driver, 06/10/2002,"Great Car, but not Perfect",4,"This car is a joy to drive everyday.  
The ram air V6 that I have preforms 
beyond my expectations for an american 
car, as does the sporty suspension.  In 
black, my car has earned the nickname 
of ""Batmobile"" among most of my 
friends.  The feeling of driving this 
car on winding country roads can only 
be paralleled by the likes of small 
sports cars and expensive import sport 
sedans.  All in all, a bargain at only 
$22,000."

out!  The performance is adequate.  To 
all the people that have the check 
engine light appear randomly...instead 
of blaming the car, why don't you read 
your owners manual and educate 
yourselves.  The check engine light

pontiac,grand-am,2002,Pj, 06/26/2010,Great Car,4,"I bought this car in the middle of winter as a gift to myself.  It had 131,000 miles on it when I purchased from a local dealer.  High miles, and since it was the GT I knew it had been driven hard and put away wet, but it was so sharp I had to buy it.  I had the car for two years  and never had a problem other than regular maintenance and an occasional fuse blowing.  I drove the car like it was a race car, the handling was incredible, and the engine ran like a dream, plus people really took notice of it's awesome monsoon sound system, that thing would boom!"
pontiac,grand-am,2002,kdoyea, 06/28/2002,Went Back and got another,4,"I foolishly got rid of my 2000 red GT, 
when I wanted to go down a car, (we had 
too many). However we have gone back 
and got one now, 2 yrs later, in an 
awesome color they did not have on my 
2000. POLO GREEN, it is gorgeous! 
However, I was a little bummed they 
changed the mirrors to be like the 
Alero's, ie: no vent thru, like the 
Grand Prix's, and they changed the side 
ribbing/cladding a little, but the new 
polished wheel style and monsoon system 
is great!"

while I was shopping for a new car. I 
did lots of research before buying the 
Grand Am GT and feel I made the right 
decision. It looks great, has 
impressive interior space, loaded with 
lots of useful features, excellent 
performance and handling, and is priced 
right. As someone who drives 25,000 
miles per year, this car fits all my 
needs. Test drive one for yourself - 
you won't be disappointed."

pontiac,grand-am,2002,VazDdrae, 11/02/2010,Great Car. Will Buy Another Again.,4,"This is my first car, which was bought from a craigslist seller. At first I didn't care to much for it since it was common, but i later realized how nice this car really looks compared to others I see on the road today. The interior is nice, and easily customizable. The exterior of the car is nice, and looks sporty. I have had only one issue with it. It died once at a stop sign, it started back up and was fine and had not had this problem for over a year now. When my brother gets this car, I will probably just buy another (newer) Pontiac Grand Am."

2002 Grand Am SE1. The Grand Am is a 
great car for its value. Even though I 
opted for the 4 cyl it is still fun to 
drive and can keep up with everyone 
else. The interior is very creative 
with the large round vents and the 
thoughtfully designed dash. The seats 
are comfortable and very supportive 
great for long trips. I would recomend 
the car to anyone."
pontiac,grand-am,2002,JamesMIV, 08/10/2002,ALL GOOD,3,"I love the my Grand Am, just wished 
that I could have affored the Grand 
Prix.  The only major maintance that 
it need was a replacement of the lower 
intake manifolds.  After it was 
replaced I got better performance from 
it.  All in all the GrandAm is a good 
starter car, but if you have the extra 
money I would recommened the Grand 
Prix GT just because of the larger 
size and increased performance."

buy another one!  I went for the GT

it doesn't cost much more and well 
worth it.  I love the bigger engine, 
the tighter suspension, the Goodyear 
Eagles, and the monsooon stereo!"

had to replace a rim on the car and 
that was $180.  This was the worst car 
I have ever owned.  The car was made 
very poorly."

car accident. After my wife and 2 
children both under the age of 2 walked 
away from the crach without so much as 
a scratch or bruise we decided we would 
only buy another Grande Am. We got a 
bit of an uprgrade buying a GT and i 
have been thrilled with the car to this

Corollas, and Siennas and I am used to! 
That must be why I liked it so much, a 
VERY cool car, it will definatly wake 
you up from the boringness of most 
other cars in its class! Another thing 
that I loved was the sound system. Oh, 
I could go on and on about that! It 
played CDs so perfectly clear, it was 
the first factory stereo system that I 
have ever seen that could actually play 
heavy bass."

This has been a reliable car for me. Mostly daily driving - school, work, etc. Mostly a town driver, then drove about 25 miles away daily for college. The only serious problem I had was a misfire and a new coil pack fixed that. Routine oil changes, brake pads and tires have been all this car has needed. I drove this car from Wisconsin to Tennesee and back at about 130,000 miles and it did wonderful. I get 24-26 mpg city and probably 30-32 highway. All in all, no big complaints. I do think the car is kind of ugly on the outside but oh well :)"

Malibu LS for this one...making me

also own an '02 Alero GLS, which would 
seem to be almost identical

complaint is the cheap bumper.  living 
in NYC, the parking is tight and i 
often find a new black scratch and dent 
in my silver bumber when the other car 
just taps my car.  its called a bumber 
for a reason....its should act like

the problems other reviewers have had.
The handling is on par with sporty 
Europeans, and the engine is powerful 
enough so you don't really need a 
stickshift. This is the first automatic 
car I have had that actually performs .
The ride is surprisingly quiet, and you 
just have to love all the little

pontiac,grand-am,2002,Pop-A-G, 10/07/2003,I like it,4,"This car is perfect for me. More then 
enough passing power. I don't even 
have problems passing at speeds of 80 
mph (in the 4 cylinder) roomy enough 
to sit 2 adults and one child in 
comfort in the back of  the 2 door. I 
get roughly 380 to 395 miles per tank. 
The engine is quiet and strong. Great 
car in bad weather to. The snow strom 
of 2002 did't even stop me."
pontiac,grand-am,2002,JNiz3, 02/12/2005,Solid car,4,"I ended up buying my '02 GT1 sedan for a fair price with very low mileage.  I love how quick it takes off, whether off the line, but more so on the expressway.  I have had a few sensor problems (the Body Control Module [bcm]) died within the first year I had it; luckily I had it under the bumper- to-bumper warranty.  The monsoon speaker system is decent, but for an audiophile like myself, it doesn't cut it.  I love the looks of this car, specially the sunroof and deep grey interior.  The breaks squeak all the time when it's cold/wet; the only other thing is I wish it was slightly heavier to handle better in the winter.  I do enjoy driving my car though - it's quick, and handles GREAT!"

your fuel efficient at the same time. 
While there are aftermarket parts

this car. Not only for guys a good 
chick car also. its got a powerfull V6

its very comfortable interior is styled 
for everyone."

ability.  Great for cruising down the 
highway; I put 3900km on mine the first 
4 days I had it, including 12-hours of 
driving each on the first and last 
day.  Ride was comfortable and relaxing.
The ABS breaks work great and quieter 
than in ABS systems I've seen in older 
cars.  Got the Monsoon stero system and 
quite enjoy it.  It can really crank 
out the music. Its first winter it sat 
in a parking lot all day at sometimes -
28C weather and always started like a 
charm."

When you are going about 70mph , you can touch the gas pedal and feel the torque lift the front up a little! Wow. The ride is comfortably firm and it handles flat. I enjoy driving my car , and getting looks because I keep it very clean! This car isn't a Cadillac but it is easy to go faster than you think and the cabin is fairly hushed! Raced a 2005 Dodge Stratus R/T and a tuned 04 Nissan Sentra on the highway , they got blown away! Good job Pontiac!"
pontiac,grand-am,2002,mityhid, 02/14/2004,2002 Pontiac Grand AM GT,4,"The Grand AM overall is a very nice 
car.  Other than brake rotors needing 
to be resurfaced at 41000 miles, and 
the fuel pump at 47000 miles, I have 
had no problems mechanically with the 
car.  The fuel mileage is somewhat less 
than expected, I generally average 
about 20-24mpg.  I have gotten 31mpg on 
a freeway stretch, but I have never 
seen mileage that high again."

Gave up car back to father. Overall it's performance was very good. However the brakes were replaced a 2nd time within a month of 1st replacement. When it was replaced 2nd time, both front calipers, front rotar's, new brake fluid, & new brake fluid lines. (About $600 between both repairs. Brake pads were under warrentry from first repair). After all that was taken car of, It was very reliable and safe. My mechanic found the car's calipers & tie rods to be defective original parts. Hard to believe the car has great quality sound for a stock sound system."

seems as if the engine is working too 
hard to pull the weight and it will 
pass everything but a gas station.  It 
should only be offered in a 6-cylinder,

cost effective in the longrun."

to have the intake gasket replaced 2 
times with only 20,000 miles on the 
car, then the blinker stayed on and 
when I took it to the dealer they said

The car has been in the shop more times than I can count.  I believe it is in the shop more than it is in my driveway.  One instance was that the trunk lid would not close properly. Their answer was ""all the '02 trunk lids close that way"".  So they bring another car in and sure enough!  This car was poorly engineered from the ground up.  In fact I am on my way to get a new one.  Save yourself the trouble and buy a honda or a toyota!"

(Except for front brakes only last about 25000 before needing replacement).  At approx. 60000 miles the ignition module needed replaced ($200) then about 50 miles later it required a front hub assembly and an O2 sensor ($550).  Approx. 100 miles later the timing chain failed (while idling at a stop light) which caused valve damage ($1900).  About 75 miles after that problem the SES light is once again on and I'm sure that will result in once again many $$$ being spent on this car.  It is not abused and it is maintained properly.  Service is done by Pontiac dealership.  Unreliable Lemon!"

Since then I have had to replace 2 wheel bearings and the brakes squeak since they've been changed.

I was impressed. It handled very well and had more than enough power. I turned off the traction control and could easily spin the meaty P225/50R16's. Most importantly, it has awesome stopping power. I thought I wanted a stick shift like my last car, but after driving this car it's clear that the automatic is a perfect match, so I lost the desire to row my own gears. The cockpit layout is very logical. I was quite impressed with the stereo system. Don't be fooled by the horsepower rating; this car has more than enough power. A great car for real drivers."

pontiac,grand-am,2002,Former Owner, 12/01/2006,Finally Rid of It!!!!,3,"I just traded my Grand AM in this week.  I had to replace the brakes within a month of the warranty expiring.  The driver's power window conked out at 20,000 miles, luckily was covered by the warranty.  At 40,000 miles the AC quit.  This would have been a $1,400 repair bill, so I just suffered the heat in the summer. ( I live in the Northeast where it's cold most of the year, so I was able to live with that).  More recently, the radiator needed a $500 repair and 2 weeks ago the catalytic converter went out. Other minor things like leaks of fluid started.  Including the AC, I had about $3,000 worth of repairs to make.  with only 65,000 miles on it.  Never again General Motors!!!"

The catalytic converter clogged, the O2 senser went, the brakes still have some problem that causes the pads to have to be replaced every 2,000 miles. The timing chain broke, resulting in $1500.00 new engine, the front end needs work, and there is a mysterious electrical problem that is causing power surges and results in the car stall when I idle in drive.

This is a great alternative for me. I get great gas mileage, which is important these days. I only spend about $40 a month in gas.

just as comfortable and in my opinion 
just as well built as my Mercedes. I 
have put just over 11000 miles on it - 
and have pushed the little v6 and the 
cars abilities as far as I would dare - 
and found that performance and handling

pontiac,grand-am,2002,Snowflow, 01/07/2018,Regret trading this car in...,4,"I got a 2002 Grand Am GT coupe with about 60k when it was 10 years old and sold it last spring with about 120k. If I’m being honest I miss the car. For starters the car was very nice looking and the paint was in excellent shape with no fading, chipping or peeling (on the metal and plastic molding). The steering had a very nice feel to it and the car was easy to drive from slow to fast speeds and the ride was fairly smooth. The car had enough power to get off the line and merge quickly without worry. The interior could’ve been designed and pieces together better (lots of uneven gaps), but for the most part it was very durable and cleaned up nicely. The inside was roomy and the car felt very open especially with the sunroof. Now the reason I got rid of the car is I got tired of fixing the same stuff... over and over. Once the car hit 110k+ the front wheel bearings went (multiple times), both brake calipers went and the front driver one went multiple times, the mounting brackets on the new calipers caused the brake pads to slide very frequently, the car started to burn oil and then leak oil too. Basically I got rid of the car because the replacement parts are a joke and GM clearly isn’t standing behind the quality of their service centers. That much being said, I like the look and driving characteristics of the Grand Am more than the Impreza I replaced it with (believe it or not)... Grand Am had better steering feel, more power and looked cooler.

pontiac,grand-am,2003,Mo-mobile, 05/30/2003,Nice Car,5,"I love to drive this car! Definitely 
the best handling in its class! I was 
a little hesitant to buy a car with an 
automatic transmission but I quickly 
found the shifts to be very quick and 
firm. The engine produces enough power 
to make acceleration exciting and an 
exhaust note that makes me feel all 
warm and fuzzy inside.  The exterior 
styling is quite nice (I'm always 
afraid someone's going to steal my 
rims they're so nice) and the interior 
isn't bad either.  The seats are 
great, they're comfortable and 
supportive during spirited cornering.

want to stop driving."

There is more then the rated horsepower available, especially considering the cars 3800 lbs. and it runs great!! I would advise i bought this NOT looking for a maintenance free car - it waas cherry but i replaced the coolant with NON DEX_COOL and a lower-tem thermostat - its a GM thing you need to correct but the engine will last foever - i'm a mechanic and trust me it will save you TONS of trouble. I've seen GM's like this take some serious abuse and keep on going!!! "
pontiac,grand-am,2003,whiteside1013, 08/28/2013,"Good first car, lots of problems.",3,"This car is a good first car, but not much more than that. I purchased it from my older brother, who owned it for about 2 years. Before him, it was owned by a family friend and before that a car rental service, so my car has seen its fair share of abuse. When my brother bought the car, it had a leak in the cooling system to where it had to be filled every week or so. It was too expensive to fix, so I've been living with it. The driver side windows have been broken twice. The oil switch broke, which almost totaled the car. The starter went out. The washer pump is broken. The horn is broken. The dashboard is warping up. The keyless entry system is broke"
pontiac,grand-am,2003,Ashley, 06/21/2010,Mistake!,2,"ONE owner. I bought new 10/2002 happy to have a new car. Headliner fell down 5X in the first 6 mos, then brake pads (every 4 mos & a few calipers) Owner of 5 cars in my life, ONLY 1 has done this, hmm?? Driver, doubt it. Then 2007 big ticket repairs, Dex-Cool ruined hoses, gaskets, manifolds THEN I find out about the Class Action Lawsuit too late to file my repairs. Also replaced many other parts. Do I go on? Not only did I pay of $24K new I have about $8K in repairs. Sell? find out about GM's extreme depreciation, I could not get this nightmare off my hands! 2010 with a 155K mi & needs 3K more in repairs to run, I can't give this car away at this point! Buy a GM, NEVER AGAIN!"
pontiac,grand-am,2003,Chris A., 12/11/2018,Best purchase I've made,5,"I bought this car 11yrs ago with 68k miles on it.  It now has 208k and going strong!  All it ever needs is preventative maintenance, tires and brakes.  Biggest thing I had to do was a thermostat and some coolant lines.  Lights are on the dash but the reader shows no codes.  I think it's just old electrical issue as a lot of GM's have after a decade.  I have been very blessed with this car.  I will stay with her until she dies which I don't think will be soon. I think I can get 250-300k miles out of it. If you have a chance to pick one up under 80k miles don't hesitate.  It will last you with proper maintenance.

Was a great ride and reliable for the better of 4 years. Now six years out, the car is falling apart. Pads and rotors seem to be replaced often.Surprising since I don't race the car, and it is used as a daily commuter with 114,000 miles on it. Replaced ignition switch, emergency brake (broke after replacement by dealer, they had never seen that before), head gasket, and now putting off drivetrain and suspension repair. Tell myself everyday, ""Why did I ever buy this car?"" GM vehicles seem to have become the money pit of car ownership in my experience. I say buy foreign for better quality!"

Even winding up nose first in a snow bank on the side of the highway didn't stop it. Aside from minor wear and tear work, we've never had to replace anything major, even with it being our only car for 4+ years, surviving all those New England winters.

The title offers more than the engine itself. 8+ seconds to 60 which can be an issue passing sometimes, however it has a ton of torque. Other than that it's a fun car with decent fuel economy.

Paint has literally been flying off the bumpers and the doors as i drive At 70,000 Km my air conditioning quit and some type of relay switch in the blinker has gone when I turn the clicking noise of the blinker keeps going for 45-60 seconds after the turn is completed. The fog lamps in the front tend to come loose and point in strange directions I have used Duct tape to hold them in place When called the dealer and told them of my concerns she said Oh they are prone to those problems but bring it in Pay for an Inspection"
pontiac,grand-am,2003,rumrunner83, 01/04/2013,"Not a bad car considering, but not great.",4,"I bought my Grand AM SE 2.2L brand new in November of 2002.
I still have the car just over ten years now.
Its a sporty car with a particularly powerful four cylinder engine.
That being said, it is a four cylinder, and while the car is absolutely fantastic for highway driving, the car is simply too heavy for hills and cold weather.
Even when the car was new it did not like climbing hills, and in the cold the engine loses significant horsepower.
However, the car is amazing on gas if properly maintained and I have driven from southern Massachusetts to Bangor, Maine (Approximately 300 miles) before refueling."

Had a good amount of power with the 3.4Ltr 6cyl.
Gas mileage was amazing!
I live in Wyoming and they both got around in the snow VERY well.
Never had any trouble with either one, I have since upgraded to an SUV, but I do miss those cars.

I've always had maintenance done on time, cleaned it often, and simply took greater care of it than others found reasonable. It still keeps up with my lead foot, is still running and looking like new after three fairly serious accidents, drove smoothly between California and Massachusetts four times, and its fun-to-drive rating becomes ""10"" with the right custom suspension and engine upgrades.

liter is far too anemic for the GT's

standing start is OK, but it quickly 
runs out of breath. This engine is, 
however, very smooth and reliable. Ride

I have to take it in again because my power steering fluid is leaking and the wheel is making a grinding noise. I have taken it back 3 times for GM to fix the back door, it rattles.

Seen many of the typical problems-replace front brakes every 15k, passlock issues, random clicking, leaking intake manifold gasket, etc. When I complained about the front brake servicing to Pontiac corporate, they were minimally helpful. Researching a bit, I found numerous consumer complaints, and several Tech Service Bulletins issues by Pontiac regarding the brakes. One additional item:(might vary by state) in MA, the GAGT is very expensive to insure-same as a BMW, due to repair cost. Many of the negative aspects of the car seem to be related to a corporate philosophy from GM, which with the recent bailout requests seem to run deeper than just the GAGT"

I lived on a very steep hill and my neighbors could not get up the hill in the snow but my Pontiac went right up the hill.  This car looks nice,I like how it looks sporty. Handles well,gets good gas mileage. I always thought it was pretty roomy until a car seat would not really fit well in the back seat. Stroller also takes up the entire trunk.  I have only had to repair the fuel pump and that was at 125,000 miles. All other work on the car has been just routine maintenance. My only complaint would be that it's little noisy inside"

They could make money on selling cars. Brakes - were bad from fac. they didn't even clean the disks ( still greasy) ; Pass lock may have worked it they lubricated the cylinder: Water pump - they put this on the timing chain- Very bad design!

It hasn't had any problems except last week the fuel pump went out which for your information is really common for Pontiac Grand Am's Chevy Malibu's of 99-03 and Olds-mobile Alero's it's just a chronic problem just like nissan's and brake failure anyway my dads slammed the car into a curb going 40 in ice and nothing happened to it didn't even get out of alignment tell me one car that does that i could keep going on but i don't have enough space but for quality and performance this is the best car.

I haven't had any major problems with it, however, certain things have started to go and with the Grand Am's, it's the little things that kill you. A few months after I bought it my stereo light dimmed and it's hard to see. The seal on my passenger's side door is loose so when it rains heavy my entire passenger's side floor is soaked. My air only works on 3 and above. Now my driver's side window is expendable and refuses to work sometimes.  If you live in the Midwest please make sure you have another vehicle for winter.

Which gleams beautifully when the sun 
hits it. I got the ""Moonsoon"" sound 
system which I highly reccomend,the 
best stock sound system I have ever 
heard. The 6 cylinder isvery quick,and 
with the ""Ram Air"" I got plus I put a 
K&N perfomance air filter in,it has 
about 200 horse power,and I have timed 
my car zero-60 in about 7.5 seconds! 
Good horse power for a V-6,I can 
remeber years ago when V-8's had 200 
horse power. Over all a great car,I 
give it a 10!!"

are great.....My new car has satelite

and back passengers.  Nice style in and 
out.  The V6 is good, but better yet 
with a little bit of tinkering with the 
intakes and exhaust.  The only gripe 
most Grand AM GT owners have is the 
fact that GM decided to put a 4T45 
transmission.  The GT simply needs 
more.  A manual would be nice too."

a few problems with the 
suspension ""popping"" when turning or 
going over bumps.  Uppon taking it to 
the dealership I was informed that it 
was just body ""creaks"", and nothing 
could be done to repair problem.  It 
was sad to be told that I spent $22,000 
on a car that creaks.  Engine 
continually revs when cold, even for 20 
min or more untill it reaches 200 
degrees, seariously cuts mpg."

for everyday needs with some fun on the 
side.  The 3400 SFI is a great engine 
and very reliable. The pricing of Grand 
Ams seems to be creeping upwards, but 
then, it is worth it in my opinion 
rather than to be driving an Accord 
with 100 million other people."

small. I traded in a 2003 Corolla for 
this grand am. The best part is the 
smooth pickup with enough power to 
move out quick if necessary.  It is a 
little too noisy . seems I have to 
turn the radio up there is so much 
background noise in the car.  and the 
radio dosn't seem to have good 
acoustics.  Gas milage is 25-28.   am 
happy with this car.  I owned a

governers on the car, They govern 
Redlining, Top speed, slip shifting on 
an automatic. No problem, But why does 
the governer turn off the engine at 106 
mph? I normally don't travel at those 
speeds, but when I took it to the 
track, It wouldn't perform past 106 
mph. Someone owes me money or an 
explanation, I lost to a 4cyl stick 
Grand Am, I beat him off the line and 
in the 1/4 mile but when we went on the 
oval track I lost. He was able to reach 
120mph now how is that fair? Rear 
Seats, ok now why can't I gain access 
to my trunk from within the car? The 
old Grand Am's were able to. "
pontiac,grand-am,2003,mlinde, 08/11/2003,Compared with my old '96 GAGT,4,"Noticeable performance increase over 
my '96 GAGT (which had a 3.1). Holds a 
straight line considerably better at 
cruising speed with crosswind. Better 
braking due to all around disk brakes. 
Hugs corners with less leaning than 
my '96. Monsoon sound definately better 
than my '96."
pontiac,grand-am,2003,gmforever, 07/19/2012,GREAT CAR have had 1 big problem,4,i love the car to death i really do. great car and it does get attention even without doing mods or anything major to it. i got the car back in SEPT 2011 as a birthday gift from me to myself. 1 month after i got the car the number 5 valve bolt popped out and we had to rethread the hole which was a pain.but ever since i have had nothing at all just minor problems. headlights were too fogged over couldnt even get it cleaned up enough to make them look good or even improve driving at night. so brought new ones and thats really it. if anyone has had this problem tho please POST because seems im the only one so far with it thanks
pontiac,grand-am,2003,Stupid, 09/18/2003,GranDAMNED,2," GrandAM is a nightmare to drive on 
wet and uneven road surfaces.
The vehicle has a tendency to push on 
left turns and sometimes delivers an 
abrupt swerve when turning to the left 
on dry roads.  This condition almost 
caused an accident on the PA Turnpike.

GM dealer's repsonse was the 
typical ""couldn't duplicate condition"" 
but refuses to remove the McPherson 
struts for thorough examination.  

What ever happened to the old reliable 
GM Corporation?  As a diehard GM fan I 
am now looking to imports as 
replacement.  Never thought I would 
see this day!"

pontiac,grand-am,2003,nene, 12/05/2004,It's okay,3,"I have had my G.A. for almost a year. Not too crazy about it. Every time a hit a bump or tracks, I think it is going to fall apart (rough ride). The seals around the windshield, and the back window are peeling off. I have had my radio replaced twice, for excessive skipping. It still skips. There is a leak somewhere on the driver side, so, I am forever thinking the door is not closed all of the way. The front seat is really cramped when there's a rear facing car seat behind it. I don't recommend the G.A. as a family car. I do, however, like all of the cup holders and the storage space. I was also looking into buying the Taurus. The Taurus was really generic, compared to the G.A.   "

pontiac,grand-am,2003,Ben, 06/09/2005,Brakes and Rotors,4,"The quality of this car is highly unacceptable to me.  Within the first 44,000 miles, this car has gone through 3 sets of rotors and three sets of brakes.  GM considers rotors a ""wear item.""  If you have not replaced your front rotors and your mileage is above 20,000 miles, prepare to replace them soon.  This car performs great, is comfortable, and is very fun to drive.  If GM could produce quality rotors, this would be the perfect car."

sufficient for me so far.  I like the 
Monsoon sound system, along with the 
MP3 capability.  However, the overall 
stlying of the car hasn't changed much 
in several years, and some of the 
structural design seems somewhat 
cheap.  I take very good care of

about 4 months is already showing some

leaking. Again - all fixed with a smile.

At 32,900 miles, the lower intake

The bolts that hold the system together work loose over time, causing the intake manifold gasket to come apart and engine coolant to leak out. This is a known problem with GM 3.1 and 3.4 liter engines, yet GM refuses to design a new intact system to correct this issue. It is a somewhat expensive repair ($700 to $800). Fortunately, mine was covered under warranty. So owners beware!!! If you see or smell engine coolant, you  have an idea of what your repair most likely will be. Aside from this problem, car is great!"

My windows are off track and pontiac said they fixed when they didnt they have done this about 4 times and I just dont feel like going car less for a day again.

I love the exterior design especially with the SC/T package. Mine is one of the few bright red SC/T coupes and it always gets attention whenever I take it out. Since this is my daily driver (I have a 100 mile/day commute to work) interior comfort was a must, and my GAGT doesn't disappoint. So far with 41k miles (bought it with 17.5K) the only thing to go wrong was the blower motor resistor, a typical problem for the 99+ GAs.

Needless to say after 6500 in repair (much more than i can get on trade) i will not be going with another Pontiac ever. "
pontiac,grand-am,2003,n wiebe, 03/26/2007,Not too bad,4,"The car captured me right away. The car handles like the pros. I can corner with absolute confidence regardless of my speed. Acceleration is not bad, but you will suck the gas back if you enjoy using the gas pedal. Sound system is quite good. I found the bass to be somewhat lacking, but a small subwoofer solved that. The doors are awfully wide when trying to park. Would love to have vertical door kit installed for that. Front wheel bearing have gone, blinker relay went crazy, had a bit too much shavings in the tranny when I changed filter and oil, doors don't seal well in cross winds, factory rims peeling(so much for chrome). Other than that, has been fine."
pontiac,grand-am,2003,Mark, 08/01/2007,Fun little car,4,I have had it going on 4 years now. Only thing replaced has been the battery. No problems except with some clunk noise in the front suspension. Either has gone away or don't notice it anymore.

great in any occasion. I don't have any

any, i have the quad four engine which 
is really good. i don't know about the 
automatic transmission but i know that 
the manual transmission is really good 
and i don't need a V6 to get power, the 
quad four is good enough and i like

pontiac,grand-am,2003,lilseany, 10/31/2007,"Good at first, but it all went downhill",3,"I bought this car with 27,000 miles on it one year old.  It started out as a smooth ride with a lot of power.  After one year I had to completely replace the brakes.  After hiting the 70,000 mile mark, I've had to replace the alternator (very expensive for this car) and the fuel pump (also pricey).  The car is constantly having some sort of electrical problem and sometimes it just doesn't want to start and has to have the computer reset.  It has left me stranded too many times.  I can't wait to trade it in!!! I should've listened to the guy who stopped me at a gas station and warned me that these cars fall apart after 60,000 miles "
pontiac,grand-am,2003,Bond007, 05/13/2003,Awesome,5,"The Pontiac Grand AM GT that I 
purchased has been running great since 
day one.  The smooth and powerfull 3.4 
liter V6 engine with Ram Air feature 
makes the car one of the fastest cars 
in its comparison group.  The interior 
is clean and modern with features like 
a monsoon stereo system and leather 
apolstery.  I firmly believe in 
supporting America, so by buying an 
American made car I believe I have 
accomplished this.  I recomend this

Pontiac has get-up-and-go.  This car 
has more punch and better handling than 
an comparably priced Accord.  However, 
I can't compare the reliably, nor would 
anyone be surprised if I did.

Unlike their counterparts at Ford, GM 
remains a solid ""B"" student.  They 
build solid cars at reasonable prices.  
Now if we can just discuss the over-
stylized interiors.  (It's a car, not

Very good on gas; get 31 mpg on highway. Seats are comfortable for long trips too. Engine is peppy and spirited with the 5-speed, which is more in keeping with Pontiac's history. The engine, however, is a little growly (quieter on my Escape). Car is very reliable and have no leaks or major issues. My car has had two issues other owners have complained about: Turn signal stalk needed replacing because it would click after turn, and seams on bottom of all doors needed to be sealed and painted because of rust. Interior build quality not as good as newer GM vehicles. Overall, a good car for less money."

Especially when it is cold outside. I've had to replace both front hubs, a cv joint, the fuel pump, an ignition control module, and on 3 separate occasions, have had 3 rocker arms come loose on the rear head (by loose I mean they were lying on top of the head when I opened the valve cover). I've replaced the brakes and rotors twice since I bought the car and have to do them again soon due to warped rotors. I do not intend to buy another grand am. Ever. And I do not recommend anyone else buying one. Unless they like to work on vehicles a lot. "

Has never failed to start and has the original battery (04) in it. Don't blame the manufacturer if you bought a used car and it isn't up to par---maintain it!

This car has excellent traction in the winter time.  The engine performs astonishingly well when floored.  The Monsoon sound system is of very good quality and if you're not a fan of traction control (as I am not), you can turn it off with the push of a button.  Although my car is now 14 years old is just barely over 82,000 miles, it is the best I could ever expect in a used sports coupe.

pontiac,grand-am,2004,Grand AM GT for me!, 12/04/2010,Maintain your car - No problems!!!!,5,"I am sitting here laughing my backside off at all the complaints. All but a few are due to lack of maintaince, just plain ignorance in taking care of a car, and the attitude ""if it ain't broke don't fix it""! For instance the clicking in the dash is nothing but cleaning the turn signal wires on the blinker control. I bought my 2004 Grand Am Gt, loaded, used, with 57000 miles on it. It had everything original even the tires. I am still driving it as I bought it cause someone took great care of it and maintained it as any intelligent will do. Get off your backside ""crybabies"" and read the manual or can't you read???? Great car, no proglems! Always blame someone else for your troubles!! Duh!"

Motor mount snapped at 155,000 and we had to replace the water pump as well. Signals stopped working right at 175, and wheel bearings need to be replaced soon. Original battery lasted until 120. The mirrors stick out a bit too far. I've lost three. Eventually got ones that fold in. Overall a fantastic car and so much fun to drive. This was my first car; I think it says a lot about the car that it still performs so well after so being driven around so much by a young, inexperienced driver. A big disappointment they stopped making them so long ago; looks like my next car will be a G6."

So far the gas mileage has been great (25+ mpg)and there is enough power in that LA1 V6 to keep me in the fast lane without getting pulled over.  I read some reviews about horrible gas mileage, but their favorite features are SPEED?!? Dumb. If you overdrive any car, after a while it will lose mileage. Stick with AC Delco replacement plugs/filters/wires/etc. and change them at regular intervals. This car will keep you going for well over 100K miles.  The LA1 3.4-liter V6 is the most refined, American-built 60° since the 2.8-liter was introduced in the '80s. Great engine."

Up until this week, i've never had a problem until the climate control went out.
Turns out that I blew out the blower motor, and blower motor resistor, along with the circuit breaker.
It was about an $800.00 repair which isn't bad considering how many miles were on the car.

My gas mileage is 24 mpg (both city and highway miles) while my old car (a 4cyl.) was only getting 27. I also love how the radio stays on after you take the keys out. Before I get out of the car I leave the cd playing my favorite song and eight hours later I turn on my car to find my favorite song. I just got a chance to drive it in the snow and it handled really well. I was worried because i hate antilock brakes in snowy weather.

For a cheep everyday driver it is fast and fun all while using regular gas and not hurting my bank. One thing that i found to be great is that there is actually a community around this car and entire website devoted to custom grand am. just google custom grand am and you will find it. i love my grand am. not to mention the car has held its value greatly i paid $1,700 for mine and found that in its condition i could sell it for up to $2,500 after just fixing a few things and owning it for 3 whole years.

pontiac,grand-am,2004,Tj Keen, 10/27/2016,Great first car!!!,5,"I bought a 04 Grand Am GT1 Coupe a few months ago, and so far besides a few issues it has been very reliable for me. I bought it with just over 100,000 miles, and the fuel pump went around 103,000 miles but $250 I think it was isn't bad. Now at almost 105,000 I had to get the ignition switch changed because the car wouldn't turn over a couple times. All in all I love this car, I've always wanted one of these since I was a kid lol. It is a blast to drive I haven't driven it in the winter yet obviously but hopefully it is as good as people are saying it is. The one thing that kind of bugs me is the turn signal ticking when I'm not using it. But that doesn't bother me as much because I either have the radio turned up or the windows/sunroof open or both. I do also love the fact I have Sirius XM as well. I can now listen to hard rock music besides just alternative crap around here by Chicago. But overall I'd recommend this car for any first experience drivers who are looking for a affordable sports car.

pontiac,grand-am,2004,Courtney, 04/12/2005,This car is a step behind the rest,3,"This is my 1st Pontiac that I traded my Nissan Altima for, big mistake!  My Altima drove like a luxory vehicle, this thing is so loud and rough riding.  You can hear everything that is going on outside of the car, especially freeway traffic.  The inside is pretty basic compared to other sedans in its class (honda, nissan, toyota...)  Its getting left in the dust  by other competitor's styles.  "
pontiac,grand-am,2004,AJGierer, 10/08/2004,they seem nice until you own one.,3,"i enjoyed this car until stuff starting 
breaking for no reason. like the strut 
broke and broke the spring and ripped 
up the tire, at 50000 miles. then at 
about 51000 the power steering pump and 
pressure hose behind it broke. not only 
that but that parts for GM cost an arm 
and a leg and the labor for this poorly 
desigened cars is a killer too. as i 
said i liked this car until i had to do 
repairs on things that should not of 
broke or the expensive labor costs."
pontiac,grand-am,2004,Judith Chesnick, 07/02/2007,Driving Excitement,5,"I enjoy having and driving it very much. It handles excellent and the ride is very smooth. I haven't had any complaints from people who have rode in it with me. I actually underestimated it when I looked at it but when I drove it, man it drove like a soaring eagle. The color of this car is nice, it is greystone metallic. It is a subtle color for the power that this car possesses. But I am not complaining.  "

A wealthy friend of mine put it best...""You need not be rich to afford a BMW, but the opposite is true about owning a domestic"".  -Buy something well built and you wont break yourself in repairs.  I'm sorry but we did it to ourselves, America.  We lost the zero defect mentality and embraced the quick buck slap it together and send it out the door philosophy."
pontiac,grand-am,2004,mike_65_, 07/07/2008,Love this car!,5,Bought this car a month ago and really am pleased with it. It handles much better then the 1997 Chev Lumina I had. It is fun to drive and is very good on gas and has great pep for a 2.2L. I get lots of compliments on the styling of the car. The graystone metallic is just my color. 
pontiac,grand-am,2004,thatsudduthgirl, 08/13/2008,Need to fix that security light issue!,3,"I love my car, but lately, if I turn off the car to run into the store (example), I have to leave the key turned on for 10 MINUTES to get that stupid light to go out so I won't be late for work!!  This is ridiculous! I have already planned to start leaving earlier for work, as I have kids to drop off and errands to run.  Too costly to have it fixed and the gas mileage SUX!!!"
pontiac,grand-am,2004,prettybuez28, 12/28/2008,Fun to drive but some issues,4,"I purchased this car in July of 07'. Loved it when I laid eyes on it. I have had some issues as far as repairs go. An ignition control sensor went out 1 month after I bought it. That was about $500.  About 2 months later had the wheel berring and traction control sensor go in the left front, that was about $300.  And the last thing was kind of expected with 65,000 miles about 1 year later. Had a fuel pump go out. That cost about $500. All those things were just basic maintaince but still expensive. Other then those things my car has been a great car and expensive on gas with the higher prices."

I have added some things to the car in which if ur like me and want more horsepower and torque you can easliy get if u replace certain parts like instead of having that ram air i replaced that with a cold air intake to add some horsepower which it did and i have also added many other parts which if u have the money you could do and my i also add this car sounds great with a pair of 12' subs"
pontiac,grand-am,2004,GrandAmmer, 03/28/2009,2004 Grand Am SE1,4,"Bought this car with 21K miles in good condition. Had to replace front brakes at 40k miles and front wheel bearings at 51K miles. I have now found out that these are common issues with Grand Ams. Car has been reliable running and decent on mileage. But resale value drops quickly. There are some shortcuts in this car, like no dipstick for transmission fluid level. Fog lights are for appearance only and are totally ineffective in actual fog. Not a bad car for the low price, but expect to pay for additional maintenance if you keep car for a few years."
pontiac,grand-am,2004,Scott, 03/27/2009,Bad fuel economy,3,"Nice car but can, t seem to get more than 250 km on a tank of fuel ( city driving in cold winter ) maybe summer will be better. Even took it in to get looked at and apparently there is nothing wrong. Once again bad fuel economy. Bought a lemon."
pontiac,grand-am,2004,Jolena911, 12/31/2007,Good Transportation,3,"This is a reliable car and I still like the body styling. The styling makes it look kind of hot, but with the 2.2 four, it can't really do anything performance wise. The interior is one of GM's (unrotunate) specialties: hideous hard plastics in dank colors. The dash is really ugly with two hard plastic lumps that I suppose are supposed to resemble an airplane cockpit??? The GAm's interior is so bad that I rode in a friend's Corrolla and thought I was in a Bentley.  On the other hand, the GAm is extremely reliable.  I've only had to do regular maintence.  No breakdowns and no nagging problems at all.  This car is good transportation, but it's market value is weak."
pontiac,grand-am,2004,ROBERT, 06/07/2009,Best car that I have owned,4,I love my Pontiac Grand Am its too bad that there not going to make any more Pontiacs. The car gets great gas mileage and it is very peppy especially when your passing someone on a two lane road. What I dont like about it it has to many cup holders and the rear cup holder that folds out you cannot place any cup in the holder without it spilling onto the floor.  
pontiac,grand-am,2004,Judith, 01/21/2008,Driving Excitement,4,I had purchased this vehicle in October 2006.  I traded in my 1996 Pontiac Grand Am gt for it.  I walked into the showroom and I fell in love with this car when I laid my eyes on it.  It looks and drives awesomely.  It hauls.  People have underestimated this car until I have proved it.  
pontiac,grand-am,2004,Vanessa, 08/21/2009,Almost Five years of Fun,4,"I am still enjoying my car, I love the pick up on the open freeway. The CD player went out a very long time ago. All of the repairs I have had were minor such as radiator, waterpump.. when I first got the car I had problems with the sensory switch (or security light) but that was fixed under the warranty and it never happened again. When I sell my car next year (to up grade) someone will be getting a heck of a deal.."
pontiac,grand-am,2004,Doe, 09/22/2009,Best purchase I made.,5,"I happened to walk onto a car lot just browsing and laid eyes on this car and had to have it immediately. It was used with 80k miles for 7000 dollars at the time. I grabbed the car up, since then I added a K&N air filter and new 17' rims and low profile tires and omg yes 2 12' subs in the trunk. Awesome Car. I love the way the car handles and feels while driving it. Working on dual exhaust and a new paint job because white isn't my style, but over all that car is hot. No mechanical problems and I keep maintenance up on the car. "
pontiac,grand-am,2004,joshchevy4, 09/30/2009,Poorly made car to say the least,1,"I had bought this car used in '05 and am the first real owner as it was a rental car prior to my purchase. For a kid I put quite a few miles on it, came with 28,000 and now it has 93,000. Brakes were a huge problem, replaced them and front rotors a couple times. Caliper went out, wheel bearing went out, and now I've been facing these electrical problems which eventually led to the passing of this car. No dash lights, smoking from the dash area, no brake lights, and now the fuel pump is shot. Interior falls apart each time i sneeze, and I've had nothing but the worst experiences with it (excluding the time I topped out at 120). Do yourselves a favor and buy a Honda, Toyota, or Mitsubishi."
pontiac,grand-am,2004,Lindsay03, 10/27/2009,Great First Car!,4,"This is my very first car, and I'm still loving every bit of it. Though we've had to change the front brakes once at about 84000 miles and just replace the signal flasher (?), which was only about $150 (But that was doing the labor from my dad). Even though it has only about a 12 gallon tank, it still gets fairly good gas mileage. I figure I got about 19 to the gallon...could be worse. "
pontiac,grand-am,2004,Melissa, 11/11/2009,Good First Car,3,"First car ever. While I mourn the lack of power windows, the car itself isn't all that bad. Has quite a bit of zoom for a 4cyl, with excellent freeway acceleration. Also, good gas mileage. I've done 400 miles on a tank. I've made a few boo-boos, and drove for over a year without the passenger side mirror, as well as crunched a few fenders. However, this car has a horrid side crash safety rating, which occasionally gives me nightmares. On the whole, it makes a good first car, since it's fairly cheap but has some power."
pontiac,grand-am,2004,Edie, 12/03/2009,STINKS ON GAS!!!!,3,I don't know if anyone else has this issue but this car all of a sudden is getting bad gas mileage.  Was getting around 32mpg before but now I'm lucky if I get 14mpg. Have had other issues too and the car is only 4 years old.  Will not buy a Pontiac again.
pontiac,grand-am,2004,Barry09, 01/19/2010,Boooo,4,"Fuel pump went out atleast 4 times within first two months of owning car, constant, constant, constant ticking in dash, AIRBAGS DID NOT GO OFF in wreck when rear ending someone at 35 mph, coolant leaked constantly, tires leaked in cold weather, keyfab did not work, lots of problems. I would not suggest this car to ANYONE."

My first car ever was 93 - SE, my second car was a 95 - GT and my third car is my 04 GT.  It's got enough getup to keep me happy, but it keeps me out of trouble.  I have a race car for that."
pontiac,grand-am,2004,chad, 03/02/2010,Good but not great,3,I bought my grand am gt 2 months ago and love it for the most part.  It really runs well and has a thrill factor to it.  I would like a little more power though.  The ram air is a joke and im looking into cold air intake.  Car guzzles gas like a v-8.  It is important not to run cheap gas in these cars as your performance will suffer.  Dont get me wrong i love th  e car but pontiac cant seem to get enough power out of a 6- cylinder engine.  Should be faster than it is. Any model but the gt is a waste of money. 
pontiac,grand-am,2004,lovehatesit, 09/18/2012,Looks over quality,3,"I purchased this vehicle back in '07 it was working perfect up until about a year of having it all was well until I noticed some things going out and as murphy's law fix one thing another breaks. hazard switch was the first, then the breaks, then the bearing, electrical issues, a/c, wont turn over on hot days, heat goes on smells like gas, and now my window motor. this car is a beauty....but on the in-inside its all falling apart and i cant afford another vehicle let alone the repair costs. Dont bother to get this car if you REALLY want one, you can buy mine $12k."

The security light flashes and I do the ""10 minutes, keep your key in the  ON position"" and it goes back to normal.  I did have to finally replace the pass lock cylinder which GM swears they are the only ones that can fix this.  $500 later it's fixed, but  its been 3 years and I am starting to have those probs again!

pontiac,grand-am,2004,GM man, 11/21/2010,Not Half Bad,3,"I was forced to buy this car as the result of a divorce.  Other than that bad taste fact the car has performed very well.  Purchased new in 2004 and now has 97K on it.  Have replaced battery, brakes, tires, front wheel bearing and the turn signal switch.  Not to shabby if you ask me.  Have had a couple of interior pieces break in the last year but its cosmetic and easy to replace.  My son has inherited the car now and loves it.  Do your scheduled maintenance and most cars will serve you well.  I won't buy new again because I hate taking the hit when I want to change cars.  Buying used you have to be careful and have a mechanic you trust check it before you buy it.  Maintenance records great."
pontiac,grand-am,2004,rhalld38, 06/19/2014,I Really Enjoy This Car,3,"My 2004 Pontiac Grand Am I have had since 2005, and never had one major problem with it besides the blower motor kept going out on it and to replace it 3 times but I think it was because of where I got it from.
The car has over 107,000 miles on it and have drove it from Illinois and Michigan numerous times with no problems at all.
It drives great and looks great as well.
I have been in a couple fender benders but the car still holds up in appearance.
The only thing I do not like about this vehicle it has to many cup holders and the interior has to much plastic.
Other than that it has great gas mileage while on the highway in the city it is about average."
pontiac,grand-am,2004,tam10, 04/21/2011,Keep or Sell ???,4,"I wasn't sure if I wanted to keep my 2004 Pontiac Grand Am Gt but I LOVE IT & it's such a nice looking car I would hate to get rid of it & would certainly miss it.
Although since January all I did was start to replace things in it that have gone bad. First the rack in January then a good cleaning on the EGR sensor then last week front brakes,pads & routers then to top it all off on Saturday while moving a friend of mine the factory battery finally went after 7 yrs. Also the TRANSMISSION. OMG didn't know what to do at this point, pay the bank or pay 3000.00 to have the trans fixed, Well guess what I decided to do.
Everything is getting fixed & replaced.

pontiac,grand-am,2004,jonesm, 12/04/2003,Best Thing to Come From Detroit in Years,4,"Well, this is my second Grand Am of the 
same body style.  The first was lost in 
an unfortunate accident.  50MPH into a 
stationary object and all parties 
walked away.  I don't know what 
standards the IIHS uses, but clearly 
this is a safe vehicle.

With 170 horsepower, the V6 puts on a 
good show.  Plenty of power, but not 
too much.  Off the line, it's quick and 
the automatic is smooth. 

Interior leaves a little to be desired, 
but it's an American car, let's face 
it.  The controls are VERY easy to read.
 
The road manners on this car rival even 
the best Europe has to offer.  As a BMW

close.  "

This car is fun to drive and it feels solidly built.  My only complaints with the design is that the rear seating is a little tight for adults.  My only mechanical problems are a spring that broke in back of the drivers seat and that the fog lights stopped working.  Both of these are minor and I will have them fixed at my next oil change.  The engine has been smooth with not even a hint of any looming problems.  Do not purchase anything else until you try the Grand Am.

driving in 1978, and this is BY FAR the 
best (except maybe my first car, a '71 
VW Bug - but it was my first, c'mon!). 
It is flashy (fusion orange, to match 
my red hair!), sporty, a LOT of fun to 
drive, decent gas mileage, heavy and 
solid feeling (unlike foreign cars 
which always feel cheap to me), and an 
engine that feels and performs like an 
old muscle car (the throaty roar from 
the Ram Air is unbelievably 
exhilarating). It is a car that makes 
me smile every time I see it, and gives 
me a thrill every time I accelerate, 
all without making a big dent in my 
budget. It makes me feel like a 
teenager again!"
pontiac,grand-am,2004,mike in virginia, 11/08/2005,Fun car,4,This is the first I have owned and so far its been a great car. I like the g6 it just lacks in body style. My own opinion GM should have just revamped the grand AM a few more ponys under the hood wouldnt hurt. the 3400 is dependable but a super charged offer would be nice.  
pontiac,grand-am,2004,hank, 12/22/2005,Better Than Expected,3,"Never thought much of the Grand Am- basic trans. bought it for 50% off sticker price to share with my teenage son.

This is the first Grand Am we ever owned. Only had it for a month and so far its been great. Does have rattle in front-end, replaced the front bushings (recall campain on it.) Not sure what the other noise is, in shop having looked at. Over all performance is great. We have the SE1 with 3.4 V-6. Love this car. I would buy another. So far no major problems, just a little rattle in the front end. Gas mileage could be increased by a few tricks, but thats still coming! "

If I ever buy another Pontiac again, 
which is highly likely, I will again 
give Pontiac Master of Augusta the 
first chance to sell it to me.  It does 
not get good gas mileage at all, but it 
is a V6 so I didn't really think it 
would.  I love the interior design!  My 
baby's car seat fits perfectly in the 
back seat while leaving plenty of leg

Grand Prix, I found this car to be the 
best handling and the most fun to 
drive.  The pick-up speed for getting 
on the freeway is exceptional, as 
living in the Bay Area CA, that type of 
speed is needed at times.  Also the 
ride is extremely smooth even on the 
roughest road...Excellent buy"

plaguing these cars since their 
introduction have been worked out. I 
checked Japanese competitors, but 
there just werent enough discounts to 
buy those cars. My Grand Am is loaded 
at $24K--I drove it off the lot for 
well under $18K. Unfortunately, resale 
on the Grand Am is horrid. Wouldve 
been nice if it were offered with a 
manual transaxle, but I have to admit 
this auto shifts smooth. Compared to 
Chrysler, GM transaxles are a dream. 
Overall, Im VERY happy with my 
purchase. I havent owned a car that 
garnered so many looks, and was this 
fun to drive, since I sold my Fiero 
years ago."

satisfied with this car.  I have done 
30,000 miles on it without the

inside and out I found excellent.  
Acceleration was brisk but the only 
flaw was the Goodyear tires.  When I 
changed to Kumhow 712's the handling 
improved immensely as did the wet 
braking.  The Grand Am GT is one of the

13000 on the odomoter, she's now at 
22000+. Took her round trip 1400+ miles 
one time to Nevada from west Oregon. 
Lots of top speed action on the ""middle 
of nowhere"" roads. :-) Cornering is 
great. Stopping is great. Her only flaw 
would be wet weather traction. The 16's 
with the Goodyears need hot, dry 
pavement. But she's a good car. LTaken 
lots of coastal trips. Fun, reliable, 
attractive car. It easily beats most 
imports (i.e. wannabe racers) off the

However, It didn't quite do that for me after awhile, it was short-term. I became unimpress with the overall quality and performance.  The center console along with everything else in the interior feels extremely cheap.  The exterior is okay, the only thing that bothers me is the emptiness and gaps of the plastic moldings, it can really make the engine very dirty during the winter with salt and dirt which I notice when driving during this season.  Engine performance is acceptable, a lot of low end torque but it disappears at higher revs (no top end). After awhile, the car feels old =("

We would definitely recommend the V-6, as we are partial to the torgue of the larger engine. The car is very reliable, has a the basic power options, and handles well for a mid-size sedan. Comes with all-season touring tires that are also speed rated, which adds to the handling of cornering. It's a great little performer. It's not the G6 though, it's 25 ponies short, although I prefer the Grand Am design over that of the G6."

The 2.2L Ecotech engine rated at 140hp at 5,600rpm and 150lbs-ft of torque at 4,000 rpm delivers decent power in the upper rpm range and good power in town. I put it up to 107mph while rushing my wife to the hospital and it never acted funny and still had half pedal. I have no idea where the governor is set at. The driver's window control came loose at 69,000 miles but nothing super glue couldn't fix. It has a problem throwing Service Engine Soon lights if the gas cap isn't turned at least 3 clicks.

Now, at 56,000 miles, the only work I've had done so far was a front wheel bearing, but I hit a pothole so I'm pretty sure that was my fault, not Pontiac's fault.

pontiac,grand-am,2004,DJ, 05/02/2008,Jury's Still Out,3,Since I bought the car I have had several problems that I am told are COMMON problems with Grand AM. So my question is why are these not recall items. I have had to replace the Traction control sensors 3 times and I just had to replace the ignition lock and switch which are of course only dealer parts because they have to reset the security features so some $1000.00 later I have my car again until the next COMMON problem occurs. I like the Grand AM but would never by another one. Foreign cars seem to be the most reliable. And I am all for AMERICAN made but our cars don't compare and thats a shame.

A really excellent purchase. Besides the security issue with this car, as many other people here have pointed out, I've had one wheel bearing go out at 105,000 miles. To put this in perspective, I got the car with 98,000 miles on it, and it made it to 205,000 miles through 6 and 1/2 years until I slid and totaled it in the snow just recently (damage wasn't terrible, just no value left to it). And I consistently got roughly 30 MPG with it on mostly highway/backroad driving. The handling was always sharp too, but with the 4 cylinder there really wasn't much power behind it. I just wish they still made these, I would buy again.

My dad bought A V-6 version of this car in '05 almost new, however it was used as a rental car. The only problems we ever had with it were the windows came off track (not a big deal you can fix it yourself), the rear passenger window it dead no movement at all (happened this year), and when i was 10 i had a mini TV and my Xbox hooked up to the 12v outlet and blew a fuse and messed up the outlet. no matter what we do the fuses keep popping.

But overall now that its mine it is absolutely perfect for me to go back and forth to high school and work"

The only issues have been: the turn signal switch clicking (the factory put too much grease, I just removed some with a q-tip and it went away) and a battery. Otherwise it has been a good car. It is hard to see out when backing up, and it has a lot of road noise."

I was a little hesitant to buy this car because I like a lot of bells and whistles on an automobile. It came down to practibility for me. And for the money, I'm really pleased with my purchase. The car has a sporty feel even in the 4 door model. Makes me feel young again. HA!"
pontiac,grand-am,2005,Mikey, 04/23/2006,Value,4,"It just seems like consumer guides these days only rate the performance of the vehicle and totally ignore value. I'm here to tell you about the value of this car. I paid $16,000 CDN (after taxes) for a 1-yr old car loaded with features - all power - and with only 23,000kms w/ 2 yrs remaining on the warranty. What can you buy with this money? Zip. My friend bought a 2005 Civic, paid $24,000 CDN and has to manually roll up his windows! His car is so weak on hills that you feel like you need to get out and push. Ha! My GA flies up hills, has tons of low- end power and gets about 25-30mpg. The hype about foreign cars is bull.

pontiac,grand-am,2005,Courtney, 12/23/2015,NEVER will I get a Gm car again!,2,"I have had my Grand Am for 10 years. It was my first car. My mother bought me it for my first car. So I never had any time to get a new car due to college and I had a baby at age 22. But it was an excellent car until 105,000 miles. Then things started going wrong. At 105k, I had to get a leak repaired from the transmission. Then at 109k, I had to get a new radiator. After awhile, it was OK. But then at 117k miles, I had to get a WHOLE new engine due to it overheating BADLY. Then at 125k miles, I had to get a new ignition coil. 134k miles, it needed a new head gasket. Currently at 136k miles, it needs a catlytic converter. Very problematic. All of my car repairs were on a credit card :(. So i spent over $2k trying to keep this car strong. Too bad it's a crappy car.

pontiac,grand-am,2005,Don, 08/12/2006,Nice car!,4,"I bought this car used for my wife.  She had an '85 2-door sedan SE with a V- 6 and we both loved that one.   This one a 2005 4 door sedan with a V-8 was in great shape.  Paid $8500 from a private individual (through E-bay), but still got stung with sales tax in Michigan.   Care had 20,000 miles.  The V-6 is nice, but seems to not be as peppy as the 85 was.  This one has the spoiler, but no sunroof.  Had to replace a power window switch first thing.  Warranty work.   One other issue is the starter sticks ocassionally.  We'll have to take that in before the warranty expires. Can't complain,  Good car, great price and nice gas mileage."

Nothing major has broken yet, but the car is such a pile of plastic junk it seems about as reliable as a child's toy. Everything under the car is rusting. The paint is fading and flaking. There is body rust on it. The headlights are hazy and fogged. The car has been through 1 battery and 3 CV boots. The brakes were so rusted I needed to have a mechanic fix them. There is this horrible annoying, nonstop clicking from the blinkers that is apparently common with these.  Other than being a piece of plasticy junk, it is pretty zippy. If you don't need a reliable car, I'd recommend getting one. "

The sleek body style, and gas mileage of 31 miles per gallon was really a seller for me, it doesn't ride as smoothly as i expected it to, but i will ride it more and see how things go, and after all i have a 4cyling and not a 6 so i am sure that has something to do with the pickup of it.

pontiac,grand-am,2005,NotImpressed, 06/15/2008,Not Impressed,3,"I traded in a '03 Saturn for my Grand Am.  I was in tears a month after my trade.  The car inside is smaller than my little Saturn, the doors curve so it is hard to fit things in the back seat that you can't fit in the trunk because the opening to the trunk is too small.  The seats are not the most comfortable for road trips.  It is a lot of plastic on the inside and just make me think of a cheap Matchbox car the more I have to drive it.  The starter sticks more often than not and after purchasing the vehicle, I found out that this is a very common problem for the Grand Ams."

The comfort is good, the power is amazing (almost 2 much for the size!) and it is a lot of fun to drive.  I've had it over 6 months and I'm still not tired of it.  I paid $11,500 for it and feel like I made out like a bandit!!  ~~to the gentleman who said the ignition sticks- I was told by my Pontiac Dealer that if the car doesn't start immediately, the ignition will hold for a few seconds to try to start it and then release.~~"

It held up perfect! very solid car. I never had any problems. Now I have the 2005 GT1 and am even happier! I have driven with friends in there Honda's and they continue to say ""American cars break down and Japanese cars, never"" but the truth is, if you do your homework and read reviews, that is not true, they actually need servicing too, and the $$$ they put into it to preform like mine, haha. My car out classes anything next to it except for an Eclipse w/turbo I tried to race and a Corvette. I plan to add to the engine to enhance it more, the handling is perfect. Go Pontiac!"

pontiac,grand-am,2005,Keith, 01/14/2019,Scary car,1,"Once these cars hit 100,000 miles, they are destined to have the notorious security issue start up and plague you. This car is very cheap. I have been the only owner of mine, and keep up with maintenance (I am a mechanic, and actually love Pontiac) but they have dropped the ball on this one... the door check has been broke on 2 doors, all of the windows have eventually fallen off the tracks. The security light makes sure you are delayed 15 min of driving (look up grand am security issue on google). Otherwise, the engine has been torn down twice for blown head gasket, then for melted wires to the cam and crank sensors. I still own the car because after all this is fixed the car seems solid and is a great beater car!

Although the sort of roads I drove on are more suited for off-road vehicle this car never left me stranded. Despite the beating of unpaved dirt and gravel roads and the fact I was a rebel young driver who tested the limits and found out the max speed of car topping out at 110 mph before cutting out on more than one occasion this car is still going today and I am now 33 yrs old and the car has about 120k on it. During the time period of owning this car I was a service writer at auto repair shop and the techs have all helped me ensure the ongoing safety and maintenance of the car always taken care of and all have commented on how well the car has faired considering the abuse it has been through.

pontiac,grand-prix,2000,Brian B, 01/14/2016,One of the Best Cars I've Owned,4,"I've owned this car since it was brand new; it's been driven daily for the last 16 years by me and then by my son as his college vehicle.  At 172,000 miles, it continues to run strong and reliably.  The 3800 engine is a durable performer.  The transmission does act up a little on random occasions; primarily hard shifts.  The only significant issue I've had with this car is that I've had to replace the lower intake manifold gasket three times since it was new.  I also had to replace the radiator and sunroof motor.  Also, the headlights on these cars don't seem to put out near enough light.  The headlight and taillight lenses tend to collect condensation; but the paint has kept a strong shine and rust isn't a problem.  The interior of the car has held up well other than the leather on the steering wheel and one of the radio speakers.  There are very few squeaks or rattles on the car even now.  Visibility from inside is excellent all around.  Overall, the car is fun to drive, powerful and nimble enough to have a strong sporty feel, reliable and still economical.  I'd by another new one just like it if I could.

pontiac,grand-prix,2000,SMG_MP7A1, 01/05/2010,Great car at 9 years old,4,"This is an absolutely fantastic car. My GTP is 9 almost 10 years old and runs like new with 132,000 miles. I had a full run of tests done on this car when my a/c went out and it had only three problems 1.a/c pump went dead 2. small oil leak due to  old gasket on oil pan 3. Not exactly a problem yet but i was told to keep an eye on the CV boot. Fun to drive, starts just like a GM should, 0-60 somewhere in the mid 6's. pretty comfortable on long drives except the leather makes your back sweaty. got the a/c pump replaced and i am going to put a new oil pan gasket on myself during next oil change. This car I think could benefit from a 5 speed instead of a 4."

My stock motor on a Dyno put out 304 hp.

If you dream of Audi S4 performance, but need reliability, look no further than the Pontiac GTP. 

These engines are bullet proof, except for the occasional intake gasket which although time consuming is not a terrible job. $500 tops at any shop.

Have had this car for 2 years and still haven't/won't get bored with it. The roaring supercharger and exhaust make it all worth while. It's well worth using Premium Fuel. Red coupe, black leather, heated seat, Heads Up Display, fully loaded for a 2000. Even came with the original factory sticker. Bulletproof L67! Love the sound system! Plastic interior can be dull at times, but the red instrument panel lighting is awesome! If I could do it all over, I would. Sad to see Pontiac was discontinued."

Always started for me.
I owned it
from 90k to 140k.

The problem is the electronics around it.
Power steering rack leaks, gas gauge bounces around, traction control stops randomly, power windows love to break.
Brake cylinders seize, the led on the radio like to dance sometimes.
And nothing is $250 or less, everything is at least close to $400 or more to fix.
It still works if you can live with the flaws as it is extremely dependable.


Home mechanics go for it, but after 120k avoid it like the plague if you can't fix it yourself."

Water leaks around doors and trunk, lumbar support switch replaced several times, Bose radio led disappeared, heater fan replaced, headlight plastic replaced, power window switches quit working, auto feature on rearview mirror does not work, fuel pump replaced, brake light wiring shorted out, etc.  Major problems:  Car vibrates when accelerating.  Dealer replaced HUBS and axles and motor mounts three times as well as brake rotors.  Alignment did not help.  New tires did not help.  New wheels did not help. I just live with the vibration now. "

I'm the 6th owner, and it was passed down from my dad at 130k miles.
It's now at 210k miles, and I can say with pride that this car has never failed me.
Aside from when the battery was dead (the battery was 12 years old at the time and an easy jump got me goin'), it starts every morning as I begin my commute.
Whether it's the usual 30, the frequent 100, or the occasional 1000 miles, it's always ready to go.
Most of my maintenance has been regular, with a few big replacements such as the axles and brakes.
The transmission and the engine still feel fantastic, despite the dust and age."

Back door sides have been popping off, transmission has been going out, replaced starter, keys get stuck in ignition, only the passenger window will roll down, the vechile now shakes when under 45MPH, twice a year the windshield wipers need replaced, no trunk light, console cup holders have fallen off. This all happened within 3-4 yrs. of having the car. I have always taken care of my cars, but no matter how good I treat it, everything keeps breaking.

It gets me to and from where I need to go on a somewhat reliable basis, but everyday I Wonder when will be the next time it's not going to start and need yet another tow.

miles.  My 1994 developed transmission 
problems at 50K miles but toughed it 
out until 100K when it finally 
failed.  My 2000 is terrible.  The 
front windshield gushed water when it 
rained after 2 weeks - was missing 
about 4 inches of caulk.  The radio 
died.  The replacement died.  After 2 
years more water leaks coming in from 
the roof.  The interior lights will no 
longer go off - fuse pulled.  At 50K 
miles this car's transmission is 
failing worse than the previous one.  
It's made it to 60K miles but it won't 
make it to 70K.  It's a fun car to 
drive but I would not recommend it."

pontiac,grand-prix,2000,Eric, 07/23/2006,A Rotting Lemon,3,"Beyond the annual trips to the mechanic to fix a leak or a rattle, we had a to have the entire steering system replaced at 75000, the AC redone soon thereafter. Then the fun started. The dirver's side window motor broke, the driver's side seat mechanics broke, and the door panels are constantly popping out of place. Last week, the light for the radio and clock went out. Now we're replacing the radiator and selling it ASAP. It's fun to drive and handle's well, if only the roads to the mechanic's were more windy we could have more fun!"

pontiac,grand-prix,2000,barrys42, 08/09/2006,Reliable Pontiac,4,I've had 3 Grand Prixs before purchasing this one 6 1/2 years ago.  This has been by far the most reliable American car I've had.  The only things I've had repaired was a faulty ABS sensor (under warranty) and replaced the fan motor.  Evidently there is a small discharge hole that can clog easily and rust out the motor.  The performance of the Grand Prix is great for such a heavy car.  A heavy car certainly helps for stability and passenger protection.  My MPG averages about 19-20 in city driving and gets around 30 on the highway.  MPG has improved with time.  The interior leather is cheap but comfortable.  The Heads Up Display is such a great item I don't know why it's not offered more.
pontiac,grand-prix,2000,awos, 03/15/2012,Great Car,5,"This is our second Pontiac and what a car.
Regular maintance and thats it. 122,000 miles and 4 new struts and she's always ready.

After putting on about 2000 miles the car now quits and may or may not start again. Pretty much have it sitting and collecting dust now. Read on the internet that this was a common problem. Not sure if I want to stick money into it.

pontiac,grand-prix,2000,Patrick, 02/11/2018,"Was a true champion, God bless our little Pontiac!",5,"My mother purchased a white 2000 Grand Prix GT Coupe with 22,358 miles back in 2001. She needed a good car to get back and forth from her 2 jobs. M dad left before I was born and never paid a dime. They couldn't even find him to make him pay child support etc...Long story short, she got this Pontiac. I still remember the day. I was 10 or 11. This car always got her to work, me to school and all my sports events, any random emergency, and even the joyrides I used to take without permission in my early teen years. It never broke down. Not once. Not once in 17/18 years. It did need sway bars and a new headlight cover but only basic maintenance was ever needed. Last Monday my mother was on her way to work when she slide on black ice and tried to turn away from the car at the red light ahead. Swiped the front end bouncing off the car into a snowbank. The snowbank did the majority of the damage. She was okay which is another great testament to this vehicle! It needed towed out of the snowbank yet still drove but insurance deemed it totaled. I still wanted to pay to keep it and fix it but it would have been a huge strain on me financially. We planned on having forever. I would have loved to have it when I'm an old man and been like this was my mothers car. The accident happened with the car having only 124,500 miles, Easily had another 100,000 left. Today I went to get the license plates off at the tow lot. Very sad day for us. It was the car of my youth. It went through everything with us and never let us down. If this car was good enough for a single mother to raise a boy in the Midwest with, it is good enough for anybody. Forever, it will be my favorite car. God bless our little Pontiac!

perfect, this one comes close if you 
want low cost high performance.  Stock, 
the GTP run hard. With small changes 
like a reduced diameter supercharger 
pulley and K&N intake you can run with 
Z-28's and Mustang Cobra's. The GTP is 
the Grand National of the 90's. I'm on 
my 3rd GTP and I could'nt be happier."

In it's defense, I bought it from an auction so who knows how it was taken care of.
But it ran great!
It was super fast.
Then things started breaking, exhaust, window switches, suspension, leaky valve covers.
I had a bad feeling but never wanted to sell it when the transmission decided to blow.
The first gear totally destroyed itself.
Will not own one of these again, going back to my mustangs which get 200,000 miles on them before they go out."

On the highway keeping my foot out of the injectors I have gotten as much as 36mpg around town I average 23 to 24mpg. I really enjoy the car the ride is great for what it is, noise level is low and I absolutely love the HUD. When power is needed its here in a heartbeat. I have had no major mechanical issues. Most issues presented themselves during warranty period and were corrected. Only the interior carpeting was cheap crap and had to be replaced about a uear ago. This was a little expesive but worth every penny. This car is in as good a shape as it was coming of the showroom floor."

Handling is very good and you can take curves and stuff faster than normal cars. As for some of this reviews below, these cars DO NOT have a timing belt!  This is the old timing chain, pushrod, dependable motor that has been around forever! (since the 70s) As for the bad... Its not common to have a steering itermediate shaft go out... Bad GM design.  *dealerships tend to try and replace the Rack and Pinion to cure this sound* beware its usually the shaft! "

Got the car with 131k on it (pretty low compared to the rest I looked at!) and drive it home... you can tell this car has had a rough life. Yet it still runs very, very reliably. Brakes were completely rusted over, ti rods were so bad my mechanic feared for my safety, yet this car never gives out on me. Now at 145k and the tranny starting to slip, it still is a very reliable car. It's just had a rough life, and for as badly as it was taken care of before it runs excellently. "

Brakes have been replace twice, third time coming soon.  Front wheel bearings and inner tie rod replaced and that's about all other than some minor warranty work early on.

pontiac,grand-prix,2000,Eric D, 05/01/2010,10 year original owner,4,"Bought my Grand Prix Dec 26, 1999. Absolutely loved to drive it. The car was great until it hit about 75k miles, then things really started to wear down.  Had one major repair of the rack and pinion and power steering at the same time. Was about a $1500 repair.  Many other little things also began to fall apart since 75k. Driver power window quit working. Gas gauge began to malfunction and I had to track the fuel level with the trip odometer. Also, the low coolant light was always lit and even the fluids were topped off. The carpeting wore very early on.  Overall, it was a satisfying ownership but mostly because I paid it off two years earlier then I had expected and owned it free and clear."

To roll down the passenger window from my driver side sometimes it doesn't work and then a few minutes later it does, but other than these problems I do love my car I just recently got brakes for it and the tires were still in great shape.

In the 5 years I've owned the car it has lived up to the reputation.  It has had a few small issues(key gets stuck in the ignition occasionally and LED backlight on radio went out), some of which I caused(warping the brakes 3 times oops!), but it has been an excellent car! It has good looks, enough power to get out of it's own way, and it has been reliable.  It's a ""sleeper"" in the sense you can save a ton of money over a Japanese car since they depreciate a lot, but are quite reliable"

pontiac,grand-prix,2000,eric116, 07/28/2011,Best Car I've Owned,4,"I love this car.
I bought it only for $100 dollars back in April after I traded in my 03 impala for it, yes i know I downgraded to a 2000, but the Impala was starting to rust and the Grand Prix had no rust and I've always wanted a GP and it always slipped through my grasp until now.
The only problem I have had with the GP is the windsheild has a crack in it, not the big of a problem being that it is not in my line of sight.
Plus my ac and heating had a weird problem where the drivers side only blew hot air even with the ac on but the passengers side worked just fine at first but it corrected itself right before summer."

bat with my GTP.  With not more than 
3000 miles on the car it completely 
broke down on me.  After several trips 
to the dealership it was finally fixed 
and I have not had a problem since.  I 
absolutely enjoy the power the car outs 
out, and the interior cannot be beat.  
Overall, the grand prix GTP is an 
outstanding vehicle and my next 
purchase coming up in about 6 months 
will be another GTP as well."

with the tail lights not working.  I 
got that fixed at the dealership.  No 
other problems."

years with the exception of trim coming 
off around the windows or other minor 
things. Just recently I have been 
having bigger problems. Door panels are 
low quality with connectors that break 
very easily (plastic!). Even more 
frustrating is the window regulator 
that failed. The dealership wants $450 
to fix - ridiculous! They are poorly 
designed and can be expected to go bad 
in time...so beware and don't use your 
electric windows."

with the car until at 72,000 miles my 
transmission went.  I had 
every scheduled maintenance (including 
the tranny fluid and filter being 
changed at 50K) done on the car as 
scheduled.  Transmission place said the 
seal on the tranny was cracked, thus 
causing the fluid to leak out and burn 
out the transmission.  $2200.00 later, 
I am the proud owner of a rebuilt 
tranny.  I was sold on these cars until 
this, and now question the quality of 
Pontiac's cars.  I called Pontiac about 
this, and got blown off.  I would 
strongly suggest you have this checked 
on your next maintenance, and save 
yourself a big expense."

transmission went out.  Not just a 
little but the planetary gear locked up 
and came apart, ruining my entire 
transmission.  The dealership and the

Right now, the DRL's won't turn on, but to be honest, I think it almost looks better without them.  This car is great around town, and will easily get around anything too slow on the highway.

The 3.8L engine and wide track suspension make it a dream to drive. Even though it is a 2000, I think it is one of the best looking cars on the road - the gentleman at the car wash place are particularly impressed.

that the tank did not have to be

at 30.  Car handles well with plenty of 
power.  Some of the interior components 
are cheap.  Like some others, the door

previously, to a 2000 Pont. GP GT 4dr I 
have to say is a HUGE improvement. The 
94 lasted 195,000 miles before needing 
an engine overhaul, and required 
continous dealer visits for plugs

$5,000 in repairs (inc a new tranny 
which is VERY expensive)between 140,000 
and 175,000 (2yrs total) **HOWEVER** 
The 2000 Pont. is a VERY different 
tale. I bought the vehicle from a non 
pontiac dealer in 2003 for $11,000 with 
44,000 miles on it, to date I have put

It does very good on long road trips. Now the bad part. Luckily when we (fiancee and I) bought the car, we got the extended warranty. It has helped pay for the $5K in repairs of this car. So far - intake & exhaust manifold gaskets have been replaced, HVAC fan was stuck on high, steering rack & pump replaced, front drivers side ball joint went out and in a ""chain reaction"" of events - broke the drivers side axle in two, replaced both of the tie rods.

Water leaks, bearings, undiagnosed vibrations, excessive road noise and tire wear, a stereo system with speakers that constantly cut out, and non-stop computer problems made this car the worst I have ever owned.

However, the last 44K (currently has 94K on it)has been another story. First the transmission (seems like a popular complaint) went out. Unfortunately, didn't have extended warranty. Then a power window, the ABS is malfunctioning causing the brakes to shudder when applied until the ABS turns itself off. I have also gone through 3 ""seven year"" batteries.

The blower motor failed at about 75k. The alternator and battery failed soon thereafter. The AC works great but makes squealing noises for years now. Have tried everything short of replacing compressor to fix it. Dealers want $400+ to fix the Pontiac- designed window motor problems.

Replacing the battery is a real bear. Dash rattles a bit over bumps. I am watching a possible leaky valve cover gasket. Aside from that, this car rocks.  Performance, fuel economy and looks are all outstanding. I lucked out and found this model with every single feature offered. It was a $29,000 car in 2000.  Added Mobil 1 to the engine and trans and, a K&N filter and am now experiencing 30 mpg on the highway.  "
pontiac,grand-prix,2000,ginah04, 04/08/2003,Okay Car,3,"I have owned my Grand Prix for approx. 
3 years and can't wait to get rid of it 
for a few reasons. First, I want to say 
that this car is not all bad. It has 
great styling and excellent handling. 
There are a few things I wish I had 
read up on before purchasing.  First, 
the car has a lot of electronic 
problems. I have had 4 motors in my 
windows replaced in only 3 years! The 
car rattles A LOT in the dash area and 
the noises are just about impossible to 
get rid of, also very annoying! I don't 
drive the car that much (4-5 days a 
week) and my rotors were pitted after 
18,000 miles and had to be replaced."
pontiac,grand-prix,2000,ponty, 04/08/2003,pontys,5,"It is fun to drive due to the 
handeling, engine performance, with a 
balanced economy. the style is for 4 
people to fit comfortly, and still 
look like a sports car. This is my 
second grand prix and I would by 
another one, a two door version only."
pontiac,grand-prix,2000,GTParty, 04/11/2003,Best American Performance Sedan,4,"I enjoyed this car.  A great balance of 
performance and fuel economy from the 
supercharged engine.  Great handling 
and I liked the looks as well.  
Reliability might be questionable over 
the long run.  I didn't have some of 
the problems other people had, but then 
again, I traded mine in in Dec 2002 to 
get a new Yukon.  If you get one that 
was well maintained, you will probably 
enjoy it a great deal."
pontiac,grand-prix,2000,The Icon, 04/20/2007,Pontiaction,4,"I bought the car brand new with all the available options possible including the Bose sound system. I dont drive the car very far at all but when I do it is pure excitement and I get looks when I am next to another car. When I first had it, I did have seal leak problems and the steering, when very cold outside, seems stiff. Other than this I had good luck with the car. It just turned 7yrs old in February and it looks new, had several offers to buy it from me , including my mechanic. "
pontiac,grand-prix,2000,gina, 07/17/2007,Reliable Grand Prix,4,"I purchased the car new in 2000 and I currently have 65,000 miles on her. My only major complaint is the regulators/motors for the windows, at least 15 times since new combined all windows and I rarely use the back windows. The headlight lens have been foggy since 15,000 miles and GM refused to fix under warranty. Other problems, lost fan speeds for climate controldriver door panel is loose, and a blown speaker. It's been paid off for years and only requires routine maintence, oil changes, 1 new battery, new tires on front &and 2 new tires and brake pads at 60k. I love my car and won't part with it!"
pontiac,grand-prix,2000,vgopaul, 08/30/2007,A lot of Mechanical Problems,2,"I have had this car for going on four years. My driver side motor window went out, I have had to replace the timing belt, ball joints, get a new radiator, replace my entire power steering, heater coil, rocking pena (however thats spelled), not to mention typical ware and tare on the car such as brakes (which I expect to pay for). I couldn't believe it because I take really good care of that car. I had a Pontiac before this and experienced the same problems. I will never by a GM product again. It is a very nice car, but mechanically it has costs me thousands. My entire family buys Pontiacs, but after two experiences like this in a row- it behooves us to purchase these vehicles. "

crisply.  The only complaints are the 
cupholders which suck.  they're too 
shallow and right where i'd like to

month, I had to take it back for 
service 3 times:  the battery failed, 
the AC stopped working & the console 
lights failed.

Over 3 years, I've had to get the AC 
fixed 2 more times, replace the battery 
twice (and this is through normal use, 
I never left the lights on or 
anything), and various other nitpicky 
things.  There really must be some 
problem with the electrical system.

It's a decent car, and nothing TOO 
terrible has gone wrong with it, but 
the accumulation of little things just 
made owning it a pain."
pontiac,grand-prix,2000,Jim327, 06/30/2003,2000 GTP,2,"Car started out great, suspension soon
rode like a 85 towncar, couldn't take a
turn at any speed, very ""floaty"". Dealer
said nothing they could do.  Went ahead
and installed all new suspesion, not a
cheap thing.  This helped.  At 30000
miles, both outer tie-rod end went out.
 At 38,000 miles, both wheel hubs had to
be replaced, due to worn out bearings. 
Trunk leaked, HUD went out for a while,
driver window is intermitent.  And now
the plastic bolts holding the bumper on
are starting to break, causing the car
to rattle when going over any bumps. 
This car has 42000 miles on it. Will be
the last American car that I buy for a
long time.  Unless it is pre '75."

The first week I owned it, it left me stranded on the side of the road twice. Dealer was very good about fixing it. It was the fuel pump. It went out twice before 60K. I have had to replace all 4 wheel bearings, and brakes 3 times. Front end is constantly shuddering, no matter how many alignments you have done. Has a good deal of power, and fuel economy isn't bad @ an average 22 mpg. I know have 111K on this car, and my wife wrecked it yesterday. They will surely total it, and I will be sad to see it go. Also, i just got a recall notice in the mail stating that oil can leak onto the exhaust manifold and cause the car to catch fire. "
pontiac,grand-prix,2000,Rodd, 03/23/2008,Love it!,4,"Bought the car used in 2002 with 33K miles.  Other than having to replace the crank position sensor (car would shut off while driving down the road), and ABS issues (which would correct itself after disconnecting the battery for a few minutes)and normal wear and tear items, the car has been fantastic.  I have 123,000 miles on it and just love it.  It is a great looking car and I still get regular comments on it.  Drove it from Michigan to Florida in 2006 (1,800 miles) and average 33 MPG."
pontiac,grand-prix,2000,lowlovesu, 01/28/2012,I like my car but......,3,"I purchased my grand prix gt a few years ago at auction. It had 101tho. miles. The car looked good and ran well at first but then many big issues began coming up. It seems each time it breaks down its at least 300 in repairs, it makes a gosh awful sequel.The belt was replaced twice and it still squeals? Also my gas gauge quit working awhile back . It also has some electrical glitches because random lights on the panel go on for example the low fuel light goes on all the time as well as the oil and coolant lights (even when all these things are changed) and the open trunk light doesn't work at all. Also the car is rusting pretty bad underneath But for 12 yrs old and counting its a decent car!"
pontiac,grand-prix,2000,Josh L, 05/22/2008,2000 Grand Prix,4,"Apart from being a sexy looking car, the Grand Prix is a great performer and very fun to drive. As with any Pontiac, though, its interior is plasticky. "
pontiac,grand-prix,2001,Roadrasher, 10/25/2010,1 owner @ 100k mi.,4,"The Supercharged 3.8 Series II engine is very reliable. 100,000 miles and the engine is flawless, but the rest of the car started falling apart.  The Supercharger is not a serviceable item, so when the bearing goes out you have to replace the whole thing ($600 rebuild w/ installation).  Both front wheel- bearings needed replacing.  Power- steering pump went out.  All within 10,000 miles of 100k.  The car is definitely worth keeping and repairing.  The GTP is the only way to go. If you are considering a Grand Prix, only get one w/ a Supercharger (20% more horsepower than the GT, and it shows). Before buying one, listen to the supercharger, if you hear a grind, get it replaced."
pontiac,grand-prix,2001,Russ, 11/12/2010,Last of the classic Grand Prixs...,4,"The GTP coupe is truly the last of the classic Grand Prix line.Nothing against sedans,but this is the best looking model since the '70s.At 3,500 lb it has the weight to match the 240 hp/280 ft.lb.supercharged 3.8L engine.Feels like the classic performance models of '60s.At 73,000 miles there's been no major problems except a dead battery and dry-rotted tires.Slight oil seepage but that happens at higher mileage. Gas mileage isn't that bad for a supercharged engine, using premium actually gives it better mileage, go figure. Nice leather interior, drivers seat is comfortable when finally dialed in. Overall a sharp, solid car."

It's pretty fast for being 13 years old and that 3800 Series II engine is a beast. My car personally has trouble starting and the key gets stuck in the ignition. i know the key getting stuck in the ignition is a common problem, but if this happens, there is a hole (you may need to remove a little plastic cover) under where you would insert the key on the steering column. You just use a pen or something, push in the little knob and you can remove the key. There are some websites or videos telling you how to. But this is a great car and would recommend to people!"

My only gripe with the car is the power window motors have gone bad on two different windows four times total, the time display in the radio went bad, and the sunroof cover broke. If not for little things like this going bad, the car has been great. Good pickup and about 18-20 MPG for the most part. No problems with the engine or transmission after 74K miles..."

It only had about 65k on it and was in mint condition. I love everything about this car except for the rims that come on the special edition package, a minor setback. I have had no problems yet and I hope to not have any either. I love the gas mileage coming from a diesel truck that was getting around 11 mpg Yikes! It will get up and go with the best of them and stay up pretty good. It does govern out at 126 but I don't think that's a prob since I won't be going that fast all the time.."

It has been a very fun car to drive, and I  never grew tired of looking at it. Now one has to step up to a Buick to get the Heads Up display which I use all the time.   It had a leaky manifold gasket at 74 K miles which I fixed immediately and so far I have not had the bigger problem with a failed head gasket which some of the GM Dex Cool engines have experienced. I have had to replace some wheel bearings in front, steering gear, and other suspension components.  I still drive it to work daily and I have had a mechanic offer to buy it.

Just replaced 1 fuel injector at 105,000 miles myself as well as transmission fluid and spark plugs. Car is loosing a little coolant through leaks I believe in manifold or head gasket.

This car is much more exciting in both the exterior and interior with the excellent bose sound system and HUD, etc. The performance was good, but not that much better than my intrepid. The transmission does not shift nearly as smoothly as the Intrepid, it feels like you are ""beating"" on it no matter how careful you are. I had the tranny checked out by two different shops and they both say it's OK. So no big deal. I had a wheel bearing go out at about 40k miles. My windshield washer pump went out at 60k. Had the belts and thermostat replaced. Nothing major. Overall I'm pretty satisfied."

It has been one of the greatest gifts of my life and am very grateful and thankful to GOD! It currently has 170500 miles on it and is black with reasonable amounts of rust for a Michigan car. Since I got the car in August 2015 it had had the front brakes, rotors, left wheel bearing, exhaust resonator, power steering line all replaced. However the supercharger belt needs replacing as well as new headlights, possible new supercharger parts, intake gaskets, air filter, AC compressor, and right passenger outer door panel all needs replacing. Other than repairs when the supercharger is going it's pretty quick and keeps up with newer more powerful cars and gets between 24-28 mpg highway and 16-22 city which could be better. One of the best cars ever had!

Needless to say, I wasn't too happy, but I did end up getting a GM warranty when I purchased it. Now, about 11 months later, it sounds like it's acting up once again. Get an extended warranty, unless you don't plan on keeping it for very long. And like with all warranty work, the dealers like to take their sweet time getting your car repaired..."

Cleaned but the bad news was the drivability was bad because both bearings were  bad and needed replacing,had like 5 engine service lights codes and the transmission keep shifting erratically,oil leaks and intake gasket is cheap the car from the previous owner pretty much left IT for dead but the car had plenty of recalls even had to replace the water pump twice

The first week of ownership, the transmission started to kick in between 1st & 2nd gear while accelerating, ($2500 repair) it still continues to be a problem but cannon afford to fix transmission, rather deal with discomfort till I buy something better. Head gasket is on the edge of blowing, just driving a short distance and I can smell the dexcool leaking ($1500 repair) on to the hot engine. Power feels weak in the city, very stiff pedal, must apply a lot of force to accelerate. Bushings in the front are flattened, going around turns makes the car feel like its on ice year round ($1000 repair)"

pontiac,grand-prix,2001,braindeadunit, 12/28/2012,"Fun car, hindered by GM",3,"The 3.8L makes this a pretty fun car to drive, however, as a GM ""cookie cutter"" car, it suffers from subpar engineering and build quality. Panels like to fall off, something that could've been prevented with a better plastic. The powertrain is generally reliable, but that's about it. You can eek pretty good mpg out of this car, but it's a bit of a pain to do so. If great MPG is your priority, look elsewhere, but don't worry about this car burning holes in your pocket."
pontiac,grand-prix,2001,Caselynn, 08/04/2008,Great Car 3rd Grand Prix,4,"This is the third grand prix I have owned, and I must say I have NO complaints! I have had only small problems, the switch on the fan only works at 3+, and the light on the radio doesn't light up. I get 30 mpg on highway, and 26 in town. I have a lifter tapping which is annoying but not serious. It always runs and drives and I am at 160,000 miles so far. I had a 94 SE which made it to 250,000, and I drove my 98 GT to 180,000 with only a minor oil leak when I sold it. I love this car and I am impressed, I have owned many others but keep coming back to Pontiac."

Bought this car for a reasonable price back in '05 with a GM certified warranty. This car has needed periodic maintenance per the owners manual of which absolutely no one follows. Doing the correct fluid flush's on time, the filters, injection cleaning, wires, plugs, brakes, tires. Its motor is bullet proof. I plan on keeping this car another 3 or 4 more years and I can most certainly expect with normal on time maintenance, it will perform as desired. It hauls quickly o-60, it handles incredible, has plenty of room. Some cheap interior stuff, but it just can be overlooked with its looks and reliability. "

It did have 89,000 miles on it, but still should not have had that many issues. I've had to replace the breaks, roaders, some of the wiring and tires since buying it.I currently need to replace a head gasget and have oil leaking into my anti-freeze, which is a repair that is going to cost me a little over a thousand dollars. I was told that most Grand-Prixs start having mechanical problems once they reach about 65,000 miles."

My bad. but it never hurt the starter. I really miss the car and may get another after seeing one on the road today. I bought mine brand new in 2001 and replaced it in 2007 to buy my daughter a used car. She liked it and learned to drive in it but wanted something smaller. when i got rid off it i racked up 160,000. mostly highway miles to and from work. the only problem i ever had was one power window motor which i fixed myself.Never had to do a timing belt because it was chain driven and never had to replace any CV joints or driveshafts. Just normal wear and tear items."

My Grand Prix is the best purchase I have ever made.  The Pontiac 3.8 L engine is by far the best production engine ever made.  If it is well mantained it will never wear out.  I've had mechanics tell me they've seen 3.8's with the oil run out of them and seize not even need new rings!  They run strong with excellent fuel economy and power - what more is there to want??  "

When I first saw the grandprix I absolutely loved it. The aggressive front end, flared fenders, and  its aggressive stance. I purchased it with 125,000 miles and it drove like it had 25,000 miles on it. Performance is on point, handling is precise, BUT fuel economy was extremely poor. I spent almost the same amount of money on gas as i did with my Explorer. I realize that the vehicle saves gas with 89 and above fuel grade than the lower grade 87. It even improved the performance. Overall this is the best car i ever had!"

fun to drive and has fabulous 
acceleration.  I would love to buy 
one.  However, tend to keep a car for 
more than 5 years and Ponitac's 
reliability is unproven. (read 
professional reviews as well as these)  
I do not trust the car's alternator, 
starter, or power train 
(transmission).  I would definately 
recommend renting one and possibily 
leasing one for 2 years or less.  If 
you buy get rid of this car at the 2 to 
3 year mark, let somebody else be the 
case study for Ponitac.  As soon as a 
see many 8 to 10 year old Grand Prixs 
driving around I might buy one."

The catalytic converter went out at about 55K, and the transmission started operating real sloppy.  From there the transmission went downhill.  The transmission had a certain lag when you needed to accelerate and it started making funny noises.  At 85K the transmission started dropping into gears and continued to sound worse.

I didn't have any problems with the car 
until 62,000 when the transmission 
went. It cost $2650 to replace.  It was 
out of warranty but luckily it was a 
company car and they payed the bill.

I purchased the car from the company

We recently replace an EGR valve for 
$175 but had no other problems.

Bought my 01 GP SE 2 years ago with almost 28k on it and now have 70k on it. Only prob was computer needed reset while still under warranty, new radio fuse. I've had no major issues thankfully. I have had some noise occasionally when I start the car which hasn't been figured out but never had a prob starting the car. Gas mileage seems to be getting a little worse with age/more mileage. Piece holding glove box up when opened broke so now it falls out sometimes when opened. That's it...minor at best. I would suggest this car for sure!"

went out on us. Both of these problems 
were quickly fixed and covered under

mileage is not exactly stupendous but 
its not a compact. Power when

to the total driving feel of this sport 
sedan around turns or navigating

Heater knob cracked, starter replaced, power window control replaced, leaked antifreeze, had seals replaced. New problem every 6 months - thankful for extended warranty. Have owned 2 pontiacs for 7 years each, both grand ams. Have to say I'm disappointed with this grand prix. Exterior paint did not hold up and interior carpet matted"
pontiac,grand-prix,2001,jzone2020, 09/15/2005,It gets looks,4,"I have the 2 door GTP special edition. The hood scoops and roof racing rails are a nice touch and along with the 4 tailpipe dual exhaust system make the car looks meaner than the 240hp it has. The only problem I had is rain leaked in from the passenger side door, which wet the back carpet. Dealer fixed and everything else has been great. I wonder about the transmission though as I read other reviews here. Thus far all is good. Car rides smooth and the supercharger sure provides awesome pickup. I love the way it looks (unlike the 2004- models) as well as rides."

They called me back saying that it appears that a bearing is going and pieces are floating around the transmission. Cost to repair it, $3400. Not too happy about GM build quality after this. The other issues I've had are ""warped"", distorted windshield, a spot in the paint that had been redone poorly at the factory, and a leaky rear window that had water sloshing underneath the rear seats onto the floor."

First, my tires did not last anytime-they were ""chopped up"" to quote the dealer and I had all the scheduled maintenence. The valves had to be replaced and the transmission has not been the same-I expect it to go out anytime! Goofy things inside have gone wrong, the controller for the windows had to be replaced, the strip on the driver side window broke, among other things. The cruise control only works part of the time and the accelerator for it never works. This week my passenger tie rod had to be replaced and universal joint is going out! You pretty much name it, and I've had problems with this car. I love driving this car, but it's a pile of junk! CurrentlyCarShopping"

Luckily, I have escaped the tranny problems so far, we'll see.  All you owners out there, BEWARE.  The catalytic converter on these, the GTs, and the GTPs are bad.  There IS a warranty to 80,000 miles on the SE, and they raised it to 120,000 for the others.  I have an SE.  Got it fixed at 79,600 miles, didn't even know about the warranty.  sweet!  Oh, by the way.  This thing cost 21 grand new, and is now worth 5.  Can you say ""Honda"" from now on!!!!!!"
pontiac,grand-prix,2001,Greg, 01/13/2006,Needs toys to get going,3,"I bought my GTP when it was two years old and had only 7k on it. At first I really like the torque of the supercharger, but after ridding in other non-supercharged six cylinder coupes/sedans i'm no longer impressed that much. The car has a nice exterior look to it, but once you open the door and set inside the cheesy interior appointments is what gets your attention. Way too much plastic inside. I have to say that the drivers seat is very comfortable, but the passenger seat is a bear. I've put 2k worth of go fast goodies in her and she now performs at a level that she should have stock with the almost 30k MSRP she had when new. Pontiac has lost there love afair with true real world performance"

pontiac,grand-prix,2001,El Squid, 09/06/2006,Life with a Red GTP,4,"I bought a used GTP because GM decided to discontinue the 2-door version. I am amazed at how little fuel it takes to propel the GTP along open highways. Conversely, when engaging in stoplight gymnastics it rips through premium gas like, well you know what I mean.  It's a shame that along with discontinuing the GTP coupe, the performance shift switch was also deleted. Hooray for Hypertech whose reprogrammer allows the return of fast shifts and also disables the silly governor. In spite of the car's 145 mph capability I drive the car within posted limits except when visiting the Nevada desert and other fun places. Besides, 30 mpg is available on the interstate if driven gently."
pontiac,grand-prix,2001,thundercat, 03/20/2003,Galexy Silver,4,"I was at the dealership getting a 
headlight replacement for my 96 Grand

The sky 
reflected against it's Galexy Silver 
finish. I peared out the 
corner of my eye at it's glossy black 
tires in contrast to cold & very 
smooth polished alloy wheels. ""What a 
sexy looking sedan."" I thought to 
myself. 
Test drove it and never got that 
pitiful headlight replaced. Even 
though, I only had one year left on 
the loan, I just had to 
tell 'thundercat 96' good-bye.  
Ride is excellent for freeway

Smooth cushy ride."
pontiac,grand-prix,2001,PGPS, 03/24/2003,Nice car,4,"So far this car has been great to me, I 
bought it 9 months ago and it was nice 
to me. The acceleration is really good 
for a heavy sedan, the handling is 
excellent, it's very spacious inside. I 
have 17 inch wheels on it so the ride 
isn't that smooth but a lot smother 
than other cars with 13 or 14 inch 
wheels. The sound system is awsome. I 
like the six speaker CD player and even 
on noisy radio stations it plays clear. 
So overall the car is awsome I had no 
problems with at all except change the 
oil and filter. What I don't like about 
this car is the where the cup holders 
are located, it's hard to swith gears 
when it's open, other than that it's a 
very nice car."

My mechanic flushed all the DexCool out and replaced it with normal coolant. It has been that way for 5 years now, no problems. I love the way the car drives, looks, runs, and the power it has.

I bought this 2001 Grand Prix Prix GT Special edition after Owning a 1998 Bonneville. I wanted to upgrade to a sportier car, but still needed four doors. I really liked the design and options--it is pretty much loaded but soon experienced many problems. At 35,000 when I bought the car the steering rack had to be replaced. At about 45,000 wheel bearings started to go. Three so far. Along with both front coil springs breaking--one of them twice(GM parts),tie rods, etc.  I don`t mind replacing brakes (even those wear out too fast) and normal wear parts, but these other parts should not wear out so fast. The car always starts and the handling is fine. "

Currently at 181K miles and I may need some new belts, but other than that, the engine is a haus. Feels like I couldn't do anything other than crash it to stop this thing from running. Best car for the money if you don't mind riding in a pontiac. Took it on a 3k roadtrip in the 170K range, and it made it there and back with only a wheel bearing that needed replaced. Regular problems/maintenance with this car, bearings, brakes (better than most cars), rear windows, some sensor problems, and from my experience and noting others, usually tranny needs to get rebuilt at some point during the life of the car.

The DEXcool eats the gaskets though so i would suggest getting normal coolant. The interior has some cheap plastics but overall feels very nice. Seats are supportive, Cushy. My radio backlight has gone out after the years. I bought the car for $300 as the past owner wanted it gone. I was looking for a GT but i have to say, This SE is still a great car and is definitely better than the Grand AM which is what i would have gotten if i didnt get my Grand Prix. This car is very large to. Holds plenty in the trunk and the pass through behind the back seat center console is a great feature as well!  It has the aggressive look of the GT in the front unlike the 97-00 SE. I plan on putting a GT Bumper on the rear to make it look a bit more aggressive. Overall VERY much worth the price I paid and would suggest this car to anybody! Did I forget to mention that the MPG is good with the 3100 to?

It gets up to 30MPG-which was a 2200 mile trip at about 83 MPH in Mn and ND when it was at abt 110K. Uses no oil. Only irritating thing is the water leaking into tail lights.

A handsome looking car with the most interior room of any car I've ever had.  Handled great, very smooth ride.   As cars age things invariably have to be replaced and I've decided to just sell the car and let someone else replace them.  It never got great gas mileage due to the six cyl engine and the overall weight of the car.  I never took it on any great road trips---a 650 mile round trip was the longest I ever took with it.  But it's solid for in-town driving.  Given it's now 2018, the 2002 Grand Prix is ageing gracefully and if you get one you have to treat it kindly.  It is too bad that Pontiacs aren't made anymore.  The Pontiac Grand Prix was/is a solid car.  I think the last car my grandfather owned was a Grand Prix, now that I think of it.

Almost 12 years later with just under 110,000 miles on it, she is still going strong.

Other than that snafu, it hasn't given me any trouble. I love this car.  Hubby wants me to trade it in for something newer with more bells and whistles, but I can't part with it.

styling. I was immediately surprised 
with its performance, which led mo to 
trade in on a 2001 GTP. This car's 
performance is simply  awesome. The 
horsepower is definitely under rated. I 
took it to the west coast and loved the 
smoothness, comfort, handling and 
power, especially in the mountains,

With only 114,000 kms and mint inside and very good outside it was pretty much brand new! Anyway, on to my review!

According to the previous owner the transmission was replaced at 130,000 miles. I have had very little trouble with this car, the only real repair it has needed was that the rocker panels needed to be replaced. This is a great looking vehichle with classic great looking Pontiac lines. My least favorite part of this car was the low quality of the interior, which I feel that I could easily tear apart. The performance of this car has been outstanding though. Though the 3.1L isn't as fast as the 3.8L, it is much less prone to blowing head gaskets and mine has gotten to 238K miles and I still haven't had an issue. I get great gas mileage(19 City, 32 Highway), and the wide body design makes steering feel controlled, as I once was able to evade a moose going 60 in a 55!

Water pump,  abs system,  radiator cleaned and fuel pump. In 8 yrs that is great. Transmission and engine are still strong and the gas mileage is great. Interior has some flaws but  not too bad and it has had issues with holding water after extremely wet seasons but believe that was a previous owner /mechanic issue by removing seals. Bought a new vehicle due to family growth and needs but still have this as our just in case vehicle and will be passed on to the kids.

I replaced the tires with BF Goodrich Traction T/a's at 39K the thing handles like a sports car great in rain/snow and NJ's horrendous roads. Still looks good and runs great after 75000 miles. I plan to buy another in a short time.   "

still trying to sell, but no one will 
give me close to what orginally paid.  
The most uncomfortable seats ever!  At 
5'4"", average ht for women, I can't 
reach the gas pedal (located 6"" farther 
back than the brake).  This is a 
terrible design flaw as my foot slips 
off the gas often.  When pushed 
forward, the seat goes ""up"", making my 
head touch the sunroof/visor.  Also, 
seat belt cuts off circulation to my 
legs & I constantly tug at it (I'm 
quite thin too. The car has a few good 
points, but comfort and ride are 
terrible, plus insurance costs are 
outrageous for a 4-door sedan."

When I got it, it had 122000miles on it, which though high isn't too high. Since buying this car, I've had 3 windows crap out on me, only fixing the driver side one. It cost about $350 at a dealership to get the window fixed, luckily I found a local mechanic to do it for a lot cheaper. Though now the ignition won't recognize the car as being in park, therefore not releasing the key. Problems just keep adding up, I am able to bypass the the ignition to release the key but I cannot recommend this car. There are multiple reviews online showing that I am not alone, pontiac uses cheap parts making problems more probable. "

Also replaced numerous sensors adding up to at least $1500 Had the intake manifold gasket replaced $500 with a class action suite only got $100 back. Now I have to replace the oil pan gasket,it will cost $350. Not to mention the gas milage is nothing close to what they said it would be.  I was told the transmission will be next.

I bought the car with 70,000 and now its at 150+ and I have only had to replace minor bits and pieces that come along with driving a car that much. Brake pads, wheel bearings and a battery once. You don't have to buy a 4 cylinder civic to get good milage. This can get 33 tops on hwy and 21 in the city. I avg. 28 driving through mnt. ranges on cruise. For a 2dr the back seat is spacious for leg room and comfy. I can fit my snowboards and wakeboard in my trunk no problem as well as move all my belongings in the thing.

The cars do have some common problems like leaking intake gaskets, failing window switches, and blower motor resistor failures but it's just general repairs. The drivetrain is overall extremely reliable and it is very common for these to hit 200k+ miles. The overall performance, style, gas mileage, features, reliability, and practicality make its pros far out weigh its cons. People who post on here about reliability issues with the motors in these cars are insane. Most of what people list are general maintenance. The 3800 is a very proven motor "

This car is not only a sleeper, it gets gas mileage in the range of Japanese cars but it has 280 pounds of torque to play with.  True, the interior plastic parts could have been better, but the mechanical failures of my brother's Accord make me glad I bought a Pontiac.  The GTP is well-known for long-term reliability and most of the negative posts you see here are not representative of the total population.  I had a GM 3.8 liter with 250,000 miles and not a single mechanical issue.  Don't doubt Pontiac's build quality or engineering, these cars are a steal @ <$10K!"

I couldn't even feel a difference.  I've
only have a few minor problems with my

For the first three years I've had it, it gave me no problems and I like the way it looks, especially in black, sleek and sinister, the fog lamps, spoilers, and dual exhausts don't hurt either. It was pretty fast and fuel efficient, but it turned into a piece of crap once it had 115,000 miles on it. The windshield wipers stick up when they're turned off, the tail-break lights don't work, you could time it's acceleration to highway speed with a calendar, the windows don't work, and it guzzles gas like a V8.

it cuts into the old average. I have 
had mpg as high as 37, but other times 
we experienced 22 (winter months town

The engine is rock solid, but there 
seems to be some excessive noise coming 
from the alternator. I have heard this

be a problem, just is a little noisy

Suddenly the motor mount went bad.  (Supercharged models use one less mount) which caused front axle boot to go.  While it was apart replaced water pump which was still OK.

The interior has cheap plastic.  I only got to put 8000 miles on it when there were too many problems to list in order to fix this chunk of metal GM called a car.  It did run fairly well.

much legroom in the front passenger

together when legs were fully 
extended).  I am only 6', so maybe 
that had something to do with it, but 
it shouldn't.  Then the doors locked 
and the PLASTIC locking mechanism 
nearly fell off.  You could see back 
inside the door panel.  The VERY cheap 
interior plastics are unacceptable on 
a $20k+ car.  Also, with only 2,154

I've had a few issues over the last 4 years with it needed a new sway bar, steering rack, shocks, head gasket, intake gaskets. I've had many vehicles with far less miles on them and far more problems. Even after it all the car was worth fixing the amount of fun the car offers far out weights the cost(did the repairs myself cost about $1200).

pontiac,grand-prix,2002,Lastone1, 08/26/2002,I love my new car!,4,"Granted, I don't know much about 
cars...but I have been driving this car 
for almost a year and it has been 
wonderful. The ride is smooth and 
comfortable for the long drive I have 
to work. I don't think that I can ever 
buy a car without Heads Up Display 
again. I no longer have to look down 
when changing my speed...or my radio 
controls. Also, the car has so many 
more features than any other for your 
dollar. The only problems are watching 
speed...a smooth ride makes you forget 
how fast you're going and hitting the 
breaks on a heavy car like this means 
you have to leave quite a bit of 
stopping distance!"
pontiac,grand-prix,2002,Jason De Smit, 08/31/2002,My GTP,4,"Excellent car, for the price, you 
really can't ask for anything more.
There are a couple of minor things that 
I don't particularly care for. But the 
rest of the car definitely makes up for 
it. It's rather powerful engines makes 
driving VERY fun and exciting. And it 
handles very smoothly!"
pontiac,grand-prix,2002,RdRydnHd, 09/26/2002,Lovin' It!!!,4,"The 1999 Grand Am was the first car I 
ever owned...went with the intention of 
buying the Grand Prix and am so happy I 
went back and did it!! The cars 
performance is great, no problems, no 
issues. As a female above average 
height, 5'10 I'm thrilled with the leg 
room. Every other car I test drove 
included some SUV's, my knee hit the 
steering wheel each time I went for the 
brake. It's roomy and I find it 
extremely comfortable yet it's still 
fun to take out for a ride on the 
highway!"
pontiac,grand-prix,2002,Ghengis, 09/30/2002,Underestimated,5,"Under valued for its performance and 
raw appeal.  The GTP has everything a 
yupie could want and your teenage 
son."
pontiac,grand-prix,2002,cudaboy2, 10/09/2002,Back in a GTP,5,"I was in a roll over accident in my 
previous 2000 GTP and survived with 
only a bruised arm.  It gets my 
thumbs up on safety.  I expect to have 
the same trouble-free reliability as 
my previous 2000 GTP. Love the new 
OnStar option.  I am completely 
satisfied with this car. Can't wait for 
the new 2004's to come out, though I 
might switch to the GTO."
pontiac,grand-prix,2002,donnac, 02/07/2008,Awesome reliable car,4,"I owned this car for 2.5 years and put 45,000 miles on it with no problems (other than catalytic converter fixed under warranty).  When I traded it in, it still had the original brakes with 75% pads left!  I never even had to have an alignment!  The only things I ever had to do to the car were oil, tires, and wiper blade changes.  I did change the spark plugs at 50,000 miles, but only because I wanted to, it didn't need it.  Totally amazing reliability for an American built car.  Awesome looks, car ran great, I would highly recommend this car to anyone. "
pontiac,grand-prix,2002,Billy, 04/03/2002,excellent,5,EXCELLENT CAR!!
pontiac,grand-prix,2002,Karen, 06/02/2002,Great dependable fun car!,4,"I have a 98' Pontiac Grand Prix with 
117,000 miles.  No problems with this 
car.  Fun to drive and turns heads.  
Only complaint is the headrests on the 
front seats, they definitely need 
redesigned.  Other than that, a great 
car."
pontiac,grand-prix,2002,new car owner, 11/25/2002,So far So good,4,"I bought this car with the notion that 
GM products suck. But I couldn't pass 
the deal that I could get on this 
vehicle. I like the car a lot and have 
had no problems so far. The only 
concern I do have is on Fuel economy. 
The sticker says 19/29. So far it has 
been about 16.5 city and 24 hwy. Not 
what I was expecting."
pontiac,grand-prix,2002,Scarface, 11/27/2002,AMAZING CAR!!!,5,"I bought this car used in August and I 
absolutly love it.  It has great power 
when you need it but gets excellect 
milage when you are easy on the gas and 
best of all, it looks AWESOME!!  I 
recommend this car to anyone who wants 
a decent size car that is quite quick 
and not as cheap feeling as the smaller 
compacts."
pontiac,grand-prix,2002,GTPMAN, 11/29/2002,2002 GTP,4,"I think this veicle is a really nice 
car it perfores really well i brought 
it to the track several times and at 
first i was geting 14.9 but then after 
it got broke in and it was a little 
coller out i was running 14.2 at 98 
miles an hour bone stock. now i grew up 
going to the track every weekend and iv 
never seen a stock V6 no less run a 14.2"
pontiac,grand-prix,2002,CUEVAS, 02/28/2002,mecham,4,"    This vehicle is a supercar on racing it gives out an outstanding performance when it come for take off and racing.

   It's also very comfortable from the interior (the seats, a/c radio/cdplayer) and the most important part of this vehicle is that you can make some modification to the gtp (illuminate your gages, upgrade your system) and all this details won't cost you a thing."
pontiac,grand-prix,2002,Adam Blayton, 12/11/2002,"Good overall, just needs less plastic",4,"Great car, had 99 Grand Am which was 
totaled, wanted new pontiac. Love the 
looks, plenty of power with 3.8l 200hp. 
After owning a VW, the difference in 
interior quality is very apparent. 
Pontiac interior is nice, but needs to 
lose the plastic feel, nothing wront 
with plastic, but in moderation!"
pontiac,grand-prix,2002,JHD, 12/11/2002,Everything you'd want in an American car,4,"I decided to buy the loaded GTP as soon 
as I test drove the vehicle. Since this 
was my first new car, I did quite a bit 
of market research.  Sure the Nissan 
looked great.  Sure the Honda looked 
great.  But I'm from Detroit and 
foreign cars just don't cut it in this 
town.  This car has everything I could 
possibly want. Lots power, great looks, 
and terrific handling in rain and snow. 
On top of everything else, I feel proud 
to support America by buying American 
products.  God Bless the USA.  I'd also 
like to thank Edmunds.com for all the 
great information they supplied to make 
my car shopping easy. This site is 
great!  Keep up the good work."
pontiac,grand-prix,2002,sonnyphysh, 01/05/2003,nothing but comfort,3,"I bought a 2002 Grand Prix SE. I do 
alot of long distance road trips, and 
this seemed to be the ideal car for the 
bucks.Very comfortable on the long 
runs, with plenty of cargo room. This 
SE model has the 3.1 engine, which is 
pretty sluggish with 3 average persons 
in the car. Engine noises a month after 
my puchase( needs pistons ). Thats a 
bad start, for a car loan. I should 
have bought the GT with the 3.8L, or 
just stayed away from Pontiac all 
together.Stay away from the SE models."
pontiac,grand-prix,2002,TheRookGRIMM, 01/09/2003,Beats the Mustang GT,5,"My wife owned a Grand Prix GTP and she 
traded it in on a Mustang GT 
convertable. She misses her Grand Prix 
so she drives my 40th Anniversary GTP 
regularly. If they made a Grand Prix 
convertable she would never have bought 
the Mustang. By the way when we both 
opened them up on the freeway my 4 DR 
Full size sedan 240 HP Supercharged GTP 
engine stayed right with her compact 2 
DR convertable V-8 260 HP GT. I am sure 
if added a couple of the available kits 
I would be blowing away most the hot 
cars. I have to laugh at the Honda's 
with their big exhaust pipes thinking 
they can keep up."
pontiac,grand-prix,2002,TheRook, 01/09/2003,Best full size sedan for the money,5,"It is time foreign car buyers take a 
look at the Pontiac Grand Prix. 
I have owned three and they have been 
as reliable as any German or Japanese 
car I owned. I think that 
the Japanese cars are overrated and 
overpriced. A GP is under $30,000 and 
yet it has many features you will not 
find on higher priced cars. The 240 HP 
supercharged engine six gives plenty of 
power but it also gives great gas 
mileage. The GTP has leather 
seats, heads-up display, chromatic 
mirror, computer to indicate 
warnings, gas mileage, oil life, and 
more. The ride is very comfortable and 
quiet. The wide track makes you feel 
secure even on wet or slick surfaces."
pontiac,grand-prix,2002,Ronaldo, 03/01/2002,97 GT Sedan,4,"I've got over 80k miles on my '97 GT Sedan. Rack and pinion assembly had to be replaced at about 50k. Some occasional minor rattling in the dash and an annoyingly short range for the keyless remotes that several dealers were unable to fix since the car was new. Other than that the car is great and I may buy another one when they redesign it possibly next model year. 3800 V6 drivetrain is fantastic, plenty of reliable power, easy to work on too."
pontiac,grand-prix,2002,blaze5222, 08/01/2011,Best thing since sliced bread,4,"I just bought my wife a 02 grand prix gt.... and it rocks.... sure since it is used and has about 65000 miles on it.... there are a few minor issues... but for a used car, I never would have thought I would feel safe sending my wife the 150 miles to the beach without me.."
pontiac,grand-prix,2002,oldies4me, 04/14/2011,We've had ours for 8 years now..,4,"Still low miles, but we can really Haul in it- we should have a SUV!- I mean 25 gal water, a cooler, tools, clothes, bedding, two dog kennels (in back seat of course!) and other stuff for going to our lakelot half the summer.. We had experience with the 3.1 v6 in a Corsica which went well over 100000 miles,; this one has about 80000 so far (retired; don't drive a lot anymore).. The nice surprise was fuel economy- 37 on a trip going 65-75 mph most of the way. Solid, great handling, loves to cruise at 70+.. Trouble? None- just did brakes first time. 
If I could find a cherry GTP coupe I'd keep it as a collectible!"
pontiac,grand-prix,2002,dcharger, 03/24/2011,600 miles to a full tank of gas,3,"love the car, got 209,000 miles on it now,,car was great on gas, but now have trans problem, and some motor problem, but after running it and dumping money in it, i still like it,, but like everything, it dont last forever, smooth ride, never cared for GMs, but this was the only good car i think they made, well thats that"
pontiac,grand-prix,2002,Johnny Grapes, 09/23/2003,40th Anniversary Winner!,4,"An excellent vehicle on all fronts.
Great styling, handlng, supercharger
kicks in nice and smooth with a steady
excelleration, much more so than that of
a turbo. Dark Cherry paint and interior
two tone nice touches. Best of all is
the braking system, which is the BEST I
have ever driven. No complaints with the
MPG as I am averaging 26mpg highway, and
20city."
pontiac,grand-prix,2002,Binnsky, 10/13/2003,Comfort and style,4,"This is a wonderful car.  Coming up on 
our two year anniversary with this car 
without a problem.  Can't believe all 
we've needed to do is change the oil 
and rotate the tires. We usually trade 
every three years or so, but have no 
plans to sell this one - don't like 
the looks of the new model anyway.   "
pontiac,grand-prix,2002,Don Richmond, 03/25/2005,"Power, Performance and Style",5,"I am a driver in my mid 40's.  I guess I've become bored with the average sedan.  Looking for something a little different.  This is it!  This gives me the sporty look I wanted, the power to get there fast, and the comfort I desired.  The car is loaded.  The 2002 Pontiac Grand Prix GTP has great acceleration and has lots of toys. The salesperson pointed out the Eyecue Heads up Display.  He informed me the GM had bought out Hughes Aircraft back in the 80's.  Hughes makes the F-16 fighter jet.  He asked if I had ever seen Tom Cruise in Top Gun.  I said sure.  Well remember when the jet information was projected onto his windshield .... check this out..the same technology was in my Grand Prix!"
pontiac,grand-prix,2002,Scott Allen, 11/14/2003,Very good vehicle overall,4,"This car has been very good thus far.  
The engine is strong and will move the 
car well when pushed.  The steering and 
suspension are tight, although the car 
will float at times over major 
undulations in the pavement.  The only 
downside to having a motor with this 
much torque is that it does have a 
degree of torque steer.  That and a few 
squeeks and rattles (that only appear 
on rough pavement) are the only real 
issues that I have with the car.  Other 
than that, this car has been very good."
pontiac,grand-prix,2002,vickie, 06/29/2005,2002 Grand Prix,4,Wonderful car to drive. Wider is better.  Needed something that holds 2 sets of golf clubs - they fit in the trunk very comfortably with space to spare.  Also wanted something sporty that handles well - not ready for a Grandma car.  But I have a problem with the reliability of the car.  Transmission went out after 2 years resulting in major repair (under warranty).  And driver's side window quit working consistently after nearly 3 years (barely under warranty).  
pontiac,grand-prix,2002,CCrain, 07/25/2005,Fun Ride,4,"The first year I owned this car it was used as a daily driver.  Now I have a company take-home so my GTP sits in the garage.  The few times that I do drive this car are a blast.  Car has good pick-up and is able to merge with no problems at all.  The trouble I have had from ths car is both head gaskets had to be replaced, seems to be a common thing with 3.8's and the passenger side window does not want to work sometimes.  Other than that, car has been a real pleasure to own and drive."

and after doing some research, I 
decided to order a 40th anniversary 
edition. Ordered in August of 2001, 
following my order through production, 
it finally arrived in November of 2001. 
Always a head turner, I only know of 
one other in the state of Delaware. It 
has been a pleasure to drive (been to 
Texas 3X) and gas milage is exceptional 
considering the engine size and 
supercharger. It came fully loaded, but 
I did get the optional heated seat and 
sunroof. Surprisingly, these are the 
only items that have needed repair, and 
fortunately covered under warranty. "
pontiac,grand-prix,2002,Bethany H., 04/06/2006,Sharp Car!,4,"I just bought my new 2002 Pontiac Grand Prix GT coupe yesterday and I am in love! ;-) This is not the first Grand Prix I've had though and every time, they have been very reliable, a blast to drive, the factory sound system alone is great, and of course, what a beautiful car!  To anyone who is looking into getting a Grand Prix, I would definitely suggest it.  "
pontiac,grand-prix,2002,66GTO, 03/07/2004,Nice package,4,"My GTP is the Anniversary edition. I 
also own a 1997 GTP sedan which has 
150,000 miles. That car is bullet 
proof. Only repairs were alternator and 
power window motor. Both covered under

2002 is a coupe and it has been

reliable car I've ever owned!  My Acura 
TL was the most fun, but even that had 
minor problems.  I also had a Mercedes 
which had it's share of annoying 
maintenence issues.  I've done nothing

can't express how impressed I am by the 
overall quality of this product!"

trips, hauling things with the fold 
down back seat, cool looking ""mom"" car 
yet luxurious at the same time.  
Couldn't get a better car for the price

It was a wonderful car - great pickup, good in the snow, roomy inside, big trunk, good sound system & overall fun to drive!  I had to have a few items replaced near the end of my lease (water pump, door hinge, entire new sunroof) - but nothing was earth shattering & all was covered under the warranty.  I would have purchased it when my lease was over but the price GM wanted me to pay was $3,000 over blue book value!!! Wake up GM!!!"

This is an excellent vehicle to own.  "
pontiac,grand-prix,2002,Tina Burke, 08/02/2005,Typical GM product,3,"I owned a 1979 Grand prix and it was an awesome car...They should build them like they used to. I switched to chevrolet after bad experiences with other GM vehicles (firebirds)and after I totaled (not my fault) my camaro I decided I wanted a larger safer car so I bought my 2002 Grand Prix SE.. It is a good riding car but uncomfortable to ride in. The seats should be softer and should hug your body more. I was just hit with an unexpected but obvious problem with the Grand Prix. The bearings went out on my front driver side at 68,000 miles and cost me over $500 to repair. From what I was told by several repair shops this is a COMMON problem with these cars. Seems GM has some work to do!!!! "
pontiac,grand-prix,2002,Gary C, 08/21/2005,Best Looking Car on the Road,5,"I think the 2002 Grand Prix competes with the big boys in looks.  Actually, I like the design better than the later model design.  It also added the 2002 Nascar championship to its resume. What really amazed me about my car with the 3.1 was that I got 33 mpg in pure interstate driving coming home from the dealer.  In five mileage checks, I averaged 26 in town.      I could not be more pleased with performance.  The comfort level is very good especially with the four way driver seat control.  I was not used to having automatic controls on everything and that is really nice.  The security system is also a nice plus.    "

It is an awesome car and I am proud to own a Pontiac considering I was a Chevrolet Monte carlo person. The Pontiac Gran Prix is the best car made and I would not trade it for anything. The gas mileage I get is amazing. I will buy another one and highly recommend this car to anyone looking to buy a car."

pontiac,grand-prix,2002,Brandee Benson, 01/08/2007,Great Car; Nice ride,4,"This is an overall great vehicle to own. I have been happy with mine for the 4+ years that I have owned it. I bought it new and have taken good care with maintenance, etc. I get about 30 miles/gal. Things to look for: leak in through vent under the hood by windshield. The gasket just needs to be placed better (cost $25 to fix). It needed new computer part for the heater mechanism at about 40000 miles. Needed to replace wiper motor at about 50000 miles, needed new ABS sensors around 70000 miles. Other than that it has been regular maintenance. If you are looking for a good looking car, good gas mileage, great get-up-and-go, and some roomy interior, this car is for you!"

of excellent performance from the supercharged engine.  I have not been dissapointed
after almost 10000 miles.  Overall, this would be an excellent vehicle for someone more concerned about performance
than rock-solid craftsmanship."
pontiac,grand-prix,2002,samstinks, 06/10/2007,A Big Mistake,3,"My husband and I shopped and shopped before deciding to buy this car and despite our careful planning, we made a poor decision. At 20k, I had to have it towed due to a malfunctioning anti- theft device that cut the fuel after 10 seconds. That, at least was under warranty. At 25k, I had to replace my front wheel bearings; a $500 repair. At 56k, both my intake manifold gaskets blew out - $700. Six months later, my head gaskets are blown and the heads possibly damaged from the heat. I commute 25 miles one way to work in it every day, and have had only dealer repairs on it. I've taken care of this car by the book, but it is a horrible car and I can't wait to trade it in."

Did you know doing custom work on your car like that voids your warranty?  
What about a Mustang Saleen S351?  A nice supercharged V8 muscle car!  All for the low price of 56,000 dollars.  Over 2 times the price of a GTP.  For what?  2 cylinders and a bigger supercharger?  Big whoop.  56 grand is a 2 year old Viper.  Or a Z06.

You need to learn about cars before you rate them."
pontiac,grand-prix,2002,Tara, 03/09/2002,Never own one again,3,"I am a 17 yr. old female and bought my 2002 off the showroom floor. The biggest mistake I have ever made was buying that car. Yes it looks nice and will get on it but I will never buy a Pontiac again. After the first 1,000 miles it does not run the same. My horn has the tendency to go off without me pushing it. There are all kinds of sounds coming from the panels. I work at a Ford dealership and I have never seen a vehicle cheaper built than Pontiacs. I will be switching back to ford this year."

noise at 25000 miles, The dealer said 
the pistons need to be replaced, and 
this is common in this model of car.Who 
needs to buy a new car  and have this 
kind of problem right off the bat??? I

I am most pleased with the vehicle.  It is full of new features that appear on many of the same class and luxury cars, HUD, 
Leather seats, sun roof, bose sound system, and now in many GM cars: OnStar.
The gas milage is better than they publish at 25.5 city / 33.2 hwy.  Perhaps this will lower with time."

So far we love the car.  We compared it to many other models, even the Jag X-type.  But dollar for dollar, it seemed like the best value.  So far we don't regret that decision.  The car has plenty of power (we didn't go with the GTP becuase of the 93 octane gas requirement).  This car handles well, accelerates very well and has plenty of interior room.  Once we fot used to it, we find the heads up display very useful.  Keeps reminding you of your speed.  We wouls strongly recommend this car."

It was clear that it had some adventures before I bought it but I needed a car quick. Was  pleasantly surprised when I did a road trip and got 31 miles per gallon - not bad for the 3.1 V6 Living in the North Country where winter can last 6 months and commuting 95 miles a day hasd put this car to the test. The biggesdt problem has been the wheel bearings. Luckily I am able to replace them myself- have done all 4 of them. Had a LITTLE  trouble the first winter withthe security system shutting off the car after 10 seconds. On the internet I found a module that allowed me to bypass the security system and it has been starting great ever since. Now with 189000+ miles on it I am replaceing the car with another Pontiac Grand Prix. I just bought a 2007 withthe 3.8 V6. Am looking forward to another great Pontiac.

I had some repairs, the normal. wheel bearing assemblies,intake gaskets,etc. i got a clue for everyone that hates repair bills. Buy extended warranties. Learn how to fix small things on your car. I myself have begun modifications to it. I can honestly say my Grand Prix is unique. And everyone that complains about repair bills, try the other companies. I work at a dealership, working on Saabs. I know about things on the inside. If you think a few thousand dollars is bad over several years. Saabs are thousands of dollars in one repair bill... Honestly people, American cars are great"

I made it to 164k miles with no major problems until now. The biggest thing I needed work on was a catalytic converter. I had minor leaking of antifreeze and I found out it was due to the plastic intake mannifold. I guess GM cheaped out when they used plastic and that part cracks easy. MY antifreeze leaks more now and the heating panel is shot. Like I said, I put an extra 114k miles on it over 6.5 years. It did me well."

We had a 1999 gtp, and our lease was about up. So I went hunting after 2weeks of calling all over so. Cal I found a dealership that had one with all the options. I have had literally hundreds of compliments about it. The special edition package for the extra money is so worth it other than the loss of the (psm) performance shift mechanism, and the digital thermostat air/heat I luvd' the can, it performed excellent just like my 1999            "

pontiac,grand-prix,2002,Vance, 10/02/2018,Repairs cost more than the car,2,"So this car was recommended to me by my father. After owning it for about a month the radiator went out. That cost me my job. And then about three months after that the master cylinder broke so I was in danger until I could get it repaired. The gas meter doesn't work, there is no aux cord and the speakers sound too terrible, there is currently another issue that I've spent $300 on and it hasn't been repaired. The acceleration is basically non-existent and the revs stop at about two and a half thousand. I bought this car for about 1300. And since then have spent 1600 on repairs. I wish this car had never come into my life. But if it didn't have those costly issues I would have like it. It's big and strong and comfortable.

I bought this car with 94K miles for under $5K.
I am very handy with a wrench ( I actually used to be a mechanic ), but this car is absolutely horrid to work on in the driveway.
It is simply not made to be serviced outside of a professional shop environment.
A great car, just be prepared to spend all day for seemingly simple repair jobs OR actually break down and drop it off at a shop for repairs.
Other than that, the car is great.
I have spent ~$1500 in a year and a half for repairs thus far. Remember, even tho the L67 is bulletproof, the outside accessories and sensors have a shelf life and will fail eventually.
This goes for all cars."

Handling is very responsive (kind of like the Camaro LT I use to have). Ride is firm and sporty. At 68K mi. it has a few minor imperfections, but hey, Ive been driving a 92 Chevy pickup with a stick for 12.5 years so this car feels like a Vette. I was glad to find out that the engine has a timing chain, no belt. Lots of fun to drive with dead straight tracking. I find myself taking the long way home. The stereo sounds great & the seats are comfortable. Overall, it's a really nice ride for not a lot of money. If you want a great car for $5 to $6k check one out. "

pontiac,grand-prix,2003,partsman99, 04/24/2012,This car has changed my views of GM,3,"I bought this car with 71K miles on it in 2009. The clock currently shows 137K, and I am fairly impressed with it. Starts every time I put the key in, no matter how hot or cold it is. The good: plenty of power with the standard 3.8, decent sound system, good fuel economy with the size of the car, the overall look of the car is pleasing to the eye. The bad: needed intake manifold and gaskets right at 100K, a solenoid in the trans is going bad, low roof line so my head is almost rubbing the ceiling (I'm 6'1""), very picky about which alternator is in it.
My overall opinion is this is a good car, and that takes a lot for me to say being a die-hard Mopar fan. It's old, and people still like it."
pontiac,grand-prix,2003,am_can_drift, 04/21/2015,Good First Car,4,"This was my first car. By the time I got it, it had 185k miles on it. The struts were already bad, and it ran great. This car was a classic new-age Pontiac in that the electronics inside broke, but it held together under the hood. (the gas flotation device broke, inside dashboard lights went out partway). I had very few problems under the hood with this car. It ran in all conditions, and it carried the workload. Eventually, the head gasket blew and the trans started to go bad at 215k miles. Between service records and me, these were the first problems under the hood. It is a great first car in that it can take quite a beating. I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a first car.

pontiac,grand-prix,2003,Danny, 05/03/2008,Excellent Car!,4,"As soon as I drove away, I was blown away! For the small of the two engines, the 3100S definitely provides impressive power and response. Quick off a stop and maintains speed effortlessly.  4 speed is definitely the way to go with this car, which shifts quite smoothly I might add.  Phenomenal highway car as well, especially when it makes 30+ mpg! Not bad around the city either, I average between 22-25 mpg.  The engine sounds great when the car is winding out too, without losing gas needlessly.  All in all it is a supremely well balanced car in terms of performance, style, efficiency, and overall intrigue of the vehicle. I got mine used with low miles & never been happier behind the wheel."

Couldn't bare to pay close to 20k for an new econobox, so bought the last of this generation in 2007 for half that. It is a comfortable muscle car. Acceleration and long distance cruising are its forte. Handling is okay but sloppy when really pushed. The transmission does this clunk at times when starting from a stop?? The ""leather"" is more like vinyl and the rear seats are not adult comfortable over the long haul. The hvac  setting doesn't work in the first 2 positions. The brakes fade under repeated hard use. A 5 speed [m]transmission would have made this car much quicker. 15 mpg city 26 mpg hwy. Feels solid but fat."

this car already before I bought it.  I 
was right.  The 240HP supercharged 
engine has great power and the interior 
with full options with leather seats is 
awesome.  The exterior on a GTP is also 
nicer than on the basic SE model on the 
front end of the model.  With the 
options, the car has it all when it 
comes to comfort.  Also for 23k the car 
is very well priced when compared to 
other mid-size sedans that cost about 
27k through 30k with about the same

pontiac,grand-prix,2003,Gary Keister, 08/29/2008,Never buy another Pontiac,3,"Let's start out by saying I have been a Chevy/gm person my whole life and grew up in a family the same way. However I am so disappointed in my grand prix at the constant repairs with such low mileage. At 20,000 had the transmission pulled and repaired along with a wiring harness. Soon after the car had a very bad oil leak. Now at 57,000 the abs light is on water pump needs replacing. I have coolant running out and will cost me around $800 because the labor is long . GM decided to make you tear 1/2 the engine apart to do this job. I never thought I would drive anything but gm but I am going to do the thing that bothers me most, buy foreign."
pontiac,grand-prix,2003,save the brand, 07/17/2009,great American design and quality,4,"I have never been sorry I bought this GM product.Overall reliability has been excellent.The engine has good power and good fuel economy,and it SOUNDS like a real engine. The handling with the low profile tires and alloy wheels is excellent. Ride quality is very good,a bit on the firm side,w/good road feel. This car has never had a 4 wheel alignment and tracks straight as an arrow. No probs with the with the exhaust,battery,or even a belt!I have replaced only 2 components- the gas cap and the blower motor resistor(that was a tough do-it-yourself-job, but I managed).The fit and finish is very good,with virtually no squeaks or rattles in 5+years. &I know my wife is safe in it.I would buy again."

Totally love the car, driving is never boring, and the acceleration is fantastic. Some minor repairs: brakes, thermostat, and a few other things, but nothing major. Sometimes I think about buying a new car, but I don't think there is one out there with this quality and this much fun to drive. Still looks great!"

The same day we bought it we went through a fast-food drive-thru & the lady working at the window was craning her head out to see what kind of car it was. She said ""Oh I'm sorry; I'm just trying to see what kind of car this is."" We told her & she said ""WOW! This is NICE!"" This car has been well-maintained & we see no reason that w/proper care/maintenance that it couldn't easily go to 200K.

Her first big test was when I got a dui because my dumb ass was flying down a dirt road. I sideswiped a sign, lost control, and flew through a barbed wire fence into a deep field of mud. It sounded like it was supercharged for a minute till i found out i had to replace the water pump. After doing so it runs smooth and is still sexy and sleek."
pontiac,grand-prix,2003,Mark Stanfield, 03/05/2017,Love my car,5,"After chatting with several other Grand Prix owners, I wish they would do something about the transmission issues we are all having. Starting out, if too much gas, the shift doesnt happen, but if babied, its more reliable to shift into second. Adding an additive called lubegard, the sticky shift solenoid went away. There are a lot of people who have the same issue that need to be made aware of this product so they won't spend thousands on a new transmission.Update: 198000 miles; this car has become my Uber car, and now next year, it will be considered too old. The problem with the transmission turned out to be sticky solenoid. I found a very reliable product to add to the transmission fluid. That product is Lube Gard Premium. It saved me from having to either sell the car or spend a costly repair bill at a repair shop. I hate to say but I will be parting ways with my car. I need something newer to continue Ubering.

It's really hard to find those with other cars nowadays. The GM 3.8 is an amazing motor. Going down the highway I get 30 mpg easily, which is amazing given the size of the car. Whenever a friend of mine gets into my car, their immediate reaction is, ""wow, this is a solid car"".

This one of the best cars I have ever owned. I have been driving it every day for the last 2 years 80 miles round trip to work. it now has 148,000 on it and it's still a great car.

Soon after had to replace tie rods, brakes found leaks in the coolant tank and power steering reservoirs. Got them all replaced at around 5k, now the car runs like smooth as silk. Even now i get a thrill out of an early morning acceleration rush. the a/c brings temperatures to polar regions in the peak Texan summer effortlessly.

I am now looking to retire her with 220 plus.
Overall she's been very reliable but this car does have some design flaws.
Rainstorms are not its friend.
Water runs down into the AC system and I had to have the heater box replaced.
The blower began sticking on last year, got it fixed and didn't last.
The AC system has now burned up in it completely and I'm not getting it fixed.
The floors will also get soaked in heavy rain which is really strange.
The backseat is too cramped but the trunk is the size of Nebraska.

I never drove it hard but I bought the car with 27,000 miles on it every now and then it would hesitate before it went into gear but always ran fine once you got going, could not believe it went out so soon.I was hoping to get at least 100,000 miles out of it.It always ran fine as far as the motor goes but the transmission has serious issues.

I have not had to have any major service done on it, ever.
I have had to replace normal wear and tear items like brake pads or rotors, and have oddball issues that occur still.
The fuel pump seal is bad so when the car sits for a bit the fuel drains down the line.
Turn the key to ON a couple of times before going to START and you're fine.
Exhaust sound is outstanding, handling is great, and power is nice but a little lacking by today's standards.
Fit and finish is OK but kind of bland and cheap looking.

Got the GTP and it still accelerates like a champ and handles very well.
I'm pleased with the interior with easy to use controls, plus it fits me like a glove.
This car is big but doesn't feel too big like our Chevy Monte Carlo.
Excellent factory stereo, heads up display that should be in every vehicle and a reliable 3.8 engine.
The paint still sparkles, the chrome wheels look great and the body style isn't embarrassing for a 10 year old car.
The problems I've experienced are a recurring problem with the traction control and body squeaks that drive me crazy.
Too much plastic in the interior."

Watch your temperature gauge for any increase in heat and monitor your coolant levels.
I just experienced the worse case scenario when driving on the freeway and suddenly getting the ping informing me to shut down AC due to engine overheating.
4200.00 later valves had to be replaced and head gaskets machined in addition to much more.

I have owned other Pontiacs but I always wanted a Grand Prix and this car has not disappointed. Performance was unrivaled having tested other cars of similar size and price. Exhaust note and exterior looks make this more like a sports car than a four door sedan. If you load the car up with all the bells and whistles, you will find it to be one of the best deals around. Great job GM. As far as negatives go, this car has been spotless in the mechanical reliability department but I did have pin hole leak in the trunk and one interior rattle. Both issues were fixed without question by a great service departmen"

pontiac,grand-prix,2004,Michelle, 12/08/2015,Loved it while I had it,5,"A few years ago I was in a tight spot and had to replace my car ASAP because it had been totaled and I was allowed to have it for three days  to ""drive within daylight hours in the local area"" so that I could replace my car.

Enter the orange 2004 Pontiac GTP.  I bought it used, with over 130k miles on it.  That was the best car I ever had! I loved it until I had to part with it recently (traded it in for a Kia Soul - don't judge me! I didn't want to do it but I had to!)

To start, it was lovely all around.  Smooth, sleek, sexy - my friends found it to be an attractive car even if it was something ""older"" than what they had.  I even had a friend that asked if I were to sell it that I come to him first.  Unfortunately I had to part with it after three years, with over 167k miles on it.  Let me tell you a little something about the Pontiac I had.

For the first two years, it held together great.  But this past year it started falling apart.  I replaced the cad. converter, the throttle body, the blower motor, replaced the master window switch and had my muffler fixed (technically that was last year).  I bought this car for around $5k, and just barely got a $1000 for it.  Here's my bottom line to anyone looking to purchase an older Pontiac; be prepared to drop some serious cash into it if it's a GTP.  One of the reasons why I had to part with my beloved car was because on my way to class I broke down on the highway.  A call to a trust worthy mechanic and towman later I found out the computer in the car was going.  Ah-ha~ I thought to myself, so this is they the horn was starting to be picky about when it would sound!  I almost got into an accident because my tires were worn (I didn't know at the time) and when I hydroplaned I nearly caused an accident - had it not been for the squealing tires the other driver would not have been aware of what was going on... because not matter how many times I hit the horn it wouldn't work! (but later it worked in the parking lot)

Over all what I loved about it - it was affordable before it started falling apart.  Comfortable.  The heated seats and sun roof were a plus.  Beautiful color - I haven't seen too many cars pull off the orange exterior as well as the Pontiac.  Looked fantastic with tinted windows.  Great trunk size, V6 engine was great, and it was fun even if it didn't have all of todays bells and whistles (blue tooth, navigation, etc)  I once had to tote around an old man in a wheelchair and what we liked was the seat was leveled with his wheelchair.  Pop a sliding board on the seat and he could just scoot over comfortably.  The back seat might be a tight fit for some people, but I was able to transport a friend (riding shot gun) her two kids (one in a car seat, the other in a booster) plus my basset hound pound puppy.

Downside? If you're in the snowbelt this was not an ideal car.  I crashed twice into a curb in one year because of snowbuild up on the tires.  I managed to bust up a strut and my swaybar.  Some of the parts I needed my mechanic had to go to a junk yard for - which makes me wonder if the first converter that was replaced was a junk yard part.  The backseats are not ideal for tall people.  You'll feel squished and I don't know about others, but I always felt that I was being folded in half sitting back there.  And if you have a GTP, be prepared to shell out some serious $$$ for repairs.  Some of the simplest jobs cost extra for me because of how everything under the hood was arrange.  Oh... and don't ask me why but GM put the power steering fluid down, almost behind the engine! It was very irritating when I had to pop the hood and locate the cap.

All in all, this may make a great summer car for people who want less features and more car.

pontiac,grand-prix,2004,rail81, 02/06/2009,5 Year Follow-up,3,"This is a follow-up review. I wrote one after initial purchase.  Bottom line, GM's got to do better.  The exterior design and discounted price sold us this car and I wish it hadn't.  I now understand what professional car reviewers look for.  The interior design is poor and cheap.  The finish on the steering wheel is peeling and the low glovebox is nearly inaccessible.  The seat side bolsters have worn through and the cheap interior plastic is impossible to clean.  Horrible side/rear visibility.  The engine has been reliable but the transmission now shifts harshly from 1st.  Steering has been repaired twice.  Airbag system acts up.  Neither of our 150K+ mile Fords have had any problems."
pontiac,grand-prix,2004,roger sudut, 07/27/2009,Perfect car in every way,5,"Had this car for 5 years & I still look forward to driving it.For something with such good exceleraton that gets 30.5mpg/24 city who would what a 4 cyl thats not half as fun to drive. I can leave my SUV at home and still haul 8' 2x4's with the folding pass. & rear seats. The only problem in 5 years were a water leak @ On-Star antenna & front seat cover tear.Car is tight,no rattles or wind noise just sorry to see Pontiac going away."
pontiac,grand-prix,2004,2004 Grand Prix, 08/15/2009,Perfect Car,4,"This is my second Grand Prix.  It was definitely worth the upgrade from the 2001 model.  This car has very good power and pickup.  Very comfortable interior and exterior styling.  I've had it a year and a half and just now had my first problem--which was minor.  GM may just have finally figured out their brake problems.  This is my first GM that I haven't had to put brakes on within the first year.  Interior could be built with better quality materials, things tend to wear out easily.  Other than that I would recommend this vehicle to anyone!"
pontiac,grand-prix,2004,Explicit_Spade, 02/28/2010,My 4th GP,4,"This is my fourth Grand Prix, so I may be a little biased, but the quality for the price can't be beat. I have a heavy right foot, and this car has done nothing but perform. Its a large bulky car, however, the advertisement at the time was ""Wider is Better"" and I couldn't agree more. The bold styling turns heads. The interior is made for the driver by drivers, with a cockpit style design. Its the most luxury and power you can get for the price."
pontiac,grand-prix,2004,mike, 02/02/2008,ughhhhhh,4,"The car is a good car looks wise, comfort and design. But i have had qet a few problems like a transmission, throttle body, and traction control, and anti-lock brakes. it don't seem as to how many are out there that they could all have problems but i just got a lemon."
pontiac,grand-prix,2004,mpdcop21, 04/07/2008,vehicle disappointing,2,"I have had my grand prix for more then 2 years now and i have had a constant problem with it. When i bought the car, they took another carfax from another grand prix on the lot and didn't tell me it was a rental car. I have had stalling problems for over a year and now I'm having transmissions problems. Every time I take it to the dealership they can't duplicate the problem! And they charge me more to not diagnose it then it would be to fix it. Now I'm taking my car to Aamco tomorrow to see what they say. It has 80,000 miles on it. The transmission should not be shot yet. But since it was a rental car it just might be. WE all know how we treat rental cars. The transmission is slipping a lot!!!!"
pontiac,grand-prix,2004,Gm guy, 08/04/2018,Best car I've ever owned! Runs forever!,5,"I loved this car!  I bought it used in 2008 and had 43k on it.  I've owned it for 10 years and when I sold it the car had 257k on it.  This car had o e of GM's best engines in it which is the 3800.  This engine got great gas mileage and is known to last a lot of miles.  The car drove very smooth and had great performance for when you wanted to get up and go.  The only reason I sold it was because my work required us to have a car under 10 years old.  Otherwise I would still be driving it.  I sold the car to a friend and he now has over 280k on it.  To this day the grand prix still looks very modern when driving next to newer 2018 models.  If you are looking at purchasing a 2004 to 2008 grand prix I highly recommend it.  Just do regular maintenance on them and they'll last forever!

pontiac,grand-prix,2004,Lance, 11/10/2009,Finally Paid Off,2,"I bought my 2004 with 24,000 miles on it. A factory exhaust system was installed. Good car until the 40,000 mile mark. Took it in for my routine oil change, and was told that there were particles of metal in transmission fluid. I did a trans flush and added Lucas Trans Lube to it. It took 2 full flushes to get all of the metal out of the system. Now at 88,000 miles, I was told, again, by a new mechanic that my trans fluid needs to be changed. The manual calls for 1 trans change at 100,000 miles. This would now make it 3 flushes in 88,000 miles. Check gas cap and check eng light came on at 65,000 miles. Computer says there's a leak in the exhaust manifold. Trading in before I dump money in it."

pontiac,grand-prix,2004,jimmac404, 01/01/2009,Horrible and terrible vehicle,1,"This was the most awful car that was ever purchased by me. From the time I purchased the vehicle to the time I got rid of it, which was 2 months, the car spent more time in the shop than on the road. Lucky for me the dealer attempted to fix all the problems but this car as far as I'm concerned was beyond repairs. First the rear suspension went out, then the air conditioner and finally the car leaked inside from a heavy rainstorm. Pontiac should have went out of business instead of Oldsmobile. Car was traded for a 2005 Chevy Impala which was 10 times better. No Pontiac ever for me!   "

I've been to the service center at least 15 times...im still unhappy.. The enterior is crap..the carpeting is so cheap...The seats are always breaking..ugh...between my car overheating, sunroof leaks, cheap tires and plastic exterior...i give this car a 3 or a scale from 1-10.

pontiac,grand-prix,2004,CEEZR, 10/08/2008,Great Value Grand Prix,1,"I have driven many cars in my life this car has been a great value. Very reliable, excellent fuel economy 25/31MPG, reg gas, I drive 65-70 mph I bought it new from the dealer and has been a very good car and it is a lot of car for the money. Heck over 30 miles per gallon on the highway that's as good as most compacts. I would buy another one. Why buy a Camry? I drove one before the GP and this has been a much better car."
pontiac,grand-prix,2004,Ben, 09/08/2010,My Poor Grand Prix,4,"Like many other cars, this car has its up's and down's. Unfortunately for me, there were more down's than up's. It may be due to the fact that I bought it with 155k miles on it but it still doesn't change the fact that the Grand Prix is not built with quality materials. My car overheated four times within a span of 8 months. I expected the car to last till around 250k miles but I'm gonna trade this bad boy in. Car has decent acceleration but no power after 3500 rpm. And nowadays little 4 cylinders can hang and even outrun this V6 and still get better gas mileage. I suggest getting a GTP or GXP and get those extra horses or else you'll be disappointed just like me. Don't do it to yourself!"

The Grand Prix is by far the best car you can buy for the price. I look forward to my next one. The current car I have is a fusion orange GT2. I've owned it for just over a year and have put 30,000 miles on it. It had 20,000 when I bought it. I haven't had any mechanical issues with the car so far. I've only had it at the dealer once and that was for a splash guard to prevent water getting into the car from the under carrage."

pontiac,grand-prix,2004,Shell, 12/27/2015,LORD HAVE MERCY,2,"I was a 18 year old college student when I bought this car. I bought it and the same week found out it had bad wheel bearings. throughout the year I've had problems with it here and there. it started leaking anti freeze causing my heat not to work. then my motor blew up in it. I had to get a motor from another Pontiac and replace it with mine. not even a month later I was taking a right turn on Main Street and my car wouldn't move. my transmission was falling out of my car!! I did not have these gears; R,D,N,3. that was when (after having the car for 7 months) I gave up. I ended up selling my car for parts because I kept the outside and inside very clean. I ended up getting $400 out of it. but I will never ever get a Pontiac car again. every time I see the same car I had I want to go spit on it"
pontiac,grand-prix,2004,billd, 08/01/2008,be a patriot- buy American excitement,4,"I wish this was a manual trans, but since that isn't possible.  Still, the car is a blast to drive, and still gets about 28 combined highway and city.  I actually like the previous/more curvy style, but this looks nice too.  Large trunk and lots of interior room, but getting in and out of the drivers seat isn't as easy as my van was.  Did i mention just how much fun this is to drive?  I have a 65 gto convertible and a 78 formula firebird that get about the same MPG after years of work, but they still aren't as fun to drive as this one is.  If this was a 4 cylinder turbo with a manual trans it would be the best car i had since my 87 ford t-bird coupe."

pontiac,grand-prix,2004,Mick, 08/27/2008,"Reliable, Fun, American Owned Co.",4,"This was my first new car, I traded in my 1999 Mazda Protege on it.  I absolutely love it.  I keep it clean and get comments all the time on how sharp it is.  I have the CompG package (highly recommended) that stiffens up the rides.  I have no regrets on this purchase. American owned company, the way to buy.  The Heads Up Display is so nice.  Talk about a safety feature, I can change the radio, CDs, cruise, all seeing it on my windshield, so I never take my eyes off the road.  All these control buttons are located on the steering wheel.  The HUD also displays direction and temp.  The supercharger rocks!  I will take this motor over a 260 HP motor w/out a supercharger any day. Hang tight!!  "
pontiac,grand-prix,2004,Duane, 11/13/2008,I loved it when I bought it,3,"As a car guy I really enjoyed this car at first. So far I've had the steering repaired. Recently, the a/c compressor bearing went out. That skewed the belt which put tension where it didn't belong. The alternator, tensioners and compressor all needed replacement. The new compressor (a GM part) has significantly higher sides to keep the belt in place. I've also learned there's a problem with the intake gaskets and some day they'll need replacement. (My wife's '05 Impala already went through this.) GM has some serious quality problems here and it's not just on Pontiac. I hate to say it, but I'll be looking at foreign cars next time I buy and GM can only blame themselves."
pontiac,grand-prix,2004,Steve S., 11/27/2008,One Of The Best All Around Sedans Ever!,5,"The 2004 Grand Prix GTP is one of the best all around cars I have ever owned!  It has the power of a V8, the gas mileage of a 4-6 cyl, handles curves and looks great.  I am a Pontiac enthusiest who loves to drive my cars, I not only drive this car to work everyday (28 miles round trip) and get 23 MPG and 28 MPG highway, but I drive on twisty roads and even around Road Atlanta.  I purchased this car new and just turned over 45,000 miles and have had 3 small problems since new (intermiate shaft greased, a couple of rear defrost lines out and water leak above reading lights).  It has been a great car and I can't say enough about it, very fast, handles, great looks, cool interior and options."
pontiac,grand-prix,2004,weaslespit, 01/26/2009,Fun car to drive without sacrificing MPG,4,"My wife bought this car in October of 2004 and we have enjoyed it every day since. The handling is excellent, acceleration is good and the fold-down rear seats allow for vasts amounts of cargo space when needed.  I also get great MPG (28 average). Edmunds rates that the engine is noisy, but I disagree. You can hear the growl without having to shout over it which is exactly how I think it should sound! I agree with all of the Pro's listed by Edmunds. I wish our car had the HUD as that is the only option that our GP does not have.  Mechanically, our I-shaft experienced 'stick-slip', but it was covered under warranty and was taken care of by the dealer without issue.  No other issues since"
pontiac,grand-prix,2004,scotkris, 03/07/2009,Grand Prix,4,Have driven 25-30K per year and never done anything except routine or preventive maintenance.  This has been the most reliable and best performing vehicle I've owned in 30 years of vehicle ownership.  Can haul a family of 5.  The flat folding passenger seat can allow you to carry items up to 8' in length.

The leather is wearing and I only drive about 3000 miles a year. Stereo is good. Bass is good for a stock cd system Very good handling and control in all weather and the engine can haul a$$ when you need it! The cabin room and design is nice and the trunk is huge (my last car was a Grand Marquis so I'm used to lots of trunk space!)  I would definitely suggest this car

pontiac,grand-prix,2004,M Stiles, 04/20/2009,Great Value,4,"This vehicle attained excellent gas mileage - consistently 30 mpg, not in the low 20's as I was led to believe, and it gave me great satisfaction during the months of $4 per gallon fuel prices. Comfy seats, nice large trunk space and flip-down seats, good control and easy to drive. No major repairs were needed. The negatives: shortage of cupholders, some road noise, red  dashboard lighting. Overall, an excellent vehicle for the average driver.  "
pontiac,grand-prix,2004,Macj, 08/24/2009,Rock of Gibraltar,4,"I bought this car at 6k miles and now its at 64k, I absolutely love it, the engine is a monster and the a/c still causes a polar experience. The sound system is pathetic and a few speakers are torn. In terms of drive quality, this thing really gives me power when I want and offers a majestic cruise experience. Honda and Toyota would have set me back a few more thousand dollars, but I dont see where I lost out with this. One major issue I have is with the seating in the back, its extremely cramped and most ppl have complained of nausea because of the claustrophobic rear styling. Ill keep this one till it dies, my last American car got me 268k, miles to go before she sleeps!  "

I actually get 27-28 MPG in the city and 32 MPG on the highway.  Outstanding vehicle, power in the engine is great.  I love the hauling space with the fold down back seats AND the extra fold back front passenger seat.  This was my first vehicle with traction control and what a difference that made this past winter when I was on black ice and didn't even know it.  This car is  definitely a keeper.

Almost immediately I was unhappy.  The sunroof hesitated for the first 3 years then fixed itself. The front end has been repaired at least 6 times.  It ate a set of tires in 8 month. Tie rods, bushing alignment issues.  The interior stinks:  My 6 foot husband can't get into it, period with out moving the steering wheel and seat. ""leather' is all cracking, wheel is peeling, plastic is impossible to clean.  I miss my 99 in myriad ways.  It was huge, got better mileage.  I HATE leather, especially this leather.

My Grand Prix drives on the highway better that any other car I've owned. My max 8 years old but the handling is way better on the Grand Prix to bad pontiac is gone but maybe they might bring back the Grand Prix. I love the sterio the leather seats and traction control feels like the ground is dry in the rain and snow. I got a good one if your looking for one it's a nice car. I have a 1994 BMW too I thought GM didn't compare I was wrong. My dealer got my to drive it I was hook since it hugs the road like a GT racing car.

As a previous owner of both a Mustang GT and a Dodge Intrepid with a 3.2L V6, this '04 Grand Prix is right between the Mustang and Intrepid in size, so if you would like a sports car feel with room for kids, I highly recommend this car!  Very tight suspension, very responsive. Excellent gas mileage, so far. I got about 24 mpg my first tank of gas in a mix highway/city driving, even while testing the vehicles capabilities. This car will effortlessly respond to any pressure on the accelerator, with seemingly no engine strain. With that said- it will also readily and gladly consume fuel"
pontiac,grand-prix,2004,Carl, 06/09/2010,Old Faithful,4,"Other than the initial recall of the gas pedal assembly when the car was new, I have had no issues with this car in the 6+ years/66k miles I've had it. Other than routine maintenance, I haven't put a dime into what would be considered a ""repair"". It's by no means a ""sports car"", but it is very good at what it's intended to be--a comfortable, quiet, good handling, RELIABLE sedan. And fuel mileage is decent too-- 30 mpg @ 70 mph on long trips/20 mpg stop & go. If it continues to be as good as it's been, I will drive it until the wheels fall off, which should be quite a few years off."

Thankfully, the car has a maxcare warranty from CarMax that's good for 100k miles. The previous owner kept detailed maintenance rec'ds.

She will never leave me stranded :) One down fall i will admit is the back seat. With a tall toddler and being tall myself i have to adjust my seat forward for him to have room. Great mileage since day one. I take great car of my car as well and hope to see 250K before i turn her in. Or maybe i'll keep her and buy a 2008 with low mile's.

4dr that I loved to drive every chance 
I got.  They purchased a 2002 
Bonneville SLE last year, and they 
swear by Pontiac.  I wasn't so sure 
with the first couple of 04's I saw, 
but then I drove one, a GT1, and liked 
it a lot.  We were closing in on a GT2 
with a roof and leather, and then I 
gave in and bought the GTP, and it's 
worth every extra penny.  I've had it 
for 3 days, and let me say I finally 
got the cool car I always wanted in 
high school, only now I'm 30.  So far 
I've challenged a couple of 
newer ""muscle"" cars, and they all wound 
up shaking their heads....  I'm 
definitely a future Pontiac buyer

great, fun to drive, good interior

better ride than the Maxima (which 
costs more) and way ahead of the Audi

the Comp. Group package, and I couldn't 
have been more surprised with the way 
the new car is built. I'm glad to see 
that GM is making headway against the 
foreign brands. The quality seems to be 
much impoved regarding materials and 
rigidity. Nice touches such as the 
waffle pattern head liner, or 
theatrical lighting when entering the 
car. This car feels tight in every 
aspect.  I could go on forever about 
the new Grand Prix, but I won't. Lets 
just hope this is a first of things to 
come from GM."

cockpit like design and the exterior 
without a doubt turns head everywhere.  
It has lots of power when you need but 
purrs so quietly it is easy for 
passengers to sleep on the longer 
drives.  The 'wide' design of the car 
makes it steering and handling on the 
road comfortable at any speed and the 
interior is spacious. I recommend this 
car to anyone who wants a sporty car as

class!!!!!!"

car is comfortable and the styling is 
pure Pontiac- which is not bland! I 
have not had to return to the dealer 
for any problems-San Antonio is a very 
compettive mkt. for car sales. I 
answered an ad for $4,000 off retail

If you can get past the poor quality

the vehicle, but I would have enjoyed 
it more if it were rear wheel drive.  
The GTP has more power than a front 
wheel drive vehicle can handle.  That 
said, this car is still fun to drive.  
The gas pedal response is great. I get 
a lot of compliments about the style 
both inside and out.  I wanted a 
Infinity G35, but now I have a new car 
and money to finish my basement. I did 
take a little hit in performance, but 
not a whole room full of furniture

luxury and performance and luxury. To 
be honest-I bought the car for ME! When 
you slide behind the wheel, you almost 
feel like you're in the cockpit of an

you, for the money, I'm 100% satisified

without them, sorta like the 35 aniv T-
bird SC rims, it just goes together.  I 
can't accurately tell about reliability 
at this point.  But I can go over my 
first thoughts.  The interior sets 
low.  Its a sports car, accept it.  On 
rough roads there is some interior 
noise.  Its a sports car, accept it.  I 
completely walked away from a BMW 330i

regretting it. Its a good car, but 
when commuting two hours/day, some 
things I dont like.
The seats are uncomfortable in shoulder 
width. I dont have wide shoulders, but 
only one fits in the center part of the 
seat. The other is on the bolsters. 
Wearing down the cushion may help.
Im too high. Cant believe that seat 
doesn't go lower. When I put the visor 
down, it blocks my view. Im 5'6""
Getting in/out is more difficult than 
in my Civic. The steering wheel gets in 
the way.
Great power.
HVAC good, but back window fogs. 
Back window is difficult to see out of

Already had serviced a few 
times. Hearing more troubling 
sounds from the engine, doors, and 
other places. Had in for RECALL. 
Only a few months of driving (less than 
5K miles) my GTP seems to be losing 
it's gusto. ""Power on demand"" was right-
on at first but now seems like ""power 
when it wants to not when I want to."" 
Stalled twice coming down driveway with 
a few more close calls. Watch out for 
jerky take offs. Monsoon speakers 
sound 'blown' without ever blaring the 
stereo. Not worth it if it's not crisp 
and clear. What happened to taking a 
little pride in one's work? Shame on

be nice... I love the looks and the 
interior is 1000% improved. I drove a 
94 GP to 201,000 miles and it was

versus previous years though drivers 
seat is mounted way to high for a 
sports car.  Tap Shift works well and 
is fun to operate although not required 
to get the performance..  The 
Supercharger (GTP) is and well worth 
it. Heads Up Display is great and

My last two have run to 125,000 miles and have had to nothing but replace the struts on the '99 model after 100,000 miles.  Prior to replacing the struts, the car rode like an OLD Dodge pickup --- Every bump was felt.  The '04 was purchased with 1,100 miles and rides like an OLD Dodge Pickup.  I feel every bump.  A dealership has aligned, balanced, etc. & still rides like a truck.  Very happy with the '95 & the '99; Severely Disappointed with the '04!!!"

pontiac,grand-prix,2004,TMC, 05/03/2005,Exciting Family Sedan!!!,5,"As a former salesman at a luxury high- end new car dealer, I am definitely impressed with this car!  And, I've driven probably a couple of thousand different cars(cadillac, lexus, infinity, acura, and the normal domestics, etc) Pontiac did an excellent job with the 2004 Grand Prix.  I kept finding myself going ever so faster on the highway.  Virtually no roadnoise at 80 mph+.  I recently did a 300 mile road trip through small towns and highway driving & averaged 28.5 mpg.  Tons of legroom in the front seats.  Easy to read displays.  Some people complain that the interior plastic is too plain, but I was never a fan of imitation wood trim as on some of the ""high end"" cars.  "
pontiac,grand-prix,2004,tjherber2, 11/14/2003,Most bang for the Buck!,4,"I shopped this vehicle and compared 
against the Nissian products and 
prices. It was an easy decision to pick 
the GP when GM is offering great 
incentives.  Rebate, GM card points,  
dealer discount. When all said and done 
I saved 29.6% off MSRP.  The GP isn't 
as refined as the Altima but at less 
then 18K this car offers the most ""bang 
for the buck!""  This is a small price 
to pay to sacrifice refinement which is 
over rated any way."

The few American cars I had never seemed to peak my interest. Until I saw the Grand Prix.

my 97 because it was a good value and 
the 04 GTP comp remains a good value. I 
looked at the G35 and Maxima but when 
negotiating a deal GM remained the most 
competitive with a ton of rebates. The 
car is still fun to drive and practical 
when traveling. Still find the tires to 
be slippery in rain like the 97 but a

I am however a new york resident, and I often get pounded by the snow here. One of the first things that I noticed was that when lifting the windshield wipers up, they are stopped by there arms hitting the hood. This only allows for about 6 inches to clear all the snow and ice off, and they don't stay up, so you have to hold them. Also, the salt requires frequent squirts of washer fluid, but even the slightest cold weather freezes the squirters. The windows freeze easily too. The heated seats will burn your butt though! The chrome handles get scratched very easily. I always wanted a GP, and now I have one, it's nice."

I now have 28,000 miles and have not found one thing wrong and all the panels fit perfectly.  I have the supercharged GTP with the heads-up display. It is really a pleasure to drive and the stability control works like it should."
pontiac,grand-prix,2004,J. Moyer, 06/29/2005,Great Car,4,"I loved the look of the GP when I first saw it, and traded a 2000 Accord V6 for a new 04, black with chrome wheels.  After 58K miles, the GP has been just as reliable as the Accord (which is to say zero problems) and it rides quieter and feels more stable on the highway than the Honda.  However it's fun to drive when I want it to be: acceleration is fine, and new Bridgestone Potenza tires helped the handling (the standard Goodyear Eagle LS tires are cheap squealers in Eagle disguise).  My GP is a car I still look back at after parking it.  The only disappointment is that if I were to trade-in the GP today, I would get much less for it than an Accord that cost me exactly the same."
pontiac,grand-prix,2004,basshed, 06/28/2005,Great adventure companion,4,"I bought the GP after outgrowing an eclipse to take on 4-5hr road trips with the gang.  Efficency was a must, but I also like some sport with the utility and that all came together at a great price point with this car.  I routinely take 5 friends on 3-day weekends with all the gear. It's never short on space or comfort with routine rotation on who sat in back. Mileage exceeds 27mpg always, even fully loaded and it's quick and reassuring when pressed hard. Aside from the known hiccups which were fixed quickly and professionally - bouncy headlights notably and the PCM reflash, it's been 10K miles of carefree fun-for-5 getaway adventures."
pontiac,grand-prix,2004,Bowen, 12/10/2003,Best Pontiac Yet!,4,"I'm sure this review is a bit 
premature since I've only had my GP 
GT1 for about 2 days now but I love 
this car!  It drives great, has plenty 
of power (although I'd still love 
about 20 more horses) and it's very 
comfortable.  This is coming from 
someone that had a 2000 Grand AM, 
which is a great car in its on right. 
There was little difference between my 
GT1 and the GT2 because of the options 
that were put on my car which nearly 
makes it a GT2.  My GT1 has the 
Drivers Package add $755 and the 
Antilock brakes packageadd $600.  
Total vehicle price (before taxes and 
goodies) was $23,750.00
On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd rate the 
2004 Pontiac Grand Prix GT1 an 8."

the Monte Carlo SS, Accord EX V6, and 
the Mazda 6.  This car just overall 
beat the others hands down on 
performance and overall value.  The 
dealership really made the deal with no 
pressure, and only 1 trip back to the 
sales manager.  When I told them my 
bottom line, there was no argument.

has taken big strides forward and a few 
small steps backward.  Starting off with  
fresh and exciting sheetmetal the GTP 
continues its promise with exhilirating 
performance even using regular gas.  This is 
a confidence-inspiring vehicle that is fun to 
drive.  The TAPShift feature is meant for 
spirited driving but here in northeast Ohio I 
find it especially useful for driving in snow.  
Minor irritations include the wierd 
assortment of plastic interior materials and 
the elimination of  the electrochromic rear-
view mirror and dual climate controls for 
driver and passenger."
pontiac,grand-prix,2004,HKK1, 01/11/2004,Best car for the money,5,"One of the best cars I have ever had.

another.  Were we surprised to see that 
the 2004 model was already out. It was 
somewhat of a difficult choice between 
the GTP with or without the Comp G 
package. The deciding factor was 
availble color.  We didn't want to wait 
for the Comp G in a different color.

I am the primary driver and I cannot 
say enough about the handleing of this 
car.  It has the manuverability to get 
me out of any tight spot and is very 
stable at any speed.  I love the 
cornering abilities and love to use and 
abuse the speed limits on curves."

previously had a 2001 GT which was a 
great vehicle. At first I wasn't that 
thrilled with the new design, but when 
I test drove one, I was sold on the 
performance and handling. The new 
series 3 engine has better pickup and 
smoother acceleration than the series 
2. The interior is more of a cockpit 
feel which is great. My vehicle that I 
bought came with chrome rims which do 
make a difference in the overall 
appearance. The cargo space is larger 
and the handling is nice and tight. 
Overall if you are looking for a good 
solid vehicle in the midprice range 
this is one you should look at."

give up a fair amount of luxury also. I 
also believe that a $30,000 car should 
have the basic self-dimming rear view 
mirror, heated side mirrors and climate 
control. A power passenger seat would 
also be appreciated; at least offer 
these as added cost options for those 
willing to  pay. The back seat is also 
not too comfortable and without any cup

Exterior styling and build are

whatsoever getting onto a highway or 
out of somebody ealses way. When I 
first came home with this car, heads 
turned to see this sharp car and other

so much that we purchased another

There are any number of BMWs and Infinitis out there wondering what went by them on the road from LA to Vegas. 
pontiac,grand-prix,2004,Schwoopie11, 02/25/2006,Beware!!,4,"I have had nothing but a headache with this car. Yes, it is fun to drive but that is only when it is not in the shop. I have had this car in 10+ times in the last year for the same thing, a bad BCM. No one can figure out the problem, not even the engineers. I have always been loyal to Pontiac. But never again..This car is not worth buying, beware."

other add-on it intails, I wish I had 
and the car would be perfact, The gas

The most notable improvements are the 
quality of the interior components and 
ergonomics.  The leather is now a much 
better grade.  The trunk has a low lift 
over and with 60/40 split folding rear

With the Fusion Orange paint on this car, it looks awesome. There is power when you need it, and on recent long highway trips, I got just over 30 miles to the gallon. Not bad for a 3.8L."

It is cool,fun car to drive, and it rides great.  I love how the front seats sit, but my husband says they are a litte uncomfortable for him and he calls it my ""chick car"" which I am fine with.  That just means I get to drive when we go places together!"

anything I've ever purchased until I 
got behind the wheel of my GTP.  My 
wife drives it also, so we decided 
against the Comp package because of the 
stiff ride, but that power's still 
there.  It handles great and I can't 
beleive the attention it gets.  The 
cool thing is that most of the thumbs 
up are from the kids driving the little 
Japanese tuner cars.  It's almost as 
enjoyable as the look on their face 
when you blow by them off the line in 
your mid-size sedan.  I love it!"

pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Jon, 08/17/2009,Rocky Start for a 19yo second car.,5,"I bought this car in December from GM with $64,000kms and it did well for the first 1500kms (so I thought). The car was sitting on the dealers lot for months and as a result the calipers seized and wore out my pads and rotors. I ended up having to replace front and rear calipers, rotors and pads in the first 2 months I had the car. Once that was done I haven't had any more trouble with the car. It is a awesome car to drive, Lots of power, Handles excellent, and the it turns many heads.  I LOVE the interior of the car, It's not boring like the impala or century,  The car as of aug has 96,000 kms and I am taking a road trip with friends of around 10,000kms and I have no fear of it failing."

Rounding a sharp corner at night, I found myself approaching a fallen tree across the road. I swerved to avoid the tree and ended up on the embankment hitting another tree at about 45 MPH. Airbags deployed, but nobody was hurt. The car was extremely safe, and was an absolute blast to drive, with amazing handling and performance for a sedan. I am definitely looking into buying another Grand Prix, perhaps this time with a supercharger!"
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,vlee, 10/13/2010,Lots of fun,4,"I purchased my GTP this month from my company.  It has been my company car for four years and I've now put 117,000 on the clock and still a sweet ride without any major issues.  "

It looks blue in some light, green in others and purple under parking lot lights at night!!! It even looks blue and green at the same time, on different planes of the cars surface!! Handles great, no matter the weather, or driving conditions, love the onstar feature, husband used it when he got lost, (WOW) Monsoon sound system to die for, XM clear as a bell "

pontiac,grand-prix,2005,B4crask, 09/16/2004,2005 Grand Prix GTP Comp G,4,"This is an awesome car with excellent 
handling. It looks good both inside and 
out. The supercharged engine has the 
power to get you around anything on the 
road. Good old American Muscle! Glad I 
didn't get the Maxima......
I paid $1500 under MSRP and then got a 
$2000 rebate on top of that. Don't pay 
MSRP. You don't have to. Try getting 
Honda or Toyota to do that for you when 
buying one of thier boring little cars."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Scott, 12/05/2009,favorite car in 26 years of driving,4,"Ok, i have had a lot of cars! 3 brand new ones and 25 used. This is my first Pontiac but I have had many GM's. The first time i drove it i new i was going to buy it. Sounded good, seats and interior are like a cockpit of a jet plane. The only negative is its really hard to accelerate without the front tires breaking loose. This is my favorite vehicle of all time. I would highly recommend this car to anyone that likes a sporty sedan with a great motor, great looks, great comfort, and a great exhaust sound."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Kurls1800, 03/07/2010,Solid,4,"My GP has given me 5 years of great service . I did have a front rotor warpage issue early on and just decided to replace them. Otherwise, just change the oil and other common maintenance. Sad to see Pontiac end its production of Grad Prix's. Love the  Pontiac red dash lights."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,GP fan, 01/08/2006,Impressive American Sedan,5,"I've put 11k Miles on this vehicle and am pleased with its quality.  Its straight line performance is great for a sedan.  Its steering is a bit vague, but that's compared to my compact Mazda.  My 4cyl Mazda only got 2mpg's better with half the horsepower.  The dashboard is a bit bland in all black, so I recently bought a Sherwood dash kit to accent it.  The only other gripe I have is the door handles.  They are to small and slippery for such heavy doors.  If you enjoy modifying your vehicle, there are several sellers of aftermarket parts for this car.  Overall, I really enjoy driving this car.  I get nice comments about it's looks.  I am really glad I bought American."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Blacksheep, 05/27/2006,Get Back into NASCAR,4,This is my second GTP Supercharged. I had a 97. Reliability on both cars (97 & 05) is terrific. Having a fold down front seat has come in handy more then once. I replaced the mufflers with Flow Masters and new exhaust tips. $400 and the car sounds like it wants to go and looks better from the back. My son-in- law replaced the air filter with a K&N filter. My only regret is that I did not know a V-8 was on the way. Pontiac needs to get back into NASCAR. I plan to stay with Pontiac and if it goes the way of Olds I will leave GM. No matter what you do to a Buick it is still the car my 89 yr old father drives and many more like him. No thanks!               
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,njoosse, 11/14/2012,Fairly Good Car overall,3,"Nice big car, lots of room, loads of power from the 3.8 v6. Love the exhaust growl.
I always compare this car to my 04 Honda Accord 4cyl.
This car has way more power and gets the same fuel mileage.
On the other hand it doesn't handle as well and the fit and finish are not nearly as good.
I love
the interior, especially at night.
Reliability is ok. Burns a bit of oil.
 At 100000miles, its starting to squeak and rattle, which my Honda is not.
Overall a pretty good car. "
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Randall Kakara, 11/11/2015,Was a good ride,5,"My wife, average height always complained about blind spots. We bought the car new in 2005 and got 10 good years out of it, but I can never say it was a comfortable ride, esp as WE got older. It became painful on my back to sit in on long trips, and we both had some difficulty climbing out of it as compared to an SUV
"
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,semperfigirl, 12/08/2010,My favorite car.,4,"I got a 2006 Grand Prix as my very first car, it was used.From the moment I started to drive the car I loved it. I never had any problems with it, as I did keep up with care on it. Nothing out of the ordinary happened with it, it was always a great car, specially the night it saved my life, and 3 other peoples. That night the tires slid on ice. We slid straight into a guard rail on the drivers side in the middle between the doors. Then flipped over the guard rail and flipped twice. The car took the impact like a champ, and saved our lives all 4 of us walked away. The car did it's job & protected me and my passengers. This car was nothing but great."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Peter jones, 03/05/2005,Enjoy your GTP,3,"Handling is excellent, the styling is most attractive particularly from the side and front/three quarter views, I love the rush of power in the midrange when you feel the superchargercut in... it really is a fun car to drive. "
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Dr Ratched, 08/19/2010,This car is crap,2,Gee. What DOESN'T work on this car. Paint was peeling off after 2 years and now it has leprosy. Water pump needed replacing after 2 years. It's burning oil like a drunk BP CEO. The cheap plastic on the inside is worn off everywhere you put your hands. The leather seats are fading and tearing. Oh. And the stupid key fob won't work. Avoid this car. Avoid Pontiacs. Avoid GM.
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,CJ73160, 02/01/2005,Front Seats are Torture,3,"The only real complaint I have with this car is the front seat design. It is very uncomfortable to me. I prefer a more flat seat. The side supports in the seat and back begin to bother me after about half an hour of driving. They are helpful when cornering fast, but they are a real pain otherwise. The bottom seat surface is hard and uncomfortable, too."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,SuprChrged '05 GTP, 09/23/2005,Looking for a reason to drive...,4,"I have owned my 05 GTP for almost a month now. The handling is superb, makes going through highway curves at 70 mph a breeze.  Engine is very responsive, supercharged power is there when you need it most.  Performs well for such a heavy vehicle. The interior leaves much to be desired. The inside compared to competitors is dated. The exterior design had to grow on me a bit.  Overall this car is fun to drive, sometimes leaves me looking for a reason to find somewhere else to go.  "
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Marco, 11/17/2005,Wonderful car except,3,"It's been a year since buying the GP sedan.  After the first 10,000 mi with zero problems, it is clear that if GM could build all of their cars this well..."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Doug Haskin, 10/09/2004,Outstanding car w/ great performance,4,"I have had my 2004 GTP CompG for about 
3 months now, and I really enjoy it.  
It has great performance from the 
supercharged 3800 series V-6 engine.  
IMHO this is one of the best engines 
ever built...  GM uses it on almost all 
of its midsized cars, so it has been 
around for years and has many 
aftermarket performance parts 
available.  The interior is all new, 
and it thanksfully is missing the 
plastic interiors of previous 
Pontiacs.  The CompG package is a must 
as well, coming with manumatic TAPshift 
and Head Up Display.  I would recommend 
this car to anyone in the market for a 
sedan with good power and styling."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Sami H, 12/26/2004,"Fast, comfortable and good value",5,"I just bought my 2005 GTP a week ago 
and I couldn't be happier! The car is 
fast, and surprisingly quiet - road 
noise is lower than in BMW330i I was 
test driving.  With the ton of GM year-
end rebates, this car is a bargain!  
NOTE: there seems to be a rebate on 
leather interior - free! I found it 
after checking out the list of rebates 
the dealer had on his computer; that's 
free leather until 3/1/05!  Ask the 
dealer.
I chose to take the GTP without the 
CompG - after test driving both, the 
non-CompG version seemed just as fast 
and nearly as responsive while having 
a very smooth ride.  Monsoon stereo 
sucks - bass is muddy and undefined, 
power lacking; will be replaced.  But 
overall, a great car!"
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,GPMan, 01/02/2005,Great for the Money,5,"I was amazed at the performance of the 
Grand Prix GTP.  The Eaton 5 
Supercharger added a lot of fun to the 
everyday driving I do.  The four speed 
automatic was amazingly smooth and the 
interior is refined.  Even though the 
engine is pushrod actuated, it is 
still more efficient, smoother, and 
more fun than the Toyota V6's.  
Toyota's overhead cam designs detract 
from low-end torque and ""everyday"" 
driving ""gusts"" that are needed to 
pass on the highway.  The interior 
design is also simply and logically 
laid out.  Materials and build quality 
are excellent."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Ben, 07/06/2008,Loving it,4,I have driven Pontiac grand am before but I finally got my Pontiac grand prix after I lost my previous car. Since I got this car I love it more than any car I ever had. It drives so smooth and less external noise. The I felt in love with it the very moment I saw it. I am hoping to keep it for a very long time.
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Aeroheadcww, 07/09/2008,CompG Package makes big difference,4,"My GP is equipped with the CompG performance package which includes: Head Up Display, Tap Shift, higher gear ratios, stiffer rear sway bar, and red brake calipers, maybe a few other things.  The gear ratios dramatically improve acceleration and the sway bar makes this thing handle like a dream. It still maintains a quiet comfortable ride on the highway but is rigid during spirited driving.  My biggest complaint about the car is the shifting performance in standard automatic mode, it just doesn't downshift quickly enough and lets the RPM fall well below the power band before it switches to a lower gear.  This is alleviated by the Tap Shift system which will let you shift manually."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Danfm1, 08/11/2008,Great car,5,"The car is amazing - Pontiac has really improved their products and it can easily challenge foreign cars. The turning is tight, the engine provides plenty of power while sipping gas, there are no rattles and the interior quality is great. It's safe, good looking, and a great ride."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,sullyhaute, 10/02/2008,Not worth what i payed for it,1,"The interior design is cramped. I am only 6 ft. tall and I feel like i am way too big for this car. It will get up and go, but that is about the only thing good I can say, I have already had to replace turn signal bulbs, the paint is peeling off the front bumper and mirror covers. I had to replace exhaust clamps, I have to take it in for re-aligning. I would expect this from a old beater car. but this car still only has about 62,000 mile to date."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Samantha, 10/09/2008,Love my car,4,"My GP is my ""first"" car. I learned to drive in SUVs and trucks, and I usually hate cars b/c they feel so small, but my GP is very roomy, one of the few cars that my dad, who is 6""5', can fit in pretty comfortably. My car handles absolutely great, very sensitive to whatever the driver does. I live in a very hilly and curvy area and the car does the roads great. Although 5 people fit in my car just fine, it isn't really a ""family"" car. "
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Josh, 11/03/2008,Nice looks and powerful engine but...,4,"The looks of this car is what sold me. Beautifal car. I was looking at an 2002 Trans Am, but couldn't find one in good enough shape for the price. Bad things - at 40,000 intermediate steering shaft needed replaced, I guess this is standard as I have seen it many times in other reviews. Leaks from either the windsheild seal or from the antena are common. Water comes through the front dome light, luckily right into the cup holder. Brakes have become horrible, pads are at half wear and squeel noticeably loud, probably due to the drilled rotors. Significant rattle coming from the undercarriage, maybe exhaust? Only happens when in 'Drive', shift to neutral and the noise disappears.  "
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,DAMN SKIPPY, 02/17/2009,First one and I love it,4,"My wife and I traded in her stratus for an 05 Grand Prix GT and couldn't be happier about the decision.  I drive a Mustang 5.0 and I feel like the power from the V6 is quite comparable.  The front seats are super comfy and I feel very ""in control"" with the HUD and the many other features on the console. Although, I wish that the back seats had more head room. It would make it easier to get our infants car seat in and out.  All in all, I am satisfied with this car and hope to trade in for a new one in the future. "
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Christy, 03/22/2009,LOVE IT!!!,4,"I Love my Grand Prix GT, It is the 2nd one I have had. I have heads up display (I hope they always keep that as an option) I think it is great & don't like driving a car without it! I have leather heated seates, Dual Climate Control, Love having the Radio controls on the sterring wheel, Love the auto headlights & power sun roof! Traction Control is great!!!  I hope it lasts a long time... "
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,B at 45, 03/29/2009,A good ride,5,"My GT has been trouble free. Original tires wore quicker than I thought they should, but Goodyears I bought holding up good. I've been very pleased with the gas mileage for this size of car.  17-31 MPG. Alot of remote start in Chicago winter or Phoenix summer and mileage obviously drops.  65 MPH on interstate and 30 MPG.  85-90 MPH on interstate and 25-26 MPG. Over 68500 miles and still on original brakes. I'll need them soon, can feel rotors have a shimmy during hard braking.  Like the oil management system, saves oil, have gone 9000 miles on a couple of changes. This is a great highway vehicle.  Quiet and quick when it's needed.  Good in snow when lived in Chicago. Great AC now in Phoenix."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Aldo, 05/17/2009,Replaced My Boring Toyota Camry,4,"I purchased my Grand Prix because my wife has a 2002 Grand Prix which has 83,000 miles and the only repair was a wheel bearing. I have replaced tires and brakes but these are normal maintenance. I replaced my 2001 Camry, with the 2005 Grand Prix, the Camry was not a good car, I purchased it brand new and it had issues at 25,000 miles which were under warranty, but the last two years it was starting to cost me big bucks, it was time to get rid of it.89,000) Iwas always comparing my Toyota with the 2002 Grand Prix, which I purchased with 16,000 miles. Toyota makes a good car but mine must have been built by trainees. When I saw the 2005 Grand Prix and I took it out, I fell in love with it. "
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Sherry, 06/03/2009,My Car,3,"Car is good over all. Comfortable. Headlights aren't that great. They get scratched too easily. I have problems starting the car. had mechanics check the problem and they can't find anything wrong. engine light won't go off. it's been checked by dealership as well. my car has about 80,000 miles now. it's a little cramped at times. the chevy impala was my first choice b ut had to settle for this car because of pricing. still paid too much. paid 14,000 a year ago. now supposedly worth only about 8,000. no major repairs so far at least. good gas mileeage. would recommend. "
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Paul, 06/15/2009,numerous problems,3,"bought this car new, now has 76K. Have replaced front hub, needing 2nd rear wheel speed sensor, and heads-up display is out. This car has left me stranded on the road 3 times with electrical or fuel problems that they cannot find, always in hot weather, stop and go, driving. Acts like something going thermal. Left me sitting in Nashville for a weekend the first time. Now the front end is falling apart. It will probably be gone soon! This is my 3rd. new GM and by far the highest cost to maintain. Have a '90 Baretta with 240K that has needed less! "
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,JLaws, 07/30/2009,Alot of car for little money,3,"Picked up my gorgeous stealth gray Grand Prix with 84000 miles on it for $5800. After I did the brakes and purge valve, which is a common thing to fail, it drove like a brand new car. Still feels tight after all the miles and very quiet with the windows rolled up. I've owned higher end luxury car, i.e Lexus, Audi, Cadillac STS, so I can see the drop off in the quality of materials, but the GP's base V6 performance feels as powerful as the 300hp+ engines I am used too.I am on a budget and this car satisfies my needs for the time being. I plan to drive it to the ground!   "
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Griffin, 11/01/2009,'05 GT,4,"After trying out several Fords, Dodges, Chryslers, and Chevrolets, my wife and I kept coming back to the Grand Prix.  It has the perfect blend of sportiness that she was looking for, and the roomy practicality that I wanted.  Fully loaded with black leather, moonroof, CD changer, and Monsoon stereo (which is the best factory stereo I've ever heard), you can't ask for much more in a family sedan. Interior ergonomics are unmatched by anything I've ever owned and the heated bucket seats make long drives a pleasure.  No problems to report."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,grand prix no more?, 07/26/2010,Last of a great car,3,"I am on my third gran prix and wish they would keep making them. This is a good car is you drive 20k miles a year. You can drive it for 8 years, get 160k and move on. You can not beat it for the price. Everyone raves about the foreign cars in this class but those cars cost $8k more and those owners put money into the car. I will miss this one when it is done. "
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,FC, 07/31/2010,GP GT,4,"I bought this car for my wife. Certified GM used with warranty. It offers a good drive, with excellent comfort for the leather bucket seats. Driver ergonomics are unmatched. However, with the 200 hp 3800, it feels big and lumbering. I love the rumble from the dual exhaust, but its an overall underwhelming experience. I'd definitely recommend finding a GTP for more power. It has great looks and we love the silver exterior with the black leather and moonroof. Heater fan detonated recently, a costly repair without the bumper to bumper warranty. Other than that, not a single problem!  "
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,thepontiacdude, 02/01/2008,Could have been better,4,"If you care about ""coolness"" more than ""utility"" than it's worth considering this car. However, if you are looking for a family oriented car, I would consider cars like Accord, Camry, Impala, etc. I own a Grand Prix and I think it is a pretty good car and is a lot of fun to drive but unfortunately there are some cons that stand out."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Jeff, 02/11/2005,Need a shoe horn to get in and out,2,Went to buy a Bonneville but Pontiac wasn't dealing with that car so I got talked into a Grand Prix. Nice car and fun to drive but windshield is way to rakish and low. Cannot get in and out without hitting my head. Seat has to at lowest and furthest back position to avoid my head touching the ceiling. Homelink would have been a great option. Back seats are all but useless. Front bucket seats are too narrow. Not a family vehicle.  It was a big mistake to buy this vehicle.  
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Cherise, 02/13/2005,Loyal to the 'Prix,4,"Although I don't love the color (I loved the cherry red that my '99 offered), or the fact that I was forced to buy a 4-door car (2-door no longer offered), overall I still like the car well enough to buy it again.  It's a nice ride, has the options I really like (HUD and heated leather seating), and handles well.  It's sporty, but still reserved.  I love the large trunk and fold down seats (VERY useful for those of us who don't want to buy gas guzzling SUV's).  I like the upgraded lighting package.  The cruise control and HUD display control is awkwardly placed.  The glove box is too small.  The back seat doesn't afford much passenger room, but it works well for kids. A great car all in all!"
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,lisa wooten, 02/15/2005,first new vehicle,5,This is the first new vehicle I have ever owned.  I have 2 grown sons and when my husband and I with the boys go on a trip we ride comfortably.  My boys are not use to that.  The car is the perfect size.  I love the sporty look.  I was amazed when the salesman showed me the car that he said it was a standard package.  Compared to my other cars the Grand Prix was loaded.  I am very happy with my Grand Prix.  Keep up the great work.
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,JstGusha, 02/17/2005,"Awesome Car, Awesome Price!!",5,"Love it, can not tell you enough good things about it.  Drives and handles like a dream.  Floats you over the road, yet nimble and quick."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Art Phippsa, 02/28/2005,Nice Car,5,"The way this car handles,rides and preforms makes it a thrill to drive. The interior is very comfortable and just adds to the fun. This car can compete with any of the imports that I've had over the last 10 years."

pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Marco, 03/18/2005,Competent value,4,"Bought the sedan as an everyday driver. Power with base engine is good.  Overall competent handling, power and braking combination.  Solid feel to build.  No other car offered more value (200 hp, auto, power everything) after rebates."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,B Boulch, 03/25/2005,Best Reliable,4,"I have always owned a Grand Prix. Last year I purchased the 2004 Grand Prix GTP and love it.  The looks, speed, performance and luxeries are great.  My boss bought my 1998 Grand Prix and now he is hooked on the Grand Prixs.  They have always been great cars."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,GT, 03/29/2005,"Looks, Comfort and Fun to drive",5,"Handles like a dream. Very responsive - will ""move"" when needed. Great size - not hard to park but big enough for adults to be comfortable front and back. Sporty but classy. Perfect."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Frank, 03/29/2005,Foxy Sweet,4,"This car is a beautiful car, however some rider may not find it statisfying to them, there are cars are lemons, and dealer has no fault of it. Like any other cars always here and there you will notice a few issues, but on whole this car is reponsive, ecellent riding manner, excellent accerlation, and the look and the power. GM should tight this car alittle bit ad some luxury features inside and that is it, why this car manufatures cheep like that, if they can't improve this car esprcailly becuase it is #1 selling car for them, then I do  ot blame the foreign import to beat the heck on GM."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Tony A., 03/31/2005,My new ride,4,"This is the third Pontiac I've owned and it easily outclasses all the others in all-around performance. Not as fast or cool as the Trans-Am I drove in the 80s, but a lot more useful and quiet for long highway trips. The 3800 V-6 is dead reliable and the ride is firm yet comfortable. The front buckets are a bit tight for persons of girth but the leather/vinyl is very attractive. My wife drives a Grand Am and constantly wants to switch cars with me. I suppose one can call it an average mid-size sedan with solid reliability but that's not intended to be a criticism. It does exactly what I expect it to do: carry me around in style without breaking the bank and making me look like an old fart."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Grandman, 03/31/2005,GTP is the pure excitement!!!!!!!,4,"This is simply the best vehicle that I have owned hands down. I feel like I own the road when I'm dring the GTP. I tried the Maxima and Accord, but they didn't have the excitement or looks of the GTP. The GTP is one brilliantly designed top quality car. I have over 12,000 trouble free enjoyable miles on the GTP."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Kolt, 04/11/2005,My Pontiac,4,"I love this car!  I never would have bought a Pontiac 10 years ago.  The car is designed very well and the seats are very supportive.  The ride is soft yet somehow sporty too.  I love the throaty sound of the exhaust.  I've had three people in the last year comment on how they like the sound of my car.  I often journey on 500 mile road trips and arrive refreshed.  Now the back seat does feel like you are looking out from a well, but I prefer the seat right behind the steering wheel.  The 28mpg rating is accurate.  No hybrids for me when I can have the power and convienence of this engine.  Hats off to GM for the first car I've enjoyed in a long while."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Larry Boulier, 04/20/2005,2005 Pontiac Grand Prix GTP w/Comp-G,4,"My fiancee and I love this car! Fun to drive and plenty of zip off that supercharged 3800 series III V-6 rated at 260+ hp. Styling is eye appealing, the first day we took it out we received several compliments at stoplights and one challenge from some uneducated teen in a Mustang - sorry son- not my fault the 4-door ""family car"" left you in the dust. LOL! The vehicle interior is full of fun gadgets- though the number of buttons can be a little overwhelming at times - each serve their purpose and are nice amenities to have - such as Heads Up Displace, XM Radio, On-Star, Monitors for Oil Life, Average Speed, Trip Time, Gas Mileage and many many more helpful and informative and SAFETY!"
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Greg, 05/14/2005,Great Car - competitive,4,"Originally looked at the LaCrosse but found the interior a bit boring and the responsiveness not as good as the GrandPrix... My wife said the LaCrosse was an ""old lady's car"" and saw the GrandPrix as sportier.  She is right."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Pat, 05/13/2005,Grand Prix GTP,4,Overall the most bang for your buck in a mid-size four door. Can not imagine why it only received a 6.9 by the editor. My only 6 was fuel economy.
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Carrie Ontiveros, 05/27/2005,2004 Pontiac Grand Prix,4,"Having previously owned a 2002 Grand Prix, which was totaled in an accident, I sought another Grand Prix.  I enjoy driving this car due to the quick pick up and go and the comfortableness of the seats.  The interior is much sportier and appealing.  Although I do prefer the 2002 exterior better.  This car looks very sporty and drives very  nicely."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Heather B., 06/02/2005,Grand Prix,3,"My Grand Prix has been taken into the shop a couple of times due to what felt like the transmission slipping, but they said they couldn't find anything wrong.. It still has the same problem after they reset the computer. But they did fix a recall that was on the car. I like the style of the car and it does have power."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Dana, 06/09/2005,GXP is Awesome,4,I have had my GXP for about 3 weeks and it turns heads everywhere I go! I Love this car the ride is smooth and the performance of the V8 is awesome. This is my 3rd new grand prix in 7 years I must say the Grand Prix has been a very dependable car and I have never had any problems with any of them.
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Matthew, 06/11/2005,GXP Awesome and it growls,4,I have`just purchased a Pontiac Grand Prix GXP after trading in an 04 COMP G.  The new car is awesome and it growls like a. tiger.  If you want some power and need an exciting ride this is the car for you 
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Michelle, 06/13/2005,Lots of Miles,4,"I love this car. I love the way it handles, it feels like a luxurious smooth ride especially compared to my fiancee's Grand Am. I love the way it looks, and the interior design.  I have had a few problems though, the transmission needed a complete overhaul after 34K miles.  Now I am having brake and traction system problems at 41K."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,bev, 06/29/2005,Awesome Car,5,"We purchased this car to save on gas, we had a Dodge SUV and it was a loan for gas.  My Grand Prix is fun to drive, classy but yet sporty.  My 7 year old son, thinks he is cool.  I feel like a Princess driving this car. People stop and just look at my car.  It's drop dead gorgeous.  My husband even loves the car."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Naples, FL,Huge Fun to Drive,4,"0-60 in under 6 sec, pretty impressive for a 4 door grocery getter.  The engine makes beautiful music, unmistakable V8 growl from the tailpipes.  Very responsive handling while not completely sacrificing a comfortable ride-the engineers found a good balance.  Pontiac is marketing more stuff to the enthusiast lately, they can be proud of this one. "
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,paintdude, 08/15/2005,Great Car,4,"I bought this car as a used program unit..What a great car. Comfort is bar none, the seats are awesome.

pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Anthony, 08/16/2005,Good Car,5,"Since we bought the car it has never been back for any type of warranty work or any other repairs. Workmanship is excellent. We just change the oil, refuel the car and drive it. Handling is good and it drives well. We like the style, both interior and exterior, very functional. Good car.    "

If you enjoy power, buy the car!"

pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Robyn, 10/11/2005,Fun Car!!!!,4,"This was my first Pontiac purchase after owning Ford vehicles for several years.  Overall, I love the car.  It's sporty looks and fun handling makes it a real treat to own.  The only complaint that I have about this car is in the extremely low front-end which has a tendency to smack or scrape the ground on almost any little bump.  In addition, I've experienced suspension problems (CV Joint and Struts) in the one year timespan i've owned this vehicle.  Aside from that, I must say that I do love the car.  I'm a new Pontiac fan!!!"
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Rick E., 10/29/2005,Great car not reflective of editors rate,4,"We have only had the car a few weeks but love the handling, and bought the car because of the great 3.8 engine. Ride is smooth, and engine is not noisy as reflected in editor's critique. Back seat is tight, and no molding strips to protect door bangers. But comfortable, fun driving car that looks great."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Thebigb, 10/31/2005,It sounds great,4,"Traded a 2003 Yukon for 2006 Grand Prix GXP. Had read review in various magazines and lived up to all of the hype. Fantastic power, great features, and best of all the $34000. list was reduced to $27,500 out the door. Car is equipped with every available option including Nav and power sun roof. GM dealers are willing to deal big time right now, and you can get those ""employee discounts"" without the program. This car was on the dealers lot for over 30 days, so he wanted to move it. Got it in black with black interior. Just looks real cool. "
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Phil, 11/07/2005,2nd Grand Prix First GTP,4,"This vehicle has all the power and sporty style a driver requires.  The front seats are very comfortable.  The controls are very easy to use but plain.  The rear seat certainly could have more leg room considering how deep the trunk is in this vehicle.  The truck is almost too large.  The superchager certainly moves this vehicle and without premium gas. I have owned a 2002 Grand Prix GT and have NO repairs or warranty work.  The sporty style is what I wanted and still remains true in the 2005.  The interior is plain and cheatly made, the overhead garage door compartment has been broken and is currently held together with tape.  I do not plan on paying $50+ to replace it.  Inc. Interior Qual"
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Mike, 11/20/2005,Comp G is great fun,4,"Just recently purchased an 05 GTP Comp G with every imaginable extra available, which on this car is a lot. I like the power of this car, although it could use an auto 5 speed so it get's up and goes a bit better at higher speeds. Very comfortable up front; in back I don't know or care. My only complaint is I already have several creaks and rattles on the interior pieces which are cheap plastic. "
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Kevin, 12/23/2005,Cool Car,4,"All and all, this is an awesome car. Many are complaining about the fuel economy or the bumpy ride, but guess what, this is a sports car, not a geo! I gave this car a low rating on fuel economy, but I knew that going in. That is not why I bought the car. The fuel economy is not that important to me, but the size of the tank is. Even with the DOD, this car goes through alot of fuel, so why the puny 16 gal tank? Other than that, I love this car, very fun to drive, very comfortable (unless you are over 6 ft, I'm 5'10'' so I'm good), and tons of cargo area. I put six golf bags in the trunk without folding the seats."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,APR, 12/31/2005,V8 Bang for the Buck Winner,4,"Dreamed about this car a year before it was available.  Great looking machine w/ the performance (HP, torque, braking, suspension) to support it.  Surprisely controlled torque-steer (traction control) and instantaneous response from the beefed- up 4T65E tranny.  The LS4's torque band is huge and pulls from one end of the tach to the other.  The StabiliTrak Sport is simply amazing in the snow/ice allowing you to drive safely while having some fun to boot.  The PBR brakes (huge drilled & vented rotors w/ dual pistons calipers up front) are gorgeous, responsive, and fade-free.  After 6600 mi. we're averaging 20.2 mpg (trip computer) w/ mostly highway (using cruise control) driving @ 74mph."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,dpdevil16, 02/01/2006,Uncompromising Sport and Utility to Boot,4,"The car's looks and amazing versatility make this a vehicle that should stand out, especially for a sports sedan.  What other vehicle in its class can boast being able to store a 10-foot 2x4, PVC tubing, or a Kayak inside the vehicle with all doors closed?  The suspension meets a fine balance between sportiness and confort, while the acceleration is enough to arouse a the Indy racer in all of us.  The Grand Prix is certainly a far cry from the midsized coups of yore and is a great utility vehicle and road cruiser.  I am happier with my purchase every day that I drive it.  I've yet to find a dislike."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,adamb, 04/23/2006,Pretty Nice Car,4,"This is overall a great car.  I get tons of looks while driving this car up and down the streets of my city.  I think that these seats are really comfortable, almost on the level of my ma's lexus.  This car corners like a dream.  Taking 25mph corners at 60 is fun and a breeze.  (yeah im only 20 so this is something i do on occasion:)) The engine is great.  Beat a newer mustang off the line last week, im sure he was happy about that.   I think that the build quality could be better. lots of rattles.  Also, have had it in the shop all last week for a problem with it not running right sometimes in the morning.  Im not sure what this is, but they said the computer was out of date in it. "

next. Pontiac has suggested that they 
may have to crate up the engine and

body style of the Grand Prix is great.

pontiac,grand-prix,2005,DMV, 11/27/2004,Pontiac Grand Prix GT: Take another look,5,"Looking forward to the release of 
Buick's replacement for the Regal, I 
kept looking at the Grand Prix. After 
driving both the LaCrosse CXL and the 
Grand Prix GT, the choice was easy. The 
GP-GT is more to my personal liking due 
to its crisp handling (for a midsize 
vehicle, it is great), and the 
responsiveness in acceleration, even 
though the LaCrosse & GP are built on 
the same platform and use the same 
powertrain. The GP is simply more 
sporty than its cousin from Buick. On a 
rercent trip, I experienced 31 MPG at 
highway speeds. The comfortable leather 
interior that kept away fatigue on a 5-
hour drive: very nice! The Monsoon 
system would be worth the extra money"

pure excitement that gives confidence 
to any driver and a little attitude.  
With the quick acceleration and easy 
handling you can glide over any road 
imaginable and avoid those potholes on 
your daily route to work.  I am a very 
satisfied customer and if you see me 
coming just get out of my way.  That 
Pontiac is a mean machine!"
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,KEVIN PARKER, 01/16/2005,GRAND PRIX GIVES YOU EXCITEMENT!,5,"The 3.8L V-6's 205 Horsepower gives true excitement to this sporty mid-size sedan. The low end torque moves the Grand Prix across intersections with tremendous authority, leaving most cars behind! Most passengers ask if I have the supercharged V-6 that comes in the pricier GTP. Fuel economy averages 28 miles per gallon with highway trips averaging well over 30 miles per gallon! The front bucket seats are very supportive and hold your body in place when taking avantage of the twisty road ahead of you. The back seat offers above average passenger comfort and handles the child safety seat just fine. Pontiac has lived up to its reputation of excitement with this new Grand Prix as well as value!"
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,clarkb2999, 01/23/2005,A Great Steal,4,"After rebates, paid just under $14K.  For that amount, it is a great car.  It is responsive and engergetic in everyday driving, quick when pushed.  Individual Map lights are absent on the Base model, which most base Korean cars have.  Base stereo is weak.  Still a bit too much hard plastic on the dashboard, though the layout/ergonomics are FAR improved from the previous generation.  A generally great car, and even without the insane deal, I would happily drive it over the boring 4 cylinder versions of the Camry, Accord, Altima, or Mazda 6.  "
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Jboag5, 01/23/2005,Luv my GTP,4,"This car has been fun to drive, yet is good for the family. Its the perfect car for those of us who don't want to grow up yet. It has had some minor issues, but overall its performance, I feel, beat the Saab, Volvo, and BMW that I drove at the same time. This car is comfortable, fast on the take off and is 'solid'. I could have purchased the other vehicles, but the GTP was roomier, more comfortable, and more fun!"
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Sue the car, 01/24/2005,Sallys Ride,4,So far we like everything about the car. The super charger is great for getting out on the highway.
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,K Curry, 01/27/2005,Gotta love it,5,Car is everything I would want in a vehicle.  As far as engine being too loud I guess people just don't like muscle cars anymore in this country.
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,JBS, 02/06/2005,05 Grand Prix GT,4,"I just took delivery of my new 05 GT and have had it now for about a week.  I am very impressed with this vehicle.  It is my 2nd Grand Prix and the car has gotten much better.  The restyled interior is great.  Everything is within easy reach of the driver's seat.  The throttle response from the engine is right where it needs to be, and the engine has plenty of power in passing situations.  The handling seems much imporved as well.  The only negative so far is fuel economy in city driving.  On the Highway its great but in day to day situations it can be improved."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Lucy, 02/08/2005,Fun Car,4,The car is both sporty and practical. It has lots of pep. I drove it in a snow storm and felt very safe. Front seats are comfy. Rear seats not so comfy for adults. 
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,d klink, 02/19/2005,Just fun to drive,4,"I have the Comp G model and just love it.  It's fun to drive, comfortable to ride in for long lenghts of time and has power when needed.  This is my second GTP and the 05 is greatly improved over my previous 02 model.  Five travel in comfort will plenty of truck space for luggage."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,edyhskl, 03/08/2005,My 3rd Pontiac,5,"Had 00 Bonneville se,02ssei & now Grand prix GT. The Bonnie was getting pricey so I got a GP with leather, heated seats, sun roof & optional aluminum wheels. Love the car, sporty handling in turns and still comfy on the hwy and am getting far better mpg than ssei. Got about $5000 off list with GM incentives. Was looking at Camrys and they were stripped down at this price. I'm also a big fan of the 3.8v6... even with the pushrods."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,aboatz, 03/13/2005,Fueling Excitement,5,"Cars are often rated by factors such as reliability, safety, and performance, but there is one key feature that most reviewers can't explain...the thrill.  The Grand Prix, particularly in the GTP w/ Competition Group package, was a car that was immediately exciting to sit in, and even moreso once it was taken on the road.  All stresses and worries are taken away every day when I get in it now...it has the stability and roominess of a large car, but effortless steering and power more typically associated with lighter sports cars.  Not only that, but the car allows me to go fast, look fast, and not look like a pompous jerk or a pimpled teen while doing it.  Accords don't have that ability."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Tony Almaguer, 03/15/2005,Love those Pontiacs!,4,"The car offers more performance, comfort and luxury features than anything else in its size range. GM's financing made it our lease a ""steal"" and we'll be back for another one in 3 years. BTW, our other car is a 2003 Grand Am GT 2-dr that offers sportiness at a low price. It ain't a performance car, but it sure gives good value for the money!"
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Arlin, 03/18/2005,Great buy and fun to drive,4,"Bought a 2004 GTP for myself and this year a 2005 GTP for my wife. Both are great cars, however the 2005 has the heads up display which is nice and the XM radio which is a dream. Speed and handling are superb even in snow. Traction control saved me on black ice! Only down side it is a little tight with people in the back seat as I like a lot of leg room when driving. Styling is subjective but it appears mean looking particularly in black."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Bob Lutz, 03/19/2005,awesomeness,5,So much low end power.  Love it
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,SFeldman Nutley NJ, 03/22/2005,Time for a change...,4,"My '99 Buick Regal LSE was getting up in mileage and I was attracted by the GM rebate offers.  '04 was the last year for the Regal, so I checked out the LaCrosse.  I was not thrilled by the syling and looked at the Pontiac G6.  While looking at the G6 is saw the Grand Prix.  I loved the exterior styling and noticed that many options on the LaCrosse were standard on the Grand Prix."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,William Weirich, 03/24/2005,Bills review,4,"This is one one the better cars I have purchased in the last 10 years. Drives great, great takeoff, handling is perfect, and the comfort of the interior is excellent."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,pro driver, 03/24/2005,Excellent Value,4,"All I can say is drive this thing and enjoy. I came out of a park avenue and into the grand prix. It rides a little rough compared to the park ave, but this thing is slick. The handling and the comfort form a mid sized Rocket ship is outstanding. The fule mileage is outstanding and the sight lines are also great from a car so low to the ground. Go and have some fun and be safe. "
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,racing 8, 03/23/2005,Great car,4,"This is my first new car and we love it, the appearance is great, the ride is the best that I have ever been in, has a great sound system, it's quite inside the car and has a lot of room in the back seat "
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Paul, 04/05/2005,GTP Performance,4,"From the day I bought the Grand Prix GTP I really enjoyed the performance of the supercharged engine. The only problem is the low roof line.  I enjoy driving long distances the seats and gauges are excellent.  Gas mileage is okay for a large midsize car.  Even though the 3.8 is old technology, GM has come a long way with making the engine quite yet with the supercharger it is very responsive."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,5th gp,still fun,"5th grand prix,but still fun to drive.",5,"Very comfortable, solid build quality and gives performance and handling with many choices from sedan to gxp. Two trips and averaged 32 mpg on the freeway, some small cars can't achieve. I have tweaked my car a little and the 3.8L V6 is probably the best gm V6 that they made, rock solid and reliability to back it up. Excellent looks and big enough for the family and huge trunk for the summer vacation. My grand prix is fun to drive and is that what its all about, enjoying driving your car and for the price its a darn good deal."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,michelle, 04/21/2005,gtp,3,"I fell it is to small, I paid 32,000 and went back 6 months later to trade in and they only wanted to give me 16000.  Feel every bump, speakers vibrate too much"
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,mary lou barnwell, 04/23/2005,pontiac gran prix.. it turns heads.,4,i love the responsiveness of this beauty. it will get you out of bad situations...and safely home. its a thrill to step on the gas and feel the response. people head turn to look at the fusion orange metallic.people come up to admire the color.we totally love this car.it has been pure pleasure for us.i love the heated leather seats.the monsoon stereo.the pure quickness of it.
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,hibay, 04/23/2005,My GP,5,"Great value and fun to drive everyday. Good in the snow and wet. Ride needs some fine tuning, especially driving around Detroit roads"
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,illuminate1, 05/10/2005,All Around Performer,4,"This car excels at most of the things that most drivers expect out of a $30k car. The cleverness, utility and  layout of the interior lead to an overall pleasant driving experience...And don't get me started on the 3.8 supercharged V6...truly a guilty pleasure. That, in conjunction with the TAP-SHIFT paddles on the steering wheel can have a tendecy to give one an ""Andretti"" complex. It can also serve less sporting tastes with a serene, yet communicative driving experience when called upon. Although some may find the Comp-G suspension a little harsh, the ride is well controlled and confidence inspiring, and the car as a whole is rock solid stable at high speeds...or so I've heard, heh,heh."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Sheila, 05/21/2005,Grand Prix GTP,4,"Car is fun to drive; many of the options I didn't really think I needed, but now love them.  Particularly the supercharged engine.  However, am disappointed in the size (too small) and ride - not the soft, cushy ride I am used to in other GM products.  Overall, am happy with car."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,MAPhil, 05/22/2005,GTP,4,"Great lines with quick response.  I have taken down a few of the competitors...sorry Monet Carlo, I'm glad I didn't buy one!  Too bad it is front wheel drive w/ no manual...oh well the rest is good to go."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,SDouglas, 05/25/2005,05 Grand Prix,5,"I have been pleasantly surprised by the quality and comfort of my Grand Prix; haven't had to take it back to the dealership for anything except routine maintenance which is pleasant surprise after dealing with numerous recalls & problems with my last 4 (new) vehicles. Also, I drive a lot of miles & still enjoy driving the Grand Prix after a year. LOVE the color - Fusion Orange Metallic, enough gray already!!"
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Keith McDonald, 06/17/2005,grrrreat vehicle,4,"Just bought the new GXP, my first Pontiac.  Have had Chevy, Geo, Nissan's, Toyota, and Mazda before.  This by far is the slickest, most powerful, fun to drive, and packed with the most features for the money.  This one came fully loaded with everything except navigation system.  The driver and passenger seats are very soft and comfortable and can be positioned in numerous ways.  Dual climate climate control is nice.  Radio automatically adjust for sound as you speed up or slow down.  The V-8 will cut off 4 cylinders once you get to cruising speed to save gas mileage.  This puppy gets about 27 MPG on the highway which is nice for a V-8 with 303 hp."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,mikej, 06/18/2005,A driver's car,5,"This car is outstanding with 18"" wheels the ride and handling rivals anything on the road. Fit and finish are excellent, this is a driver's car. Dual exhaust also gives this car the sound of my 70' corvette.  "
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,jerry young, 06/20/2005,Fun to Drive,5,"I just purchased the Grand Prix GXP,  this car is fast.  We were looking at buying the GTO for sports car look and performance.  Since my wife and I travel alot, along with my 2 boys, and after looking in the trunk of the GTO, which you can only fit 2 small bags.  We decided to get the Grand Prix, it has good looks, 4 doors, but when me and my wife drove this car, whow, the V8 has a lot of power for a family car.  It handles like a race car. It's fast, sleek, and good looking.  Just in the 3 days that we have had the car, a lot of kids and adults have complimented on this car.     "
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,tonyGXP, 07/17/2005,GXP Black,4,"My gxp is loaded without navi, what can i say?? Go and drive one!!! Its nicer than anything in its class, foreign & domestic. Fast, handles like its on rails, stops better than any car i've ever driven, i get compliments on this car without people even looking on the inside ( exhaust especially)how & why would you buy an accord or camry or an impala ss (even with a v8) i paid 27k for mine sticker was $33,396, beat it, you won't be able to.   "
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Thunder, 07/19/2005,Eye-Catcher,4,"Blue-Green Crystal gets lots of compliments in parking lots, gas stations, etc.  Great performance, but if the idea for bigger tires in the front really was to reduece torque steer, I don't notice much improvement over my former '98 GTP.  Still, be aware of it and it's not a problem. Very solid ride with little or no body lean into corners.  City mileage hasn't worked out as advertised yet, though I only have 600 miles on it, so far.  Hopefully it'll get better than the current 14 mpg after a couple of thousand miles.  Highway miles are decent (26mpg) and should also improve, soon. HUD is much better and more informative than older models.  Exhaust?  Aaaah, sounds like my old Z- 28. "
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,jammerman, 07/20/2005,Mid Life Dream Car,4,"Saw the Grand Prix GT at Auto Show, loved the sportiness, but didn't buy - boy am I glad!  When GM offered the employee pricing, discovered Pontiac had released a more sporty, upscale GXP - basically a GT with the V8 and all the sporty options (mags, chrome highlights, etc.)  with the slightly lowered profile, this car screams speed!  Everyone on my friends are green with envy.  Nice throatty growl, instrument cluster well placed.  TAP shifter makes it a fun cruiser."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,L C, 07/27/2005,Absolute Beauty,5,This car thrives on the lead foot driver that can resist temptation. This car can also double as a contemporary family sedan. 
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Mark Moody, 07/31/2005,Not your typical boring 4 door,4,I just purchased an 05 Grand Prix GT great car at a great price with the employee discount saved almost $7000.00.This is my second Grand Prix GT we also have an 02 which after 75000 miles has yet to give us any problems.I test drove many other cars but came back to Pontiac.For the money I couldn`t find a better equipped car.The Grand Prix GT for us is a nice combination of good looks power and reliability.   
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,AK Milwaukee, 08/04/2005,It's a gas hog but fun to drive,4,"I'm not getting anywhere close to the posted EPA estimates but the sound, power, and handling far outweigh the 21 mpg I average, (and that's driving it sanely!) with 60% hwy and 40% city driving.  It pulls a little when doing heavy braking but torque steer on acceleration is minimal.  Roomy and comfortable on the inside but I don't understand why Pontiac can't give this car memory settings for the seats - my husband is 6' 4"" and I'm 5' 5"" - tough to exchange drivers.  Also, some gas pedal extension would be nice.  For the price I think this car is a great value.  I switched from a 2002 Chrysler 300 M and am glad I did."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,docV8, 08/08/2005,great value,5,"I had to go a ways to find this car, but it was worth it.  I was looking at this or a BMW 545, and this took the cake (yes, really). Interior feels wonderful, exterior is beautiful.  Power is everywhere.  Despite what journalists are saying, torque steer has not occured yet, but for one time when it was floored at 10 MPH on uneven pavement.  All I had to do was hang on tighter.  Rear drive cars will break traction and get all twisted up (slip/regrip/lurch)if you floor it on uneven pavement, so what's the big deal?  I guess some self proclaimed 'enthusiasts' like to kick out the rear end around corners, but if you ask me, I'd rather stay pointed where I want to go. Back seats are great too."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,AdamBrantner, 08/20/2005,Highly Recommend!!!,5,"Love this car... Handles great.  Power is good even from the base engine.  Inside is VERY comfortable.  I have not tried out the backseat yet,,,,,, but the front seats are very comfortable.  I am over 6 foot tall so it's hard to find a car with good seats.  But this car has it.  Love the way they wrap around you.  Also love the styling.  I get several looks from people as I drive through the burbs with this car."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,DIANA WRIGHT, 08/22/2005,Sporty and comfortable,4,This car has a lot of power and maneuvers very well with the front wheel drive. It has a sporty appearance but yet roomy on the inside. The front seat is extremely comfortable and there is lots of room in the back seat for 3 more passengers. I also like the easy access to the trunk from the back seat. This is a nice feature for long road trips. We really enjoy our GRAND PRIX we had a GRAND AM for years and were excited to see the GRAND PRIX. 
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Robo19, 09/07/2005,A Great Car,4,This car is everything you need in a sports car but the best part is that it's a sedan. I love driving this car it handles so well and it has a very racecar kinda feel to it. The dual exhaust sound GREAT!! So all in all this is a great car!!!!
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Mr MRG, 09/08/2005,GXP is Great,4,"No better combination of performance, ride, comfort, handling, safety and practicality. I can have my fun and haul the family away in comfort on the weekends.  Solid build and even with the 300HP never seems out of control."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,TinMan, 09/08/2005,Good Car- Very good Price,4,"Overall, I have been pleased with the GTP. I have owned the supercharged engine before and it's a primary reason why I bought this car. It is very strong at 260 hp- although I have not gunned it too much yet- still new. The car definitely looks cool in black-  almost batman -like. I get all kinds of looks from people. Lots of features plus a good, sporty look got me into this car. I also got the GM employee price minus my GM card rebate which came out to be around 25K for a totally loaded 2005 GTP. Pretty good deal for what you get. Definitely not a boring-looking Accord or a Camry.."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Duke, 09/30/2005,I Love this car.,5,I had a 2005 Mustang GT and that was the 6th Mustang I owned. After only 3 months I sold it and bought the 2005 Grand Prix GXP. Soooo many more features and it handles incredibly great for a sedan. And regardless of what the magazines say. The Grand prix beat the Mustang at the Drag strip in (STOCK) form by a tenth of a second. Not bad for a sedan. The suspension and brake system is great and the tires are the same as the factory Mercedes AMG 500. For some reason this car was never advertised and the magazines won't print much about it. To all the magazine editors out there. WAKE UP. All you need Is a few aftermarket companies to make some goodies and this car will blow the doors off anythn
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,MJ2, 10/14/2005,Love this car,4,"I have had Pontiacs since I got my license (ok, forget the 69 Dodge Dart), but have also been loong at BMW's and Acuras.  This is by far the best bang for the buck.  Every time that I have gone in for service (nothing wrong) or a car wash, the car receives compliments galore.  Get over the import hype, and you see a vehicle that is (hopefully) the new beginning of the American auto industry.  Worth every penny."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,kyler kelley, 12/18/2005,fast and looks good in my garage,4,car is awesome.  very fast. mustang guys think you got some v6 car when you pull up until they see the v8 badge on the back as you pass them.  i also have not driven it in 6 weeks due to crappy weather it looks great in my garage
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Ben, 01/31/2006,love it,5,My Grand Prix is the best car I have ever owned. I enjoy the comfortable ride along with the great gas milage. The power is always there if I need it.
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Mark, 02/16/2006,Great ride,4,Car Is the greatest in this class. Preformance is mind blowing. I have never driven a car in this class with this much power. Extras are just right. handles like a true sports car.
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,commander, 04/13/2006,GXP,4,I hav owned this car almost a year and have loved it since day one. This is not one of those cars that you will regret owning several months later. 
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Comp G, 04/28/2006,Comp G,5,Excellent choice. Only problem I had was with shaky headlights. Problem fixed with TSB. Very well powered for an average 24.5 MPG. Head room space is tight as well.
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Brian, 06/11/2006,Dark Cherry GXP,4,"Lots of power with torque-steer, I always say hold on when you put the pedal down. Over-all it's a fun to drive but it does drink fuel even it you drive it normal. Road ruts created by the large trucks seem to whip the car from side to side. My 03 chev had no problem with the ruts, this car does. I'm totally shocked that I need to repair my front brakes at only 25,000 miles considering 90% of the miles are HWY driving and that I really am gentle on my brakes.GM not willing to do anything about the brakes even so it's still under warranty."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Gredblg, 09/15/2006,I L-O-V-E my Ponti-Rocket!,4,"I did a HUGE amount of research (read every Edmunds' review) before buying an American car. Having Japanese cars for 20 years -- I wanted to be sure that the 25K/year I put on a car as a salesman would be done reliably. I've had my Grand Prix GTP for 7 months now and it's the fastest, most powerful, most comfortable, best looking and one of the most well-built cars I've ever owned. No car from Japan can compare with what it feels like to slide behind the wheel of my beautiful, much beloved Pontiac to go out into the world everyday. Meet me at the next green light and I'll show you why it's called a 'Grand Prix'. Great job, Pontiac..I'm truly, deeply in love! (never had that with a Nissan)  "
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Toni Ahlgren, 10/24/2006,Blue/Green Chrystal GXP,4,"My 2005 GXP is an outstanding performance sportscar. I love the output from the engine when I step on it. It feels like the rear-axle is somehow kind off ""glued"" when I stop and go and at a redlight if I make a normal start. Feels little bit ""jerky"""
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Aces, 12/26/2006,Great car interior lacks somewhat,3,"Apparently Pontiac Motors thinks a lot of plastic is ok in the interior of a retail $30,000 car. I disagree. The car preforms fantastic, great power and exceptional handling. The car will understeer if pushed too hard. The brakes are ok if you don't consistently pound on them, they are not track ready. The size of the car is to be taken into consideration as it is a wide body and can be difficult to park. I love the car."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,corvette, 01/17/2007,Great Value,4,I love this car. I can not think of a better value. I also own a corvette and like to use my grand prix for long trips. I will get good use of it for 4- 5 years and it will still have a decent life for the next owner. Comparing it to a car like the vette is not fair but dollar for dollar it is work every cent. You get a powerful engine that responds. Decent comfort and great style. Try other cars that are priced the same and the grand prix is at the top of the list.
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Bad Dave, 02/07/2007,Happy with my Comp-G,4,"I have now had my 05 Grand Prix GTP Comp G for 2 years and 32,000 miles. I can't complain. Build quality and reliability are excellent. The s/c 3800 is fantastic! Instant power when you need it, mash the gas and hold on. Average 24 to 25 mpg overall on mid- grade fuel. This car handles the twisties with ease and glides over the highway. Handles the Vermont winters with no problem due to a set of Blizzacks and Stabilitrak. Huge trunk, excellent heated leather seats, and sound system. Lacks a bit on headroom though and rear legroom can be tight. Installed K&N filter. Overall, a good little daily driver and nice upgrade from my previous Grand Am's. Can't wait to trade up to a V8 GXP!"
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,adamb, 03/12/2007,2nd review; Almost at the two year mark.,3,"If you look back about 5 - 10 reviews, you'll see another one from me.  This is just an update of that review.  At this time, my 2005 grand prix turned over 50k last night.  The dealership still has not figured out why it doesn't run right at times.  They seem to think i'm crazy.  Really, i'm not.  It feels as if the brakes are sticking almost, but they say they aren't.  I don't know what to do anymore, so this car is for sale as we speak.  I'm getting an 07 Camry very soon.  No more GM for me.  Sorry.  All in all, I would really have liked this car had it not been for this weird problem, and the problems with build quality.  Rattles are getting worse.  I do live in a large city with rough roads."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,CEN19, 03/24/2007,"Better than good, but not quite perfect",4,"JD Power rated this vehicle as a good buy for reliability and I have to agree.  I've had only two minor issues that were quickly corrected under warranty. Very comfortable around town and on the highway. Acceleration with the supercharged engine is excellent, as is braking. This is a large vehicle, so handling is good but not great. Fuel economy is in the low 20s with mostly highway driving; nothing close to the 28 mpg listed on the window sticker. Interior materials are a mix of good to cheap, with some areas nicely padded and textured; others are cheap in feel and durability. Red illumination of instrumentation is very appealing. All controls are easy to operate and very intuitive.  "
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Whammy, 05/13/2007,Love it,4,"Love the ride and performance. Need more storage in the front and a little hard to see my blind spot when changing lanes, other than that its great. Very sporty, great handling and excellent pick up when I need it. The red illumination is great also."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Superbia, 08/06/2007,The Perfect Machine,5," Pontiacs in past years for some people has driven up a rep for being pieces of junk. The new line is far from being junk! My favorite is the the GP GT!   It has a good look but is not considered to be a high-end pompous car like some  others. The brakes are good, the acceleraation is great, the highway handling is good, and the comfort is pretty good as well. The back seats do have some tiny issues but all in all they are great for the kind of car this is. Corners well and the 3.8l v6 has got some power ready to rumble!   If someone dares race you, thinkig this car is among the ordinary, they will soon find out it is not.       "
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Samurai, 07/05/2007,More than Meets the Eye!,4,"The biggest bang for your buck! A refined machine that is easily underestimated. The exterior is sweet and the interior great. The interior design is made for the driver (that is the purpose of driving, right). I hate how the imports overly centralize the dials and in some cases the gauges right in the middle of the car. The interior is simple and not over done like the imports. Their designs tend to be a lot busier. The power is just right, handling great."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Dr. Rob Rice, 03/11/2008,I feel like a Giant in this thing,4,"All-in-all, I love this car. Handles well, all the gadgets you can ask for and it's beautiful. However, I'm not a giant (just 6'1"") yet I either have to slouch or lean my head. XM radio should be moved to front or all the way in the back - it's covered with sunroof down which makes for poor XM reception especially when traveling S. Both interior and exterior are stylish.  People are definately jealous when they get in. Heated seats are awesome. I hate winter."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,ballbreaker910, 05/30/2013,Very Good Quality Car,4,"I purchased this car to replace a car that was on its last leg. After reading reviews from a website like this I decided to purchase one. It was a well made decision. This car is very reliable. I lived 2 miles from work and found out the hard way how bad the car was on gas, especially with local driving. However on the highway I was able to get about 25 mpg. Things I noticed before trading it in was it began to burn oil. The indicator advised me of low oil well before the 3000 mile recommended oil change and I used synthetic blend. Overall. It was a great car."
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Russ, 04/09/2008,"Wow, what kind of car is this?",4,"I get that question asked all the time.  I don't know how to answer because it's so different from the base Grand Prix that I often just say ""GXP"" and then the person who asked shuts up and you can tell they have no clue what a GXP is.  "
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Ray G, 08/04/2016,"Great Car, some slight issues rear view.",5,"We purchased this car used with Warranty from GM still in tact. It's been a great car, cosmetically it is beautiful. The short stubby antenna is horrible for receiving radio stations unless you are in town near the transmitter site or within a 10 mile radius. Steel antennas do a better job. Other than the reception of FM/AM in this car, the only other gripe I have, it much like the Trans Am, and Grand Am, the Grand Prix feels like you are having to lift yourself out of the car. I am used to a mini van or SUV where I don't need to LIFT myself from the seat. The seats are very comfortable. Maintenance on this one is great. No mechanical problems the entire time I have owned it which is about 4 years now. (Knock on wood). There is lots of trunk space, I do notice blind spots in the back while driving. Sometimes we may not notice a vehicle riding in our blind spot. The back seat seems to block our view also the angle of the posts for the roof support are positioned in a way which create a blind spot. The 97 Grand Am also has the same problem. They are good cars, but the blind spots and sitting low to the ground are an issue I cannot over look. Other than those issues, I am happy with the quality of the 2005 Grand Prix. It is very reliable, and does exactly what a car needs to. if a bulb burns out, the computer will tell you. Then you replace it. No more warning signals. I do like the intelligence, of this car. But miss the cars where computers didn't run everything.

pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Tom, 04/16/2008,Worst vehicle I've ever owned,3,"Great power and fun to drive, however, 2 pages of repairs including 3 transmissions, tie rod ends, 3 $340 tires, this car was towed 6 times, when I basically gave it away on a trade-in it was diagnosed with another bad transmission and a bad starter!! Drove it a total of 86K. Of all the new vehicles I owned in 35 years this one is the worst. At one point the dealer said he was going to get GM to take the vehicle back, but, that TOO didn't happen. My wife actually told me ""that car or me"". I love my wife. "
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Stuck, 05/09/2008,If I knew then what I know now,3,"This is the most expensive car I have purchased and it has been in the shop for 4 major issues 6 times in just over 2 years.  At 2 weeks check engine light-replaces senor.  Then sun roof leaked twice and flooded car, burning oil-replace exhaust gaskets, steering wheel noise - had to lube steering shaft, now lights in dash burned out and constant vibration in steering wheel.  Just afraid what is next? Stuck payment wise or would dump this lemon."

pontiac,grand-prix,2005,LouF, 08/14/2019,This car has been excellent,5,"I don't know how so many people complain about this car when I haven't had virtually any if the problems I read about. In fact, as I do work on it, I am quite impressed with the design and manufacturing of it. The list is too long, but it's moot now since the division was dissolved.  This is highly underrated in my book.

Update 2020: Yep, still driving it, and same review - great $/year.

pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Mak, 01/22/2020,Not a bad car for the price,4,"I bought my Pontiac Grand Prix safetied almost a year ago at 246xxx kms. I’ve had a couple issues since Including the elbow hose under the hood which was causing it to spray coolant out and my car would overheat. Got that fixed and since then I’ve only had to replace a wheel bearing and my gas line. It’s been very reliable and surprisingly good on gas. Something to look out for on these cars is the transmissions. On the base model (which I have) they are better, but I’m at 274xxx kms right now and my engine has been on and off starting to clunk for the past 20k......also is doing this thing when I reach around 80mph is starts rocking back and forth and almost seems like it’s bogging, but after accelerating a little it stops. It’s very easy to fix things on these cars, and I’d say they’re good starter cars. "
pontiac,grand-prix,2005,Colby Barbour, 08/27/2020,Really good starter car,5,"I bought this car with 194,000 miles and now it has 218,450 miles. The radio and back right window motor was replaced around 100,000 miles. Car runs smooth and it starts pretty good in cold conditions. One problem I have had while owning it is the dash rattling. Whenever this car goes up my driveway which is dirt here in virginia, everything starts to rattle. this car is in almost perfect condition.

pontiac,grand-prix,2006,dcole08, 04/14/2013,2006 Grand Prix GT Supercharged,4,"I have had this car for over 2 years now, and I must say I love it. I honestly don't know how I stumbled upon it because I was initially looking for either a Maxima, or a Charger. Somehow I stumbled upon this car and it is awesome. It looks awesome and turns heads all of the time because it is different. Mine (all black with black interior) is rare where I am and I haven't seen one like it around. People love riding in it, and my wife loves to drive it. It's very comfortable to drive, and I have never had any issues with it. The 3800 motor in it is a legend in the car world, and mechanics salivate when they see the 3800 v6 it wrapped with headers and a supercharger."

No mechanical trouble except basic maintenance and 1 thermostat. Paint stood up well to the test of time. Only thing interior wise is my dashboard cracked a little way up by the window. Other than that, stayed great. Seats didn't tear, rug didn't wear out. The engine gave you enough power to get where you needed to go quickly. I wish Pontiac had stuck around. I would have bought another. "
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,06gp, 12/20/2011,2 year Evaluation,4,"Bought my 06 Grand Prix back in 2009 and it has served me well. the 3.8L is very reliable, powerfull, and sounds amazing once the hammer is dropped. The ride is very comfortable, no complaints there. The exterior is gorgeus, sexy if I may say. Interior material quality: The cheap plastics, thanks GM, is ok but very difficult to shine up and keep good. In the future I will customize the interior with Blk leather and dark wood trim so that will be my solution. Fuel economy is great highway wise (28mpg), the city is satisfactory if you don't speed and suddenly accelerate. Repairs: Just a alternator and a upcoming brake job. 18+car= havoc. Overall I am very impressed with my Pontiac and love it."
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Bob, 06/07/2009,Wonderful Pontiac,4,"2 1/2 half years experience, 31500 miles.  Replaced the battery this week, no other issues. Changed Bridgestones for Goodyear Eagle F1 A/S - 10,000 miles on the Goodyears, just do it. Upgrades - K&N Series 63 intake system, Magnaflow muffers (yeah they sound mean), upgraded floor mats and piano black dash trim kit.  Adding LED taillights soon.  White exterior/sand ultra lux leather interior.  No Nav or optional paint.  A+ build quality. Have some fun?  Disconnect the battery overnight - drive the GXP hard the next day over several drive cycles.  Becomes a REAL hot rod (I promise). Rare model - turns heads.  Almost 20 mpg town w/27 highway. Wanna race?"
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,218, 06/25/2013,Review after 4 years of reliable and fun performance,4,"I aquired my 2006 Grand Prix(base) in March 2009 and I have to say it is an excellent performer and reliable daily driver. In the time that I have owned my Gp, I have had little to no problems with it.

 The car can definitely makes a daily drive exciting with it's 200hp-230 torque as it has defeated many a foe. It also responds very well to modifications, I've placed a CAI, ZZP 304 SS headers, downpipe, and catback with Flowmaster Super 44s. It sounds badass to finalize. 
 My friends praise its quickness and superb ride quality on the road, its a bliss to drive daily and a joy when the go-pedal is abused.

In short, it is an excellent car and I would reccomend one to all."
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,D. Goodrode, 07/21/2006,Great Automobile,4,"Just purchased it, love it, sharp looking in the Stelth Gray, quiet, comfortable, solid, and handles good on twisty roads. Only 200 horses but more than enough, keeps up with all but the quickest sedans costing twice as much. Looks of a European sedan, comes standard with tons of gadgets. The electronics can be customized to your own taste. This is a classy automobile. Many creature comforts and fold down rear seats for extra long items. Many 2006 improvements on the engine and trans. The 3.8 V6 has tons of torque coupled with the medium duty (not light) 4L65-E trans is a great combo. No I'm not a dealer, I'm the son of a son of a mechanic and appreciate a well built automobile.

I had absolutely no problems with this car besides regular maintenance like oil change, tire rotation, the usual stuff. I wasn't a big fan of the dark teal colored pain job, and interior is pretty boring, but the quality of this car is a keeper for sure! **I'm sorry, I was at the shop one time, this is when I first bought it, I had to get my water pump replaced, but that was it..."

And far the money, you get an awesome vehicle! I am very impressed by the gas mileage I achieve, I am averaging 27.5! Now keep in mind, this is a V8! Very responsive! Very quick for a midsize sedan.

pontiac,grand-prix,2006,pontiacmall, 10/03/2012,Realiable is the way,3,I purchased this car 2 years ago with the intention of having it temporarily and then trading it in. It has proven to be realiable after I added another 60k to the odometer. Just recently had issue with heater core which caused no heat and air. Once fixed it worked like a charm. I also put a twin mattress in the trunck with back seats down and was able to close the trunk. No pick up truck necessary!!May be time to get rid of as the kids are complaining they don't have enough back seat leg room of which I have to agree is a little on the short side. Just hope I can find something as realiable as the Grand Prix.....
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Keith, 10/10/2016,"Not a bad first car these days, but research first",3,"First let me say that this car isn't bad. It's a very comfortable car, and mine came with bucket seats which are very cozy. The sound system is great, mine came from the dealership with Bose speakers that are very crisp and clear. However, the interior/entertainment is not where my issues are. I am constantly having to replace/repair something on this car. In the 3 years I've had it, I've replaced the front tie rod, the exhaust, the thermostat, the rotors twice, the brakes 3 times, among others. This car is starting to not be worth the trouble. Not to mention the very mediocre gas mileage compared to newer cars. I drive very conservatively (partially due to the fear of breaking something else) and the most MPG I've ever gotten out of this car was 26 miles and that was 100% highway driving for 280 miles. It's a very comfortable car, but like my other Grand Prix that I had before this one, it's a money pit after a while. Make sure to do your research.

pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Jim Maus, 10/22/2005,Motown Metal,5,The aluminum V8 is the heart and soul of this car.  It weighs about the same as a V6 (especially with those gorgeous light weight aluminum rims)!!  I got 25 mpg on my first measured tank.  Everyone loves the seats.  I came out of court once and about 6 lawyers were gathered around and gawking at it (with admiration)!  Some of them spent much more and got less!!

With the excepition of the tight back seat, i have no complaints.  The interior is very roomy, but the backseat leg room is less than my old saturn.

When I bought mine I was led to believe it was in almost perfect condition. All I knew was that is had a bumper crack and that was all. But two weeks after owning it the battery went dead on me and that led to all my problems. Now here I am 10 months later and almost $2,000 into the car. And now I have to get rid of the car as now the transmission has gone out on me and I do not honestly feel like putting more money into it. I love this car so much don't get me wrong. I love the look and the speed from the supercharger. But I can't keep dumping money into it. I just thought I'd share my story and to tell people don't shy away from this car! Just be careful when buying.

The price was the deciding factor, it was cheaper than all others.
I would have bought another Bonneville but they were discontinued.
The car is fast for the price.
I would recommend simply on the low price.

A major improvement over the 1999 GP I used to drive.
Supercharged 3800 Series III V6 strong in all situations, timed 6.4 seconds 0-60, has V8-like punch at highway speeds.
Light steering at low speeds, firms up nicely at higher speeds.
Fuel economy impressive considering available power. Suspension Euro-style firm, but good bump absorption and no harshness.

Interior markedly better than my '99 GP, soft touch materials and extremely comfortable front buckets.
Highway ride serene, minimal tire noise and wind rush, engine growls when revved, almost silent at cruise.
Fold down rear and front passenger seats convenient."
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,tonkota, 06/02/2008,Supercharged fun & good mileage,4,"Very nice car for the money.  GM needs to change the softy shifting for a car with this much torque.  And I love the torque!  The last highway trip I took with 4 adults we got 31mpg.  Not bad considering the ups and downs and the weight of the passengers.  Room enough for 4 pretty easy.  The front seats fit me very well (I'm a wider type of guy).  25k on it now, and no rattles yet."

It's fast and stylish and gets pretty good gas mileage.  Although good, I have to clarify the mileage rating as was given in a few of the other ratings.  This car has never averaged 30 mpg for me, and I live 7 miles from my job.  My trip computer indicates 21 mpg (avg) on good days, 17 if I get on it hard.  The trip computer will show avg, instant, and range mpg info.  It's good, but not that good.  Still, for the size of its motor, it's weight, and the hp rating, it's plenty good for me.  It provides a very smooth and stable ride and can hold the road very well for its weight."

The Grand Prix is not the largest sedan I have driven nor does it have the most powerful engine, but this car basically drives and feels like a real 4-door sedan - comfy and very easy to drive, good acceleration, and it passes Sunday drivers with authority.  Idle is barely noticeable; the road and wind noise is also low.  Steering has some play in it, which I prefer because one doesn't have to grip the wheel so hard to keep it in a straight line.  Brakes are mushy, but work very well.  Interior and body are ""dated"" but I love the symmetrical look (especially the hood).  Dashboard offers many features and functions."

The styling is great and I love the way the seats wrap around you and hold you in. Not to mention the gauge layout is fantastic! I can't say enough about this car.

I've had absolutely no mechanical or body issues, and it's been very dependable. The interior is typically-sporty as only Pontiac can do, but the ride is also very comfy for a sporty car. The body color is a blueish/green that changes to purple, and it gets attention. The most impressive thing is the back seats folding down, giving me plenty of room to haul. I actually packed (12) 8-foot long shelf pieces, plus closet poles and (8) furring strips into one trip. I guess I don't need a pickup truck after all. Overall, very happy."

Decent ride for a car with a performance suspension and low profile tires. Fuel economy is lower than shown on window sticker. I'm sure the car was tested under normal driving conditions but what fun would it be to drive this car slow? As I said there is no substitute for American v8 power."

Excellent handling for a FWD. Understeer is safer for the average driver. Fit, Finish, all the extras, big truck, room for the kids.

pontiac,grand-prix,2006,SciMjr, 03/25/2006,Must be a GXP ... don't skimp!,4,"The 2005 Grand Prix GXP is my first new car & I LOVE IT!!!  I have black exterior with the Ebony Suede/leather interior.  LOTS of power and you have to learn how to step on the gas w/o chirping the wheels!  If you are planning to FLOOR the gas at the light you must hold the wheel because there's a little torque steer and the wheel will try to jump.  Not a big problem.  Interior is very nice and the two front seats are very comfortable in my opinion.  I love the cockpit design; all radio & climate controls are angled to the driver.  I feel the back is roomy and I am 6' 1"" ... the seats are a little hard though.  Gas milage is good for a V-8 but I do 10 mile runs so it may be off for me."

Holds the road like glue, goes like a bat out of hell, stops on a time. Sorry for the cliches, but they're all true. And my price was below 28 grand for a totally loaded v8 rocketship that is quiet and dependable. "
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Bryant, 05/20/2006,Give American a Break!,4,"Granted this is a front wheel drive with 303 HP and paddle shifters on an automatic. But this is one fun car to drive, and on road trips, it is delightful. Even the fuel economy is good. First, it burns regular gas, second it has the fuel saving engine and at road speeds, 4 cylinders shut down and seamlessley start up again when you hit the accelerator. With Stability Control, Magni Steer, and Full Time traction control, Plus the fantastic Heads Up Display, this is a safe car to drive. Just listen to the sound of the Small Block V-8, and you want to ride all day. Gas mileage, I am heavey footed but still getting 25 in Hiway, and 17 to 20 in mixed. That is 400 miles on a tank of gas. Try it!"
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,GERALD BRAY, 05/23/2006,MY GXP,4,"Of all the words theres none so fine as these last three, i got mine. We love love love our gxp. Test drove an ss impala, theres no comparison. The suspension and brake differences in the gxp are destined to give this car a reputation head and shoulders above the rest.12 In town 20 highway came as a surprise, but we're still happy with our choice. Comfort,speed, handling, and style are a cut above the rest. It will even outrun last years 5.7Liter gto."
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Willard Jones, 06/03/2006,Don't know what your missing,4,"First I don't know why I don't see more of these vehicles on the road. I traded a 2005 grandprix GT for this model and it is a totally different experience. The power is awesome, it's definitely there when you need it. Handling is great. I really enjoy traveling with the GXP. It gives a smooth quiet ride and along with the premium sound system it's a joy. I chose a cherry metallic color for this car and I'm constantly getting excellent comments on the color and the style.. Now nothing is perfect. The rear seating is a bit tight. I'm 6'3 and I need the seat all the way back, leaving little or no leg room for the back seat."

pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Dayelilly, 11/09/2006,This GP is awesome!,5,"We have owned our new Grand Prix less then a month and it is awesome! Really fun to drive, hugs the road and your flying before you realize it! All the instruments are turned toward the driver which makes it easy to use the a/c, heat or radio. There are ""6"" air vents on the front dash! The profile of this car is fun and sporty! You really couldn't ask for more car or features for the money! All the power you need and a great ride! Pontiac needs to advertise this car more! We didn't go in to buy a Grand Prix but one test drive and we were hooked! Looking forward to some fun trips on the road."

Then I HEARD this car pulling into the lot.  From there I was in Ahhh.  But to get behind the wheel of this Powerful V8, what a dream.  This is my third Pontiac (others were Grand-Am GT's) and they have done something Right with this GXP.  I put 32,000+ miles on it the 1st year I owned it.  Its a great highway car.  I love to take it out to the deserted stretches of straight rural roads, and let her loose."
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Queenie, 09/27/2016,Black Beauty 06 GXP - Time to say Goodbye,4,"When I first bought this vehicle 6/14 everything seemed fine-until I had it for about 1.5 months and the brakes went bad. Took it back to the dealership and they replaced them without replacing the drilled rotors (I found out much later). Not even 8 months and I dont drive this car hard.  I am replacing drilled rotors and premium brake pads. Later on down that line, I have replaced serpentine belts(2x), water pumps, it has accessive oil consumption (small oil leak). There is a noise when I drive under my car that I can not get rid of (no one seems to know what it is). I have replaced throttle, battery (within a year of buying it). Now, the Torque converter clutch is going bad.   This is my second grand prix. My first was a GT V6, I had absolutely no problems with that vehicle which I bought used at 75k miles and sold it at 110k miles. I will have to part ways with this current vehicle.  Sad to see it go.

pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Seth, 04/25/2009,Pontiac Got Outclassed...By itself,2,"I got a lease and I just recently turned it in and got a new lease on a Pontiac G8. And man, everything the GP does right, the G8 does so much better and all the flaws from the GP vanish. But this is for the GP, though.  The Grand Prix is a great car just to push the the limits. But when it comes down to business, it did terribly. I bumped my head in the back, causing the sunroof to get dislodged. I had a headache and a car repair bill. I was so mad.  Also annoyances include archaic stereo system that looks like my old 1998 Grand Am. It's ugly inside and out. I was not satisfied at all."
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,GXP owner, 07/13/2005,exciting car,4,I have had the vehicle for over 2 weeks and the GXP version is awesome. Has outstanding V-8 and it really goes. Looks are headturning
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,shoeguy72, 08/08/2007,Not so family oriented,2,"My supercharged Grand Prix seemed like the most practical way to go for me, since I needed a ""ffamily oriented"" vehicle that has more than 2 doors, and I wasnt willing to take the leap off the cliff to the minivan, but now that I've owned it for 5 months, I realize how impractical this is for a family vehicle. Too low to the ground which makes car seats a real pain in the butt, rides hard, Black leather interior always makes the car warm, and it has lost so much of its value already retailed for 23k when I purchased it, and dealerships wont give me more than 13k on trade 5 months later? I'd never buy one of these again."
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Diane, 08/22/2010,Extreme oil consumption,4,"I was so excited when I purchased this car.  It was everything I wanted and still do.  However, around 54,000 miles in (I purchased it when it only had 100 miles) I  took my car in for a oil change.  No problem, then less than a 1000 miles my check oil light came on.  I took it back to the shop that changed my oil and was told that there was NO oil in there.   I am now at 73,000 and continue to have problems and Pontiac has been ""working on it"" for this entire time.  Going in for service every other month is time consuming.  I drive less than 15 miles to work per day and am using a quart of oil every 1000 miles. Hoping for a solution because I sure love the care otherwise.  "
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,dave, 11/08/2005,Vibration that won't stop,4,"Overall, I like my GP although it has been in the shop 3 times in the 1 month since purchase.  There is a vibration in the front that the dealer cannot repair.  After balancing, new tires, full alignment and rebalancing, the vibration persists.  So far this experience does not make me a happy customer.  I may have to go back to Chrysler products to be satisfied. Any ideas to fix the vibration before we have to replace all the rims to try that?  HELP!  I like the car but dont need the vibration."
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Roy, 01/20/2006,GXP,3,I love the GXP it's nice to look at and handles well. It's tight suspension sometimes is tuff on the ride. The sound system is the most dissapointing as it lacks mid range and the bass is way too much as I have turned it down to minimum. The nav system works pretty good. Acceleration is good but off the line the tires turn into smoke and ya lose a lot of traction. Torque steer is less than my Eldorado so IM pleased with that.
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Lara the Superhero, 02/24/2006,Pontiac is Great!,5,"It is a magical, beautiful car that I like very much. It is very very pretty and it flies like the wind. It handles very well on all types of roads. "

I looked at a Honda Accord at 8:30 this morning and was driving a Pontiac GXP off the lot by 12:30 this afternoon.  There is just something about that throaty V8 and the wrap around cockpit that says ""this feels right!""  It has the clothes of a sports sedan, but is undoubtedly a legitimate muscle car.  My advice is if you're going to buy an Accord, Maxima, or high- end Altima, don't test drive this car... you'll never look back...  Pat"

Unfortunately, even with the high performance and fun driving factor, I will Never own another Pontiac and I have owned Numerous Pontiacs over the past 40 years. With fewer than 11K-miles, Pontiac had to replace the throttle-body which left me stranded on the freeway for 2 hours. With fewer than 13K-miles, I had to pay out of pocket for front brake pads And Disc Rotors; almost $700! I had to replace those Awful Bridgestone tires on front with Kumhos at the same time as the brake fix! I drove it from coast to coast right after the Disc replacement and it started scoring the front rotors Again! Neither the dealers involved not Pontiac was of any help!"

Seems that ""Dan"" the editor must have had a rough day or just doesn't like Pontiacs. Anyways, I've had my share of Fords, Dodges, and VW's etc. and to date this is the best car for the money I've driven. No squeaks rattles or odd engine problems, just perfect."
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Cdoes, 12/03/2008,Poor Build Quailty,3,"Prior to owning this base model I had a 2000 GTP model which was very reliable up past 100k miles. One word of advice- Buy a 2007/2008 model where the powertrain warranty is 100k miles instead of 35k or GM certified used. I bought this car used with 8k miles from a Subaru Dealer....Everything was fine until the factory warranty ran out at 35k miles, at the point I knew I should have bought one with an extended warranty....At 41k miles the A/c system stopped working, $765.76 out of pocket.....49k miles I was driving and the car lost first/2nd gear.....Tranny rebuild- $2,109 out of pocket.....Right now the heater has stopped working as well as the front wheel hubs need replaced...."

I have to say, that with this new Grand Prix, I felt so secure with the purchase because the engine is just exceptionally dependable and easily modified. I'd never owned a GP like this one, and so far I absolutely love it. Easy to maintain, smooth shifting, and somewhat powerful(could use some mods though). I can't wait for dual exhaust, short RAM intake and my new hood. I have to say that the shifty squeaking/clicking I get in the steering column is something I could do without though.  The factory sound system is more than I expected, with more than enough bass to keep me happy for a while.  "
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Timmy1988, 12/18/2008,Grand Prix,5,"This car has been a pleasure to own. I have had it since new, and recently was in a head on collision. These cars are very safe. I came out of a head on collision with a very minor injury to my hand and my passenger was perfectly fine. This car's performance was outstanding. I had a K&N filter on my engine the rest was stock. The car was fast and efficient. I could go 0-60 in 6.3 seconds and my average economy never droped below 28mpg so the economy stats on this car depend on the way you drive it. At the floor you get 4.3mpg and at 59mph with the cruise set you will get 31-35mpg. I personaly think that these cars have too much power for their size, and to think this is coming from a 20year old. Thanks . "

Nope. Wouldn't have bought it if I'd known it wasn't those. I love the car, but really hate the annoying shake. Feels like an engine miss, but it isn't that either. Would love to find out what it is. Can't figure out how to get the stereo to show names of songs and singers again as it did when I got the car."
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Jack, 01/12/2009,Grand Prix- Welcome Back !,5,We shopped around before buying the 2006 Grand Prix. It has met or  exceeded all our expectations so far. I bumped my head the 1st time I got in the back seat. We were surprised how roomy and confortable the back seat was after reading mixed reviews and remembering to duck. This our 4th car with the 3.8 litre v6. We would have to say it's one of the best engines ever built. We bought the base model and are very happy with the acceleration. Wow what a great car!

Have owned 43 cars in long life, and the 75,76, and 77 Grand Prix SJs w/big block engines were the best. Had 1 of each yr and each one accumulated 90k miles..took a beating and never complained..  Current 2006 is nothing more than a Monte Carlo, rebadged GPGT.

pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Ian, 10/29/2009,Great for a Pontiac,4,"Great engine.  Cheap interior (and mine's fully loaded), but you know that going in with Pontiac.  Electric steering's a bit non-responsive and then over-corrects (this is only an issue on sharp turns; no issues on highways, etc).  If you're a confident driver you won't notice the problem, and the GT corners really well (and is generally fun to drive) for a car its size.  At night when the road's wet or icy and you're taking a sharp turn the steering makes you feel a bit out of control.  That's far from a deal breaker (and my commute is 17 miles on winding country roads in the northeast).  Overall love the car and definitely recommend.  Bought GM Certified in August - no problems."

Plenty of power, it effortlessly gets up to hwy speeds. It has the crystal blue paint which changes to teal in the sun and can appear purple at time in dimmer light.  Reliability has not been an issue with this car and I'd definitely get another if they still made them. GM got this one right and reliability seems to be hard to find these days. I'd also consider the Aussie built G8 as they've been around along time Down Under. "

None of my Japanese cars ever sounded like that! It has great pickup and pretty good fuel economy. It's fun to drive. The inside is comfortable and the service I get from the dealership is awesome...free oil changes as long as I own it.  I got the car loaded with everything and still got a great price with the employee pricing.  I could never have gotten a Japanese car with all the features for the price I paid.
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,James Maus, 10/21/2005,American Built,4,"I drove a G6 and loved the tight body.  The GXP is not as tight, but the V8 power is awesome.  I disagree with Edmunds because they aren't factoring in price and gas mileage.  The Charger may be a better car, but it's a new model.  Grand Prix has been around a few years.  Also, the Charger, which is much heavier doesn't get 28 mpg on the highway (GXP does if you use cruise control).  Also, I got a loaded GXP for 28000.  A similarly equipped Charger would go for 35000, and OnStar isn't even available!  In an other 18 months, I am going to get the G6 GXP!!"

I looked at the Charger a lot and was almost set on it when a friend persuaded me to test drive a GXP based on what he had read about it online.  I took his advice and ended up getting one just weeks later. Everything everyone has already written here is true.  I leased because I want to wait to see about the reborn Camaro and Challenger in a few years.  But regardless this is a sweet car.  I'm 23 and I love driving it.  It feels and looks like a sports car despite its sedan heritage.  Loud, fast V8...good old American muscle.  What's not to love?"
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Kichigai, 01/19/2006,Grand X-iting Prix,4,"Driving this car is a lot of fun, I don't recommend test driving it if you aren't interested in purchasing it, because you will after. The guys at the dealership love when someone test drives it. I was looking for a vehicle in the $20,000's and drove a few, but after seeing the GXP and the test drive the next day, yeah I went back, I forgot all about the civic si, mazda rx-8 and saturn redline. It handles great and all components are easily reached by the driver, which is bad for passenger because they will have to lean to use any of them. My gas consumption has averaged about 19-20 mpg so far, even all highway. I hope this changes as the engine breaks in.  "

pontiac,grand-prix,2006,guy, 06/14/2006,Fast and Versatile,4,"So it's a low-life's dream car, so what?  It has many assets: Much cheaper than the Volvo S60R I was also looking at, expressive appearance, dark cherry red exterior, cool rims, black leather interior, smooth ride, lots of cargo space, and rumbling 303hp V8 that runs on 4 cylinders for 28 mpg when cruising.  And fun to drive, with great acceleration, control and braking.  On downside, w/ my ht, driver's seat must be tilted back so I don't hit roof.  Also, headrest is fixed parallel w/seat back, so it's too far back to be of use even if seat weren't tilted.  Was car designed for Neanderthals, or should I drive with a racing helmet? I just slouch along, but somehow it works for me."

This car is impossible to drive in the winter because of the performance tires. The car comes with two different size tires, 255/45R 18 front, and 225/50R 18 rear. I have spent hours on the internet to try to find a set of all-season tires. I have also checked with local tire dealers in my home area.

The gas mileage is great for a big car, and it has plenty of power, plus the 3800 v-6 is a great engine, will last forever!  The car is a blast to drive, I am 6'8"", and I have plenty of room.  The backseat is a little tight, but you can't have everything.  My wife has a BMW, and we both enjoy driving this Grand Prix much better than the BMW, which costs over double!

If you've never driven one, check it out soon!"
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Drew, 08/21/2006,Unbeatable for the money,5,"This car has been great.  I've had it for a year and put about 24,000 miles on it, without a single problem.  V8 is awesome, and gives mid-20's gas mileage (mixed driving, but more highway).  Looks great in black.  Got it loaded with options for under 30k. Very comfortable car for me (5'6""), and everybody else I've ever had in it.  Car rides, brakes, and handles very well.  I'd recommend this car to anybody, at least drive it before spending comparable money on an Accord, etc."
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,GM Convert, 07/29/2005,No more Hondas for me!,5,"After an accident I got a Grand Prix as a loaner.  Turning the key & hearing the rumble of the twin exhausts got my undivided attention.  Good acceleration, gas mileage & style won me over!  The V6 Accord & Camry get about the same mileage but both look like Grandpa-mobiles!  Initial quality is great-Ive not been back for anything to repaired-my Accord had many trips back!  Upkeep is less & the insurance rates are lower than my superior Honda.  The GT is the best value w/extra toys, traction control, antilock brakes & twin exhaust.  One rental week converted me I havent owned a GM car in 20 years but I dont think Ill ever consider another foreign car again this one is too good!"
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,TonyGXP, 08/03/2005,GET 1,4,"I found this vehicle to please me more than any other performance car I've ever owned & I can put 2x4's in it!! Ride is a little stiff but that is expected for the handling you get in return. Avg fuel economy is 18.0 MPG thats mostly city driving, short trips & occasional beating (hard not to, its so fun)"
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,mikie22, 08/07/2005,Great driving car,4,Fantastic! Excellent handling and it gets better miles per gallon then the v- 6 I traded in (25mpg). Sport red is just right and Onstar is great.
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,James, 08/18/2005,GXP = WOW,5,I went into to drive and buy a G6 GTP and drove off with a GXP.  The hiway mileage is great...My first measured tank got 25 mpg...with a 300 hp V8!  It is incredibly quick....be ready for a real jolt when you put the pedal down.  I got the employee discount. A lot of people notice and ask quesions about it.  
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Jen, 09/04/2005,Great Sports-Family Car,5,"My first car was a Pontiac, so I am partial to the brand. I LOVE this car! It is stylish, sporty and fun to drive. I get great gas mileage and have a lot of room in the front, either riding or driving. The back is roomy, unless you put the front seats back. It cramps little legs. We have two booster seats in the back and if you want to fit a third person, you have to remove one of the seats to be comfortable."
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,joseph neese, 09/06/2005,grandprix gt,2,"I recently bought a gp gt and i love the way it looks, but i've been having problems with everything from tires to gas, wheelbearings just everything.  I only have 8000 miles on my car the best gas mileage i've gotten is 400 miles to the tank that's bad, i got better with my 90 model pathfinder. i work for a gm dealership and none of the techs can find out what the deal is."
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,mIKE57, 10/04/2005,Just Loving It,4,"Bought GXP and have never looked back. Most fun and exciting drive I have had in 20 years. Great ride, handling, accel and got almost 27mpg on hwy trip. Why did it take Pontiac so long??? My 5 year old loves it."
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,HMT, 11/28/2005,Love this car!,5,"Smooth, powerful and, best of all, my wife loves it. I can't get the keys from her. I promised her I'd buy a sporty car and this is it. "
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,candice, 12/03/2005,Review,3,Love car other than minor defects that we have come across that dealerships seem to not be able to fix such.  The car acts like it's going to die at times or stall out.  We have taken it 6+ times and dealer ship never fixes the problem.
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Irish, 01/17/2006,06GrandPrixGT,4,"I drove a 97 GTP for 8 years and loved it so I was reluctant about the new style but when the 06 came out with more power and options in a GT I traded up.  This car can fly.  I've driven the Magnum RT and the Grand Prix is faster off the line.  Smooth ride, corners well.  90 degree doors in the rear are nice for kids getting in and out.  I would recommend buying one without a sunroof as it adds much needed headroom.  Leg room in the rear is a little tight but seats are more comfortable than the 04/05 versions."
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Snowman, 02/17/2006,Wow. Awesome car.,5,"Much much better than I expected. Tried ALL midsize cars, both foreign and domestic and this was the clear winner. Fast, quiet, handles excellently at both high speed and low. Tracks very well. Excellent stability system and the brakes drag you to a stop faster than an aircraft carrier landing deck. If you have a bias against the Pontiac name, I suggest you try this car. My Saab-loving wife drove it once and decided that this was the best car going for the price -- 27,600$ with leather and airbags and a few other toys. "
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,ncix1, 02/19/2006,Third Times the Charm!,4,"As this Ameican's love affair with SUVs wanes, it was a pleasant suprise to test drive a ""real car"". After having owned (okay leased) one of the first 200 supercharged GTP's off the assembly line for the 1997 model year and later trading that for a limited edition ""Daytona 500"" GTP the new GXP comes out way on top. It is a shame I had to stumble accross it while the wife was test driving the new Soltice. She also is impressed, with the looks, power and feel of our new Grand Prix. If she wasn't I'd be looking at convertible ""garaging"" the rest of the winter out. Pontiac states you may not be happy with the ""beasts"" snow manners, quite the contrary in the 3-4 inches we got caught in.    "
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Cyndi, 03/02/2006,I like my car,4,"I purchased the car in early summer.  The AC and heat both work very well, interior is very comfortable.  It is also a nice riding car, heavy enough to feel secure on the highway.  It also has nice pick-up for highway driving.  I now have about 10,000 miles and have had no mechanical problems.  I am very happy.  "
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,rolex4me, 03/02/2006,Mid-Size Muscle,4,"As a grand Prix fan, I must say that I am impressed with the 2006 GXP. It not only beats its competitors on paper, it beats them on the pavement. Great handling, a true driving machine. This car makes the daily commute a little more pleasurable. One will not be disappointed with this choice, a true head turner."
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,jeff, 03/04/2006,not bad for a v8,4,wow! talk about power in a front wheel drive ... let's just hope the year of the v8 has no problems :)
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,PFWiz, 03/07/2006,4 Door Corvette,4,"If you want a truly quick 4 door car with a nice size trunk and you know that rear wheel drive just doesn't cut it in the snow belt then the GXP may be the car you are looking for. Blazing fast (Car & Driver says 14.3 seconds in the quarter) with very good handling for a large front wheel driver. Yes, I know rear wheel drive is better for 10/10s driving, but be honest how often do you drive 10/10s? On the other hand I drive in the snow every winter and front wheel drive wins hands down there. The Heads Up Display is a hoot and watching it display direction to your destination from the nav system is extremely cool. Build quality pretty good, nice even gaps, no squeaks or rattles."
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Swave232, 03/07/2006,Love My GT!!!,4,"I love what they have done with the 2006 model. If you get a chance to get the leather interior I would highly suggest it for max comfort. The back seat room is totally fine and the sun roof does not crowd the head space. I am 6 foot 2 and can sit in it with much ease. (Also have a wife and a 19 month daughter that are able  to sit very comfortably as well. If you are looking for a stealth design with some need for speed while still being able to up hold some class, the GT version is the way to go hands down without breaking your pockets."
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,hillmankc, 03/16/2006,Great car!!,5,"Purchased GXP after much research. It is AWESOME - just as the other GXP owners say it is! It has nice styling cues borrowed from classic Pontiacs of the past (turned-aluminum style dash, fender vents from 2nd generation TA's), but is not a rehashed ""retro"" car. I believe this FINALLY is the car Pontiac had in mind when they presented the Grand Am in 1973: a sporty sedan with performance that surpasses imports costing many $$ more. Handling is superb; build and paint are outstanding; interior look and feel are nice, especially compared to GP's of a few years ago. Cabin is ultra-quiet, until you hit that gas pedal! This car is the proverbial ""iron fist in a velvet glove""! Love it! "
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,DrDre413, 03/18/2006,Best Grand Prix Ever,4,"As the 3rd time owner of a grand prix, I must say this is the best one ever. I had an 01 GT, and 03 GTP, and now an 06 GXP. They just keep getting better. This is just a great car all the way around. Acceleration is great, looks are nice too, and interior is much better this time around. Pontiac really has a winner with this one. Keep up the good work!"
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Mr. Hyde, 03/20/2006,"Holy COW, this car is great!",5,"Drove every other car in its class and this one came out on top by a HUGE margin. Super engine, quiet, awesome driving position and seats. Very good mpg and incredible brakes.  Consumer Reports rated this car poorly. I think they must have hit their heads on a few washing machines. This car is FANTASTIC. Try it, then see if you agree with me. The GXP is an animal. "
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,California Boy , 03/30/2006,I Totally DIG this car!,5,"Wow. I was going to buy an Acura and on a complete whim I tried this Grand Prix. THIS AINT NO RENTAL CAR!!!  This thing is fast, smooth and very quiet. Better than an Acura or Audi in my opinion. Snotty Beverly Hills people might not drive one, but that is their problem! Excellent Job, GM! "
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Sexy Tina, 03/30/2006,I LOVE this animal!,5,"Way too cool. I'm single and 27 and this is my first real car. I LOVE IT!!! I can whoooooosh past anyone on the road and it drives very nicely in the snow and it has the remote start, which I LOVE on cold mornings. LOVE the onstar, love the seats, love the way I can push on the gas and say buh-bye! to all the boys trying to catch me. This car is sleek and TIGHT!  "
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Classical MusicLover, 04/13/2006,"Excellent car. Try it, you may buy it!",5,"I was not in the market for this car until my very wise brother-in-law recommended I take one for a test drive. I traded in my Toyota Avalon that day. This car is very quiet. It handles on rails. I needed a car that had a lot more zip than the Toyota and I found it. I have been a long time buyer of imported cars and while many of those who work at the same University I do smile when I say I bought a Pontiac, I have the last laugh! "
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,thomas carapelho, 04/29/2006,great car,4,"i love this car. it handles like a luxury car and the v6 engine has plenty of power to get up and go. i have 15,000 miles on it and haven't had any complaints except for the dimmer switch wich could have been placed in a more conspicuous place on the dash."
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,AL, 05/15/2006,My Cherry GXP,4,"My family has always liked the Pontiac brand.  The 303 hp V-8 in the GXP has a sound that reminds me of the 50's and it is great experience to drive.  Not as fast as my 1984 Trans-am and not as great as my 2000 Bonneville SSEI, but for the money spent it has it all.  I would recommend this car as a family grocery getter for a sports car guy."
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,GXP_Extreme, 05/17/2006,"Fun & Furious, because Fast is a given!",5,This car is awesome! Who would have thought a car in this price range would be better than most cars on the road. I laugh at the people and their expensive luxury cars with 1/3 less horse power and the same mpg. With this car I can drive like a kid and still drive the kids around. This car is THE complete package for a single/family man (Or woman). Thank you GM for a great car!
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,fly, 05/27/2006,Awesome Looking,5,"What a fun car to drive and look at!  DVD Navigation is is awesome, sound controls on the steering wheel is very helpful.  I Love the HUD, and the ability to adjust the info presented on it."
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,pakeane, 06/12/2006,Salesman's Car,4,"Test drove the ususal mid-size imports along with the GP, after crunching the numbers the GP provides much more value for your dollar. Base drivetrain miles ahead of base imports.  Ample torque across powerband. Purchased for a salesman who travels 20k+ each year in the car (in addition to countless miles via air). Fair city mileage with good highway mileage and manners. Dont be affraid of domestic cars based on that crappy 1987 Oldsmoford you owned. While maybe not as refined as the other options on the market, this is surley a solid car at an attractive price point."
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Karen D, 06/26/2006,Nice Car,5,this car drives nice and handles great. I love all the features it has and easy to work.
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,James Duncan, 08/15/2006,Nice Car,5,This is one fine car it drives like a dream and also rides very nice also good gas mileage I really can't say anything bad about it.
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,dlpVI, 08/24/2006,better than other years,4,"this is the 3rd Grand Prix that I have owned, and I must say that Pontiac got it right this time!! The last Grand Prix that I owned was a 1999 GTP, but this new car rocks. Its fast and rides really nice. The cock-pit is nice and easy on the eyes at night. Everything seems to be in the right place (well other than the dimmer switch). This car was the dealer demo so I got a gr8 deal on it. Was going to buy a Maxima, now that I own this Pontiac, I would not consider owning the nissan now. what more can I say, Ponaic got it RIGHT and now all they have to do is stay there and they will have many happy and loyal customers. I know I will be looking forward to the next new Pontiac to hit the market"
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,grand prix, 09/01/2006,I like it,4,"excellent vehicle, and one I would recommend to others. I bought the base GP, but it has everything I want.  I would like the roof to be a little higher to make it easier to enter and exit.  Powerful engine and smooth ride, much better than Focus I traded in.  Gas mileage is good, but could be better."
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,GT, 09/12/2006,Fun Drive w/rattles,4,"Fun drive! I had a 2000 Grand Prix GT that I loved & traded in at 70,000 mi. The 200HP non supercharged got 20 city- 29 HWY mpg.The '06  260 HP/SC gets 10 city- 24 Hwy,""overall lousy mpg."" Dealer cannot get rid of rattles in rear door panel and sunroof.Anyway, I should have kept the 2000."
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,C. Ruebsam, 09/16/2006,Supercharged Family Fun,5,"I just bought my GP, and my initial take is wow!  I didn't think I would like the car but after driving all the other sedan's on the market the GP was a breath of fresh air.  The styling inside and out is very astheticly pleasing and the ride is awesome to say the least.  So far I am very imprest with the MPG, avg approx. 24mpg, on a supercharged six.  The same car with a foreign name plate would be considerbly moore.  I think anyone in the market for a midsize sedan that wants the luxury, ride, four doors, and fun factor should give the GP a chance. Best value in it's class.  I can't say much about reliability since I just bought it, but given the 05' ratings I think it should be just fine."
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Dan, 10/09/2006,So far so good!,4,"Wanted to get into something a bit cheaper to run than my truck.  This is it.  Originally I was looking at G6 sedans, base 4 banger, only option I wanted was cruise.  This is just so much more car for the money!  Only have it not even 2.5 months and already have 6,500 miles on it.  It is just racking up the miles without a hiccup.  Runs good, gets decent mileage and is just an all-around good ride.  So far no problems.  Headroom could be better, the sunroof eats into it a bit.  With the rebates, if you just need basic transportation, this fits the bill quite nicely!"
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Rapid City Ron, 10/17/2006,"Torque steer, If you say so",4,"First I feel GM should advertise this car, let its virtues be known to the public.  This is no ordinary Grand Prix.  I also own a 2000 GTP Daytona 500 Pace Car with an SLP Performance package. I feel it is far more desirable than an Audi or BMW and I have own both in the past. Performance and comfort are outstanding.  Black in color is desirable.  Mileage if you do 55 mph at speed is closer to 23 to 25 mpg.  Love my Pontiacs.  So far I have not experience torque steer in either GPs.  I know what the experts say but..."
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Mr. Quick, 11/06/2006,Objectively speaking,4,"This is hands down the best Bang-for- the-buck car for the guy/gal who wants to have their sports car cake and eat family car cake too. It is fast and agile for a large car. Features like touchscreen navigation, performance brakes and V-8 power are great. Leather and power everything as well as a load of driver aids and multi- information data tools are awesome. Other things like the standard HUD and remote start are features no other car manufacturers can offer for anything near $30,000! There was no compromise when I traded in my 2-door 345 hp turbocharged sports car for this 4- door family car. 0-60 in 5.7 seconds, 150+ mph (governor defeated, factory halted at 140) Nuff said, go drive one!"
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,woolly, 11/28/2006,This things fast and smooth,5,"Bought the car with 4,000 miles on it, pretty loaded and supercharged. I still have a 1999 Bonneville and I thought it was fast. This car is unbelievable for the money. Looks like an expensive sports car and drives like one. "
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Stan, 12/20/2006,Excellent Purchase,4,"I drove the GXP for a couple of weeks and thoroughly enjoyed the 303 hp and all the gadgets this model comes with. However, with gas prices high, I opted for the 260 hp v6. Still plenty of power and the car is nice looking with comfortable seats."
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Richard Leavitt, 12/31/2006,My new GXP,5,I ordered this car fully loaded. I have not been sorry for one minute. Getting in the car and driving it is a thrill and it makes me forget any problems I may have. The performance is more than adequate. Stepping down on the gas a little makes it seem like it is taking off like a jet. It just wants to move. My first long trip rendered just over 26 mpg which is quite acceptable for a higher performance engine. The only problem I have experienced is the navigation system but I understand this is an overall problem and it doesn't really bother me as there will be a fix for it. The best part of this car is my dealer and my saleslady. A big plus!
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Ben, 01/07/2007,decent all around car,4,This car is great.  The main problem with this car is the tires if you ever have a flat or have to get new ones.  The tire sizes are almost impossible to find.  I had a flat tire and had to wait almost 3 days to get a new one because no one stocked it.  Definitely a bad thing for a daily driver. This car also does not come with a spare tire.  It comes with a tire repair kit which does nothing for an unrepairable tire.  Then comes the gas mileage.  I only drive this car around town mostly and am lucky to average 16 in town and 22 on the highway.  I still only have about 3000 miles on it so hopefully those numbers will improve.  The rear seat entry is pitiful for this cars size.  
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Frankie, 01/28/2007,GT is an Awesome car!,4,"I really Love the Grand Prix, as a former GTO [I have had four of them] owner I am very impressed with the performance of the Supercharged 6 cylinder. The car has a great stereo, dual climate control, heated sets and remote start. A lot of fun to drive! Awesome acceleration with the Eaton Supercharger! 17 inch wheels and wide-track provide a really nice ride."
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,AZEX, 01/28/2007,Great Car for the Money,4,"When my 93 Geo Prizm died we needed a car, and fast.  While the I was not excited about the Gran Prix at first I quickly saw for the money this was great buy.  To get the 3800 V6 in a loaded Gran Prix was a steal compared to smaller foreign makes with 4 cylinders which were priced much higher than the Gran Prix.  The car is fast, hugs the road, and is able to carry the family and all of our gear.  The trunk is HUGE."
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Frankie, 02/05/2007,GT Very Well Balanced-Rocks!,4,"Bought mine end of year with 15,000 miles on it. Never owned a Grand Prix prior to this. I have owned 4 GTO'S. This is the quickest six out there. The Eaton Generation 5 Supercharger Rocks! With the heated seats, remote start, excellent stereo sound and stitched leather interior you cannot go wrong! Since the improvement in GM cars from 2000 going forward, I cannot see why the foreign market is so popular? I have driven the Honda's,Mazda's, etc and find you end up paying a lot more for what? Pontiac has a quality and exciting car here -a real sleeper. If you need too pass or merge on the interstate this car Rocks! Beats any six out there and a lot of the V8's. Excellent all around vehicle"
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Frankie, 02/23/2007,GP/GT Excellent car for the money!,4,"I had been looking to get the Grand Prix GXP but they are hard to find used and insurance costs are higher. I bought my GT model with 15,000 miles on it and could not be happier. The Eaton Gen 5 Supercharger really puts some punch into the 3800 V6. The seats are super comfortable [stitched leather]they are heated, with electric lumbar support. The remote start is great. I drive 95% freeway, so the power is Awesome when you need to pass, or enter the freeway. The ride is very smooth and for a sedan it corners quite well. It is a great combination of Luxury and Performance. "
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Will, 03/03/2007,Great GXP,4,"Agree with others very nice car, fun to drive and all. Otherwise my pick of the 3 new cars to drive at home that have this is the first choice. Have had many Grand Am's GT and also 1973 Grand Am with V8 with 4 spd and this GXP V8 much better as 1973 Grand Am would get scratch shifting into 4th gear at 90+ MPH but Grand Prix GXP with 4 dr. is much better all around car. Happy with purchase.  Was considering Toyota Camry Hybrid but ""The Fun"" and not a commuter drone is what this is about.  Some vibration noise in instrument panel at top so put some silicon fixed that, and twice slight noise when take steering hard turn in or out of parking spot but trying to narrow that down to fix.  Thats it. "
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Eddy, 03/18/2007,A real Import Intimidator,4,"I purchased this GT version being less than one year old at a great price. This car has solid feel with no lack of power when required. The interior design is comfortable with all the treats of leather, sunroof and power seat. I enjoy the ride on 17"" tires as it handles well. I came from a Grand AM GT and this feels much better. I went on twisty roads on my way skiing and it was awesome, power to come out of corners on the uphill. You don't need to push this car as it comes on easy. I have had imports before and the 4 bangers don't do it. The V6's are over priced and limited supply. The fit and finish is top notch."
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,tarponking, 04/14/2007,Excellent car for the money,4,"Great car, very responsive. Love the supercharger, love the looks, drive and feel of this car. Plenty of room for family of four. Would love to see better gas mileage. For the price you can't beat this car."
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Jovinski, 05/03/2007,"Great Car, Great Price",4,"Always like the Grand Am, and was looking for a GT when I found this on the lot. Drove it and was in love. It is just a great car! Tons of power, very comfortable. I'm 6'5"" and it's got plenty of room for me. Seats are some of the best I've ever had, had Caddy's, Acura's and Saabs. The leather is top notch and shows no wear. Monsoon sound is incredible, but distorts a little when it's way up. And probably could use more bass. For its size, it drives smaller and corners great! Highway miles are smooth and comfy and the seat heaters are great for my lower back. Climate is strong and works quickly. What a great car."
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Lee, 06/14/2007,Great car for the price,5,"The '06 Pontiac Grand Prix is one of the best buys that Pontiac has in this class. You have comfortable seating for 5 and with folding rear seats that open the trunk area up, a very large amount of area to easily hold many items most vehicles could not even hold in the back seats. This car has ample power and is very agile while handling tight corners. The estimated 30 miles to the gallon highway mileage is accurate since I average 29.8 on the highways i travel often. Take good care of this car and you will have very few problems for years to come."
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,MiaT, 07/29/2007,"It's okay, but...",2,"I'm getting about 16-17mpg around town, and that is without much traffic and long desert roads. Have had the engine bolts tightened and still get rumbling when in idle. Door windows starting to get scratches. Was told they were off centered and will have to be fixed. Air conditioner starting to break too and have an appointment to get fixed also. Not the best vision (blind spots), but have driven worse. Not a lot of head room in back for tall people, but great for kids. Wish I had better things to say about it. I must have gotten the lemon."
pontiac,grand-prix,2006,Q, 08/01/2007,Best bang for your buck,4,"I loved my 2006 Grand Prix GXP the second I drove it. I was looking for something with muscle that could still be somewhat sensible. I have had zero problems with the car, and I still love it. I have the mileage up to almost 23,000 already, and I'm in the thing constantly. The remote start is fantastic! It even has a sensor that detects the outside temperature..so if you remote-start your car on a hot day, the A/C comes on, start it on a cold day, the heat comes on. All in all, my only complaint was lack of tire selection..however, Goodyear is now manufacturing Eagle F1 All-Seasons in the appropriate sizes and they are killer tires. There are several companies that make tires for it.."

Had been seriously looking at the new Mustang, but no more. Acceleration, high speed driving in all conditions, rain snow,(with winter performance Goodyears Eagle Ultragrip GW3 V rated) even city driving in stop and go traffic, the finesse this car has in stopping, lane changing, accelerating makes even the trip to work in heavy traffic almost enjoyable.

It drives smooth and has a very powerfully V6 engine, even though it is only 200hp. Like most Pontiac's, the market is saturated with them, but that doesn't change the fact that it is a cool car to look at. The interior might be my favorite though due to the jet-like details.    "

I trade cars every 2 to 3 years, but this is a keeper. I even bought an extended warranty for 7years and 84,000 miles. Told my wife to bury me in it.  Mileage is not great, but a 400+ mile trip last year netted about 24MPG and not at 55MPH either."

I regret selling it to buy the 2006 Grand Prix GXP I have now.  My old car handled much better and had GREAT fuel economy.  25-30 mpg for my daily driving.  The GXP is getting tops 18 mpg. This is WAY under what I was told. The full size pickup with the same motor is getting 20 mpg. I also have lots of rattles and squeaks in the interior.  It is also dogging and is missing. I am actually thinking about selling it already.  I love the overall look of the car.  It is a definite head turner.   Guess I just got the bottom of the pile on this one.

Gas consumption: 11.6L/100km overall -T/C button near cup holder: I keep getting coffee all over it

Stock tires (Eagle LS) will wear out like you won't believe. I think they are summer-only performance tires. Expect to change them sooner than you hope 

Common problem with steering column getting dried up. It starts to click when you turn -Glove box is so small and inaccessible you can barely keep an envelope in there (it was way bigger in my old Sunfire)  "

The only complaint I have is that I find the gas mileage to be very poor.  I do mostly city driving, and I am averaging 16-17 mpg.  I previously had a Toyota, which did so much better in that area, but this is certainly a much sportier car.  Not really sure why such bad gas mileage."

I find myself driving less than the speed limit!!? just because I want to here the exhaust purr its about time. stereo great as usual with xm but its not  for the  weak with this size engine you need to know what your driving.
pontiac,grand-prix,2007,iamian, 08/17/2012,Great vehicle,5,"This vehicle performs much better then I had anticipated. I had heard so much about the torque steer during acceleration and was very pleased when I actually got behind the wheel and pounded the peddle a few times. There is a fair amount of torque steer but if you have both hands on the wheel its actually very mild. This car also goes very very fast, very very quickly. 0-60 in 5.7 is no lie. The interior is very comfortable. The heated seats and lumbar support make driving long periods almost enjoyable. Gas mileage was a concern for me with the v8 but I see 28-33 mpg pretty consistently when I cruise control around 70-75. The gas mileage you get from this car is based solely on how you drive"

Called GM back furious, they sent me a free oil change. (Like that solved my problem) My sister has a 2007 Charger with sunroof and drives through same car wash with no problems.

First car was a 99' gran prix, 2nd was a 07 Honda Civic (junk), then my 2007 Pontiac gran prix. I rea a lot of harsh reviews before I decided I would get it to find out my self. I actually found my car on Craig's list, risky I know, but 74k mile for $7k is hard to beat for a good looking car. My car does make a water flushing noise under the hood which is pretty annoying but took it to get looked at and said it was alright. Everything in this car is great except the radio which isn't the end of the world. Just could use an update or atleast an aux cord hook up. It drives great, gas mileage is not terrible as my first car was. I would buy this car again if the made another!
"
pontiac,grand-prix,2007,Josh A, 04/21/2016,My first nice car!,4,"To preface, while trying to write this review the review menu would only allow me to pick the V8 model of grand Prix. This review is for the Base Model 3.8L V6.

I had an old terrible Mzda B2500 a while back that I sold to buy this car. So far my experience with it has been mostly positive. 

I'm 6'2 and the car has been able to accommodate my size well. The front and read seat are comfy and have sufficient room in comparison to other cars I've driving. 
My seats are felt and the arm rests / doors are leather. So far the interior has held up really well. 
Thing is as fast as you could want it to be without a turbo in it. Took it to the track and got it up to around 130 mph easy. Thing didn't even break a sweat. Now don't get me wrong, it's not the fastest car in the world but in comparison to all the shotty 4 cyld cars out there this thing can really boogie. 

Pros:
It's comfy, fast as hell, good looking, plenty of trunk space, and has a great sound system on board.  

Cons:
21 mpg in town 25 on the hwy
There is an oxygen sensor right in the way of the middle back spark plug. The only way to remove said spark plug is to remove the catalytic converter and then remove the oxygen sensor that's mounter on the exhaust manifold directly inline with the plug. 
Transmission oil pan gasket is junk.
Terrible visibility on the inside, windows in the back are just to darn small.
No room in the engine bay to work with at all. I gave myself a second degree burn on the exhaust manifold trying to change the serpentine belt. I would almost consider pulling the whole engine to change the head gaskets, there's just to much engine for that tiny engine bay. 
The serpentine belt pops off if you hit a 1 inch deep puddle at 20 mph.
The stock iridium spark plugs are darned expensive turning a $100 tune up into a $180 tune up : /
Rotors will warp if you look at them wrong.


Other than all that the car is great. If I had a choice though I would buy a car with a non-transverse engine with more visibility while driving.

pontiac,grand-prix,2007,CmMichaels, 04/30/2016,Best car yet!,5,"Last year I got a job that required me to have a reliable car that got decent gas mileage, so I took my old pickup that needed weekly maintenance and traded it. When I was offered a trade for this '07 Grand Prix (this is NOT the GXP V8, it's the base model V6). I took her for a spin. When I popped the hood and saw she had the 3.8-litre engine I fell in love on the spot! I've had 3 Lesabres and that engine is my favorite! I've now had the car just over a year, I am the second owner, and apparently, the first owner took good care of her because she has been wonderful. I had to replace the brake pads and one headlight in a year.  My only problem with the car is that I'm fat and over 50, so getting out of a low sitting bucket seat is work. But I can't blame the car for that. Another review mentioned the water flushing sound. My car gets that too. Weird. Harmless but weird. I will soon be selling this because I've found a cherry LeSabre, and the bench seat is more my style. It's been a great car and I will be selling it to someone very lucky indeed.

Edmunds asked me to update my review. I sold the car in May and bought that LeSabre. The new owner called me the other day to tell me how much he loves the Pontiac. I never expected follow-up, but a good experience is worth celebrating. As for the LeSabre, I am in hog heaven! 

I don't think I need to update this again, Edmunds, but thanks just the same.

My siblings who drive Hondas say it's incredible. The ride is smooth, it's extremely comfortable with tons of legroom, the Monsoon sound system is insane, and this thing is FAST. I am in love with this car. There is not one thing more I could wish for, I swear. If you are looking for car, take a look at the Grand Prix. The ratings I gave it are honest, this thing is more fun to drive than my moms Mustang GT. And whoever says there's no back seat room has gone mad. "

First of I have 4 Pontiac (00' GP GT Sedan, 01' GP GTP Special Edition Coupe, 04' Bonneville GXP and my 07' GP GT) I love them all and this one is my second favorite (followed by my Bonny) It is very comfortable, fast, reliable and just overall great looking. I take great care of my cars and they get professionally detailed every other month and I detail them every other month (wash, polish, wax, clay bar, leather treatment, interior protectant and wheel cleaner.

If you have one of these and you make it to 50k miles without replacing the transmission consider yourself lucky. I began having transmission problems at 35k miles and had the tranny fluid changed but still didn't shift right. within 5k miles had to have a new tranny put in. The car never shifted right again."

I found it in this GXP, and at $20k less.  It does 0-60 within .6-sec of the Corvette, and handling is terrific.  The guys in the auto press who whine about torque steer are off base when it comes to everyday use of this car.  Yeah, torque steer is there if you look for it when you push this vehicle to its limit, but it's not a significant factor, and definitely not a problem.  This is a great, fun vehicle that's exceptionally well-designed and well- put-together at a fantastic value.   "

pontiac,grand-prix,2007,Cobo Rodregas, 02/19/2016,"Nothing special, Get one cheap, budget for repairs",3,"This car has been good enough, but only because I got a good deal for it.  

Had a lot of problems with coolant leaks (cheap hose clamps), the turn signal stock malfunctioned and would blind random people (cheap, poor quality part), and replaced the radio right away since the display didn't work, lots of buttons dials that won't light up (non replaceable incandescent bulbs for back lighting!!! GM your cheapness astounds me). 

Its got OK acceleration otherwise performance is pretty meh.  Drives like its much larger than it is, not at all nimble. 

Interior is all cheap plastic, but the fabric on all the seats has held up well. 

Pros:  Most repairs are relatively cheap and easy (even if they are frequent).  Nice smooth ride on the highway. Remote start is a fun feature.  Nice big trunk.  Comfortable ride.

Cons: Coolant problems, Poor quality parts, mediocre fuel economy, dead non-replaceable bulbs for many switches/buttons. 

So in short,   Its an OK car if you aren't freaked out by steam billowing out of the hood, or overheating in the dead of winter.   If this is the car you want, get it cheap.

pontiac,grand-prix,2007,Thunderchicken, 04/09/2007,Best Grand Prix Ever,4,"I have owned several Grand Prixs over the years and have found the '07 GXP to be the best yet. It has a great combination of handling, power and technology. Taking into account the car has a 300+ bhp V8, the fuel economy is very good. I get 26 mpg on the highway and 22 mpg city. I am not lead footed but do lean on it a bit from time to time. I find the build quality to be a bit lacking for the interior but a dash dress up kit really helps.  The only down sides are poor factory tires and massive torque stear under hard excelleration. Pirelli PZero 255/45ZR18 solves the tire problem. Sorry, no solution for the torque stear.  All in all a great, good looking adult sports sedan. Great value"

pontiac,grand-prix,2007,Martin DeBrois, 01/15/2020,"GP~GT .. Awesome, part throwback part head-turner",5,"I picked it up in October (2019) ... It's a GT - Special .. That means it has the thicker, chrome dual-exhausts, all dark grey leather inside, bangin' 250 Watt radio / CD player, with navigation.  The car lot, in Philadelphia I bought it from, for a bit over $5K ... Well those dudes didn't do CRAP with it, after they got it on the trade .. So I didn't write them their good review, on google ... Anywho I got a power-steering leak fixed, got it a desperately needed alignment ... Then after I got it home (in North Carolina) I did a couple other things - - Put some silver rims on it, with hub-centric rings, and with 235/55/17 Kelly tires.  It corners better; because the factory rims these came on were only 17 × 6.5's ... Thin!  My DRG rims are 17 × 7.5's, with 42 offset.  Changed the whole stance, of the car.
It was unique and different, when I got it home, but now it gets comments all the time  :) ...
You don't think these (or a GXP) are bad-a__? 
 My car I was driving previous was a 2016 Chrysler 200C, V6 ... Nice car.
My Grand Prix is metallic red, and sweet! .. After getting a couple little odd noises chased down, and taken care of, I love it .. Still a couple little creaks once in a while ... But I love the size of the car, and how comfortable it is inside.
Old-school GM 4-speed auto trans, but this one shifts pretty aggressively.  
Brings me to ...

Performance:  Yeah this sedan isn't `fast` .. An Audi A8 is fast.  A Charger 392 is fast.  A Taurus SHO (twin-turbo) can even be called fast ... But it's quick!  Very strong between 0 and 50 mph, and in passing maneuvers.
My favorite thing is it has a very American look, about it. .. And nice throaty exhaust growl, when you start it. 
Oh and I got it with only 68K miles, on it! ... Has 72K now.  If you get one it takes a while to learn to drive, and park it - as the car has a long snout ... So be careful.

Yeah it's now a $12000 car ... And I know it's gonna be reliable, for a long time.
The GM W-body has it's roots back a ways .. Back to like 1989 ... But it makes for a wonderful ride, on the freeway, and I'm driving a car that clips the end of one of GM's most successful platforms ... And in three years I'll be driving possibly one of the last Pontiacs.

Not many, left, rolling around ... If you spot one (not beat to sh__ )  - Get it (Any model). .. You can turn it into anything you want  :)

However, once you get past the vroom vroom shiny red race car surface stuff, the disgraceful fuel economy alone is enough to make you list it for sale after a month. Excessive road noise is even worse with the sunroof shade open. The interior especially the headliner feels cheap, even tacky after the new car smell wears off. The worse paint I've ever seen - there seems to be no topcoat or clearcoat as there are hundreds of chips down to the metal after 22k miles. Not worth the ins. and payment.

With the cruise control, we get almost 35 MPG on the highway and have been getting around 23 in the city, but only because we are pretty light on the gas pedal in city traffic. I'm 6-4 tall and comfortable in the driver's seat. Sound system was OK but we put in an after- market XM satellite receiver and in- dash CD.  This car has some get-up-and- go when you need it.  And its appearance is certainly a head-turner.  All my friends who insisted I was making a mistake by buying yet another Pontiac are slowly eating their words after they drive it."
pontiac,grand-prix,2007,Happy buyer!, 06/21/2008,Another satisfied customer!,5,"This is my first Pontiac. I just got this car and am very satisfied with my purchase. My family fits well in it. My husband is 63, son is 62 and Im 56. We all fit with no problems. Stylish looks. Head turner. Many compliments. Drives well. Has get-up- and-go. I got it with power everything. Bought it used with 22k miles. Was a rental. No problems whatsoever to bring up."
pontiac,grand-prix,2007,Frankie T, 06/28/2008,GP/GT is an Awesome Car.,4,"My Grand Prix is a 2007 GT model with all the options.  The Monsoon Stereo with the Six CD Player has been a pleasant surprise. The Monsoon system has Great sound and Balance. I have the Purple Haze Metallic paint with the Sun Roof and Custom Tail pipes. The car's appearance is a Head Turner. The Remote Start, Heated seats and Dual climate control are Great during the Winter Months. The 3800 Series III is an extremely reliable engine. In combination with the Eaton Generation V Supercharger and Electronic throttle control you always have instant Power when you need it. I really like the interior with the stitched leather seats and a Real Cockpit feel for the driver. Much  better then the G6."
pontiac,grand-prix,2007,roxie, 10/25/2008,Hate to leave this lease car!,4,"I have totally enjoyed this pontiac grand prix.  I first had a pontiac grand am for 10+ years and am a die- hard pontiac lover.  This has been very reasonable on gas I think - but I checked today and I think city wise it gets 21 mpg.  I have never checked highway.  Number 1 the car looks grea. I got the bronze metallic which is a head turner.  Then I love that the interior is two tone.  I have been totally spoiled by the 6 CD changer and the sunroof and all the extras - the leather, heated seats.  The only thing I can say about this car is I hate to give up the lease and am thinking of purchasing if the price is right.  "
pontiac,grand-prix,2007,hunter0562, 08/03/2012,$$$,4,"Fun car but everytime I turn around I'm putting money into it. Can't keep tires on it and I've tried different brands. Brakes - reguar maintenance but much more expensive than a regular car. Transmission 1 went out at 84,000. Transmission 2 went out at 120,000 - and I feel the dealer didn't install Transmission 2 correctly (the shift stick was never right) and the dealer didn't do anything for me. Transmission 3 has been great (now at 156,000). Now just had a wheel crack - GM sells them for $700!I found one for $450.

Great fun to drive but be aware of high performance car costs."
pontiac,grand-prix,2007,07gt, 12/11/2008,Great car,4,"I have owned 2 other Pontiacs. My 07 is the best car that I have driven. Plenty of horses, sporty but luxury at the same time. I sell cars for a living at a dealer and when ever we get them used I try to get people to buy this car. I believe they are worth every penny!"
pontiac,grand-prix,2007,jason, 02/18/2009,Decent car for the price,3,"I really think for the sticker price this is by far the best performance your going to get from a new car. The 3.8L supercharged puts down a impressive amount of power, IMO it handles better at high speeds then the Mustang Cobra."

pontiac,grand-prix,2007,squirt03_25, 03/20/2009,smooth and fast,4,"Purchased mine as a lease turn in with 30,000 miles on it. I now have 45,000 on it and it's just as good now as it was then. Very good car for the driving enthusiast or just as a daily driver. Affordable power and handling in a stylish design that is well put together and balanced. Good fit and finish overall. 127 mph top speed is impressive for a sedan."
pontiac,grand-prix,2007,Tappan01, 04/02/2009,Great Car,4,"This is my ""4th"" Grand Prix - and have loved each one I had.  I can't believe they have stopped production of this model. This car has lots of power for the V6.  Love the road-tight feel to the steering, but the traction control is not good at all.  The car handles well in all weather and gets good gas mileage.  Beautiful looking car and nice wheels on the GT model.  Radio could be of higher quality."
pontiac,grand-prix,2007,Kruzy, 12/31/2007,'07 Grand Prix N/A,4,"3rd Grand Prix after owning an '01 GT, and an '03 GTP. The gtp was ballsier, but the '07 n/a really puts you in the seat just as hard upon acceleration. Body lean doesn't seem bad at all, and body design is nice."
pontiac,grand-prix,2007,SILVER'07 , 05/05/2009,Nice Car that is no longer built.,4,"I had an 02 Volvo S60 prior to this car.  I liked it overall, however it was to the repair point ($2100 was a bit much) so I had to make a decision to keep or trade off.  So I thought about what kind of car I would like to replace it with.  Knowing the reliability of the GM's powerhouse 3.8 a.k.a 3800 v-6, I wanted a car with that particular engine.  The Grand Prix and I think the Buick Lacross was the last of the 3.8.  Well being in my 20's I didn't want the Buick, so I did a search on Cars.com website and found a loaded up Grand Prix.  I tried the G6 and didn't like it, so I bought the GP as it is larger.  It has been good so far.  Love the purr of the 3800! Hope it goes to 200,000 miles! "
pontiac,grand-prix,2007,ldenn, 05/13/2009,Rattles and Rotors,4,"Big fan of the Pontiac Grand Prix 3x owner.  This car has a lot of rattling inside which seems to come from the sunroof, have had it at the dealership 8 times and they still are not able to fix it. The rattling becomes very unerving on long road trips and bumpy roads. The rotors had to be replaced the first year I had it and now have to be replaced again 6 months later.  There is a problem with the rotors obviously. "
pontiac,grand-prix,2007,Movie Buff, 01/18/2008,"All the benefits, none of the expense",5,"We just purchased this Grand Prix, and so far have nothing but positives to say about it. And I'm a die hard Japanese car buyer. But, after speaking with many Grand Prix owners, researching and test driving, we took the step to domestic. We've met many owners with mileage well into the 100,000k, many over 150,000k, on model years '03 forward, with little if no problems. Ride is fantastic, corners like a pro, with little ""roll"". Interior comfort excellent, quite and well mannered on the road. Acceleration is excellent, and we're getting 28 to 30 on these mountain roads of SW Virginia, which by the way, the car does very well in the snow and ice. We kept our ""Subie"" as a second car"
pontiac,grand-prix,2007,question00, 07/12/2009,underrated,4,"the v-8 is fast while still getting great mileage. i average 22 mpg with a good mix of city and hwy driving. as the editors review says, there may be to much torque because of the powerful v-8; however i wouldn't trade down the horsepower.  great car.  good mix of sports car, fuel economy, and luxury vehicle."
pontiac,grand-prix,2007,Brian, 08/18/2009,"Still solid after 49,000 miles",4,"I've driven this car 49,000 miles in two and a half years, and I can't complain.  Still rides and drives like new, and problems thus far have been minimal (warped window moldings, brake rotors and a slight electrical issue, all fixed under warranty).  Easy to maintain, and mechanics have nothing but good things to say about its future.  Good gas mileage (30+ highway), solid ride and comfortable overall.  No regrets."
pontiac,grand-prix,2007,I Miss Pontiac!, 09/09/2009,I Miss Pontiac!,4,"I do like my 2007 Pontiac Grand Prix. I still don't love it. I am a Mercury Cougar fan, I had 2 including a 25th Anniversary Edition. The Pontiac and Grand Prix version is a wonderful car. I have leather, heated seats, dual temp controls, sunroof, remote start, and the XM and 6 CD changer. All in a regular GP, not GT. I was told it was customer built. My car was also a program car. I have not had any problems. Just the normal oil and maintenance routines. The Driver's Info center is fun. The car does have get-up- and go, you can pass easily. "

I'll keep my Pontiac forever, especially because Pontiacs don't going to be built anymore, sadly."
pontiac,grand-prix,2007,kanreich, 07/29/2010,Still going strong,4,"Have 130,000 miles on this car and haven't had to do anything to it.  Runs exactly as it did at 30,000 miles."

I have only had my GXP for a couple of months, and I wouldn't trade it for anything.  We took her on a road trip from Nebraska to California, and we were very impressed with the mileage that we got, even over mountains!  I really like how everything is within easy reach of the driver, even if she is short.  I love this car! Pontiac should have never quit making driving excitement."
pontiac,grand-prix,2007,delta125, 01/14/2011,"Like it, But much rather have a G8.",4,"Got mine in August 2010 with 54,000 miles on it and only paid 11000 for it with everything I could Want. Great car, I treat it terribly but have no problems with it. Averaging 18 mpg mostly a city drive for me, Not a big fan of all the exterior plastic and how the Controls are angled toward me. My by far favorite part of this car is the stiching on the leather, makes the interior shine im my opinion."
pontiac,grand-prix,2007,GrandPrixForever!!!, 08/28/2006,Awesome Car!!!,5,"I love this car!!! This thing has some great power! Not to mention a great stereo, great handling, Great ride, and awesome style. I would highly recommend this car to anyone! I would definely buy another one. :)"
pontiac,grand-prix,2007,kymc, 09/03/2006,The best of both worlds!,4,"I am the proud owner of a 2007 Grand Prix GT in gorgeous crimson red. This car has unbelievable power, a smooth ride and a luxurious interior. Drove a 2000 GT for six years before this one and loved it, but GM has built an awesome vehicle with this new model. Roomy interior for families and good gas mileage make this car an unbeatable buy for the price. I love the crystal clear view out of the front and rear windows....amazing."
pontiac,grand-prix,2007,VVT, 12/19/2006,3rd Grand Prix,4,"I love this car it is my 3rd grand prix. It's got all the features you could want with a strong engine, what more could you ask for?  "
pontiac,grand-prix,2007,Joe, 01/01/2007,Still a Very Good Car,4,"This is a powerful and fun car to drive.  It handles well and goes like Jet Stink when you need it.  Primary complaint is that at Highway speeds, it gets 22.5 - 24.5 maximum, no where near the 28 EPA estimate.  I can usually meet or exceed the highway EPA estimates in all my vehicles, but not this one.  The 3.8 V-6 normally aspirated gets 30 - 34 on the highway, but lacks the power.  Interior is a little tight and design is dated.  I was sorry to see the Bonneville retired, but this is a close substitute.  Runs fine on regular gas.  I expect excellent reliability on the proven 3.8 V-6 and 4 Speed Automatic.  AC works well as usually for GM.  "
pontiac,grand-prix,2007,PontiacGuy, 02/25/2007,Not As good as my 2002 Grand Prix,4,"This is my 2nd Grand Prix. I was hoping for the same overall performance and economy as my 2002 but it didn't happen. The fuel mileage is nowhere near 27, 18 is the highest to date. The transmission is sloppy from 1st to 2nd in traffic, the dealer says its ""hunting"" to save fuel. Then it does find the gear it slams hard. It is very unpredictable. On the plus side the interior is great, car is very power full and fun to drive and it looks great. "
pontiac,grand-prix,2007,Brian, 03/07/2007,"A solid, fun car",4,"An excellent vehicle so far!  The 3.8L V6/4-speed auto combination is among GM's most reliable powertrains and provides more than ample power in everyday driving.  Power delivery is seamless, and merging onto fast-moving freeways is a breeze.  More than enough room for four adults (five in a pinch), and the trunk is large with much usable space.  I drove a 2003 Grand Prix 43,000 in 2 years without a single problem, and this one's shaping up to be even better.  "
pontiac,grand-prix,2007,John, 05/01/2007,Great Car,5,More standard features than the Charger was a huge selling point for me. Anyone complaining about the gas mileage didn't do their homework before they bought. For a large V8 it gets me 19 in mixed driving and as much as 30 on the open road. No issues with torque steer due to the larger front tires. Love the HUD and Monsoon stereo.
pontiac,grand-prix,2007,bryan, 05/31/2007,Best of both worlds,4,I was looking for a vehicle to be a four door and sporty with enough power. The Grand Prix has both of them and great fuel economy for its size. Am a traveling salesman and this vehicle is a perfect fit for my present situation and would recommend it to similar people
pontiac,grand-prix,2007,Klatu, 07/04/2007,I love it!,4,"I have 3 Pontiac Grand Prix sedans, 2000, 2003, both silver, and now the black 2007 GT Special Edition. This one is the best for performance, handling, and comfort (well, they all are good in my opinion).  The car can really go when it is needed; like merging onto the highway to avoid the speeding trucks, or when you need to pass someone quickly.  All of the controls are easy to see and adjust while driving. The Monsoon system has great sound whether using CD's, XM or normal radio. When I first got it there was a harsh sound through the speakers at times from the normal AM radio, but it went away within a few weeks.  This really a fun car to drive; a real classic."
pontiac,grand-prix,2007,TopCop35, 06/22/2007,The most beast for the buck,5,"After my 2003 GTP, there were some big shoes to fill. I do miss the whine of the supercharger lighting up, but the throaty rumble of the exhaust is a nice replacement. The acceleration is smooth and fluent, cornering is a breeze, love the new HUD, and DIC with variable component monitoring. All in all, this car has rocked my socks off and the looks, honks, and thumbs up from other drivers are a sure sign of true appreciation. She's a beautiful beast that looks sophisticated and menacing at the same time with hidden power galore. This definitely isn't your father's sports sedan ;) "

pontiac,grand-prix,2007,Goonboy2, 08/01/2007,What has happened to Pontiac?,3,"I have owned the last three versions of the Grand Prix and each one has become more technologically advanced and stylish than the last while build quality and interior design has become progressively inferior. My 2007 Grand Prix pales in comparison to the interior design and materials in my 2000. Mesh-like headliner and sun visor material scream ""cheap."" The plastic interior pieces are visually and physically ""hard"". The carpet is coarse and the leather doesn't even smell like leather. Heck, I'm a Grand Prix lover and I'm embarassed for GM. It would seem that the Grand Prix has been allowed to suffer the same agonizing death as its Pontiac brothers. Sorry GM, my next car will be Japanese. "
pontiac,grand-prix,2007,GP & TA, 08/19/2007,'07 GP GT,4,"I've had the GT for about 3 months and love it over all. I do not have any regrets about my choice. Rush-hour commuting is now far more tolerable. I'd even say enjoyable, but driving the GT is far better than the stop and go of rush-hour. The driver's seat is very comfortable. The A/C and climate control options are far better than any other car I've owned or driven. Granted, it would be nice if the front passenger seat had the same power options."
pontiac,grand-prix,2007,tony n., 09/21/2007,Truly is driving excitement.,4,This is my third Pontiac. i owned a 1996 Bonneville and a 1999 Grand Prix. By far the 2007 blows them away. With just the base model the performance is awesome and the ride could not be better. You will know in minutes of driving one that you are in a solid and reliable automobile. I could not be happier.
pontiac,grand-prix,2007,Brent, 10/12/2007,Happy First Timer!,4,"This is the first Pontiac my wife and myself have owned. I can honestly say we could not have chosen a better car for the money. The car's comfort is excellent and interior layout is well thought. The car gives a great ride while hugging the road very well. 200hp gets the job done for the cars size and it seems as though more would be scary to drive. The car is well appointed even at base model. Ours has the premium package with heated leather. So nice! So enough said, we'll be buying Pontiac again."
pontiac,grand-prix,2007,Prin, 10/22/2007,New Beginnings,4,"I haven't had my car long, but I have enjoyed every minute of it.  It rides very smooth, has great ""get up"" and just feels wonderful. I am very happy with my purchase."

The gas mileage is only getting around 21 mpg and that is really disappointing since sticker says 20/30 and have bout 50/50 city/hwy miles.  Otherwise it's an awesome car. Very sporty, yet it's a family car.  It's very sharp looking and fun to drive.  Radio will blow you out of the car! Overall, I'm pretty satisfied. "
pontiac,grand-prix,2007,riggermatt, 05/17/2008,Good stuff,4,"I haven't had this vehicle for very long yet, but I am very happy with the car so far. The gas mileage has been great. I'm getting any between 30-33 mpg on the highway. I also only go 65, because its much more efficient than 70+, and only lose a few minutes in travel time."
pontiac,grand-prix,2007,tina_2, 05/29/2008,Kind of worried about this car...,3,"This is my second Grand Prix. I bought a 98 GT new and kept it until 2007 when I purchased this one preowned. Already having some problems with this one though and it has me worried that it will not last until it is paid off. Problems are with brakes & rotors and currently my blower motor is not working, won't know why until it is checked out Saturday. Pretty good gas mileage for the size of the car and enough power to keep me happy."

It's hard to believe that most car mags blasted this car. This car will run with most sports sedans and knock the hell out of the rest. 
If you can find one thats been maintained, oil changes and the like, BUY IT.
I'm 6' 3"""" tall and 230 lbs and the leather seats are still in great shape.

pontiac,grand-prix,2008,Tom rauch, 12/30/2015,Pontiac shouldn't have left us,4,"After owning the car for about a year, I have gone through all 4 seasons. Spring, good. Summer, alright with the exception of the tranny running hot. Fall, good. Winte... now getting 2 feet of snow in a week, icy roads and a v8. I was nervous, but with stability control, abs, and traction control I found myself more relaxed through the winter then I thought I would be. This car has truly surprised me with it winter capabilities. I snowboard and so I need room for my gear, and also need to get up the mountain. This car has proved itself worthy. 

Now fuel economy for me is about 22 mpg, I drive 60 miles a day just for work and plus all of my running around is in this car. For a v8 and me having a heavy foot sometimes, I can't complain. Which brings me to my next point. This car is quiet, but if you open her up she has a growl that is just beautiful. Not to much and not to little.

The interior is... Well the hud is nice, I love the seats, butt warmers, dual auto climate control, and dic. However the plastics rattle Alot. It is in my opinion the biggest down side to the car.

I am aproaching 120k miles, and do regular maintenance, along with preventative maintenance, and have had no major issues yet.

The value had gone down to much,  so if you wanted one now is the time for 4 or 5 grand.

I am happy with this car so far after putting almost 50k miles on it and hope it keeps me that way.

I have owned this car for about two years and have only one bad thing to say about the car but other than that the car has been a great fit for me. I have owned the car for about five years. It has great gas mileage, great horsepower, it has needed only minimal repairs, and the only thing bad thing about it has been an issue with the ignition but that has been fixed. This is my first Pontiac I have bought and I donÂt regret the decision one bit. Every day I have to commute about 20 miles to work, so most of the miles I have put on my car are highway miles.
My Pontiac gets around 30 miles per gallon on the highway."
pontiac,grand-prix,2008,69Judge, 09/13/2009,Last year 2008 GP GXP goes out Winner!,4,"These GP GXP's are a terrific value right now. Very stylish inside and out. It is a blast to drive the V8 is strong and produces a great exhaust tone on the road, it handles the road with ease all instrumentation is easy to read and driver friendly. Everyone loves te suede leather bucket seats they are really comfortable. I have plenty of head/leg room. The 18 inch rims really make the car stand out in the parking lot. The GXP makes driving fun again, sporty with V8 power to match and all the extra options you'd expect from a luxury car. The 05-08 GXP's(14,800) are one of the automotive industry's best kept secrets!! I'm very, very happy with mine."
pontiac,grand-prix,2008,Great Car, 04/11/2010,Great Car!,4,"This is a great car! I get about 24 miles per gallon average, which isn't fantastic, but isn't that bad, either. I love all of the features, like remote access, CD player, cruise control and especially the on-board computer system with trip meters, tire monitor and oil monitor. I feel very safe in this car! The other day I had run over a nail and didn't even know it until my computer system warned me that my front passenger tire was low! I love the sporty style, so unique from other cars out there. This is no boring Toyota! Great power, better than my 1996 Subaru. Only bad thing is the poor quality materials in the interior.  Interior is set up nicely, though.  Massive trunk space!"
pontiac,grand-prix,2008,Realworld, 04/19/2008,BMW Killer?,2,"As far as this thing compared to a European sedan, that's like comparing a Jackhammer to a golf club. It does go - but, pretty much where ever the surplus of traction happens to be - hang on tight! or you might kiss the guard rail.  Amenities are good but overkill - ""Stealth Mode"" is a bit sophomoric, as are the useless fixed tap shifters in a dated 4 speed slush box. (they work fine as a two speed stoplight racer). Brakes are more aesthetic than athletic - and where is the Spare tire? a can of goo? Interior quality typical GM with loose door panels(one fell off in parking lot after opening drivers door!), cheap plastic buttons and drooping headliner. Not too reassuring in a new car"

First impression:  throaty growl stimulates adrenal gland...then ride on the street is like drinking sour milk.  Suspension is so soft that the front emd bottoms out at speed over moderate undulations in the road.  Feels like floating in a raft in the pool.  Torque steer nearly planted me in the car in the next lane on the freeway.  Under hard acceleration, it is not unlike flying a helicopter: don't even think of releasing the controls! Constant input requirement drowns the fun of the acceleration."
pontiac,grand-prix,2008,Dave, 06/30/2008,Perfect Blend,4,"After reading the Edmunds Editor review I have to conclude that he or she did not even drive the car.  First of all the GXP V8 weighs less than the old 3.8 supercharged GTP and I have seen 0 - 60 in less than 6 seconds.  This car is a great blend of performance, fun, comfort and if driven correctly on the highway can get super mileage.  I have been averaging 29 mpg on the highway and can still punch it out from a red light and leave a nice cloud of smoke in the rear view mirror.  True to the G8 is a great performance car, but try driving it in the snow.  At least the GXP gives you the V8 push and still offers descent year round driving capabilities. Next time have your editor drive one."
pontiac,grand-prix,2008,VROOOOOM!, 05/13/2008,Great Car!,5,"What an awesome car!  I am a little sad that this will be the last Grand Prix model year, and that 2 doors are not an option anymore.  But otherwise, I have owned 4 Pontiacs, 2nd Grand Prix (other was a 01 GT) and I expect the same level of satisfaction as with all the others.  Gas mileage is NOT BAD for a V8, especially with the active fuel management system.  When you spend as much time in a car as I do commuting, you must LOVE your car! Traded a Mazda CX7. The CX7 was awful on gas (with a 4 cyl), very hard to see out of, and felt cheap!  I did not feel the joy of ""zoom zoom.""  I definitely like the VROOM VROOM more!  "
pontiac,grand-prix,2008,GMMan, 10/12/2010,GM Cheated Us,2,"WE bought a used pontiac grand prix se from Iron Trail Motors in Virginia Mn with 26,000 miles on it. The day after we got it the car started to have problems. The dealer fixed a few thing but not the major issues like the paint falling off. that's right the car now has 49,972 miles and the paint is falling off. i called GM and took it to get looked at, they told us it was in an accident and repainted and now delamination has began.GM said they cant help us but there is no proof of any accident on the title. They said there's nothing they can do. So in all don't go to a Gm dealer or you might get a car thats been smashed then GM says ""sorry we cant help you""and so did the dealership that did it."
pontiac,grand-prix,2008,neveragain, 12/22/2009,I'm done,2,"Well, I love the interior and the sound of a V8 and thats the extent of my love affair with this car.  I have been towed to the dealership twice. Steering issues at the shop three times. Two additional home steering repairs. Serpentine belt tensioner rod broke towed again!  Multiple broken rims and blown tires low profile and Michigan bad combo.  Average MPG 21. Not great, since I drive 90 miles round trip to work daily, of which about 70 is hwy. I am actually paranoid when driving it now waiting for the next break down. I owe $11g on this beautiful heap and gotta get rid of it! Thanks Motor City!"
pontiac,grand-prix,2008,skitterbug, 02/15/2010,New to me,3,"My 08 grand prix is 2 yrs old w/ 60k miles.  I've only had it 2 days but so far it seems like a good car.  The interior could use some work, I'm 5'7 and I feel like i'm going to hit my head on the roof w/ the seat completely lowered.  On the other hand my 2 children cann't see out the windows in the back because the seats are too low.  My son is 4'3, 5 yrs old and in a booster, the window placement is way too high.  Plus I'm use to driving SUV's and I don't like how low the car sits I feel like I have to pull myself up out of the car.  Time will tell I love pontiac and this is my second one.  My sunfire lasted 7 years w/ tons of driving and little maintence hope this one holds up as well."
pontiac,grand-prix,2008,driverEd!, 09/20/2010,Runs and Drives but not much more.,3,"Purchased this with 30K on it and was excited for the 100K warranty.  Too bad it does not cover anything that went wrong with this car.  Fun to drive, exterior looks somewhat dated, but cool, interior is junk.  Shift linkage jammed up and could not put car in drive, had to be towed. Heater vent fell out and split in half.  Window seals on driver door leaks water, drips on window switches.  Glove box handle broke and fell off, $165 for that part.  Trunk seal leaks water, trunk gets moldy smell.  Once and a while the engine won't start without cranking for over 1 FULL minute. Just another Union made piece of junk. It's for sale as of today!"
pontiac,grand-prix,2008,sbronemann, 06/20/2013,Very cheap interior and build quality,3,"I bought this car in May of 2012 with 28,500 miles on it.
Currently has 62k on it and things are starting to go bad.
Headlights turn off occassionally on their own, valve cover gasket is leaking, sunroof leaks, and ignition switch is going bad.
It is fun to drive and does get pretty good gas mileage, recent trip to South Carolina resulted in 31.3 MPG cruising right at 71 mpg GPS verified.
The torque steer is absolutely horrible as you could expect with a front drive V8 with 303 HP.
Looking to get rid of it very soon."
pontiac,grand-prix,2008,Dave, 09/02/2018,Never buy something just because it looks nice,1,"The only good thing I can say about this car is the profile. My dad bought it brand new in 07 ran good up till 2011. I'm constantly taking that car to the shop. It's never a simple $50 to $100 fix its always $500 for this $800 for that $1000 for this. It not like I hot rod in it. I baby the f✴✴k out of that car.

pontiac,grand-prix,2008,Russell Lewis, 11/06/2007,I'm trying to find the positives,1,"Let me start by saying, I've only had this car a few days but wow...  It is awful.  No light in the trunk.  Front doors don't unlock when you open the door twice.  The odomoter is in a stupid place.  The radio has FM text, good luck reading it.  The A pillars are in AWFUL locations, visibility out of the car is dangerously deminished.  I think Pontiac hired Pablo Picasso to do the interior ergonomics.  I'm sure someone calls it beautiful, but it doesn't fit any human.  The steering wheel is just awkward, has too much slop/play and feels cheap.  The seats are also rather bad.  As for how the car drives.. Awful.  The car I have doesn't have anti-locks!"
pontiac,grand-prix,2008,mondo, 06/12/2008,Grand prix 2008 6-banger,4,"This car is very fun, I think people driving next to you don't expect this car to perform as it does (it is a sedan).  I've owned many nice cars and todays economy has forced me to buy under 20,000.  For the money this car is perfect for average sized people, small families can benefit greatly.  I can't believe the gas mileage!  It rides like a silent hotrod if you will, but cost very minimal to operate.  Say what you want about the fancy technology inside, get extended warranty.  The power train warranty is piece of mind enough.  Would recommend this car to anybody!  "
pontiac,grand-prix,2008,RICKTART, 06/04/2008,Very nice car,4,I bought this car and drove from New Jersey to Florida and back very nice ride for long distance the front seats felt kinda hard and uncomfortable but the handling and the speed makes up for it a lot of power for a 6 cyl. For the size of the car spins tires with ease great high speed handling would recommend to anybody
pontiac,grand-prix,2008,ricktart, 06/03/2008,very nice car,4,This car is very nice the day after I bought the car I drove it from New Jersey to Florida and it drove great the whole way good power also not a whole lot but its got a lot of pep and will spin tires extremely easy had some problems with the molding under the windshield wipers but the dealer is taking care of that its got a semi sporty interior but a lot of plastic 
pontiac,grand-prix,2008,photoguy, 07/09/2008,"A ""FAN"" for GrandPrix...",4,"3 weeks & 1500 miles of ownership so far & totally satisfied! Looks great on the outside & inside (ivory White) (camel interior)! Nice ""stock"" sound system & very nice ergonomic & (comfort) features makes this car fun to drive, pleasure to own, can't wait to drive it every day ! Refined powertrain is peppy too! Handling & other features are better than consumer reports ""says"" they are, (. By the way !). One has to drive this automobile to appreciate it (thank you gm!)"
pontiac,grand-prix,2008,Toyota Boy, 07/26/2008,Surprisingly fun,4,"I rented this car for a week on Maui and was pleasantly surprised.  I've always liked the looks of the Grand Prix, and after sitting behind the wheel I really began to dig it.  It took a little getting used to the layout of the cabin but once I did, I found myself loving the feel of the car. Smooth power, great in the twisties (driving up& down the switchbacks to the Haleakala crater at 10,000 ft). The interior feels a little cheap but I'd only place it a little below the '08 Camry. Overall, I'd say this is a fun car for a good price and definitely worth a look if you're in the market for a sedan."
pontiac,grand-prix,2008,shawnmichaels123, 08/15/2008,My 2nd Pontiac Grand Prix,5,"I am a long time Pontiac fan.  While considering the new G8, I also researched other cars that Pontiac had to offer. Once I found out about all the standard equipment that the 2008 Grand Prix, I never looked back.  It has everything you need at a MSRP of $22,210.  Right now is a great time to consider this automobile. When I purchased my new Grand Prix on 8-8- 2008, Pontiac offered a great cash rebate or fair financing. Also, this is the last year of the Grand Prix.  Dealerships will definitely work with you on your final purchase price. Thank you"
pontiac,grand-prix,2008,Frank, 09/04/2008,Practical and Pretty,4,"Affordable sedan that looks great, front wheel drive for Colorado snow and sporty feel and drive. Reliable and refined W platform means nice ride and long life power train (3800 Gen III) V6 engine. Power is adequate."

pontiac,grand-prix,2008,Kosty, 10/10/2008,At Used Pricing Its a Fantastic Value,5,"My purchase was a rental fleet vehicle with sunroof and leather heated seats XM Radio. Well below MSRP, great value.  After driving, my impressions have only improved.  Vehicle was impressive for the price.  Ergonomics for driver and front seat passenger are great.  Headroom with sunroof for passenger is only issue for tall passengers.  Fold flat front seat and rear seats give almost incredible transport capacity. its almost like a small SUV for cargo.  Driver info display , radio and climate controls as well as steering wheel controls are well thought out.  Lumbar support, seat adjustments and heated seats make vehicle comfortable for long distance driving.  Buy used for real value."
pontiac,grand-prix,2008,LS, 11/08/2008,Excellent buy,4,"The Grand Prix has always been one of the cars that I've liked, so i decided to give it a look wheni was in the market even though this was its last year. The drive is assurred, and fun, with ample power. i like the aggressive styling, and the quiet cabin. the interior is a tad bland, but everything else makes up for it. the drivers seat is nice and comfortable, and envelopes you in the seat. it feels like it has more than the 200 HP that it's rated at as its quick out the gate, and its mice to have the power when needed. Good MPG, in my first 1K I avg 23MPG in the city, which is excellent for a V6. bottom line, is that I think that  I've made the best decision, as this was a great value."
pontiac,grand-prix,2008,Cheryl, 11/17/2008,Gotta Love it!,4,"I just purchased my 2008 Grand Prix Sedan & I am just loving it! I had a Chrysler Sebring, then a Chevrolet HHR & my favorite is the Grand Prix! Just wish it was summer so I could ride the highway! But I just enjoy driving it back & forth to work. It's comfortable, classy, and has get up & go when you want it to. Plenty of space too. Love the display that lets me know if the tire pressure is low and also the option to have OnStar makes me feel a little better driving in the snow in Michigan. I feel secure. A must drive, must buy and enjoy! "
pontiac,grand-prix,2008,stelo27, 12/03/2008,An Honest Review,4,"I had a 2006 Grand Prix GT V6 Supercharged and fell in love with it. I have always been a big Mazda fan growing up but had to switch to Pontiac after trading in my Mazda 6S for the 06 Grand Prix GT. I had it for 8 months and then sadly wrecked it. So i turned around and jumped right back into a 2008 Grand Prix, but the GXP this time. I love it. There is room for improvement, which i believe they have accomplished it in the new G8, But people, this is an awsome car. Especially for the price. I got mine slightly used with 9k miles on it, it MSRP for $29800, but being that its the last year for the Grand Prix and with the G8 now available, I got my GP GXP for $19000 and you can't beat that."

I would say, its made to fit you!! Not to mention, in these economic times, we get about 19/24mpg yet it's cheaper then the camry and the malibu! "
pontiac,grand-prix,2008,peter christoff, 02/14/2009,Last of the Grand Prixs,4,"I think it was a big mistake for GM to do away with the Grand Prix. I love mine. I test drove a new G8, and was not impressed at all. The 2008 Grand Prix got a bad rap when they underrated it as just another carry over car that was ready to be put out to pasture,so to speak. I will drive this one with pride, and hope GM brings it back in a few years like the Camaro. "

I get excited every time I drive and love the car it's the newest car Ive ever owned, and more power then Im used to but Im trying to conserve. it's roomy for everyone. The car does have get up and go, havent gone on highway for long distance. I too like cockpit feel and how everything centers around me driving and easy access to info. I would like less plastic and stronger feel buttons I want this car to last and look good the whole time. I also hope they might bring back and improve gas or turn to cng car or hydrogen car for zero emission! and I'd get that I got this cause owned two pontia"

The car right of the bat sold itself as far as performance and comfort went. I fell in love with the rumble of the exhaust..And punch the pedal and you can feel the pull. As for torque steer, we are talking about an big torgue high hp V-8 in a car...Not some little handa with 200 hp and no real torque, so of course you will have this at times. Just hold on and make sure you are aimed in a direction other than whats desired! Torque steer can also be found in any Cadillac fwd with the northstar!"
pontiac,grand-prix,2008,tsfergus, 05/21/2009,Lots of Problems - ready for a new car,3,"Was fun to drive in the summer, but living in Michigan - it is single- handedly the worst vehicle I have ever driven on snow and ice.  It was so bad that it could no longer be used on the freeway during the winter.  Also, for over a year now, there is a constant squeaking noise coming from the front tire.  Three times to the dealership, new brakes and they still can't find out what's wrong.  Have also had a electronic system failure warning pop up on the dash display twice.  Not very comforting when you drive on the freeway everyday.  Overall, too many problem for a new car."

It has remote start (great for winter for heat or summer for A/C) built-in antenna, painted alloy wheels, full power seats, windows, doors, etc. Body on outside is great.  The interior is overall good besides a little rattle of the smallest, imobile vent in the dash that is intermittent. Everyone loves my car but I've seen the same frame on the reliable, world famous 2002 Impala. That is not a bad thing at all, the interior is way different!  I can't be more annoyed by prissy-foot drivers saying, ""too much torque!"" IT IS A PONTIAC!! THEY MAKE ALL CARS FASTER!! My Pontiac NEVER got stuck in the 2009 winter storm of Seattle!! 8"" anywhere!!  "

Well I get about that city but, highway I get usually 33mpg going 55mgh - gets 27 mpg going 65 mph (as long as I stay out of it). Brakes are amazing, handling is also amazing for a 4 door family car that weights 4,600lbs.  My main complaint is the quality of the materials. I take very good care of my car and baby it! The leather on the seats is starting to wear more then my 5 year old Cadillac I had prior, the paint job stinks, it's starting to chip and wear in places it shouldn't for a 2 year old car and the interior is all plastic??  Shouldn't this problem with a $30,000 car."

Had a 98 Grand Am with over 250,000 on it when I sold it and it was still running a of 2 years ago (lost track of it). I love the power when you step on the accelerator you can feel the g's pulling you back in your seat.S for winter driving I had no problems in the 2009 winter here in the North Idaho. Put 4 studded tires on and went everywhere in 12"" of snow and ice. The exterior could use a little more chrome here and there.  "

Issues with not starting, rack and pinion leak, and trans slipping with 34000 miles. I also found out it was a Hertz rental. So it definitely has been beat on. mileage is not good, city is 14.5 no highway trips yet but definitely a thirsty engine."
pontiac,grand-prix,2008,STEVE HECKMAN, 01/31/2010,Great style at low price,4,"I was a car critic at a very early age and continue to be years after graduating from GMI [General Motors Institute]. The last Grand Prix is very distinctive which is a real plus compared to generic ""non-style"" from Toyota and other mass marketers.  The GP also has a strong V6 that delivers excellent fuel economy without being a slug like many of it's competitors.  Mine has a tan interior which remains cool even on the hottest summer days with the sunroof wide open. On winter days the heated seats react quickly and also serve to relieve muscle strain from shoveling snow. The seats are very comfortable even after a 500 mile drive.  After 46k miles I have no complaints, only praise."

This is my 3rd one and my 2008 Grand Prix is my favorite car of all time. I got it with 13k mile on it, have 89k on it now. No problems. Lots of horsepower, love the heated leather seats, the tire pressure system has come in handy. Slight hum from the climate control motor (drives my wife nuts, doesn't bother me). Started getting better gas mileage the more I drove it. I thought about trading it in on a 2014 Mustang but I would miss this car too much. I'm keeping it for now.

pontiac,grand-prix,2008,Carl, 04/20/2010,My 3rd 3800 series engine,4,"I've owned an '86 Park Ave and a '92 Olds 88 prior to buying this car--both with 3800 engines.  The 3800 is solid.  My car has 31,000 mi. I look forward to keeping this car for the next 15 years.  I bought the car used a year ago and have put 6,000 mi. on it. There's only 2 problems:  the keyless remote needs new batteries and the rear seats could use a little more leg room.  However, on the pro side, the car handles great in the city and on the highway.  Plenty of power in any situation. I'm 6 ft. tall and feel fine in the driver's seat. Some folks grip about the interior finish--I think it's fine.  Overall, I still love the car after a year and would recommend it."
pontiac,grand-prix,2008,2008 Pontiac, 05/04/2010,Okay Car,3,"This is my 4th Pontiac and I do like Pontiac's, but this car has been in the shop for warranty work 3x already, and for other repairs about 2x. That's a lot for 2 years if you ask me. My last Pontiac went 4 years before I had to repair anything. I am a little disappointed and depending on how many more problems I have, will depend on whether I keep this car or not. If this is all Pontiac has left, then it was time to retire. I have had power steering problems, constant issues with the brakes, wheel bearings have already been replaced and the car has under 50,000 miles. I guess they don't make them like they used to."
pontiac,grand-prix,2008,pontiac owner jim, 06/13/2010,Honest Review of the Grand Prix GXP,3,"I'm a young professional and I need a car to take clients out. I test drove a gently used maxima, a tsx,and an IS 250. Liked them all. I test drove the GP GXP and was pleasantly surprised. The V8 power,options,and handling of this car far outperformed the others above. And it was ~ $8,000 less.  The car is not perfect. Fuel economy is not good and there are some cheap materials on the interior. There is torque steer due to front wheel drive but its not intolerable. But the performance and options you get for the value far outweighs the negatives. "
pontiac,grand-prix,2008,Preston&Jonathon , 08/23/2010,Good Car,5,"We bought this Grand Prix roughly a month ago.  We love it!  Before this we had a Grand Am GT which was great, and help in purchasing another Pontiac. The grand Prix, is much more refined and much smoother looking and running. Although for it's size and weight the base 3.8 can feel a little bit weak at times. And fuel economy leaves room to be desired."
pontiac,grand-prix,2008,Betawolf, 09/12/2010,"Great car, no wonder it got stolen!",4,"Hey i bought my 08 grand prix this about a month ago, it got stolen last week. Very good looking car and has great power and acceleration. The fuel economy is a little on the down side thanks to the fuel thirsty V6. Interior looks modern and nice, with comfortable seats and a user-friendly cock-pit. The exterior is very stylish and sporty, with tinted windows, a spoiler, and sleek curves. I had no complaints with anything except my 2008 model had no anti-theft devices or onstar which in the end is why i do not have the car anymore!"

pontiac,grand-prix,2008,SG, 02/05/2008,GXP,4,I traded in my 04 Grand Prix GTP to upgrade to a 08 GXP and I must say that what a difference it makes having a V8 engine. It rumbles and has much more power than the GTP. It handles better with the front tires being wider than the rear. I'm a Grand Prix fan and always will be.
pontiac,grand-prix,2008,blakehannan, 12/14/2010,Great Car Overall,4,"I bought this car last February used. It is very fast, rides tight... Hard suspension so its a little bumpy but ill survive due to the performance. I love the look of the exterior with the factory wheels, id love to put some different wheels on to make it look even more sharp! But, the downfall to this vehicle is the interior, the seats are nice, but the plastic throughout the car is a little annoying and i do not believe that Pontiac put any time into it and did not give the consumer what they should have gotten. Could have been an AMAZING vehicle, but due to this, just great. Good fuel economy for 5.3 L V-8."

Excellent car, but burned through brakes like crazy. After replacing front brakes with rotors at about 18k, needed all brakes/rotors again at 25k. Some light arm twisting at the local dealer and GM rep agreed to a whole new set of rotors/pads front and back. Still holding at 37k though there's a lot of brake dust on the front wheels. Smoking, fast car. Even better than the 2000 Grand Prix GTP turbo I drove for 8 years prior. Too bad, it's the end of an era. "
pontiac,grand-prix,2008,jordanface, 09/05/2011,I'm in love,4,"I don't know much about cars, and from what I hear, Pontiac isn't the greatest kind of car....but I must say that I've grown to fall in love with my car. I bought it in 2009 when it had 30,000+ miles on it. Since then, I've put about 20,000+ miles on it and I've had absolutely no issues with my car. My only issue is that the front end bumper is so low, it end up scraping when I park. I've also got a minor leak in my oil pan, but that's nothing major. All in all, she's gotten me to numerous states and back with no issues. It's more of a ""small person"" car, but I don't have issues driving it."
pontiac,grand-prix,2008,Beytmeta, 09/18/2007,An Affordable 5 Series Beamer,4,"The GXP is a serious American sports sedan that is a true competitor with the high priced over designed and excessively engineered German products particularly BMW 5 series.  The 08 GXP performance handling, acceleration and braking is sweet and enjoyable without being too riggid or over the top. On road bumps the 08 GXP is a little untamed; instead of a smart, crisp ""dip the 08 GXP sort of rolls over 'certain' road bumps. This is not a problem persay. The tires are my only concern. 2 different sizes and no tire rotation and no spare is a real challenge.  08 GXP Smart, sweet, gorgious."
pontiac,grand-prix,2008,Amdetsion, 09/18/2007,Almost Perfect,4,"After driving (2) GTP's and a Comp G my experience with the GXP is simply amazing. The GXP is truely a culmination. The Grand Prix is truly expressed through the performance and styling of this car the 08 GXP. If it had anymore technology or performance improvements it would exceed the already excessively designed and engineered German products. The car is precise and smartly cued with technology, comforts and prestige without the lavish and 'non-sensical' over statements and cost common to many up level Euro-imps. I want to ride American and feel good about it. GXP is a very good feeling; especially when I remind myself of its price, operating and maintenance cost.  "

The rumble from the exhaust is much greater and once you step on the gas you go. The tires are summer tires though which is a concern living in Chicago. Overall it's a blast to drive.

Barely touches the gas to move, can lay down a strips with smoke no problem, outruns a lot of vehicles both older and newer, hits top speed no problem without governor, tons of cabin/cargo space, comfy bucket seats, wish it came with a supercharger. GM should revive the Grand Prix, same engine with a super charger(Make the V6 308HP at least instead of 208HP, AWD, Dual calibers, independent suspension and she'd be a modest monster. Give her some modern touches like LED lights or Halos, hand-stitched leather steering wheel, BOSE sound system with build in amp, bump the top speed a bit and increase the governed speed to 200km at least, a more premium exhaust system. I would buy that car hands down because I know it would be reliable and top a lot of modern vehicles, even if they made it a crossover or SUV would be neat as well -- call it the Grand Prix XS or Grand Prix S. Only issue was with airbags and I've seen these cars with over 350,000km and no issues.

Secondly pull the driver side engine cover replace the fuel line with a steal braided one or else fire will probably occur besides those 2 issues 138xxx miles and she's still running strong with a stage 2 clutch header back exhaust stage 2 brakes and poly eurothane bushings gets ride of the body roll for most of your handling problems.

Wonderful power and sounds mean when you put the pedal down. But, it also has the ability to be quite when leaving the neighborhood at 6 am. This is not a car for the Eco conscious or one looking for the cheapest route from point A to B. This is a car where you will enjoy the commute. Right now, I am measuring the car in smiles per gallon, and believe me, that number is quite large.

In this short time, I've come to the solemn reality that this is the best car I'll ever own! Everything about the way the car drives, handles, accelerates, brakes, was designed to perfection. Everyday I make a boring drive to a boring job, but I'm smiling ear-to-ear both to and from! My GTO is black, with black windows and black rims- very sleek. Anytime I'm just cruising around, I constantly see people turning their heads to watch me drive by and listen to the wonderful low rumble. I haven't pinpointed it yet- but there is just something about this car that is just menacing."

I have replaced the box air filter with a K & N cold air intake. Removed the stock exhaust and replaced it with a Corsa exhaust and replaced the stock headers with a set of Edelbrock and love it. Are there cars out there faster? Sure, but there are not to many and a lot of those have some form of power adder. If you purchase one be prepared to have Mustangs, Charger's, and Challengers want to see what you got. You can show them or do what I do, let 'em go, because they are not even worth the gas."

The lackluster styling of the car is a real fooler. Once I took it out for a drive, I was hooked! I owned a 1964 GTO, 4 barrel with auto transmission in 1968 & 1969 with fond memories, but WOW what a difference. all I can say is if you don't drive a new GTO you have no idea what you are missing. The plain Jane styling is somewhat of a blessing since the cops don't seem to notice the car at all, so far so good, no tickets yet! I did have it up to 135 MPH & there was alot left to go, but that was fast enough for me."

Front seat motors are very slow so backseat entry is a pain. Trunk is small but don't really use it anyway.  Front seats are excellent. "

Since then it has been mostly BMWs, VW's, Porsche's etc.. GM made an offer though their GM credit card that I couldn't refuse, so I bought a 2004 GTO, 6-speed. This truely is a modern muscle car, but with no rattles and NO PROBLEMS! The car is quiet, but with just the right rumble of exhaust. It gets up and goes when you want, and excels on the open road with 22-24 mpg at 80 mph. Don't let the looks fool you, this car is better in every way than the 1964 tri-power GTO that I drove back in the good old days."

Yes, I remember driving the original GTO's, and my 2004 is as fast or faster than the best of the 60's. The difference is that it handles better than most sports cars and is quiet and relaxed on the highway. I've owned mostly BMW's, Porsches and other euro cars, and the build quality of this built down under GTO is as good as any of them. With a 160 mph top end, 14 seconds flat in the quarter, and real world economy of 18 to 24 mpg this is a great car."

Since the car was only built in high-performance versions, there are no ""Barbie-Doll"" GTO's out there like the Mustang. If you see a GTO, you know it's hot. You don't have to check for a medallion or emblem on the fender. And the ""plain"" appearance makes it less likely that anyone will be able to identify the car as they watch your taillights disappear over the horizon. :)  "

Those who ""get it"" almost feel like they're in a club - there's that occasional eye contact from other GTO drivers that says ""there's someone else who understands"".   The GTO is all about ""stealth"" - especially the 2004.   Looks like any other car on the road (especially to police) while more capable than anything even remotely close to its price.  I've wanted this car for 20+ years - I'm glad GM had the guts to build it.   This is a BMW ""6 series"" for the masses."

After I got rid of my Ford Ranger 4x4 (daily driver) this became my daily. Whenever I would accelerate and bring the car to about 4300 rpm, all electronics would cut off and the headlights would get brighter, sometimes causing the bulbs to blow. Had an airbag light go on for no reason and it seemed to fix itself. Rode like crap, handling was mediocre, and build quality was less than spectacular. But it sure sounded good. I blew mustangs away all the time. It can also lay down rubber like nobody's business too. And fuel milage was surprisingly good. Almost 30 MPG hwy."

pontiac,gto,2004,Hapnyny, 02/16/2009,Driver response,4,The GTO is actually a hybrid in the sports car industry. The characteristics of American Muscle! The truth be told the European design becomes questionable with American tag on it. The GTO is much like Audi S4 or a BMW M3 as apposed to the Mustang and Corvettes. I further would like to add that I have had the privilege of running all the cars mentioned.  For those who look for a performance daily driver this is a good reliable automobile. If you want to step it up a notch and have the coin. This car can produce 550hp to the rear wheels and handles it quite nicely with the traction control. In a nut shell this is a euro handling vehicle with American muscle. It is the best of both worlds.
pontiac,gto,2004,Mel Ifudu, 02/19/2009,Why Drive Anything Else?,4,"To put it simply, why drive anything else? That's the thought that goes through my mind when I drive. My GTO is fantastic. It is clearly the best car I have ever driven. Its scary fast (top speed and acceleration) and the exhaust noise, to die for. Thanks to our Aussie friends. Good work, great car. Although there is one thing that upsets me about my car; its the braking performance at high speed. It's like the pads are terrified of the wheel hub. Perhaps I need Brembos.

But as a daily driver, it drinks gas and SHOULD burn premium if you want the performance when you need it.  350 LS1 can easily achieve over 400 horses with minor mods. Nice low naturally rumble. You will need all new suspension by 15k miles - maybe earlier. Read up on it. Handles well for a legendary straight liner but it's heavy. Tires at come with are 245s with bland 17"" wheels.  This car has a dorky design that you get used to. Some people justify it as ""stealth"" or euro. Live with it. They don't make em anymore although I hear they will be reincarnated as a 2011 Caprice."

pontiac,gto,2004,Jim Pesta, 12/02/2004,Fantastic Goat,4,"My 2004 GTO is by far the most refined, comfortable and fun to drive vehicle I have ever owned. It easily surpasses the performance of both the '96 Mustang GT and '98 Camaro Z28 I have owned previously. I do not miss the scary feeling of the rear ends of these cars trying to ""kick out"" every time a slight road imperfection would be encountered when cornering. The GTO's  independent rear suspension (which, along with its motor, it shares with the 2004 Corvette) is a huge improvement over the live axle setup of many other muscle cars, including the '05 Mustang. While the new Mustang may have more flavor in the styling department due to its retro look, I have really come to appreciate the GTO."

The only bad thing is the gas mileage. You can't tweek it like the old Muscle cars. Saw the new 2005's and the scoops are great, but are they true ram? Reliability of the GTO is great. Only two prob's to speak of. Seats started to make a ratchet noise after 2 months. (No fix yet per Pontiac), and on steering volume controls go up instead of down once in a while. (Can't determine prob). Car is stylish, mean and growls nicely. A head turner of today. The six stick and engine vet pack is perfect! Gotta get one for my mom. (She's a motor head too!)"

Rebates have dropped the price but I have no regrets.  Everyone that sees the car compliments me on it.  People have driven up to me to tell me how much they like the car and called out to me, beautiful car, while I was getting gas.  The power is great.  This takes me back to the feeling of the old muscle cars.  Interior is well done.  Once you get into the back seats they are as comfortable as the front.  GM really did a great job on this car.

I couldn't afford the Cadillac but with incentives and deals the GTO gives me 95% of the performance for 50% of the price.

from HOLDEN MONARO to PONTIAC GTO this 
machine kicks butt !"
pontiac,gto,2004,ToddVR, 12/02/2004,Hmm...,4,"Great car! Fast as ever, which has 
landed me 2 speeding tickets within 3 
months of owning. Gas sucks, more so, 
premium is the recommended fuel. I do 
however mix fueling with a lesser grade 
at times, with no significant problems 
noted. Compliments are received almost 
daily; more so from the younger 
generation. Overall, I LOVE MY GTO! "
pontiac,gto,2004,Blueberry, 12/01/2004,Grrrreat Goat!,4,"Bland styling?  No way!  I get
compliments all the time on how this car
looks.  Even I thought it looked
somewhat bland before purchasing.  It
looks better and better as the weeks go
by.  But the performance is what I
wanted and I got that in spades.

What else you can you buy that
comfortably seats four, has a fabulous
interior, runs like a scalded cat &
costs only $27,000? Nothing. The six
speed is smooth and with the amazing
torque I usually just go 1st/3rd/5th
around town. The exhaust note is very
cool, exactly right. On the highway it's
quiet and tracks very well.  I'm not a
boy racer anymore at 53 but I love a hot
car that's comfortable.  GTO is a grand
touring car with lots of bite."
pontiac,gto,2004,Les, 12/07/2004,Pontiac GTO excitement,5,"This car is a blast to drive; it is 
very fast, handles great, brakes are 
excellent and its comfortable, with 
plush bucket seats that support, 
interior finish thats well appointed. 
The value for the buck is terrific!!!
I'm very pleased with the GTO."
pontiac,gto,2004,Lera, 12/08/2004,The Great One,4,"GM service was friendly and helpful, 
not pushy or annoying.  This was the 
third GM dealer I've worked with and 
they all have a consistency for low 
key sales push which is wonderful for 
a consumer.  The vehicle purchased was 
manual yellow jacket with antracite 
interior and I couldn't be happier.  
It is a 2004 model and yet has all the 
power one could ask for.The vehicle 
has one of the smoothest rides you'll 
encounter. Corners amazingly.  Stereo 
is loud and clear, picks up reception 
well even in difficult spots.True dual 
exhaust sounds wonderful; there is 
always a nice humm while crusing 
without stops.  Idle sound purrs.  
Windows tinted perfectly.Leather 
quality fantastic. Clear coat superior."
pontiac,gto,2004,SR Peterson, 12/15/2004,Great vehicle to drive - quite zippy,4,"This vehicle is fun to drive.  
Although getting into the rear seat 
with is difficult, once there, the 
seat in back rivals the bucket seats 
in the front.  This car sounds and 
responds wonderfully.  The dash has a 
neat feature in the color of the dash 
in the daylight is different to the 
color at night (it turns black when 
the lights are on due to placement).  
The car seems to be very reliable.  "
pontiac,gto,2004,tony, 12/24/2004,back to my youth,4,"just purchased the vehicle. one word to 
expain it, awesome. first timr behind 
the wheel i smiled and thougth about my 
youth when i owned a 1971 chevelle 454. 
not only does the gto sound better, it 
also does everything ten times better 
than my chevelle. for the price in this 
day and age, best buy possible keep 
your foriegn sporst cars and even the 
new mustange, 3000 over sticker. the 
GTO is back and better than ever. pure 
american muscle and sound."
pontiac,gto,2004,MKG, 12/26/2004,One of the best cars for the money,5,"Great car. And the best part of it is 
that there are not many on the road.
You can upgrade it w/ supercharger up 
to 500hp w/o problems and use it as 
everyday."
pontiac,gto,2004,jgenestra, 12/27/2004,2004 GTO,4,"When I read on a car forum the amazing 
discounts on the 04 GTO I could not 
resist especially since I got a total 
of $10,000 in rebates and 
incentives!.  The car is great, and I 
love the overall feel of the car.   As 
a former 02 Camaro SS owner, the 
interior and build quality of the GTO 
is a huge leap forward.  At first I 
did not like the styling, but its 
growing on me.  Once again GM has 
dropped the ball on marketing their 
products correctly, because for the 
money these cars should be selling 
better.  "

so..."
pontiac,gto,2004,hemi335, 01/03/2005,Feeling Youthful,5,"A great car and with GM Card Bonus

Grand Prix's, I would definitely 
consider another when I am done with 
this one...  "
pontiac,gto,2004,DavidC, 01/14/2005,Awesome,4,"My first V8.  Owned many 4 and 6 cyl and turbos.  I Love it.  Power at any time.  Awesome sound under full throttle.  Plenty of comments from bystanders.  THey always ask ""Is it fast?""  My response. Oh yeah, plenty.  The build quality is not typical pontiac for this is my third to own.  Styling is sleeper which I like.  Don't need hoodscoops and other eye candy.  Glad there is not tons of them on the road which makes me feel lucky to own one. My wife even likes to drive it and she didn't care for it at first.  I took the automatic because not interested in shifting gears anymore and can still get a nice chirp shifting into second gear.  Way to go Pontiac with the GTO.  Thanks."
pontiac,gto,2004,diesel, 01/26/2005,Love this car.........,5,"I've owned a lot of new cars and old muscle cars, this GTO drives and rides solid. Lots of fun (and power) too. Will likely get the '05 or '06 at some point."
pontiac,gto,2004,sparke, 10/12/2006,2004 GTO,4,"I bought this car as a 30th bday present to myself.  Got it in silver, had only 800 miles on it for an awesome price!  Wasn't too impressed with the looks until I drove it.  Also looked at other cars in similar class but realized this car was in a class of it's own. Love that there aren't very many around town.  I have only seen 5 others during all my travels in various states.  I am the only one in town.  Had it up to 156 at the last glance against an 06 GTO.  The car has alot of power and a good driver is a great combination.  Love this car."
pontiac,gto,2004,pligman, 02/01/2007,love my GTO,5,"Took it on a 2 week trip out west in September, put 5400 miles on it in 14 days, and never got tired of being in the car. 15 hours the first day and 10 plus on other days, from 1000 feet up to 11,000 feet, car did not skip a beat and averaged 26.4 mpg for the trip, all at or above the speed limit, and in some moments very fast. I will never get rid of it! "
pontiac,gto,2004,Matt, 12/01/2007,2004 GTO,5,"Forget about all of the naysayers that expected a retro looking car like the Mustang. This car fits the bill just fine.  It is fast, handles decent, and is bigger on the inside than it looks.  Trunk space is my only issue because the fuel tank occupies half of it, but mine isn't a daily driver so it isn't a big deal.  The car rocks and is almost everything I could ask for in a new car purchase."

Feel like a kid again and GET THIS 
CAR!!!!"
pontiac,gto,2004,JTAF, 08/28/2004,Modern Muscle Car,4,"This modern muscle car did not have to 
have the GTO name. It is it's own 
muscle car made with today's features 
and technology. This is the first car 
of my era that I can think of that 
could possibly be an icon in the 
future. The 2000's has not seen too 
many strong American cars that have 
the right to be 
considered 'Muscle'(without being $50k 
or higher). I am as excited about this 
as my Ftaher-in-law was when he was my 
age buying his GTO brand new. Who 
would have known then that his car 
would have been such an icon. This is 
history in the making. Thank you 
Pontiac for giving my generation the 
chance to be part of something great!"

3 of those times towed in. Electrical 
issues, transmission won't go into

coolant leaks, battery. What else can 
go wrong. Very disappointed. Paid 
34K for car 2 months later they have

upside down from the start!!! "
pontiac,gto,2004,mbarilla, 12/25/2004,Goat Junk,3,"Too many initial problems:
1) Blemishes in paint
2) Lights misaligned
3) Gear shift knob rattles
4) Needs New rear end after 1500 miles
5) Weatherstrip not attached to door
Also, the car is not fun to drive for a 
performance car.  It handles like a 
very heavy car. Too much plowing into 
corners.  This has to be the worst new 
car I have ever owned in initial 
quality. "
pontiac,gto,2004,Louisville Car Fan, 12/29/2004,Goat with Gremlins,4,"As the owner of a Porsche and Nissan 
Z, I was innitially impressed by the 
quality and performance of the GTO.  
The power and torque are great, but 
the gas mileage should and could be 
much better.  I'm averaging about 15 
miles per gallon mixed driving.  Only 
20 on the highway.  The six speed 
manual forces you to shift from first 
to 4th at certain speeds.  I find the 
feature annoying and dangerous.  It's 
very distracting and requires too much 
effort.  I hope no one has an 
accident. Secondly, my glove box 'fell 
off' with fewer than 900 miles on the 
car. Bad sign. Additionally, the 
defroster does not defog the 
driver/passenger windows. And the 
paint is flawed on the front bumper. "
pontiac,gto,2004,CliffLao, 12/29/2004,GTO- Geared Toward Oppression,2,"Paying $30,300 I was really hoping 
that Pontiac would at least stand 
behind their product if something were 
to go wrong. With only 250 miles on 
the car the transmission started 
coming out of second and first gears 
and would not go into reverse without 
some coaxing. Along with dark gray 
paint spots all over the bright yellow 
exterior, I have already attempted on 
3 different occasions to allow Pontiac 
to correct the problems but they will 
not even acknowledge them. From 
Showcase Pontiac's Service Mgr 
explaining to me that I was not 
driving the car hard enough to Don 
Mackey Pontiac telling me they do not 
know how to work on the car, I CANNOT 
be MORE DISAPOINTED! Lemon vehicle 
meet Lemon LAW!"
pontiac,gto,2004,John, 04/25/2010,Cheap Piece of Junk,1,The nose of this car is cheap plastic. It pulls off whenever the rear of the nose comes in contact with anything on the ground.  The interior is also a very cheap plastic along with the siding under the car.  Overall poor build quality.  This car is not as fast as it should be with this kind of engine in it and the poor gas mileage it gets.  It is heavier than most SUVs so power to weight ratio is terrible!
pontiac,gto,2004,beef, 03/29/2010,Good car!,4,So far so good; I usually get 20-21 mpg in mixed driving. Handles good; great acceleration; decent braking; plenty of room
pontiac,gto,2004,cavu, 01/13/2005,04 GTO A Blast to Drive/Owner,4,Wife loves car. Nimble and responsive. Comfortable. Totally differnt experience than the BMW 3 and 5 series cars in our neighborhood. More of a stand-out bad-boy. The local kids know its different too... Corvette Powered! Some glitches w/ Gauges on deliever. 
pontiac,gto,2004,GOAT CONVERT, 02/03/2005,Great car,4,"Excellent car, everything the edmund's review says it is. Great handling, power, comfort, and surprisingly fuel economy( 28 mpg hwy ) understated appearance, much like the first generation gto looked like grandma's tempest with a hot rod engine. Love the car !! "
pontiac,gto,2004,JP, 02/25/2005,Great Goat,4,"The 2004 Pontiac GTO was built in Australia by a GM owned company called Holden. The car is well built with a tight body, a decent sport suspension which does make it ride a little rough and includes independant rear suspension. The car is equipped with the LS1 Corvette engine of 350hp which provides the GTO with good power. I chose the manual 6-speed for my transmission option. The interior is leather with bucket seats both front and rear. I have not had any problems with the car since I have owned it and I thoroughly enjoy driving this vehicle."
pontiac,gto,2004,Stefanie, 04/15/2005,Love this car,5,"This car is awesome. Not only does it have massive power, but it's sleek style makes for a surprise off the line.  Not a lot of people know about the new GTO, and are always amazed by the performance.  This car is unique and stands out from all the different kinds of powerless Mustangs on the road.  Ultimately a blast to drive and worth every penny."
pontiac,gto,2004,wild willy, 04/30/2005,Best Car I have Ever had,4,With out a doubt the most solidly built car I have ever owned.  I leased this car due to the fact that GM gave them away at the end of 2004 for peanuts.  I am very sorry I did not buy it from the start.  The car is an absolute dream to drive and I take every opportunity to get behind the wheel.  If you have not driven one....Just go do it.!!   
pontiac,gto,2004,Dave Peterson, 11/15/2003,It was perfect,5,"The riding was flauless.  I've always 
grown up in a AMerican made family and 
the Pontiac GTO has had nothing but 
improvements from it's older models.  
It can still live up to its standards. "
pontiac,gto,2004,Rockit_GTO, 05/14/2005,Excellent Sports Car for the Money,4,"Being a former Z28 owner (highly modified), the comparison in quality is unmatched. For a similar level of performance and much better interior design, this car wins hands down. Everytime I fill up with gas people just start looking around and inside the car. All of the comments are very positve. The red leather interior is very eye catching and the detail in the interior is top notch."
pontiac,gto,2004,Brian Hill, 06/10/2005,GTO,5,"I love this car. The power is amazing, I can do 110 mph in 3rd gear. The only problems I have are the super slow moving seats to gain acess to the back and the fact there are no door lock buttons on the inside. Other than that this car is a dream on gas. I get 29 mpg on the highway(I have the 6 speed). Oh and by the way the handling is not as bad as they make it out to be."
pontiac,gto,2004,Charles Goin, 06/29/2005,Love my Goat,4,"Awesome car, handling is on par with my 97' 328i it replaced. Horsepower is more than you could ever ask for.  Fit and finish are the best I have ever seen from GM, especially in the interior.  Speaking of which these are the best most comfortable seats i have sat in..  Add to that the limited production its like driving a Maserati or somethign equally as rare. You rarely ever pass yourself, and when you do its an occasion."
pontiac,gto,2004,robertkcal, 12/22/2003,What a Machine,4,"No matter what the magazines say, this 
car was worth every penny! I've gotten 
alot of positive comments on it's 
looks, and the enterior is really nice.
And of course the power is the icing 
on the cake.
The things I look for when purchasing 
a car are: Looks, power, good radio, 
and quality. This car has them all.
With only 18,000 built a year, for 3 
years, I'm totally happy that I have 
mine now."
pontiac,gto,2004,JC, 08/11/2005,2004 GTO,4,"Just bought an '04 Goat and I loved it...for 2 days.  Back to the dealership and now I am waiting for parts to be imported from Australia to overhaul the manual transmisson.  Reverse stopped working.  Why are these parts not on hand???  For 2 days, this was my dream car.  I can't wait to get it back but I'm afraid I may have a lemon.  Pontiacs are not exactly known for having the best transmissions out there."

happy with my vehicle purchase."
pontiac,gto,2004,Drew, 09/13/2005,Love this car,4,So I just came home with a Yellow 04 GTO and I am loving everything about this car. It has the power of an american muscle car but not the crappy quality of the majority of american cars today since it's built in Austrailia. It really does have the build quality like a european car but the raw power of an american bad boy car! Yes some may say the styling is bland but I personally get looks and people trying to talk to me about the car all the time. My girlfriend gets annoyed when we pull up to a light and another guy is trying to yell at us through the window to talk about the car. At first I wasn't totally sure about the yellow color choice but its grown on me and I wouldnt change a thing!

pontiac,gto,2004,Happy GTO Owner, 09/25/2005,Hands Down -- Best Car I've Ever Owned!,5,"This car is awesome!  Bought in Nov 2004, it just gets better all the time.  It looks like a grownups car, drives (and sounds) like a teenagers car.  Interior is roomy and extremely comfortable -- 2 day road trip with 4 adults was great (mildly annoying getting in and out of back seat).  Best road trip car I've ever had -- ride is smooth and all the power you need.  Took it through the mountains in Colorado and never felt so safe -- barely touched the brakes going down -- mostly downshifted.  Getting on the highway is like taking off in a lear jet.  Drive it once and you're hooked!"
pontiac,gto,2004,GTO, 01/12/2004,The GTO has finally here !!!!,4,"Good Car, delivers 100% and more, 
great engine and manual transmission

confused with the exterior - Plain 
looking but clean,not impressed with 
the jelly been design.

few more effordable cars with Power in

pontiac,gto,2004,DABT, 01/16/2004,The Goat Returns!,4,"The 2004 GTO is an awesome car!  I 
actually like the understated exterior 
look.  The interior is very well done, 
with excellent head room, and 
comfortable front and rear seating. The 
Blaupunkt stereo is also a nice touch.  
However, for me, the new GTO is all 
about performance.  I have the six-
speed manual, and have found the power 
and ride of my car to be simply 
fantastic.  Bottom line, you are 
getting Corvette-like performance for 
$20,000 less.  For me, this car 
delivers the goods at a fair price."
pontiac,gto,2004,ashley002, 01/17/2004,2004 gto,4,"I cant believe the performance and feel

vehicle to anyone!!!"
pontiac,gto,2004,Steve, 10/27/2005,2004 GTO,4,Fun car to drive. Hugs the road well.  Excellent exceleration.  I had a couple of cosmetic problems but they were taken care of at the dealership.  Even though everyone is complaining about the exterior design every one seems to notice the car.

Comfortable and affordable, I paid under 23k for it, technically used but new.  I didn't realize all the wheel hop everyones talking about.  CAGS is annoying and there is slightly too much body roll, but what do you expect for the ride you get.  Brakes could be improved as well as the sound system.  Overall very easy car to drive and I'm sure glad I got the 6 speed.  Love the styling, and I just laugh at the people who say it looks like a cavalier b/c they don't have any taste.

It is quiet and smooth riding with an almost luxurious interior. Very civil and predictable putting around town and in the parking lots. But when you head up the entrance ramp to the highway and push down on the throttle, the thrust is unbelieveable. No complaints about anything on the car. The stereo is adequate. The mileage has been between 20-21mpg consistently with the automatic. With 350HP that is pretty good, I think. A 117HP car would need to get 60mph to match its MPG/HP efficientcy."

skip shift feature. It's not the easiest
thing to get used to I've been shifting
1,3,5 for years. I'm hoping that someone
dosen't run into the back of me while
I'm struggeling to find a usable gear."
pontiac,gto,2004,GoatMan, 02/17/2004,Great!,4,"Great performance and handling.  Very 
nice interior but truck space is 
limited due to moving the gas tank.  
Styling is too conservitive but oncce 
behind the wheel that goes away.  This 
is what the GTO is all about lots of 
HP in a small passenger car."
pontiac,gto,2004,My Goat, 02/17/2004,Better than I had imagined,4,"I have owned several Corvettes and a 
Z28 and was looking for something that 
was a little more livable.  When I saw 
the GTO I thought that was exactly what 
I was looking for.  The car handles 
great, is very comfortable, does not 
have the typical tacky Pontiac 
design ""features"" and has a wonderful 
engine.  Some argue that the car does 
not look like the original GTO, but few 
cars look like the cars from over 
thirty years ago.  I also like the 
somewhat conservative styling.  The 
more I drive it the more I am impressed 
with it."
pontiac,gto,2004,TJthrows, 02/18/2004,WOW,4,"Anyone who complains about this car 
must not have drove one.  I bought mine 
and love it.  Smooth but responsive 
ride and loads of power.  Not many cars 
advise you to shift from 1st to 4th if 
you are not getting on it.  Interior is 
superb.  Exterior styling is sleek and 
looks great.  I know it is not the eye 
grabbe the trans am was, but at every 
stop light, people stop and looks at 
what i am driveing.  I have no 
complaints."

exciting to drive as my first GTO was

I've ever owned.  From its understated 
exterior, to its Corvette 
underpinnings, to it excellently 
appointed interior the GTO is the 
perfect car.  The $33,000 price tag is 
a real bargain given the performance 
and total vehicle package.  In the 
interior you will not find another 
vehicle with better seats.  The 
controls are clearly marked and easy 
to operate.  There is not a lot 
of ""fluff"" inside to distract the 
driver, just a great stereo, good HVAC 
control, a non-GM cruise control (this 
is good) and a trip computer with 
meaningul information."

pontiac,gto,2004,Knowitall, 03/06/2004,A quick fix for the Headlights...,4,"A fix for the headlights is to aim them 
up a bit.  Its not that they are not 
bright enough, all cars are the same, 
its that they shine too close to the 
front of the car. Adjust them up just 
six inches against a wall.  

To do this:
1.  Open the hood and locate the 
headlight adjustment screw (maybe look 
in manual or ask a mechanic).

2.  At night, adjust this screw so the 
headlight shines approximently 6"" 
higher.  DO NOT adjust it up so high 
that it shines into the backseat of 
cars in front of you, thats too high 
and annoying to others (extremely!).

I know this will work.  I don't know 
why GM has taken to adjusting them too 
low (same on my '97 Z28)."

where the impressive interior stops.    
The stereo isnt very clear and not 
very loud (even for factory).  Also the

plastic and pops out of place when

fit and finish are better than anything
I've seen from any GM product in years.
Unfortunatly the shifter is a piece of
junk.  Each and every morning it's like

get it in gear. Thankfully my dealer has
agreed to make any fixes that they can.

ware, the sun visors feels 
like they were made out of card board

hand. I have no doubt that the power 
train will hold up, I just dont think 
that 31k is what this car is worth.

Torrid Red six speed manual."
pontiac,gto,2004,Robert Hutchins, 06/16/2004,The Goat is back!,4," I had to choose between a Corvette

definately looks better, it has one 
thing working against it. It looks 
like a Corvette. The GTO's non-flashy 
styling will probably save me a couple 
of tickets.
 The interior: I find it simply 
amazing that GM was able to create 
something so awe inspiring and 
functional. I can easily seat 4 adults 
comfortably.
 Although the gates are a little 
questionable and the shift is a little 
long it is not unreasonable. Nothing a 
short shifter can't fix! The drive 
shaft/Axle halves could stand to be a 
little larger. Wheel hop is a mild

pontiac,gto,2004,Dane E., 07/23/2004,Dane's Review on the new GTO,4,"This is one amazing vehicle.  I have 
owned the car for a little more than 4 
months and have around 5,500 miles on 
her.  I still get excited every time I 
get behind the wheel.  I love it when 
I am stopped at a light and people ask 
me to roll my window down so they can 
ask questions about it.  And to see 
people driving by doing double takes 
is great too.  One of the most 
comfortable vehicles I have ever been 
in.  This car comes highly recommended 
by me."

powerful, but it is one of the funnest 
cars I have ever driven.  There is no 
other car u can get for 30 Gs that 
gives you the speed, comfort, and nice 
interior of the Pontiac GTO."

This vehicle is awesome. The performance
is outstanding. Interior and exterior
finishing on the car is awesome. The
comfort level is very high. This car is
most definately a winner on all levels. 

Sure, it doesn't look like the ""old

think not. Awesome. Simply awesome!!!"
pontiac,gto,2004,Packerman, 08/03/2004,I Love My New 2004 GTO,4,"I just bought my GTO 07/31 and it 
is a BLAST to drive, the power is 
great and the throaty sound of the 
exhaust reminds me of my High School 
days when everyone had a muscle car.  
The rear bucket seats are cool and the 
instrument cluster is very impressive 
I almost forgot the suede on the doors 
and in the front.  I like the brushed 
aluminum finish this is not my 
Father's Pontiac.  The interior is 
also made with very high quality parts 
and materials unlike other Pontiac's 
which kept me from getting a Grand 
Prix last year (I am very thankful for 
that).  The GTO is PURE MUSCLE with a 
little luxury thrown in to keep you 
happy.  It is a mixture of a 67 
Firebir"

pontiac,gto,2004,BILLMAN, 08/24/2004,Driving is fun again,4,"As an owner of many of the late 60's 
early 70's muscle cars, I was one of 
the many that were a bit leary of the 
release of the 'new' gto. Most of us 
said the same thing...""Well, it sure 
don't look like a GTO."" But after many 
months of shopping for a new car, I 
found myself repetedly returning to the 
Pontiac dealer. After several test 
drives, I just could'nt get enough!
It may not have the reto look, but 
after driving one for 5 months, the gto 
has earned my respect. It has the 
muscle and grit I remember of the gto's 
of the old days, with the agility and 
grace of modern technology. For me, 
this GTO has renewed my faith in GM, 
and, made driving fun again!"
pontiac,gto,2004,TChicago, 08/30/2004,Thumbs Up,4,"I waited until I got some miles on my 
new GTO before submitting a review.  I 
now have over three thousands miles on 
the odometer and I have not had one 
problem or any squeaks/rattles with 
this car.  The car is very quick (I 
have the automatic) and comfortable.  I 
can drive the GTO like a regular car 
98% of the time (freeway commuting) I 
even have room for a babys seat in the 
back.  When I want a sports car all I 
have to do is hit the throttle.  This 
is the best car I have ever had in my 
driveway.  I think the GTO most 
practical sports car on the market.  I 
made the right choice."
pontiac,gto,2004,Antonio de Armas, 08/26/2004,"I like mine black, please.",5,"Sunday morning coming home from Toys 
R'Us drove past the Pontiac dealership 
and stopped just to look around. Never 
saw or heard of this car before.  What 
is it?  Had to bend down to see the 
side plate, GTO 5.7 L. What? Got behind 
the wheel, nice! Salesman comes out of 
nowhere and sits on the passenger side. 
Want o test drive it? Gave me the key 
and I started the dammed thing. Rooom! 
I could feel the power in my hands as 
the seat vibrated, room, roooom. 
Shifted to drive and the whole car 
tilted backwards. Stepped on the 
accelerator and I felt the G force as I 
was pushed against the seat. Awsome 
machine!!!! Bought it. Expensive and a 
thrill to drive."
pontiac,gto,2004,50+ CPA, 09/06/2004,New Goat,4,"This is a true throw back to the muscle

better then my 426 hemi, 440 Plymouth

the seat is extremely comfortable and
after exiting the car my back feels 
great. This adds to the overall driving

better design, rear is cool, front

fun safely and with authority on the
road. I have the automatic, and after
a recent dyno tune and tranny 
adjustment, the car has a performance
level close to a manual transmission.
The 'sleeper' look keeps me out of
traffic court, as does the necessary
radar detector. This car is a bargain
at MSRP--the deals offered right now
make it an absolute steal."
pontiac,gto,2004,Rockets Red Glare, 09/21/2004,Torrid Red - Streak - 2004 GTO,4,"I am very impressed with the
performance, build quality and ride.

This is a BIG automobile with a real
(comfortable) back seat.  A true 2+2
sports coupe. I choose the six speed
version to avoid the ""gas guzzler"" tax
and because I prefer a standard
transmission.

The design is clean and contrary to most
opinions, I like it!  The color, Torrid
red, really pops!  GM also offered $3500
cash back with 2.9% financing for five
years.  Altogether, I was able to reduce 
the price to $25,200.00 from $33,179.00.

What a deal, world class performance for
the price of a family car!

pontiac,gto,2004,BobthePhotoGuy, 09/23/2004,Maintaining the concept,4,"Many people keep refering to the fact 
that the GTO doesn't look like a 
muscle car. Well a lot of that is the 
perception of history. The original 
GTO was a plain jane Pontiac Tempest 
with a common styling for it era. 
Pontiac took this everyday two 
door 'going to church' car and dropped 
in a powerful drivetrain, added a hood 
scoop, exhaust and a bigger set of 
shoes. With the New GTO, they took 
a well established up to date styled 
car, the Holden Monaro, dropped in a 
powerful drivetrain and added a 
healthy exhaust. Sound familiar?? 
The only thing missing is the 
hoodscoop. Of course with the new 
technology in 30 years, the creature 
comforts are much stronger."

put together.  I'm not crazy about the 
styling of the rear of the car.  The 
interior is comfortable, with lots of 
leg room, and well put together. 
 It has much more power then you can 
use and get wonderful gas mileage for a 
car with that much power.  So far, it 
has averaged 19.2 for all our driving.  
It handles very well and ride is a 
little harsh but no more then expected

ratings on it's styling but I really 
think this car has nice clean lines 
and it is devoid of any typical excess 
Pontiac cladding and ground effects. I 
like the fact that it doesn't scream 
out, ""here I am."" The sleeper factor 
is awesome. The GTO is a very well 
built car. The interior is first class 
and I don't ever expect a shake or 
rattle. Performance is beautiful. The 
last car I can recall with as much 
factory power on tap is the 1986 Buick 
Grand National. The LS1 with 6 speed 
provides plenty of good old American 
tire shredding horsepower and torque - 
you have to love that. The only, and I 
mean only negatives I have on this car 
is the trunk space."
pontiac,gto,2004,Ronald Hall, 10/09/2004,GTO,4,"I drive 35 miles each way to and from 
work. 
The GTO is a real fun car to drive. 
It's a fast car that will easily beat 
the Mustang GT. 
My brother has a 2003 Mustang Cobra and 
we ran them 3 times. I won the first 
one but unfortunately he won the 
following two but none of the three 
races were run away wins and 2 of the 
three were decided by less than a car 
length.
My brother likes my car as much as he 
likes his and concedes that my interior 
is much better with the exception of 
the stereo. We both agree that the GTO 
stereo sucks and that my cousins Monte 
Carlo has a better stock stereo.
In close I guess it's like this. The 
GTO is a refined sports coupe that's 
fun to drive with great power."
pontiac,gto,2004,TrueBlueGTO, 10/12/2004,The GTO that could,4,"I feel the new GTO is incredible. Yes, the new 
GTO marketing doesn't hold a candle to those 
of the 60's. True, it's the first GTO w/o a 
Hurst shifter and hood scoop. But have the 
naysayers driven this thing? Apparently not. 
It goes like no factory GTO before it has and 
has more features than Bonnevilles (minus 
OnStar, moonroof, and heated seats). 
Standard.  

More would have embraced it had dealers not   
been greedy w/$5000 premiums. 

Yes, I long for trunk space. I have had a few 
oddball glitches occur, but overall I love it. 
Nothing bites my backside more than people 
who gripe about things they haven't even 
taken a moment to firsthand experience. 
Before you base an opinion on it, drive it."

Beltroics Vector Accelerometer from 
Jegs.  The factory stats on the 6sp is 
0-60 in 5.3 and the 1/4 mile in 13.8 @ 
105.  After alot of practice on the 
starts, my best time WITH a witness in 
the car is 0-60 in 4.70 flat and the 
1/4 mile in 13.35 at 106.  I knew from 
magazine articles that the car was 
faster than advertised by Pontiac.  I 
had seen sub 5 second 0-60 runs and a 
13.53 1/4 by muscle car mag.  By the 
way, if you want to look it up or don't 
believe me, the Beltronics Vector FX2

At first peopel will look and then look 
even harder to see what it is. This 
machine in my mind is the equivilent to 
any overseas vehicle that would like to 
tango. For the price it is the best you 
can ask for, pure muscle and respect. I 
think the only downfall is the sound

that actually own them.  Everyone has 
an opinion...  I am sufficiently 
satisfied with my GTO.  Performance-
wise...couldn't ask for more.  
Exterior, I could agree that more could 
have been done, but then again, if GM 
built the car to have 'louvers, scoops, 
vents...etc' then what would car owners 
get to add??  I look at my GTO as a 
blank canvas for me to custom.  GM did 
the hard part by installing a killer

Trans Am it replaced. It's faster, has 
a drop dead gourgous interior and is 
tight as a drum. Driving it after 
owning two T/A's in a row takes a bit 
of getting used to but it's well worth 
the wait. It was like going from a 
shifter cart to a Formula racer. It has 
done things in the handling department 
the F-cars could never approach. The 
IRS makes a big difference in keeping 
the rubber on the road. This car seems 
German in it's execution. Fit and

the best ever for a GM car. Though the

incredible.  I was anticipating that it

The interior is fantastic and the seats 
are the best I have ever sat in and yet 
hold you firmly. The fit and finish of 
the interior is by far the best I have 
seen in a GM product.

Suspension is tight, and yet on the 
highway is smooth as silk. Reminds me 
of a 8 series BMW, but with a better 
overall ride. With a fully independant 
rear end with posi-traction grip and 
handling are well communicated to the 
wheels. 

While the suspension may feel German, 
the sweet sound and powerband is all 
American V8. The horsepower is right

put you in your seat."

as excited as the first time I drove 
it.  The car is extremly fun to drive, 
and the power is awesom.  The pick up 
you feel when you accelerate really 
puts you back in your seat.  I have had 
my GTO up to 145 mph and it drives just 
as smooth as it does at 65 mph.  Though 
I do not recomend driving that fast.  
In my opion I would recommend the GTO

I have had a bit of trouble making back tires last, it's so much fun to drive. On the highway, it's a pleasure to drive. It's very smooth and quiet, it gets 24mpg on the highway and about 15mpg in the city. I average about 17mpg in mostly city driving.

I'm a gear head at heart and at time I forget to do work the car needs because I don't like to work on it. Not that its hard work or difficult,I just rather be driving. No car has made me feel this way up to now. But I assure you,soon enough I will do plenty of engine mods.

 For the money I really feel when it comes to used american muscle/sports cars that do everything ""well"". You really can't find a better car in market,I'm sure of it."

A 2003 Ford Mustang Cobra, 2005 Corvette C-6 or a 2005/06 GTO. The Vette and the GTO offered 400Hp of true aspirated engine. The Cobra offered 390 with the factory Super Charger. The GTO had four seats. Also honestly, how many GTO's do you see compared to the mustang and Vette? My choice was obvious.  I needed to put the test on it. I drove it from North Carolina to California and back. No problems the entire trip. When I got back there were some electronic issues. Nothing a few hundred cant fix. I later invested about $10,000 into the engine to make it a real 535 RWHP beast. I love my GTO."

The only technical issues I had so far were a water pump replacement at 40k, engine temp gauge problem (electronic part had to be replaced) at 16k. Looks like I got lucky compared to most of GTO owners. A downside is the poor quality of the car. The shifter is wobbly and not precise, the seam on the rear driver side seat is opening up and about to burst open (nobody ever sits on that seat), the paint on the driverside doorhandle is chipping off (pass. side handle had to be repainted already)."
pontiac,gto,2005,chuckdi, 05/25/2014,2005 GTO Sport Appearance Package (SAP),5,"I bought an 05 GTO with 18K miles with the sport appearance package or SAP which includes quad exhausts, cool side skirts, SAP front bumper and grills. Paint is Cyclone Gray.
Added a JHP color matched gage pod for volts and engine oil pressure, chrome tail lights with red LED's, chrome aluminum wheels, GM Performance high flow oil pump, headers and 160 degree therm. Use ALT friction modifier to engine oil (6 oz.) and 1 oz. to power steering. ALT claims 48% reduction in friction. ALT is Advanced Lubrication Technology. Removed rear spoiler and painted trunk lid.

At 54K miles, replaced rotors and pads and replaced auto trans fluid and differential fluid with GM friction modifier.

pontiac,gto,2005,paul_johnson_gto, 10/14/2009,amazing,4,my car is the best car i have ever bought. i love my car. i would never trade it for another car. this car is smooth looking and gtes up and goes. it a great car for the price.
pontiac,gto,2005,torridgto, 12/27/2010,Blue GTO,4,"This car is a screamer, I put a k/n CAI, and a borla exhaust in my car.
Now it sounds great, it sounded good when i first got it, and could lay down some rubber but now i could burn the tires right off if i wanted too (not like i couldn't when it was stock). last year i went on a trip to Colorado and the ride just never gets old its such a comfortable ride i Just love this car.
Everybody should have one!!"
pontiac,gto,2005,DJ, 10/27/2005,Best Performance Sports Coupe Available!,5,"Overall the 0-60 time of 4.6 seconds (I've gotten it to 60 in 4.3 seconds) and the amazing rush of performance every time I step on the gas makes this car an absolute dream! If you want big horsepower, big torque and a big engine then this is the car for you. The interior is extra comfortable (I could sleep in those seats) and the sound that comes from those huge tail pipes is a delight. Handling A+, Ride A+, Performance A+, what more do you want? This is at another level than what it's often compared to, like the Mustang. Don't get me wrong, I like Mustangs (traded in a 2002 Mustang GT for my GTO) but this car is just at another level. It's the best way to get a Vette and save $15,000!"
pontiac,gto,2005,John Fischer, 07/04/2006,Great Performance Car,4,"This is the best new car I've ever bought.  No issues to date, and it's 7 months old.  This car is a blast to drive, and puts a grin on my face every time I start it up. I know the car has been blasted by critics for its looks, but I think the 2005-06 models look great.  Sometimes it's nice to be driving a sleeper :)   "
pontiac,gto,2005,Blondegirl, 03/22/2005,Great Car!,4,"I bought my GTO in October and I love it!  It is a little tricky to drive in the snow, but some sandbags in the back helped that.  The car looks great and runs fantastic!  I would definitely recommend them!"
pontiac,gto,2005,Goatin, 05/21/2005,Great Car,4,"Simple: Best car I've ever owned.  The performance and build quality are absolutely unmatched in this price range. I also love the uniqueness of this car. I've currently seen only one other GTO on the road other than mine. I've heard a lot of complaints about the styling, but I've been getting constant compliments on how nice the car looks since the day I brought it home. Awesome car."
pontiac,gto,2005,NoBMWforME, 07/29/2005,Drive a GTO forget your BMW!!,5,"I sold my BMW to get this car.  I took a bath on the BMW resale, as they do not hold their value (mine had only 34K miles after 5 years!)  The GTO has been a fantastic car.  I find the styling appeals to me and my family and is, to us, more mature and, say, european rather than screaming ""LOOK AT ME"" that some others need.  I get more than my share of looks from those that know what it is.  I replaced the goofy rear spoiler with a more sedate spoiler.  I love this car!!"
pontiac,gto,2005,Keith Gander, 08/10/2006,2005 GTO,4,"The fit and finish on this car is great. The best I've seen on a GM product.  The LS2 engine is a dream come true, 400hp right off the lot, and it was $25,000 to $30,000 cheaper than a Corvette. The suspension reminds me of a Bonneville or Park Avenue (to soft).  I had Hotchkiss sway bars installed front and rear, plus JBA headers, Borla exhaust, and a K&N intake. This car is performance bargain!"
pontiac,gto,2005,Doug, 10/26/2006,add to my other review,5,Reviewers complain of the small truck well that is our safety regulations which makes it ultra safe for rear end collisions.  Also it has  a larger tank at 18 gallons which takes up the trunk space.....the Australian version probably has a lot more room in the trunk.  Also i got 27.5 mpg with a/c on a trip in the summer. the fuel mileage gage is off by 10% often when i check my mileage the old fashioned way.
pontiac,gto,2005,tyler, 01/09/2007,lovin' it,4,"I bought mine about 4 months ago and i love it. i had it supercharged about a month ago so now i have 560 hp and 530 ft lbs of torque. I was blowing the doors off of mustangs right out of the box, but now... i like virtually everything about the car except the shifter as everyone has said and the handling is just a little bit too soft. other than that it's an awesome muscle car that can be tuned to beat anything for very little money. you need to get one... quick"
pontiac,gto,2005,Mike, 08/19/2007,OK DESIGN BUT KO PERFORMANCE,4,"When I first test drove the God-like car in the GTO, I fell in love with it. I first looked at what's under the hood..and boy it was beautiful. The engine itself was proably the size of the Goat's  trunk..Once I test drove the car, I realized that the pickup was incrediblely fast. The steering was responsive and tight.. However going over bumps knocked the car around a little bit. but how can I complain with 400 horses and 385 torque at a resonable price? I feel like a king driving around in the GTO. Most peoplem have never seen one which is a good thing, its not like a WRX STI or Z. And for those who do. They understand what it's capable of. For those who don't, well they're in for a big suprise"
pontiac,gto,2005,FatheadCrash, 06/24/2009,GTO a GO!,4,"My experience with my '05 GTO is one word... AMAZING!!! it is the most fun car I could of ever hoped to own. I am the envy and focal point of the road wherever I go. A stock 400 hp and trq... oh yea... a 6.0 pushrod... 30 lbs lighter than a mustang GT's 4.6... it isnt even a side by side comparison. its faster than the new challenger SRT8, charger, and keeps up with a shelby gt 500 for half the price.the exterior styling is captivating, the interior sporty, comfortable, and bold. the original muscle car was a gto... and the legend lives on!"
pontiac,gto,2005,GMinTheDriveway, 02/11/2005,You won't regret it!,4,"This is not your father's GTO.  This is a modern muscle machine - a 2+2 Corvette with an added stealth advantage.  Some criticize the so- called ""jellybean"" styling, but inside and out this is a beautiful car with power to spare.  The clutch is pretty heavy for stop&go driving, but the 400 lb/ft of torque allow you to simply ease out the clutch without touching the gas.  Go ahead, it won't stall like a gutless high-revving VTEC.  This is pure adrenaline in a sophisticated touring package.  In the words of Ferris Bueller ""it is so choice.  If you have the means, I highly recommend you pick one up"""
pontiac,gto,2005,Mark , 09/01/2006,You won't believe this,4,"Well, Love the GTO..except that the motor blew at 2800 miles. Pontiac said it was our fault...seems like it uses oil like an old lawnmower. Actually folks, the secret internal memo to Pontiac tells them to warn customers of GTOs to check the oil every 500 miles. And, yes folks, this GTO even with a new motor (and that's a whole other story) burns 1 quart of oil every 500 miles. So check your dipsticks regularly. The big thing now is that there are NO part available for these Holdens. An unfortunate incident left my GTO damaged in the front and it has been in the body shop for 3 MONTHS now while they try and find parts. RIGHT NOW there are NO front struts available for any GTOs in the USA..."
pontiac,gto,2005,Vinnie C., 05/18/2008,Plain Jane. NOT!!!,4,"I've owned Pontiacs, real Pontiacs, my 1st was a 69 gp. Had a lot of fun in that car at 18 yrs old. Now at 37 yrs old I'm having more fun driving than ever before. The look might be plain Jane but the performance is not. Besides the original gto was an ordinary tempest with a 389 engine, not flashy just powerful. I've driven lots of ""performance"" cars & this car performs with the best of them all for a $33k out the door price. I miss those old Pontiacs but I wouldn't trade this new one for one of them. They never got 24 mpg hwy with the a/c on at 75 mph, & not to many of them didn't overheat with the a/c on. Don't forget the 400 hp 6.0 that sends the car down the track at about 13.1sec. Awesome car! "
pontiac,gto,2005,Ken, 06/09/2005,Did not meet expectations,2,Maybe I was just blinded by the thought of a new vehicle but this car does not perform as expected. My Dodge SRT-4 is much faster than my six-speed GTO and cost over 10k less. The interior is the best I can say about this car. They should have put more into the engine. 
pontiac,gto,2005,e. m., 05/08/2009,verry fast,4,no complaints except it could have a little better suspesion and a better stereo
pontiac,gto,2005,Steve, 04/16/2005,Power to spare,4,This a quick car NOT for the teenager too much car for the person that wants to relive the 60's muscle car.
pontiac,gto,2005,GTO48, 11/04/2005,Nothing like it on the road today!,5,"This thing is bad to the bone!  I have owned numerous ""fast cars""  Buick Grand Nationals, Mustang GT, as well as a 427 powered '67 Chevelle for old school muscle.  Nothing comapres to my GTO.  The fit and finish are outstanding for $30,000.  Oh and did I mention 400 HP?  Disappointments are few and far between...  Small trunk space, slow seat movement for rear seat ingress.  Who cares!  I didn't buy it to haul stuff in the trunk or the back seat.  Which by the way will fit a 6 foot tall passenger with ease once you do get the front seats out of the way.  Pontiac hit a home run with this bad boy.  If other car makers followed Pontiac's lead, I'd need a bigger garage!"
pontiac,gto,2005,danno-SS, 11/12/2005,F-Body convert,4,"Traded in a 2002 A4 SS Camaro (SLP 335HP) for a 2005 M6 GTO, comparison follows:  Engine: GTO. LS2 has noticeable better low-end torque than an LS1, <cars have similar power/weight>. The LS2s electronic throttle body is responsive to even the slightest of inputs, ultra-smooth power delivery.  Exhaust: GTO. True Duals give the GTO a deeper, more menacing tone than the optional SLP cat-back.   Suspension: Tie. Much higher ride height and softer suspension in the GTO. The goat has great turn-in feel but not quite the same grip as the SS. The GTOs IRS does well in keeping the rear from skipping during maneuvers in broken pavement.  Interior: GTO. No contest. "
pontiac,gto,2005,david baum, 07/13/2006,05 gto,5,car is way fast and handles like no othe pony car ever. right out of the box just all the car . big bang for the buck too.
pontiac,gto,2005,Rodney, 10/19/2007,This Goat can't be beat,4,"Anyone who has ever sat/driven a GTO always comes out praising the car's amazing acceleration, handling, and particularly its interior design. You'd be hard pressed to find a more luxurious inviting interior in a car within this price range. It's smooth enough for daily commutes and long trips, and can hit you with the violence of all 400 Hp at any moment. For half the price you get a Corvette with seating for four (real rear seats by the way, not the child seats other cars like the RX-8 and 350Z have), whats not to love about this car.  "
pontiac,gto,2005,fmartin, 07/15/2008,"Hey GT500KR, bring it on!",4,"Bought new in 05, 19,000 miles now. Dealership was excellent to work with. Service is by different dealer, also excellent experience. No service issues at all, this car is very dependable. Had cam, headers, torque converter, cold air intake and some other upgrades done. Total investment < $38k. Quicker than cars twice the price. I like the 'non-retro' look, it's a Lion in a Lamb suit. I get thumbs up from all other high performance drivers... Vettes, Mustangs, Chargers, BMW M5s, etc. It surprises all of them. The car is a blast to drive on the street or on the track. An awesome package. "
pontiac,gto,2005,05worldclass, 09/10/2008,05 GTO Feedback,4,Previous Car to This was a BMW 740 I SPORT.An Excellent Car with Great Driving Manners. What a surprise the Quality/Fit Finish and Performance that the GTO offers.The Handling is Just as Good as the BMW and Includes a Nice Ride as well. Also had a Mint 2000 Mustang GT 4.6/5 Speed (NO COMPARISON). This Car is an Awesome Value and The Aussies Totally Have Their S-T Together compared to GM Quality Over HERE. Try One. You Will love it!
pontiac,gto,2005,Fast Fun and Quality, 02/25/2009,"Fast, Fun and Beautiful 2005 GTO",4,"After my first test drive in this GTO I knew it was going to be mine. I have owned the GTO for approximately 1 year and still can't wait to drive it. With a small investment including a chip, exhaust and intake, this car has truly become a beast. You can drive the GTO to work on a daily basis with no mechanical issues. Caution: all vehicles on the roadway think of the 6.0 GTO as a threat and will attempt to race you,  Ferrari, Porsche, Mustang, SRT-8. I get questions about this car at every service shop. If you purchase a GTO be prepared to love your ride, it is a fun beautiful car."
pontiac,gto,2005,Metro, 03/20/2009,Awesome!!!!!,5,"I had a 99 Mustang Cobra for 2 years & it was great! (320 HP) The GTO puts that to SHAME! yesterday the police called & said I had cows out, I hopped on the freeway & was running 130mph in 4th gear & it wasnt red lined! (still had 5th & 6th to go but traffic was too heavy) The cobra would red line at 128mph in 4th & it was only a five speed! It didnt even have overdrive, 5th gear was a 1:1 ratio. This is the strongest and fastest car I have ever been in! I bought it on 3-13-09 & the original owner was 75 & it only had 16500 miles on it. If you find one that aint ragged out, you will love it! & you cant beat the price for the 400HP!"
pontiac,gto,2005,OldSarge, 05/18/2009,All Go-Bland Show,4,"I bought my 2005 GTO in March 06 .  It had sat on the dealer's lot since the previous July.  I got it for invoice plus $3500 cash back, plus $600 more than my trade in was worth.  I had the intake, entire exhaust, sway bars, and shocks swapped out for high performance replacements, plus had the ECM modified to take out the 140mph governor.  What a car!!! It will melt it's rear tires!! Great seats, excellent forward view.  Of course, very fast.  I had previously owned a beefed up '69 Road Runner (during the early '70's), and a supercharged '94 Camaro Z28 (during the '90's).  This car beats them both, hands down. I'm glad it didn't sell well.  The dummies don't know what they missed."
pontiac,gto,2005,jrssr, 01/22/2008,Super charged 05 GTO.,4,"I really enjoy driving this car. It is a blast on the track and on the road. It handles very well especially with the right rubber under it. I have super charged the LS2 and it is a beast. The torque and power band is unbelivable. It is a true sleeper as the body style is under stated and there are not many on the road or track. I actually had a guy in a C-5 Corvette that got upset when I passed him and kept pulling ahead of him with 3 people in my car. He could not catch me let alone keep up. This car is the best deal on the market for the package that you get for the price. I have had no problems with it although I only have a little over 13,000 miles on it now. What a car it is!"
pontiac,gto,2005,WARREN DAVIS, 02/11/2005,The All New Pontaic GTO,4,This new car has great speed and cornering. It has a new race car look. Perfect to show youself off in. I love my new toy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
pontiac,gto,2005,Michelle Alava, 02/25/2005,The BEST car I've ever driven,4,"I've ALWAYS wanted a Corvette, but could not swallow the price tag... Now I have my Corvette engine, but half the price... Same leather,stereo system, performance as the vette,and to my mind a FANTASTIC looking car.  LOVE this car... will probally stay with the GTO's for quite a long time."
pontiac,gto,2005,Bryce, 02/28/2005,Great Car,5,"This is by far better than my 04 vett. I am going to get rid of my BMW and Vett, this is two cars in one, for faction of the price. I was forced to rate Reliabilty, I've only done 700 miles in it, so how can I rate this."
pontiac,gto,2005,David, 03/26/2005,GReat performance great car,5,"The GTO is a great car for a driver who likes to be comfortable, likes driving fast and doesn't care on getting the highest quality interior.  If there was a short coming on this car, the crumby interior would have to be it"
pontiac,gto,2005,Wyatt Smith, 04/07/2005,GTO rating,4,The GTO has strong acceleration and is a well balanced vehicle. Steering is nutural and the seats are supportive during spirited driving. The traction control system was inoperative when the vehicle was delivered. Took a week to repair. 
pontiac,gto,2005,JAy ZEe, 04/08/2005,yeah,4,"Buy this and forever be king of the street! Great car, its a sleeper, noone knows its a gto untill you drop the clutch and speed ahead and they see it on the back. best coup i have ever ownd and i have ownd a corvette,a mustange, and a 840ci. "
pontiac,gto,2005,Brian Faust, 04/08/2005,It's a great car,4,I test drove the new GT Mustangs then decided to give the GTO a shot. Wow.. what a car. The quality of workmanship from the quality paint job to the stitching on the shifter boot and all points in between makes this a superior vehicle. The suspension is tight and handling on  windy back roads is excellant. You will feel any rough conditions due to the stiff suspension. Breaking distance is  good and acceleration through the gears is awsome. The Blaupunkt sound system is is top notch. The only negatives I have are the wheels are just so so..I'm definately going to upgrade them and the trunk space is tiny-- golf clubs bearly fit.
pontiac,gto,2005,american legend, 04/11/2005,the real deal,4,all power best bang for the buck under 40k handles better than it goes...plenty of power and style!
pontiac,gto,2005,Tony, 04/11/2005,A+++,4,"I have an 04 GTO instead of the 05 and I love it, definitely my favorite car, well worth trading my camaro Z28 for. I wish they would of had the LS2 in the 04."

pontiac,gto,2005,simon, 04/15/2005,not bad at all,4,"i bought the 2004 with incentives and im glad i did , very tightly built , smooth acceleration, love listening to that deep exhaust when just cruising at like 70 , you get to 70 so fast you dont even realize it.  if you want a real quick american v8for 34000 you cant beat it . not many cars faster  in this price range or less and the interior seats are flawless , you get macnine pedals , you get the whole race car feel and still room in the bac seat for 2 more people , yes unlike the mustang there is room there ."
pontiac,gto,2005,PR, 04/19/2005,2005 GTO,4,"When looking at new car options I didn't know much about the GTO. I had guessed it was something akin to a Grand Am with a big engine dropped in. Upon test driving it was immediately clear that my preconceptions were completely wrong. More like a BMW 330 with a huge engine...  No squeaks or rattles to speak of, tight fitting door and gaps, and of course neck-snapping performance (yes it's fast!).  The first car I've ever loved - and you won't know it unless you drive one."
pontiac,gto,2005,Robert Spinden, 04/29/2005,A white knuckle experience!,4,"This car is nothing but amazing!  With it's 400 horses under the hood waiting to go it deffinately has some ""get up and go.""  The best part about the car is nobody has one!  I've never seen on the road.  It's a sleeper, nobody knows what's under the hood.  People point at red lights and ask you about it at the gas station.  They recommend premium, so it can be a spendy trip!  My buddy had his 2005 GTO up to 156 mph and he said it was still climbing.  It handles great around the corners, and is truely a great ride!  Don't buy one!  So there are less GTO's out there for people to drool on!!!"
pontiac,gto,2005,Patrick Devenny, 04/30/2005,Goat,4,"The new GTO is a big improvement from the 04 model, the 05 has a 6.0 liter v8 at 400 horses, this car really flys. its one of the best on the road and theres not many cars that will keep up with it  "
pontiac,gto,2005,JYCSJDG, 05/01/2005,I love my gto,5,"I just drove my gto 3,000 miles to florida. Handling through the mountains was awesome, i felt i was in a nascar race, and best of all i got 19-23 mpg. The interior is so comfortable, no stiff legs at the rest area. I love my goat and even had alittle fun against the new mustang on international drive. Thanks pontiac ihad a 68 and always swore i'd by a new one if i could and thanks to you i did and i am lovin it. I also have lot's of pontiac drag racin friends and they could not believe how fast, how nice the engine compartment was (user friendly. And the quality of the workman ship. Though i have one downfall. Quick disconnect, lost one on the way home for trans line. They are gone now! "
pontiac,gto,2005,dmglobal, 05/01/2005,GTO rocks,4,"The 2005 Pontiac GTO is quite possibly the best built car ever offered by Pontiac--and a worthy successor to the GTO name. Its styling is understated yet aggressive, the fit and finish impeccable, and the performance shames sportscars twice the price. This 'stealth fighter' packs a 400- horsepower 6-litre V8 (the Corvette LS2 married to a Tremec 6-speed)that rockets it from zero to sixty MPH in four and a half seconds. A thoroughly satisfying drive that handles and brakes as well as any domestic and many European sports cars. It leaves Ferraris, BMWs, Mustangs and Porsche Boxsters standing still. The best part is surprising 'exotic' drivers who don't know what it is. The new GTO rocks!"
pontiac,gto,2005,Craig Lavin, 05/02/2005,2005 GTO Delivers,4,"  I've had quite a few ""Sports Cars"" and this new GTO would probably rate the best that I've owned.   It has the handling, power and ride of a true sports car, but it has the front seat comfort of a luxury car. The plush soft leather seating compares to my 87' Corvette, but I don't have to crawl into or out of it.   The biggest drawback is the $1400.00 GAS GUZZLER TAX. I average about 21 1/2 mpg's with my driving habits. I would also like to see abit more luxury items in the interior, more trunk space. And I would have jumped at a convertable if it was available. "
pontiac,gto,2005,H, 05/12/2005,GTO to Go,4,"I searched over 4 months for a new vehicle. Looking at Fords and Chevys. Heard bad reviews for the 2004 GTO. Waited for 2005 for improvements. Searched over a 100 mile radius to find the right dealership. Tested and enjoyed the performance. Same drivetrain as a corvette, for lower price plus it can hold two more people. Held out for the one color that would work. Cyclone Gray, which does not look like gray. Plus I wanted the Sport Appearance Package."
pontiac,gto,2005,Big Red, 05/29/2005,"Love it , but needs better fuel economy",4,"The GTO has more power than I'll ever need, and with a partial sports appearence package this one beautiful auto.  I'm 99% in love with the GTO with the 1% being poor gas mileage.  The EPA rates it at 17 city and 25 highway, but I've been averaging 11 all-around.  I have a 6 speed and have driving very moderately as I am still breaking the engine."
pontiac,gto,2005,cjvanho, 05/31/2005,GTO 2004,4,I found a few details in the body that seemed shoddy or badly painted. Aftermarket parts that were installed by Dealership really don't match paint from factory. The Mirrors have serious problems  they have blind spots and are not either big enough or they are placed wrong. The car has some HP however it's missing midrange torque.
pontiac,gto,2005,gtolvr, 06/08/2005,GTO Review,4,Interior is wrapped in enough leather to confuse you into thinking you're in a luxury vehicle not a muscle car.  Performance and handling are superb.  This is one of the best vehicles pontiac has every put out.
pontiac,gto,2005,jakedy, 06/09/2005,gto review,4,i love this car. its fast and handles well but lacks in the muscular look like the older gto.
pontiac,gto,2005,Tommy DeGrange, 06/13/2005,the truth,4,the car is a fun drive.  it couls use a little styling help for the 06 model year.  but as for the performance and handling the car meets all my expectations. all in all a good car.  has a small problem with tires (i wore off the factory tires in only 30k with very little burn out action)
pontiac,gto,2005,Chris, 06/29/2005,Beware of what Pontiac doesn't tell you!,3,"If you like Toyota/Nissan or Honda DO NOT buy this vehicle. I had 3 problems with my GTO at only 1300 mies. One and two were with the LSD/Differential making a whining noise, plus when you shift it occasionally, it will make a knocking sound. Three, had to do with the clutch sticking a lot. The LSD/Diff problem apparentally has been around since the Camaro/Firebird days and now affects the GTO too. To have those problems with it at only 1300 miles and for the LSD/Diff problem to have been around in GM for over 10 yrs. It just shows to me that GM has a very poor quality control program. The end result is, I will never buy an American car again."
pontiac,gto,2005,dburger66, 06/29/2005,Denny's 05' GTO,4,"I have had the car for a little under 2 months now and have had no major problems.  There is on fit/finish issue with the interior and the controls for the A/C seem really cheap for a car costing almost $35,000.  The only other complaint would be ingress/egress to the rear seats, once your back there it is really comfortable, the hard part is getting into the back to begin with.  Also, the power seats work great but they move REALLY slow.  Also a compass/temp display in the rearview mirror would be nice, I had an 03 Vue that had one and it cost $10,000. less than my GTO."
pontiac,gto,2005,Fraser Semple, 08/11/2005,The everyday practicle performance car,4,"Great vehicle, extremely comfortable to drive, 25mpg averaged on 300 mile trip and ran 13.00 seconds quarter mile."
pontiac,gto,2005,Daryl, 08/26/2005,Long Awaited GTO,5,"Sat in my first GTO in 1968 when I was 13 and for my 50th birthday my wife brought me a 2005 Cyclone Grey GTO and surprised me with it.  After 37 years I think the wait was worth it.  It's a great car, performs magnificently and puts ""muscle"" back into the car business.  A normally aspirated engine void of turbo chargers etc. it gets up and goes.  A true pleasure to own and drive.  With that said, wonder when someone is going to mess up and stop producing the GTO again!"
pontiac,gto,2005,MrMcCaff, 08/29/2005,Absolutely Impressive!!!,5,"From the second that i test drove my GTO at the dealership, I've been in love with it.  In the past two years, I've owned a 1998 Trans Am and a C5 Corvette and those are both great cars but I truly think that the overall package of the GTO is better.  The quality of the GTO is amazing, I feel like I'm riding in a high end BMW.  This car is the perfect combination of style and performance."
pontiac,gto,2005,JohnnyGTO, 08/31/2005,Awesome car!,4,"I've had my 2005 GTO for almost two months now and added on almost 6000 miles.  I have owned two Corvettes, Trans Am WS6, 2002 Camaro SS, and other American Muscle.  This car has, by far, been the best of the bunch.  The build quality isn't like any other GM car.  The car is extremely powerful, but has a lot of weight to tug around.  The styling could be a bit more aggressive but its a style you love after being around it and seeing it in person daily.  I certainly have plans for it... just need to wait for a Twin Screw for the GTO.  =)"
pontiac,gto,2005,Jess, 09/13/2005,GTO,5,"This is the best car I have ever owned. It is super fast but costs only a fraction of many other muscle cars (i.e.: Cobra Mustang, Corvette, Viper). The gas mileage isn't as bad as I had originally expected. This is a fun, fast, reliable car that you can easily get used for under $27k or new for under $35k."
pontiac,gto,2005,GTO by Ben, 09/23/2005,The best GTO ever !!!,5,"I had a 1966 and 1968 GTO from the same dealer I got my 2005 Midnight Blue GTO Can't believe the sound and power from the LS2 400hp engine.Very comfortable ride and did I mention the POWER. Great sounding radio system,love the six-disc cd changer. I agree that it looks so much better in person."
pontiac,gto,2005,Delton, 11/08/2005,GTO the way to go.,5,I have had this GTO for about 7 months and I drive it daily. It is still a joy to drive. I can't say that for a lot of vehicles I bought that became stale afterwards. 
pontiac,gto,2005,David Kulha, 11/08/2005,05 GTO review,4,"This is the best performance car that I have ever owned for under 30k. Gut wrenching acceleration, great handling, good stereo, comfortable interior, quiet on the highway. An A+ for GM."
pontiac,gto,2005,Bill Ziebarth, 12/10/2005,One Great Automobile - Is it really a GM??,4,"Before I picked-up the car, I thought it would be great.  After I drove it for just a 100 miles I knew it was great! It gives the ""off the line"" performance of a 1963 Chevy ""409"".  The handling as good or better than a 1969 Camaro Z28 . And top-end speed that leaves you breathless.  I have had trouble with General Motors cars that were built for only those that are beyond middle age. This one is Not.  I drove back to Seattle vis Idaho, Nevada, California, & Oregon.  The GTO got an average of 24.7 miles to the gallon.  Now, that pretty good for a car with 400 HP and the air-conditioning on the entire way. The GTO's interior is just a work of art, all in all its better than a 10"
pontiac,gto,2005,bluegto, 01/08/2006,Blue GTO,4,This car is by far the best bang for your buck. It has a screaming 400 horse power V8 thats dripping in raw power. It has all the luxuries of a modern sports car with the feel and power of an old school muscle car. This is by far one of the best modern day muscle cars on the market.
pontiac,gto,2005,GRF, 02/07/2006,Awesome,5,"This is the best car I've ever owned.  I sold my BMW 330i to get this car with no regrets.  It's better than an M3.  The quality of the interior, the power, handling (with some minor upgrades), and the ability to carry 4 adults in comfort.  I've put 20K miles on my car in the last year.  I still get over 23 mpg on the highway and put down over 440 HP at the rear wheels (with a few small mods).  Plus, you don't see yourself at every stoplight unlike some other ""performance"" cars."
pontiac,gto,2005,bluebyu05, 03/08/2006,best performance car forthe money,5,"i've had my gto since july 05 and drive it on weekends and every time i take it out i get more and more impressed with the performance , handling and comfort. it's basically a corvette that you can fit 4 people in comfortably . not to mention with the amount of hp 400 the gas miles is better than the mustang which has 300hp. its really a fun car to drive."
pontiac,gto,2005,Shane's Silver GTO, 03/10/2006,Perfect to Me,4,I only want to say that I am 100% satisfied with my 2005 GTO 6.0 liter. I drove alot of performance cars but always came right back to the GTO. Many don't care for it and that's fine. Everyone is entitled to say what they want. I just plan LOVE my GTO.
pontiac,gto,2005,BCWatty, 03/14/2006,4 passenger corvette,4,"I am a car-a-holic, my last 4 were a Lexus, MINI, M-B, and BMW.  Always valued handling over horsepower - I never knew what I was missing.  Not sure if I can go back.  I was glad to find a GM product with some appeal; unfortunately, the lower portion of my rear bumper keeps falling off and dealer states this design defect is not covered under warranty (a unique strategy, car falls apart, blame the customer) cannot imagine being treated this way at Lexus dealership.  Car is never fixed the first time and the wait for parts is in terms of months, not weeks or days.  Cool car, but not very stylish when the bumper spends more time in my trunk than on the vehicle.  There is no viable alternative."
pontiac,gto,2005,Steve, 04/19/2006,Life with a Goat...,4,"Got my GTO (6-spd) in June 2005 and enjoy it. It's a comfortable hiway car with a decent ride and maybe the best bucket seats I've found in an American car. Hiway gas mileage is pretty good (25 mpg for me) for a big coupe with a 6.0L V8. In town, it's a hog (12-14 mpg for me), and the ride is more brittle on rough pavement or in City driving. Acceleration is phenomenal, and braking is good for such a heavy car. Handling is acceptable given that this is a 3,800 pd coupe, not a tossabout roadster. Mechanically, the ""weakest link"" is an awful shifter for the 6- spd, gated way too wide and with a rubbery feel. Conclusion: Go fast in comfort, don't worry too much about gas mileage, & have fun!"
pontiac,gto,2005,john deleone, 05/22/2006,gto,4,"I have had this car for one year. no problems at all,, hiway mileage is around 25 MPG and city about 17,it is fun to drive and draws attention everywhere I go"
pontiac,gto,2005,glenn cummings, 06/03/2006,pontiac GTO is great,4,"this car is the best car i have ever owned to this point. i am 67 years old but i still have my passion for cars and performance. in high school when everybody was driving fords and chevys i drove a 1950 olds ""88"". i have always driven performance cars be they two doors, four doors or pickups. in my opinion the GTO is the best i have owned or driven ever."
pontiac,gto,2005,Tom, 06/07/2006,The beauty is also a beast,4,"My is a 2005, 6 speed w/18"" wheel package. I've owned 80+ cars and yes one of the orininal GTOs (1970 Ram Air III 4 speed) as well as Corvettes, Trans Ams, Z28s & etc... I am very impressed with the new leftover 2005 GTO that I purchased in March. The car is great, powerful, soild, great handling and brakes. I've driven a 2005 Mustang GT 5 speed and was disappointed with the Mustang. The GTO is hands down a better car overall. It does come up short of the Mustang in two areas: #1. Exterior Styling is not quite on the mark. #2. the front seats are not as comfortible as the 05 Mustang GT's are. The lower seat cushion hits me in the back of my leg and feel akward when depressing the clutch."
pontiac,gto,2005,05' gto, 07/01/2006,05' gto,4,"love the car , definitely a wolf in sheeps clothing , the power is strong from idle to 6500 rpm. gm should take note of the superior interior quality of this car. would recommend a better shifter, and a little stiffer suspension, power lock button on console, and homelink. otherwise a 10"
pontiac,gto,2005,Roger, 07/04/2006,2005 GTO,4,The most enjoyable car I've ever owned.  I had muscle cars in the 60's but this is a far stronger machine with the LS2 and 6 speed.  I like the fact that the new GTO is rare - not many around (GM probably doesn't think this is a positive).  All that and reasonable gas mileage to boot.
pontiac,gto,2005,challenger340, 07/21/2006,performance bargain,4,"Purchased my 05 Quicksilver GTO in May 2006 with 3200 miles for $25,000.  I am really, really pleased with the performance, handling and comfort of this Austailian/Chevrolet/Pontiac automobile and am convinced that a car with similar qualites from Mercedes or BMW or Nissan (M45) or Chevtolet (Corvette or SSR)would cost upwards of $45,000.00 - $60,000.00. I belive that it compares very favorably with the SRT- 8 Charger and 300C SRT-8 which cost arouind $ 10,000 more and can out perform some even more expensove cars. It's a pretty unique and rare vehicle that not many people know about or want but in summary, to drive one is to have to buy one, buy one before they're all gone, trust me.        "
pontiac,gto,2005,PeterGTO, 01/26/2005,"Dont delay, get yours today!",5,"After years of driving compact cars or full size automatics, this GTO is a thing of beauty.  Absolutely a blast to drive.  The 6-speed shifter takes a little getting used to if you have never driven one before but other than the heavy clutch, it is very easy to drive even in rush-hour traffic.  If you can afford one, get it!  Only 12000 scheduled for 2005 model year."
pontiac,gto,2005,GTO '05 , 01/25/2005,Explosive GTO !!!,4,"Since I purchased the car I look forward to driving the GTO on a daily basis. The vehicle has awsome torque on the take off, and pass ability. I have the six speed manual, the gears shift smooth and compact. Handling is above average holds very tight on curves, yet comfortable on long trips. Stability could be a little better.  "
pontiac,gto,2005,Goldenrod, 02/08/2005,WOW,4,"Waited for the 6.0. well worth the wait.Looks better than the 04'. I sell GM products. Compared to vette both great cars but for the money I preferred the GTO, 4 seats smoother ride.Very powerful car with great handling. Australian car with american Drive Train works very well.The only complaint I have is that the Key is too big. You Gotta Drive One!!!!!"
pontiac,gto,2005,Speedy, 02/19/2005,Fun,4,This car is fun to drive. Sharp handling in the corners. The car has an aggressive exterior and very comfortable back seats.

Getting a child into the back is not the greatest but hey, it's not a family car!! The car makes the trouble worth it!! No issues yet. Interior is awesome!!"
pontiac,gto,2005,tahvette, 03/06/2005,The GTO returns,4,"Being of the age, that experienced the original muscle cars, I had to look into the GTO. In the market for a new car, but not willing to shell out for the mega-buck C6 Corvette, I test drove the 05 GTO. Not quite refined as the vette, it is still a blast to drive. Handles well, very comfortable and is very fast. Very fast. It is a real kick to blow away the boy-racers, but still take my wife to dinner in a very civilized car. Love it!"
pontiac,gto,2005,SULLIVAN, 03/08/2005,Pros Only Need Apply,4,"I used to race a 1968 GTO on the track (pure stock). That WAS one of the biggest thrills of my life. I now have a much bigger thrill. I didn't think this much power could be legal under $35,000.The comfort and appointments were a pleasant surprise too!"
pontiac,gto,2005,Dave, 03/08/2005,Fun in 2k5,4,"The 2005 GTO has finally started to take note of the people hollering about appearance items.  I really like the scoops and the split tail pipes.  A lot of what they did to the 2005 was available on the 2004 model but as dealer installed options making the cost go up greatly.  This year they added these as standard.  There are still some dealer available options that really dress up the car, these should be looked into for the fun loving GTO freak in all of us."
pontiac,gto,2005,All Performance, 03/07/2005,All Performance,4,"If you pull up to this car at a red light don't be fooled, it's gonna blow your doors off. Best performance car you can get for under 35,000. New 6.0 has that extra feel good punch. Fixed the exterior a little in 2005 with ram air hood and true dual exhuast. Great handling. Smooth ride for a coupe with a sport suspension."
pontiac,gto,2005,mdavis, 03/13/2005,A Sleeper,4,"I love it!  Where else can you get a quality fit and finish, 0-60 times in the mid 4 second range, 400HP, 25 mpg, independent suspension, quality leather seats and pay less than 33K?  This car rivals the best of the imports minus perhaps some of the trendy gadgets that have little to do with driving, and will run away from any of them priced under 50K."
pontiac,gto,2005,Brian, 03/15/2005,MY 2005 GTO,4,"By chance, visiting my wife's family in Marion, Va. I spotted this Impluse Blue '05 GTO, sitting at the front of the lot at an auto store .. I walked over and bought the GTO on the spot (without even a test drive) & drove the GTO back to our home in Horse Shoe, NC.  It now has 1385 of the most enjoyable miles I have ever put on a vehicle.  Wife & I love this car! NO I am not having a midlife crisis and YES, I do remember the GTO's of the 60's / 70's.. but, the NEW GTO has them beat--performance, ride quality, & comfort. "
pontiac,gto,2005,fitty, 03/19/2005,GTO is AWESOME!,4,I was in the market for a new Mustang but could never find a black on black and all of the dealerships I went to were very unfriendly.  I then decided to pursue a corvette and ran into the same problem so I got online and searched many different sports cars from $30k-$50 and found that my GTO was the best buy for the performance.  $34k is not a bad price for a 400 horse power car.
pontiac,gto,2005,Tracy, 03/22/2005,Awesome Car,5,"I was always a big fan of the Mustang until I drove this car. What a dream and it looks really nice to. I have heard the comment, ""It looks better in person."" So if you haven't gone to see it or test drive it, it is an absolute must.  Great handling, pickup is DEFINITELY there when you need it. I wouldn't trade it for a Mustang ever.  I absolutely love this car."
pontiac,gto,2005,Paul, 04/02/2005,They got it right this time!,4,"Great fun to drive.  If you don't need all the cushy stuff and just want the muscle, you can't go wrong with the GTO.  Be ready to pay lots more for comparable performance from other makes.  Plenty of power and handles superbly.  I traded an '04 for an '05.  Hood scoops and rear-end redesign is a great style improvement over the '04.  More powerful engine and much improved brakes make this one better live up to the GTO name.  Minor problems with shifter sticking or not catching (in reverse).  Idle pulley seized within the first 30 miles.  Accelerator sensor malfunction at 300 miles.  Electronic throttle takes some getting used to.  Parts still not readily available for repairs."
pontiac,gto,2005,Arch, 04/01/2005,2005 GTO (a tiger in goat's skin),4,"2005 GTO automatic in Cyclone Gray. A very nice car, nice cool interior and very comfortable.  Holden did such a wonderful job on the interior, and it is quite obvious this is no ordinary GM car. Though I love the Mustang's outer skin, it's the Goat's interior and performance that have me hooked. For all those who cry ""import"".  So what! Last generation F bodies were built in Canada and they kicked the Mustang's rear all over the place for approx 10 yrs.  The GTO automatic will stomp a Mustang GT big time.  Anyway, the exterior could have used better styling or freshening.  Ram Air would have been nice, but this car has so much power it doesn't really need."
pontiac,gto,2005,peterpoway, 05/09/2005,2005 GTO,4,"I just bought a 2005 GTO and have had it for about a week and it is great.  I had a 1994 Z28 6spd. before this, and the GTO is more refined and considerably more powerful.  This car is fun to drive, sold and begs to be flogged."
pontiac,gto,2005,speedy goat, 05/08/2005,Love this car,4,"This car is incredible! For the money that I spent; the performance, build quality, and interior amenities - WOW.  This is NOT a replacement for the old F Bodies. This is what they should have been. I would definitely recommend this car."
pontiac,gto,2005,GoatFink, 05/24/2005,"Solid Car, Well Built, Excellent Quality",4,"Fast, fun to drive, nice comfy interior and still outsmokes a Mustang GT with 1 or 4 occupants. 0-60 is at 4.6 seconds and you won't find that in a Mustang in 2005. It's unique, not many on the road and looks like a Euro sports car rather than an American Boy racer machine. It is not an embarassing car to drive that requires striping, etc to be arrogant or flamboyant and the engine roars just to let you know who is boss."
pontiac,gto,2005,kc, 05/24/2005,My Gto,4,"I absolutely love this car. The exterior design grows on you, and the interior is beautiful. Drive this car after you drive any mustang, and you will beg for the extra 5 grand you need to buy it. What a value, a 400 hp crovette engine, in a sleeper 4 person coupe for just over 30 grand... or just under if you play your cards right!"
pontiac,gto,2005,Lahrma M, 06/03/2005,Thats mr. Goat to you,4,"GREAT CAR!!! way too much fun for one share the love with the roomy bakseat you won't find in an 05'stang. Nice clean refreshing design, no need for tack- ons with 400hp power at your disposal. In short-drive it, youll love it, end of story. If ya don't ya don't."
pontiac,gto,2005,Nick, 06/07/2005,Pure American Muscle w/ a Plush Interior,5,"If you are looking for a car with great performance and a reasonable price tag, look no further. The 2005 GTO is nicely equipped with an LS2 400hp engine, and a very ""plush"" interior. It has the best of both worlds, Performance and Comfort.  ...And the truth is that the GTO's naturally aspirated engine will smoke an 05' GT and keep up with an 04' Mustang Cobra! "
pontiac,gto,2005,TALL PAUL, 06/18/2005,Wow,4,"Not since my 1968 GTO & 1970 muscle cars has driving an affordably priced vehicle been so much fun. Only enhancement wish would be if it were available as a convertible. Stereo speakers/amplifiers could use an upgrade but otherwise this car is so comfortable, even for a tall & big guy that the only other dream wish would be to drive my new ""muscle car"" on Germany's Autoban. "
pontiac,gto,2005,pwrdbypntiac, 06/29/2005,Great GTO,4,"The 2005 GTO is a great car.  I work for GM so I fully looked over the car before hand.  The panel to panel fit and paint are excellent, no squeaks and rattles, or wind noise.  Very beautiful interior with a handsome understated exterior.  I get complimenets and many people asking me about this car wherever I go.  Today a guy with an old GTO complimented me on my GTO...then i smoked him"
pontiac,gto,2005,scott fuller, 06/30/2005,A classic already,4,"This car is amazing. It is fast, easy to drive, handles great and looks terrific. Lets hope GM keeps the GTO as long as it is worthy of the name. Too often it kills off cars too soon and never allows any brand or model loyalty to develop. This is one car that lives up to its name. It is a true classic right now. Great value for the money. Six speeds, true dual exhausts, classic sound, neck snapping acceleration. I love it !"
pontiac,gto,2005,Robgotone, 07/02/2005,new toy,4,"Wow, what a blast to drive. This car gave me a midlife crisis at 33! It's quick and handles great. Im sure the fit and finish is less than the Benz i traded but the benz will see nothing but tail lights! Who said you have to grow up? Bring on the young punks in their tuner's! IM waiting!!!!"
pontiac,gto,2005,Bryan, 07/13/2005,Nothing else like it,5,"For the price I paid just under $30,000 there is no other car like it. Better interior and seats than a Dodge Charger and Mustang GTO. Faster than both those cars and may be as fast or faster then my 2000 corvette. But still holds two 6.0 foot adults in the back seat unlike the 2005 mustang. Great car for traveling long distances."
pontiac,gto,2005,DAM, 07/20/2005,Awesome!,4,"This is just an all around amazing car.  As much power as any ordinary driver would need.  The interior is extremely comfortable and there really IS room for 2 adults in the back, though getting back is the difficult part.  I gave fuel economy less than 10 simply because I haven't been able to reach the numbers advertised (perhaps totally my fault). But you don't buy this car looking for fuel economy.  Oh and Boo automatic, Yay 6-speed."
pontiac,gto,2005,Carlos, 07/20/2005,Fun & Fast,4,"I love to drive this vehicle.  It has plenty of torque at any speed.  Some people complain about the look, but I love it.  I test drove the Dodge Charger, the Toyota Avalon, and the BMW 645.  The Avalon's acceleration compared to the GTO is like comparing a bycicle to a motorcycle.  The Avalon feels sluggish.  The BMW has excellent handling, better than the GTO, but performance-wise it is not a stand- out.  The Charger is pretty quick and has more room, but it is not nearly as much fun to drive as the GTO (or as quick).  Bottom line: I love my GTO."
pontiac,gto,2005,CharlieJ, 07/28/2005,Great Vehicle,5,An outstanding review.  Handles nicely and very comfortable to be in.  I take it everywhere.  Puts the Mustang GT to shame.
pontiac,gto,2005,Dave McCloskey, 07/29/2005,GTO - Outstanding value & performance,4,"The press has hammered the GTO design from day one. Personally I don't think they get it. In my opinion the GTO exudes American muscle and the same time has an understated Euro look that will hold its visual appeal well into the future. The fact the car is made by Holden in Australia only adds to its value and appeal.  The GTO's fit and finish is far better than its American competitors (Mustang GT, Charger) and is equal to Japanese sports coupes I have driven in this price range. Performance on the other hand is no contest. This car will get it done!  "
pontiac,gto,2005,GTO-O4 from AJ-2, 07/30/2005,GTO-O4 from AJ-2,4,"Nothing like doing a 30 mph corner at 80. Had the 1st '64 GTO in Albany. 13 trophies at Glensfalls. Now have the 1st GTO in Littleton. So much more car! GM charcoal grey hood scoops and a black/red/black side accent stripe sets this yellow car off. Did not want yellow, but love it now. I'm getting close to 20 mpg and still having fun.  Got 26 on a trip using all the economy tricks with the Tremec and engine rpm.  But too much fun to drive.  The Aussie's know how to build a car. Tight and stable. At 62, I would like to try the 1/4 with it in stock dress to see if I can better my '64 times.  Anyway, a great road car."
pontiac,gto,2005,75bluejs, 07/30/2005,Best car I've owned,4,"For those who are looking for world class speed without paying the exotic price, then look no further. It's just amazing that GM put a 400hp Corvette engine in this vehicle and is selling it for under 35K.  Interior, and overall build quality is the best I've seen in a GM vehicle.  It even seats four adults in great comfort!"
pontiac,gto,2005,Brien Levy, 07/29/2005,The new and improved Pontiac GTO,4,"For some reason, the new GTO has been ignored by the reigning car magazines but they're missing a great machine for performance comparisons. The main complaint is the exterior styling when compared to the new Mustang GT. A point missed is that Mustang sells a ton of smaller engined units that look like the GT so owners see themselves coming and going. The GTO doesn't look like a kid's hot rod but it runs like one and its handling is far superior. Its ride and comfort befit a high-end sedan. So, if like me, you were a teenager when the first GTO hit the streets but you'd now feel silly driving a teenager's car, consider the '05 version. You'll get all the storm and fury and feel pretty cool."
pontiac,gto,2005,Rob, 07/29/2005,Awesome Car,4,This car is totally awesome!!  The power and handle are the main points for this true muscle car.  I've tested this car at high and low speeds and have not been disappointed at either end.
pontiac,gto,2005,mosquito2376, 07/29/2005,"The best ""Mother's Day"" present ever!",4,"I traded in my 1994 GMC Safari, for this beautiful machine during Mother's Day weekend this May.  I love its acceleration, handling and sound.  The interior is comfortable, my kids can actually look out the side windows and not just see a ""seat"" in front of them as they do when they ride in my husband's 1998 Z28 Camaro.  Buy a 6 speed, I test drove a used 2004 with an automatic and it just made me hungry for more.  What a beautiful classy car that definately can compete with the BMW's and Mercedes' on the road today.  ""Sleeper"" is the best word to describe this car, I've had many a young fellow pull up thinking they had the ""guts"" to beat me and I left them in the dust everytime.  "
pontiac,gto,2005,Chrono Avenger, 08/05/2005,Better then you think.,4,"My last driver was a 2002 BMW M3. Is this car as good, NO. But it is 95% as good for 55%(price I paid). This car is the most fun to drive that $32,000 will buy. Handling is about 85% of the M3, but that BMW is the best right?? The ride is better then the M3 and the fit is almost as good. The seats are the best of any GM car. This is a classic GT car, big, heavy, and very fast. If your think that heaven is going around little cones in a parking lot this is not you car. If you like going for one state to the next in comfort, on real roads, not race tracks, in record times (432 mi. in 4hrs and 36mins.) under the radar. This is your car.   "
pontiac,gto,2005,GaryL, 08/04/2005,Sharp!,4,Just picked up this 05 after test driving an 04. Impressive power and comfort all in one package. Exterior looks make it a deceptive speed predator at the traffic lights. Seat slowness does stink but not a big deal when all else adds up to an awesome vehicle build. Blue on Blue is a very sharp look for this vehicle. Looking forward to aftermarket tools for this great mid-life crisis requirement.
pontiac,gto,2005,George Smallfield, 08/07/2005,Happy with mine,4,"I purchased my GTO instead of a Infiniti G35 coupe after driving both.  8K miles later I can't imaging how wrong the G35 would have been, my GTO seats 4 comfortably (granted getting in the back seats is difficult, but comfy once you're there), is MUCH faster, more comfortable ride and saved me some money.

pontiac,gto,2005,scott hall, 08/10/2005,Biggest Bang for Your Buck,4,This is one of the fastest cars i have ever drove. It rides and handles like a dream. The is only for drivers that have been driving for a while not for a teenager. It has plenty of room front and back and the back seat is very comfy...so give the GTO a drive..and you will buy it...and make sure you drive the 6-speed :o)

YOU WILL be impressed! I'm a former Porsche owner (Both 911 and 928S4 so you know I'm spoiled!) and I am throughly impressed with my 2005 ""Yellow Jacket"" M6 GTO.

Wonderful sport seat with high quality gorgeous red leather. I specially like the plain Jane look housing the lion under the hood. Even though I am not too fond of the hood scoops, but who wouldn't welcome more direct fresh air flow to the engine. It gets better MPG than many V-6 out there. Fall in love with this car in one quick drive. Driving slow in this car is a life long skill to master. Don't be a cop magnet !!!"

pontiac,gto,2005,Rick Jenkins, 09/06/2005,Australian GTO,4,"One of the best value for money deals out there. The Pontiac nose detracts from the look of the car when compared to the original supplied by Holden on the Monaro, but all in all a beautiful car that looks significantly better in the skin than in any photo. Brilliant power and terrific handling if you like to take your corners faster than the posted speed. Great brakes, decent shift quality from the 6 speed box. A little heavy at 3700 lbs or so, but that's the price you pay for the creature comforts that come standard with this car.  All in all, a great overall package. "

pontiac,gto,2005,Manimal, 10/16/2005,Incredible Car!,5,"This car is a sleeper Mustang killer!  Couldn't be happier with the 05 GTO!  Every time I pass a Mustang (which is pretty much all the time) I can't help but smile.  Mostly because my car simply powers by, but also because you don't see GTO's at every corner.  I don't want to mod my car to separate it from the others (just search for Mustang mods and see how many returns you get).  Sometimes subtle understated makes more of a statement.  Loving my GTO!"
pontiac,gto,2005,cyclops24, 10/18/2005,Lemon,3,"I love my GTO. Unfortunately I got a lemon. Leaking head gasket, fuel injector wiring harness failure, numerous exhaust leaks and my biggest issue, paint flaws through and etching. I have been without my car for a total of 52 days in less than one years time. Currently in the process of lemon law. "
pontiac,gto,2005,Gary Hooper, 11/01/2005,A Collectors Item,4,I have one of the last Monaros (Pontiac GTO) to be sold in Australia. I am disappointed that this car will no longer be produced in this country  as its build quality and muscle car character make it the equal of many cars costing considerably more. I'll save it for my grandchildren so they can appreciate what it was like to drive a car with more than 2 cylinders!
pontiac,gto,2005,Heywood Wakefield, 11/02/2005,Contented Old Man,4,"I've had this 6-speed GTO for only about 600 miles.  So far, it is just great.  It handles well and accelerates well. The stick shift, while not totally sporty, is fine.  Car feels solid.  I bought this car because it is beautiful looking to me (it has a quietly strong appearance) and because I did want to get the most power for the money.  It being 60% Australian and 90's-looking were not an issue  for me.  Yes, the trunk is small, the power seats are slow-moving, rear entry is difficult, and this is no mileage king.  What the GTO is: a pleasure to drive, a great car for my 60th birthday, and something very special.  This car puts a smile on my face.  I love to drive again!"
pontiac,gto,2005,Clyde Harris, 11/13/2005,"Now you see me, Now you Don't!!",4,"I did some research before buying this car. I wanted something fast but inexpensive, normally that is an oxymoron when it comes to cars. My prayers were answered when I saw the GTO, I cannot say anything negative about this car at this time. I am truly happy with my purchase. the torque/horsepower is definitely ""head pinned to the back of the seat"" Fast!!! I am 6ft 2 in and weigh 220 lbs and this car is still roomy, not the comfort of my Expedition, but I have traveled over 300 miles and the ride was nice. I can't wait to add mods."

pontiac,gto,2005,PJNLS2, 11/29/2005,a true sleeper muscle car,4,All I can say is go test drive one and you will know all there is to know. Don't be afraid to get on it when test driving. This car dominates the road. I love when the imports pull up on what they think is some regular everyday car only to see the tail lights disappear into the night!!
pontiac,gto,2005,Mike, 12/01/2005,2005 GTO,4,"The GTO is a fun car to drive. It is an everyday car with a very comfortable interior design. With the 6.0, you do not lack performance."
pontiac,gto,2005,dkrii, 12/02/2005,Great Car,4,"It doesn't look perfect, but I love the car. Put together really well, and very fast. Best car I have ever owned. I bought it as a weekend car, but I can't not drive it. It is my daily driver now. I will never sell this car."
pontiac,gto,2005,daniel, 01/11/2006,Buy it!!!!!!,4,"I get lots of complements on the road.""Nice goat"" shouted one kid. Another time, a Mustang GT pulled up and the driver asked me what kind of exhaust I had. When I told him it was stock he said ""don't change it, it sounds awsome"". I'm always getting thumbs up and people checking it out with a big grin on their face.   "
pontiac,gto,2005,Lynn F1, 01/12/2006,suits me!,4,"Have owned this car for two months and about 750 miles.  it's very well put together, fast, and comfortable.  stereo's good.  dash and radio customizations are nice."
pontiac,gto,2005,Acosta, 01/27/2006,GTO rules,4,"I love the sound of the motor at start up, crusing on FL turpike, Racing it at the track in Gainsville FL against imports espicialy The STi, I always seam to beat them, unlike your fake review ""STi vs GTO"" I have guys in Miami FL pulling me over with STi's to ask me about my GTO, one guy even traded his STi for a silver GTO 05. I love everything about it."

pontiac,gto,2005,ChevySmallBlock=HP, 03/03/2006,Great Car - NOT Dime-a-Dozen,4,"More horsepower easily accessible without SC. A ton of performance parts available for small block Chevy motors. I love the sound of this car, especially when launching or serious downshifting. This motor is HIGH quality and will take what it was made for."
pontiac,gto,2005,bfargin, 04/04/2006,GTO exceeds the mark,4,"Well, after owning this fine automobile for several months I thought I would share my feelings.  Wow, what a car.  The build quality is excellent, it feels more like a european luxury car than a typical GM econobox.  I realize it costs close to 30K but I still think you are getting tons of quality for the money.  I like the interior better than I like the new MB E350 or CLK350. Handling is great for the size and weight involved.  After all it is a performance luxury coupe and not a bareboned racecar and yet still puts up great skidpad numbers. For the money you won't find better performance in a new car.  For right at 30K dollars you get a 400 hp engine that will pin you to the seat back."
pontiac,gto,2005,DBrian, 04/15/2006,Dave's comments,5,"My 05 gto is a great car, light years ahead of my vintage muscle cars. Also a good perfomance value with muscle and acceptable mileage."
pontiac,gto,2005,doug, 10/26/2006,05 GTO 18 in wheels 6 speed stock,5,reviews forget to add the 18 in wheel options with high performance tires. and the larger PBR brakes on the 05s. I have not seen a magazine review that actually tests one with the higher performance tires/wheels which is certain to improve handling!! Get one before they are gone. The design is a sleeper and mercedes like styling to be a later classic.

pontiac,gto,2005,farmerboy0707, 02/27/2007,05 GTO,4,Awesome vehicle. I normally lean towards trucks but this is one nice car to drive. has the HP and torque you need whenever. Fuel economy is good also. 
pontiac,gto,2005,jarred, 04/04/2007,Sweet Car,4,This car is the most fun I've ever had on 4 wheels. I love speed and this car delivers. It has plenty of power and I think it handles great for the size and weight of the vehicle. My friends all love it as well. I recommend this car to anyone who loves raw horsepower.
pontiac,gto,2005,PBMGTOM6, 05/30/2007,I will never let it go,5,"As the title reads, this vehicle will be with me as long as it runs. Sleeper look with raw power. I get pure respect everywhere I go from people who know what this car is. The ones who don't know and test me, soon find out as they fade in my rear view mirror. The interior is amazing, best in its class. It's rare to find a performance vehicle with a nice interior. Very comfy seats with a high quality look and feel. The GTO is a sheer thrill to drive. Beware: If you drive one, you will buy one! Very rare car and hardly see any driving around. Get one while you still can! "
pontiac,gto,2005,Firstinlastout, 06/17/2007,Performance bargain,4,"I've had my GTO for 10 months now. Super reliable, not a problem at all. I do a lot of driving with it and have taken it all the way up to the mountains of North Carolina from Miami and back. Not one issue except for a burned out brake light. The power is amazing. The suspension is taught and sporty but not as razor like as I would like. The trade-off though is a super comfortable ride. If GM could have put some bigger anti-sway bars and stiffened up the springs/shocks/struts just a tad bit...I would be in heaven. Overall, I am very impressed with the GTO inside and out. Sound system is a little weak and there are no dedicated doorlock buttons, but overall I love this car !"
pontiac,gto,2005,Ken, 09/29/2007,Best Car I have owned,4,"If you're looking for a car that is fun to drive and you're not concerned about gas mileage, then you're looking at the best car out there. You're looking at a 400hp ls2 that comes with the Corvette in half the price. I love it and with only a limited amount built, grab them while you can!"
pontiac,gto,2005,bobs, 07/31/2007,Only two problems,4,Great car with enormous power and spectacular performance.  Can not use tire chains which limits skiing trips. Gasoline mileage is poor but about what expected for a 6 liter high performance engine. Seats are extremely comfortable and interior noise very low at highway speed. Good sound system.  Wish it had exterior temperature indicator and mp3 input jack.
pontiac,gto,2005,Mike, 10/14/2007,Fantastic,4,"Bought this used '05 with appx. 17,000 miles on it, great value for the package.  Almost too fast!  Have enjoyed every minute. I drive a company vehicle to work, and I can wait to get home to get back to this beast. May not be the best representation of the old goats, but that doesn't mean that it is not a superb muscle car."
pontiac,gto,2005,Ron, 12/04/2007,I love my goat,4,"I was in the market for a G35 initially, but the performance, style & relative rarity of the GTO was a combination that was hard to beat.  I have the red on red M6 with chopped mufflers. I can't tell you how many compliments on the car I have gotten. She's great on long trips as well."
pontiac,gto,2005,05 GOAT, 03/28/2008,05 GOAT,4,"I remember getting a sneak peek at the ""new"" 1964 GTO back in the fall of 1963 at the local Pontiac Dealer with my dad.  That was thrilling as a 12 year kid. The car was kind of plain but the first thing the dealer talked about was the ""389"" motor.  This 2005 makes me think back to that experience the car, while attractive enough, does not get by on its looks ... its that 6.0 liter 400 HP engine.   Having owned many cars from early Z-28 (1968), Corvette, 400 CI Firebird, Tuubo-Coupe Thunderbird, three 5.0 Mustangs (still have 2), that are considered performance cars this may be the best balance.   Bought as a GM Certified Used car so far so good. I'm over 6'4"" & car is roomy for 2 adults."
pontiac,gto,2005,papacon60, 12/09/2007,Pro charged GTO,4,"Since I bought my GTO, I only drive it on nice days. This car has never seen a raindrop! I put on a pro-charger, 3"" stainless exhaust, a GMM rip-shifter, and drag-bags to eliminate wheel hop. The car was dyno tested, and produces 512 rear wheel h.p. The only comments I have about my GTO, is that is is scary fast, and an absolute blast to drive.Not to mention, the fastest car on the street!"
pontiac,gto,2005,Phantom Black Goat, 04/06/2008,Excellent Performance Coupe!,4,"Excellent Performance Coupe! I had a Trans Am before I got my GTO. The GTO is superior in every way. Performance is top notch, handling is great, ride quality is excellent. Interior trim and design is probably the best GM has ever done. Downsides are very minor, one does not expect fuel economy from a car of this type, however my fuel economy has not been as bad as I had feared. I get around 19 to 21 in a mix of city/highway. That is good for a car with a large V8 and 400 bhp. My personal experience has been wonderful with my GTO and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking into a high-performance coupe."
pontiac,gto,2005,2005 GTO, 04/28/2008,What a Blast!,4,"I was very happy when GM decided to manufacture another modern day Muscle Car.  I had a 68 Impala with a 427 when I was in High School, so when the 05 GTO came out with the 400 HP 6.0 I had to have one. This is the second car I've owned that makes me smile the minute I turn the key.  The big 6.0 V8 jumps to life and the low rumble of the dual exhaust starts your adrenaline flowing.  The rest is just pure excitement, amazing acceleration, the sound of that V8 and the brakes reel it in with confidence. The car is also quite rare, you only see a few GTOs a year. I am averaging 20 MPG even with a heavy right foot. So if you have a chance to test drive one, do it, you'll buy it."
pontiac,gto,2005,Brien, 05/23/2008,Missed Opportunity,4,"If you like American muscle combined with sophisticated styling and handling, you should have purchased a new GTO. I've had my manual six-speed for three years now and it's been everything I'd hoped. A bonus has been that I don't pass myself coming and going. The car is so rare that people often tell me mine is the first GTO they've seen. It's been trouble free and it's a kick to drive. I wouldn't sell mine but if you can find a used one, I recommend putting yourself in the driver's seat."
pontiac,gto,2005,Goat-a-roo, 05/28/2008,A reliable Muscle Car built to last,4,"I've had my Goat (or ROO since it was built in Australia!) for 20 months now. In that time I have put 40,000 miles on it. (I know! It's a LOT but I'm in sales & I like to travel). It's amazingly easy to rack on miles in this car because it is SO much fun to drive! The car is built SO STRONG!! Not a single rattle or anything at 53K. And she kicks the tires just as she did the day I brought 'er home. It is important to note that the reliability of the GTO is fantastic. I have had ZERO[0] problems. It always starts even in the coldest of winter. I can't recommend this car enough. Pure muscle & torque. And I average 25 MPG on the highway in a muscle car!!!! (long trips). Dead serious!"
pontiac,gto,2005,BPL, 08/06/2019,Fourteen and a half years down the road,5,"I've owned my 2005 GTO since new and have put 52,000 miles on it. The sole problem I've had is a leaking clutch slave cylinder. It's always been garaged and rarely driven in bad weather so I've had no problems with the interior leather or exterior paint. The car still looks new. I still enjoy driving it as much as I did the first time I got in it. If you can find a low mileage example that's been well cared for, I recommend buying it.

pontiac,gto,2006,Tom Miller, 02/06/2010,Refined Muscle Car Defined (2006 GTO),5,"Love my '06 GTO.  Truly a refined modern muscle car with comfort.  I now have 64K miles on my black/black Goat (have both factory options: 18""wheels and 6-Speed manual trans).  First thing I did was replace the stock shifter with a HURST billet short throw unit (chrome flat handle/black knob).  Other upgrades include a VOLANTE Cold-air intake, Magnaflow cat- back exhaust system, 180 degree TStat, E3 Sparkplugs, MSD plug wires, Royal Purple synthetic lubricants throughout and Diablosport tuning.  The original 400HP/400TQ is estimated to be about 445HP/450Torque. Current best fuel efficiency is 28.51 MPG at 75mph sustained on a 1,360 highway trip.  I average 19-20 city and 25-26 highway!"
pontiac,gto,2006,tim, 07/03/2008,An honest assessment,4,"This car is addictive to drive. I have an Impala and the GTO and it is so much fun to drive the GTO that it's hard to put it away when the weather's bad. I was addicted to it from the first test drive. I almost sold it due to the mpg but decided that anything this much fun SHOULD be expensive to drive. After the Pedder's suspension, it's been like driving a very expensive sport's car."
pontiac,gto,2006,GTOgirl, 12/03/2006,What a Car!!!!,5,"This is an unbelievable machine. It never ceases to amaze me with its power. The drive is just plain awesome. The 6-speed manual is a must. Just a few practicality cons, only because I use it for an everyday vehicle (which by the way I highly recommend). Access to the back seat is pretty close to impossible, in the rain the car is all over the place (which adds to the fun but takes away safety), and the trunk barely has room for groceries. But let me tell you I'd much rather have that engine than trunk space. It's such a monster. Better snatch 'em up while you can. Unless the decide to re-release at a later date, the 2006 is the last model."

Because in GTOs comparable class, Mustangs-Camaros-Challengers- dare I say Corvettes are not 20+K better..GTO WILL do everything just as good or even exceed beyond the latest greatest built tech at a fraction of the cost! Thank-you GM for this hidden gem in the performance world that no one seems to know..Add to fraction of cost few minor bolt on full weight 11.9s 1/4mile runs at track:)

pontiac,gto,2006,Dean Wheatley, 10/29/2006,GTO,4,"I needed a sports car with back seats that actually had some performance - and that's one thing this car plenty of: performance.  The vette V8 engine is the reason that you buy this car. Fit and finish is good (as good, if not better than the vette) but handling is, unfortunately, nothing to write home about. The suspension setup is a bit too soft and the tires are nowhere near grippy enough to keep traction. With 400 ponies, you need the traction! The stick shift is just awful and the stick shift is just OK (no overdrive ).  Despite is many failings, I believe this is the best bang for the buck. Tighter handling than the gt-500 and almost as quick. A bargain!"
pontiac,gto,2006,Bdav, 04/16/2017,You really do want one!,5,"2nd 2006 6sp I have had, 1st bought in 08 with 6k miles and drove every day for 6 yes until drunk driver totaled it @95k miles. Took a couple months to find another, had 23k miles. Have had muscle cars for most of my life (chevelle SS, cuda, coronet 440, mustang, and corvette) all either late 60's or early 70's and these GTO's have been the most fun to drive. Great, torque filled motor, solid trans, handles well, motor sound that will turn heads stock, and a very comfortable interior with what u need and not much else. Trunk space is small but so what. Back seat is tough to get in and out of, but again this is not designed as a BMW 5 series replacement. Perfect car, no.......until u get in and punch it. More fun than the law should allow. Maint costs are higher for many reasons but again, this is a muscle car, not a drive to get groceries car.......sure makes getting groceries fun though. Most underrated used car on the market, glad young kids don't know much about them, more power than inexperienced can handle. Few made, fewer left....future collector gem.

Inside I was treated to a plush leather interior,  blaupunkt radio with Bose speakers plenty of room to stretch, it does not come with all sorts of gadgets that's why I gave it a 4 star in reliability  driving normal tires only last 15 k miles and that's fine by me its a hell of a car it's a drivers car  and it made me feel like a kid and gave me a smile every time I flipped that ignition on an all 8 cylinders come alive I would own one again but will never buy a new GM product again as they have shut down Pontiac. Sad day for Pontiac fans who the hell drives a Buick ????????

pontiac,gto,2006,EJT, 12/08/2009,Buy a Ford,3,"Fun to drive good performance for the money.  This is my second GM product and would buy a Ford next time.  Have had a half dozen Fords and never saw the service department.  This my second GM and new the service guy at both dealers on a first name basis.  5- weeks of ownership and already have my 3rd service appointment.  Similar experience when I purchased a Cadillac Deville.  No major problems but lots of small stuff.  It s not the problems so much as the inconvenience.  All the trips back and forth to the dealer, being late to work cause you have drop of the car and then having to leave early to pick it up.  "
pontiac,gto,2006,branj70, 03/26/2012,Amazing car,4,"I have an '06 6-speed in Spice Red and this is by far one of the nicest cars GM could have offered. The interior is as comfortable as a new Cadillac, and very original. NOTHING on the inside was borrowed from any other US GM cars, since it's Holden. The only problems I've had are the junk stock struts and they're not difficult to replace. Also, it's difficult to get replacement parts since you can only get them Australia, otherwise if you find them here in the US, you'll pay through the nose. It's an absolutely amazing and powerful car, just take care of them!!!"
pontiac,gto,2006,John, 04/30/2009,Great even as a Daily Driver,4,"I drive my GTO daily when I'm in town. Unfortunately the car sits at the local airport 3-4 days per week. The car is perfect for me as a daily driver. It has great power, it's unique in that the GTO is not so plentiful out there that people see them everywhere so they notice it when they do see one, it handles well for the muscle car it is and it's comfortable even for me at 6'4"" tall. "
pontiac,gto,2006,gto400, 11/21/2009,First performance car!,4,From the day I bought my '06 quicksilver GTO had a smile on my face everytime I get behind the wheel. I like the fact that you do not see one on every corner and get a wave from fellow GTO owners on the road. Averaged almost 25mpg and 400 miles to a tank when I drove from New Mexico to Michigan.
pontiac,gto,2006,StealthLS2, 02/07/2010,Refined Muscle Car w Subtance over Style,4,"Re-introduced in 2004, the GTO early press reviews raved about the driving experience, interior and build quality, but the exterior styling left everyone underwhelmed. Many of us who fondly recalled the GTOs of the muscle car era felt the new version didnt live up to the memory, and sales didnt meet GMs expectations. Oh so many missed a great car.  Open the hood and you will find one of the best motors on the planet, the General Motors LS2, a 400 horsepower V8 that can motivate you to 60 in under 5 seconds. Stealth looks combined with the LS2 power plant make for a modern muscle car with capabilities that require you take a deeper look to fully appreciate."
pontiac,gto,2006,Austin, 01/29/2010,YES!,4,"I wanted a GTO since they came out in 2004, I finally got one, in an automatic burnt orange. I couldn't be happier with this car. So far I have only put about 100 miles on it in town. It sure does turn some heads. This is pretty much the only sports car I can drive being that I am 6'7"" 370lbs. I tried getting in a challenger, and charger, but the center console dugg into my leg in the wrong spot, and the insurance on the SRT8 was ridiculous. Plus the GTO will beat the 50k SRT8 all day long stock to stock. Hell if I put 50k into my Goat, I would have a 1500+hp car. In my opinion the GTO is the best muscle car. If you are looking at on, GET IT, if you have one LOVE IT!"
pontiac,gto,2006,Richard Smith, 10/09/2006,Lots of Muscle,4,"Going from a 1991 Trans Am GTA to a 2006 GTO is like moving up to the penthouse suite.  The GTO embodies raw power and a fun factor that is off the chart.  Once you hit the gas in 3rd and 4th gear you had better be strapped in because the car takes off like a rocket; have some fun with a unsuspecting passenger.  The ride is much different from other muscle cars, its nimble and handles the road like a mid size sedan.  Thank you Pontiac for reviving a legitimate modern day muscle car."
pontiac,gto,2006,Mike, 06/17/2017,Awesome,5,"Fun car to drive. Had the car about 3 years drive it once in a while only a toy. Has 17K  miles all original, 6 speed.The shifter should have been better.It shifts fine but spacing is long throw. There is a upgrade for it but too lazy and want to keep it original. Plenty of power and great handling for my needs. Good highway mileage ( about 25 mpg) around town not so good. Best car I ever owned.

Update >>> Had about 6 years now. Drive it very little. It only sees nice days and the car is so much fun to drive. Always puts a smile on my face. 
update>>> 7 or 8 years now. The hydraulic throw out bearing is a common problem. Mine failed.Keep resavoir filled with clean fluid you may avoid the problem. Haven't fixed it yet.  Still love the car.
"
pontiac,gto,2006,Dillon, 09/12/2017,GOAT,5,"There's nothing to know. My 2006 GTO has 169xxx miles and runs perfectly. I get between 17 and 24 mpg. I can drive for hours and rarely get uncomfortable. Also, the real reason to buy this car... I have a 400 horsepower LS2 corvette engine, I never loose to any modern muscle cars and can beat some corvettes.

pontiac,gto,2006,yuba4, 03/14/2011,garage trophy,4,"bought new in 2006, manual trans.
After initial problems with front struts (bad oil from factory), and subsequent front anti-roll bar link failure, car has run well.
Its basically an engine with a car tagging along.
Shifter rattles.
Otherwise, I'm very happy with it.
Love the styling and the ride, fuel economy good for a 400HP (typically 22.9 mpg).
Low overhang in the back.
I added a receiver (for bike rack), and it hits the ground on some driveway exits.
Outward visibility is poor, but that's a style compromise.
Ingress/egress hampered by low doorway - still hit my head on that.
Love the car - probably keep 20 years."
pontiac,gto,2006,gazpipe, 10/15/2010,Move out of my way!,4,"I bought my black on black goat in March of 2010.  I didn't even drive it, i just started it up.  I drove it off the lot and hit the highway from Modesto to Sacramento.  The wheels chirp with a touch of the pedal and I love my car and thank God all the time for it.  No mechanical problems.  My auto shifter did break (the part that pushes in to engage the trans) but I glued with crazy glue.  People love to scratch up my back bumper because they're haters and careless.  Don't hate, appreciate.  Maybe if they save up their money and if there are any left they can have one too.  People always say ""what! you have a gto!""  I say ""yes, black on black and I love it"", it beats anything on the road!"
pontiac,gto,2006,GOAT Dude, 11/22/2008,This Car is a Wolf in Sheep's Clothing,4,"The Holden boys get it. Big engine with great styling and quality goodies inside. No wonder Bob Lutz looked at this car and brought it to the states. Other than the Vette GM does not have clue when it comes to building a performance automobile. My initial thoughts about the car in 04 was that it looked like an extended wheel base Grand Am with a 5.7 liter engine which was just OK. By 06 the Aussie brain trust got it right. True dual exhaust, hood scoops and a 6.0 rocket engine under the hood. Mine is a red on red six speed pavement pulverizer. Gimme a break this is a 13 second car out of the box. It's a vette with a back seat and trunk with a high quality cowhide interior.  None to the GOAT. RIP GTO.... The Pontiac / Holden boys need to develop a G8 coupe to compete with the 2010 Camaro and Genesis coupes. Hopefully GM will allow the boys from down under to make another great muscle car with a six speed and only two doors. "

pontiac,gto,2006,Doug, 10/02/2005,"Dream car for under $29,000",4,"Just got an '05 cyclone grey w/ 6 speed- -it rocks! I've had Mustang GTs, a Z- 28, Grand National and other ""enthusiast"" cars, none are even close to a GTO in performance, comfort and overall enjoyment. Apologies are in order to the motorists I've no doubt scared w/ the outrageous passing power and noise, but that's about the only downside I've seen yet. It is also cool how much respect this car gets, lots of looks and compliments and people asking what 400hp feels like. Traction control and abs allowed for a real fun ride recently in the rain, which was a big suprise recalling other muscle cars complete inability on the wet. Gas mileage well over 20 on a recent tank w/ mostly hiway miles. "
pontiac,gto,2006,jcoyle, 08/08/2006,Leaking Struts,2,"I purchased this car new on 6-30, noticed it leaking on 7-1.  Both front struts blown.  Cannot drive car and still waiting on parts as of 8-8.  Fluid leaked onto front brake pads and rotors making dangerous to drive.  GM knew this was a problem with all 06's and continues to sell them without fixing this first.  Pontiac has been a nightmare to deal with.  Refuses to extend warranty to cover time I've been without car.  Do a search for 06 gto leaking struts and read other's stories.  Terrible customer service."
pontiac,gto,2006,blackgoat, 11/30/2008,Sleeper,4,I purchased an '06 GTO over a year and a half ago and still smile every time I start it up. It is by far the best car that I have ever owned and a blast to drive. The car looks much better in person than in pictures and most people have no idea what it is. The engine sounds great and the acceleration is impressive. The car may have sold better if the styling was more retro and less European but it is nice driving a car that you don't see at every stop light. The seats are very comfortable and the gas mileage is not too bad considering the power under the hood. It has been very reliable and the car can be modded if 400 hp is not enough for you.
pontiac,gto,2006,Ray Willis, 06/16/2006,My GTO Experience,4,"I bought a new 1964 GTO and a new 1967 gto convertible which were both very good cars in handling and performance.  However, my new 2006 GTO is so much better in every way that the old GTO's do not compare.  The only exception is the body style of the new GTO is not quite as good as it should be for true muscle car style."
pontiac,gto,2006,GTO06, 12/17/2005,Faster please,3,Overall happy with the GTO would like to see some classic features highlighted. 
pontiac,gto,2006,Its a Monaro, 01/27/2006,What the GTO really is....,4,"What Americans need to know is that the GTO was originally created by Holden (Australia) for Australian drivers tastes, in terms of design. The clean low lines (minus that useless rear wing is what aussies want in a big V8 RWD coupe. Pontiac never had any design input when the car was designed. It is Pontiac marketing people that got it wrong by trying to relive the Good'ol days, not the original designers that got it right! Pontiac insisted on smaller and uglier wheels, the pontiac grill and bonnet nostrils, the add on rear wing and the lack of climate control, all to fit U.S taste and budget contraints. What american buyers must face is that they are buying a Monaro, badged as GTO"
pontiac,gto,2006,bob, 06/23/2006,bob's gto,5,"Outstanding vehicle; excellent handling, performance above expectations, a huge improvement over original circa 60's GTO's (I had both a 1965 and a new 1968)"
pontiac,gto,2006,rick, 07/31/2006,06 GTO,4,i purchased my GTO in june of 06 i was pleased in the comfort of the interior and performace but not blown away. can't get much better for the price range unless you are willing to spend an extra 10 grand on a corvette or mustang shelby GT500
pontiac,gto,2006,Rick, 06/02/2018,Hilarious car (2006 GTO),5,"I was informed a few years ago that this was not a Goat—it was a hilarious car. He was right.  Excellent value and laughs for the money and if you like it sideways—this  is your car.   (Turn traction control off first). Or if you like to continuously spin the tires through third gear on the 6 speed manual transmission. (At my age I run out of xxxxs above that).  Everything still works in my car.   Even the original remote car keys.   CD player.   Ac. Lights.  Electronics. Only mechanical problem in 15 years was the hydraulic slave cylinder—other than mechanic induced problems—choose your mechanics wisely.  Never have had a ticket or wreck in this car—choose your glory pedal options wisely also.   Rear tires don’t last for some reason.
"
pontiac,gto,2006,GTOBoy, 01/12/2006,Could be better,2,"Definitely could be better. The GTO name did not bring out the best in this car, it is more of a tag glued on. Performance is not the best, the exterior has that ""Grand Am"" feel. On the plus side, the fuel economy is pretty good, though it could be better for the lack of performance."
pontiac,gto,2006,06goatman, 05/30/2008,my gto,4,Absolutely love to drive this car. Punch the gas pedal and feel the smile on your face grow. The interior definitely was a pleasant surprise over other GM cars. The leg room in the back seats very surprising. 2 adults can sit comfortably in back. Getting into the backseats can be a bit of a pain but once back their its all good.  
pontiac,gto,2006,rag, 06/08/2008,"If you didn't get one, you lost out",5,"I love my 06 GTO. I currently also have a 67 GTO which I have owned over 30 years. I use the new one as a daily driver and find it to be extremely comfortable. My average gas mileage is about 15 which I don't think is too bad. It goes up a lot on the highway. I love the looks of this car. The people who were turned off because it didn't have the ""retro"" look lost out. I was thrilled by its looks. Who wants to spend this kind of money to have a car that looks like its 30 years old. The drivetrain is spectacular. Getting in the back seat is difficult but I have had myself and 3 others in the car on several occasions. I am leasing it and am planning on buying it at the end of the lease. "
pontiac,gto,2006,mike. queens NY, 06/29/2008,My GTO,5,"I bought my gto about a year ago, I passed the dealership and saw her parked out front so I stopped and decided to look a little closer. As I'm looking at her  the salesperson comes out and asked me if I ever drove one. I said no, few minutes later he took a copy of my lic, gave me a dealer plate  and tells me come back in like an hour or so. After about 20 mins of driving it  I knew  I was keeping her. I'm 6 ft3   I thought the car was very roomy for a coupe. And not to mention the power and torque, I missed having a v8. The next day I picked up my new car."
pontiac,gto,2006,John Bruning, 06/30/2008,Ultimate Sleeper,4,"Okay, so the Monero didn't make it in the U.S. market. Under any other name, it would have been a hit, especially if the price had been competitive with the Mustang GT. Purists didn't like the exterior, non-muscle car styling, so the GTO died after '06.  Those of us who own a modern GTO know the truth: this is one of the fastest sleeper cars ever built. The 400 HP V8 sets the Goat on its haunches with a toe-twitch. It handles superbly and the stiff feel of the steering wheel is a huge improvement over the numb and the mundane.  Forget the Mustang GT. Forget the Charger RT or SRT8. None of those three muscle cars can touch the all- round performance, handling and power of the '06 GTO."
pontiac,gto,2006,Trowbridge, 07/11/2008,You'll be impressed!,5,"The greatest thing is power. First test drive hooked in less than one on ramp to the interstate. Excellent gas mpg 18/23 and with the power you've got this thing is sick. I changed out the stock suspension with the Pedders Street II and the ride quality is about the same but the way it handles through the curves is crazy fun. I cannot tell you how many times I've had looks from people - every stoplight it seems, and even from Lamborghini drivers. If you haven't bought one, and you're still undecided, you better try to find one that has less then 10K on it because once these babies are gone, they'll be talked about years from now, as the car that got away. I've had it for 19 months, 0 shop time."
pontiac,gto,2006,2006gtobob, 09/02/2008,2006 the original is still the greatest,5,"After taking a test drive I was hooked to say the least. and after finding the brazen orange color under the spotlight at a local dealer I had to have one. Less than a week later I am the proud owner of a brazen orange 6- speed that gets great fuel mileage and second looks from those not knowing what had just passed them. Getting on the local interstate is just some of the fun when those 400 plus horses are put to the test, the feel of the engines torque really sets you in your seat just proving the power is there, Pontiac sums it up best We Build Excitement (oh just to mention 23 mpg highway/18 around town occasional flogging is my est mpg) having fun"
pontiac,gto,2006,masteropunk, 09/04/2008,Goat-Tastic!,5,I love this car.  Owned a supercharged Cobalt before this and the power in the GTO is so great over the latter.  I have recently added an 80 mm turbo amongst other things and am running at a cool 1011 hp off the dyno.  I loved this car stock and love it even more with the additions.
pontiac,gto,2006,David, 09/22/2008,2006 GTO first hand,4,"The car starts right up every morning.  The drive is kind of bumpy due to the sporty suspension.  I love the small block v-8.  Runs better when driven hard, like most corvette engines.  Dislike the locking mechanism for the door locks.  Wont let you lock the doors with out pushing the button.  The passenger seat is horribly slow to move forward and back.  So getting people or children in the back is not fun.  The shifter feels long, and the exhaust note is great at higher rpms.  The headlights should have been xenon.  The blaupunkt cd player distorts easily with bass.  The steering is heavy on fast corners.  straight acceleration is phenomenal.  Ill never buy another one, but ill keep mine."
pontiac,gto,2006,Millefune, 12/22/2007,2006 Pontiac GTO,4,"I purchased my GTO in August 2007. Coming from a supercharged 2000 Honda Accord EX V6, this car's performance really blows me away. I'm still afraid to go full throttle with the traction control turned off. My only complaints are that the interior lighting would have been much better if it were red like the rest of of current day Pontiacs, instead of the green that it is, and that they put wider wheels and tires in the rear. It's just too easy to break traction by depressing the throttle a bit. But for the price of the car, you just can't get as much power and comfort. I love it when people stop and stare at her. I don't know what critics are talking about when they say GTOs don't look good."
pontiac,gto,2006,RENESIS, 10/24/2008,Renesis,4,"Well I kept the car for a little while and it was a good experience. I wouldn't buy it again though due to the following reasons. 

1) the car has no steering feel and it doesn't communicate with you at all so you cant drive with precision 

2) the back seat has a lot of room but getting in and out is big problem and trust me it is.

3) Resale values are horrible but I didnt look at this when I bough it brand new.

4) Moding can be expensive and there are some mods you need right away like shifter and springs and shocks/ struts. Better tires. 

Acceleration is great and so far it's faster in STRAIGHT LINE than these: 350z, evo,mustang, srt8,E46 M3, Speed6, S4,C55 AMG. It's a lot of car for the money "
pontiac,gto,2006,Mr Norm, 11/16/2008,Fast and Furious,4,"The day I received this car all I had was a smile on my face, I love the brazen orange paint, the crazy torque the comfortable seats and the launch oh my god, faster than all the sports cars that I have own, and I had some good ones, and IROC-Z, Mustang GT, Buick Grand National this thing smokes them all I do have some performance parts such as eibach springs, koni shocks, subframe connectors, alum- driveshaft bmr axels and stubs headers, supercharger, comp cam and magnaflow exhaust. But the thing I like the most is that you don't see them all over the road. I'll keep it until the wheels fall off."
pontiac,gto,2006,aplvn, 11/23/2008,I love my little Billy,4,"I bought this car brand new from the dealer in 2007 even though it was a 2006. I love the power, and the looks. I added an aftermarket sunroof (it wasn't an available option). My first time at the drag races in anything worth racing and ran 13 flat in an automatic. Even though I love the car, I would never buy another one. I have had nothing but problems with this one. Current mileage is 14911. Last week a sprag in the transmission went out. A/C broke twice, plastic chromes on console and steering wheel bubble from heat, glove box snapped, makes clicky noises all over that dealership can't fix. Floor mat clips are bad design (replaces 6 times), needs a convertible seat, Blaupunkt stinks!"
pontiac,gto,2006,douglasrmyers, 12/27/2008,The Great One,5,"GTO is by far the best car I have ever owned.  Fast, powerful, comfortable, handles and rides beautifully. There is nothing else like it."
pontiac,gto,2006,sweetface, 01/18/2009,How much can on person smile,4,"When I went to a quarter mile track near where I live and I heard and saw one of these beautiful sleepers go down the track, I had to have one. Luckily only 2 months later there was a beautiful Cyclone grey one in mint condition ( you could eat off the engine) sitting in my garage. I have loved getting up every morning since knowing that I get to drive it every day.  It's powerful, comfortable and the most fun automobile I have ever owned. I cannot stop smiling every time I get behind the wheel.  What an awesome car!"
pontiac,gto,2006,Markie629, 02/10/2009,Best bang for you buck,4,"After having owned a 320HP Supra, and a 280 HP Mustang, this is absolutely my favorite car to date. The LS2 is fantastic, along with the 6 speed tranny (borrowed from the Z06 Corvette) and the rest of the car is generally fantastic as well. The interior is large enough to fit my 6'2"" 240 lb frame very comfortably whether in the front, or back. The onbord computer is great with more options than a car this price should have. The stock stereo is great quality as well with an adjustable subwoofer accessable through the trunk. With average fuel economy of between 18 MPG city and 27 MPG highway (based on my own spirited driving), fuel consumption is quite low. Overall a great performance bargain!"
pontiac,gto,2006,James, 02/17/2009,Love my goat,4,"Bought my 06 Cyclone gray GTO in march of 07. It now has 20,000 miles on it. And they've been trouble free thus far. This car has a better build quality, inside and out than the domestics seem to have. The performance is first rate. Mine has the 6 speed tranny. This engine has so much midrange power...It flat out hauls."

pontiac,gto,2006,autopower, 03/26/2009,The Legend Returns,4,"Acquired this car new after turning in an '04 BMW 330 coupe. Definitely great power for the money. It doesn't handle like a BMW or Porsche, but those aren't muscle cars. Got the 6spd manual with the 18"" wheels. Average 21 mpg in mixed driving, when I behave. The rear can get sloppy with slight road imperfections or slippery surfaces, but it teaches respect. After over 2 years I still dislike the gearbox, though. I despise the 1 to 4 lock-out in city driving, and it repeatedly pops out of gear. But just one stab at the throttle removes all frustrations. The exhaust note sells the car. It is quiet when you're cruising, but loud when you get into it."
pontiac,gto,2006,Rick Francis, 04/06/2009,Best Car I've Ever Had By Far,4,"I've got the more rare Impulse Blue Metallic '06 and I love her to death. Aside from a few things breaking (Water Pump went out, Radiator died twice, gas cap lock popping loose) I absolutely love this car. I've had several different Mustangs and once I drove this car I traded in the '94 Cobra I had to get this Lucky To Own car. I am actually designing a custom cold-air intake for mine and I hope to patent it and hopefully have it out for all you other goat lovers to buy at a much cheaper price than K&N intakes. Look for it soon! I've had mine on the 1/4 mile twice and had a huge grin all the way down the track. Especially since I went up against a Mustang GT and won on my first pass."
pontiac,gto,2006,Jim Still, 07/01/2009,Love it,4,"Holden chassis is excellent, great 400HP power with 6 speed and IRS.  What else do you need?"
pontiac,gto,2006,nac4life, 09/29/2009,Wolf in Sheeps Clothing,4,"What more can you say?  400 HP.  Quiet, smooth ride, handles good and can take off like a rocket in a heartbeat.  Sure the y could have done more with the appearance but that's what makes this car such a good package.  Yeah some people may have bought a bad one and come on here and rip the car, but you'll have that with any model.  Take it for a spin, you won't be disappointed.  I sure wasn't."
pontiac,gto,2006,s, 03/28/2010,The best muscle sports car around!,5,My 06 ls2 Pontiac gto is an automatic and it's great fun to drive with the 0- 60 at 4.4 sec and runs 12.8 1/4 mile down the track. it can pretty much beat anything out there!
pontiac,gto,2006,PG, 04/27/2010,The Great One,5,"I have a 6spd manual Spice Red Metallic with the black interior.  It was love at first drive.  I grew up riding in my uncle's 1968 GTO so when Pontiac came out with this car I knew that some day I had to own one.  The torque of the LS2 is something you cannot describe accurately with words and the 6 spd makes it even more blissful.  The suspension is adequate but you won't be winning any autocross meets anytime soon.  Contrary to what some people may think as far as styling is concerned, the original GTO was nothing more than a dressed up Tempest with a bigger engine so I don't see the big deal with purists wanting a retro looking Goat."
pontiac,gto,2006,thegovnr, 09/07/2010,baaaaad ls2 goat,5,"I have a 6 spd manual and I have to say its the best car I've ever owned and I'm putting this against past cars of mine such as 91 mr2 turbo, 96 Impala ss, 95 infiniti g20 and 00 Lincoln ls v8. It rides better than the Lincoln and has more power than the Impala. On one hand it doesn't handle like an mr2 but for what it is its fun to push into the corners and bring out with 400 ft. Lbs ! Sideways. The tires are cheap to replace because of size. Exhaust tone is better sound to me than the very nice 6 disc blaupunkt stereo. Bose should have been the choice on that. Service is easy. With 20k for miles when I bought it for 18k it's a steal ! Avg mpg is 24 and thats from stop and go to 75 mph highway."
pontiac,gto,2006,eddie gomez, 09/18/2010,Pleasantly surprised,4,"Bang for my buck, endorphin inducer, i'm am very happy with my purchase"
pontiac,gto,2006,GTOgirl, 02/07/2008,Too Good to Lose,5,"Bought this beast in Mar 06 n then I wrote a review in Dec 06. Since then, I've had a baby and because of the almost impossible feat to get into the backseat (esp holding a newborn) I was forced to sell it.  I can't say enough about this car. I'm still unable to find the words to explain how awesome it is. Thick, solid, muscular, fast, sexy, sleek, smooth, low key but at the same time eye catching. Unbelievable"
pontiac,gto,2006,jay baronoff, 06/29/2005,Get one before it is too late!,4,"Disregard what you hear about the new goat not being ""retro"" enough and buy one before gm kills it off. I had a 64 gto as a teenager and again about 15 years ago. I have waited a long time for pontiac to do it again and the wait was worth it. The performance and the quality are second to none. I changed the front grilles and spolier to the sport appearance package items. Also bought three sets of the ""gto"" letters from the '04 trunklid and applied one set on the right rear decklid and two sets on the rear quarter panels, just like the goats of the 60s. Makes a big difference in capuring the gto look.  I bought this as a ""keeper"" to tuck away and drive on sunny days."
pontiac,gto,2006,JB, 10/09/2005,GTO is awesome,5,"If you love HP, you will love this car.  It left my AMG55 in the dust!!!  My friend just bought a new STI.. NO CONTEST!!!  This cars quality and workmanship is one to beat for the price.  Sure it doesn't have all the bells and whistles that some luxury cars do, but for the price I am saving on the sticker I can have those things installed, customized, and still beat them on the street and the price.  I LOVE THIS CAR!!  AND I LOVE DRIVING IT!! IT gets looks wherever I go.. Probably because they hear me coming!!!"
pontiac,gto,2006,Jam, 10/11/2005,Everybody should have one!,4,"I have owned a 350Z, Acura, and RX-8.  When I traded in my mazda for this car I was a little hesitant, but I am glad that I did.  Aside from the power, the car is very confortable and roomy.  I feel as though I am driving a cadillac the ride is so smooth.  Many have said that the car's looks don't appeal to them, well it looks much better from behind the wheel.  I am lucky enough to have gotten a 6-speed and it has been a pleasure.  Oh, and by the way it has a 6.0 liter V-8.  Enough said.  If you are in the market for a practical rocket, this is the way to go."
pontiac,gto,2006,Rick Joy, 10/28/2005,Rick's review,4,For the price this is the best handling fastest car I have ever owned. It is a super fun car to drive. With the options available it is really nice looking. 
pontiac,gto,2006,muscle guy, 11/05/2005,100%,5,"The body looks similar to other pontiacs, but still remains unique. Not only is it the strongest stock street car, excluding lambo's and what not, but it turns heads too. To make it look a little more hot, i bought front to tail custom work. New front kit, hood, rims,tires, roof,side kit, doors,tint, spoiler, rear kit, exhaust, cold air intake, a chip, QTEC, dyno, tranny, clutch, suspension.... yeah it was plenty of cash and voided the warranty, but who gives when you got a car this hot."
pontiac,gto,2006,Dacius, 12/08/2005,The new Vette,5,This car is simply amazing. 400 hp and for 30k. There simply is not a vehicle that can come as close. My salesmen said that the car is made in Australia and I am starting to wish I lived in the land down under. The car purrs at idle and growls as you go through the gears. The interior is something you would never expect from a Domestic car. Absolutely perfect car. 
pontiac,gto,2006,BOB, 12/14/2005,Goat,4,Great performance; handling on par with european cars; acceleration fierce; excellent interior fit and finish                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
pontiac,gto,2006,Jon Franken, 01/02/2006,Options required,4,"I bought the '06, but I wanted one without those ridiculous ""nostrils"" in the hood. GM says no. Straight line fun all day and all night, gotta love that. I can only assume other reveiwers praising handling have never driven a car that handles. My wife's VW GTI runs rings around this on any corner and my old Subaru STI would embarass it on any road circuit. I love the noise, I love the power, but I'll be spending a lot of money upgrading the suspension using GM Europe parts, adding sat nav and upgrading the stereo. I like the simple styling and, once I get my 2004 hood (no fake nostrils), I think this will be the finest looking coupe on the road."
pontiac,gto,2006,ed hill, 01/10/2006,torrid red,5,The way the car drives even at slow speeds it great. Most people have no idea what it is at first then the original GTO folks all of a sudden do not care for it.. The aussies did a fine job on the car only gripe is going from a z28 to GTO is the seat does not go low enough but i am fine with it now. The more new style muscle cars the big 3 build the better//   
pontiac,gto,2006,Care2bjs2, 02/04/2006,I love it,5,"Was at the dealership with a friend and was talked into test driving an 06 GTO I really wasn't planning on purchasing one but wow!!!!2 hours later I was home with a brand spanking new Brazen Orange GTO This car is awesome, much faster than the 05 Mustang I just sold, it's hard to believe its only 100 hp more because it seriously feels like twice the power and the interior is way better So far the car has been perfect in every way"
pontiac,gto,2006,BillyGoat, 03/09/2006,Buy for POWER and driveability,4,"After reading some of the other reviews, other purchasers seem to want a luxury car with high performance and 30 MPG.  NOT !!  The now departing 2006 GTO will be a collector's car soon enough, I'd highly recommend begging, borrowing, or stealing the $$ to buy one.  The dealer I bought from in Arizona had TEN GTOs for sale - I had the pick of the litter.  Sold at INVOICE $$, this dealer simply wanted to unload his inventory...advantage ME.  NO VEHICLE currently made will give you the wide swath of luxury and performance this car will.  Just drive one.  400 HP, great driving position and non-descript exterior will keep the idiots wondering what the hell just flew past.  BUY ONE."
pontiac,gto,2006,bobbyWON, 03/13/2006,This car rocks! Period,4,"A lot of these other reviewers who have complaints, don't appreciate the ""grown ups"" sports car market.  We don't want giant wings that look like ironing boards, or exhaust that sounds like it came off the old weedwacker.  We want smooth style, power and performance.  It's about fluidity, and the new GTO has it nailed.  It's fast, yet not rambunctious and noisy like the dodge ""hemi"" junk, and it rides very nice, it is extremely reliable due to utilizing the time-tested small block chevy. Its just an awesome car anyway you look at it, the price is excellent for what you get too."
pontiac,gto,2006,Kent H., 04/09/2006,Great Adult Sports Car,4,"Wonderfull performing handling and looking modern performance car.This car is quiet smooth quik and solid.Im 50 yrs old and this is only my second new car, it takes a lot to get my attention but this car did.I bought it without even test driving it i knew i would not be disapointed and it was better than i expected.I have owned several muscle cars including a 70 chevelle convertible with a 540 bbc in it that i still have.The old cars are great but this 06 GTO is by far the best all around performance car that i have owned.A corvette driveline with a different body on it for under 30k thats hard if not impossible to beat."
pontiac,gto,2006,17 Year old in a GTO, 04/21/2006,Better than the Mustang,4,"Whether driving in the city, on the highway, or on rural roads, you know you're going to have a smooth ride. Waiting at the line of a red light always makes you feel uneasy with all the looks you'll get-ranging from a thumbs up, or another hand gesture. It was raining heavily one day, and I was driving home. Upon turning a 90 degree turn to get on the on ramp of I- 5, the car started to lose traction. Luckily the TC kicked in, and stopped my wheels from spinning giving me the ability to turn out from nearly smacking into a barrier. The car has been great for getting me to school, and the Dragstrip uptown. Only complaints from passengers comes from the 5th man-only 3 passanger seats+driver"
pontiac,gto,2006,Patrick, 05/05/2006,Power,4,"I have driven 3 suped up mustangs during the 90's, I have driven many other fast cars as well, this is by far the beefiest damn car I have driven by far, and for $31,500 (my purchase price) who can beat it?  I can stay up with all those fancy European sport cars for half the price.  The only thing I would change is the exterior styling could be a bit more refined.  The interior is gorgeous and comfortable.  This is my household's 3rd vehicle, so I don't need to much trunk space, I purchased this to commute to work with on nice days and for performance, period, all without taking out a second mortgage."
pontiac,gto,2006,kpdremn, 05/07/2006,Buy a goat,4,awesome car wish the steering wheel went down further.  has tire hop...
pontiac,gto,2006,Walt, 05/08/2006,"Comfort with ""musclecar"" power!",4,"Just bought mine a few weeks ago.  The engine is awesome, with a smooth, broad power band that lets you just drive around everyone else without a fuss.  If you really open it up then hang on, because the GTO is FAST.  The seats are top rate, the interior is very nice with excellent fit and finish.  To me the suspension is a good balance of performance and ride comfort.  The exterior is a bit bland, the trunk is small and the back seats are hard to get into, but none of that matters to me.  Good hwy gas mileage, but uses fuel at a phenomenal rate if you romp on it around town.  The GTO makes a very comfortable daily driver thats a blast to drive if you are into raw power."
pontiac,gto,2006,Kelly, 06/05/2006,Fun to drive,4,"The car is fun and fast, a real head turner especially in red. Have only had the car for 2 months and so far the car is what i expected of it."
pontiac,gto,2006,jeffster, 07/04/2006,GTO is an awesome car,4,"I have had this car for 2 weeks now, and I can't wipe the smile off my face every time I sit in the driver's seat.   Why more people haven't discovered this car I don't know, but better for me because it's that much more unique.   Has undescribable power from the Corvette LS2 V8, great balanced handling, most comfortable seats in any car I have ever owned, good size back seat (better than a mustang), great interior design.   GM finally got this car right for 2006 and now they aren't making them anymore.  If you are thinking about buying one, just go test drive it.  This is your last chance because they stopped making them last month.  No wonder this car is an icon in Australia!"
pontiac,gto,2006,wsw, 07/04/2006,The Best Yet,4,"This has to be my favorite car ever.  I do not know how many I have owned but the list includes Mustang GT's, Corvettes, Mercedes 560 SL's, Thunderbirds, etc.  This is the ultimate driving machine so far.  Outperforms everything else and is comfortable for my 6'3"", 275 pound body.  I do feel sorry for people that would have to ride in the back seat, but this vehicle was not purchased for them.  I have had some initial problems that I believe are attributable to transit involving the front end and strut failure.  Only 3000 miles so far so reliability would be slanted heavily by these problems if not properly viewed.   Overall, this car is great and has me looking for the next generation."
pontiac,gto,2006,busyduck, 07/13/2006,the goat,3,i just bought one of these cars coming out of a toyota supra turbo to this is a different change but i think i like this one a lot more more refined and still has the import build on the vehicle with american muscle with both combined it doesnt get any better than this
pontiac,gto,2006,Matt Jackson, 07/27/2006,Pontiac GTO,4,"The gto drives unbelieveably smooth and firm for as much horsepower it has and for being a sportscar. It drives similar to my mothers cadillac sts '06. The response is awesome, and i like how they made it a 2-door not like the dodge charger which is a 4- door and i dont like it. "
pontiac,gto,2006,BLKNGRYGTO, 08/18/2006,Love my GOAT,4,My cruise didn't work and the stop lights stuck on. Turns out the switch was bad. Repaired promptly by dealer. Drives solid and stable with no oversteer or understeer.
pontiac,gto,2006,Goatman, 08/23/2006,Just Bought,4,"I have had my 2006 GTO for all of two days now.  I took the day off work to just drive it around.  I had a blast with it and plan on having many more days just like today.  I recently sold a 1971 Oldsmobile 442 with a slightly built Olds 455.  I restored the car and it was my baby.  When I found myself in the market for a new car I needed one with power.  I found out the Challenger if coming out with a 5.7L and was turned off by the thought of the price for the upgrade when it becomes available.  I tested the Mustang GT and the GTO and immediately knew the GTO was the better of the two.  Considering where the market is going, the exterior styling could be better, but I still love the looks."
pontiac,gto,2006,Rick, 08/08/2005,2005 Pontiac GTO,5,I ordered the 2005 GTO with all of the features seen on the new 2006 GTO. In addition I ordered the 18 inch factory wheels and tires. The car arrived in July 2005. I is the best handling most powerfull car that I have ever owned. I would strongly suggest that it is the most exciting car that one could purchase for the money. The interior is excellantly styled and comfortable. The seating is satisfactory for four adults.
pontiac,gto,2006,JusFlyinBy, 10/12/2005,Comfort with a kick.,4,"I was shopping around most of May for Mazda RX-8s, BMW 3 series, Mustang GT's, Infiniti G35's, Nissan 350Zs and Subaru STi's. I never gave the GTO a thought. I just wasn't interested. That's until one day a salesperson convinced me to take a look and drive the GTO. I humored him and gave it a good look over and a drive and it just about changed my mind on the spot. Do a comparison, the GTO gives you everything these other cars have and more in some cases for the cheapest insurance and cost! You'll quickly grow on the bland exterior and start to see it as a clean, sharp design. Pic's dont  do justice. Go take an '06 out even if you aren't interested, you'll likely change your mind like I did."
pontiac,gto,2006,Sailmaker, 10/07/2005,Return of the G.O.A.T. (GTO),4,This car is amazing.  The raw horsepower makes it want to scream out of every gear shift.  To have 400 horsepower out of dealer is remarkable.
pontiac,gto,2006,Car Crazy Dude, 11/10/2005,2005 GTO 6 speed,4,"Awesome car, always eager to drive it! Needs nothing else added to it from purchase.  Love the IRS and the 400 hp 400 ft-lb torque!! Price to value is definitely unbeatable, Go GM. "
pontiac,gto,2006,Bob Negherbon, 11/22/2005,64 to 05,4,"I have a '64 and bought the 05, Wow! What a great car! The power is fantastic and so easy to use. A great automobile and especially for the price. This can only get better and maybe GM will keep it around. There are so many things that can be offered to maintain the legend, 'cause the new one is truly worthy of the name."
pontiac,gto,2006,mike, 11/16/2005,Just awesome,4,"This car can smoke 95% of the cars o the road. Comfort, mileage, performance. Very impressive, very happy with my purchase. For a stock car, this thing is VERY fast."
pontiac,gto,2006,igot1gto, 12/21/2005,I Got 1,5,"At 400 H.P. and 400 ft/lb torque and around town mileage with my 6 speed at just over 20 mpg, what else could you want?  It is great fun to drive ... it is fast with crisp handling and very effective braking.  The 200 watt Blaupunkt stereo/CD with surround sound is almost as enjoyable as just driving around with the windows open just listening to the motor hum ...  the fit and finish of the interior rivals any of my buddies BMW's and the 6 way power adjustable leather seats are very comfortable ... which is excellent ... especially when you consider the GTO is a reborn MUSCLE CAR built for speed and a feel for the road!  "
pontiac,gto,2006,GTO's , 01/11/2006,2006 GTO's,4,"The outside of the GTO is UGLY! It is to plain. If you see one going down the road no one turns their head and say ooo there is a GTO because the are not that recognizeable. They look to much like a Mazda 6, or and other sport sudan. Unlike the new Dodge Charger or Ford Mustang everyone goes ooo look at that. It is because they are very distinctive. There are no other cars that look like them. On a good note the interior and performance are perfect. "
pontiac,gto,2006,Jimmy, 01/31/2006,Most bang for the buck - AWESOME,4,"Recently purchased a Red 2006 GTO.  This car is outstanding considering the price range.  I can stay up with anyone on the road, including high priced Euro sports cars.  Very fun to drive.  Handles well, very rigid and well build, no sway whatsover.  Test drove a Dodge Charger prior to purchase, and there was no comparison.  I have owned and driven many Ford Mustangs, and other very fast vehicles, the GTO demolishes all of them.  The one negative would be... the exterior could use a bit more styling and not look so much like a typical Pontiac.  Although you can look at like this, it blends in with traffic, not to fancy looking, and it is a true SLEEPER.  Beautiful interior!!!"
pontiac,gto,2006,GTOJeff, 01/31/2006,06 GTO best one ever,4,"I have owned 6 GTOs over the years (1965-1971) and I was sceptical when I first drove the 2006 version but after only a short distance I could tell that this car was NOT a 60's musclecar it was better...more power and torque better brakes and superior handling The build quality of this GTO is superb and the interior is the nicest I have seen in all the cars I test drove (Mustang GT ,Mazda RX8, Dodge Charger) I seriously doubt you could get a better car in the 30K range with its 400hp,6 spd trans and independent rear This car is a pure blast to drive and not every boyracer in town has one"
pontiac,gto,2006,Zach Rubenstein, 02/14/2006,Zach's opinion,4,The GTO is fun and exiting to drive especially taking turns with out using breaks and just downshifting. This car is excellent for pontiac fans who want a big v-8 with a back seat. They will also know that it will knock off the competition with the charger and the corvette.
pontiac,gto,2006,JJay374, 03/18/2006,It's awesome,5,"I was an avid Mustang guy until I drove the GTO, and I must say, I am hooked.  The power, the handling are great.  People complain the stereo being bland, I personally don't buy a HP sports car for the stereo, but that's me.  "
pontiac,gto,2006,mike, 03/21/2006,2006 gto,4,very nice car and great performance. i was surprised that gas mileage i did get on a recent trip was almost 24 mpg with 6 speed manual. i have 2005 bmw 330i and only get 27 mpg on the highway. i was worried about insurance rates but my  insurance dropped about $600 for the year. can't figure that out and did not ask any questions.
pontiac,gto,2006,Stang Killer, 04/02/2006,Bringing the fun of driving back,4,"Living in one of the most traffic congested in the country, I have forgotten what it's like to have fun while driving until I purchased my Goat.  This car is a true sleeper.  It doesn't look like a muscle car but surprise.  I have raced a stock 06 Vette, Charger SRT8, and numerous Mustangs and none of them can get me off the line.  All the power you ever wanted is one mash of the gas pedal away."
pontiac,gto,2006,qwik06gto, 04/04/2006,Best Bang for the performance buck!,4,"Outstanding performance for the price of admission!  A Corvette with 4 seats.  Exterior styling could be more stylized.  Gas tank placement needs revision to free-up trunk space.  Sound system leaves much to be desired.  Once you drive it, nothing else matters!!!!"
pontiac,gto,2006,Ray Willis, 04/04/2006,Big Red,5,"I did not think they would ever bring the gto back wow what A car, excellent. I had a 1965 and a 1967 this 2006 is by far a much better car in every way, its to bad that they are going to stop making it after the 2006 are gone. Sadddddddddddddd"
pontiac,gto,2006,cadkins1990, 04/30/2006,its all good under the hood,4,she is a muscle car for sure it's all to mean if you're stuck in a family car from the 20th century
pontiac,gto,2006,Nick, 07/14/2006,Great Car,4,"This is the fastest car that most people will ever drive. The performance is awesome. I must say however, that the suspension does not match the engine. I guess to get that you have to spend the extra $20K and get a Corvette. Awesome car though, worth every penny."
pontiac,gto,2006,RidgeGoat, 07/18/2006,06 Pontiac Goat -- awesome,4,"What a fun car to drive. I wanted a daily driver with some kick. Have had all the BMW's,Mercedes,Audi's etc.... This car is power (400HP). Its just a great, comfortable car. I would rate it 10 in everything except gas milage (of course), I drive it 70 miles a day and its a pleasure. Has a great engine rumble to it. Stereo is pretty good, I do miss a compass and outside temp (loking to buy aftermarket rear view mirror that has it built in). To sum it all up, this car makes driving what it should be FUN! Plus there are loads of aftermarket goodies to buy. Go get one a have the next american classic. Sorry to see Pontiac saying goodbye to this rocket."
pontiac,gto,2006,matthew, 07/31/2006,GTO bad to the bone,4,This car is really fun and looks like a sleeper most people do not know what it is or what is under the hood (raw power baby)
pontiac,gto,2006,Josefina, 08/01/2006,2006 GTO Struts problem,3,2 weeks from purchase my daughter drove the car to later find that she couldn't drive the car because it was making a very loud noise on the passenger side. of course we scream and question if she did something to the car. of course not . We found  that the strut was defective  we figure ok is a defective strut no big deal. The car started making the same noise on the left over the weekend of course is going in tomorrow for another strut  I told the dealer to check the other 3 struts  but they said they don't have anyting from the manufacture for a recall. a little frustration having a new car 
pontiac,gto,2006,Chris Smith, 08/01/2006,2006 GTO - Bad struts!!!!!,4,"I am soured today because my GTO has 730 miles on it and the left front has blown out for the second time.  Each time strut oil is flung all over the place, melting the undercoating creating a goo that is difficult to cleanup.  Look on www.nhtsa.dot.gov to witness the 55+ entries for this problem alone. Pontiac also doesn't appear to be too concerned about this problem as well.  I get tons of lip service from their customer support but overall it is what we all know and expect as GM.  I am very saddened by this as I want GM the biggest and baddest.  Well... to my chagrin the latter is true.  My wifes Odyssey certainly looks like the better of the two purchases. "
pontiac,gto,2006,zero, 08/13/2006,So far so good,4,"So far so good.  No real problems.  A couple of defects upon purchase.  But nothing crazy or unable to be repaired by myself. 4500 miles and nothing has changed.  I know its not a lot of miles.  But I haven't had it long enought to foget those problems i might have had in the beginning.. which happen to be none in this case.  the styling is the styling.. think of it what you will.  I think its very euro GT.  Gets great mileage for the engine class, but thats not really an excuse for running an average of 20 mpg back and forth to work.  "
pontiac,gto,2006,Warren, 08/16/2006,Get back to where you once belonged GM!,5," Prior to owning my 2005 GTO I owned an 04 model, until a jackass in a pickup truck crossed the center line of the road and hit me head on. The fact that I walked away with only minor injuries is a testamonial to the quality of the car and the integrity of the design. The styling doesn't meet with the approval of some people, but I find it very appealing. The GTO gets plenty of respect at the stoplight, especially from Mustang drivers who know better !!!"
pontiac,gto,2006,RedLine, 08/26/2006,Domestic or Foreign?,4,"The GTO is an excellent example of a classic muscle car (classic being mid- sixties rather than early 70's)...conservative (""sleeper"" rather than ""boy racer"") exterior styling, jaw dropping power, and almost European handling characteristics.  The ride is comfortable and compliant with relatively little body lean while having fun. "

pontiac,gto,2006,Bret Salsbery, 08/31/2006,The Legend Lives and Doesn't Disappoint!,4,"I have owned my new 2006 GTO for a week now and I can honestly say it is the the most fun car to drive that I've ever had.  The acceleration is unbelievable for a four seat coupe.  I am one of the few I guess that actually likes the exterior design.  Let's face it, the original GTOs were not exactly ground breaking in exterior design, but who cared?  You buy a GTO for one reason, performance!!  Luckily, though, this car offers so much more!  The interior is awesome and comfortable.  The stereo is very nice.  The programmable dash is great as well.  The day after I bought mine I had performance mufflers installed and they just make this thing roar!!!!  Do yourself a favor, get a GTO!!!!!!"
pontiac,gto,2006,mn2006, 09/11/2006,Better than expected,5,"I saved up a long time to purchase this vehicle.  It was well worth the wait.  For the money, it is an excellent purchase with loads of power and performance.  It is difficult to go into the house once I get home.  If you don't own one and are considering it, then hurry to your local dealership and make the deal."
pontiac,gto,2006,Jenn, 09/12/2006,Traded my CTS for this baby,4,"I was sold on this vehicle the first test drive. There was no lag in the response to the gas like in my CTS. I do not feel the roll as stated in some reviews, maybe I need to try the turns a little faster :) Most work days I spend 6-8 hours driving. This car is comfortable.  The strong support of the seats makes you feel like the seat was handcrafted with you in mind.  Fast, fun and made in America, what else can a girl say!"
pontiac,gto,2006,Jim, 09/24/2006,Jim's Siver 6 speed GTO,4,"I love my GTO. I've owned it since 1/06 w/o any problems, never been back to the dealer. I like the styling. This is 2006 not 1966. The 2006  GTO can compete with the German and Japanese imports with  interior &  exterior styling,quality and price. What the imports don't have is an LS2 400/400 engine. No comparison.  I looked at Mustangs but interior was too plasticy and a little tight. I'm 6'4 200 and sit very compfortably in my GTO. I like having a unique car. Fords sells over 200,000 Mustangs/yr. Less than 15,000 GTO's /yr. Some people have complained about the GTO's styling  but it's 2006, not 1966. Mustangs retro look is good. But don't take anything away from the GTOs modern look."
pontiac,gto,2006,GTO DAN, 09/29/2006,"GTO---Gas, Tires, and Oooooooooooohhh",4,"I have owned 3 GTO's....1968,1969,and a 1970. I have owned the 70 since 1979. My son and I are rebuilding the 70 from the frame up. This will take several years and I need horsepower!! When I first saw the 2004 GTO, I was upset! It was missing all the markings of a GTO (single exhaust,no hood scoops,etc..etc.)When I saw the 2006,I test drove it. What a ride!! I love this car!! Please don't tell my 70. The build is perfect. No flaws,tight fit,comfortable, FAST and gas mileage!! I chose the automatic and it shifts perfectly and matches the engine's output no matter what the throttle position. I can't believe they stopped making it! The best way to describe the car is a 4 seat corvette!! GO GTO"
pontiac,gto,2006,jake, 10/01/2006,GTO Got To gO,4,"This was the most fun I have ever had driving a car. The sensation when you push the throttle is mind blowing. The steering is crisp and responsive, you definitely feel in control even when your slinging around a corner. Inside is roomy for a sports car (it maybe hard to get in/out the rear but its comfortable once inside). All in all the only complaint I have is there is a defect in the ignition that causes it to seize (mine was fixed by the dealership in an afternoon)."
pontiac,gto,2006,Bryan, 11/29/2006,Best.... Car.... Ever.,4,"Wow, what a fun car to drive. Everything from the comfortable and roomy all leather interior to the LS2 engine and exhaust sound is fantastic. In terms of interior roominess, this puts the Mustang to shame (same with the engine and power). 400 HP for $30,000, just try to find more power for a better price, you won't be able to."
pontiac,gto,2006,GTOfan, 12/30/2006,Amazing car,5,"The GTO is all about the driving experience.  Incredible car, comfortable and most handsome interior in class, seats 4.  Is a rocket ship with the Corvette LS2.  This car has been overlooked by many but is an amazing value."
pontiac,gto,2006,Mike Parker, 01/06/2007,Truly a bargain!,4,"The Pontiac GTO is a tremendous value. Where else can yu get 400 hp, nimble handling, nicely trimmed interior with accouterments, and that big-block burble that anyone who owned a 60's big-block knows so well? And get it all for UNDER $30 Grand? It's quick, and it's fast. It's under the radar good looking, clean and smooth. It takes a supercar to out- muscle it. It's always fun to dust 100K BMW's and 80K Porsches, Benzes and whatever else comes along. The looks of amazement on their faces are worth way more than the price of this car. GM got the 2006 exactly right, then left it to wither and die on the vine. What A SHAME!"
pontiac,gto,2006,4rdc, 01/09/2007,just real fun,4,"A very raw vehicle, no fancy dashboard computers, just a basic car, just a basic fast car, reminds me of cars gone by. Closest I have come to a real factory racer."
pontiac,gto,2006,Jonathan F, 01/15/2007,"Refined, yet beastly!",5,"I had test drove many different sporty cars before approaching the GTO.  I tried out a STI, WRX, BMW 330i, Evo, a G35, 350z  Then, after the advice of my father, I choose to test drive a GTO.   That was all that was needed to seal the deal.  While the G35 was probably the nicest out of the bunch, it still lacked any ummmppphhhhh.  I got into the GTO and whoa, talk about making your neck sore.   I wish more people would just test drive it.  Realize it is NOT an American car and that it was built out of Holden in Australia who has a following of quality that is like the BMW and Hondas, just in a different country.   "
pontiac,gto,2006,Larry Lee, 01/26/2007,pontiac man,4,"I love driving this car.  The pure power of that LS2 is amazing.  I have been a pontiac man my whole life.  I have owned a 66 GTO, 71 GTO, 74 GTO and a number of Trans Ams including a 2002 Firehawk.  My 06 Goat has neck snapping power that is a joy to drive.  The interior is the best of any pontiacs I've owned.  I believe the exterior could be improved even though the sleeper look at times is beneficial.  I hope they bring the goat back.  I did have one problem which I learned about on other reviews.  The problem with the struts.  When I read there was problems I went out and checked my struts.  Sure enough the strut on the right side had blowen.  I took back to dealer and they fixed it."
pontiac,gto,2006,iblyth79, 02/02/2007,A bargain that will have you smiling,4,"I traded my well loved 2004 Grand Prix Comp G for a red-on-red GTO and the smile has never left my face and my kids for that matter. This car reinforced my faith in Pontiac and the company's ability to build exciting cars, even if it's underpinnings are Australian. I think the cars looks are great, the interior is well crafted especially for a 30K car and my car has been reliable. From a performance and driving perspective, I have not driven a better car. This is not luxury coupe loaded with all the ""bells and whistles"" but a back to basics muscle car with some refinement and I think this combination works. Turn the key, mash the pedal and steer; youll be amazed. I know I was. "
pontiac,gto,2006,Larry, 03/08/2007,Road Ripping Fun,5,"After a year and 12,000 miles in all weather conditions (Vermont), my red GTO still brings me smiles with every drive, a true pleasure.  I use it mostly for a 44 mile commute over a mixture of twisty secondary roads, city streets, and low traffic interstate.   A hoot to drive, the vehicle is well balanced with the tight crisp steering, firm handling and strong brakes expected on a 400 hp sports car.  Abundant power can smoke the tires with ease when the traction nanny is off.  At its selling price/performance point it is a bargain.  The 6 speed manual transmission allows excellent fuel economy.  I average 22 mpg commuting and 26+ on trips.  "
pontiac,gto,2006,Doug Myers, 05/15/2007,Truly Madly Deeply,5,"in love with GTO. Performance amazing, fit and finish perfect, interior appearance and quality excellent, understated external beauty, gas mileage very good for 400 HP and 400 lb/ft of torque, did need to upgrade stereo. That is my 2006 GTO experience. Do not test drive if you hope to sleep at night without owning one."
pontiac,gto,2006,Jeramy, 08/27/2007,"Nice car, but could be a great car",4,"I have had this car for over a year and love driving it.  Even with the problems I have had I would still buy the car again. The passenger door locks do not work occasionally, of course the dealership cannot duplicate.  Additionally, there is a constant noise from the drivetrain.  The dealership says it is functioning properly. I have owned an E36 M3 and this car almost competes, even considering the problems the dealership cannot fix.  For the money, no better car in this market.  I considered a low mileage E46 M3 and decided on the GTO due to the price differential."
pontiac,gto,2006,Dan, 09/09/2007,Best Car Ever,5,"My 2006 Pontiac GTO is my first new car. When I realized they were going to stop making then after 2006, I just had to have one. I ended up driving 6 hours to get the exact car I wanted. I drive the car everyday, and love every minute of it. I love having everyone comment on how much they like the car. This car is a steal at 30k.  If you can find a new one buy it, if not get what you can find on the used market.  The interior rivals many high end luxury cars, minus a few frills, and will run with just about any sports car.  I just wish I could buy another new one when this one is paid off."
pontiac,gto,2006,Darrell Burns, 06/11/2007,Does what a GTO should,4,"Kept driving past the dealer looking at it. Put off driving it for a couple of months, but after a test drive the car sold itself. The 2006 GTO is well styled, extremely solid, very comfortable, and handles smoothly. The interior is attractive, yet appropriate for a muscle car. I drive it daily, and the only negative aspect is fuel economy. I get 16.5 based on half highway, and half stop and go driving. As far as the small trunk goes, this car is built for driving, not utility.  "
pontiac,gto,2006,Ramdy Walker, 07/10/2007,"Head Turner, Tire Burner",4,"I was actually waiting on the new Camaro, but have been keeping my eye on the ""Goat"" since '04. When they came out with the hood scoop and the 6 liter LS2, I could no longer wait. Extremely pleased with my decision. The GTO drives like a more expensive sports car, runs like scared cat and is priced like a family car. I've had no problems, even though, I've heard about the front struts going bad. What I really like about this car is, it is a real sleeper. I enjoy being on the road with a car that is virtually unmatched by other cars in its class. I would highly recommend a GTO to all my Dodge and Ford friends."
pontiac,gto,2006,wahikan, 08/15/2007,Too new to know,4,"I just got the GTO, after 3 Bonneville's, the last was an SSEi. My GTO is smaller and has a few less gadgets, which I actually like having less of. This is my first true muscle car and my first new car. It's going to be interesting to see if a stick shift will become a pain, but for now it's fun. By owning the Bonnis I suspect bakes will become an issue but I'll offer a follow-up once I drive this puppy a little more. I plan to never ever sell this car. I'm hoping that because of the short life this latest genration of GTO will prove a good investment in 30 or so years... "
pontiac,gto,2006,GoaTlOver, 06/30/2007,Wow,4,"After spending 6 years in Italy, I was looking forward to buying a new Mustang. Boy, am I glad that I found a GTO still sitting on the new car lot in early 2007. This is an absolutely outstanding vehicle. The 6.0 and 6 speed tranny are a blast to use on a daily basis and they still get respectable mileage. I really can't believe that GM could not sell more of these. That's ok though, I got mine brand new and saved about $5000 off of the sticker price."
pontiac,gto,2006,Phil's06, 09/02/2007,True Sleeper!,4,After a test drive I had to have it! Smooth ride very fast and big leather seats!  I read a bunch of reviews on how this car is lacking well I have yet to see it that way.  I have had my GTO for over 5 months now and still puts a smile on my face every time I turn the key. This is truly a sleeper and rare car on the street.  So much power that makes a ford owner jelious!
pontiac,gto,2006,Meti, 09/07/2007,Mustangs? Where?,4,"Its just nice to be one of the owners here. I love this car to death and anyone can talk smack but for $29k I think it's worth every cent.  I drove it from Lansing, MI to Miami Beach, FL. This was a good ride fully loaded. That is 4 ppl with full truck and even back seat floor with bags. Rear fender was covering tire more than 1 inch. Lovely car."
pontiac,gto,2006,fred, 10/28/2007,Big fun,4,"I have owned many 60s and 70s muscle cars over the years, and bought 2 5.0 Mustangs new and this car is by far the fastest in stock trim. With only 1000 miles on the 06 GTO I went to the drag strip. It went 13.40s at 103.70 in the quarter mile, completely showroom stock. It gets almost 20 mpg avg and I drive 95 miles round trip to work daily. 7500 miles and not a problem."
pontiac,gto,2006,Parrymax, 10/30/2007,Some fun!,4,Fun to drive very responsive. The motor pulls like it's nobody's bussiness. And it has a great sound.
pontiac,gto,2006,Charles Goin, 11/29/2007,Love my 06 and my previous 04,4,"Loved my 04 enough to buy an 06 both Blue with Blue interior. Absolutely love the car. The interior is my favorite. It's like a cockpit very well executed as well. As for ""ugly"" I like the smooth euro look.. It was not discontinued due to poor sales.The platform is was built on (The Holden Commodore Sedan) was slated for replacement in 2006 before the first GTO hit the US. It was going to be built for 3 years to fill the gap between the Trans AM and Soltice.. Which it did excellently."
pontiac,gto,2006,BigUnit42, 03/05/2008,Unleash The Beast,4,"Unlike many who own a GTO, mine is a daily driver. My commute is 35 miles one way. In addition to that I take it out often on social occasions. Needless to say I spend a great amount of time in this vehicle.  This is the best sports car you can buy for the price. The performance is immaculate, and a year and a half after purchase, it still surprises me. Another surprise was the quality of the interior. Leather all around, comfortable electronic seats, and a stylish dashboard. No part of the interior looks cheap or plastic- looking like many cars today. Gas mileage is low for current standards, but for the size of the engine, it can be preserved quite well if driven conservatively."

pontiac,gto,2006,timbercd32, 03/23/2008,The real goat !,4,I have had a many muscle cars in my years even some of the real 'bad boys'.  I sold my Vette to buy it and love it. This car is amazing!  Floor it and watch the tach rev up and when it changes gears the rear end twitches to the left..Raw HP !!  What other cars on the market can you buy stock..that will do that. In the old days the cars screamed the tires after you installed a shift kit..06 GTO does it stock!  It's an awesome car and rides great on long trips. No road noise and great looks.  You don't see them everywhere like you do so many other cars. Sadly I just sold it because of two reasons..I need a 4 door and better gas mileage.
pontiac,gto,2006,john32348, 03/29/2008,The rear end,4,"This is a totally mean machine. Power beyond belief. My only complaint is the rear end alignment. It really wears tires out fast. After months in an out of the shop, and finally changing one part, it still is 15% out of aliment. When we finally got someone from  gm to talk to us, their only reply was good luck. The tech who work on this problem said that gm has a bad problem. They just need to admit it, and take care of it."
pontiac,gto,2006,MJ, 04/20/2008,Mod,4,"I have mainly great reviews for my GTO.  I had strut issues at first with poor dealer support.  I recently added the pedders x-treme pro suspension package, new clutch and twin 400 hp turbos.  We are working out some bugs with the system but all I have to say at this point is I may need to add wings and a parachute.  It's a BEAST."
pontiac,gto,2006,Kevin, 05/22/2008,Orange GTO,4,"Very nice ride which offers comfort and performance.  Fun to drive and lots of second looks from car enthusiasts.  Suspension is well tuned.  Huge brakes are an advantage when you are thrusting 400 HP around.  Style is good  but could have been a little better when compared to some of the alternative vehicles but once you sit in this car and feel the thunder underneath and accessibility of controls you will be hooked.  This car blows away my Z-28s and Formula Firebirds not to mention the Ford Mustangs encountered.  Hope to see the GTO return.  Early rumors indicate that it will be reproduced on the Australian Z body platform as will Camaro.  GTO, fuel for the soul."

The seats are the most comfortable seats I've sat in. The sound system is very good, but it would have been nice to have an auxiliary plug for an I-Pod. The craftsmanship on this car is outstanding! The 6 speed shifter had a longer throw than I liked, but after I installed a B&M Short shifter it performs extremely well. I love the ""Spice Red"" paint on mine. I wouldn't trade this car for anything!"

Just do your regular maintenance on this car and it will serve you well.

So far this van has lived in Toronto, Edmonton and Vancouver.

I'm upgrading to 2003 Pontiac Montana Thunder as it has many improvements over the previous models. AWD and independent suspension are just two of the many features.

If you are looking for a good, reliable and enjoyable vehicle to own, look no further; there simply is no better option given their cost."

There are a few issues, Gas Gauge is not working properly, Passenger side sliding door motor does not work, you can hear it click but never engages. Other than that.. It's roomy, engine and transmission still feel very strong and smooth at 187K miles and overall I am very happy with the purchase. I'll update this once I get my front end looked at and find out what the cost of getting the ride a bit smoother is and if any new bugs pop up but so far, good buy!"

The versatility is what still amazes me. We pop out the seats to take it trout fishing, biking, or to pick up a new appliance. We can take the whole family to dinner - 2 car seats and 4 grown ups. Elderly parents have no problem getting into the seats. My work for a nonprofit clothing closet is a breeze with hanging space for a full rack of clothes. The traction control feature keeps me on the road in Michigan winters. Fold the 3rd row seating and a large dog rides very comfortably. Sport suspension makes this van fun to drive. It is easy to maneuver into tight parking spots."

I went through 3 belts and tensioners before my current machanic found the issue.  We drove two cross country trips, and had a great time. I love the power sliding door! The rear cargo space. The sound system is still bursting ear drums. I wish I weren't so envriomently involved. I need to get better EPA ratings. I am going to try to sell it in the next 3 to 6 months.

If your Montana is overheating, without getting oil in your antifreeze, and antifeeze is being pushed out of your holding tank it's the head gasket. I learned that the hard/expensive way. Currently has 151,000 miles hope it gives me plenty more."
pontiac,montana,2000,Soccer Dad, 07/21/2002,Could be better,4,"We have had six warranty repairs. This 
entailed being without a car or waiting 
at the dealer to have it repaired. 1. 
Starter 2. Battery 3. Right  front CV 
joint 4. Altenator repair 5. Pull down 
Strap replacement on rear hatch 6. 
Intake manifold gasket for oil leak. In 
addition to the warranty repairs we 
replaced the Dunlap tires, lasting only 
22,000 miles due to one having a 
defect. Replaced brakes at 34,500 
miles. Speakers vibrate."
pontiac,montana,2000,boblaca, 08/15/2002,A nice car,5,"My ex worked for Toyota, so I drove new Toyotas for years.  I was leary of a 
GM product, but it has been great.  I had one problem with the fuel pump - it 
was towed for free and I was supplied with a free loaner under the warranty - I 
am somewhat baffled by the complaints I see.  The cup holders aren't great, 
but that isn't how I evaluate a car.  The tires are about shot after 27K - 
maybe I should have rotated them once or twice.  Duh."
pontiac,montana,2000,gmcman97, 03/05/2012,just okay,3,"had a lot of problems for the first 3 years
some were fixed before warranty ran out
had to threaten to sue for after warranty problems but settled out of court for extended warranty (7 yrs. 84,000 miles)
have not had anything serious go wrong since it became completely out of warranty
the usual tire wear, battery, water pump, alternator etc."
pontiac,montana,2000,Sickofpayinmechanic, 11/15/2008,Wish I would've reviewed before buying lemon,2,"Bought in May 05. June it left us stranded 6 hours from home on a Sunday! Back to dealership, couldn't diagnose till they drove it around for a week and got stranded themselves only to find a loose wiring harness in the fuel line. By December had a $700 tranny rebuilt, 3 sets of rotors, brakes every couple months, but only on one side? Front bearings. Oh yea then the gasket went for a price tag of $1000 (and still smells of antifreeze when warm). Rear door leaks through the interior light while raining! Cruise control just stopped working. Power windows are a joke! I know 5 different familys with these and I have the fewest probems with 152,000 miles and still shimmyin down the road!!"
pontiac,montana,2000,Father of 5, 04/15/2010,Wouldn't do It Again,2,"Well, for those of you who care, here is a rare opportunity to get some more feedback on this vehicle roughly 5 years after the original post.  My Montana is now 10 years old and now has 176K miles on it.  I think the repair track record (in addition to the normal stuff) speaks for itself:  1. Head gasket ~ $1,500 2. Failed water pump 3. Engine will intermittently rev high and only returns to normal after the engine is shut off and restarted. 4. Driver side sliding door literally fell off  failed weld on the main bearing assembly 5. Interior ceiling trim around driver side sliding door fell off.  (Held on by double-sided sticky tape) 6. Passenger side sliding door motor failed closed"
pontiac,montana,2000,Father of 5, 04/15/2010,Wouldn't Do It Again (continued),2,"I made the decision to never buy a GM vehicle again in 2005.  In that same year, my other vehicle was hit and we used the insurance money to buy a used 1992 Acura Vigor.  That vehicle now has 250K miles on it and is just now starting to wear out.   In the five years Ive owned it, Ive put 130K miles on it and never had to do anything but routine maintenance.   In my view, its too bad that bankruptcy didnt end in GMs total elimination from the market.  Ive driven their cars for 25+ years, waiting for them to improve the quality of their product to something acceptable and it hasnt happened.  The cars they made back then had nothing but electrical problems and the same is still true"
pontiac,montana,2000,Poor quality, 10/23/2007,Reliable as a Model T,2,"First thing the car did was the breaking and snapping off of the plastic parts inside the car. Cupholders, knobs, ect. Then the tail and brake lights. They don't just burn out, they fuse (melt) to the plastic tail lamps. This happens every 10,000 mi or so. Did I mention oil consumption? How about a quart every 2,000 mi. The electric rear windows leak also. That's why there is huge stain on the rear carpet. A nice rusty color to boot. The radiator began overheating too (83,000 mi). When the van is started warm or cold, it likes to rev to 1500 rpm, so you have to turn it off and restart till it stays at 800 rpm. A mind of it's own for sure. Will be buying anything but this, next time around"
pontiac,montana,2000,mike, 06/07/2008,It's a shame,2,"My wife and I bought this vehicle used, 3y rs old, 34,000 miles. We LOVED the bells and whistles that the vehicle is equipped with. It drives, rides and handles like a dream. Unfortunately, that's where the love affair ends. The design and build quality of this van is simply appalling. This vehicle should have been recalled early on. The fact that it hasn't, speaks VOLUMES about GM's attitude toward customer satisfaction. If you ever wondered why the Japanese car companies are killing American auto makers, you need look no further than this vehicle. The cheap quality of interior parts is only surpassed by the $1500  repair bill every 2-6 months when yet another sys/component fails."
pontiac,montana,2000,Dave, 06/15/2008,Should Come With 10 Year Warranty,3,"Roomy interior, comfortable seating and reasonably economic to operate (17 mpg city/24 mpg hwy). Now for the rest of the story.  Have had to replace the intake gaskets twice (once under warranty and once out of my pocket) in less than 50K miles. Handles like a Hippo on roller skates. Worst headlights of any car I've ever driven. A/C is week. GM must have bought the interior materials on closeout from Big Lots. Will likely NEVER buy another GM product. Should have paid the extra $ and bought the Toyota Sienna. Wife no longer trusts it enough to take it out of town. "
pontiac,montana,2000,water well owner, 07/12/2008,Happy Montana Owner,4,"Bought this van nearly 8 years ago after driving most other domestic vans.  This one by far the best!  Have over 196,000 miles on it and still love it!  Have been looking around at something to replace it, but can't find anything that is as roomy or has the big comfy seats.  This has been such a great vehicle, we're spoiled and can't find anything that is worth replacing it with."
pontiac,montana,2000,traveler, 05/09/2002,like it...but,3,"The general tires suck...34,000 miles 
and I already need new set.  Rack & 
pinion is being replaced due to a leak 
also.
Like the styling overall, but the 
uneven floor creates loading problems; 
everything slides or and tips forward."
pontiac,montana,2000,kat83704, 01/07/2009,Loved It,4,"This was the best minivan I have ever owned. I never had any problems with it and it was very reliable transportation. I had two children that were in car seats when this van was purchased, so the dual sliding doors came in very handy.  "
pontiac,montana,2000,justducky150, 01/08/2008,Standard GM quality,3,"This has been a wonderful family vehicle.  We bought with 29K in 2002 for $18M.  Fully loaded w/o DVD and 100K/6yr warranty for $2K, great value by the way, after all its a GM.  Standard accoutrements are excellent.  The leather, rear air/rear sound, automatic sliding door, quad seating are all you can ask for unless you appreciate listless children drooling over the most recent Disney DVD. We love this vehicle and wish GM wasn't leaving the utilitarian minivan market. Crossovers don't offer the room and the Suburban is too big. We're going foriegn due to GM's shortsightedness and lack of caring for the family utility vehicle...the mini-van. God rest its soul.  Marketing sure led to its demise."
pontiac,montana,2000,victorc, 06/06/2002,favorable and would do it again,4,"i love this car.  I have had no

problem was a misaligned hood latch and 
a flimsy cup holder."
pontiac,montana,2000,Minivan Mom, 07/11/2002,Little flaws that drive me crazy!,3,"We take our Montana back to the 
dealership to fix something once 
every two months.  I've had old junkers 
that have needed less service!  In the 
first year, it was recalled 5 times - 
twice for the automatic door, twice for 
the rear seatbelt and once for the 
GPS.  The little things drive me crazy -
 broken drink holder,burnt out light in 
the radio, airbag light that keeps 
coming on, oil change indicator that 
won't turn off, module for headsets 
that comes completely out of the 
counsel when you remove the headset, 
broken strap for the rear hatch etc.  
I've always owned Toyotas and I think 
I'll go back after this vehicle."

Montana.  Fun to drive and hauls a lot 
of people/cargo."
pontiac,montana,2000,rooster, 08/03/2002,Ready to trade,3,"We have had it in the shop five times 
since we bought it.  Twice for the van 
not starting (both times had to have it 
towed), twice for power sliding door 
problems (recall opener, then a short 
in wiring), once for shorted coolent 
sensor.

If not for the reliability problems, we 
like the van."
pontiac,montana,2000,minivanmama, 08/10/2002,outstanding minivan,5,"Had this van for 2 years and I still 
love it.  It is fun to drive.  The 
Montana has a very powerful engine and 
it rides smooth.  I think this van is 
the coolest of all vans.  It is really 
sporty looking.  The only problem so 
far is the oil change light won't go 
out.  I have the 7 seater but should've 
went for the 8 seater."
pontiac,montana,2000,Bryan Wisconsin, 09/12/2002,Indifferent,3,"First of all, we like it because of the 
distinctive styling.  Everyone we know 
has a Caravan and we wanted to be 
different.  The Caravans were nice and 
truly Chrysler did ""think of 
everything"".  However, the power of the 
Montana is much better.  Highway speeds 
are very manageable and comfortable.  
My biggest problem is the workmanship.  
Sunglass Holder, Cig Lighter 
compartment, etc.  Also, tires have 37K 
miles and they need to be replaced.  
They are cupped.  I'll be happy when I 
have new ones.  It has been in the shop

the LONG list of recalls and problems 
until I searched online.  Wind noise is 
terrible.  Driver's side sliding door

pontiac,montana,2000,S. Byrne, 02/10/2005,Disappointed Owner,4,"Love the ride and comfort and handling, but turned off on GM after other experiences, including broken fold-down cupholder; brakepad loss resulting in grinding of rotors in second year of ownership (GM did pay, although out of warranty); erratic fuel sensor, service engine soon light, change oil light, and overhead displays; flickering lighting, including headlights; sludge in coolant; air conditioner replacement at a cost of nearly $600 at 75,000; excessive oil usage.  Dealer turns a deaf ear, while a call to GM was no better--gentleman I spoke with indicated that 95,000 was a good excuse for oil usage.  My comment to him was that he was indicating that the life of the vehicle was 100,000!"
pontiac,montana,2000,Dr. RWK, 04/09/2005,Underrated!!!,5,"No problems here!  Cannot understand why this car is not highly rated.  Handles well, very quiet, adequate power, smooth ride.  No problems in 60,000 miles.  Normally would be trading about now, but we will be keeping for a while.  Best van we have owned."
pontiac,montana,2000,F. Mauritz, 11/29/2003,Money hungry Montana,4,"My Montana has been a big 
disappointment.  The electronics that 
drive the transmission shift mechanism 
were a constant problem during the 
first year.  The electronic ""brain"" 
made some very hard shifts on a couple 
of occasions before a new circuit 
board was put in.  The transmission 
shelled out just after the warranty 
ran out and I suspect the hard shifts 
contributed to the breakdown.

It has spent a lot of time in the shop 
for minor fixes that stem from poor 
factory workmanship.  This is my last 
Montana and probably by last Pontiac."
pontiac,montana,2000,Father of 5, 06/29/2005,Wouldn't Do It Again,2,"I had expected better from a 2000 model GM vehicle.  I began having electrical problems right after the warranty ran out, smelling smoke while I was driving and tracing the problem to a 24 V DC short in a connector in the interior driver side rear panel.  The wiring bundle was so hot that it melted the insulation on the wires.  This resulted in damage to the tail/brake light, automatic leveling and interior air compressor circuits.  Now, after roughly 65K miles, the transmission has started to go out.  This is a family vehicle that I needed to last for many years.  As it is, I will likely get it paid off in time to junk it.  Next time, I'll buy Japanese."

Ever since then it's been downhill. The transmission has gone out. oxygen sensors have had to been replaced. Basically everything you can imagine, happened to this van. The cup holders stink, they don't keep anything in place. The interior is built poorly. The bright red dash display is very annoying, why couldn't have it been blue? Why do you have to manually recline the seats? This van stinks."

pontiac,montana,2000,NJ Montana owner, 03/25/2004,Beware of sliding door falling off!!,3,"I've had this van for 3 1/2 yrs, 36k. 
No major problems until the driver's 
side sliding door fell right off as I 
went to close it. It was night time and 
20 degress and I had a door in my hand. 
The dealership states the problem was 
due to excessive rust on the rollers 
causing rollers and hinge to break . GM 
states it was our fault because we 
didn't maintain our doors by having 
them lubricated every 15k. I have never 
heard of doors falling off because of 
lack of lubrication and I don't think a 
3 1/2 yr old van should have excessive 
rust. This was a regular slider (non-
powered) If anyone else has encountered 
this problem, please post it.  "
pontiac,montana,2000,Montana Fan, 04/30/2004,Great Van,4,"With over 100,000 miles, I have had 
remarkably few problems with the van,

Engine and transmission have been very 
reliable. I average 24 mpg! I dislike 
the cupholder arrangement (not 
practical), but love the variety of 
seating arrangements and the ease of 
reconfiguring. It ez to drive and park

started.  Power sliding door opened 
while vehicle in motion!  Fixed by 
recall, but then 2 months later same 
problem, dealer wanted us to pay for 
repair!  Raised heck and GM covered 
it.  Intermitent electrical faults.  
Consumed 2 quarts oil per 3,000 miles;  
GM says this is ""normal"" consumption.  
Then I found oil in the coolant;  
discovered this is a cronic problem

drivers seat quit working again at 
45,000 miles. Will cost to much to fix.
The General XP2000 self sealing tires 
rode a little rough and didn't wear 
very well. My Caprice with a 305 V-8

handle on rear hatch broke at 40,000."
pontiac,montana,2000,Snowbird, 08/05/2005,A Winner in my Book!,4,"I purchased this vehicle used and was delighted with it. Not only was the ride comfortable (2 trips to Florida from New Jersey in 2 years) but the fuel economy was great for a 6 cylinder engine (27 mpg on the FL trips). Plenty of room. My only complaints were the air conditioning (it rarely ever got cool enough) and the middle seat removal latches. Both were difficult to operate and one actually broke. Other than that, it was a great car. Seat belt restraints and air bag saved my life in a recent accident that totalled the vehicle."
pontiac,montana,2000,Bub, 09/17/2005,Really an OK car for the money.,3,"I bought this car new because my mom was stuck with a GM credit.. otherwise would have bought a Sienna.  However, the Montana was $5K cheaper (although now it's payback time - no resale).  It has really been surprisingly dependable - little stuff (fuel pump under warranty, power window switch, currently at 75K the fuel gauge and cruise control are out) but it has been overall quite dependable.  Average gas mileage (17-24), loads of power, and really handles well now that I have switched to 235/60-15 tires - you've simply got to do that.  Turns it from wallowing pig to confidence inspiring sport-minivan.  Air Conditioning is marginal - you might want to get the dual AC.  Seats - barely  OK."
pontiac,montana,2000,Jeff, 01/15/2006,Montana - spacious and economical,4,"Ownership of the Montana has been a pleasure.  The video system helped keep our two kids busy when we drove to Yellowstone and back to Pennsylvania and later to southern Florida and back, along with trips to Massachusetts and back in between.  The system takes both vhs video tapes and video game inputs.  On these long trips I found the gas milage was better than expected as the most recent trip to Florida gave me at least 27 to close to 30 mpg on the highway.  The digital information system helps when put on instantaneous mpg, one learns what helps and what hurts as far as gas milage goes.  The vehicle has given us no major engine problems, is good on tire wear and the exterior is still good."
pontiac,montana,2000,UGH, 07/19/2006,My 6th new GM vehicle and my LAST,2,"The transmission failed at 58,000 miles. Dealer wanted $5000 for repair.

At 75,000 miles the new Orange Anti Freeze coolant ate thru some gaskets. I got to dig out my wallet again.Over $1000 for this one. The fuel gauge has not worked for thousands of miles, the dealer can fix me up for under $800 by replacing something in the fuel tank. No thanks, I will just keep the tank full. The power windows fail periodically, but reset themselves, must be a heat thing. Fortunately the dealer only charges me $30 when I bring it in for repair estimates."
pontiac,montana,2000,gvbradt, 08/09/2006,Pontiac Montana 2000,4,"After 6 six years, I really still love this van.  I have 6 buckets seats so everyone has their own space and the seats are so comfortable.  It still looks ""new"", not an outdated design.  Great for piling in the kids and going somewhere and not having to worry about getting anything."
pontiac,montana,2000,ron, 12/08/2006,good montana,5,"My montana has been very reliable since my original purchase,new.The most major problems were, replacing the steering box , and replacing the rear air shocks. It's been a good vehicle."
pontiac,montana,2000,tricanis, 12/25/2006,Montana,1,A shame that GM cannot make a more reliable vehicle!  This would have been a great vehicle had we not had to take it to the service department once every other month.  On average for 7 years of ownership I spent $650 per year out of pocket in repair costs.  I had over $ 4500 in receipts that I turned in when I got ride of the montana.  Yes....We purchased a Odyssey.  
pontiac,montana,2000,Kevin Nadai, 04/01/2003,Never again,3,"From day one we had little bits of 
interior pieces break and/or fall off.

Powertrain warranty only 36 months.  
Transmission destroyed itself at 42,000 
miles.  Very poor customer service and 
support.  Even though Pontiac admitted 
the failure was ""unusual"" and NOT 
related to abuse or maintenance, it 
still took over six months to receive 
any compensation from Pontiac in the 
form of 60% of the cost of the repair."
pontiac,montana,2000,not that bad, 03/09/2007,not that bad,3,"Yes, this van and the other two from GM have had problems, but how many folks have heard of PREVENTATIVE maintenance? Our van has been very reliable, except for the intake gaskets that I had to replace. Otherwise, at 100k it still runs and rides pretty good. Love the room, and we use this as our truck at times as well. I do wish they had better resale. Mine is 100% mechanically, and still worth peanuts. Power sliding door needs to be reset from time to time, but other than normal care, it has been a good van"
pontiac,montana,2000,Band Mom, 04/11/2003,Electrical problems,3,"I have enjoyed this van EXCEPT for an 
ongoing electrical prroblem. I have had 
the van ffor 40,000 miles and I have 
had to have 3 electrical system repairs 
done. The cruise control keeps going 
out and then the brake lights go out. I 
am told that GM has a tangled mess of 
wiring in the stering column and it is 
a difficult repair to make and really 
get all the wires connected and keep 
them connected wwhile you put it back 
together."
pontiac,montana,2000,mlk, 05/02/2007,Problems,2,"Very pleased with the ride and handling. Problems with rear air, blows hot air even though it has been repaired several times.  Low coolant level all the time, mechanic said I need to replace the vehicle soon becuase the coolant is leaking into the engine oil. Constant problems with the power sliding door - sticks open often, don't use it anymore. Great interior, still looks like new but cupholders broke soon after purchase- flimsy and ill placed. Driver side heated seats went out soon after warranty expired. Love the red lighted dash lighting. CD player gets very hot. Great with winter starting.  "

pontiac,montana,2000,pugowner19, 11/12/2007,My Great Van,4,I bought this about 2 years ago. I love the way it look. We have had very little trouble with it. It has all the bells and whistles you could ask for. The body style is still in style after all this time. I think that if the transmission or engine went out I would just have them replaced and keep the van.
pontiac,montana,2000,montanajoke, 11/24/2007,why buy a lemon?,2,"I would not give anyone a plug nickle for one of these albatros of a ""truck"" Funny, they clasify this as a truck, and nothing is farther from the truth.GM should be ashamed for offering such a poor excuse for a minivan, and I am not surprised there is a lawsuit regarding the lower intake gasket. If they had any sack they would pony up and refund everyone $1000, which would be about 8 out of 10 owners, and they knew of the problem for years. The resale value is laughable. I have had 3 intake gaskets done and is leaking again. I would not advise my worst enemy to buy this boat anchor. Not too mention the small but numerous problems that have plauged our van from day one. "

we had a number of nagging problems 
around 35000 miles this has been a 
great van. More cargo space than any of 
the others. We plan to replace this van 
with another Montana in the next few 
years. My wife has just fallen in love 
with it. We have driven the Toyota and 
the Ford and the Chrysler/Dodge ones

are as good as her Montana."
pontiac,montana,2000,jpollock, 03/17/2008,More Good Than Bad,3,"I purchased this 2000 Pontiac Montana new. Features power sliding door, climate control, power seats, etc. Payed $32k new for it, not worth that much, maybe close to $20k. All GM's vans had problems, this is by far the best out of the three though. There are about 127k miles on it now, its still running ok, but needs new head gaskets soon, so will be trading in shortly. For the most part the quad seating and roomy interior was a great van for a family of four and the dog!"
pontiac,montana,2000,160,000 MIles Traded,"160,000 miles traded",3,"Well we got over 160,000 miles out of the van.  For the most part it has been fairly reliable, but it has many major design flaws that result in failures that you will have to fix (valve seal gaskets - $800 to $1,000; Front wheel bearings - $600; Transmission - $1500 TO $2000).  The radio lights and gas gauge have not worked for years.  We got $1250 for a trade-in, so if you buy one, you should plan on driving it into the ground."
pontiac,montana,2000,Brett, 03/27/2008,Every car bought has a story to tell,4,"I bought this van used, it already had sixty thousand miles on it. Myself have put over another one hundred thousand miles. Its been the best vehicle Ive ever owned. The car history report was clean when I bought it, still is today. No lie, the van runs like its new still to this day. However there is some minor issues that I think are small. The gas needle reads full all the time, It leeks dexacool, very small amount. My light comes on maybe once a month. I had to replace a fog light, and a head light. That's it, I live up in the mountains of western Maryland and my van will fly up these hills like there nothing. Then again it should with a 3.4L V6! "
pontiac,montana,2000,Worst Buy Ever!, 04/28/2008,GM -Generates Maintenance,2,"Worst vehicle I ever bought. Also have the revving problem. Coolant leaking into the cylinders for quite some time but just letting it go to squeeze the last few miles out of this.  Electrical problems since new, hooking up to computer does not tell mechs what is wrong. Front windows both not working!Replaced steering, ignition,headlamp switch, fuel system (2 x). Replaced cup holders under warranty several times and now all broken. Do not close rear hatch with handle because I know it will break. Sliding door serviced 5 separate times. Replaces generator. Bought this for 30K. have spent another 5K.  No wonder GM is having problems! Go spend time with Japanese to find out how to make cars!"

pontiac,montana,2000,Foolish GM customer, 10/31/2020,Theres 100s of fish in the sea,2,"If you buy this vehicle, you WILL have to fix things. its a guarantee. General motors made a average car not meant to go over 150k miles. I Have replaced the starter motor, radiator, water pump, fuel pump, camshaft sensor. And now my head gasket has gone. From 162k- 172k miles, that was the maintenance list. Another annoyance is where things are situated in the engine bay. A thermostat replacement will take 3 hours. Anyways, buy something else.
"
pontiac,montana,2001,Darla, 09/25/2010,Time for another vehicle,3,"I bought my mini-van in 2006, and it had 95,000 miles on it. For the first two years, it did great. I took it on vacations with no problems whatsoever. And the best part was that there was plenty of room for everyone. In 2008, I had to replace the head gasket and intake gaskets. It had been overheating. That's been the biggest expense. Recently, at 165,000 miles I've noticed that if I turn the AC on for long periods of time when driving, it tends to run hot. I have not let it overheat, but it does run hot. I'm also noticing the transmission is sticking. The power sliding door has a mind of its own, sometimes works and sometimes not. "
pontiac,montana,2001,Tom Gettman, 07/22/2016,Runs great for all the abuse I give it!,5,"I bought this van 1 1/2 years ago with 112000 miles. I now have just over 170000 miles. I drive 170 to 200 miles per day. this van has never let me down. Only issue is that it has gone thru a couple of front wheel hubs. This van has never left me stranded.
"
pontiac,montana,2001,Dan_golfer, 03/04/2002,Nice design but poor quality,3,"We like the performance of the van. But we do not like the braking.  The pedal feels like it goes to the floor and the van takes forever to stop.

Original tires only last 20,000 miles or less. We have had numerous repairs like: Air conditioner, Torque converter, Intake manifold gasket, power door, computer replaced, stereo replaced, and worn out brake rotors after only 40,000 miles.

Make sure you buy the extended warranty, because I think you will need it."
pontiac,montana,2001,Demers Family, 01/28/2006,Major Gremlins,4,"We loved the gas mileage this van got, and the space and comfort was superb, as was the interior configuration. However since we bought it used it had no manufacture warranty, nor dealer warranty. The summer of 2004 the a/c went out, we spent $700 on trying to get it fixed, they thought they fixed it, it died again the next day. Then the bearings went out, and both sets of brakes as well as all the shocks and struts. We only put 25,000 miles on it when we owned it. We put $1000 into it, not counting the a/c and it still needed $1800 worth of work, and two car shops later the a/c problem still could NOT be solved! We traded it for an SUV, it is a sad loss we loved our van greatly. "

pontiac,montana,2001,Julie, 09/22/2009,Awesome Family Vehicle,4,"We bought our Montana because we has small children and wanted the convenience of the back seat access for car seats.  It has been a wonderful van for us.  Love the easy cleanability of the leather seats, the access to rear seats, the ease of lowering the back seat for more cargo space.  We have had no major repairs.  We have taken good care of our van and had regular maintenance, which makes a world of difference. All mechanical systems still working great.   It's a comfortable van, easy to drive and great for families. "
pontiac,montana,2001,jon, 01/08/2005,too many flaws,3,"This van was ok until 30,000 miles when the general self sealing tires were bald.Yes I rotated them every 6000 miles. The intake gasket had to be replaced at 31,000. The brakes were sticking on one side at 37,000. Airbag light came on at 40,000 and has been back twice for that. The battery had to be replaced at 47,000. Now the abs,traction control lights are coming on. GM needs to recall the intake gaskets everyone I know with a montana has had it replaced. I love gm trucks but this the last van GM will sell me."
pontiac,montana,2001,Laura, 05/30/2007,Major cooling system problems,3,"As soon as this vehicle passed 60k miles it was all downhill. It is a sqeeky, noisy ride. Our fuel gauge went out and we are just waiting for the fuel pump to die, too. We have had problems with the cooling system and have twice replaced the water pump, the thermostat, the intake valve and are about to shell out more money for what remains to be determined. I won't be buying or recommending a GM product to anyone in the ever near future. For all of the people that ranked their vehicle so favorably when it was only 2 to 3 years old, I'd be curious to see how their ""later years"" have panned out.  "

We got an excellent deal on it and soon discovered it was from a bad odor. After cleaning it several times, we still haven't enjoyed the new car smell, but we have gotten a sweet deal! It has been paid for for 2 years now and until this week, I have only needed regular oil changes, new tires and windshield wipers. Yesterday I spent $600 to replace the rear brake cylinders and the front bushings. The boys are grown and I could sell and get a convertible I have dreamed of for years, but I will drive this Beauty until she can't go anymore. "
pontiac,montana,2001,S James, 11/12/2008,Never Again,2,"OK, I was smitten by it's good looks for a mini van. What a pig it turned out to be. I have sworn off any GM built vehicle for as long as I drive. (And I control the fleet at my work) Read each of the posts and I have had the problem. Fuel tank sending unit made the gas gauge quit. Head gasket blew out. A/C out (twice) Windshield wipers nesting in the ""touchdown"" position.  My wife drove it that way for a month because two of our neighbors were having the same problem at the same time. (It was comical) GM dealers are lame. Could be the corporate policies. Still, they give you no reason to want to even look at another vehicle built by them. I give them less than 10 years."

No major repairs and have avoided the head gasket issue.  The intake manifold gaskets had been done before we bought it.  Basically just routine maintenance (brakes, wheel bearings in front, tires).  It's not as tight as a Honda or Toyota, but that's a given so don't expect it to be since you're paying thousands less for a comparable year. Fuel mileage is very good for a van (20-24mpg depending on season)."

We had some minor AC issues at 75,00 K and had to have the head gaskets and heads redone at 120,00 Wife drove it and it got hot. That cost around 2,000.

the culprit.  Hard shifting and 
unreliable performance from the

It seems hard on tires and front rotors. I've had to replace the heater elements in the front seats. The gas gauge quit working. I sometimes tow a 3000 pound trailer. The drivetrain still seems rock solid the engine doesn't use any oil and the transmission works well. I would buy another now that the intake gasket problems are sorted out."
pontiac,montana,2001,chuckb, 05/06/2007,Forced me into the arms of Toyota,4,"This was our second Montana. Had a 1999 that my wife totaled. The reliability on the '99 was spotty,but this one has been terrible. A/C condenser replaced twice, automatic headlights that won't go off, problems with traction control, leaking intake manifold gaskets. Finally at 58,000 miles the transmission went. Repair costs of $1800. Long letter and phone calls to GM result in sympathetic phone calls back, but no real response or reimbursement. Finally replaced this van after only 3 yrs and 60000 miles. My predicition? GM will be out of business within 20 yrs."

Has been reliable and smooth running up until replacing intake manifold gasket at 60,000 miles due to dry rot.  A $790+ repair cost that I  contacted Pontiac about and was reimbursed 50% of the cost. Recently, my glove box door fell off due to  plastic ""hinge"" breaking. The fold-down rear seat plastic hinge looks like it will be next to go. When gasket was being replaced at local dealer, mechanic broke air box and it will have to be replaced. Also, having problem with an engine sensor that indicates a problem with 1 of 3 possibilities. Sorry that OnStar will no longer work after 12/07."

pontiac,montana,2002,Saaphiel, 09/02/2010,Designed to fail catastrophically,3,"For the longest time, the van seemed to be doing all right.  Certainly it was comfy to drive, mileage was great, but then things started breaking.  A/C, door seals, ABS light, headlights full of water after rain causing me to buy new halogen bulbs every month, various electrical gremlins.  The final nail in the coffin was the gaskets failing. Plenty of oil and plenty of coolant, suddenly mixed together then cooling and coagulating in the engine to a peanut butter like consistency.   It's being hauled to the auto wreckers this week.   Rather than throw the equivalent of a down payment on a new car at this miserable van to fix it, I bought a Toyota 4 Runner instead."
pontiac,montana,2002,Jim, 11/30/2008,Excellent Value - Great Used Car!,4,"I purchased my loaded Montana that was gently used by a retired couple. The car was showroom clean with about 27,000 miles. It currently just broke 80,000 miles (an average of 12k/year). The van has done everything I've asked it to do. It had industry/segment leading cargo capacity and volume at the time. Its driving dynamics are excellent for a van. It was much better than the previous generation Toyota Sienna we compared it to. I think it will bring me many years of reliable service. I plan to keep it until about 220,000 miles. Buy one of these severly depreciated vehicles at a fire sale price and you wont be disappointed. I've had minor problems not worth mentioning."

The mechanic bet us that if we diden't take it for an oil change every 10'000k it would die before 100'000k, suffice to say he owes use 4 dinners now.  All the interior instrumints are broken/ falling appart. The screne for the radio/ clock won't work. knobs on the rear fan speed fell off at 120'000k  but in the end people who buy vans really are not looking for anything that can get them and their cargo/ passengers from point A to point B, and this van is fantastic on it.

I love this van. I have driven 24,000 km in 5 months and have found this van very reliable and very economical. If doing highway driving and on cruise control have managed to get 1000 km to a full tank. I found it very spacious and have a double mattress in her. I have enjoyed driving her and found the captain's chairs very comfortable even when driving 800 km in a day. I wouldn't hesitate in recommending these vans. "
pontiac,montana,2002,Austin, 09/19/2009,I HATE IT!,1,"I co signed on it for a family member, they fell on hard times and I now make the payments. The van is a LEMON! I have had nothing but problems with the wipers freezing in mid air, intake gaskets, sounds like a freight train, Traction Control sounds like a dying animal, power doors don't work, it sways, and it's sluggish. It is a Beautiful looking van, but it can't be trusted. I have a special edition fully loaded but most of the features don't work. I have a 2005 Rendezvous which I really love. I will never take over payments for a family member again."

Tail-lights keep blowing, I'm told its the electrical system. Windshield wipers stop in the up position. Air-conditioning stopped working. exterior trim has fallen off. Auto-side mirrors don't work. I'm the only owner of this car and my kids say I drive like an old lady and I do a mix of highway and suburban driving - so I don't think it's me. I've kept up with regular maintenance but the cost of fixing this stuff again and again is becoming quite a burden"

I've had great luck with the Montana and never had any major problems with it except normal ware and tear. It runs constantly for 24 hous a day. It now has 159,789 mi on it and runs like brand new. It has plenty of room and is very very comfortable for seating of 6. The AWD system is exceptional.It goes through anything. If anyone needs to by a mini van, this is the one to buy! I would buy another one in a heartbeat with no question."

wonderful.  The seats are very easy to 
fold and flip up and even easier to 
remove and re-install.  I have the 
extended wheelbase model and the room 
behind the folding rear seat is 
excellent.  This van is well laid out 
and thoughfully designed for a busy 
family on the road.  I would recommend 
it to anyone who needs a lot of room

all the bells an whistles.  I didn't 
intend to spend quite as much as we did 
but 0% interest allowed us to get 
everything we wanted.  The seats are 
comfortable except the arm rest could 
be wider.  The kids love the DVD player 
and they no longer feel ""stuck"" in 
their car seats for the trip to 
grandmas'.  The ride is very smooth but 
we were driving a Blazer so the change 
is more noticable.  Almost bought a MPV 
but the seats were not as comfortable 
and we thought the extra space in the 
Montana could come in handy in certain 
situations.  I think we will keep this 
van for a long time."

say that this was my first choice but 
I am happy that I bought it.  This is 
the only van that still felt like 
driving a car.  I also like the rugged 
look.  The Honda was #1 but the mark 
up just wasnt worth it to me.  The 0% 
financing on the Montana didnt hurt.  
The van has run great and after all 
the reviews I read about the lack of 
engine power....I'm content and 
believe that its more than adequate.  
Get the extended warranty for peace of 
mind!"

hearing) Dealership replaced both. 7 
months later, the same thing happened

major repairs: engine head gasket, 
cooliing system(Condensor) and now ABS

repair."
pontiac,montana,2002,Feed up with GM, 10/15/2008,Feed up with GM lack of quality,3,"GM builds crap and wonders why they have problems.  Our van has been in the shop way too much for big items.  The van has 87,000 miles on it and we have to replace the whole gasket system and front wheel hub at 65,000 miles ($1,600 fix).  The battery has gone bad twice.  The DVD player barely works and the heated seats have been replaced twice and continue to short out.  Now the Fuel pump has gone bad at 87,000 miles another $1,000 fix.  This makes the little items like rubber stripping on the sliding doors falling off way to annoying.  Do not buy GM you will regret it.      "

It started with the rocker panels on both sided from wheel to wheel where rust was eating away. I spent $1,000 to have them replaced at a nearby body shop. Next, the windshield cracked. The folks replacing my windshield said it cracked due to the frame rusting and bubbling, creating pressure on the windshield and cracking it.  When I steam cleaned the carpet, rust comes up through the floor of the van.  I'm all for buying American made products, but after spending over $33,000 on this vehicle, I just can not afford to go out and buy another Pontiac. I'll look elsewhere."

It's handling is great.  I went from a Prizm to this and don't feel any difference from a manuverablity standpoint.  For as big as this is, that's saying something.

I love it."

nothing but praise for it so far.  As a 
mother who once swore she'd never drive 
a minivan, I have been pleasantly

the amount of options that this vehicle 
has.  The ride and feel of the vehicle 
was confortable and crisp.  The gas 
mileage was as good as the mileage we 
got in our '99 Bravada and this is a 
bigger vehicle.  I drove this vehicle 
all winter and NEVER felt it slip or 
mishandle.  I swapped the tires that 
came on the vehicle for Goodyear 
tires.  They are fantastic!
Ricardo Leamon of Cleveland Heights

Head gasket just went and I pretty sure it's going for scrap, as I'm not rich! I had better luck with my rusty 91 Astro. All it needed was a y pipe. I would have been better to go with a Ford Taurus wagon for the family, oh well live and learn. I always wanted a Pontiac ever since I was little cause I new they were built better and stronger than GM but now they're garbage and I will never buy Chevy or Pontiac again!"

It has lots of extras including OnStar but I don't use OnStar. Mine is not the extended version.  This vehicle is the perfect size.  Not too large and not too small.  It is the perfect height for getting into and out of.  My kids would rather I drive a Cadillac CTS but too bad. But anyway I have just had regular maintenance done and a few minor glitches which I had fixed at Firestone.  I have 90,750 miles on it now. Love this van.  Oh and it gets 23 mpg.

All around great vehicle but it has had rear end troubles at a cost of $16000. thankfully under warranty. Now the rear end has gone again. Should it diengage the awd when cornering, Don't know. But they will spend another $ 11000 to fix it under warranty. It runs good just makes a howling noise when turning.  I would buy one again."

flaws from factory(not a 
quality paint job) & front wiper system

suck.  Snow and ice accumulate where 
they are suppose to go down under the 
hood. Second:the heating system for 
the second row of seats is not good.  
If your third row is folded and tipped 
the 2nd row doesn't get much heat.  
The dome light blinds the person 
driving when turned on.   Rear wiper 
is great especially when you live on 
gravel, but they need to move the 
washer sprayer to the center of the

not comfortable even though it had more

pontiac,montana,2002,druck4, 08/07/2005,family van,4,"We love our 2002 Montana, Never had a problem since we purchased it. The fuel mileage is great, 28 miles per on a trip 19 around town. Traction control works great , seating is comfortable and roomy. The DVD and sound system makes you feel like you are in a theatre. AC works great and all controls are easy to access. The engine could use a few more H.P. but is still very strong for the size. Motor never skips a beat and the oil is always nice and clean. The van handles like a sports car with the upgraded suspension, haulin heavy loads with the air supported suspension is awsome the vans rear never sags at all. Back up sensors are great for people who don't know when to stop.   Super minivan!!!"
pontiac,montana,2002,Brian, 03/04/2006,Very happy,5,"This was a good looking, easy to drive van. Tons of room and very flexible seating setup."
pontiac,montana,2002,JohnB, 01/13/2007,A Minivan I'm not embarrased by,4,"My wife and I always vowed we would never buy a minivan,  however when our SUV was starting to die we couldn't deny the mileage advantages of a minivan. The Montana has been great, 2 tone black with leather, lots of options and fun to drive.  Plus it has been rock solid reliable."
pontiac,montana,2002,2 time montana_owner, 03/25/2003,Fairly happy.,3,"Owned a '99 Montana that I traded 
because I had the infamous head gasket 
leak at 82k miles that cost $1200 to 
fix. Pontiac ended up reimbursing me 
for the repair. I bought the '02 with 
an extended warranty, though."
pontiac,montana,2002,FamVan, 02/14/2007,"It's a FamVan, what can you expect...",4,I have been driving the 2002 Pontiac Montana for 4.5 years.  I made the purchase after renting a Montana for a road trip from Colorado to Florida in 2001.  It has been functional for my family and the kids have really enjoyed the MontanaVision.
pontiac,montana,2002,jalluv, 03/28/2003,Love the lemon?????,3,"Since we got this vehicle, we have had 
numerous problems:  The A/C was 
repaired 3 times, the passenger seat 
heater and rails needed replacing, the 
coil packs have been replaced 3 times, 
lug nut cover fell off, our tires are 
allegedly cupping and making a loud 
noise and now our AWD and ABS are 
disengaged for some reason and we have 
an appointment on Monday to find out 
once again what is wrong!  We like what 
this van has to offer but hate all the 
mechanical problems!"
pontiac,montana,2002,Cheryl, 04/22/2007,Minivan Madness,2,"I have owned this vehicle for 2 years and had the head gasket go at 39,000 miles. Heat always feels like it's on when it's not.  Backlit sometimes stays off. Headlights dim slightly on and off when driving at times. Would not recommend this van to anyone, I would not buy one again. Beware before you buy.  Rattles a lot when driving and bad over bumps."
pontiac,montana,2002,Steve from Philly, 03/13/2002,Great family minivan,4,"The extended model is the way to go for larger families - plenty of cargo space. After 5 months and several ski trips we are still very pleased with this car. The GM Buypower purchasing experience was great - all the dickering by email, came in to sign the papers and the deal was EXACTLY as represented. No typical car dealer bull****. Try that with Honda's ""You can test drive it if you buy it first"" approach."
pontiac,montana,2002,Randy, 04/28/2008,Good van when it's not in the shop,2,"Bought used in jan 2005. Replaced rdm the first month. Steering rack alternator head gaskets a/c compressor evaporator coil wheel bearings x 3, 2 instances of broken wires to speed sensors replaced fluid in rdm replaced actuator for awd function. Good thing I was able to purchase the extra warranty.  2 bad I didn't get the 4 year plan."
pontiac,montana,2003,Montana, 05/31/2008,Not bad for a van,4,"Not a bad van. It's good on fuel, change oil every 5000 or so, and a tuneup 120,000 km runs great. I drive this 4 hour round trip. The inside is good to lots space for what I need it for and the kid's like for the dvd part."
pontiac,montana,2003,grisswalds, 10/12/2013,We love our Montana Mini Van,4,"We bought our Montana minivan new in 2003.
It is now 2013 and we're putting it up for sale.
It has 260,000 miles on it and has been the best reliable vehicle we've ever bought.
The only thing we had to replace was two hub assemblies and the alternator just went out last week.
260,000 miles on the same alternator.. Unheard of.. Just crazy.
We've been from New York to Texas to Florida and all parts in between.
It's been a great family car.
Thank you GM for making a reliable vehicle.
It's been a great ride:)"
pontiac,montana,2003,MAMU, 11/21/2010,Great Vehicle,4,"I bought my Montana with 7000 miles on it and now have 254,000. Consistently get 24-25 MPG. Put new heads on at 200K;seals at 100K but nothing else major.Been a great vehicle for the price. Hope to make it last another 2 years. 300K possible?"

running fine, without any issues. Just oil changes and brakepad changes. Very stable car and great pickup. Hwy

I have not had any trouble with my van.It handles and runs great.  I just wish it had a built in DVD center.  I have rear air and rear audio controls which has been a lifesaver for me and the kids on long trips.  The kids love the van.  I like it too just wish it had better gas mileage. From the sounds of some reviews  I am lucky.  Also it would be nice if there were more cupholders"
pontiac,montana,2003,mad@gm, 10/19/2004,Very Disappointed,2,"Purchased vehicle new in Dec 03 from 
Conkle pontiac.   Problems with 
interior features from day 1.  
Winshield leaked damaging the 
headliner.  In the first month of 
ownership the van was in the shop 20 
days.  The dealership has never fixed 
the problems and are now refusing to 
work on it.  My audio controls and all 
my interior lights are hanging down.  
Windows do not operate properly.  it 
has a continuing popping noise that is 
very loud and now my engine has 
developed a knock.  Would not 
recommend this vehice to anyone.  "
pontiac,montana,2003,Skip It, 07/21/2003,Only if you must,3,"I have owned 2 of these vehicles.  I 
had a 1997 model that was nothing but 
trouble and decided to give GM a second 
try by purchasing a second van from 
them.  Biggest mistake I have made in 
major purchases.  Not even 10000 miles 
in and the intake valve needed 
replaced.  The brakes are squeeling and 
the front end is making some weird 
rubbing noise that the dealer has had 
no luck locating. Oh, the glove box 
latch has been broken 3 times already.  
I won't be purchasing another GM 
vehicle for quite some time. Next van 
purchase will be a Honda or Toyota. "
pontiac,montana,2003,zigs, 05/31/2007,If You Think So,3,I think they tried to lure people in with the looks of the van more than the quality of it. This vehicle has never been wrecked. Yet a lot of the seams don't match or some are wider than others. Real poor quality control I would say. Sliding door hits the the driver door. You have to open the driver door so you can shut the sliding door. I haven't owned this vehicle very long so I can't say about the long term. If you buy one look at all the seams of the vehicle. With gas prices going up the fuel effeciency is fading fast on this one. It does ride smooth however. 
pontiac,montana,2003,MontanaBlues, 10/31/2002,Depressing,2,"Ours is a 2001, has 22000 miles on 
it. What has gone wrong?  Where do I 
begin.  The oil pan leaked and needed 
repair after 4500 miles; the power 
slider was recalled - ""repaired"" and 
then had to be repaired again at 6000 
miles;  the engine leaked antifreeze 
around 9000, needing new hoses; the 
transmission overheated while towing 
an ALUMINUM fishing boat (oh yeah, we 
have the ""towing"" package), and the 
thing squeaks and rattles so bad we 
sometimes think some of the structural 
welds have failed.  We will never 
return to a GM minivan. The Odyssey or 
new Quest look good for us."
pontiac,montana,2003,middrealtor, 02/03/2003,Most appealing minivan,5,"We find this minivan to be smartly 
styled compared to most minivans, very 
comfortable on the inside, and the 
engine is responsive.  If you compare 
prices for what you actually pay versus 
sticker price, this beats them all. 
Easy to reconfigure seating, double 
side doors, keyless entry, very nice 
features.  Service department much 
better than past GM dealerships."
pontiac,montana,2003,DRP, 10/13/2004,Great Family Van,4,"We have had the van two years now and 
put nearly 40,000 miles on it. It is 
comfortable for our family of five and 
is also economical to operate. Fuel 
economy is about 17/24, City/Highway. 
I have not had problems with any of 
the major systems. The following were 
fixed under warranty: Back up sensors 
in rear bumber, one heated seat 
element,cover for garage door opener 
in console(twice). Most of this was 
fixed while I was in for an oil change 
and was not terribly inconvienent. I 
have used a Thule storage box mounted 
to the roof racks on several occasions 
with no problems or discernable loss 
of mileage or handling. This car has 
met my expectations of GM quality and 
value"
pontiac,montana,2003,Montana, 07/14/2005,Love my Montana!,4,"I really enjoy driving our Montana.  I can take the grandma's with us with ease as the auto sliding doors and captain seats are great for them.  The grandkids really enjoy the DVD player!  The all around use of our Montana has been a good experience.  I only wish that the space between the drivers seats and the middle row captain seats was larger.  Also, on the driver and front passenger seats could use 2 arm rests instead of the door extension.   It is just not in the right place for long trip comfort.  We had those on our other van and really enjoyed them."
pontiac,montana,2003,Judith A. Johnston, 12/18/2005,Excellent,4,This is my first van.  I usually had trucks and am so impressed with this car that I would buy another one.

pontiac,montana,2003,bigmowaukee, 03/16/2011,Satisfying to own,3,"We've had a good ownership experience with our Montana. It's been quite reliable, with few major breakdowns in our eight years of ownership. While the vehicle isn't luxuriously equipped, it is comfortably appointed and feels luxurious in a Pontiacian sort of way. Haling the seats in and out is a pain...even worse than the Pontiac TransPort we had before it...but it has been one of the more satisfying cars I've owned. "
pontiac,montana,2003,Awfabee, 05/19/2009,AVOID!,2," Bought the AWD because we were moving out to the country. It was a company lease return, impeccably maintained. As soon as the warranty expired, we IMMEDIATELY suffered the infamous GMC intake manifold gasket debaucle. Since then, nothing but problems, mostly with the wheel hubs, bearings, and ABS/AWD sensors. Turns out a vehicle named ""MONTANA"" with AWD can't handle a bumpy gravel road. Worst vehicle we've ever owned... period.  "

years since I've purchased mine I've 
had to replace the entertainment 
system, the side door didnt close 
properly, and now the transmission is 
failing at 45,000 miles (all on a car 
which was bought new that has met all 
maintenance schedules).GM cares nothing 
about quality or reliability of their 
vehicles and their dealer service 
departments are incompetent at best and 
criminal at worst. My last vehicle 
before this was a new ""94 GMC Jimmy 
who's engine seized at 60k under

a few dollars more on a Honda and leave 
gm (garbage motors) alone"
pontiac,montana,2003,Ward Denise, 10/17/2015,Adapted as a Handicapped Minivan,5,"Our Montana was wheel chair adapted with an automatic side ramp. All modifications were to our satisfaction. My husband is in a power chair and easily has enough head space. The size of the van was a deciding factor in purchasing this van for our needs, and also a domestic product.  It is a 2003 with 78,000 miles and is still going strong. We just decided against buying a new van because ours is still low cost maintenance.

pontiac,montana,2003,Kelly, 07/26/2016,200K + Still Running,5,"The Lord has blessed me with this car! We bought it used with over 100K miles on it and have added plenty of our own! The car has been nothing but reliable since purchasing it in 2010. Even though the air conditioning has gone out, this car is trust worthy and has good pick up for a van its age and size. WE DO NOT BABY THIS VAN, it has stayed outside through years of harsh Chicago winters, in humid Pensacola, FL summers and now has been with me in Cincinnati through the winter and summer.

auto sliding side door mech. 2 times, 
front seat cushions 4 times (side 
airbag box built in the seat kept 
cutting them), front seat cover once

a '99, had some problems with the power 
sliding door but was otherwise well-
designed and very convenient.  Our 
new '03 keeps the convenience and 
builds on it with new features and very 
impressive fit & finish.  This van 
seems tighter and very responsive. (My 
16-year old son drove it and pronounced 
it ""Cool!"" -- not the usual teenage  
response to a minivan.) The remote 
lock/power door is a great feature if 
your hands are full of stuff to put 
into the car or if you're ferrying kids

fumble with a sliding door."

replace a head gasket.  GM 
automatically paid for this expensive 
repair.  I was hoping to pay it off and

were hooked right away! It drives like 
a dream. Smooth and the undercoat kills 
road noise. The kids love 
the ""Montanavision"" I call it A Mom's

on the market and having owned a 
Bonneville with 200,000 miles on it I 
knew the Pontiac would hold up!  The

The paint finish has chipped in a couple of places (without any rough treatment on our part!)we never had this problem with our previous van (Mitshbishi).

adressing the issues. The rear window 
washer does not spray enough volume. 
They don't know if the problem can 
corrected or if it is a design issue.

The van is safe, easy to drive, 
inexpensive to operate, excellent in

The headlight housing fills up with water during every rain storm.
This in turn has caused my Instrument Panel to kind of short out.
First the heat/water gauge, next the gas gauge, then the speedometer.
Which comes and goes at will.
It's arount 700-800 $ to fix, but with the water short problem, I don't see the point with the poor design.
Also everything plastic in this car has broken.
The cupholder door in the front of the van.
The window switches on both sides.
The motor is going on the drivers side window which is used more.

The DVD system is great.  Still trying to get the best gas mileage but it's tons better than our old 95 Blazer.  I do wish that it had more cubby holes and the climate station like my Blazer.

2003 currently.  Our previous Montana 
was a 1999 with the same problems as 
usualy reported (blown head gaskets, 
manifold gaskets).  This was due to 
Pontiac using the new long life 
coolent and paper gaskets which the 
long life coolent rapidly 
deteriorates.  All was replaced under 
warranty with no problems and the van 
drove great throughout.  They have 
apparently fixed this problem on the 
newer years which is great."

pontiac,montana,2004,clarkb, 01/25/2005,Liking Montana,4,"I am pretty happy with this van.  The DVD package is great.  It drives reasonably well.  It has good low-end torque, and moves away well from a stop light.  It could use more passing power.  Fuel Economy is a bit poor, but few minivans are much better.  The SV6 has addressed much of this.  After driving several vans, incl. the Odessy, Sienna, Freestar, and Town and Country, it is more responsive and refined than the other American entries.  Unfortunately, it is worlds behind the Sienna and Odessy.  With rebates, it was also $10K less, which more than compensates."

Not happy with this vehicle, and very disappointed as it is the first Pontiac I have had problems with.  What is with the Brakes.  How can they need replacing so soon?

We found what we were looking for with this van! It is the only one I found used in our town with AWD that seats 8.  The space is wonderful!

 Overheating was the initial problem and I've had coolant leaks fixed, a new water pump and thermostat put on.
The problem continued and I've ended up with a leaking head gasket, then the battery died and now it has electrical problems.
Door locks have never worked properly, the temp gauge sticks so I don't even know anymore if it is overheating.
I love it for comfort and roominess but I've lost all faith in it, and I only have 72k miles on it and drive it gently.
I'll be trading it in as soon as I can get to a dealer."

Issues in 5 years:
replaced tires 4 times in 8 years
the engine icon lights turns on occasionally, but after check up everything is alright. 
Sometimes the front a/c vent stops working for a couple of minutes and automatically starts again.

pontiac,montana,2005,Mark B, 05/22/2017,Lots of Problems,2,"The manual says when the ABS service light comes on, pull over, shut off the car, and start it again and the indicator light should go off. If the ABS system turning off randomly is a problem, they should have fixed it instead of leaving the issue in the car the sale and asking the driver to reset it 7 times a month. It seriously comes on ALL the time. Now the check engine light is on and the message says to check gas cap. I've replaced it with two different caps and had a certified mechanic try a few different ""fixes"" but the check engine light keeps coming back on with the same message. At 72k miles, it already won't pass emissions and the Blue Book value on it is not worth the price of repairs. The seats inside stain easily and are ugly, keyless entry already not working, and the DVD player is broken too.

It has performed well over the past year, though we had to replace a bad front wheel bearing, the rubber door gaskets came loose and the wind stretched the driver's door hinges (fixed at our local college). Recently replaced the crap General tires with Michelins and vastly improved the ride and noise; gas mileage is better too. The one thing we can't address are the rattles in the sliding doors.

Tires are worn after a year - seems you are to look inside the door and not read the tires for the correct pressure. The radio switches channels without catching all of the stations on it's own.

pontiac,montana,2005,dlink, 06/19/2008,2005 Montana SV6,2,"Purchased new at dealer in Fall 2004.  Bad electricals from the start (flickering head lights & dash lights) as well as annoying wind noise at 60 mph+. Dealer has no clue as to fixes.  Electrical wiring short occurred at 3.5 years and 106,000 miles involving main electrical circuit.  Dealer charges $2,500 to fix!!  This has not been a good vehicle given the fact that the van is worth about $6,000.  GM deserves what they get in the world of cars; they are losing market share for a reason.  Others make better cares and treat their customers slightly better! I will never buy from this dealer or GM again!"

I do though have a leakage of some kind on the drivers side on the inside, my floor mate is soaked and I cannot figure where the dampness is coming from, unless the A/C line to the rear is under the flooring? I have worn a hole in the flooring from the foot action while driving. I do drive alot and it has helped on gas expense.  Last I have some sort of electrical problem with the temp gauge. At times after drive for a bit and then shutting down, the gauge will max out. I have to turn the ignition switch back and forth rapidly."

I have the extended version and have found that it has good control on the road year round.  A few problems, which were limited in scope and  not serious.  Consisted of the following: slight rattle in dash - easily fixed, rear windshield wiper motor has given up - will need to be replaced, paint delamination next to rear center taillight - dealer will fix.  I have worked inside an Asian Automotive manufacturing plant and find the quality here relatively close but the value is in the price - probably a third cheap"

Anyone that does not agree with this does not realize the poor quality of this vehicle. On my third set of tires, cannot keep an alignment on it. Also just replaced brakes for the third time. I am not a reckless driver. Car dealers will not even accept these vehicles on trade in, will have to give it away. Buy a Toyota, I know I will be from now on. "
pontiac,montana,2005,Marky61, 03/20/2009,Lumpy quality,3,The good news is the Montana is a well designed minivan that eats up the miles comfortably and returns good gas mileage. The bad news is the van is built with cheap plastic inside that readily falls apart. The rear hatch pull strap broke in my wife's hand after only a few months. The transmission hesitates a little and I fear it will break down sooner than later. Wind caught the driver's door last week and yanked it hard against the hinges (fully open) and bent the top hinge.

Mystery to dealer and GM. They could care less this is a serious safety issue. We are stuck having to go in and have the doors fixed once every few months. GM customer service tells us it is fixed each time so what the heck do we want from them?? We are so unreasonable to want a car that works Fabric inside stains easily despite many coats from the dealer of Scotch-Guard. Cruise control accelerates by red-lining RPM's causing loss of control of the vehicle.  JD Powers gives this van its worst ratings across the board.  Hello Toyota - GM doesn't care if they lose a customer.

I wont even start to describe all the problems. From bumper to bumper , we have had problems. Poorest handling, poorest acceleration, when you hit a bump the doors feel like they are going to fall off. We are on our 3rd set of tires, we cannot keep an alignment on it. Unfortunately for us, we have tried to trade for another mini van of better quality, most car dealers will not accept them on trades and if they do , my kids bicycle is worth more than the van. "

I got 26 mpg with 4 adult passengers with luggage on a long trip, and 27.5 mpg on a solo trip when I set cruise control at 60 mph. "
pontiac,montana,2005,Francis Patt, 07/24/2005,A Great New Minivan,4,"The drive was very quiet, much quieter than Chrysler products and much less body roll than either the Honda or the Toyota vans.  Acceleration was reasonable, if not peppy, it again was better than other ""top reviewed"" vans.  The power doors aren't hard to close and the remote button is awesome.  Handlimg was all I would have expected and the braking was excellent.  Much better than the priginal Montana and better than the Chrysler product we traded in.  Apparently the four wheel disk brakes function much better than the drums in the rear of other vans.  This van is for my wife and she loves it.  I'd say GM hit a homerun with this vehicle."
pontiac,montana,2005,b burns, 08/15/2005,Pontiac Momtana SV6,4,"Very nice vehicle, DVD for the kids&plenty of room. Decent fuel economy W/ a great ride. Glove box is a little cheap, excluding that it was a great buy!"
pontiac,montana,2005,J.Briscoe, 08/15/2005,Best Pontiac I have had so far.....,4,"I rented the SV6 for our Grand Canyon vacation this year. With 2 12 yrs olds, a 17 yr old and 2 adults traveling together - we loved it. Plenty of room and everyone had excellent views while traveling. We were impressed enough to trade in my 2000 Boneville for a 2005 SV6. For me at 5'3"" the SV6 in much more confortable to drive than my Bonneville had been.I commute 65 miles roundtrip each week day and after driving the SV6 for two weeks - I am very pleased with it.After 2 Bonnevilles and a Grand Am this is my favorite Pontiac yet.It doesn't feel like a minivan at all - sure doesn't look like one either."
pontiac,montana,2005,Vicki, 08/28/2005,Nice Ride,4,"The SV6 is a very stylish fun to drive vehicle.  The kids love the dvd system, and all the captain chairs and soundsystem.  The low step in height is great.  Front visiblity is perfect while not so in the rear(head rests get in the way)  The power rear doors are great.  The seats are super comfortable much more so than others we test drove.( My husband & I test drove them all I bet).  We didn't mind them not being stow and gow as they were so much more comfortable.  The only complaint is maybe power when on the highway fully loaded with people & luggage felt a little sluggish but other than that perfect.  "
pontiac,montana,2005,Pierre S., 09/28/2005,Rolling Movie House,3,"The front driver/passenger have a fairly good ride  Transmission is smooth with plenty of motor power.  Misleading ads when it comes to available storage space, compared to the previous models. This model is drifting away from its true mission of what a mini van should stand for. It was poorly conceived to carry baggage with the seats folded. There is a need to increase the size door pockets to storage. This model has too much for for movie goers, with 4 oversized hardplastic headset holders poorly located for passager's own comfort, 2 pop-corn table with plenty of pop holders. The passager's second row of seat has a lot to be desired with restricted leg room. They did away with fog lights"
pontiac,montana,2005,Justin Case, 11/17/2005,Excellent Quality vehicle!,4,"Previous vehicle was a 96 Trans Sport with same 3.4 liter v-6. Got 260,000 miles out of that without any major mechanical problems, it paid for itself! This van is on the same path. Already, there is 32,100 on it and the only problem was a TSB for the throttle body. Didn't cause van to run poorly, it just made a whistling sound on light acceleration. Dealer fixed though under warranty, and that's it. Great comfort, very good acceleration, average fuel econ. (20 mpg. w/ mixed hwy./city driving), and great dependability. I would not be afraid to take this vehicle anywhere on a trip. I look forward to any years of ""Driving Excitement"" with this Pontiac!"
pontiac,montana,2005,seabeav, 12/08/2005,Where's the quality control,2,"Bought the new SV6 due to the expanding family.  Looked at others but none except ford/mercury included the expanded features for a reasonable price.  While I like the apperance and the creature comforts of the SV6, and the drive is typical of a minivan thats all there is to be happy or content with.  My vehicle has been in the shop 4 times over the first 3 months for various reasons including a faulty aligned door, replacement of a rear sliding door motor, replacement of a door handle, replacement of body molding, steering well casing replacement, windshield stripping replacement, and a dead battery.  Highway noise (wind) on this vehicle is terrible. Recommend pay extra $ for better quality"
pontiac,montana,2005,very mad, 01/05/2006,very mad,2,"This is a list of the things that went wrong with the vehicle since 2-05:  Alternator replaced (going to be recalled) 11-05  Left crankcase seal (dealer said its due to faulty build at plant) 11-05  All lettering fell off rear hatch (finally replaced 12-05)  Rear hatch handle faulty (never fixed by dealer properly)  Transmission slipping (dealer had found no evidence of this)  Tracking system engaged during dry Texas weather, locking up the wheels and making van undrivable unless you turned off the tracking system. Happened 1-1-06 when nobody could help us.  Stability tracking system service message on (dealer on 2nd try found a short in the computer which made wheels lock up."

pontiac,montana,2005,smith, 02/23/2006,my montana,4,"We just purchased our montana with 29,000 miles. it is still under warranty but we also bought the full warranty just in case so we do not have out of pocket expenses down the road. We had  a 12 screen dvd player installed for the kids as an after market feature. it is awesome. we love it so far. I did notice a whistling type sound coming from the windsheild when going over 50....anyone else had that?"
pontiac,montana,2005,NetNut, 04/06/2006,Do Not buy GM,1,I brought this van in Sep05. The ENGINE has been replaced 2 times. The Low Oil Presure Message and the ABS light are still coming on once a while. The gas gauge is fluctuating. The dealer still does not know how to fix it. DO NOT BUY GM.
pontiac,montana,2005,Florida Dad2, 08/07/2006,Florida Dad's Follow Up Review,3,"We've now had this van for a full year. Generally, we're still quite satisfied with the van, its comfort and quality. The leather has held up well, the DVD player is more popular than ever and the AC blows like a January blizzard.  However (oops, there's that word...) a few minor things have cropped up in the past year including a powered door that stopped working, brake trouble (not serious )a loose trim piece covering the sliding doors' track and a radio that switches stations w/o warning (only happens on one certain frequency ...huh?) All fixed quickly and cheerfully and under warranty, but should these have happened in the first place? "
pontiac,montana,2005,michael, 08/08/2006,love my sv6,5,"this vehicle has plenty to offer. It has surpassed my expectations. Roomy interior and practical environment. Stands out in the ""mini- van"" category."
pontiac,montana,2005,unhappy buyer, 08/19/2006,Save your Money,2,"I have had to alternators installed, both front stabilizer bars installed, power rear window bracket installed, does not have a lot of power to get onto the freeways. The air conditioning does not work all the time, it cuts in and out ( more out than in ) in traffic, better to open the windows. I have been a GM buyer for a long time but after this one I think I will change."
pontiac,montana,2005,snjmilly@aol.com, 07/03/2004,It's comfortable and affordable!!!,4,"This is my first mini van and I 
absolutely love it. We have taken it on 
several long distance road trips and 
the comfort and accessibility to the 
second and third rows is wonderful. I 
don't know who enjoys driving it more, 
me or my husband! It is very 
comfortable. "

children and everyone was comfortable 
and had their own space.  I love all of 
the features available on my Montana 
including the XM Satelite radio.  I 
think it is unique looking...it has a 
more sporty flair than all of the other 
vans on the market. "
pontiac,montana,2005,Matthew Pellegrini, 11/06/2004,My Montana,5,"I just bought a new Montana and would 
not buy anything else. The ease the 
handling and the style of the montana 
compare to no other min van 
classification. To top it off all the 
repair bills I had on the other one was 
oil changes no major repairs that is 
reliability. Thanks Pontiac for making 
such a great car!"
pontiac,montana,2005,Delaware Hobbs', 01/04/2005,Sporty!!!,4,"I knew as soon as I saw this coming 
attraction that I would have to hold 
off purchasing a new minivan until it 
arrived.  I bought a Montana in 98 and 
knew that I didn't want another minivan 
unless it was another Montana.  I was 
not disappointed by the look and style -
 It's the only truly sporty minivan as 
far as I'm concerned.  I didn't plan on 
buying leather this time but I felt the 
cloth interior just looked too cheap.  
It seems to handle fine but even though 
the engine is 3.5 instead of 3.4, I'm 
not convinced it performs better than 
my old one.
    There are little things I miss such 
as a light in the glove compartment, 
aux pwr outlet up front, dash space, 
reclining rear seats, see below"
pontiac,montana,2005,mommymobile, 01/15/2005,sv6 supporter,5,"The price is very affordable, the insurance is great also. It's great on gas. My children love it, my 3 year old gets in and out herself, the power slider door is wonderful when dropping off or picking up at school, no need to get out anymore. I love driving it.. it sure beats the suv I used to drive... so take it for a test drive... just make sure you get a sales persons that's right for you, and take the time and check out the dealership first.. ask around if anyone has dealt with that dealership. (I had a bad experience)"
pontiac,montana,2005,David, 01/15/2005,Montana Van Review,4,"The 2003 Pontiac Montana Van (long version) is a powerful V6 family vehicle. It has a very pleasing, sporty stylish exterior with all around rocker panel protection, aerodynamic body design, and heavy duty built under body.  It has one of the highest gas milage ratings of all the minivans, and lives up to the rating on and off the highway.  The interior design with captain chairs second row and split bench in rear is modestly roomy and functional design.  The rear seat fold down and easily removable seating is a plus in design capability. There are no mechanical, electical or interior vices after 3 years of usage. The only negative aspect is the uncomfortablness of the front captain seats."
pontiac,montana,2005,Geo, 01/16/2005,George review,3,"Cold --- even in a mild climate, you freeze if the temp gets below 10. Windows frost over at any temp below 40, defrost doesn't help. Why RED dash display?? We've known since 1970 when watches with red led displays came out... YOU CAN'T SEE RED LED DISPLAYS IN SUNLIGHT!.... RED DISPLAY IS USELESS IN SUN LIGHT. Seats do not fold out of the way. Front windshield needs to be made thicker, first hit with a peace of flying gravel, good buy window. Headgasket leaks, wheel bearing out at 80000 miles. I would expect this from a CHRYSLER product. And not last or least.... what it the engine thermostat doing imbeeded so far down in the engine it takes 3 hours repair time and a $250.00 bill to replace it? "
pontiac,montana,2005,Trisa, 01/23/2005,I would buy it again,4,I use it like a work horse and it performs amicably.  I works well for the family and all the stress children can place on a vehicle.  The Montana Vision has made long trips tolerable with the kids.
pontiac,montana,2005,montanauser, 02/19/2005,My Montana,3,Other than the fact that was a fleet vehicle or so we were told by the maintenance department (not the sales) It seems overall to be an ok vehicle. We are having some electrical issues. brake lights etc;. also one problem with the windsheild whistling and service blew smoke at us till warranty won't assist. also the drivers seat has always had a slight lean that makes it uncomfortable on longer trips
pontiac,montana,2005,jane sawyers, 02/19/2005,lov the sv6,5,Room and utility. Have driven vans for many years - this is by far the best van on the market today. Keep up the great work pontiac.
pontiac,montana,2005,Notcho, 02/24/2005,Excellent Status,5,"Wanted a vehicle that would allow some movement in the vehicle while traveling.  This one has auto outlets as well as a 110 outlet that can be used for a small plug in fridge. When I need to use the 4 cup coffee pot or microwave I just unplug the fridge for a few minutes and use the micro to pop some popcorn or what ever.. It also has a built in pump for pumping up what ever is needed. Last week I had a flat from a slug I picked up. Instead of having to change the flat tire I just got out the hose for the pump , blew up the tire and drove to the station for repair. Excellent handling and roadability."
pontiac,montana,2005,Becky, 03/16/2005,The happy family,4,"We traded in our Aztec for a nicely equipped Montana SV6 with 1SB package. The standard OnStar is not only a nice feature, but helped to lower my auto insurance because it is considered an anti-theft device.  The optional rear parking assist, optional power sliding doors, and standard DVD player help to keep us all happy and our 18 month old content).  While some might find the 200 horses lacking, I find it to be plenty after driving the 185 hp Aztec for 3 years.  I miss the heads up display and fog lights from the Aztec, but otherwise am very happy with the purchase.  The body styling is MUCH more appealing than the OLD Montana too."
pontiac,montana,2005,Minivan Dad, 08/02/2005,"Early use, but promising!",4,"Having owned a '96 Voyager previously, we were VERY pleased with our Montana. The quality and materials are first rate and the build appears to be solid. We had to get the chrome wheels for $650 (pricey!)and weren't allowed to exchange them for cheaper alloys due to the employee discount rules. The ride is butter smooth and the power adequate. With the employee discount, we feel that we received an excellent value for the money. A reccommended vehicle!"
pontiac,montana,2005,Gandolf, 08/09/2005,It's A great Van!,4,I shopped around for a few months looking for a van and this was the best layout and design for our family that i found.  The options were exactly what we needed and the fit and finish were excellent.  The van is quiet and a lot of fun to drive.  The braking is noticably better than other vans.
pontiac,montana,2005,Gary, 08/10/2005,2nd Montana,4,"When I saw the employee pricing, I decided to trade my 03 Montana for a 05, but I could not find one that I wanted.  Looked at the SV6, thought about it and got a loaded one.  4 weeks later it was on the road for a 4 week vacation in NE.  3 bikes on top, rear seats down, loaded to the gills.  What a joy.  DVD and the ability to multitask the sound system was great.  Satellite radio!  Where was it when I was driving cross county in 1980.  Seems to be a little less elbow room in the front, but the change in the interior of the doors makes up for it. Plenty of storage space, like the removable storage compartment.  Good for putting things away when parking in the city. "
pontiac,montana,2005,rsv6, 10/13/2005,GM Again,4,"I traded in my '99 Suburban, against my wife's wishes(!) because it was costing too much to operate. The SV6 was the perfect replacment. We took the 1SA package, because I could not pass up the deal. The dealer had loaded units available, but I really didn't all the extra items. I only wish that every option didn't come in a package. It would be nice to have rear window defroster without having to spend $2200 for everything else that come with it!"
pontiac,montana,2005,nothappy, 10/14/2005,not happy,2,"Loved the van when we first bought it, but several things have happened since then. The transmission has slipped either going from park to drive or taking off from a stoplight/stopsign. Almost all of the decals have fallen off on the rear hatch. The battery also quit on us. Now I feel we are stuck until we get caught up payment wise to merit selling or trading in on another vehicle."
pontiac,montana,2005,Zach, 10/13/2005,Un-reliable and Un-Safe!,2,"We loved the traction control, and the load leveling system at first. In Dec., everything went wrong! load leveling system stopped working in  awkward stance and it was more up in the back then the front. dealer charged us $863.00 for that to be fixed. Then the headgasket went and the emergency brake failed when parked. After we got all of that fixed, an accident ouccured in January. We were on the NYS Thruway and we were going on a trip. Then we were hit in the back of the minivan by a SUV and then we slammed into the pick-up truck in front of the van and intruded into my wife and I and we were sent to the hospital, and my wife was in a coma for 4 months. Will never buy a GM again!"
pontiac,montana,2005,Michael, 12/03/2005,Stylish but different,5,great vehicle and really fun to drive.....had choice of the 4 gm vans....and pick the sv6.....the bold looking front end was the final selling point....plenty of room inside and comfortable ride.....bottom line.......one very happy customer.
pontiac,montana,2005,Mrstitch, 01/25/2006,Rear passenger room,3,Poorly designed for passengers entering or exiting the rear seats. When a front seat passenger adjusts his seat backwards often the rear seat passenger gets a seat jammed into his knees.
pontiac,montana,2005,Shell0995, 02/19/2006,Love the SV6!,4,"I had did comparisons between the Uplander and SV6.  Found the SV6 to be a better deal.  We purchased a 2005 in 2/06, so it was one of the last of the previous year to be sold off the lot.  Had pretty much all options on it, which is great.  The standard DVD system is great for our 2 yr old."
pontiac,montana,2005,P. Montana, 03/22/2006,It's been great...,5,"Our first close to new vehicle... it is perfect for all of our needs.  I would like to have had it in an all wheel drive.  It is very comfortable to drive.  Our first preference would have been the Toyota Sienna, but this fit our budget better.  Highly recommended."
pontiac,montana,2005,pontiac montana, 04/04/2006,Pontiac Montana has a few discomforts,4,"Our experience was good until at 11,000 miles an awful harmonic sound began occuring at highway speeds of 65-75 mph. Dealer could not locate it and we all directed it to the replacement of the passenger side headlamp but to no avail. After 3 visits to dealer,and 3000 miles, it was discovered that noise ""probably""  taking place in driver's side door as we placed a handkerchief on the weatherstrip by the mirror and it ceased completely for 1500 miles. But the sound is attempting to return but not as painful as before. Plastic door trim on each side appears loose and causes concerns of faulty installation.We miss the lights that stay on on  our dodge caravan as well as the door locked sound"

Tons of room, with a comfortable-for-adults, fold-flat third row. Fits 5 adult passengers with 2nd row bench seating and 6+ full-sized luggage pieces with third row folded. Much storage. Engine was powerful to begin with, but definitely had lost noticeable ""punch"" after one year.  CD stereo radio sound was adequate but not great. Questionable build quality created worrisome driving @ 42K miles with a loud, metallic ""clanking"" sound when riding over bumps (dealer attempted to fix, but sound resurfaced within 5K); ""ghost"" power door that closed on command but opened by itself when parked; ""chirping"" noises when I turned right."

Still rides and runs great. Front wheel drive handles great in snow-plows right through it. In extremely cold Midwest winters has never failed to start; not even once. This last few years I have had to put some money into it here and there, but after 14 years and 138,000 miles, some things do tend to wear out. I am starting to think about a new vehicle, even though I will hate to say goodbye to this one...I am starting to notice a bit of hard shifting and am not looking to put a new transmission in an almost 15 year old vehicle. However, I can say that, to date, this has been the best and most reliable vehicle I have ever owned. I wish they still made them because I would not hesitate to buy another.

Our van has vever let us down and other then routine maintence oil changed at 4,000 miles (oil is cheap people change it often) brakes replaced rotors were fine

Only problem sensor for all wheel drive has gone out twice, first time the switch 2nd time the housing had to be replaced as well. warranty covered both times. This is a comfortable ride on the highway, goes great in snow. It will average from 18.5 to 19+ at 70 mph and I have gotten as as high as 22 mpg at 60 mph.

There are 7 in our family...5 kids. We LOVE this van. Everyone thinks it is an SUV. It looks classy and drives better than anything I have ever driven or owned before. It is luxurious and smooth.  The children all have plenty of room. The seats are very comfortable in the front, middle, and back.  It is quiet, smooth, and handles like a dream. If you have ever driven a Saturn of any kind, this drives just like that. I love it.  If you feel the price (@$30K) is too much, find a used one, even a few months old..lose the 20% depreciation. "

In the first week of having it I noticed transmission fluid dripping from under the engine.  It turns out they needed to replace seals in the transaxle.  This is major surgery on essentially a brand new vehicle.  I traded a 2004 Kia with 30,000 miles on it that had never had a single issue, so I was very disappointed to have these kinds of problems immediately.  The GM certification sure didn't mean much.  I wonder now what else will be waiting for me from this point forward."

I have always done the regular maintanance on the vehicle at the dealership and still this thing has been nothing but problems. They have had a steering column recall,comes with crappy tires (good for about 25000 km at most,has had to have numerous brake jobs, a transmission flush at 78000 km,bushing arms replaced, rotors replaced etc. \"
pontiac,montana-sv6,2006,MLL, 12/17/2006,Cross Country Driver,4,"Rented vehicle for cross country trip from Seattle to New Jersey and back with a side trip to Northern California....9000 miles in all over a month's time...vehicle ran great adequate room for three fully loaded with cargo and then some...vehicle was fully loaded,comfortable ride considering the amount of driving,wife enjoyed driving and sitting up high..like the look (SUV)but more than enough room (minus the seats)....Would highly consider buying if in the market."
pontiac,montana-sv6,2006,Brandon & Carol, 12/25/2006,Great Looking Plus Safety For Less $$$,4,"Good looking van with tons of features but $5-7K CAN less than Toyota or Honda. Ext. body more solid and safe than both imports.  Had van since Jun/06 and it drives good on wet or slippery conditions with traction control.  Fantastic for hauling large items with fold down rear seats.  Local dealer was willing to give $4000 off listed price, which Toyota or Honda refused to give.  Plus, interest rates for leasing or financing was lower than both imports, therefore, saved close to $2-3000.  Was concern with reliability of GM vans over Toyota or Honda vans, but with regular scheduled maint., I can see this van lasting 5-7 years without any major problems. Dodge Vans have bad trans history."
pontiac,montana-sv6,2006,EJN, 07/06/2010,2006 Montana,4,"Bought the vehicle out of state. The vehicle has been over all reliable in that no one has been stranded. Had trouble with the electric side door, the interior light control switch, rear wiper motor, not starting the first time with the ignition switch (software). Both sliding doors jammed on the bottom weather striping. Dissatisfied with the dealer and staff that services vehicles. They had to put the computer on the car (told them not to) and charge me to say the wiper motor is dead. My non mechanical wife told me that. Mad at my local dealer with the poor service and their technicians not following instructions. Have over 80,000 miles on the tires. Economy dropped with the alcohol gas."
pontiac,montana-sv6,2006,smitty, 06/07/2008,Lemon this van is a nightmare,1,"Bught brand new, always had a Pontiac so I thought this van would be good. boy was I wrong. It's been in the shop every month for something. It leaks water, threw the wheel well and the carpet gets soaked. It had to be stripped out inside and totally resealed. where they asleep on the job the day they made these vans?   This was turned into the lemon law through GM but no response. Will never buy another Pontiac again. "
pontiac,montana-sv6,2006,Not Happy, 06/22/2008,Never Again,2,"Bought this van with excitement and now can't wait to dump it.  Fuel economy is horrible (Average 17 highway) and keep getting message that the All-wheel drive is disabled.  Had it in the shop five times and they say nothing is the matter with it.  Had to buy new tires for it because the ball joint in the passenger front went bad and tore up the tires.  A joint in the steering column had to be replaced and when you apply the brakes, the whole van shutters.  To top it all off, the interior stains horribly with just water. Not impressed."
pontiac,montana-sv6,2006,Goodbye Pontiac, 07/17/2008,Don't Buy One!,3,"I have been buying Pontiacs for many many years, I am so disappointed with this product, I will probably not buy another.   I will be saying hello to Ford again.  The seats water stain and I am talking one trip to the pool and your seats will be a mess and take many many hours of work.   I even had the dealership steam them and that didn't work.  I scrubbed and scrubbed and had to saturate the whole seats to get them decent.   Next time to pool, they did it all over again.   They knew this and continue to use this material.  If it doesn't have leather seats, don't even think about it, you will be as sorry as I am.  Can't wait till it is time to trade.  Emailed a complaint and no results."
pontiac,montana-sv6,2006,Mom, Dad & 2 teens,Montana SV6 3.9 L GREAT VAN!,4,"The 3.9 L engine is real peppy. I had a 2000 Montana with a 3.4 L engine that had the Dexcool leak problem.  Still it lasted me 138,000 miles before being totaled in an accident.  Had to have my Montana Van back, so I chose the SV6. Teens love the DVD & wireless headphones.  I love the remote start.  This Van offers a lot of features for a good price."
pontiac,montana-sv6,2006,Judy, 12/14/2008,Junk heap only,2,"I purchased a 2006 Pontiac S6 as a repo from a bank in June 2008. It had 43,000 miles on it. Within a week of purchasing, it had ""service stability soon"". Front hub was bad - $525.  I was also told there were 13,000 these parts on back-order. No recall tho. Back brake pads had to be replaced & rotors turned. Front needs it too. Seats stain from water. Tonight I drove to my sisters and I swear I'm riding a broncing buck. Have no idea what's wrong. I'm sure it's big bucks whatever it is. This is why I drove Toyotas for 20 years and will probably never drive another American product and the big 3 wonder why they're in trouble. "
pontiac,montana-sv6,2006,Matt Miller, 09/13/2009,""" Wooden Wheels ""....Junk",1,"Rear suspension is the the most clunkiest, hard hitting that I've ever experienced. Its been diagnosed as ""thats how they are"". Whoever passed this through the quality inspection at the factory must have worked for the Amish previously. It sometimes has trouble starting and the inside looks bad from staining. I still owe too much to trade in though. I never noticed the suspension clunking during the test drive because I drive down a smooth newly paved road. Also, the traction control starts working on dry pavement while not actually spinning, so I sit still for no reason for a few seconds."

I have brought this back to the dealer so many times it is ridiculous! I bought a new car/van so I wouldnt have mechanic bills - and, the bills keep mounting.  There is no excuse for the lousy fabric they use for interiors; they know its an issue and no one cares. ALL DONE BUYING GM PRODUCTS. NEVER AGAIN!!"
pontiac,montana-sv6,2006,ZDW, 05/05/2010,"Great looking car, crappy build",3,"I purchased this vehicle because I liked the outer body design, however I have had nothing but problems with this vehicle.  I have had to replace the sway bar link twice, replace the brakes and rotors numerous times, the wheel bearings are shot, the bushing had to be fixed, the shocks are shot, and it is difficult to start.  Additionally, the automatic door sometimes refuses to close and there is this annoying ding sound the entire time we are driving. This car was purchased for me to drive my family around and now it looks as though I am going to have to trade it in for a better car."
pontiac,montana-sv6,2006,Pope, 08/07/2006,Rental,4,"Rented the Montana SV6, for seven days, I received so many compliments, It is comfortable,roomy, and it looks like an SUV, but inside its set up like a minivan. I love it, trying to talk my husband into buying one buy very pricey.  "
pontiac,montana-sv6,2006,Maryland, 01/18/2007,Why Another Pontiac,4,"I wanted to add to a previous post that one of the reasons I chose a Pontiac is because I am still driving a 1992 Pontiac Transport.  I turned 299,000 miles today and it is still running like new.  The car has the original engine and has had no major engine work.  I had the original transmission rebuilt at 284,000 miles.  The overall maintenance costs have been extremely low.  Who knows, I might get another 300,000 miles. "
pontiac,montana-sv6,2006,Mike, 05/07/2008,Do not buy this vehicle,1,"This is the worst vehicle I have ever own and I have been driving for 28 years.  The front end has been repaired twice, the interior stains with WATER, yes water.  There is no leg room between the driver and middle row of seats.  The middle row is so close that the seats cannot fold forward as the head rest hits the front seats.  Sometimes it doesn't turn over for no reason. The only good thing is that I'm trading it this week for a Ford Fusion.  I hate this car so much that I'm even taking a payout loss of $7000.00. DO NOT BUY THIS VAN."
pontiac,montana-sv6,2006,Cavea T. Emptor, 06/07/2006,"Cheap, but cheap",2,"I'm amazed by the generous reviews, but I guess buyers want to be happy. Shoppers should be more critical however, so beware. It has the usual hundred little fit and finish flaws that typify domestics, which should not come as a surprise. However, the ceiling is lower than previous models, and although I'm only 6', I have to slouch to avoid hitting my head on the center console and outer pillar. Leg room for driver and front passenger is barely adequate. Same old silly under- the-hood wipers are impossible to clear without lifting the hood. At least they moved the grille off the hood assembly so you might not shatter it in cold weather. It runs, but you get what you pay for."

pontiac,montana-sv6,2006,stepht, 07/28/2008,Front End Problems and Bad DVD Player,4,"I bought the van in March 2007 as new. It ran great but after 3 months the DVD player started to skip all the time. It was replaced and seems to work fine now. The front end had problems. My ABS,Stability, and Traction control lights all came on at once last month. They replaced the passenger side hub and something in the steering column. When I got it back it now pulsates badly when braking from a higher speed and the steering moans loudly when I turn left. It is back in the shop now. I hope this resolves the issues. I like the dealership where I purchased the car and the dealership in town that does the service."

The back blinker has went out several times and the front driver setbelt is broken and is going to cost over 200 to fix!! The seats are all ridiculously stained!I have had my van professionally cleaned several times and the stains will not come out! Even water!"

My wife drives about 60 km return trip to work 5 days a week she loves it.  Some may say it has problems. Only work done on ours is had calipers sanded and rear rotors. Tires good for another 30,000 km likely. Going from our 1999 Ford Contour in 2 years owning it spent over $ 5,000 in repairs montana a dream no bi weekly repairs. Only complaint my uncle had was the deep space front wipers go into freezing rain snow there bothered him he called it a pig trough becauses was so deep could be improved. Seats do stain easily but is newset automobile we have ever owned is great"

Long rides are easy to drive. Very practical.  Cons: Build quality is questionable. SW problem (fuel cap is open message) took 3 weeks to diagnose and repair). Now have a horrible creaking noise when turning wheel and front end is very noisy when going over bumps.. suspect stabilizer bars.  Engine. Very powerful in cruising, reasonably fuel efficient.

GM is not standing by their product and refusing to reimburse us for the cost of repairs. I see this as a sign of things to come, so, we're dumping this car as soon as we can and buying HONDA.

We had trouble with the power door (broken cable), broken DVD player, rear wiper motor, front steering shaft, front suspension components, premature brake wear, even the keyless entry fob and remote start had issues. Battery cables and battery also needed to be replaced for the vehicle to start. Bottom line, you get what you pay for. This van cost me more to drive even with extended warranty than my other car."

In the month or so that we've owned the car, we've loved the design- both interior and exterior, enjoy the DVD (I was originally lukewarm about this feature) and my wife loves the powered doors.  Performance is adequate, but no more than that. Fuel economy is fine for this type of vehicle.  The jury is still out on the usefulness of the storage box behind the rear seat. Sometimes we use it, sometimes not (usually not). At least it's removeable.  Overall, we've truly enjoyed our purchase and with 2 kids (and a 3rd due in April) we need this vehicle's versatility more than ever!"
pontiac,montana-sv6,2006,David Battistel, 10/29/2005,Montana SV6,4,"We really didn't want to purchase a minivan, but it was really our only option based on our space requirements. I will only buy GM products, so the SV6 was a natural choice. I was not too keen on it at first (I would have rather had an SUV), but it has grown on me since. I really enjoy driving it (not as much as my Sierra though) and I am impressed with the overall package. If it turns out to be as great as my truck, I will be very happy."

This van cost me CAD$28000; if I am getting the same feature in an Odessey will cost me CAD$37500; Sienna will cost me CAD$36800; Quest will cost me CAD$37000.  I am getting the best value of my dollar for the most features and quality.  It does not run on EXPENSIVE premium gas as the Quest. The frequently replaced ""no flat"" tire as the Sienna. Mind you ""no flat"" tire cost 25% more each and it has life 30% shorter than standard tire.  "
pontiac,montana-sv6,2006,Best in its Class, 02/22/2006,Satisfaction Guarantee,5,"Excellent mileage and lots of leg room. Drive it daily to work on the Hwy, very responsive engine. Actual mileage is about 8.2L/100km Hwy & city combine. City alone is about 13.4L/100km.  This is very good for a van.  The van is huge, lots of compartment and storage space, however, it drives like a car."

Comfortable on the highway, but wish we had the bigger engine, it sometimes struggles up hills with a full load. On the 4 lane highways cruises along nicely. The kids love the DVD player, and we love the headphones for them so we can listen to what we want. The back-up alarm is awesome for city parking. A well recommended vehicle. Dual sliding doors are essential with 2 kids. Kids love being high up so that they can see out. Cargo tray in back is somewhat cumbersome.

Montana has a nice ride to it.  Love the extra cargo space and still have enough room for stroller in the cargo area.  Hubby drives Chevy Trailblazer and doesn't mind driving the mini-van when we go places because the look is close to suv!!  The interior is sharp!!  Can't say enough about this van!!"
pontiac,montana-sv6,2006,Wing, 06/17/2006,Reasonable Deal,4,"I have a regular wheel base. The interior is furnished with good quality material. The seats are comfortable.  Handling is very car like with adequate power. I have never loaded up the van with 7 adults and cargo. I cannot tell whether the van has enough power when it's fully loaded.  There needs to have some improvement on the seat arrangement. In my opinion, there is too much leg room for the third row seat while the second row has barely enough legroom. If GM can rearrange the seats a little bit, it will make the van more passenger friendly.  Fuel consumption for city drive is 14.6L/100km. Highway driving is about 10L/100km. my combined fuel consumption is 11.6L/100km.  "

Have had it for 17 months. So far has had new alternator, ignition switch, front hub, new radio, sliding door locks, many new wires, rear door handle broke on first cold day, cup holder replaced, OnStar antennae fixed, many electrical adjustments, too numerous to remember. Still only 50,000 kms and troubles still happening- a real lemon. Had difficulty finding 17 inch winter tires when purchased."

pontiac,montana-sv6,2006,Martin, 07/18/2007,2006 Montana,4,Had this van only a short time but it used with only 11K on it.  Had driven a '96 Dodge Grand Caravan for the past 6 years and the Montana is a nice ride! Feels beefier and is feels roomier inside. We opted away from stow-and-go seating of the other newer vans because although they do fold away nicely- they aren't really comfortable for long trips. The Montana back seats are sturdy and comfortable and we love the cargo area very functional with the tray  installed and the built-in air pump is handy. So far this gets my recommendation!
pontiac,montana-sv6,2006,George J, 08/18/2007,Pontiac Montana SV6,2,"The interior design is very poor.  The second row seats won't fold down because the head rests are so big they hit the front seats.  Also, they don't flip up like my Chevvy Venture's seats did to make more room temporarily for cargo.  They also have slippery rounded backs, so you can't carry anything on them when they are in the down position.  They are too heavy for me to carry alone, whereas I could carry 2 of the Ventures seats at the same time.  The third row seats are even heavier, requiring two people to move them.  Further on the headrests, they are so large as to render rear vision very limited.  You have to use the mirrors to back up.  The dealership has been great though.  "
pontiac,montana-sv6,2006,clatimri, 08/21/2007,Disappointed,2,"I really thought this would be a great family vehicle. I bought it used with only 9000 miles on it.The front end needed many things replaced. The ride....very rough in the driver seat.  Rode in the back with children, it was the most uncomfortable seat I ever sat in.  The bucket seats..cheap..material leaves terrible ring stains from even water....those seats were uncomfortable too.  The rode noise was horrible.  We always had to turn radio up or dvd player up louder to hear it. I have always been a dedicated gm buyer..........no more pontiac vehicles for me.  "

I bought only 4 months ago, have had it in the service dept 8 times with sliding door problems, overhead console breakage, bounce in front end, starter is messing up, and got a message ""service due soon"". I have 1800 miles on vehicle.  I got ripped off royally, being a woman they took advantage and dumped a bad car on me.  I was talked into buying it before I knew it was a 2006, 2 year old van being sold as new. I was given a phony story by the salesman. I think they saw me coming with ""Sucker"" written on my forehead! I am thoroughly disappointed in it and the dealership attitude about it. Service dept helpful & nice, but I wish I had my Dodge van back!"
pontiac,montana-sv6,2006,Rick D., 04/19/2008,Water leaks,3,"I purchased a 2006 SV6 AWD. It was a used lease van with 12,500 miles.The dealer prepped it for sale after purchase agreement. I have been a GM owner and mechanic for 30 years.I wanted the AWD version for safety in winter. It handles,brakes and has more comfort than the Astro AWD it replaced.The 3.5liter engine power per weight ratio is too low, but the 3.9 liter has too much torque for the AWD unit! The van had a major flaw that may have been unique to this one or a problem on the assembly line.It had a chronic water leak from the wheelwells and all the seams.The rug was always wet. The dealer had to completely strip out the interior and found multiple leaks from improper sealant at all seams"
pontiac,montana-sv6,2006,Syler B, 12/05/2019,Best first vehicle!,5,"Bought my 05 Montana SV6 in late February, was put on the road in August. has been extremely reliable, i love the notifications it gives me when it needs servicing. It is the short wheel base model. FWD. I myself had put over 20,000 kms on it since its been on the road and have had minor issues.

pontiac,montana-sv6,2006,a.robins, 07/18/2020,mud tank,4,it's not the smoothest ride but we live in Florida in the country our 2006 montana now has 200k and is still running like a tank thru mud roads it's roomie has all kinds of secret storage compartments plus power everything the only major repairs I've had to do to it is change the linkage cable the rear shocks and ignition switch granted I take care of my cars and she gets an oil change every 1500 miles I don't really go far there is rusting on the frame but all in all it has out lived 2 trucks 1 ford 1 Chevy and a BMW I think if well taken care of a Montana well give you and your family many enjoyable miles for many years to come 
pontiac,solstice,2006,David256, 01/13/2014,"13 years and 160,000 miles",4,"I bought my '06 Solstice in 2008, when it had about 15K miles. Upon delivery the top fastening hook was damaged, and the rear end was bad (differential too noisy to be OK). The water pump had a small leak, too.

A dealership replaced the rear end as a warrantied item, and I fixed the top. Nearly 85K miles later, the water pump seal was finally passing enough coolant to warrant replacing the pump. Eventually the car started hard-shifting, especially when down-shifting. After replacing the two actuator sensors at the overhead cams, the shifting issue (mostly) went away. I've since figured out dirty oil, thin oil, or low oil contribute to the sensors' compel the car's TCM to go into protection mode, so when it does malfunction I know what to inspect/do.

At 160,000 the car is very reliable, and still gets compliments. All of my children have taken turns using it as their daily driver, and they've loved every minute driving the car.

pontiac,solstice,2006,Mike W., 11/03/2016,"Fun, looks great, and very quirky",4,"The Solstice is the latest two-seater convertible I've owned; previous cars include the Honda del Sol (my all-time favorite car), the Toyota MR2 Spyder, the Audi TT, Mercedes SLK 230, Mazda MX-5 Miata, and the BMW Z3. Here's what I see as the good and bad after owning my vehicle for about a month: First, it looks great. I have gotten several compliments on it already. I love the lines and the way the convertible top completely disappears into the trunk. The car is a blast to drive, and it hugs the road. There's no windscreen, but the heat blasts strong, keeping me toasty on a chilly day. The gas mileage overall has been just OK, but I did get about 33 MPG on a recent road trip. Now, for the not-so-good...this is the quirkiest car I've ever had. I didn't notice until after I had bought the car that there are no power windows or locks. I thought that just about every car had power windows and locks; you have to roll the windows up and down with the old-fashioned hand crank. The cup holders are behind the driver in the center, making them pretty useless, especially when one has to use his right hand to shift the gears. The hood release takes a scavenger hunt to find. It's kind of a pain in the butt to put the top up or down, but I don't mind that too badly; I'm spoiled because I had been driving convertibles with power tops; and with the Spyder and Miata it was simple to put the top up or down from inside the car. The build quality doesn't seem good; the leather on the seats seems like it will rip eventually, and there's plastic, plastic, plastic everywhere. With all that, I still love the car. I didn't buy it because I mistakenly thought it was a Z4; I bought it because it had low mileage, looked great, and the overall reviews from owners are very good. The bottom line is that if you can tolerate the quirks, this car is just plain FUN. I plan to keep this beauty for a long time; I bought a beater for run in the winter time.

pontiac,solstice,2006,Klaus VB, 07/02/2016,My American English Roadster,5,"I have long wished for an affordable English Roadster - 2 seats, impractical, zoomy, fun car. Most of those have left the realm of affordability. So after test driving 5 times, I took a chance on this car. No regrets at all. I love how it drives, I love how zoomy it is. There are so few out there that you don't see many on the road and people think it is WAY more expensive a sports car than it actually is. Heads turn wherever I go and people approach me at the gas station to talk about it. Since it is my 'fun car', I do not worry much about the storage capacity (there is almost none). If you are looking for something to cruise in, run about on a beautiful day or drive to work (and then daydream about leaving for the day) than this is your car.  ON THE OTHER HAND - I wish GM had put a little nicer fit and finish in the interior. The hard plastics are a bummer and the leather isn't great. The top is a little wonky to get up and down, but when stowed the car looks fantastic. I have had the car for over a year now and have only had to change the oil.
"
pontiac,solstice,2006,Rich, 04/28/2016,It is a number 60 in the first year of production,5,"Love the style, very reliable handles great. Stero wonderful  the looks of this car is priceless, and I feel like a millionaire driving the car in the Hamptons. People stop to say that I have a beautiful car. I really love it. Never a problem right now I have 8800 miles. Very low. But I intend to use it much more this summer.
"
pontiac,solstice,2006,Jeff, 11/15/2006,I love my Solstice!,5,"A lot has been said about this car's downfalls. All I know is, when I drive this car, I get excited. I haven't met anyone who hasn't fallen in love with it's looks. Why else would you buy a 2 seat convertible? This car is more fun than when I used to ride a motorcycle.  Compare the Solstice to its competitors. For looks, you'll need to compare it to a car nearly three times the price.  I love my Solstice!"
pontiac,solstice,2006,GRNNSXE n Cali, 12/13/2007,Vroom Vroom,5,"I got my Solstice in January 06, just after my daughter turned 21 years old.  Now, it's just me and the Chihuahuas.  Such a fun, fun car to drive.  Heads turn all over the place, especially with the top down.  Love the sound that she makes.  A neighbor once asked if I had made modifications.  Nope I told him, she just purrs like that. Vroom, vroom."
pontiac,solstice,2006,vett4dr, 10/10/2006,wotariot,4,"This is the perfect vehicle to be used for exactly the target of its designers & engineers.  A weekend fun car.  Not a long distance tourer (trust me, I drove round trip from the Detroit area to Orlando - NOT recommended), not a daily commuter in the Rust Belt.)  But for a top down weekend get-away, it's GREAT."
pontiac,solstice,2006,Mafasa, 08/05/2008,Two years and love my Solstice,4,"Great car to drive. Most reviews I've read are on manual transmissions. I ordered an Automatic, hey! I'm getting on in years and manuals are just to difficult for these tired broken limbs. Anyway, I had to wait almost six months for it to come into the dealers. Well worth the wait. I love the sports car feel, it's like you can feel the weather lines that run horizontally across the pavement or the lines where the concrete pieces in the road come together."
pontiac,solstice,2006,Mike Torres, 03/29/2007,Great Style Well Built,4,"I love sports cars. When this vehicle was on the drawing boards I kept articles on it. When delivered it fully met my expectations. I purchased mine with a convertible acoustic roof (thick). It drives very quite, has a great stereo system, and handles very well. On turns it hugs the road. I have not had any mechnical issues at all with my car. If you need to make an emergency stop, this car stops very quick with no loss of control. This car handles very well and looks like a corvette from the rear, yet has a european sports look from the front. Depending on the color you pick it can look sporty or luxurious. Only change I would recommend is different daytime dashboard lighting on some gauges"
pontiac,solstice,2006,Jill Yingling, 06/06/2009,Chrome Tire Rims,3,"My Car is 3 1/2 years old, and I do love it.  I have 14,000 miles on it now.  However the tire rims are chrome plated.  I just found out that my front right chrome rim has shredded inside making the interior of the rim like shredded razor blades ruining my tires.  It has ruined two front tires which cost about $325.00 each. I would recommend not getting the chrome tires and I am calling Pontiac GM on Monday and I hope they replace the tire rims and check my other three tires for the same problems.  My first flat tire I almost had a serious vechicle accident. The entire tire shredded.  The dealership would not tell me the reason why this happened.  This is a serious danger to Soltice Drivers."
pontiac,solstice,2006,Eic, 06/22/2010,Nice ride,4,"My Solstice is my first convertible after years of dreaming of owning a convertible; of ANY kind. I have driven and researched many kinds of convertibles. The Solstice turned out to be a real deal on many levels; since Pontiac is no longer in business the 1st year production models became something of a collector's item, it's fun to drive, easy to maintain and affordable. No disappointments. A cool car and I just love it in RED.  "
pontiac,solstice,2006,G.R, 12/23/2005,Not real impressed!,3,"Everyone has been in a daze about the Solstice.  It's not nearly as good as the 2006 MX-5, but my daughter wanted one.  I will probably be getting myself a MX-5 when they get the one in i want.  Anyway, the only things the Solstice has is great looks. It's a little softer in suspension than the MX- 5, but it is comfortable.  The worst thing about the Solstice, in my opinion, is the wind with the top down.  Oh, trying to take the top down and then putting it back up is just to technical.  Solstice 6 - MX-5 10. I wish i would have bought a MX-5."
pontiac,solstice,2006,CJ, 02/25/2006,It's so cute!,5,"I just love this car! I just turned 40 and this car is turning heads daily!  Someone stops me to ask about it all the time.  Nobody knows what it is; a Porsche, BMW, Jag?  It looks much more expensive than it is.  Love the styling, the way the interior just wraps around you and the when the top is down I'm in heaven!  My husband is so jealous, but hey, he has his Harley, and now I have mine!  Hair in the wind, seats two and has just about as much cargo space!  It is so much fun to drive!  My only complaint is the lack of trunk space, but that hasn't stopped me from Costco runs!  You'd be surprised how much it can actually hold!  To sum it up, GREAT car, much better than the Miata!"
pontiac,solstice,2006,2d- 2.4 liter, 08/10/2007,Hot Car!,4,I love my Solstice. It looks better than my 99 Corvette hardtop. I have done several things to make it different than others. I am thinking about putting a Hahn Turbo and maybe a hardtop also. Mine has just about ever option. I have not had to take it back for anything up to this point. Very good quality and really fun to drive. The most fun car I have ever owned. Buy one you'll love it!
pontiac,solstice,2006,pmack, 09/25/2007,Better than I imagined,4,"Okay, maybe I was expecting to be somewhat disappointed when I bought this car, well let me tell you, I am still somewhat shocked that it has surpassed my expectations in every way. First off, after 18 months of ownership, it's style and looks still turn heads just about anywhere you go. So don't expect to get lost in traffic. Secondly, it's ease of handling and control, especially on winding roads, makes you want to drive instead of it being a chore. Knowing the only available engine (4 cyl.)I knew it's limitations.All in all, for the price I could not have done better. Sadly, with 3 kids (17-22yrs.), and my wife who feels much younger when she drives it, I must wait my turn. I need 3 more!"
pontiac,solstice,2006,CavalryScott , 10/24/2007,Iraqi reward,5,I saw the reviews before the car was produced. I knew I had to have one. I waited 8 months and it was worth it. It screams at me to drive it. The most fun car I've ever owned or driven. Car sat for a year in the garage while I went back to Iraq. Now I'm making up for lost time. The perfect weekend toy.

This is my 5th convertible to drive - one Corvette, a Cabriolet, and 2 Miatas, and this is by far the least reliable car I've ever owned in my life. Yes, it looks great. Yes, driving a roadster is fun. Yes, it's a guy magnet. But I'm even debating to keep my car."
pontiac,solstice,2006,barefoot67, 01/25/2010,do not buy this car,3,i would warn anyone against buying this vehicle. I bought mine a year ago with very low mileage and still in warrenty. recently I noticed the service airbag light coming on and also that i could not get the car into 4th gear. took it to the local GM dealer and was told it would cost $700- $800 to fix the airbad and another $1500 to fix the transmission. I am looking at $2500 or more to get the car back to where i can sell it or trade it. the car has a rough ride and no trunk at all. it is not a very practical car. they said the transmission is made in Taiwan so no telling how long it will be before i get parts or my car back. this is a nightmare. stay away from this car. 
pontiac,solstice,2006,Esther Quement, 07/21/2018,Sassy Sexy Car,4,"It sits low to the ground.  Driver must be cautious driving these days because of the larger cars visibility to the Solstice.

pontiac,solstice,2006,andldvor, 06/26/2009,Learning Experience,2,"Owning the car was fun, obviously it is nice to look at and definitely attracts attention. Before this car I was use to smooth riding coupes or sedans so this was a change in road feel. I realized that I enjoyed driving a smoother ride much better, so am going to trade it in. i also purchased the manual transmission which has become a hassle now that i live in a city with endless red lights. I felt like the engine stuttered a little at times in third. It has never broken down on me or anything like that, but I definitely miss a bigger four door car with a smoother ride. "
pontiac,solstice,2006,CG, 01/19/2006,Great new car,4,"Had the car for a month, average 24 mpg driving in mix conditions. Very happy with it. Handles great. Seating is very comfortable especially compared to other 2 seater convertibles. Monsoon sound rocks. Power is plenty for my type of driving. Raising/lowering the top is easy and takes about 30 seconds. I have been able to carry groceries, just not Costco shopping."
pontiac,solstice,2006,Linda , 02/23/2006,The best car since the 65 cobra,5,"I fell in love with the boby style then when i got the car, i fell in love with it even more. It handles great. Stops on a dime and the looks i get from other people is well worth everything. If you haven't bought one yet then shame on you, but good for me."

pontiac,solstice,2006,Kokomo, 11/04/2006,Solstice ex,4,"I have driven the car since 06-06-06. I like the way it handles ice, cornering, passing, and the feel of the road. I was surprised at the power of the 4 banger, without the super-charger. For the price, it is a great buy. I like the way the top folds down and the cleanness of the design with the top down. I wish there was room for more misc. storage, but this is a small thing. I am planning on driving it to Florida in Dec. this will be a good test of the drivability and gas mileage. "
pontiac,solstice,2006,curlygirlie, 12/13/2006,10's,5,"This is the most fun car I've ever driven. It gets looks left and right, everyone wants to know what kind of car it is. Since there are so few in my city, (around 7) it's like belonging in a secret club. The solstice gets excellent gas mileage, has enough pep to forget its only a 4 cylinder and is so fun to drive that I get excited to drive anywhere."
pontiac,solstice,2006,J Langley, 03/01/2007,On my third battery in shop now,3,"It's a sharp looking car and I did really love it. But, it's been in the shop three times ( its there now). Its just stopped running when I was going down the road. Wouldn't start the next time and the last time all the light started flashing and it died. Next time it will be a lemon and I'll get an attorney. It just cant be trusted. I'm a women and I don't want to be stranded. "
pontiac,solstice,2006,Buzz, 05/13/2007,I just got it,4,"I have had mine only 1 week now, so some of the above questions couldn't be 10's only cause I haven't owned it long enough to test the gas mileage. But I  plan to do so.  Loving this car in automatic transmission. I bought it with 8500 miles on it fully loaded for a steal. Mine is an eye catching agressive Victory Red, driving it reminds me of the Pontiac Fiero I once owned. This car far exceeds that car. Maybe next year's vacation will be me and my Solstice making the run from Boston to Phoenix."
pontiac,solstice,2006,9966, 10/31/2007,Solstice in Michigan,5,"I debated between the Solstice, Mazda, and Sky. I had a car on lease, and let the lease buyout sway my decision. I now have a 2006 Solstice, it had 3,300 miles when I bought it. I now have 8,000 miles and am totally happy. My only regret is it has very little space for anything except me a passenger and a couple cups of coffee. I had the opportunity to drive it  on a 500 mile trip, and love it. Top is easy to raise and lower, and tight as a drum. I wanted a fun, sporty, stickshift, good handling, quick sports car like the old MG's and Austin Healy and that is what I feel I have. I kid Vette owners it is a halfavette - cylinders, size, and price! But a lot of fun."
pontiac,solstice,2006,Patrick Dumpe , 03/29/2020,Fun to drive car,5,"The Pontiac solstice should never be thought of as a daily driver! It is a fun to drive car! It has very little storage space and space is confined in the cockpit. I bought it to replace the motorcycle I gave up! And it has replaced it well! It doesn't have very good straight away speed but it corners like it's on rails! Something I was looking for! Gas mileage is about the same as as large cc motorcycle but you have a fantastic stereo system, heating and cooling as well as cruise control! I would suggest buying one of these as opposed to a motorcycle! "
pontiac,solstice,2006,kevin, 01/04/2009,The Solstice Rocks,4,"Overall I love the car, however GM should have worked on expanding the leg room for the driver and the passenger.

I put a deposit down 1/17/05 and took delivery 10/17/05.  9 month wait.  It is everything I had hoped for and more.  Its hard to put it away for the night, I want to keep on driving.  500 miles in the first 3 days of ownership and I have hardly been out of town.

pontiac,solstice,2006,Bruce, 01/03/2006,"Fun, waiting for sun",4,"I have had my Solstice for several weeks and truly enjoy it. The car's build quality is the best I've seen in an American car. It handles extremely well and has more than adequate power.  I test drove a Porshe Boxster, Mini Cooper S convertible, Mustang convertible, but decided to buy the Solstice instead. I'm not sorry.  The car is gorgeous, particularly with the top down and is very fun to drive, especially on twisty roads.  It is a bargain at the list price, but many dealers are charging much more.   "

pontiac,solstice,2006,Art Schuetze, 12/13/2005,Pontiac Solstice,4,"Truly a significant vehicle. It is tops in design. I loved the original Corvette, Mustang,T-Bird, and Cougar Convertible design and this is the most significant since then. It is a pleasure to drive. There is no perfect vehicle, but with the styling this one is a knockout. I am 6'6"" and I fit decently in it. I tried the Miata when they first came out and there was no way I could fit in it. I bought the vehicle in Red at no extra cost. I had originally set myu eyes on a basic PT cruiser Conv. in Red, but they don't make it in Red, you have to pay an extra $6000 to get it in the tourning class. Hats off to Bob Lutz and Pontiac for a fabulous and resonably priced Roadster.   "

LOL ... but I  am  not in it for the speed (I am  65) I have had people follow me  to a  stop to find out about this car ... many thumbs up on it on the highway ... I it the  MG of the future..To grocery shop you need to leave the top up .. NO TRUNK space ... or put groceries in the other seat. Now  I am  still trying to figure how you get the battery out of this car someday..needs more speakers...I  love this car.
pontiac,solstice,2006,Shelia, 01/04/2006,My Solstice,5,"I have driven Pontiac for over 15 years.  I think the Solstice is one of the sexy car they made. She smooth, she hugs the curves, and I love the way drive and all the looks I get from men as well as women when I put up or stop at a red light. I like fast sexy cars, at first I was a little hesitant about the speed being that it was 4 cyl, but after her for a spin around the block, I realize the speed she had and I love this car.

I love my car, all my friends love my car and my wife likes my car.  I'm also meeting a lot of new people because of my car.  This car does not drive like you would expect a small car to drive.  The stability is great and it sure does hold those curves.  There is not much trunk storage space but who cares!  I just love to drive those back roads and stay off the freeways.  I thought that it would bother me to have to drive my new car so much but I'm having trouble staying out of it!  I look forward to those warm, sunny winter days so that I can put the top down and cruise!"

pontiac,solstice,2006,Joey, 01/21/2006,Solstice Rocks!,5,"I get more looks in this car than I ever did with my 2 vette's that I've owned.  Love the car!  Looks great, handles great and is a roadster size vehicle that is fabulous to drive."
pontiac,solstice,2006,Dan, 02/05/2006,My new toy,5,I debated whether to go with the Solstice or new MX5. Now that I have received the Solstice I'm so glad I decided on it. The car is exceptional in every aspect. 
pontiac,solstice,2006,my soul, 02/07/2006,Here is how I see my car,5,"OH MY GOD. In 2002 I was devastated when Pontiac stopped making the Trans Am, but HELLLLOOOO Solstice. Sure it doesn't have the muscle power of the TA but so what. There is not a better way to feel as one with your car and the road then this sporty little roadster. I'm hooked."
pontiac,solstice,2006,Rob Laughlin, 02/22/2006,Phat Girl By Rob,5,This car is hot.... She turns heads everywhere she goes. She has better curves than alot of models. My wife took it to wash and a guy stopped to ask her what kind of car it was and said he had never seen one. She said it was his lucky day. While still trying to dry the car off a girl and guy apologized for staring and she that was ok because 3 fellas across the street were doing the same. Great Car!!!!
pontiac,solstice,2006,Lisa Jeffcoat, 02/26/2006,GM has Nailed the Market -SOLSTICE,5,"This car outshines anything I've driven or even seen on the market,GM really went above, and why to even compare to the others is silly. It handles as close and my  1981 corvette,easier to park than a vette, and the gas hand seems to never move. The innovative features are so easy to operate and storage is just enough for a road trip. This car is Blows away any other car in my book! The seats are so comfty and plenty of leg room and head room, it's just a stylish beauty and I predict it will hold its value,we will look back on it like people look at Corvettes now in 10 to 20 yrs--and WHAT a GREAT price--I just LOVE mine."
pontiac,solstice,2006,L.BROUSSARD, 02/25/2006,the car my wife does not let me drive,4,Very proud owner of this fine looking car. The car gets a lot of stares male and female. It's the type of car that is new to the eye. Owned the car for three days and already someone was wanting to use it for a Mardi Gras parade. 
pontiac,solstice,2006,Wright, 02/26/2006,It was worth the wait.....,5,I saw this car when it was introduced in 2002 at the Detroit Auto Show. I knew I had to have one! It is everything I imagined and more!
pontiac,solstice,2006,Anthony, 02/27/2006,Wife Love's it!,5,"We got a Solstice for my wife, She totally loves it.  The dealership called as soon as they had one the color she wanted. Picked it up that evening, rode home with the heat on and the top down. I took it in for its first service today, the car is great, a lot of fun to drive and people stop and look when we go by. Amazingly quiet with the top down, I was expecting way more noise.  Hug's the road, just a fun car to drive on a curvy road or in and out of traffic."
pontiac,solstice,2006,pugman, 03/01/2006,What a fun automobile with style!!!,5,"The car is more than everything Io expected in a roadster.  I looked at several, all ore expensive, while they may have had a few more features, the all laked in overall appearance. The interior layut is superb.  easy to use and reach controls."
pontiac,solstice,2006,Rich , 03/10/2006,What a car!,4,"The Pontiac Soltice is the most fun I have had, driving a car. I didn't know how to drive stick shift when I got it, but it was so easy to learn, took me a couple of days. I like the fact that the red line for the rpms is high (7,000). I previously owned a Pontiac Grand Am GT which was a 3.1 V6 engine and it doesnt hold a candle to the Soltice performance wise.  The bigger wheels and tight suspension makes you feel like your in a race car, and for the price you can't beat it."
pontiac,solstice,2006,Captcrzy, 03/23/2006,"Solstice, Wish I had gotten the auto.",3,Had several loose bolts on the plastic inner fenders. Carpet not tucked in the front passenger seat. Chip in exterior paint.  Manual transmission is very noisy and hard to shift when cold.  Other than that great first run for this car.  I think it's the best looking Pontiac ever.  Get lots of stares and second takes.
pontiac,solstice,2006,z-man, 03/22/2006,gasser,4,"This has been a great car to drive so far and turns a lot of heads. Handling is great & very tight, but gas mileage is worse than I expected.  The convertible is easy to operate.  The stick is not smooth to shift at times but OK otherwise (don't expect a Porsche feel).  I'm glad I bought it and I've had a Corvette before.  This is more fun and looks even better. It's got character.  No spare tire :-( Trunk?  What trunk?  But then who cares? Bring on the summer! "
pontiac,solstice,2006,solstice, 03/28/2006,pontisol,4,"transmission makes ""clunking"" sound when shifting to 2nd and third.  Sounds like housing may be loose????"
pontiac,solstice,2006,pa, 04/07/2006,PS review,5,Fun to drive. Easy handling. Fairly quiet. Sleek design. Good gas mileage. Able to manuever in traffic easily. Some blind spots need getting used to.
pontiac,solstice,2006,Jim, 04/06/2006,A real head turner,4,"I bought this car in January and have enjoyed it more every time I drive it.  It handles very well and has sufficient power.  Contrary to popular belief, you CAN store some things in the trunk...small soft things.  My only slight complaint is that there is no hole big enough to hold a cell phone or ipod near the center console.  Overall and excellent car though."
pontiac,solstice,2006,Bert, 04/20/2006,Pontiac home run,4,"Picked up in Wisconsin and immediately left for Georgia.  Not designed for a long trip, but FUN anyway.  I tried the Mazda and this one has a LOT more leg room for me personally.  Also, there is a ton more head room than the Mazda.  This car is a load of fun to drive.  Especially with the top down.  I'd agree that the interior is a little cheesy and clumsy.  Exterior is great.  This is the first GM vehicle that I've ever bought (Currently own 4) that met the EPA rating as listed on the window.  Got about 32 on the long trip from Wisconsin.  For daily cummuting in Atlanta traffic, I've averaged just shy of 21."
pontiac,solstice,2006,rosebud, 04/21/2006,Love my Sol,5,"I know, Miata keeps winning the performance tests.  Well, they've also had 10-12 years to get it right. the Solstice is the most highly tested new vehicle in recent years. if the 2006 was up against the '05 mazda, Sol would win hands down.  Mazda knew Pontiac was putting this baby out, so Mazda beefed up the engine.  Pontiac is doing that next year.  Mazda hired the guy who designed the Solstice.. body change for Miata in the near future?  This is becoming a true rivalry."
pontiac,solstice,2006,primecutmeats, 04/21/2006,fun for everyone,5,"this car drives out well except for one thing,when shifting it klunks with a rattle noise,when took back to dealership they said that is normal for this car & the saturn."
pontiac,solstice,2006,John Swanson, 04/21/2006,Great car for price,4,"I could not be more pleased with my Solstice. Now, I am not a car nut, knowing all the tech jargon, but I can tell you this is a fun car to drive, and the style, design and grace are over the top. I have people straining their necks to see what I am driving. I have perfect strangers stop me and ask about the car. I parked next to a Boxster, and someone came up to me and said he would take the solstice over the Box any day. The handling is great, you are the road. OK, It doesn't have the zip of those costing $15,000- $20,000 more, and the cup holders set behind you are stupid. But the non auto top is easy to put down and back up. Best car for the money I have ever bought. "
pontiac,solstice,2006,HSFX31A, 04/21/2006,"SOLSTICE - FUN, FUN, FUN!!!",4,"The only other sports car (if one can call it that) I've had was a Lexus SC430.  The Solstice is much more fun to drive, much better looking design and gives you the pleasure of driving a vehicle that is one with the road ... a GREAT feel!"
pontiac,solstice,2006,BP, 04/24/2006,Top Down Fun!,4,"Fun is the name of the game.  You spend all your driving time looking for roads with curves.  Of course ""Top Down"" is the way to go. The interior suffers from a lack of nooks and crannies to put stuff but it is driver fiendly as far as visibility and reach goes. Don't expect off the line screams but the wieght distribution gives you G- force thrills. Have fun!"
pontiac,solstice,2006,solsticeSJA, 04/25/2006,MY SOL,4,This is the prettiest vehicle i have ever owned. It turns heads and gets smiles all the time. It handles better than anything I've ever driven (and I've rented some nice cars in Vegas) It has NO trunk space but if this is it's only flaw at that price....you gotta have it.
pontiac,solstice,2006,Ron, 04/26/2006,Another Toy for my colection,5,Took from April to Dec but was worth it. fun to drive and the ladies love it. I drive it more than my Harleys.
pontiac,solstice,2006,marksviper, 05/06/2006,Shop Around,3,"I own a 350 z roadster and love it. But if you do the research  most of the new so called hot rods only have a 4 cyclinders in them with only 5 gears no 6th gear. On the highway this is taxing on a engine. I, in a heartbeat, would have bought a Honda S2000 if it go to a 6c. Honda has won  the last two indys!!! Drive them all before you buy. On the highway in last gear listen to that engine work Markviper "
pontiac,solstice,2006,Darkshadow, 05/19/2006,Driving excitement?,4,"I've never had more fun driving a car, more complements or looks. Handles awsome,could use more torque for starts slow until you reach about 4k rpm.  Information center is nice, make sure to get upgraded stereo if you want any bass, there isnt really much room to put a small sub anywhere.  The tranny is a little clunky, but short shifts are fun. The MPG  is more like 18/24.5 on the freeway, I don't think I've ever gotten more than 25 except going downhill.  Cheap plastic int. and rubber seals. Turns and handles like a champ.  Biggest drawback is absolutley not room for anything, so don't pick anyone up from the airport or have more than one friend!!  "
pontiac,solstice,2006,nick stratso, 06/03/2006,puts the fun back in driving,4,The US auto industry has finally designed and manufactured an automobile that is fun to drive and is affordable.  I cut my teeth on TR3s and this has the same feel with reliability.   I can slide around corners again. 
pontiac,solstice,2006,Thomas Meyer, 06/03/2006,My Wife's Solstice,4,"My wife wanted the Solstice.  However, she likes me to drive.  Quite frankly, it is a lot more fun to drive than I had anticipated.  I'm a longtime motorcycle rider and didn't think a car could be so much fun until now.  It's a beautiful car!  It's so much fun to drive and it works well.  As we had to wait two months longer than expected for delivery, we were becoming impatient and were seriously thinking of the much more expensive BMW Z4.  We're sure glad that we waited for the Solstice.  The power is enough to be fun but a little more grunt (e.g., a V6) would draw even more excitement for this vehicle.  Fuel mileage (29 hwy, 22- 23 town).  It's an American company making a great car!"
pontiac,solstice,2006,Teresa, 06/03/2006,Fun - priced at unbelievable price,5,looked for a fun convertible - fair weather car! the price was right the looks are classic sporty - loads of fun to drive satelite radio to boot! would recommend to purchase this vehicle
pontiac,solstice,2006,R.J. LEEDS, 06/03/2006,SOLSTICE,4,"From the day I took possession of my Solstice, the main problem is people coming too close trying to get a better look. "
pontiac,solstice,2006,TROI, 06/03/2006,This car is crazy,5,I love this car there is only one down side to it.That is that there are only two seats.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
pontiac,solstice,2006,Frank Siebke, 06/03/2006,A Fun Car,5,"I drive to the extreme and my Solstice makes that driving fun.  It maneuvers great in traffic.  It has the pick-up I need when moving into traffic and handles like a true roadster.  There is some wind noise, but that makes it a roadster, I want to hear and feel the space around me.  It is just a fun car to drive, and I love the looks I get when we are on the road."
pontiac,solstice,2006,Aaron, 06/20/2006,What a Car Pontiac Got it Right!!,4,For the money you could not get a better roadster than the Solstice. This car rides like a dream handles like a race car. I gotta say Pontiac has done it right with this car. I agree with other drivers when I say Chrome grill would be nice and moving the window controls up closer to the dash would be good other than that dont change a thing on this car..........mark my words this car will be a classic......
pontiac,solstice,2006,Flagg, 06/30/2006,Love it!!,4,"A fun to drive, timelessly styled 2 seater roadster.   Nothing else like it on the road, and it turns heads wherever I go.  "
pontiac,solstice,2006,kramer, 07/06/2006,Best new sportscar in years,4,This is the very best new sportscar available in years!  Surpasses all others for the money.
pontiac,solstice,2006,bobi1956, 07/07/2006,Its My New Baby,4,I bought a white one which I strongly desired and drove 150 miles to get it. It has the two tone interior which I love. It rides smooth and corners well. Great value !
pontiac,solstice,2006,HiloMary, 07/21/2006,Love my Solstice!!!,5,"When I first saw the ad for the Solstice I knew I just had to have one. It's Bright Red with the black top, with the two tone interior and leather seats. It really hugs the road and the sound system is awesome. It is a real ""head turner"" and some people think it's a BMW or a new Ferrari design! Now that's a nice thing to hear. :^) Besides hugging the road it has great handling and I find the 2.4L engine has plenty of ""get-up and go."""
pontiac,solstice,2006,ROBERT BOUCK, 08/09/2006,We love our solstice! Fun and awesome!!!,5,"We received our Solstice 12/21/06,1st day of winter Solstice! We love this car.It is bright red and beautiful, handles like a dream, takes curves,etc. with great stability.The radio is great with 6 speakers and XM radio.Everywhere we go, kids from 4 to 80 yrs. old yell ""Nice car"" or ""I like your car"" as we are driving down the road. People ask us if we like our car because they are thinking of getting one. Of course, we tell them we love it,and they add ""Then we are getting one, too!"" These cars sell themselves.The only disadvantage is the small trunk space, but who cares! We have managed just fine! Thanks, Pontiac for a WONDERFUL ride! It makes us smile just getting into it! YAHOO!!  "
pontiac,solstice,2006,Kent M. Sherry, 08/17/2006,I love my Solstice......a great machine!,5,"There are dozens of sport cars on the market, but none come close to offering the most bang for the buck that a Solstice does. GMC has a real winner in the Solstice. Every place that I go, people want to take a closer look at this stylish engineering marval. Having driven a Triumph (TR3) as a young man, the Solstice brings back old memories. The sound of the exhaust, the increase in G's with every shift of the gears, and best of all the 30.7 mpg that I averaged on my last 200 mile road trip. This car is going to be a classic. While some might stash it away as an investment for the future, I bought my Solstice for fun!"
pontiac,solstice,2006,06solstice, 08/23/2006,06 solstice,3,the car is a blast to drive i have to turn the radio very loud so i don't hear all the squeaks coming from behind the seats or in trunk area  squeaks only when top is down.  i've owned it since 8-06 and needs service already no trunk  cheap plastic
pontiac,solstice,2006,Billdaman, 05/05/2005,Early Solstice Review,4,"This Convertible has it all.  To view this beauty from a distance with its flowing lines and growling grill tells you in your first glance that this car is destined to be a classic.  Enough cannot be said about this car as an embodiment of a ""has it all"" modern roadster.  Its interior is a beautifuly trimed cockpit with high quality fit finish and materials.  This is a car that is the fulfullment of my dream to own a true performance roadster, that is most importantly American through and through.  At just under 20 K there is NOTHING that can come even close.  I have driven the Solstices competition from Honda, Mazda and BMW. They cant match this cars looks or performace at the price"
pontiac,solstice,2006,Don R, 09/06/2005,"Solstice - Great Design, Good Performnce",5,"This car is an excellent value.  At about $23,000 loaded it's got the looks, the performance and the styling that made GM great in the sixties and seventies.  It's fun to drive.  Excellent pick-up and acceleration.  The steering is tight.  Love the 18"" wheels.  At 6'3"" tall, I was very comfortable in the driver's seat.  Lots of room for a small car.  Very little wind noise due to the aerodynamics of the hood, the higher door height, and the rear truck lid design. Top plus is the clamshell design of the rear trucklid.  All controls are within easy reach with great visibility.  Above average sound system with XM radio for the long trips."
pontiac,solstice,2006,ilovmysolstice, 09/07/2005,What a blast to drive!,4,"Got the Solstice about 2 weeks ago and love it! I was going to sell it, but have decided that it's not worth the extra cash to wait until next year to get another.  The car handles as well as much more expensive sports cars, looks much better than most costing far more, turns heads like you wouldn't believe. I have had a few people follow me home to ask about it!  The shifting is smooth and the throttle response is immediate. It could use a little more umph, but all in all is plenty quick.  The people that haven't heard about it can't believe what I paid. They usually guess in the low to mid 30's.  Buy one! "
pontiac,solstice,2006,iluvmysolstice, 09/19/2005,I love this car!!!!! It is awesome!!!!!!,5,"Just received my vehicle a few days ago. i pre-ordered the solstice having only seen and heard about it. now having driven it, i am definitely not disappointed. the solstice handles like a dream. Having been an owner of a few miatas, the solstice has converted me to the Pontiac name brand. Comparing the two, the solstice outperforms the miata in acceleration and handling while having much more interior shoulder and hip room. I am planning on purchasing another for my wife when they become more available."
pontiac,solstice,2006,Bert, 11/10/2005,Outstanding!,5,I have been following this car since it was first introduced by pontiac.  They are very difficult to find and I was lucky enough to find a vehicle that was ordered by someone who decided not to take delivery because he was not comfortable in it.  I originally thought I would use the vehicle as a weekend driver but it's so fun to drive I cannot leave it at home.  If you are looking for a fun affordable car this is the one.
pontiac,solstice,2006,John Carrico, 11/27/2005,TN Solstice,5,"The Solstice is an outstanding investment that is REALLY fun to drive. The Solstice is a lot more than I expected and a far better car than the Miata, S200 or even the Z3. Everwhere we go we are stopped by people telling us how beautiful the car is, and it's even more fun to drive!"
pontiac,solstice,2006,John, 12/02/2005,Could be better !!,3,"I purchased this car not long ago and let me tell you it did NOT completely satisfy me. It has good handling and it looks impressive but it has too many details I didnt like. It has bad wind control,very small trunk, poor turn performance, bad steering wheel, interior is plastic, a hard-to- understand top. It also has just a few of the standard features and even those features are very common and basic. The car has good brakes though and it seems reliable on that. I also found the engine to kind of shake when i shifted gears. As my last comment i would advice that you  also try others before buying it never hurts to stay informed. I would rate this car at a 7.7 out of 10."
pontiac,solstice,2006,admac, 12/06/2005,Love this Car !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,4,"I ordered this car in June, and still have no firm date as to when it will arrive.  So being the impatient kind, I started looking for one on E-Bay.  I got a great deal on one of the first 1000. This car is all and more than what I expected.  Everywhere I go people ask what it is and where they can get one! I bought this as a fun, cruise around every now and then car, but I just can't stand to park it!!!  If you are looking for a great looking small car, but don't need much storage space, this car is for you. "
pontiac,solstice,2006,rkgsx, 12/20/2005,Everyone is Envious,5,"The styling is unmatched.  The color (Envious) looks fantastic.  The performance is great.  Overall, you won't find this blend of styling/performance/fun to drive anywhere"
pontiac,solstice,2006,IronMike, 01/13/2006,Lay Low,5,Don't let anyone find out 'bout this car. Ain't got any trunk space. People slide up to you at a red light and whip out their cell phone cameras to capture images of the svelt lines she shows. It's a real pain. People even get out of their cars when you gas up to take a tour of the machine. I mean leave me alone. I don't need this. My job already slaps too much attention and pressure on me. I don't need this when I drive down to the local 7/11. Other owners say the same thing. Help us. Bad mouth this car. Please... Please... I mean it's an American car... Please help us.... Trash it... O.K.......Please....
pontiac,solstice,2006,My Baby, 4 Weeks old,Excellent Roadster!!,4,"I have had my Solstice for 4 weeks, my first manual car and I love it. The car completely wraps around you when you are in it. Completely comfortable, the suspension is unbeatable. After test driving Mini's and other small cars this one definatly passed the test for comfortable driving.  I love the looks I get driving down the freeway, people slow down so you can pass them and then speed up so they can see what your driving!! Excellent roadster, I can't wait till summer so I can put the top down and really test her out!"
pontiac,solstice,2006,Mikesan, 01/17/2006,Initial impressions,4,"Just brought it home.  At 6' tall and 184 lbs it's a bit tight in the driver seat, but there is plenty of headroom with the top up.  Engine is a bit buzzy and the shifter vibrates when in gear but shifts smoothly.  Drove it conservatively for the 250 mile trip home and got 29 mpg!  Handles like a go kart.  Stopped for gas and two women came up and talked to me about the car.  The first insisted that it was a Porsche.  Talk about a chick magnet!!"
pontiac,solstice,2006,Charles Johnson, 01/17/2006,Chuck's Solstice,5,"This is one outstanding car with fantastic handling.  Currently getting 28 MPG on the road with around 20 MPG in town with an average of 24.5 MPG overall.  I have found out that the car runs better using 93 octane gasoline. Have a total of 900 miles after 3 weeks of driving.  Seats are very comfortable but as reported the trunk has limited space.  With top up I am able to get 3 large duffel type bags and one large soft sided hanging bag, enough for my wife and I to have a long weekend.  With top down, there is enough space for 2 small duffel bags.  I am using the car as a daily driver and regardless of weather it handles great."
pontiac,solstice,2006,Lew, 01/28/2006,What a car!,4,"Forget the small storage space and all the other minor complaints...it's not a $35,000 sports car!  What it is, is a car that is beautiful to look at and fun to drive.  I've had the car for about a month and put about 1000 miles on it. The pick-up is ample the ride is what you'd expect in a roadster...the handling is great. You can't beat it for about $24,000 with most options.  The only thing I wish...is for the weather to get warm, so the top can come down. It's a fantastic car!!"
pontiac,solstice,2006,Jen, 01/31/2006,I love it!,4,"I absolutely love this car! Everyone stops dead in their tracks and just stares! Everyone thinks its a Porsche...I think its a lot sexier than a Porsche personally!  I get harrassed at stop lights, the gas station, you name it.

pontiac,solstice,2006,Kathy, 02/09/2006,Love my Solstice,4,I love my car people stare and ask questions and even stop me in the street.  When I saw my first one I followed the man to see what it was and five days later I traded my 2003 Celica for a Bright Red Solstice.
pontiac,solstice,2006,A Soltice widow, 02/10/2006,A solstice widow,4,"This car made my man's head turn like I have never before witnessed, he actually turned around in the middle of the street to go to the dealership and look at it, and 30 minutes later he was kissing his car good bye and vibrating with the excitment of driving this car...and I am not kidding!!!! He has not gotten out of it except to sleep, the first few days I think he actually spent 36 hours in the seat, incredible!!!! now all I know is there is another woman to contend with...this car is his baby, he gets stopped EVERYWHERE.....even at the Nissan dealership where his son was looking at a Z...the people all asked about HIS car fabulous!!!! I am a Solstice widow now!!"

pontiac,solstice,2006,Joseph Lewis, 02/16/2006,"The only Soltice in Acapulco, Mexico",4,"I bought my Soltice in Mexico City. It was one of only 5 to be sold at the Pontic Dealership there. I own the only black Soltice imported here. Visually it is probably the most spectacular and popular vehicle in Acapulco today. Other exotic cars pull up to me on the street inquiring as to where they can purchase one. It has good takeoff speed, I find it comfortable to drive. But more than this I find my Soltice to a blast to drive. I bought it two weeks before my 53rd birthday and feel like I did when I owned a 1967 sunbeam tiger back in the days when i was a kid. Thank you Pontiac. I am looking forward to the 2007 Solstice coming up."

pontiac,solstice,2006,MICKEY WHITEAKER, 03/18/2006,Mick's Solstice,4,"I love the drive, very fun. It looks much more expensive than it is. I get asked all the time how much it was. Also asked what it is, which is disappointing because I have worked for GM for 33 yrs & GM has not advertised this car at all, no one knows what it is. The body design is beautiful, GM has done a Good Thing with the design of this. The ride is excellent for the small size, I attribute to the large 18 In. wheels on it."

pontiac,solstice,2006,Jack, 03/18/2006,Fun Car,5,"It is a great car to drive. People ask questions about it all the time. They are always saying how good looking the car is. It has plenty of power, and it handles very nicely."
pontiac,solstice,2006,Larry, 03/18/2006,Long range thoughts,4,"I may have been the first to take one of these beauties on a long distance road trip.  No matter what anyone says, this is NOT a vehicle for such an excursion.  MI-FL-MI was the selected loop.  While in FL, it was the perfect ride.  Top down, high sun, friendly girls....it was all good.  Exiting the car at rest areas & having my legs spaz around like I was having a seizure might have been amusing to onlookers, but not to me.  Am I glad I bought this ""Child of Lutz""?  You bet I am!  Will I ever ask it to do something it wasn't designed to do again?  No way!"
pontiac,solstice,2006,Jeff, 03/18/2006,Whoa! Pontiac hit a home run with this!,5,"I'm not one that likes to attract attention with the car I drive, so it's a little tough answering all the questions and turning down the offers people make to buy my car in the grocery store parking lot!  Fun car, I'm looking forward to the summer!"
pontiac,solstice,2006,Jack Reese, 03/29/2006,The One Year Wait,5,When I first saw the Solstice at the dealership I knew that the disappontments with previous attempts to purchase one were rewarded with my patience.  Just walking around the vehicle was a stunning experience.  Pontiac outdid itself on the styling of the fantastic car. I had seen many photos of it but when I saw it in person there was no question in my mind that this was the car for me.  I call it the poor mans Corvette.  After driving it I bought it no matter what it cost.  Great Sports Car. 
pontiac,solstice,2006,John, 04/01/2006,2006 Solstice,5,"This car is a blast to drive. It handles beautifully, as if you are driving on rails.  The ride is not too harsh as in a Porche - this is a daily driver.  Despite being a small vehicle, it is very solid and safe feeling.  My sister bought a new Mazda MX-5; I have driven it and prefer the feel of the Solstice. "
pontiac,solstice,2006,jj, 05/15/2006,new Solstice,5,"I have had many sports cars including three Vetts, MG's, Nissan's and many more but this car I bought for my wife is a great and fun car to drive! Move over, wife, I want to drive and my other car is a Lexus which I also love. We both love this car and it handles like a dream with 19"" eagle low wide profile tires-hugs on turns like no car (not even my Harley) I have owned. I feel like a kid again!"
pontiac,solstice,2006,Two Dice, 05/16/2006,Nice Ride,4,"What a fun car to drive.  If you're going to use the Solstice as an every day car, think twice. If it's for weekends only, go for it!!  Great to hit the open road with the top down and music up.  If you don't like attention, don't buy it.  Turns heads everywhere you go!!  I've always wanted a two seater and this is my first.  I'm glad I waited!! "
pontiac,solstice,2006,Shawn, 05/27/2006,What a beauty!,5,"My wife and I love the Solstice.  It is a great looking car but NOT an everyday car.  Great for weekends and nice days.  Automatic transmisions are sorta rare--but we found one and it is nice to have.  The car handles extremely well and like all the other reviews state--it gets TONS of looks and stares.  Upgraded rims are well worth it becuase it makes it look even sportier.    Indeed, they are hard to find, but orders for 2007 can be placed--and I have heard that will have an extra 60 horse. For the price--loaded and upgraded rims, I beleive the car is well worth it."
pontiac,solstice,2006,Ray Phillips, 06/07/2006,Fun and style,4,Yes I don't have many miles yet. But what a beauty.She has the lines that have other more costly sports car drivers looking. A police chief while we both were getting gas stopped over and marveled at the design. I'm not hoping to see him soon under differant conditions. However the state side boys finally have an American made car we can all appreciate. I think the automatic is fine. This feature helped me sell the better half on the absolute need to aquire this work of art.
pontiac,solstice,2006,Tom, 06/09/2006,Balck Solstice,4,"This is one fun car and it is a definite attention getter. It takes the boredom out of driving. This car takes you back to the grass roots of driving, unlike some of those big ""boats"". You actually drive this car.  "
pontiac,solstice,2006,Claudia, 06/08/2006,Simply Put...FUN!!!,4,"It was hard waiting the 13 weeks to get my 'Deep Blue Baby', but the wait was worth it.  I have the most fun driving with the top down...and I don't mind traffic (sometimes) since it gives others the chance to check 'her' out.  Love the attention 'she' garners.  Hope they keep the production numbers down so that I own something more 'unique' ... and keeps the value up.  Just wish there was a door lock button inside the car... that would make much easier access to unlock the passenger door instead of stretching over or fumbling for the remote.  Other than that, everything else about the car is an absolute THRILL!!!"
pontiac,solstice,2006,DavenJacey, 06/24/2006,Midnight Blue Solstice,4,"Great car...no complaints. It's our reset button on weekends. Only gripe is some wind noise around the seals at the windows when traveling over 55. Otherwise, this car is amazing, and it turns heads! No regrets, especially for the price."
pontiac,solstice,2006,Solstice, 07/13/2006,"Fun, crowed pleaser car.",4,This is a fun car to drive and gets plenty of attention on the road.  Top is a bite of a challenge to fit in trunk when new.  Glad to hear they have a better engine option now.  The car looks like it can go.... but is slow with the base engine.
pontiac,solstice,2006,Randy, 07/14/2006,Fun in the sun!,4,"The Solstice draws stares and starts conversations everywhere I drive. The motor is loud on acceleration with the top up, but with the top down you just hear a nice rumble. The cockpit is small with low access. Comfort is very good. People over six feet tall will have trouble stretching their legs. I find myself looking for reasons to take the Solstice for a spin. The onboard computer rated 20MPG over 4200 mostly city miles. I just took an 800 mile trip through the mountains of New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York. The Solstice handled the twisty mountain roads with ease. The Solstice averaged 30 MPG on this mostly highway trip with the top down the whole way. "
pontiac,solstice,2006,julioga, 07/16/2006,The best bargain ever ...,4,"This car is one of the best looking caras on the street right now.  It's that eye candy and WOW car that arises every 2 or 3 years, like the PT Cruiser, or the New Bettle or the Mini Cooper.  This car is anything but flat.  In South Beach at several valet parkings they park this car in front with the ferraris and lamborghinis.  This is a bold move and not from ford, this time from GM/ Pontiac.  Looks 3 or 4 times it's actual price, girls love it and it's fun to drive, under powered but the fuel economy is awesome.  Let's see if the GXP turbo version later 2006 will handle the performance issues.  This car is a solid 9."
pontiac,solstice,2006,jonna, 07/17/2006,best car out of 160,4,"My husband and I have owned 160 cars in the 30 yrs that we have been married. The Solstice is BY FAR our favorite. We still have a Mercedes 560SL and and Infinite QX4, but I will NEVER let go of my little Solstice. Best fun for your bucks, well built and so far 10k miles worth of reliablilty. Good move Pontiac!!!! Nice to buy American again!!"
pontiac,solstice,2006,m brock, 07/31/2006,most fun to drive in years,4,"I waited almost a full year, and the wait was well worth it. A great car to drive. Not real practical, but great looks, design, a real roadster. There are some quality issues, poor design of trunkspace, window bottons, some skeekiness with the top down, and wind noise from the windows driving on the highway, but i dont even care. I take my blue solstice for a sat am drive every week, to open her up and enjoy driving and shifting gears. I am now even starting to rev past 4000 rpms, to push the car , and it purrs like a car that cost over $40,000. my only complaint is that the dealer raised the msrp, even though i had a contract priced agreed to last year. Everyone will enjoy this car!!!"
pontiac,solstice,2006,houstonSol, 08/11/2006,Solstice making tracks.,4,"For those thinking that this car isn't practical haven't used it as a car to go to/from work. It fits the bill perfectly. And those that are looking for the door lock button, go to the Solstice site and look up a cat named Tweety-he has figured it out. Good guess that GM will be doing this in later machines."
pontiac,solstice,2006,Saul Cohen, 08/26/2006,I love it!!,4,"I bought the Solstice because of its looks -- not because it is a high performance car.  I needed a reward for myself -- and it's surpassed my expectations.  It is a lot of fun to drive -- very enjoyable.  And it evokes great comments.  When I'm stopped at a light or getting in and out when parking, many people stop to ask me about the car or to just admire it and tell me that they like it; I've even had several who asked if they could take pictures of the car. One guy, as a stop light light, couldn't stop raving about what it looked like, and said: ""If I'd seen this before I ordered my RX-7, I'd never have gotten that.""  I do enjoy  it!!"
pontiac,solstice,2006,B Hughes, 08/31/2006,makes driving fun,4,This is my first cont. I wish I had bought one much sooner. The style and fun factor are so high on the Solstice that the shortcomings are overlooked very easily. I love this car.   
pontiac,solstice,2006,toma, 09/03/2006,Solstice Rocks for the Price,4,"This car is so fun to drive.  I had to wait 7 months to get the car, but was worth it.  EVERYWHERE I go, I get stopped and asked about the car.  Sometimes I pretend I am on my phone because the attention is endless! "
pontiac,solstice,2006,Dave Jasberg, 09/05/2006,2006 Solstice Automatic,4,"This Car was designed for people who love the look of 1950 and early 1960 coupes brought over from Europe. The look says ""Lets go out and find a road with curves and hills and see what I can do"" as this is not a Corvette and does not claim to be one, but the price should tell you that immediately. The front has the little whisper of the first Corvettes made with the round curves and grille area. I know that almost al are built as manual transmissions, but I live near the city and shifts become laborous in that atmosphere. For a new design and the first year of build GM deserves all the salutes from the buying public. The first Corvettes were beautiful, but road like trucks and rattled."
pontiac,solstice,2006,Mike, 09/06/2006,Really New,4,"Everyone loves the styling. It is not a blow your head off performance, but it is really fun to drive. I am sure the newer twin turbo would be a barn burner, but I do not need that any more. "
pontiac,solstice,2006,K BETZ, 09/08/2006,Eye catcher/fun ride,5,"Took me 7 months to get my solstice but it was worth it.  Great ride, eye catching, easy on the wallet."

pontiac,solstice,2006,85th PS, 10/01/2006,The Black Bandit,5,Have had my solstice for one year as of yesterday.  A blast to drive and a very fun car.  A great hit with girls.  Seems to be a chick magnet.  Get stopped wherever I am at and ask about the car.  It is unit 000085 and love it.  Would never sell it.
pontiac,solstice,2006,RGD, 11/06/2006,Good driver/short trips,4,"Bought car 02/06.Good driver but very uncomfortable after 2 hrs.Headrest too forward.No leg room. Computer controls on steering wheel very awkward to use. Must take eyes off road to check instruments. LED's hard to see in sun. No storage for cellphone, garage opener, sunglasses, etc. cup holders useless! Very hard to fall into and out of. Not having cushioned arm rest, my elbow gets sore pretty quick. Great looking car. Handles very good and good performing but needs more power. I dislike mine enough to have only 3370 miles on it."
pontiac,solstice,2006,Tim, 11/29/2006,Ridiculously good for the money,5,"This car blows away some cars in the same class that cost $20,000 more.  This car could easily sell for way more and would still be a good deal.  For a two door roadster this car is by far the best looking styling I have seen in years.  It makes other two door cars look girly in comparison."
pontiac,solstice,2006,Matt, 01/31/2007,1 after purchase thoughts,4,"This Car is still a head turner 1 yr after purchase, great styling, although the front end of the car is cute (not aggressive).  Fun car on open roads, performance is good, would like a little more zip.  Comfortable for a 2 hour drive, nothing more.  Interior styling is average with cheap looking dash and door materials.  Overall the concern to buyers is (practical).  You cannot even haul a load of groceries.  The car is always fun to drive and I anticipate this to be a body style that time does not dull.  The aftermarket parts are becoming more prevalent and you can easily customize engine and styling to your liking.  Rear wheel drive is always fun."
pontiac,solstice,2006,CB, 02/21/2007,Beautiful but poorly designed,3,"I loved this car the first second I laid eyes on it.  My first problem began at 3500 miles and the latest just started at 22,000 miles.  The list of items that have required service on the car: radio, leaky trunk, frayed convertible top, noisy top after replacement, a/c (3x), rear differential (still makes a LOT of noise), stuck accelerator.  This car is beautiful but the engine, transmission and basic build are EXTREMELY problematic.  Pontiac will NOT stand behind their product and have given me nothing but grief.  Please think twice before buying!"
pontiac,solstice,2006,mIchMlbrn, 02/22/2007,GM Got It Right (Again),4,"My wife and I were looking for an exotic car without breaking the bank. Corvette, BMW, and another Mercedes were considered. We rode by our local dealership the other evening and WOW, check that out. A Solstice. A friend of mine let me drive his the first day he got it and I wanted one. OK, now I got one and am quite happy with it. The only thing I can say to the GM R&D folks is ""do you think you could shoe- horn in a Hi-Po V6? Overall the car is a blast to drive and handles like a dream. I would much rather own this than a Miata. (I'm an American) The dealership is great to deal with and I am pleased."
pontiac,solstice,2006,Frank, 02/28/2007,Solstice so fun!,5,"After 1 year and 12,000 miles car runs, feels and looks great. Not one Problem to date. Still as much fun to drive as the first time. Great handling and driveablity."
pontiac,solstice,2006,Eric, 03/11/2007,BUY THIS CAR!,5,"Amazing vehicle.  It inspires envy everywhere it goes.  It's acceleration is impressive, to a point (about 85 km/ h).  On the highway it's a typically gutless 4 cylinder, but it IS a roadster after all.  Loving this car is easy, just drop the top on a warm summer evening and you'll understand.  One more point!  Don't let ANYONE tell you that you can't put groceries or anything else in the trunk.  YOU CAN!  Besides, if you're worried about fitting cargo in a car like this, go buy a mini van old man.  "
pontiac,solstice,2006,vwells7957, 03/12/2007,Roadster Fun!!,4,This is the most fun car I have ever owned or driven. I drove it half way across the country this past summer and just loved it with the top up or down. Fuel economy was up around 29 when I stayed at 55-60 mph. It dropped to around 25-26 when I went 75 thru Oklahoma on the expressway. What as smooth ride! I'm keeping this car.
pontiac,solstice,2006,Critter, 04/10/2007,One of 3 Roadsters I have owned,5,"This is my 3rd roadster. Bug-eyed Healy and a Sunbeam tiger before this. Both of them beat me to death and I loved them.  This car rides well, is comfortable (1100 miles in 2 days to the 1st annual convention) and I was not worn out. Have averaged 26 mpg over the 13,000 miles I have put on in a year, with a high of 30 mpg in the flatlands of the midwest.  Lowest was 23 mpg running the dragons tail. This car is a blast on the twisties, and fun around time. Now if people would just quit asking what kind of car it is."
pontiac,solstice,2006,Rob, 08/28/2020,Want to provide “I just bought used review“,4,"I wanted to provide a recent review to help out those looking at a used Solstice. First, there are a fair amount of low mile examples I saw for sale but at higher prices. I found a 105,000 model that definitely shows it was a driver but that’s what I want to do, drive and enjoy.  If I had bought a pristine example; every ding, rock chip or using it factor would crush me. This car already has a bumper crack, door ding and rock chips you’re going to get on these winter affected Midwest roads I live with. The price I therefore paid reflects this. In my opinion this car seemed to have the best “drive & enjoy” to price factor I could find in a roadster type car in my local area.

For those who wonder how a multiple owner 105,000 mile used Solstice has held up, it’s pretty darn good.  Now, owner pride factors will always show and previous owners of this vehicle were not hard “use and abuse” drivers I would say. It did show pretty dirty inside but I’ve personally detailed it and it cleaned up fantastic. Folks complain about all the interior plastic but it has held up well for it’s 16 years, 105,000 miles of use and cleaned up really well. The leather seats are in fantastic condition. The exterior shows more “abuse” or “user wear” if you will. A fair amount of finish scratches, bumper cracks and rock chips can be seen. One thing to watch for is underbody dents right behind the wheels from speed bumps or curb hops! Also the lower front bumper has taken a lot of hits on the ground or parking curbs. This car sits low and behind every wheel, especially the front, you can see the underbody has been crushed up at least a bit from road contact.

The positives are this car still runs like a top, clutch and shifting are still great (it’s a manual) and the steering is tight. Tight like I can’t imagine it was ever any tighter. This car  is a fun car to drive and I’ve had a few sports cars and have driven many more. Speaking of such; folks complain of the manual top. I’ve had two convertibles with power tops that had issues that equated to expensive repairs. Both related to being “powered”. I’m all good with a simple manual top now.

I hesitate to give 5 stars because the design has a few factors, like luggage space with the top down, that could be better to get a 5 star rating. 

Overall I’m very happy with my purchase and plan to “drive & enjoy” this car a lot!

pontiac,solstice,2007,Virgil Wallace, 07/04/2016,4 wheel motorcycle,5,"I'm 68 and was looking for a fun, great looking car like a Cadillac xlr or Plymouth Prowler or maybe a Can-Am motorcycle. I didn't think I could fit into a Solstice but found that I could. The gxp is a hot rod and an event to drive. It rides and drives better than the xlr and the prowler at much less cost. I just can't help punching the turbo... what a blast. I could easily get myself in trouble with the law. Many people complain about the power window swithes being hard to reach... if you reach across your belly with your right hand they work well.

pontiac,solstice,2007,hurricane43, 05/02/2012,IT'S A SPORTSCAR NOT A LUXURY FAMILY CAR,4,"This is a sportscar made for fun not a luxuary car designed for ultimate comfort and convenience. If you want to really get out and enjoy driving a fun car and turn heads this is the car to have. It is reminicent of the 53 corvette with the front end design. It is a blast to drive and has performed very well in the 2 years my wife has had it. I bought it for her approx. 2 years ago and it had 18,000 miles on it and now has 36,000 miles and the only service has been oil changes and replaced tail light bulb(warranty covered that) and replaced a plastic clip on the top that enabled it to close all the way. We both love this car and enjoy getting out with the top down and hitting the road."
pontiac,solstice,2007,Rick Dawson, 12/29/2006,No comparison to 2006 or Mazda Miata,5,"I had a 1990 Mazda Miata; I had a 2006 Solstice.  Comparing the GXP to either of these cars is a mistake. Do not be misled - this is a car built for fun and high performance. I took the 2006 on a long road trip and could not even put a duffel bag in the trunk; I had to put my clothes, sans suitcase, where I could, shoving them into nooks and crannies everywhere. 5 cubic feet of storage space ain't much, especially when divided into small segments here and there.  The 2006 reminded me a lot of my Miata, but I got a lot more compliments, questions and stares. The 2007, however, is a muscle car and a roadster. It is FAST! If only they could find a way to put a suitcase in it, it would rate a 10"
pontiac,solstice,2007,Pam, 01/02/2007,Love it,4,"I love my 07 Solstice it is by far the funnest and best car ever.  I hear people are complaining there is no place for a cell phone.  What the *&% # ??? I am in it to drive not to chat on the phone.  Also that the cup holders are behind you is a complaint, there is one on the passenger side of the consol just have to look for it. Fun car and if your biggest concerns are a place for your phone and starbucks latte maybe you should stick to an SUV."
pontiac,solstice,2007,Ben Painter, 08/28/2010,More than a navy blue toy,4,"We purchased car new with the notion it would a toy for us retired folk. We live mid-way between the Carolina coast and Blue Ridge and soon learned that, despite small size, it is a competent and comfortable. The GXP is equally at home going up steep, curvy grades or cruising flat interstates.  It is short on luggage space but, carrying only essentials is a worth- while trade for the fun.  First gear is a bit short and abrupt for stop-go traffic.  Third is wonderfully long which makes city driving easy.  Fourth is good to 65 MPH.    The car communicates.  Don't look at the tach; listen to engine, feel with the seat of your pants and feet. It will tell you what it likes.             "

She loves the car and we are planning on buying a second one someday so we won't have to share. Location of PWR window switches is the most aggravating thing about this car. I put top up or down in @30 secs at stop lights. Co-worker has base Sol and test drove my GXP and says definite difference :) Been getting great comments on its looks from the beginning:"

This car is classy and just beautiful.  Stands out from the other convertibles and you won't see a bunch of them on the road. Yes, the trunk is small, but so what. If I wanted a ""trunk"", I would have kept my Infinity.  This car hugs the road and just feels tight.  Love it!"

We love the 2 tone interior and the silver color is aptly named Cool.  I put the top up last night for the first time since July 4 and plan on covering it for the winter when the weather breaks.  Our daughter got married this year and we almost did not buy the car - boy are we glad we did!  Everywhere we go it turns heads.  We have had older Corvettes and it is so nice to have everything new and working.  The car handles wonderfully and the fact that storage is very limited is no big deal as we got it for nice days and making memories.  We love the car and plan on keeping it indefinitely!
pontiac,solstice,2007,Maytagman2, 07/27/2009,Second Childhood,5,"@66, have owned 27 different autos including muscle cars, imports, and various eye-catching fun to drive cars.  This ranks as one of the top three cars I've owned. Intend to keep it and pass it on to my grandson when he reaches at least 21...not 16."
pontiac,solstice,2007,MY SOLSTICE, 12/27/2006,A great 2 seater roadster!,4,"I just got the solstice, and i just love it!!  It is good on gas, and very comfortable driving, even though it is a small car. Grabs turns smoothly, and drives very smooth for a small roadster!"
pontiac,solstice,2007,Boomster, 02/04/2010,Had the car since summer,4,"Haven't had any issues with the car at all.  It drives like a dream, and it's just as fun to drive as a Corvette. Hugs the road and you feel like you have total control.  Probably why it's won so many professional drifting events in the past.  Nothing like the top being down. Great stereo system if you have the Monsoon upgrade.  The subwoofer really shakes the passenger, lol  Great pick up and go for the regular trim style. Would love to drive the GXP to see the difference. But it should make most people happy with it's power. I can definitely pass most cars with ease if I need to."
pontiac,solstice,2007,Gabriel1, 03/17/2010,Nothing more fun or gorgeous than this!,4,"I absolutely LOVE this car! Since the moment I brought her home I have been crazy about the way it looks, the way it drives/handles, and the way it attracts positive attention every where I go. This is strictly a ""fair weather machine"" for me. (I do 'baby' my toys!) Nothing more fun than to take this car on a trip to the Napa vineyards or the Pacific Coast on a sunny day or for tackling the mountain turns on a trip up the Sierra Mts to Lake Tahoe! "
pontiac,solstice,2007,vespagl, 03/23/2010,A real sweet ride,5,"This car is all about fun and styling. It handles wonderfully on the twisties and is a real head turner.  It is certainly not a practical everyday vehicle, but in my case it is my weekend toy.  I have had Miatas, and this car is so much more satisfying to own and drive.  (Probably because it looks so darned special, as opposed to the Miatas somewhat mundane styling).  I wanted a vehicle that closely gives the feel of those classic 1960's British sports cars (light, nimble, modest power plant), and the Solstice delivers in spades."
pontiac,solstice,2007,PACMAN, 02/20/2008,"Nice, but not perfect...",3,"Great styling, very comfy to drive. But after 5000 miles, dashboard rattling (dealer ""can't locate source"") and clutch chatters and car almost stalls in first gear.  Has since day 1 and three dealers all say...""designed that way...nothing wrong..try easing away from lights very gently"". Huh?  It's a sports car, for crissake! If I wanted to ""ease"" away from lights, I would have bought a Prius! On the road, driving verymoderately, the car gets about 25 MPG tops at 60 MPH."
pontiac,solstice,2007,Mike G., 12/05/2006,Standard Solstice still Fund to Drive,5,"I picked up my standard Solstice even though the GXP has now arrived. At first drive I felt the acceleration was a little less than what I wanted, but it does actually have good thrust when you need it and step on the pedal to tell it you mean business.  I also owned a GTO, so it is not in that league, but after a few hundred miles in traffic, as this is my daily commuter, I am more than satisfied with the car's performance.  The styling also has created a lot of whiplash around it with craning necks to see what just went by. Nice ego boost.  I will keep it. "
pontiac,solstice,2007,Impe1595, 03/25/2008,Good Looking and HOT!!,4,"For me, it is two things, the styling and the engine.  This car is beautiful and fast.  I don't care that there is not much storage space, or that the top is not so easy to operate, that the cup holders are a joke, that the instruments are hard to see - I don't care! Because even though I will never drive it more than about 7/10's, when I step on it it goes, and it goes fast; and I love the look of the sloping front fenders from inside, and big tires and exhaust pipes from outside.  I'm 65 and I've had many cars; I never thought that I would have anything to rival the beauty of my 71 E-Type Coupe, but this Solstice does come close.  I smile every time I go into the garage."
pontiac,solstice,2007,Celeste1, 09/22/2008,Amazed,5,"I bought my Solstice on March 17, 2007. I traded a Vette for my Sol and don't regret it for one second. I love driving this car! She corners better than any other car I've owned and I've owned about 30 cars in as many years. We took a 3500 mile trip this past July and averaged 32 mpg at 70 mph.  Loved the stares and the comments. This is the best car I've ever owned.   "
pontiac,solstice,2007,Bob Dow, 10/08/2008,Love the Solstice,5,"I grew up with British sports cars and was always hoping to see a design I liked as well. We fell in love with the Solstice. We use it to go out for fun, as a second car, and for day trips, etc.  The handling has been great, it is fairly quiet when driving. The audio is good. We took a 3 yr lease so we could turn it in if we did not like it. We are buying out the lease and keeping. Eventually we will keep it in the family and leave it for the kids.  We had not bought a U.S car for 20 years but the build quality has been very good. No rattles or other problems. "
pontiac,solstice,2007,Nate, 11/12/2008,Great Roadster with power to spare,5,"I just want to drive this car all of the time. Sadly, I will store it for the long Michigan winter soon. I have owned quite a few sports cars and this one takes the cake. This is a roadster in the purist form of the word. I do not care if the top takes me 2 minutes to put up or down. I don't care that it has little storage or some of the swithes are a little hard to get to. I understand and appreciate the car for what it is. And quite frankly, I feel Pontiac and GM nailed it with the GXP. I have owned a BMW M-3 and I think the cars manual 5 speed transmissions feel the same. I wonder if the writers for car mags just don't like to admit GM did it better than anyone else. I love this car."
pontiac,solstice,2007,jdII, 02/04/2009,7/8-Scale Corvette,4,"Ridiculous good looks attract a crowd everywhere I go. Flip off the traction control and make Corvette-like tire smoke. Enduraflex panels make parking lots non-scary. The Eco-Tech Turbo motor is impressive and pulls hard at virtually all RPMs. Very neutral handling posture especially at the limits, impressive brakes. In the final analysis, think of this car as a 7/8-scale Corvette. It's sexy, overt, a little louder and ready to eat GT Mustangs at the next stoplight. Despite the bravado, it is civil enough my wife can drive it and enjoy the car's appeal. Would like to see a few more exterior visual cues to differentiate the GXP from the normally aspirated model."
pontiac,solstice,2007,jim, 01/03/2008,Some of your judgement is bogus,4,"Like the 50's great English cars. As a average driver it is an excellent car in 90 % of my usage. I don't need cornering or any sort of road feed back, I do that with my eyes and feel. I love this machine. I have 7180 miles and still having fun. "
pontiac,solstice,2007,Angioman, 09/21/2009,Aint about romm,4,This car isn't about room it is about fun.  i bought mine used and it had 4500 miles on it.  Everybody's head turns when you go by them.  The chrome wheels and exhaust give it a very good look.  Fuel mileage is excellent averaging 27 city and highway combined. 
pontiac,solstice,2007,Atlantiswaites, 12/01/2010,Perfectly Impractical,4,"This car is great for someone who just plain likes to drive.  This is not for someone who wants a super smooth Cadillac ride, but wants to have a little bitty car, with a lot of performance.  Even though the editor's review of the car talked about lack of performance with the base Solstice, I like it.  I know I would have a lot of issues with grip on the road if I had that GXP (thanks to my lead foot) so I actually like this one.  GREAT to drive."
pontiac,solstice,2007,Gene, 03/28/2008,Great for the Price,4,"I previously owned a Miata and I feel the Solstice out preforms the Miata I had (2000 model).  Complaints about acceleration are unwarranted.  If you read the owners manual, it recommends premium gas.  It definitely is a different car with regular gas.  What the heck with premium you get better mileage, great acceleration and what the heck is an additional $2.60 more per tank vs. using regular considering all that is gained.  Drive it right, treat it right and you've got one great car."
pontiac,solstice,2007,Hauss, 09/01/2008,Reliability needs to be #1 for USA!!,3,"Well we've had this car for 17 months and the darn thing has visited the dealership 22 times. We've had the window seals replaced, ring and pinion seal replaced, axle seals replaced, steering wheel controls replaced, top worked on countless times, and now the transmission is making noise.  This is ONE fun car to drive, get many comments on it. People are always asking what is this? Do you like it? I have a hard time telling them. This is the last American made car I will purchase. We had 3 Infinitis prior to this, never had a problem. Now this, due to me wife just had to have it. I wish they would take it back and put it where the sun doesn't shine. It's just not worth the hassle."
pontiac,solstice,2007,Onefunponcho, 10/25/2008,Too much fun,4,"Pros: The car is the best bang for the buck!! Grips the road like its on rails. Flashes right to whatever speed you need. the small turbo engine makes great power yet still great on gas. The best of everything. The auto tranny shifts like clock work.The premium sound upgrade is dandy with tune you can feel!  

Cons: A bit less hard plastic in the interior would be great. The exhaust is just way to quiet. And the trunk space it tiny.  Hints: Two soft sided plain 24 inch duffels are ideal for the storage compartment. You must pack thrifty on long trips."
pontiac,solstice,2007,Mar, 08/17/2009,Awesome Surprise,4,This was a surprise birthday gift from my husband.  It's a beauty and draws lots of attention.  Ride is almost as great as our Harley.  Our three year old grandson calls it Lightning McQueen.
pontiac,solstice,2007,Coupe, 12/21/2007,My 07 Solstice Review,4,"Car is very fun to drive, however, I have had little problems. I don't drive my Solstice very often. I am currently waiting on a 2,000 part! Luckily I received a 72,000 mile warranty!"
pontiac,solstice,2007,LindaD, 12/28/2007,SOLOVE,4,"This is the best mid-life crisis I could have ever asked for!  I don't have to struggle now to maintain my youth, I drive it!  What an eye- catcher! That's how I fell in love at first sight.  Chased this vehicle down the highway just to see what it was.  Then, I couldn't leave it alone until I got one of my own!  I love this car!  Too bad I couldn't have had this car twenty years ago!"
pontiac,solstice,2007,GM guy, 02/05/2008,Too much fun,5,The Solstice GXP is a great small run around have fun ride. The handling is superb gas mileage if  you drive with care will reach close to 35 MPG around town a good 28 in mixed commuter traffic if you are on it 25 is what I get.  My wife who has not been a sporty car fan loves it! She likes the ride ease of handling and loves the stick tranny. Body is tight no squeaks. The negatives are seat belt is hard to find and it has hard to reach cup holders. On the hole GM finally got it right on fun and price. 
pontiac,solstice,2007,Terry, 10/08/2006,New Owner Review,4,"After three months just waiting to be able to order the car and three more for delivery it was all worth it just seeing it for the first time.  This car is a clasic in only it's second year.  Although it looks great, driving is even better.  The Solstice hugs the road and takes turns with zero roll or sway.  Acceleration with the 2.4 ltr is good.  Wind noise (top down) is minimal and conversation is easy.  Top goes up and down easy and with the head-liner (tough to get) it's very quiet and temperature stable.  Visibility with the top up is limited (bad blind spots).  We purchased the automatic and it's smooth and handles Northern New Mexico mountains well.  At this price, this car rocks."
pontiac,solstice,2007,lester, 10/09/2006,solstice fever,5,"This car is absolutely incredible. i traded in my bmw z4 for this and i couldn't be happier with the decision. when the turbo kicks in, hold on to your shorts."
pontiac,solstice,2007,DELGRECO, 10/20/2006,GM GOING DOWN HILL,2,I received my new Solstice in Dec of 05. It does look good but thats the only thing good I must say. I've sent it back to the dealer about 10 times with problems of water leaks and the rear end leaking oil they kept it for a month rebuilding the rear 3 times and decided that they couldn't fix it right that it would be better to change it. The other problem is the AM radio stations has static they tried to repair it but couldn't but instead for me to live with the problem. The only help GM customer service was willing to compensate is to pay for one month payment on the vehicle. What a smack in the face that was for that the car is paid for. Newer again buy GM .
pontiac,solstice,2007,Aresee, 11/08/2006,Looking to trade it in,3,"I have mixed feelings about my car. I've had the car for 2 months. I love the way it looks, driving a manual transmission convertible can be fun. People in those BMW Z4s always look at me instead of me looking at them now  But the transmission and gear ratios aren't great with this car. Ask anyone that owns a Solstice about ""the clunk"" and the ""differential"" problems that they may have been having. GM claims the clunk is normal and has no remedy for the problem. A/C makes an annoying whine. Rear differential makes an annoying whine  Also be prepared to pay a 3k-6k markup on this car like I did. If you want the car I recommend finding a dealership that will sell for MSRP It will be well worth it"
pontiac,solstice,2007,Barb, 12/20/2006,Turning Heads,4,"Heads definitely turn in this ride.  I'm really enjoying this car.  It's been a long time since I've had a two seater.  The interior is tight, definitely not the car for a larger person. My 6 - ft husband is comfortable. Too much plastic in the interior.  Window switch difficult to get to.  Be warned - the back window is not replaceable.  The entire roof must be replaced should the window break - or in my case - smashed by a jealous neighbor.  Watch the prices - dealers add a significant additional charge for market demand.  Have fun - Enjoy.  "
pontiac,solstice,2007,Roadster 4 50 years, 02/16/2007,Soltice is Superb,5,"Vehicle is everything I expected. Driving position is perfect, There are no 'comfort cupholder or storage issues' for us that critics write about. There is plenty of storage room for creative people. This is ""A ROADSTER"" not an SUV. Handling is better than cars costing double and triple- and I own such cars. Instrumentation is excellent and engine maintenance the easiest on any car I've ever owned, and I still own 18 vehicles, 7 of which are classic vintage British Sports and GT cars. I recommend this car to Anyone interested in fun . It has 'Flash WITH substance' and delivers great smooth and quick (for its class) automatic performance at a reasonable price. "
pontiac,solstice,2007,Smiling Dennis , 11/08/2007,An awesome driving car,4,This is the most fun I have ever had with a car. It is great feeling once I am behind the wheel on a open winding road. The car handles super around tight corners and has outstaning performance. The Solstice is great value for the price and I would highly recommend it to people looking to have unlimited driving enjoyment and loads of fun. Makes one feel like a kid again. 
pontiac,solstice,2007,LimoBarbie, 11/25/2007,Loved my Lincoln Town Car but this car rocks!,4,"I love our new Solstice--wish it wasn't winter in Illinois but we wouldn't have gotten this kind of deal in the summer! Got the car for less than sticker and traded on of my Lincoln Town Cars for it. It handles and corners on freakin rails and makes this 49 year old feel young again and the car has a huge ""Hey Baby"" factor! Hubby got it for me for my 49th birthday and I love it to pieces, I still have my stretch limo and my other TC for when I need a bigger car, but I love buzzing around in this one.  Will be taking it to FL in January for the fun of it--soft luggage fits in the trunk with the top up but nothing with the top down. It's ungodly fast--the cops are hating me!"
pontiac,solstice,2007,halnwheels, 01/02/2020,1/2 year of owning my 2007 Pontiac Solstice,4,"There are basically two models of the Pontiac Solstice... the GXP which is a 2.0l turbo, and the Base, which is  2.4l NA. However, the Base can be REALLY base, or ordered with options. Mine is a base model, but with every available option except the Auto Trans and Traction Control.

I was actually looking at a 1953 MG-TD before I bought this car. I always liked the concept of the traditional English Roadster, but I couldn't get past the primitive nature of it. When I saw the Solstice, I realized that it was a re-imagining of an English Roadster in a modern package. Let me tell you why.

It's strictly a two-seater and it has no luggage space. Sure there's some irregularly spaced nooks and crannies in the top stowage area, but that hardly qualifies as a trunk. It has lots of bits and pieces from other vehicles in the GM lineup, and that's how roadsters have traditionally been created. It doesn't have a lot of power... just like a British Roadster. My Solstice is Green with a tan top... just like the MG I was considering!

I went to buy a luggage rack for the back of the car and the only one I could find that didn't require modification of the trunk was made in England and I had to buy it from there! It uses suction cups of industrial strength and a superior design. The English are very comfortable with the quirks of roadster life!

My Solstice was about $2,000 less than the $12,000 MG I found. Both were in very nice condition but when I really thought about it, I decided to get the Pontiac.

I didn't know much about the options available and I was very lucky that my car had an original window sticker (VIN Matched), so I quickly learned how many options other cars I was reviewing were missing. So my $21,000 base was really a $28,000 fully optioned car. 

I did end up replacing the cam actuators about a month into ownership. I did this myself and the parts cost about $30. No kidding! I also had the torsion springs for the rear deck replaced because one was broken, requiring that I hold it up with my head while I put the top up or down. My body shop charged me $350 to R&R the rear bumper and replace the two springs I had bought for $40.

Now that I've done these things and changed all the fluids (oil, brake, clutch, coolant, trans, diff) I've had thousands of truly trouble-free miles and the car has been reliable and comfortable. Kids love the car when they see it and adults also admire it. It's a good looking car, the kind you might have doodled on a pad when you should have been paying attention in class. Sometimes I think the GXP might have been nice, but I've owned low powered cars before and actually this is more powerful than any of them. If you want to beat people to the next red light, maybe you need a GXP, but that's not what roadster driving is about.

What I like:
Adequate, well mannered power
Electric windows and remote entry.
Standard Shift
Weather tight convertible and acoustical liner
Good lighting front and rear
Awesome looking
Good handling on twisty roads
reliable and reasonably quiet with a nice exhaust note.

Not so good:
Interior stowage and virtually no trunk space.
Hard to out the rear quarters when the top is up.
No compass in the mirror
The gauges are VERY poorly illuminated

I hope this helps!

pontiac,solstice,2007,Mark Elsner, 11/13/2006,07 Envious,4,I'm glad I waited for the second model year as GM has fixed some issues with the first model. My car has the new torque arm between the manual trans and the rear differential. Hopefully I'll never have the clunk that some 06 owners have. The manual trans ratios have also been revised. 800 miles so far and no problems. Mileage is 26-28 so far in mixed driving. The styling is stunning. It gets comments from everyone. Don't drive this car if you don't want to be noticed. The car is far more comfortable than I was expecting. It is not cramped at all. Seats are very nice. Also don't believe all the negatives about storage space. I hauled a 50lb bag of dog food home in the trunk. Great Car!

pontiac,solstice,2007,Fox, 12/23/2006,Funinthesuncar,5,"A little hard to get in/out (5""10, 190 lbs) but for sure worth the effort...really fun and a head turner."
pontiac,solstice,2007,John Richards, 01/22/2007,Race performance and gorgeous too,4,"The looks drew me to the Solstice, but the looks reflect the racing design: the wheels far out at the corners, the low frame and seating, the aerodynamics, the huge tires and disc brakes... all components of a true race car.  I have been surprised at how well it drives, much better than I thought it would.  Cornering is a joy.  The visibility from the cockpit is a little restricted, but I quickly learned how to anticipate visual angles for quick maneuvers, i.e., headchecks and headtilts for mirror views.  Now I feel safe except I have to do a double check for right rear corner views (a good practice with any car).  This doesn't feel like a well-engineered Japanese car.  It's looser and wilder."
pontiac,solstice,2007,JV, 01/29/2007,Best little convertible in the market,5,Fun to drive both with the top up and down.  The interior design makes it easy to use all aspects of the electronics with minimal effort.
pontiac,solstice,2007,wlmbrm, 02/11/2007,Fun in the sun,4,"I've only had my Sol for about two weeks now, but what a fun two weeks it has been!  This car turns head and elicits comments EVERYWHERE I go.  From a pure driving standpoint all I can say is WOW, she hugs the road unbelievably well, accelerates like a bat out of you know where, and handles like a dream.  Monsoon sound system totally rocks and enables you to blow a bunch of the teenagers away (or at least keeps you from having to hear their stereo blasting!)"
pontiac,solstice,2007,soho, 02/11/2007,"All fun, All the Time",4,I waited for 7 months to get my GXP. It was worth the wait. There is so much power for such a small car that I was really surprised. It truly is a sports car in every respect.
pontiac,solstice,2007,¿spoom, 02/16/2007,07 GXP,3,"Too early to tell, as I dropped it off at the dealer last week after 11 days because of an intermittent ""no starter when you turn the key"" problem. I'll test it some more when I get the car back ;) Overall, this is a fun car to drive. The 2.0 turbo took care of the weak performance that kept me from buying the first year's model. Handling is on par with cars costing $10k+ more (I've driven a Crossfire some). Even with cold tires & road on a 11 °F day this thing road like it was on rails-the suspension set-up is perfect,IMHO. I constantly found myself wishing I could reach the seat angle knob while driving but that would take a skinny-armed contortionist."
pontiac,solstice,2007,Dale Devol, 02/26/2007,Solstice,4,"Have been driving for the past 11 months and love it.  Really turns heads when you drive down the road, top up or down!  Handles beautifully but not happy with shift from 2nd to third.  Only wish I had waited until the turbo came out."
pontiac,solstice,2007,Lemon Solstice, 03/13/2007,Lemon,3,"Maybe I am the only one, but I have had MANY issues with this vehicle. Paint rubbed off under the hood, misaligned body panels, paint chips on door due to body panel alignment. A LOT of top leaks, interior squeaks, passenger seat rubbing against door, top making a lot of noise (not wind noise), gas gauge not functioning properly. Knocking sounds from motor, anti freeze leaks, and last but not least power steering leaks. some of the issues have been fixed, others are still pending, and some I am told are ""normal"". Other then all the problems I love the car"
pontiac,solstice,2007,Houston, 03/04/2007,Aching cheeks,5,"Awesome just awesome, my cheeks are aching with smiling so much; power comes on stream when requested. Handling is so precise it compares to a Porsche I used to own. Practical, no, but who cares, looks, comments and questions from kids to grannies. Even in the traffic here in Houston I have been questioned while stopped. I read someone saying the seats were small, I am 250 and 6 ft. (and 56 years old) and slide in and out with no problem."
pontiac,solstice,2007,garync, 03/13/2007,Garync 2007 Solstice GXP,4,"I drove my GXP very conservatively for the first 500 miles, but after that I opened her up. I am amazed at the power and handling for a car in this price range. I have owned several Corvettes and a big-block SS Camaro. Obviously the GXP is a different type of can, but it is a blast to drive."
pontiac,solstice,2007,06-Sly-Fulload, 03/24/2007,"Fun, Fun and YES Even Practical",4,"BMW, Mazda, Mercedes - you have a lot to learn...drove them first..BIGGEST disappointment-BMW...ugly & NO FUN.. buy one as a coffin maybe. Anyway..the Solstice is what a Roadster is supposed to be at a price that is right on. I got it loaded with the upgraded stereo - I like to say ""I have a pair of driveable headphones"" !! Just awesome stereo. Comfortable to drive, rips around any offramp - zoom zoom this...tried that with the Miata - almost wound up dead! Tonight I went to the post office picked up 3 boxes size of a briefcase cubed, went to the market - $140 groceries and I had room to store it all. Used front seat of course, but I never have problem putting stuff in the trunk. It's a HIT!"
pontiac,solstice,2007,Cathy P, 04/26/2007,"Sad to say, but a bit of a disappointment",3,"The car is a great looking sports car. Possibly the best on the market. But looks are deceiving. It lacks in power and interior design.  The radio and XM are wonderful. The two toned interior is beautiful but I'd lose the cheap plastic. As far as power, it's a dud. The exterior design is gorgeous but not practical when driving. There are too many blind spots which is dangerous.  The soft top is cumbersome to put up and down. When the tops up visability is worse. I traded in my 2007 Solstice for an MX5 which was way more fun to drive and roomier.  "
pontiac,solstice,2007,LuvMySol, 04/26/2007,A great little car!,5,"I just purchased my GXP after waiting over one year on my dealer's wait list. I never thought I could ever feel this way about a car, but I am in love with my Solstice! It is everything I had been expecting it to be and more! This is the first time in my life that something that I had been anticipating with so much excitement turned out much, much better than in my wildest dreams. My wife, who never gave much thought about car, just loves this car too!  The Solstice's looks are awesome, and its mechanics seem equal. It is hard for me to believe that this is an American designed and built car, but it is! No trunk? Who cares!"
pontiac,solstice,2007,Nails - TX, 03/27/2007,The Car of Your Dreams,4,"I have never seen so many double-take, jaw dropping, envious stares in my life!  The kind of attention I get is only matched by exotics.  The car was bought for my wife to run around in. She LOVES it. I LOVE it. EVERYONE loves it. Pros: Everything.. Style, Performance, and Price. Cons: Not a Family car! Gas mileage is on the low side, 16-18 straight city/ 27 HWY. Somewhat limited trunk space (although I have stowed an entire grocery basket full of groceries). "
pontiac,solstice,2007,Roy Wainscott, 03/29/2007,My 2nd Solstice,5," I've recently traded my '06 Solstice for the '07 GXP. I really was not that concerned about more power to begin with but then I was really turned on with the new feel driving hilly and curvy backroads. This one feels different, like a better control of the road, I love it. To all of those who complain about no storage space, don't buy this car. Go get yourself a pick-up truck."
pontiac,solstice,2007,elkhunter, 04/24/2007,Solstice GXP,4,4000 miles so far and no problems to report.  Average mileage is 27.4 in split city and highway miles. The car is fast and easily manueverable. Lots of stares and comments by everyone around the car. Now enlarge the trunk and add a power top and all is right with the world.
pontiac,solstice,2007,pontiac lover, 04/20/2007,Great new ride,4,"This is great vehicle. I test drove the roadster, which was great, but when I test drove the GXP I just couldn't resist. I was set on a new sedan until I got behind the wheel. It's even peppier than my '04 Grand Prix GT and handles great. Very fun, very unique.  I just wonder what it will be like in the winter."
pontiac,solstice,2007,tr6jag, 05/10/2007,2007 Solstice GXP,5,"After 900 miles on the Solstice, it is a fantastic driver. The handling is awesome, the performance is fantastic, and the build quality is beyond my expectations. I purchased it not as a daily driver but to replace a '69 Triumph TR6 I should have never sold. Regardless, the Solstice is heads above any 2 seater I have researched and driven. It's great to have no oil spots on the garage floor! Too bad the weather hasn't been better here in VA to enjoy the Solstice more. There have been no mechanical or negative issues with this Pontiac since I have owned it."
pontiac,solstice,2007,Doc, 05/14/2007,Vs. MIata,4,"As a Miata owner for the last 15 years, I can say this is more car for the money, however there are some quality issues with some of part fitting, although minor and probably hard to notice, I was used to the perfection in the fit of the Miata. The good news is this rides like a much bigger car, and is more fun to drive than the Miata."
pontiac,solstice,2007,chuckford4, 05/30/2007,"Oustanding, fun car",4,"Very solid vehicle from Pontiac. Lack of storage space is the only major setback. Performs well once in 2nd gear. Had a miserable buying experience with the dealer in Atlanta, but has been a pleasure to own. Better on gas than advertised, about 22-24 around town and over 30 on the hwy. Very good handling and styling, premium stereo is solid even with the top down at hwy speeds. "
pontiac,solstice,2007,Steve & MaryBeth, 06/25/2007,Another Roadster at Our House,4,"This car replaced a 2001 MR2 Spyder which repalced a Miata this is MB's car and she hasn't stopped smiling yet. Our first drive was to Mid-Ohio Races. There was a very nice surprise awaiting us. GM had a Pontiac corral there that we were invited to join. I own other sports cars,Porshce and a  Corvette but we have never seen so much enthusiasm and passion for any car as the people that own the Solstice. This was exciting and very refreshing. We are looking forward to many fun miles with this car."
pontiac,solstice,2007,1 Bad nanr, 07/13/2007,Bless my SOL,4,"I have looked at this car for some time and finally bought one. It is my mid life crisis car. The 2.0l turbo is a kick in the pants. There have been many posting on the interior and use of to much plastic which does cheapen the apperance. The manual trasmission seems very smooth within the first 3,000 miles on the car. I have owned a few sports cars over the years, but this by far, is the funnest car to dive that I have owned."
pontiac,solstice,2007,dangerdarrell, 07/17/2007,GXP,4,I have 1600 on my GXP now. Having problems with the clutch.  1st gear is too low (5 speed).  I advise 6 speed for town. Clutch will be repaired under warranty. Love the car. I have owned many sports cars but none have gotten the so many compliments. Would buy another even after having the 1st gear and clutch problems.
pontiac,solstice,2007,Dean in MI, 07/20/2007,2007 Pontiac Solstice,4,"I've been a Nissan owner for years but I loved the look and performance offered by the Solstice.  I have been very pleased with the cars handling, braking and performance.  I'm not happy with the lack of change holders, the difficulty of viewing the speedometer and the seat controls.  Also it's hard to see traffic lights or go through a drive-thru with the top up."
pontiac,solstice,2007,J, 08/28/2007,Lots of fun,4,"The car is outstanding and lots of fun to drive. This is definitely a roadster true to it's sportscar heart. It feels like and drives like the experience you are looking for.  If you want something to turn heads and zip around town, this is the best bet for your money. Don't be looking for a daily driver or a traveling vehichle. You can squeeze golfclubs in if you buy a small bag, but don't expect to be carrying luggage or moving large items from home."
pontiac,solstice,2007,Dean, 06/25/2007,Not a bad American made car,4,"A stable, fun to drive car with lots of good features and only a few not so good. I enjoy it much more with the top down than up due to the poor visibility with the top up. Gauges are hard to read and the seats are odd but as soon as the turbo kicks in it brings a smile to my face."
pontiac,solstice,2007,Pamke526, 07/02/2007,I love my Solstice,5,"I just traded my 2007 Solstice for a 2007 Solstice GXP and I am in heaven!!The regular Solstice is a great little car, but the GXP is really fantastic! I got the 5-speed manual transmission with the GXP and boy is it awesome! I am already getting 30 miles a gallon in the city!"
pontiac,solstice,2007,bradbike, 08/05/2007,GXP in Triad,4,"I own the car and I really enjoy it. It's quick, fast, and strong, but still averages 25 mpg in the city and 32 on the highway. I have the automatic and it's pretty darned quick itself. If you can find the GXP for MSRP or close, you'll be in for a treat. It's not a great primary car due to lack of storage, but it has more than enough for groceries and typical shopping. If you buy a large boxed item, make sure you don't have a large passenger...it will go in their lap. As for the top....you've all heard horror stories about reviewers having a hard time...sorry, but I feel they are cry babies. The top is easy to operate...it just requires you to get out of the car. Get one! Have fun!"
pontiac,solstice,2007,Rich, 10/10/2018,Never taught her how to swim!,5,"Lost this 2007 Solstice in hurricane Florence w/less than 20k on this prime conditioned fun car, will miss my top down trips to the beach.  Insurance may allow for another beach car I hope.

pontiac,solstice,2008,pilot601, 02/21/2015,Great Sports Car,4,"After selling my convertible Corvette two years ago I started looking for something to take its place. 
I found a 2008 Solstice that is white with a black top just like the Corvette was.
The Solstice is actually more fun to own and drive. It's sporty, quick and just a fun little car to own.
The Solstice has awesome lines and performs like sports cars three times its price."
pontiac,solstice,2008,hypno1dr, 04/06/2009,The Quiet Storm,4,"With cat-like agility and blistering acceleration, I just love my solstice gxp.  While driving from San Diego to Las Vegas and staying fairly close to the speed limit (which is difficult) I actually got 33.1 mpg. As far as the manual top, I can pop it down faster than most automatic tops.  As far a putting it back up, it takes a little more time, but still, its not that hard and I don't mind.  Yes it does have animalistic head turning looks, and yes it gets a lot of attention from the ladies who want to ride with me. Guys if you want a babe-magnet car, with blistering acceleration, and hurricane force winds with top down, this is the beast (i mean car) to have."
pontiac,solstice,2008,bill45005, 05/28/2013,feel like a kid again,5,"Bought this car , a week ago and WOW!!!! I have had my fair share of great fun machines over the years , just to mention a few , 65 GTO convertable , a triumpth gt6, 69 firbird transam,a grifith (289 hi po with webbers etc it was a rocket ship)etc then I went into my big 4 wheel drive phase lol, the last of which was an avalanche 3/4 ton with 8.1 motor, so I have had experance with many hipo machine , but have never had any more fun than this car has given me . it is the scca model 2.4 5 m
I bought it for a resonable cost and it only had 7,000 miles on it and gm certified car it is absolutly flawless . The fun I have already had is great ,top is not a big deal to put up or down "
pontiac,solstice,2008,Carl, 07/13/2015,Perfect for a weekend for 2,4,"My wife and I where looking for a little 'mid-life crisis' fun - we are both in our early 50's.  I had previously owned a 1974 Fiat Spider in my youth, so we looked at used re-conditioned Spiders - while from a nostalgia stand point it seemed fun, it wasn't practical - too many modern bells and whistles missing.  We came across the Solstice on at a used sports car dealer with a good reputation - in really well kept shape and low mileage for a 2008 (30k) and attractive price.  Very happy with it - we didn't need top end performance , but it is sporty, turns heads  and a fun weekend play 'toy'.   Stowage for gear isn't the greatest, but we can get what we need in it for an extended weekend get-away - a small duffle bag, camera and a couple of lens.   Well worth the price we paid, decent gas mileage and alot of fun.
"
pontiac,solstice,2008,John Bruning, 09/15/2008,Lack of Storage Space? Bunk!,4,"We've got 3,800 miles on our '08 GXP. It has gone through deserts, an Idaho sand storm, crossed mountains in flash- flood conditions and has shined in every situation. Two rebuttals on criticism: 1.) Some critics say the manual tranny is rough and hard to shift. When broken in at about 3K, it becomes butter-smooth. 2.) No storage space. Bull. You just need to know how to pack. I just took our GXP on a road trip to support a SWAT team's training operation. In the GXP, I had a large camera bag, tripod, large duffel with a week's change of clothes, gun bag, laptop bag, and ten blank-firing pistols, rifles and a shotgun. Plenty of room for all!  Treat yourself: buy a GXP!"
pontiac,solstice,2008,ccaffrey, 06/13/2012,This is my favorite toy.,5,"Ever since I first seen this car in a magazine, I thought that it was the most beautiful car that I had ever seen.
Having to always have some kind of muscle car, I didn't buy a Solstice until they put the turbo in it.
Then, I installed a K&N filter and finally, I had the GM turbo upgrade kit installed.
Now my 2008 GXP will scream.
Imagine 300 hp in a go cart.
I love everything about it except, no spare, not console, no trunk space and the location of the electric windows.
My Solstice is Blazen Oranage and I had tinted windows installed and that little touch really added to the beauty of this little screamer. Garage kept in winter.
My every day car is a Toyota 2012 full loaded FJ."
pontiac,solstice,2008,Paul, 05/02/2009,This is what I've wanted a along,4,"Magazine reviewers have lost the perspective of being an actual owner of the car.  This car makes me feel 25 years younger and, for the first time, strangers actually look at what I'm driving. Even had a couple take a picture of it!  It handles like better than any car I've EVER driven, accelerates on a touch, and stops evenly and when I want it to.  For a big guy like me, it's comfortable and reasonably roomy (for a roadster, that is)."
pontiac,solstice,2008,edgar robertson, 08/02/2009,Solstice GXP love affair.,4,"This car is very well received at any local show and shines, and parades, that I have entered it in. I have never found that lowering the top is a problem. And, I routinely complete the task, in 15 seconds. Raising it is only slightly more time consuming, requiring 28-30 seconds. The power window switches could have been better placed. I would have preferred wind up windows, and side pockets. The cup holders, I really could care less. A bigger trunk, would be a great help for weekend touring. But with some creative packing, two can go on a weekend cruise. I also, do not require A/C in a roadster, and would have appreciated the weight savings, and possible extra horse power. Stereo 1st class!"
pontiac,solstice,2008,Wanda, 03/02/2010,excellent,4,I have never had any problems. Always get the oil changed and car maintained at the given times. Fun car and I am sorry the car won't be made now in the following years. Good buy with fun results.
pontiac,solstice,2008,Rojo-GXP, 11/23/2009,A wonderful car,5,"I'm proud to say that I have had my red GXP for almost 2 years and have had 29000 trouble free miles. I have the GMPP 290HP tune, a cold air intake, and Solo Performance catback exhaust and it makes for a VERY quick car (0-60 in 4.9sec) and it's a very sexy ride. Parked beside BMW, Porshe or Mercedes cars and it will ALWAYS generate more nice comments and turned- heads. Sad that 2010 ends the run of this little car. GM got it right at the end. Maybe someone else will continue the line. If you want a great- looking fun-to-drive car with the most bang for the buck, this is it. "
pontiac,solstice,2008,G. Kline, 06/25/2010,Great car with some small irritations,4,"I've had a base model for over 2 years now. I'm very happy with the performance, handling, and gas mileage. The car is beautiful and I've got some great and interesting compliments on it. It is great fun and I love it, but there are some bad points. As several others have said, the interior design is lacking. No storage space, bad cup holders, the temperature control is one of the worst I've seen (should have been more like my 2000 Firebird). I don't know why people complain about reliability. I have over 60,000 miles already (fun to drive, daily driver)and have had little to no problems. Too bad Pontiac folded, GM needs to keep producing these some how."
pontiac,solstice,2008,Terry East, 01/16/2019,Solstice for Singles,4,"This is a sports car. It's small and fast, holds the road very well and gets above 30mpg most of the time. It is not a family car, it has very little storage either in the trunk (that's where the convertible top folds away) or inside the cabin. But it is fun to drive to work every day and I also take weekend trips in it. There are a lot of small plastic parts on the car that are starting to break. Mostly connectors that hold all the control pieces for the top in place.

So after a year, nothing much has changed. Car is still fun to drive and still too small to carry a lot of gear. During this year I've had to replace my top when the back glass came loose. Other than that, no problems noted.

Another year gone by and still fun to drive. I love watching the turbo boost gauge spin up! Had to spend close to $2k for a brake control module, brake flush and new battery this year. Had intermittent TSP and ABS lights coming on. It's fixed now and working just fine.
"
pontiac,solstice,2008,Guitargal, 04/08/2010,2008 Pontiac Solstice,5,Honestly - I love this little car!  I drove a 4-runner for 10 yrs - loved it! Traded for a 08 Cadillac CTS - felt like a grandma.  didn't handle like I thought a $40+K car should. My little Solstice is perfect for downtown driving/parking.  It handles well - I don't have a turbo - so have to wind the gears - but I'm cool w/that - and it doesn't seem to mind either.  I scratch the tires - every time I get a chance! LOL
pontiac,solstice,2008,swankytigers, 10/07/2013,First Car,5,"I received this as my first car when I first started driving, and I can honestly say it's been the best car I have ever driven. For 15k, you get an engine that feels just as powerful as a 911. It has very sexy angles that perfect it.
Go pontiac! "
pontiac,solstice,2008,Gene G., 01/25/2010,Not Fun,1,"I drove this car for two years.  Continually took it back to dealer for various leaks.  Handled terribly compared to my Miata.  Poorly and cheaply constructed.  After two years I could see this car could not be relied on for the long haul.  I sold it and bought a Honda Civic which is solid reliable, much better milage and handled more like a sports car than the Solstice.  Good ridance.  Stay away from."
pontiac,solstice,2008,New Roadster Owner, 05/30/2008,My First Roadster,5,"The GPX is amazing! This is the first roadster that I have owned and I am very happy with my choice. The Solstice is the only car that I have been able to drive comfortably. I am a large person (6 ft 325 lbs) with a very long torso. Other cars I have looked at did not have the hip room and head room that I needed. The Solstice has both. One other car I looked at had so little room, I looked OVER the windshield when seated in the car and I could not close the door because it hit my leg. Other than being very comfortable in the Solstice, it is really fun to drive. Other reviews complain about the meager trunk space, all I can to say is this car was only meant for hauling - well you know!!"
pontiac,solstice,2008,Rwilson, 06/26/2008,Had to have one,4,"Got the 08 after seeing it on the road.Did my research first. Back cup holder OK with me. The driver side holder needs improvement.  Plastic  looks fragile. Airbag light too obvious on dash.  Auto trans. works for me, shifts great. Chrome grille would class it up. Would like a removable luggage rack for the back. Could have included door pockets but would sacrifice width. Perhaps a netting to hold odd and ends.  Mirrors a little too small.  Good sound system with 6 deck CD.  My mistake was getting it for my wife.  I don't like to beg.  Put the SUV away until winter. "
pontiac,solstice,2008,Steve, 09/13/2008,Finally!,4,"I've been in love with this car months before the first '06 ever hit the road. It was the day before I was to pick up a pre-owned 2008 G6 GT I had just purchased when I was told I just received a pretty substantial pay raise. That was it, it was finally my time!! 4 days later I was driving home my Brazen colored Solstice. I love this car. This car is sexy as hell and IMO blows the Sky away in the looks department. It's a blast to drive and never fails to turn heads. My only regret is I purchased it with only a couple of months of driving days left before it gets put up for the winter. That's ok - between employee pricing and end of season blowout they knocked $5k off the MSRP - what a steal!"
pontiac,solstice,2008,pegboy, 02/22/2009,I'm in love,4,"My father told me to buy an S2000 and my brother said Miata, so I bought my Solstice. I have never enjoyed driving anything as much as I enjoy taking the top down and cruising in this. It is beautiful, sporty, roomy enough for what I wanted, and most deservingly a head-turner. As for the car critics 'not enough room, interior needs better styling, needs more power and handling,' don't get me started. If it were up to the major critical magazines and publications we would all be driving BMW's and Mercedes anyway. For less than 22K out the door, with rebates and employee pricing, I am fully satisfied and laughing at the Z4's and Kompressors. I think I'm gonna buy my wife the coupe. The top needs no improvement. I timed myself with no help other than my buddy pushing start on the stop watch. 10 seconds to lower the top, 8 to put it back up. Tell me your automatic put-the-car-in-park tops can do that."
pontiac,solstice,2008,Happy camper, 03/03/2009,Solstice Advantage,4,I have always been a lover of the Old Vets but have never been able to buy one.  The solstice gives me the ability to afford a fun car to drive with out costing me a fortune.  I love driving this car and enjoy the looks the people give me when I drive by.  There is nothing practicle about this car but that is the reason I bought it. It looks great and is a lot of fun to drive!
pontiac,solstice,2008,lovemysolstice, 10/22/2009,I LOVE THIS CAR!!!!!!,4,"I bought my new 08 Solstice(base) 5 weeks ago and am loving every minute of it. Most of the reviews list similar negatives which are true, but as for the storage issues, lack of a spare tire, fussy top operation, plasticky interior and ridiculous cupholders, etc..., I would not want any of these items improved if it compromised the beautiful looks or low price of the car. Performance in my base model, while nothing exciting, is adequate. I am 6' 215 lbs and the car is plenty comfortable, although I am wishing I had gotten power windows, due only to the fact that the window crank protrudes in to the area where my left leg rests and is a bit uncomfortable. Did I mention that I love this car?"
pontiac,solstice,2008,AJ, 08/14/2007,Almost there!,3,"I purchased a red 2008 GXP last weekend. This car has a lot of potential with a few changes. Interior materials are ok but not up to the same standards as the MX-5. Trunk space with the top down is non-existent. The manual gearbox should be improved to minimize the effort required to move between gears. The best way to describe it is clunky. Despite these drawbacks, the car is a lot of fun to drive, gets a lot of attention from admirers and is fast."
pontiac,solstice,2008,LimoBarbie, 08/07/2009,Lovin' Every Minute of It!!!!!,4,"I love this car! 1 sexy machine with a huge ""hey BABY"" factor. I'm 50 and it makes me feel 16 again! Has every option available, wicked fast even with the auto tranny and I've shown a lot of STUNNED 'Stangs and BMWs tire smoke and tail lights (got the performance upgrade so it's hotter than the reg one) and I had to buy a radar detector because I'm a very bad girl!!  Loved my Town Car but after driving TCs for a decade I wanted something HOT-smooth sexy curves and the adorable eager-to-run expression on it's little buck-toothed face makes me smile every time I see it. A real head-turner that folks swear must be an import and blazing speed to keep this old gal happy!  I love him SO MUCH!!!!!!"
pontiac,solstice,2008,Lisa, 08/04/2007,Hot Car But Needs a Chrome Grill,4,"My previous car was BMW Z4 3.0.  So far, I really like the GXP's performance. The exterior is hot! My only beef with the exterior is the black grill -- it looks cheap!  Why not keep the same chrome grill as the Solstice?  The interior is sleek -- the seats hug you.  However, there is no storage space.  I can't even find any place to keep my garage door opener.  I've noticed that the window controls are in an awkward place -- inevitably, my elbow triggers the windows. The biggest pain is the manual top -- miss the Z4's automatic top.  There is no trunk space with the top down.  Wish they offered navigation system as option. But can't beat the price and bravo to Pontiac for its cool design!"

As well as it handles and is magnetized to the road its hard to let anyone but me drive it. I purchased the car knowing there wasn't much storage space in it. Didn't buy it for storage anyway, as far as the cup holders, wouldn't care if they were there or not. Glad theres not an ashtray, gives me a reason not to let friends smoke in my car! "
pontiac,solstice,2008,Danny, 06/21/2008,2008 Soltice Automatic,4,Love the car and the way it handles. The red is a great color and the car gets a lot of heads turning. I have had so much fun driving this car with top up or down. All around fun to have. Have had no trouble out of this car.
pontiac,solstice,2008,John Bruning, 06/30/2008,Heroin with Wheels,4,"The 260 HP Solstice is the most addictive driving experience I've ever had. This car is like mainlining heroin to an auto enthusiast. Quick and agile, but packing plenty of power and kick, the Solstice GXP offers a visceral thrill unseen since the era of the mid-Sixties Corvette roadster. With XM radio, On-Star and enough room in the trunk for an overnight bag, the Solstice is the quintessential date car. I'm courting my wife all over again, and we're having a blast rolling around the back county roads with the top down and a picnic lunch in the trunk.  You can't miss with this Pontiac. Test drive it at your peril. You'll find yourself taking one home with no regrets."
pontiac,solstice,2008,Jim, 06/30/2008,Small Dreams,5,This small car always puts a smile on my face. It is a nice addition to my Harley! Fun for two!
pontiac,solstice,2008,newragtopowner, 07/03/2008,Fun & Great Toy,4,"What a fun car to drive! I don't understand how the ""expert"" reviewers can rate the Sky higher than the Solstice. They are virtually the same car. This is a roadster & therefore should not be considered a roomy car. It would be great if the top were powered instead of manual but it's not difficult to put up & down. I would stop the car to put up & down anyway. "
pontiac,solstice,2008,D Gearbox, 08/08/2008,So Much Fun!,4,"I drive a lake road to and from work every day, it's like a road course, this car is the most fun you can have with your clothes on."
pontiac,solstice,2008,Hypnotized, 08/22/2008,Mezmerized,5,"In 4 weeks I now have 2800 miles. Car is too fun. Did a weekend trip to Laughlin, NV and averaged 31.8 mpg. Noticed many people speed up to see my car, almost as if they are trying to figure out what kind of car it is. Definitely this is a chick magnet. I love all the attention the women give me just for a ride."
pontiac,solstice,2008,Brotzy, 10/03/2008,Too Hot,4,This car is a blast to drive. Everyone stares at you like you are driving a spaceship. Never get tired of driving this car. Stereo is awesome. Speaker behind passenger seat will rock you for sure. I'm 57 and feel 16 when I get behind the wheel. The car is my wife's so I only get to drive on weekends. Should by another for me.
pontiac,solstice,2008,redsol, 04/17/2009,Weekend toy,4,"My wife and I each have one, and they are toys for weekend use. Yes, the guy who placed the switches should be shot, but, in spite of al the complaints from magazine types, we can, with thought, place enough luggage for 2 for a 1 week trip. Just no big bags. There are plenty of storage slots if you look at it, even with the top down.  Mileage is way better than EPA says.  We get 25 mpg in town on both cars. The top can be a pain, but once you get a system, it's pretty easy.  It is a fun car, and handling is great. Took mine to Phx In'tl Raceway's roadcourse and had a blast. yes, the interior design team must have had a party the night before, but the fun factor outweighs the negatives."
pontiac,solstice,2008,KyDave, 06/27/2009,Very Satisfied,4,"After selling a Honda S2000 over year ago I decided to jump back into the vert world.  The Solstice really wasn't in the running until I got the $3000 dollar coupon from my GMCard.  I paid just over 16.5k for a brand new '08 with the wheel package, Monsoon radio (a must), and a few other goodies.  The car stickered at $26,062.  An unbelievable deal and I'm pleasantly surprised with the ride, handling and even the performance of the 2.4 ltr. The fit and finish is great and the materials aren't as cheap as I had expected from a GM product. This may just be the best car deal I've ever made."
pontiac,solstice,2008,Mike, 02/22/2008,08 Solstice GXP,4,"Overall a very well performing car that handles darn near as good as a C6 Corvette, maybe better in some respects.  Fun, and the exterior styling cannot be beat.  Mechanically a very sound design.  Interior needs work as far as convenience, but if you rate it from a driving perspective only, the interior is functional.  As soon as you start adding niceties like where to put your spare change, sunglasses, or cell phone... the interior's shortcomings come to light quickly as does the non existent trunk space.  The exterior design and performance of this vehicle is what sells."
pontiac,solstice,2008,Fullthrottle, 10/03/2007,Head Turner,4,"An exceptional vehicle. Beautiful design(best GM has put together in a while)and always gets the looks. Simple with clean lines. Has that classic roadster feel. The car has plenty of pick up and power, always wants to go. (oh that turbo) So easy to spin those tires. Has pretty solid handling. Storage could be an issue for some. Interior is like a cockpit. Clean in design. Cup holder placing is in an odd spot(I dont use the 2 on the back wall. Stereo has great sound, love the mp3 adapter. Seats on the GXP are great, road trips have been really comfortable(Pack light). "
pontiac,solstice,2008,louis chad, 11/09/2007,I feel 16 again- thanks Pontiac,4,"I just bought the GXP on my 60th birthday and it has totally jump started my life. I live in northern Minnesota, but will use this care selectively all winter. You just can't store this one. It will, although be in a slab heated work shop with me. I'll visit the wife on weekends if time permits. Thanks again Pontiac."
pontiac,solstice,2008,happy owner, 10/25/2007,2008 Solstice,4,"This is a great car! The handling is great, no front end wandering, takes corners like they are not there. The fit and finish are teriffic, I worked in the auto industry for 30+ years and know about fit and finish.  Have always driven GM and had two bad cars when GM had the quality issues, but those are gone and the product is now excellant. The styling looks good - we have had comments of ""Cool car, Good wheels, Love your car"" from teens and adults.  You can ride with the top down at highway speed and carry on a conversation, and we do not have the opt. wind screen.  With the top up wind noise is non-existent, just the soft rumble of the exhaust.  A pleasure to drive!"
pontiac,solstice,2008,KAR, 10/31/2007,2008 Great Car,4,"The 2008 Solstice is a great car and fun to drive. This year the acoustic headliner, 1 year of OnStar, XM radio, input jacks, are all standard. The handling is also great with the Stabilitrac system. The exterior design is second to none. "
pontiac,solstice,2008,gxpowner, 03/14/2008,this is one sexy little car,4,i have hardly any regrets in buying this little jewel. there are some little quirks that i will address just because they are aggravating. the engineer that thought to put the radio power knob in the center of the radio where your hand hits it every time u shift into third gear must surely be proud. same goes for the mute/power button radio controls on the steering wheel. their placement turns the radio or sound completely off when hit.side mirrors r way too small. but...this is a head turning car that turns heads...they r just trying to figure out what the colored streak is that just went zooming by....lol
pontiac,solstice,2008,Jim Menefee, 03/27/2008,Jims 55 Birthday!,4,"My wife gave it to me for my 55th Birthday.  I have owned 5 - 240, 260 and 280 Z-cars.  When you reach my age you either get a Harley a Sports Car or an exercise bike.  I chose the Solstice... Nothing can touch it ... it's fast, feels like a million dollars and really gets the looks.  Could not be more pleased!  My other choice was $20K extra on a BMW.  This beats the BMW hands down!"
pontiac,solstice,2008,Danny, 05/11/2008,2008 Solstice,4,I just bought the solstice and I love it. The ride and handle is great. The inside a little cramped and the cup holders are in bad locations. Not much storage anywhere so don't go shopping on this car. But over all I love this car.
pontiac,solstice,2008,ehc, 05/24/2008,Greatncar,4,I've had no problems with my Solstice. The transmission is the only drawback -- stiff to shift and poor choices in gear ratios.

pontiac,solstice,2009,passkey, 05/05/2012,New 2009 GXP,4,"This car had only 2,600 miles on it when we picked it up in Florida two weeks ago.
We drove it back 1,300 miles to upstate NY. Fun experience is at the top. Seats are comfortable but soft top noisey on the road. No storage to speak of but, we brought our supplies in duffle bags.
Suitcases are out of the question. Some items can be place behind the seats but only with seats slid forward. 27.2 mpg driving highways and speed limits.
Small gas tank (13gals.).
The turbo engine is super responsive. It does get the looks and positive comments from friends. It fits the bill for what we were looking for. A 2,600 mile trip in two weeks.
Top speed 145 & 0 -60 in 5.5 sec. (haven't confirmed either)"
pontiac,solstice,2009,auto teacher, 03/04/2010,My first year,4,"I am 5'9"",165 lbs. male and find the car very comfortable. I have had no failures with the vehicle. I added an aftermarket wood, dash kit and shifter on my automatic trans. The power,window switches are just wrong and the top is a little difficult, but compared to my old MG's not that bad. I know some complain about the trunk, but it works for me. I love the car. I find some of the buff book reviews to be strangely biased towards the Miata, but my GXP is far ahead of that car. Too bad GM was mismanaged into eliminating the Kappa platform, but I got one and plan to keep it around for a while."
pontiac,solstice,2009,Richard Lund, 09/24/2016,Solstice Overall,4,"This is a very stylish little car.  The fit and finnish is very good. Like it's look from every angle.  Top up or down.  Plenty of power, great handling, very good brakes and we have power windows, locks, air conditioning which is very adequate and I love the 18 inch tires on this little car.  Holds the road amazingly well.  Had a Corvette before this and I get just as much pleasure from this.  I think Pontiac did a great job on the design, fit and finish of this car.  Who knows what would have eveolved if Pontiac had stayed in business.  It seems to be economical and service at other GM dealers shouldn't be a problem.  Love the Bluetooth, on-star and CD player.  Lots of technology considering this is a 2009 vehicle.  Have since moved it to Arizona.  Had it serviced at the local Buick dealer and was very pleased on that process.  Looking forward to enjoying it in the cooler winter months.

pontiac,solstice,2009,Elnathan, 11/18/2009,Happy ending,4,"I have admired the Solstice since it first appeared. I realized recently that, to buy a new one, it was now or never. Couldn't be happier. Impossible to find comparable beauty in a new roadster for under 150K. Sure, there are a few shortcomings (cup holders, etc.), but every time I am about to get irritated I just get out of the car and look at it a while. It is supremely beautiful. Even if such transcendent looks could ever become a visual cliche, it will never happen because so few Solstices are going to be around. My wife and I have had seperate cars for some time, but she just announced that she considered the Solstice to be OUR car. It does that to people."
pontiac,solstice,2009,halnwheels, 09/17/2019,Recently Acquired Base Solstice in 2019,4,"Having owned 2 Fiat X1/9 cars (bought new) back in 1978 and 1986, I have returned to the roadster with my recently acquired 2007 Pontiac Solstice. 

This is simply a sexy car. No doubt about it. Everyone loves it when they see it. As cheap as people say the interior is, it seems suitable for the purpose. You can also add on wood or some other surface treatment to the interior pieces.

But the exterior is gorgeous. The proportions of height and track width are pure Pontiac. The softtop is good looking up, and tucked away is even better.

Let me say something about the model classification, What are you buying when you see the car advertised as a Base Solstice? You have no idea, that's what. You have to know what options were available and what are on your car. I was fortunate to have the window sticker for the car I bought. There were $6,000 of factory options! And that didn't include the automatic trans because this is a standard shift. It has everything that was available in 2007.

The power available is adequate on the NA model. You won't win any drag races, but good driving skills can yield results that will bring a smile to your face. 

Trunk space, Hah! This could have been done better, but I'm not sure it could be done without sacrificing the car's concept. 

The soft top is a troubling point. It's very complex, perhaps unnecessarily so. For all the solenoids and cables and flip open doors, they could have made it electric! I can't imagine anyone except the owner to sort this out when it starts to give trouble.

But I'm loving it. It's rewarding to feel the car respond to steering input. I approached a sharp hairpin turn that I am familiar with and rounded it with careful balance. As I came out of the turn, I needed to move from the right lane to the left, and letting off the throttle and back on did exactly as I wanted. The car just nosed into the turn a little deeper into the turn and changed lanes without a protest from the tires. 

Go get one and have some fun. Watch for the options!

pontiac,solstice,2009,IOB, 02/10/2010,I hate it!!!,2,"I regret every buying this car! Sure, it is fun with the top down and driving on weather permitting outings, but otherwise it stinks.  My car has been in the shop three different times and had a camshaft sensor problem that was repaired. The motor seems sluggish IMO and it is fairly quick, but seems harsh for a turbo. Power is not a smooth delivery. Clutch is quirky with a notchy shift linkage.  The damn thing is horribly uncomfortable and interior is cheap at best. No room for anything.The top execution could be much better.  The car is not what I expected. Fuel economy on the highway is good and it looks good, but otherwise I hate it!!!!  I would trade this pain in a heartbeat if I could."

Handles, fast , good fuel economy and it turns heads everywhere I go. My friends all know I can buy a more exspensive car. So they allway ask me why a Pontiac? It's a top notch performer, that's why. Near perfect 50/50 wieght and 260HP add up to lots of fun. "
pontiac,solstice,2009,Gene, 10/11/2009,Kansas,5,The car is more than I exspected. Fun to drive has the power and the sound of a true sports car and its American made. Driving it gives you a relaxed mind set. I don't know about the car turning heads as you go by I'm enjoying it to much!

This car is what you want it to be.. pedal to the boards and 10mpg or out on the interstate getting 40 mpg. I had the power up pkg added and will never regret it. The GXP model is def worth the little extra. My other half just got the 2010 Camaro he ordered so now we're a transforming couple! LOL He got the 426 hp SS...it goes without saying an incredible car that doesn't disappoint, accept finding a place to really open it up!"
pontiac,solstice,2009,Victor Gonzalez, 10/28/2009,Love the Car,4,"I love this car a lot.  Everyday I drive it, I love it even more.  Really fun to drive, and is a pretty fast car.  The car looks great.  I am constantly turning heads when I drive.   The interior is really comfortable, I have driven for hours and have felt great right after.  It is actually very roomy for a two seater.  Interior does have some hard plastics, but it looks pretty good.  Storage is a bit of a lack in this car.  Overall this car feels good on the road, is quick, and looks spectacular.  Manual top is really easy to handle, but would enjoy an automatic one.  Many people complain about the five speed, but i have no complaints about it."
pontiac,solstice,2009,Chris, 06/25/2019,2009 GXP Coupe,5,"The 2009 GXP Coupe was only built for one year. I have had mine for six years and love it. It does however have its flaws as do all solstices i.e. both door handles broke, heating actuator failed twice, gas cap needed replacing, the turn signal lever failed, and the thermostat needed replacing. However, as I live in the Phoenix, AZ area the engine is subjected to considerable heat in the summer many times over 115 degrees in the afternoon. I have 47,000 miles on it and it is now broken in. The gas mileage went up by two mpg when it reached 40,000 miles and it runs much smoother now. The automatic transmission still clunks at times when downshifting from third to second but it doesn't seem to hurt anything. I owned a 2007 solstice and drove it over 100,000 miles with a clunking transmission without any serious mechanical problems other than the usual door handle and heat actuator problems. I am getting 40,000 miles to the OEM tires. The hard top is quiet and doesn't creak unless its very cold in the mornings, once warm it is quiet. The air conditioner is excellent and cools instantly. The battery lasted five years in the AZ heat which may be a record. Overall it is a great car with a lot of power. However, I keep the electronic nannies on all the time as it is a bit wild with everything turned off. Even with everything turned on it is a real handful in the wet, that just makes it perfect for Arizona. One other note I am just over 6 feet and I have two inches of clearance in the vehicle, more than I had in the 2006 Solstice. I also had to replace  the two variable valve timing solenoids but they were only $35 each and very easy to install. It took ten minutes to complete. Because it is a simple car without any electronic screens, cameras, or high tech safety addons there is a lot less that can go wrong. You never have to pull the engine to fix anything.

pontiac,solstice,2009,daveB, 08/23/2019,A sporty little conv' rarely need to brake,5,"Its not the fastest , but handles so well, with a classic point and shoot philosophy.
You look out from the somewhat cramped but i always fit cockpit, over the long hood and sense your about to drive something special. Although the 2.4 is a little wheezy, row the gears quickly, hold gear till 6000 rpm's and changing with purpose and you'll be doing 60 in under 7 seconds.
It loves back roads, and with the little side windows up its not too noisy either.
Once, you understand the wonkiness of the convertible top operation it all makes perfect sense and down gives the car a great line and a completely different look than with the top up!.

I have never purchased a car as quickly as this one. I am 6 ft tall and 230 pounds but I fit into it nicely. It handles good, fast and really catches the eye. I have always liked orphaned cars as I have owned many Studebaker. You either love this car or you hate it. That is what I like about it. It brings out an emotion from people. Cars have always had emotion attached to them. They only made about 1266 total 2009 coupes so they are rare from the start. "

All I've done besides regular maintenance ( tires, brakes, spark plugs, oil and e.t.c) is replace a heater fan van vent motor and an idler pulley. Both were cheap to replace.

I'm not a fan of the styling at all. The engine is really underpowered for my liking, and I have the 4 speed auto. It's a good car though. I've had it for over a year now and all I've done was replace the tires, when we bought the car, replace the brake pads, replace the starter, replace the battery, and an oil change. Maintenance really. I've added a sound system and tinted windows and its a pretty enjoyable ride now. And being 6'2"" I can say that I can fit somewhat comfortably, no longer than 2-3 hours though.

every 2k.  I use synthetic oil and it 
gets better performance.

I would buy another...For the price 
it's a winner!"

After owning the car for four years i hit a three quarter ton chevy and no damage was done (but caved in the door of the chevy. backed into a half ton chevy and no damage. and the last thing is i jumped out of the car and forgot to put it in park and the car ran into the house and it did not receive any damage. we have 112,000 mile and still get 27 miles per gallon. no major problems and scheduled maintance is the only thing we have had to do to it."

I am 6""2 and i fit in is no problem.
It is far more comfortible than I would have thought.
No mechanical problems and the convertible top works perfectly.
When the top is up there is no noise and man is it fast!
With a little 2.4 liter powering this thing
I would have never guessed it but this thing can move.
This is the kind of car I can see having for years and giving it to my kids."
pontiac,sunfire,2000,keet, 03/02/2011,Great when it wants to work,2,"The pontiac sunfire feels like a sporty little car for a four cylinder economy class vehicle.
The acceleration is so-so and the car shakes at high speeds, but this is to be expected.
What is completely inexcusable is how frequently everything breaks down and how unreliable the whole thing is.

This car was used as a daily driver when it was only a few years old, yet within the first year the AC compressor blew out - twice.
I paid for the full repairs.
It blew out again within a year's time.
The shop told me that the compressors were garbage out the factory.
The water pump broke twice in 4 years of light driver.
I went through 3 batteries.
This is all from light commuting!
Garbage!"

For the most part it has been a great car, however I have replaced.....fuel pump, clutch, wheel barrings twice, electrical problems,
radiator twice, many break jobs, gasket cap, batteries, etc....but that is to be expected considering how many miles it has. Over all a good car. It currently needs $600 worth of work done on it so I am now looking for a newer car. This time around looking to purchase a Mazda or a Honda."
pontiac,sunfire,2000,Kenzie, 07/30/2009,Great car and sad thats its gone,4,My sunfire was the first car I ever got and I drove the crap out of it.  It ran great and in the seven years I had it I replaced the fuel pump and breaks.  The other day I got hit by a gravel truck and even with the low safety rating this car had me and my dog walked away from the accident fine.  I'm sad to see my sunfire go and it will be missed
pontiac,sunfire,2000,carlwag, 02/18/2010,Convertible is great,4,"This is my second Sunfire convertible.  My first was a 1995, and I upgraded to a 2000 when I bought this used in 2005.  The convertible top is the best ever put on a convertible.  Real glass rear window and one handle operation make this a snap to put up and down.  Also, this is the only convertible on the market in the last twenty years that can carry five people!  There are three sets of belts in the back seat.  I absolutely love my AM/FM radio, cassette, and CD player.  It puts out good sound, and the AM is far superior to my wife's Acura.  I plan to keep this car until someone else makes a convertible that I like - and I don't see that happening soon."

After having it for 3 years it really grew on me, and it was fun to drive every day. I think the interior is a bit cheap feeling and the seats aren't that comfortable, but it looks great. Not to mention that the exterior styling is BEAUTIFUL. Also I've never had any problems with this car besides the normal maintenance (breaks, oil changes, etc.). Unfortunately it was recently totaled in an accident, however if they still made them I would buy another in a heartbeat!"

I had to replace the transmission and ignition switch (3 times I had to fix the switch, each time I was left in the middle of nowhere with an absolutely non functioning car).  The ignition switch was a warranty recall yet every time it was ""fixed"" it broke down again! I've spent as much as I paid for this car on repairs, it is ridiculous.  I was lucky enough to get rid of it for a trade in on a cherokee.  For a commuter, it got decent gas mileage but when you're constantly worried about being left stranded god knows where, 100mpg couldn't make up for it.  Do not buy this car!"

I still get 28 mpg avg. It has been a good investment; paid off 2 years ago and kept on going.  For a 4 cyl. it goes pretty well, no trouble passing, and travels well at 60+. Had recent starter trouble, replaced it, no problem since.  Also gas gauge seems to be off sometimes, but i've never had it looked at. I live in upstate  NY, not great in snow, but not horrible, however RUSTED a LOT!  I'm not in love with this car, but I wasn't when I bought it.

OK for the price, offers acceptable

now (it has about 40000 miles). I 
didn't really have problems with it 
except that when I stalled (yes it 
still happens :P) the engine had 
problems to restart when hot but a 
visit to the dealer and everything was 
fine. The only thing I don't like about

in the city, even with 5-speed. 

The severe body roll of the GT,
mentioned in the review of SE, is
minimal for the SE. I noticed MUCH more
body roll in other car makers
comparable models eg. Neon, Nissian,
Cavalier (it is similar but definately
does NOT drive the same,). The
Cavalier's steering is not nearly as
tight or responsive, and most of the
standard features on the Sunfire are NOT
standard on the Cavalier.

the Sunfire in general. Sure, if you 
have the SE model, the performance

This car accelerates fast and handles exceptionally well. But after 4 months of use, the engine gave out on me. I replaced the engine and she never drove quite the same. The CD player stopped working after 7 months as well as the LCD display for the Monsoon audio system. You cannot replace the radio head unit because Monsoon wiring techniques.

I skid accross the road into a ditch

Very poor ratings by several other 
people I know who HAD these cars

Not the cleanest lines in a car, but not a boring Civic/Camry/Escort/etc.  Only issues in 8+ years has been a hose replacement, and the vibrations are more noticeable than I'd like, but not bad overall.

It's a look you either like or don't. Plus it's a convertible...those are for rich people these days.  I bought it with a piston misfire, but it was still running. Took it to a shop and got the entire head repaired, everything drained, and told them I would handle the little stuff. And boy was there a lot of little stuff.im not complaining thought, everything is relatively easy to fix and get to in the engine and around the car. It's become second nature and takes seconds disconnecting the battery and air intake to get to the guys. I've fixed the automatic window, changed hoses, belts. Used stopleak and JB weld to fix a big ol crack in the engine block a d it's still trucking and not leaking months later. I changed the starter, bypassed the relay and gave it a pushbutton start, so no problems getting that thing running ever.it was stuck in reverse and was and easy fix with a couple 10 dollar bushings. This car is fun to drive, it's been an adventure and learning experience driving and working on it......that being said, the electrical work leaves much to be desired, the convertible top wasn't taking good care of and I'm currently leakproofing it with liquid gasket, and it also disconnected from the car in the back, probably gonna have to use a whole tube. A lot of little things pop up here and there you have to stay on top of but the car is resilent if you want to put in the work. It also sat around doing nothing for a year cause I lost the key and license was suspended lol.

Only ever need to perform minor repairs (exhaust, shocks, oil changes, spark plugs).
Ice cold A/C, and engine warms up quickly on those cold days. When I got it the two lowest fan blower settings didn't work, but easily fixed by replacing blower motor resistor.
Roomy trunk, I can fit a Tuba in it with a bit of room to spare. Not the fastest car in the world (could only get it up to 105) but it gets you where you need to go. Comfortable seats for road trips."

handling, especially during 
inclement weather. Adequate fuel

I was very impressed with the power from the 2.2L engine. The 5 speed manual trans shifted smooth... even reverse was noiseless. The body design is subtly sporty. Seating could be more comfortable, but that is a minor concern. After 3 months its the gas mileage that impresses me most. Driving a mix of highway & city, it consistantly gets from 31 to 33 mpg! Overall, this Sunfire is the best used vehicle I've ever owned."

I haven't had any problems with it other than needing brakes and a new battery. Always starts right up and have not had any other problems with it.  With the 2.2L engine in mine, its not the most powerful force on the road but it does its job.  If you're looking for something to get you back and forth cheaply, this may foot the bill for ya."

But this car ran like a champ. No fluid or oil leaks EVER and timing CHAIN never failed. Mileage was solid 30's in mixed driving (high 20's with a/c on). Any maintenance was very simple and inexpensive. Tires cheap to replace due to small size. Finally sold it b/c P0440 evap code came up and I decided to put money towards a small SUV (I'm very outdoorsy).

The Strut bearings go bad super fast, but the ball joints and tie rod ends hold up. Very Dependable. it has never left me stranded. I have has the car a long time, and it has 135k on it, still runs like a champ. been child abused, and killed with miles, hardly ever maintenance it, and its still a good car.

They charge double than what it is really worth. Within 4 months I had to put a ton of money into it, the brake pads were bad, tires were bad, it needed ball joints amongst other issues. The reason I went with Car Hop is because they claim to be cheaper (not overall) and they allow you to get liability insurance instead of full coverage. Definitely not worth the price. I do like the look and feel of the car, and everything in terms of air, radio and controls work fine, but the internal problems are far too severe.

Total cost to repair was $480 (Would have been more but thankfully I have connections). I average around 28 mpg which isn't bad for an automatic.

A litany of things went wrong with this car during the first 4 years, worst of all the rotors kept warping no matter what pads and rotors I put on. Of course the dealer told me it was because they weren't OEM parts. Interior doesn't fit together snuggly, I felt like I had to fall in and climb out of this car, speakers rattle, passenger door not aligned right which was fixed by the dealer with a sledge hammer, very sluggish turn when starting, visor broke and flaps leisurely around while driving and its so loud in the cab that there is a feature that raises the radio volume automatically while driving certain speeds."

I liked how this car handled and it did me good until about 85,000 miles when all of the standard things tend to go wrong with lower end cars. I needed to fix the struts and the rotors kept warping no matter how many times they were replaced. But like I said, my car was paid for by the time that started happening. For me it was well worth the investment. I like how the car handled- nice tight steering. It may not have been the moost comfortable ride, but it was a trooper for a good 8 years before it started going downhill.

One of the issues is the Headlights. They don&#8217;t put out much light when on high beam. This car squeaks and rattles down the road, and it has TONS of interior problems, including the seat not being able to adjust without breaking, and controls sticking.  I had problems with paint pealing and problems starting the car. Plus this car bounces all over the place on uneven or bad roads.

Only things I've ever had to replace (besides tires/brakes) was the water pump and snake belt, which together was only 250, and the alternator went out this year and was 300. That's less than 600 for all the wear and tear I figured I have put on it. If it hadn't been for the storm I could've most likely driven this car another 3-5 years. Gonna miss, that is for sure. "

pontiac,sunfire,2002,Jeremy, 01/20/2005,The way to go,3,"I love this car... if you know how to drive and use a stick I can cruise past BMWs or Lexus's like they were standing still.  People complain of body roll but if you're smart and dont take an inside lane you're fine... besides when you roll up in alloys and tints you dont need an $80,000 car to get the girls"
pontiac,sunfire,2002,West Marcus, 01/26/2005,My second Sunfire,4,"This has been a fine vehicle, doing what I bought it to do. I am also customizing/ pinstriping it, body wise; installed a catback exhaust, KN air intake and getting the GM Supercharger in the next month or so to soup it to 200hp. Had a problem finding a dealer to install it. I enjoy the roof and the stereo/CD is fine. I am tall and leg room is very good. It is a fun car to drive as well as economical."
pontiac,sunfire,2002,Traded It, 09/07/2005,Traded It In,2,"This car got me thru college but once I graduated from school, I left this car behind.  The engine was ridiculously loud, had trouble starting it, the air only worked on full blast, and the exterior paint chips and dents with a strong wind.  If you are looking for a cheap car just to get around in then go for it.  Otherwise spend your money on something more reliable."

I know of a lot of other people whom love their Sunfires, and when I look inside the door, they are made in the USA. So needless to say look around, and look inside the door to see where it is made before you buy yourself a Mexican lemon!  P.S;  they forgot to put in the air conditioner as well!  "

I even had two front-end accidents with the car and never had any major problems with the car before or after the accidents.  The only work I have had done is regular scheduled work, like oil changes, etc.  Even though they don't make Sunfires anymore, its safe to say they would be a good buy if you can find a used one with low mileage.

It hugs curves like no other and is always up for a little bit of free running. It really shines in the country on twisty roads, but it's great for the city too. Awesome fuel economy. I get around for weeks on one tank of gas. I would recommend this car to any parent looking to get their kid a reliable, safe, but fun car in order to get them through college."

needed to be changed.The exterior paint 
was crap.The handling was probably the 
largest downfall expecting tight 
corners and confident 
manuverability.I recieved 
upredictable feed back at high speeds 
and body roll at low.The engine made 
the car quick and fun to drive, but 
handling almost got me in the end.I was 
driving at high speeds around an over 
pass and hit a bumb in the road that, 
sent the unsure rearend out to the side 
of me and I lost control.My passenger

ALOT of highway driving and this car
does have alot of wind noise, especially
when the sunroof is open. I would highly
recommend the 2.2 DOHC engine. I came
from a Cavalier Z24 w/ a v6 engine and
this engine has almost as much power as
that did. Despite the early electrical

fuel efficient car that can be fun to
drive. "

I just traded it in a few weeks ago to buy a SUV.  I had no choice since I’m in my 50’s now and have bad hip and knee problems (needed a vehicle with height - could barely get in and out of the Sunfire on a daily basis anymore).  I really miss it.  Sun and sound package was great - sunroof and better quality AM/FM with CD player.  That car had fantastic pick-up.  It just loved going fast on the highway and I loved the sound of the engine.  It will always be my favorite car!!

Since then the headlights have gone out twice under warranty, then paid +$300 to get them fixed again, now the fog lights are out (issue is in a wiring harness that keeps corroding, and even if they replace the entire harness, the same issue will happen because the harness still is built the same way - with poor wires; GM states that it is not their issue, but if you research this, just about every one of them has this problem; sounds like it should be recalled and a completely new harness designed). The fuel pump will go out about every 50k-60k miles. Now the window will not roll down. Many calls to GM's product assist/complaint line go non-returned."

It didnt. After 1500 miles it started to tear on the front seat  There is lots of plastic on the car.I have replaced 3 wheelcovers because of cracks.  there was a recall for the directional lights. I replaced them 3 times in 6 months, After a rain, If I opened the trunk, water would drip down my back. Door lock problems."

The seat belts locking up(when they shouldn't),left high beem does not work now has a short in it, all my gauges on the dash board don't work, my drivers side window has a short in it and my locks have messed up on it before.

Was fixed for free under warranty. Replaced brakes twice, but they are like $15 each. Seats are uncomfortable and front seat belt strap hits you across the neck. Car handles rough and shocks/struts start to go bad. Doesn't have much power. Car handles HORRIBLE in the rain and windy weather. Slow oil leak started around 60K but not a major issue. Fog lamps stopped working around same time. Driver's side door started catching on frame and wouldn't open. Have to get rid of it now at almost 85K because transmission is bad, but has been reliable up until that point."

We got a great deal on it; $13,000 fully loaded (dual exhaust, power windows, doors, sunroof, spoiler, 6 speaker monsoon sound system).  considering that this is an entry level, commuter car, it has been worth every penny.

In 5 years 1 front strut replaced,Motor for powered windows  and fuel pump ( my fault for running on emtpy).  Other reviews show that the fog lights have gone out and it has to do with the wire harness mine also has the same problem.I have to get rid of it for it is to close to the ground for getting in and out and it is a very rough ride. Not a car for someone with children."

I still get great gas mileage and over 30 mpg on the highways. It's fun to drive and noise is not a factor. The engine is strong and peppy for a 4 cylinder."
pontiac,sunfire,2003,D Hyde, 10/09/2009,Stuff that shouldn't break does,2,"This car is poorly built. The drivetrain so far (50K miles) is fine, but just about everything else has been a disaster. After just a year, both power window motors broke, which cost >$800 to fix. The original brake shoes wore out after only 10K miles, yet the 2nd pair is still fine after 40K. On the roof the clear coat is bubbling and peeling, which started when the car was only 4 years old. The radio sometimes does not turn on when the car does. The whole body is tweaked, so sometimes the doors won't close. Several wheels and the back axle are bent. The suspension is way too soft so the weight distribution is impossible to manage, causing poor handling. Mine doesn't have anti-lock brakes.."
pontiac,sunfire,2003,dabug, 10/18/2009,A lot of car for the money,4,"I bought this car 5 years ago with 32k miles. It now has 90k. I did have to replace the fuel pump at about 50k which is very hard to get to and have changed the brakes once. Other than that no major issues. It has the feel and look of a sports car with the economy of a compact. I am now selling it because I want a truck, but I believe it has a lot of life left in it. Also, reading the other reviews I noticed the ones having the most problems are base models, ones like mine with the dual exhaust and other upgrades tend to be more reliable and a lot nicer cars, however they are harder to find.

pontiac,sunfire,2003,Air Assault SGT, 12/23/2009,Love Pontiac,4,I bought a 2003 sunfire and fell in love with it on the test drive. Since I bought it I have changed things that way I can race it. The only issues that I have had are the o2 sensers and the converter.  I have almost 200k on it and not one drop of leakage. I have lowered it and uped the hp and it runs like a champ and handles better than any other car that I have drove and I run a low 11sec in the quarter mile. I race my car with a stock engine and it has never let me down. This is by far the best 4cylinder that is out there. Better than the Vtec and the Zetech.  Just do your regular maint. on it and it wont let you down. I love my car and it loves me and shows me every race.
pontiac,sunfire,2003,steve b., 04/18/2010,4 door model,2,"Our car is a 2003 4 door model, which i guess was sold only in Canada. It's actually been pretty reliable except for the power windows. I've had to replace the motors in several of the windows,some multiple times, and now this spring they are acting up again.Its about $300 a shot  for the motors.   Two of the interior door panels have popped loose and the digital clock/radio light has died. I'll be getting rid of it soon."

I ended up taking the car off his hands and it has NEVER failed me.
120k mile and I have never ever had one problem with it.

I had to get the left front strut replaced once while it was under warranty but no problems since. 

I replaced both window motors because they both stopped working. But my husband did it himself so it didn't cost very much.

pontiac,sunfire,2003,Patty Aspen, 09/07/2002,A mixed bag,3,"I like the style of the car, as well as 
the fuel efficiency, but I think it is 
very cheaply built compared to other 
cars I've had.  The windshield wipers 
won't go all the way down anymore.  
Screws are coming undone on the 
interior and the plastic that covers 
where the seatbeats attach has broken 
off and looks unsightly.  It's been 
fairly reliable except that the check 
engine light comes on and off randomly."
pontiac,sunfire,2003,speed devil, 09/21/2002,Very Very Mediocare,3," It's braking is soft and very 
unpredictable.  I've almost been in 
serious accidents because the breaks 
did not respond.Handling is just 
okay but traction is good because of 
the widetrac.  The paint is horrible 
and the dirt wont wash off the glued 
on side panels.  All the instruments 
are cheap and the screen for the clock 
and cd player overheats and sometimes 
feels like it will light on fire.  The 
only thing that is really good is the 
stock cd player.   Safety wise 
its a tank, but I dont know how it 
would be in a big accident.  Overall I 
would not recommend the car unless you 
will buy it, rip the system out of it 
and re-sell it."

pontiac,sunfire,2003,bilsfire, 07/24/2012,Great Value car,3,"Car is def. mechanically sound, solid engine and tranny(standard). Interior build quality is less than par, but for the performance factor, you get what you get. The exterior wasnt thought out 100%, the fact that its front wheel drive and comes stock with a rear spoiler, is counterproductive. As long as maintainance is under control, the vehicle will last as long as you last. Oil changes on any smaeller engine aluminum, or otherwise, with higher rev ranges, should be done every 2000-2500 miles as a rule. Performance again is great, the power to weight ratio is above average for the class of car. Plenty of torque for getting going, not too much(spin tires in snow) good horse power."

probably ever get and I truly hope it

wanted an inexpensive car just to run 
around in.  This one might end up 
being my primary car it is so much 
fun.  I have the 1SC package with

pontiac,sunfire,2003,BluByU, 12/20/2003,Big Bang for Little Bucks!,5,"This is my first new car. I have driven 
many other makes and models over the 
years, but the 2003 Sunfire is by far 
the best bang for the buck! It is 
absolutly stunning in it's appearance. 
I have the Blue color and I get at 
least 2 - 4 complements everyday either 
on the color or the look of the car. 
The transmission is so smoth (Auto). I 
live in the mountains of NH, and I can 
do a steady 80 up hill and not even 
feel any hesitation or shifting. The 
only other car I ever drove that was 
faster was a 70's Pontiac Catalina. And 
from the front it looks so tough coming 
at you. I LOVE it and won't ever give 
it up! Pontiac fan for life."

showroom floor-I love the look, I love 
the ride and as fas as being dependable 
well no problems getting to or from 
where I want to go an in comfort too, as 
well as being a blast to drive.  I am 
used to driving old muscle cars with big 
healthy motors mind you.  Heat when I 
need it and icy cold when it is 110

for anything else "
pontiac,sunfire,2003,TOM NIEZNAY, 10/30/2005,2003 PONTIAC SUNFIRE,4,I love to drive my sunfire because it is great on gas and for a 4 cylinder engine it has a lot of power. The sporty appearance is great and it has a roomy trunk. The sound system with cd player is awesome. The automatic transmission shifts really smoothly. Best thing about GM cars is the transmission.
pontiac,sunfire,2003,bizich2484, 01/20/2004,My Review,3,"I've had a love-hate relationship with 
this car. I've only owned it for a 
year and have had to bring it back to 
the dealership 6 times to get various 
parts fixed.  I used to drive a 
Bonneville and I really miss the V6 
that I had in that car.  I do not plan 
on owning this car for much longer, I 
spend a lot of time in my car and I 
need something bigger and has more 
features."

coolest looking car on the market

performance. I feel safer in this car 
than I did in my Dodge Neon (1998 
model). I wish that people would not 
give this car such a hard time. It is a 
great car for a great price. The only 
thing that I may not be happy with 
about this car is that it is hard to 
open the driver's visor without messing 
up the rearview mirror."

I have only had one repair since new the cable for my heating system and seal on my dash where the air comes out for my defrost. I was most impressed with the performance. I like the sunfire due to it has a nice new styling and It fits the sport tuner class.

kind of weird thing to happen. Who

car. It's fun to drive, good 
accleration and alright looking

Sebring! :D I got it with Cavalier LS

handling. Rear end sucks. It looks ugly

would help I guess)"

80 miles a day round trip. With 40,000 
miles in less than two years it has run 
like a top the whole way. No mechanical 
reapirs have been necessary. It is

I think that it is so much cooler looking than the Honda Civics that the rest of the college kids are driving around my home.  The only complaint I have is that there is too much lumbar in the seats and they cannot be adjusted!  When I have to take it from TN to MI my back is killing me by the time we get there.  But, it still does the trip like a charm.  I only have to fill it up twice for the 10 hour drive.  I also wish that it was offered with a V6 engine."
pontiac,sunfire,2003,moodylicious, 04/27/2006,Major Problems,3,"Have had major problems with the brakes suddenly locking up while at hwy speeds while not being able to shift above 3rd gear.  Took five dealer visits before problem was even diagonosed.  Was very disturbed about how serious a problem could not be reproduced in the shop. Once nearly got steamrollered by a semi while trying to regain power.  Problem finally stopped.  Also, power window motors have had been replaced 4 times at $300+ a crack.  Would I buy this car again?  No."

My center console lid has broken, had to replace one window motor, and another soon, vent selectors don't work, the plastic cladding on the outside of the door gets caught on the fender.

No headlights, taillights, brake lights, you name it it broke. Trunk would not latch after a few months after purchase. The plastic interior cracks and falls off. Now the car has internal engine problems. Been broke down for a few weeks and it will cost over a grand to fix one of the problems. I have called GM several times but they say there is nothing they can do. I would not recommend this vehicle to anyone. I never owned a new car until this one.  I will never buy another Pontiac after this experience."
pontiac,sunfire,2003,Tami , 07/31/2007,You Get what you Pay for.,3,"Even though the car looks like a 40,000 dollar sportscar, it is about as good as a used car with a new paint job! I've put more parts on that car in the first 50,000 miles than I put on my first car (used). I replaced two turn signal controls, the fuel pump, the left and the right power window motors, the pasanger seat adjusting handle, the heater temperature control and the seat belt lock. On top of that, you hear every sound outside. It's like riding a bus. Did I forget to mention that the car will slide on spit. If it rains slightly, you should buckle up and say your prayers, that is if the buckle works."
pontiac,sunfire,2003,daveinsc, 10/06/2007,One of the best Cars I have ever owned!,4,"My Sunfire is a beautiful, reliable, fuel effiecient little car. With the spoilers, and front air dam, it looks and drives like a sports car. I am not sure how much horse power 4 cylinder engine puts out, but this is a very fast car for having such a small stock engine. I can cruise at 70 to 80 depending on the speed limit and still get great gas mileage. I can drive 1000 miles on 3 tanks of gas, and still have 1/2 to 3/4 of a tank left.  If I were asked to recommend this car I would definitly say buy it! I am buying a new pickup, but I am keeping the Sunfire. It is a very reliable car, and I expect to get at least another 100,000 miles out of it or more. It has 34,000 now and no problems"

I just had to spend $500 to get the brakes fixed and I only have 44,000 miles on the car! The cylinders were cracked and brake fluid was leaking and the brake pads and shoes had to be replaced. Now, my window doesn't work and it will be another $400 to replace the motor. After reading other's comments, the windows are a problem with this car. Beware that your brakes may be a problem too, even if your mileage is less than 50,000. I will never buy a Pontiac again and hope I can hold off having anymore major problems with this car for another year or so. "
pontiac,sunfire,2003,Heather, 10/16/2007,Okay for economic reasons,3,I bought this car in 2003 when I as a single mother who needed a new car.  It was not the best decision I have ever made. The car is very uncomfortable and loud on the road. The gas mileage is great but I will not buy another one. There are better economic choices.

I called to register it they told me I 
was the first person ever to call with

Only problems Ive had so far are a 
rattling in the car that the pontiac 
place can't figure out what it is.  A 
slight defect on the left turn single 
lens and its now been 2 months since 
they ordered a peice to fix it.   Also 
there was a rip in the back seat, I've

We are all familiar with the Pontiac 
Sunfire, because it's been with us for 
years, but there is great news for 
2003 model year ! 
It has the new 2.2 Ecotec engine which 
is a absolute gem of smoothness and 
great power. Four-speed automatic 
mates with it fantastically ! 
Interrior has been changed, and it is 
not all bad either, that powerful 
Monsoon stereo-system will part your 
hair if needed..thank's GM ! Styling 
could be slighly toned down, but this 
is a Pontiac after all !     Juhani.

pontiac,sunfire,2003,Bell23, 05/24/2003,On fire,4,"We fell in love with three things the 
new model had.  Once is the same dual 
overhead cam Ecotek engine that gives 
more than 30mpg every tank, even if you 
drive as if it is a Cendar Point ride 
on wheels.  The second was the new, 2-
years ago, 4-speed automatic.  We 
learned you could pull it behind a 
motor home, it had enhanced traction 
control for winter fun, and the 
overdrive gear ratio of .66 matched the 
5-speed manual for that gas mileage 
edge.  

The last thing is the new look.  GM 
stopped making the 4-door Sunfire and 
upgraded the look dramatically.  The 
front has the swooping headlights and 
the aggressive Trans-am look.  "

for a 2003 one.  WOW: I've fallen in 
love all over again.  I was little sad 
as I pulled out of the dealership 
leaving my green sunfire behind, but I 
quickly forgot about it when I felt the 
power behind the 2003 model.  It rides 
great and after having absolutely no 
problems with my first Sunfire, how 
could I pass up the latest model?  It's 
a fun car to drive and I look forward 
to 5 more years of driving excitement!"

2.2L Ecotec.  The Sunfire is quiet at 
idle and quick with only a slight 
rumble from the dual exhaust during 
acceleration.  If you are in the 
market for a Cavalier or Ion from GM, 
I would definitely also check out the 
Sunfire.  Also if you are looking at a 
Civic Coupe, I would STRONGLY 
recommend a visit to test-drive the 
faster, more stylish and better 
equipped Sunfire!"
pontiac,sunfire,2003,cruella, 07/09/2003,can't beat this price,4,"This car was bought for a sixteen year

I only had it a few months and the engine light started coming on . I spent thousands of dollars on "" repairs "" to get it out for the emission test. This car is nothing but aggravation .

It only has 2900 miles on it and I have had to get the breaks replaced twice now. Both times the life time warranty pads have been replaced and the the rotors as well as some other things. There was a recall after a couple years as the check engine light will come on , but they fixed that. I have had to replace the tire a few times now , the front tires wear on this car very quickly as well as the breaks. Also the windshield wipers fluid doesn't last at all. Other than that I haven't had any problems. Although that seems like a lot considering the mileage .It has good handling and looks."
pontiac,sunfire,2004,Jonny, 07/12/2009,Last Model Sunfire Out with a Bang,4,"The 2004 Pontiac Sunfire was definitely one for the books.  With lots of economical problems with the car's history (the older 1990's models and early 2000 models) I expected some high maintenance work.  However, I was disappointed at that end.  The car's economical ability is standard.  Change bulbs when burnt out, fill gas, change oil.  The performance is also outstanding considering the heavy body style.  With a 2.2L Ecotec engine backed by a 4 speed Automatic Transmission (I also drove a 5 speed manual) you will get the power you need to steer through tight corners while still being able to utilize the agility of the power-to-weight ratio.  All in all, a fun car to drive."
pontiac,sunfire,2004,jk, 09/06/2009,5 years and counting...,3,"Purchased new in 2004, it now has almost 100,000kms. Anybody expecting luxury and the finest build quality in a Sunfire is barking up the wrong tree. Its an economy car that gets you from A to B. Gas mileage is great in the city/highway, reliability has been good.  Biggest issue was having to replace the struts within 1 year of ownership. No problems with transmission or engine. Although the 4 cyl is a peppy engine, its not refined and is harsh above 4,000RPM. Passing power is good with the automatic, hitting it at 70km/h seems to be its sweet spot.  Overall a good, practical and fuel efficient car.    "
pontiac,sunfire,2004,holly4troy, 12/15/2011,Best car I've ever owed!,4,"I am in search of another car due to a collision with a deer and am so disappointed because I loved both my Sunfires I have owed. My first was a 2004 yellow Sunfire and most recently at 2005 orange Sunfire. They both were always reliable, never had any problems with either one except for the CD player in my most recent. Never could get it to work properly without it wanted to eat a CD. Other than that, I LOVED both cars and wish I could find another!

** I had to select a model but both were automatic and not 5 speed but automatic was not an option to choose."
pontiac,sunfire,2004,67carjunkie, 09/05/2011,Want it back,4,I loved my car until I got hit on the back right side. Edmunds said that it has poor side crash test mine survived the crash much better then the 08 civic. Was not the fastest car but it was decent just couldn't get me out of the crash. Edmunds also said not that fast but I beat a brand new mazda 6 with a 04 sunfire that had 4 cylinders.

I love my Sunfire!,5,"Bought a 2004 Sunfire as I needed a good used car with low mileage which it had 64,800 and now has almost 111,600 miles after 4years. I love driving this sporty-looking small car. Handles nice, driving at highway speeds feels like I am floating on air. Has built-in satellite antenna so I was happy to have satellite radio included. Power sunroof and Windows down during the summer kept the A/C off which works fine.  For the price I paid on this car, I am very happy buying and driving a Pontiac which is an American icon and Made in America vehicle. You do not see many of these cars around any longer and I am happy to own mine. Great car!

pontiac,sunfire,2004,Donna, 07/11/2019,15 yrs old and still going!,4,"The biggest thing I can say about this car is that it has never left me stranded.  It's 15 yrs old now, 164,000 miles, and she still starts every time I turn the key. Even when she has booboos she keeps going to make sure I get where I need to and home. The only time this car didn't roll, she was parked in front of my house  (162,000 miles the shift cable bushing melted off the transmission lever, summer in NC). Vent solenoid cracked at 160k miles, came out in 2 pieces but the car kept driving. Keeping in mind these cars aren't made anymore, don't expect top of the line technology. It's functional, but there's no USB ports. Not a bad car.  Great for a younger guy's first vehicle if he's looking for something sporty to get his feet wet and play with.

Runs like a new one. The only things I have had to replace is the cluster panel, the window motor & regulator and the switch module. Just had to do that recently. As for as the engine nothing, just the regular maintenance. My goal is to get 200,000 miles on it and I should be able to without a problem.

pontiac,sunfire,2004,ahnalia, 01/28/2014,I'm having doubts,3,"I have read a lot of good reviews about this car. I found one for sale with very low mileage, only 70k miles. Within 2 days of buying it, the ICP went out, so I had to replace that for $230.00.
 
Not even a week later there was a loud knocking noice when I turned on the defroster, so now that will need replaced too. 

I know when you buy a used car, you take a risk, but I have -never- had a car start having problems within TWO days of buying it.

It seems to drive OK, but I am having a lot of doubts about tyhe electrical system.

It does handle good on ice, but doesn't have a lot of ""Get up and go"" it feels sort of laggy.
It is a pretty car though, but still, I'm not impressed."
pontiac,sunfire,2004,ed, 01/13/2009,Sunfire great but flaws,3,This is my first car. Runs great can't complain. I had an accident with it. Another person hit me. On the left hand panel. It was like a tank. Nothing broken but the exterior. Lately I was going down the highway and the speedometer went crazy. It looked like I was traveling at 110 mph. I hit the brakes and pulled onto the shoulder. I found out it wasn't the speed sensor but more like the panel cluster which is a huge problem in these cars. It has been causing lots of problems and is now a money pit. With no problems it is very fast and reliable but when it goes get rid of it immediatly. 
pontiac,sunfire,2004,kotoja, 02/22/2009,Good quality,4,Well is a good car. I enjoy driving my car. Is not bad as people are saying. It has nice handling. It responds nice on the street. Is also pretty fast

I was sold after just two blocks of the test drive and a year later, I have nothing but great things to say about this car. My only expenditures have been gas and a couple oil changes. You turn the key and the car starts and is the most reliable vehicle I've ever driven. I recommend this care Sunfire to anyone who wants a reliable, economical vehicle that's fun to drive.

Good fuel economy, fast pick up, sleek body.  In 4 years I've replaced 2 tires, the front wheel bearings and I should replace the gas cap.  If I can, when it's time to replace this one I'd like one just like it. I've put 48,000 kms on it in 4 years and I am happy with it's performance and reliability. I can't imagine driving anything other than a Pontiac. I guess I've been lucky that my three cars have been stout workhorses.

pontiac,sunfire,2004,BG, 02/28/2006,Great Car,3,"I was a little skeptical about this entry level car but so far it has made a believer out of me! It is a real eye catcher and its low ride and sporty looks reminds me of the good old american cars from the 70s. Its starts every time up here in Canada and gets pretty good gas mileage even in real cold weather. Our other car is a 2004 Civic and to date the Sunfire has had less problems than the Honda, go figure!"

The ride is excellent. You can not

Traveling back and forth to college everyday, the car is very reliable. It goes great in the snow and even has a decent stereo system that sounds great with the windows down and the sunroof open. The only problem is that I had to put tires on a little over a year after the dealer put new ones on in the trade in. Occassionally has a rough start up in cold weather but overall the car was a great choice for my first car. My car also features a factory installed stripe package covering both doors that captures the attention of people along with the bright yellow color. "
pontiac,sunfire,2004,Jon, 05/16/2007,Sunfire The best,4,"I have had this Car since the begining of September of '04. I drive a lot and put on astronmocial amounts of mileage on my cars. I have had foreign cars and find they are are more trouble than they are worth. I had a Honda Accord and didn't like them so I went to American after that car. Having over 70,000 miles on this car it was never in the shop for warrenty work always regular maintence. Although seats aren't the best it gives me enough room for driving every day and the cruise control is awsome. This car has a nice in your face front and clean look in the back."
pontiac,sunfire,2004,L33y4, 05/28/2008,My first car!,4,"I recently bought this car used with only 50,000 km on it. It was extremely cheap, and that's why I got it. Its my first manual transmission, and it's so fun to drive! Nothing has gone wrong yet, and hopefully won't for a while! Though the 2 middle air vents don't work. I didn't realize it until after I got the car. I'm sure its fixable though. Before this I drove a cheap little Korean car, and compared to that thing, the Sunfire looks and feels like a $40,000 car! I will never drive foreign again! American cars have more fun features to offer with better quality too! Besides the body lasts forever on American."

The airbags did deploy, and no one was seriously hurt, but the car itself, I am beyond words of how utterly destroyed the car is. Total loss, engine is nearly inside the dashboard, window shattered, hood is almost up to the windshield. Flimsy design and completely unsafe IMO. If you own one of these, sell it NOW! You may be saving a life! I will NEVER buy another GM car-ever!"
pontiac,sunfire,2004,Jon Leibowitz, 05/21/2004,Not Worth It!,1,"Consider the Sunfire and similar 
Chevrolet Cavalier basic transportation 
only--both are crude, unpleasant, and 
outdated. The Sunfire sedan has been 
discontinued, and the coupe received a 
face lift for 2003. The Sunfire's only 
virtue is its secure handling. ABS is 
no longer standard. The ride is stiff, 
uncomfortable, and lacking in control. 
The four-cylinder engine is buzzy. The 
thinly padded front seats lack support 
and are fatiguing on long journeys. The 
rear seat is badly shaped and cramped, 
and accessing it takes athletic skill. 
Interior fit and finish are subpar. 
Poor side-crash-test results are 
another minus. I'm gonna get a nice new 
Celica."

realize that it is the cheapest piece 
of pure garbage on the road today.
 Along with all of the interior 
components ratteling, such as the 
dashboard, door panels, and headliner. 
The mechanical components were also 
assembled very poorly, such as the 
trunk locking mechanism, which has bent

buzzing door panels that hold the 
speakers.

I have not been happy with this vehicle from the start and wanted to return it, but they would not.  Once a lemon always a lemon, now I have 54,000 km on it and one of the bearing is totally disintegrated.  Now Gm is wondering why, purpose because it was a lemon from the beginning. I am not carless, they do not give courtesy cars to powertrain warranty customers and they seem to be taking there sweet time.  I put in several complaints about this car in the past and got no where.  I'm sure they just thought I was a complainer. HATE this car,never will buy again"

pontiac,sunfire,2004,LGrant, 05/02/2005,Sunfires are Bad Cars,2,We have had nothing but trouble with this car since we bought it.  The latest is that the motor mount broke in half which messed up the axles.  The car is an accident waiting to happen.  I am just lucky my daughter didnt get hurt.  The hood is still loose on one side but the dealers will not replace it.  We have been in three times.  When the trunk started leaking (two days after we got the car)they found a wire coat hanger inside the wall but could not explain it.  The car is a pile of junk.  It is defective but Pontiac will not do anything about it. I guess they are waiting for someone to die first.

This car was not on my radar as I looked at Civic's, Scion's and others....    So far I am very pleased with the engine, it takes the mountains with ease and the mileage is very good.   The seats are horrible. fit and finish is fair... Room inside is poor.  Handling is very good and is fun to drive.   Styling still sets it apart.   Resale is horrible...

I ended up just buying a new one.  After having the new Sunfire for over a year, I enjoy this one more than my old one.  I wasn't happy with the newer styling, but it has grown on me.  I drive the car about 100 miles a day, and I have not had any problems with it, except for having to replace two of the tires already and the windshield(I'm not good with windshields, I had to replace the windshield four times in my old Sunfire).

pontiac,sunfire,2004,fieroguy, 05/25/2004,its junk,1,"first, the engine, it makes a lot of 
noise and not much power, if there are 
more then two people in the car, you 
have to shift down allot.  The fuel 
milage is terrible, about 450 to 500KM 
to a tank.  The suspension is 
terrible, the car leans on all 
corners, and this combination of power 
and suspension gives you an uneasy 
feeling driving over 70KM and passing 
at any speed.  Build quality is 
terrible.  The brakes give an uneasy 
feeling, if they lock the car pulls to 
the left.  Inside the car, there is a 
lot of noise, the sand and gravel on 
the road in winter sounds like you are 
driving on a gravel road and can get 
annoying.  This is not a winter car"

Jag/2003, Honda Civic EX 2002/ Transam 
2000/ Suburban 1999 and  of course a 
2004 Sunfire.  I believe Hondas and 
Toyota are overrated for the cost it 
takes to own them. Between the honda 
and sufire/ sunfire for price quality.  
I has options like traction control/ 
side air bags that the Honda Civic 
doesn't even offer.  The seats are 
softer than Mercedes or Jaguar.  It is 
cheap on the interior, but everything 
you need is there. A $18,000 Sunfire 
with $4000 rebate and $3500 GM bucks 
ends up costing $9677 with taxes and 
tags.  Try that with a Honda!

bumper warrenty that they say that 
comes with every car.it only had 5,000
miles on it.they tried to sell her a 
new tire....for only 250 dollars...so 
she went to wal mart for a 60 dollar
tire....pretty sad that a 20,000 car
i paid for,they wouldn,t honor the so 
called warrenty.....be careful for the 
fine print....rather had all 4 tires 
the same than 3 of one and 1 of a 
different brand but gm didn,t offer me
no options.....hint...hint....gm"

pontiac,sunfire,2004,Slats, 10/18/2004,Best Bang for the Buck,4,"I am now purchasing my 3rd Sunfire GT.  
This is a testiment to the uncanny 
reliability I have experienced over the 
years with these inexpensive cars and 
large number of features for the buck. 
Simply put, no car for the dollar 
offers what Sunfire does.  I owned a 97 
GT, 01 GT and now just purchased an 05 
GT. Besides regular maintenance (Oil, 
brakes and odd recall for software 
updates), I have had operational 
failure in these cars. I owned a 95 
Honda Prelude that almost bankrupt me 
in repair bills, then I took a chance 
on the Sunfire and still can't find a 
reason leave.   Sorry Corolla, Civic 
and Focus; You're too expensive and 
lack Zest! "
pontiac,sunfire,2004,Lee Mack, 10/28/2004,"Sunfire made in Mexico no kidding,crap c",3,"  I have had nothing but problems with 
my Sunfire.  First the radiator, then 
the transmission, then the starter, 
electronics in the dash, trunk will no 
longer open, then the radiator again, 
then the slave cylinder,and now it 
starts and idals funny.  I'am not 
impressed at all with this car, it is a 
total lemon and I'am not the only 
person that has had problems with their 
car as well, alot of other people have 
had problems as well."

pontiac,sunfire,2004,Maximillian, 01/11/2006,Bang for the buck,5,"Six months ago I purchased my 2004 used Sunfire. It had 26,000 miles on the odometer. No regrets. Great car. Extremely reliable. I would recommend it to everybody. Very cheap to buy if buying used. Bang for the buck when compared with other cars in its class. Extremely economical. The front cateye looks goes great with the car.  Ive heard a lot of bad things regarding the pre-2003 models. I guarantee the past 2003 are completely different.  I can only conclude that people who experience problems with 2003, 2004, and 2005 models are cars that have been in an accident and that have been not been properly repaired. If you buy it and it hasnt been in an accident you wont go wrong."
pontiac,sunfire,2004,Arunangshu Hor, 01/11/2006,Great Car,4,"A very good car for the money. I believe Hondas and Toyota are overrated for the cost it takes to own them. Between the honda and sufire, I would suggest Sunfire for price  & quality.It has everything basic you need in a car."
pontiac,sunfire,2004,JulieBear, 11/15/2006,Best car I ever owned,4,"I bought this car last Nov. I absolutely love it. I am a die hard foreign car buyer but when I had to replace my car on short notice I decided to by my red sunfire. I am still in love with this car. The car pickups quickly and I have had only one mechanical problem (an O2 sensor which my warranty took care of) with 46,000 and going. The car handles decently and is surprisingly nimble in the Massachusetts snow. My only complaint which I have heard a lot is the cup holders are in front of the heat controls so they are hard to get to if you have a cup in them. All in all I couldn't be happier with my purchase!!"
pontiac,sunfire,2004,MLD, 03/14/2007,04 Sunfire,3,I have had this car for 3 years it is a good car i have had a few problems with it for the motor mount crushing to the sunroof leaking to now the ac/heat works when it wants to and it sometimes hard to start the cd player has been replace do to it stop working but other then that i have enjoy driving my car when it not getting worked on it has a great take off very fast for a 2.2 
pontiac,sunfire,2005,davyd, 09/04/2011,"Good Car, Some Faults",4,"I got an '05 Sunfire with roughly 117000 miles on it, it's still going strong! Except the gauges... I'm not sure if it has something to do with the heat, but everything works at night and in the mornings. But everyday after school, after my car has been sitting in the sun for 8 hours, the gauges like to ""stick"". I don't know if this is happenign to everyone or just me. I think it's a very nice first car, it's got a nice accelation, and gass isn't too terrible on it. But my only problem with it is the Gauges. I'm not sure if it's electrical and can be fixed manually, but if anyone knows anything, please tell me."
pontiac,sunfire,2005,Nancy, 01/29/2006,Affordable & Classie,5,It is great for long distance driving as well as in town driving. Very comfortable front and back seating. The SunFire handles very well under all driving weather conditions. Fuel economy is great!  
pontiac,sunfire,2005,chesterr, 11/29/2008,05 Sunfire,4,It has been  good solid car at a low price. Only problem I had is wiring was not installed right at factory. Engine doesn't burn oil after 73 k. Should go 200k easy. I use synthetic at least once a year

pontiac,sunfire,2005,ddeaves, 08/01/2011,6 yrs and going strong,4,"I bought my little sunfire new in 2005. I got the sport package with the snazzy wheels and side designs. I have had more complements on this Electric Blue car, than my red mustang! It just looks FAST and sporty. I'm not even a big fan of blue, but people love it. I have never had to do a thing to it, just reg. oil changes, runs great. I only have 35,000 miles on it, but I'm pretty rough on a car, and it has done well, and is still BEAUTIFUL. I have the 5 speed manuel, gets good gas mileage, about 33 hwy, 25 in town. My kids all say it is a really rough passenger ride, but as the driver, I don't notice it. It has a lot of get up and go (torque). "
pontiac,sunfire,2005,ladevic, 09/12/2010,05 Pontiac Sunfire,4,"I bought my sunfire with 5,000 miles on it. It had done well besides some issues.. The first was the dash, had to replace that after two weeks since the gauges all fell.. now my problem is the electrical, things keep shorting out.. other than that the car is great. Drive to NY twice a year 700 miles each way, to Fla each year and to work each day. Knock on wood, it hasn't failed me yet. Great at high speeds, low speeds and gas mileage is the best. Oil changes every 5-7000 miles.. "
pontiac,sunfire,2005,adc1990, 06/24/2008,It's not just a car it's a Sunfire,3,"I just purchased this 2004 Pontiac Sunfire its a bronze color but it looks more like a brown/ silver color. This car can get to high speeds quickly for a affordable car. Hear the engine roar with the Sunfire. So far its been nothing but good to me its always reliable. Everything on the car is impeccable, it works to the ""t"" and Pontiac didn't miss a beat. The design is alright nice bulky interior, seats are fairly comfortable. This car makes you feel good when you drive it, it rides nice and smooth and everything about the car is awesome. I would say the one downfall is the stereo. Its not the best my speakers sound like crap so I'm replacing them and the stereo and putting my 12"" in the back."
pontiac,sunfire,2005,Kemper Lockout Serv , 07/01/2004,Fast and furious.,4,"This car is a very sporty and fast 
compact vehicle. I find it to have  
more room then the honda civic. When i 
purchased my pontiac sunfire i found it 
to be very quick as well as fun to 
drive. And the gas milage is excellent."
pontiac,sunfire,2005,John, 01/04/2010,every thing keeps breaking,3,"The car broke the third day we owned it. the fuel injecter went out then it was the coil pack, that went out. the the transmission is slipping and instrament pannel has allmost gone complety out."
pontiac,sunfire,2005,chyil, 09/07/2010,Love this car but frustrated,4,I would buy another Sunfire in a heartbeat. My frustration right now is finding the parts I need to keep my 2005 running so I can keep it a while. I have been looking on line and cannot get a clear name and purchase price for the parts I need. If anyone can help me I would appreciate it. I want purchase the parts so my fiance can put them on. I need a hanger/bracket  for my muffler it is swaying and squeaking. I need a trunk latch and or cable. I have not been able to use it for 2 years either sticks close or pops open while driving. I need a washer fluid reservoir mine has a hole in it. And I do not know what I need for a tachometer  sticks when over 100 degrees.
pontiac,sunfire,2005,banaMwape, 10/19/2010,Loved my Sunfire,5,"It's been almost a year since I lost my Sunfire, but I loved it! Tires were the only regular problem I had. But after four years, the battery only stalled on me once, and the window motor started shorting. But those were minor problems compared to the fact that I was able to move efficiently.  I took many 14 hour road trips in my little sunfire. Comfort was a bit short on those trips, but gas mileage could not match to most other cars.  $60 could get me from Tucson to Dallas easy.  I loved the sunroof. Rarely used the MP3 player. Loved the sound. Loved the mobility. Loved the style. It was my first car so maybe I'm a bit bias here, but still! Pontiac Sunfire = Amazing First Car!"
pontiac,sunfire,2005,Lance, 02/23/2006,GREAT car to get back and forth to work!,4,"Traded in my base model Ford Focus, loved the standard features.  Couldn't beat the price.  Very pleased with gas mileage and handling."
pontiac,sunfire,2005,HET, 10/22/2004,Great Car and Bargain,4,"I purchased this car for my wife and 
she loves it. It'a a big improvement 
over the Suburban we traded it for. 
Now she can pull in and out of parking 
spaces with ease, whip in and out of 
traffic, and not worry about using gas 
to go to the grocery store. We didn't 
get the power package or On-star; the 
dealership didn't have any on the lot. 
But that's OK. She's the only one 
driving it and her other car is a 
Cadillac CTS. Eventually, it will be a 
great get around car one day for our 
soon to be teenager."
pontiac,sunfire,2005,james elliott, 02/18/2005,My svm 05 sunfire,5, I am 75 years old and have owned over 50 new cars so I usually dont get too excited when I get a new one. This one did it. The performance is great. The shifter is excelent. Good gas mileage. Good price. A fun to drive green machine.
pontiac,sunfire,2005,swimtime7, 08/17/2011,Happy so far!,4,"We just purchased my first car... 2005 Pontiac Sunfire base with air conditioning being the only option, no power windows, no power locks. It was 4000 with 86,100 miles on it. Obviously, since it's my first car I love it, but seriously this is a fun car to drive, and the 5 speed stick shift just adds to the fun! This is the best year reliability wise for the Sunfire, and in my opinion I think this was the best design of the Sunfire series. I do wish i at least had a cassette or cd player, but until i come up with the $$ for a new head unit, my Belkin Auto FM Transmitter will do just fine. So far so good!"
pontiac,sunfire,2005,teri , 04/26/2008,Love my sunfire,4,"I have had my Sunfire for 2 years and drive 50 miles ( all highway) to work and 50 miles home 6 days a week, and I love my car. I too don't think these cars got the reviews they deserved. I love the fold down seats in the back... so much more room ! The gas mileage is great ! the only suggestion I would have is the placement of the cup holders but other than thats it's a great little car. I have put 40k miles on it in two years and it still runs like a charm !"
pontiac,sunfire,2005,L. C, 01/03/2017,Peppy little car!,5,"Great little car for work school and town. Easy to get in small places. Great turn radius and plenty of pep on acceleration. Very reliable car .Love the gas mileage! Saves you loads in money on gas!

pontiac,sunfire,2005,Ozzie, 11/12/2008,Very Good Car,3,I bought a 2005 Sunfire with 28k miles on it and after one year and 16k later my Sunfire is getting better despite considering that I bough it with a salvage title (the car was in an accident). I put $15 on gas and my Sunfuire is taking me to work all week and my job is 18 miles from home. 
pontiac,sunfire,2005,Amy, 01/25/2006,Vents,2,"Owned my car for one month, the vents do not properly work in the center of the dash, there was a problem with my door not closing and the car not starting properly, I'm told that my vents cannot be fixed due to the way the car was designed, so basically the car was designed for 3 out of 4 vents to get air-flow! Way to go Pontaic, ha."
pontiac,sunfire,2005,Matt, 01/18/2006,Good car for a first time buyer,4,I've had my sunfire for about six months now and have enjoyed it. I used to have an Alero and I like this much better. The burnt orange color gets comments all the time and tinting the windows adds to a sweet look. The fuel economy is amazing; I've gone about two weeks without fueling up! And that's with a car starter that I let run for a few minutes before I leave!
pontiac,sunfire,2005,Sheri, 04/02/2005,Great All Around Vehicle,4,"I've had My PS going on 2 yrs this Sept. and just recently had any type of ""Major Repair"" (front brakes) otherwise very reliable vehicle and would definitely consider purchasing another within the next year or two."
pontiac,sunfire,2005,Monopoly, 12/16/2009,"Sturdy, Cheap, A to B vehicle.",3,"Bought new and currently have 161000kms. Car rattles like crazy and is really starting to show its age. in 05' it was the most powerful, affordable eco-car in its class. My base model manual trans black 2dr with decent tires is peppy in a straight line but handles horribly. The seats are unbearingly uncomfortable for long trips. Good things about it is they are super cheap for everything incl. parts and insurance. fuel econ is decent. I avg 600kms a 53L tank mixed driving. I noticed these cars are approx $4000 for one in OK condition. pick one up if your on a budget. itl make a great short commuter and has a reliable drive train. watch for everything else. GM's tend to fall apart at 120kms"
pontiac,sunfire,2005,AG, 09/14/2008,I'm through with this car,2,"I had an 04 but totaled it - bought an 05 and have had slew of problems. Bad brake rotors to the point of where they snapped while I was driving leaving me stranded. The engine stalls, the cd/mp3 player frequently shorts resetting my clock, the model itself affects my tires in which I've replaced 6 in the past 21/2 years that I purchased this car. The window motor shorts leaving one of my Windows down in Atlanta during winter. Power steering flawed, trunk shorted out and wouldn't close for about three months. My gauges cross over each other in some malfunction preventing me from checking my speed/rpms. Fuel gauge backlight does not fully turn on. Everything on this car sucks! "
pontiac,sunfire,2005,Max, 01/13/2009,Very good and fun car,4,"This is my 3rd Sunbird/Sunfire, 1st bought new. Very satisfied! 25-28mpg. No mechanical problems at all at 27k miles. Only issue was with bodywork as trunklid twice would not close. Dealer fixed promptly. VG performance from 2.2L engine. Styling still attractive after 4 yrs, beats the G5 handsdown. Dropdown rear seatbacks have allowed me to carry much more than you may think! And yep, cupholders location stink! Kept car simple with base model, no power windows or locks so no problem there. Very good sound system. Normal maintenance. Oil and filters every 3000 miles. Original tires about halfway to replacement"
pontiac,sunfire,2005,hami5150, 03/15/2009,Great car for the money,4,"I got this one brand new, and the only major problem I have had was a flat tire. The car runs very smooth, and handles well, although the windshield frame proves to be a slight blind spot at times, and the design of the interior make it difficult to see into lanes to the right/rear. Engine-wise, not a problem yet. Friend of mine has an Elantra, and paid at least 5k more, and I would still rather have the Sunfire. Mine is a manual trans, and even though i only get 140hp, it still kicks a little when i need it"

pontiac,sunfire,2005,Moe, 03/26/2005,Good car...Great price,4,"My wife loves this car...she says she feels at home in it. I am 6'4"" and I even fit with some comfort. These days with gas prices this car is a perfect fit with our budget(by the way...Edmunds say this car's actual value is around $11,000..we paid $8600 including tax) Good car....Great price!"
pontiac,sunfire,2005,Andrew Olexson, 04/17/2005,Sports car - great price!,5,"In 3 weeks driven 1600 miles, fuel savings have made car payment, 30 mpg.  Sunfire acceleration and handling are great."
pontiac,sunfire,2005,Ian, 07/08/2005,Powerful and Inexpensive,4,"Reasonable handling on sharp curves, easy to steer during steady speeds however more effort is needed for steering during low speeds via coming in and out of a parking space. The ECOTEC is very powerful and is extremely quiet during idle and midrange speeds, however hard acceleration causes the engine to howl but not annoying. The automatic transmission handles well it revs/shifts quickly, the transmission itself is easy to quick shift via making a swift K-turn, it makes little to no mistakes when finding its gear when going uphill, however going uphill is a battle within it self. Overall it is worth the price. GM/Pontiac has done a superb job on the tuner like engine."
pontiac,sunfire,2005,greg ihrke, 07/09/2005,the hot one,5,"This is one hot ride. From day one it has been outstanding performance. Don't buy an automatic transmission get a 5 speed.  Why 37 miles to the gallon, it shifts smooth and has cruise control. It comes with everything I need."
pontiac,sunfire,2005,Tracy, 08/12/2005,Total Satisfaction,5,"Although I have only owned this vehicle for a month, It is well worth the money.  This car is fun to drive, stylish, and gets really good gas mileage.  Right now I am getting 38 miles a gallon.  Although this vehicle has a 4 cyl. engine, it drives like a 6 cyl.  I enjoy this vehicle very much.  "

pontiac,sunfire,2005,Darlene, 09/14/2005,I love this car!,5,"I just got out of an Alero (Otherwise known as GM Garbage.) And the sunfire is great.!  Looks good, drives fantastic, great mileage and still sporty.  so far the only thing that has had to be repaired, is one of the doorpanels were not one securely and that took about 5 miutes to have reattached,."
pontiac,sunfire,2005,DD, 09/27/2005,Yellow Sunfire,4,"Needed an economical car for a daily commute of 160 miles.  This one has exceeded my expectaions on all fronts.  Initial price was great, economy (33- 36 mpg)is great, it is a zippy passer on two lane roads, and the yellow coupe draws more attention than the vet I owned years ago."
pontiac,sunfire,2005,Bill, 10/30/2005,Great Little Car,3,I have had this car for about 7 months now and it is the most fun car I have ever owned.  It is bright red and handles like a dream.  Strangers approach me often asking me questions or complimenting it.

After I cashed in GM card earnings, I only paid $5800 for it, so I can't really complain about anything. However, I do think the seats are worth mentioning. Even in such an inexpensive car, the fabric is unbelievably cheap. 1200 miles and the drivers seat is showing considerable wear. I have to get some seat covers soon. Aside from that, however, I love it."
pontiac,sunfire,2005,Jason, 03/24/2005,My Fire Review,4,Its a nice smooth shifting 5 speed.  It does have some get up and go and many after market parts for the tuner world.

So, I now have another blue Sunfire - stick shift like my old one --- and I wouldn't change a thing!!! I love it!

My biggest problem with the car is a stalling issue, which has not been resolved in three trips back to the dealer. As it is intermittent, it never does it when the mechanics have it:  however it is a constant problem for me.  If this could be resolved, I would be happy with the car...however at this point I am considering trading it in on a make that has a more reliable rating, i.e. Toyota or Honda."
pontiac,sunfire,2005,red/line, 04/11/2007,My first car,4,"When the salesman pulled the white 2005 Sunfire up, at first I was upset. He told me take it for a spin, and when you come back, tell me what you thought. Lucky for me the dealership was right next to the freeway. I got the car up to 55, and floored it. All it took was the time to downshift, and hit the powerband(instantly), and I was doing 70, going into 3rd gear which never ends. I love the performance of this car. The styling is cool as well, it stands out from the crowd. The interior is cool, but kinda cramped, but im just over 6'2"" so it would be. "
pontiac,sunfire,2005,Paul, 04/10/2007,Two for two,4,"After 4 problem-free years of driving a 1998 Sunfire ( bought used ), I purchased a 2005 4-door sedan in early 2005. Again, I've enjoyed problem-free driving for the past two years. I noted several subtle improvements over my '98 model. Like many domestic products, I believe that the Sunfire has received an unfair rating from the so-called experts, who seem to be fixated on the supposed superiority of certain pet imports. The consistently very high ratings of Sunfire owners speak for themselves!"
pontiac,sunfire,2005,Amanda, 07/27/2007,Great car,5,"This is the 4th Sunfire I have owned. I have loved everything about this car. Due to a recent accident I no longer have this vehicle, which is why I am writting.  My husband and I hit a telephone pole at approx 50 mph and even though the car suffered major damage we both walked away with only a small bruise. I am very happy with the way the interior of this car stood up.  A lot of times you see cars that completely fall part this car is amazing!  I just wish they still made them so I could have another new one."
pontiac,sunfire,2005,MaxwellSE, 09/05/2007,"Not so bad, but could be better",3,"Owned the Sunfire for two years, really good gas mileage and engine power for the price. The interior has a nice layout but some components were cheap. I have had a few problems including the brake rotors wearing out every six months and the wiring has a short, which causes the CD player to reset and the enigine has trouble starting sometimes."
pontiac,sunfire,2005,I Love It!, 06/10/2007,I Love It!,4,I own an '05 white Sunfire and this was my first car. I couldn't ask for anything better. I absolutely love it. I handles beautifully and I'm in love with the exterior. This is an excellent car for the money and I am proud to own it.
pontiac,sunfire,2005,Carla, 11/16/2007,Can't Wait To Get Rid Of This Car,3,"I've had major problems with this car:   ""Theft deterrent system"" went down, making the car think I was trying to steal it, and stranded me on a cold December night.  Ignition coil and spark plug crapped out, leaving me stranded again, as the car was basically running on just two cylinders. It's going into the shop tonight for replacement of the catalytic converter, which is plugging up. Driver's side keyless entry doesn't work. Well, the electronics work, but the lock won't unengage.  I have to open it with the key, and it turns really hard; will probably break off in the lock someday.  In short ... I despise this car.  Thank heaven it's still under warranty."
pontiac,sunfire,2005,Alright, 03/26/2008,Alright,4,"I like the Pontiac Sunfire, but my car has a stalling problem. Since I've had this car, I've had to already put in several hundred dollars into it, for Muffler, A-Arm on Front passenger side wheel, and still trying to figure out why it dies on me in the middle of driving. Other than that, I like the car. It gets really great gas mileage! 295 miles to a tank. I averaged about 28 miles a gallon. Its comfortable and has some get up and go. If you punch the gas, make sure your car shifts (I have an automatic) but it still tends to hit 6 RPM and not shift. "
pontiac,sunfire,2005,ToddF, 05/04/2008,Great car overall,4,"I have owned this car 3 1/2 years and driven it 25,700 miles, mostly to and from work. I love it. It has been trouble free, except for a few blown fuses (turn signals and lighter). For the price, I couldn't ask for much more. My complaints about the car are very cheap upholstery(even for a cheap car), lousy cup holders (worthless for anything other than a 12 oz can) and for me the seats are uncomfortable on long trips (although they are fine for short trips) I do avoid taking this vehicle on long trips because of the seats. The car has developed a few squeaks and rattles in the suspension. Overall, though, I love this car and plan to keep it for as many years as it remains trouble-free"
pontiac,sunfire,2005,jas, 05/23/2008,Fun to build on,4,I love my sunfire. I have actually built onto it by putting two 12 in. subs in the trunk and a 1000 watt amp. I also put in a new indash that sweetens up the ride along with lowering it 2 inches and putting 17 inch rims on it. I love my car!!!
pontiac,sunfire,2005,Terrence Simpson, 03/30/2018,"Awesome, reliable, inexpensive car",4,"If you can find one of these with lower mileage, buy it. These cars are very reliable and have good acceleration. If you live in a winter climate, snow tires turn this car into a little tank!

pontiac,sunfire,2005,mak, 10/28/2020,inexpensive and overall a nice car,5,"My father bought our Sunfire in 2005, so I have had this car pretty much my whole life. the seat are very comfortable, I drive three hours home from college and it's great. I think the look of the car is cool and different, which is why I love this car. Parts are fairly cheap, and for somethings, you can just go to the junkyard. Mine has 175,000+ miles on it and runs very well. Only thing is, I do not recommend sitting in the car on idle, it will obviously mess up the radiator. 

Overall, wonderful car, rides nice, very comfortable and looks cool. :)

Yes I replaced one wheel bearing, did the head gaskets, and now adrive train bearing. But it's on it's third lifetime in Midwest Winters and hot summer. We got it with 74k 10 yrs ago. On our third set of tires, we buy Cooper. If I can find another with only 100 k on it, I'll buy it for later on. Love the manuverability.

Get about 17 city/24 hwy mpg. Pros: Very spacious front/rear seating and cargo space; comfortable; reliable; smooth ride for low-price basic crossover class (broad wheel base). Cons: Replaced heating/A/C actuator motor at 53K (+$900 repair) but was GM recall later - contacted dealer, reimbursed same day; replaced wheel bearings at 75K; replaced bolts on exhaust at 86K (apparently common problem on Torrent and Equinox - made exhaust loud - easy $20 fix); slow pick-up at acceleration; odd window controls placement (all in front seat center console)."
pontiac,torrent,2006,variety, 08/31/2011,This will be my last GM vechile,2,"We loved the looks of this car and for the first year it was a solid car.
After that it has been all down hill.
We have now replaced all four wheel bearings and it the paint started flaking off around 50k.
We now have a large spot on the driver side and on the tailgate.
Our dealer told us this was not covered under the supplimental rust protectant we got because it was an issue with the paint."
pontiac,torrent,2006,NRBO, 12/02/2010,PIECE OF CRAP!!!,3,"This make is a piece of crap.  2nd year fuel pump went out, third year the entire ignition system went out.  4th year the heater quits working - apparently this has happened to thousand of this model but GM refuses a recall - the part costs $22 but it costs $1500 for labor because to replace the part requires removal of the entire front section of the car. Look it up - blender acuerator.   My mechanic says it is the poorest designed car he has ever seen and won't even attempt to replace that part.  I am getting rid of this piece of junk as soon as I can.  It is winter in the south and no heater.  The dealership just laughed when asked about ongoing issues with this car."
pontiac,torrent,2006,timmy78, 08/12/2013,Started great but ended badly!,4,"I bought my 2006 Pontiac Torrent in 2009 with only 22k miles on it. The first year and a half, the vehicle was the best that I'd owned. Drove from Memphis, TN to Gatlingburg in the snow, Hattisburg, MS, Meridian, MS, Jonesboro, AR, and Little Rock, AR with no problems. But during my trip to Little Rock, it seemed like I was having trans problems. When I took it to the trans shop, they said it was a speed sensor. Needless to say, the speed sensor kept messing up. I had it replaced 4 times before getting rid of the vehicle. Now, my ex-fiancee's aunt has replaced the trans but the problems persists. And the paint is peeling.

pontiac,torrent,2006,Mike, 11/09/2006,"Good Car, So Far",4,"My wife was bent on buying one of these things from the first time she saw one on ""Survivor."" I was wary, partly because I wasn't thrilled about getting an SUV, and partly because I'm wary of purchasing anything else from GM (or any American auto maker, for that matter).  To be honest, I must admit that I'm pleasantly surprised. The ride is comfortable. and it drives quite nicely. The sound system is more than adequate, and we love the sun-roof and leather heated seats. It doesn't feel top-heavy when rounding corners, and rides more like a car than a truck. We've had no problems thus far. And for the record, I don't ever like admitting when I'm wrong. But this was a good choice."
pontiac,torrent,2006,archie74, 04/08/2011,2006 Not Worth It,3,"Paint on drivers side rear wheel started peeling after 4 years. Dealer dismissed this as it was off warranty and nothing they could do. Paint is now peeling on tailgate, front passenger 1/4, rear driver 1/4 panel and inside the rear passenger door. I'm waiting to see if GM is going to step up as this is not the result of normal wear and tear.

Suspension has a sport feel, different than the sister GM SUVs like it. The wife does not want to get rid of it still,but keeping an eye out for a lower mileage Torrent now to replace it.Edmunds aked for an update: still going strong at 335k miles,had to replace one coolant pipe due to rust.

The one that's bothering me the most is that during the past 23,000 miles I have had the bearings replaced 3 times...  this is not normal, correct? It is in the shop right now and since it is no longer under warranty, they will not pay for the bearings to be replaced again. I am so frustrated and do not know what to do.  Any advice?"
pontiac,torrent,2006,Alice, 02/22/2010,2006 AWD AC problems & car quits running,3,I have a 2006 AWD Pontiac Torrant SUV. I purchased the Torrant in 2006 with 11000 miles on it. It was a loaner car. Love the Torrant when it's not in the shop. I have only had two problems with it. Right from the start the AC would quit working I live in the south so AC is a must. Had the Torrant to my dealer several times & another and they couldn't find anything wrong. Finally after they replaced parts and worked on several things they thought it was fixed. Well it's still not from time to time. Now Torrant is in the shop again. The suv just quits while I am driving. My dealership is great & really trying to repair. Defective code B2105 com lost with ECM BCM to PCM still problem. 
pontiac,torrent,2006,Tim Stout, 08/15/2006,2006 Pontiac Torrent,4,"I have had a Torrent for the past 11 months.  After driving a Montana Mini van for five years, I found the interior room of the Torrent much smaller, with the floor gear shift lever taking up too much room, especially for the right front passenger.  There is not enough leg room for stretching out, even with either front seat all the way back.  The exterior gives the impression of a ""big"" SUV, but the interior does not. The motor is sufficient, but lacks the get up I was use to in the Montana.  So far it has been a reliable vehicle, and should remain that way for years to come.  It has a comfortable but noisy ride, mostly from the tires. The AWD is great in snow when driven with care."
pontiac,torrent,2006,Dave, 06/10/2009,Cheap = Expensive,2,Last winter the heater blend door and actuator broke.  $1300- the entire dash has to be removed to fix a $60 part.  Leather seat has split. Front right wheel bearing needs replacing.
pontiac,torrent,2006,Greg, 09/15/2007,2006 Pontiac Torrent,3,"Overall, the vehicle is a fun SUV to drive. It has 'just enough' power on both the highway and in the city to make short & long trips fun & enjoyable. The vehicle is reliable in most situations and I like the roominess in the interior. The stereo and sound system is nice.  As for the AC, it is about useless in the Las Vegas heat.  Many a times, I simply opened up the windows to cool off rather than tax the AC system.  Passengers in the rear seats cooked.  There is plenty of leg and head room. I have found that the vehicle does not have the much of a turning radius and it has many blind spots; like when backing up or parking. The rear lighting at night from the backup lights is minimal at best"
pontiac,torrent,2006,trish526, 08/06/2008,Worst Car Ever!,1,"This has to be the biggest lemon I ever bought!  It's now 2 years old and it's been in for service over 10 times starting 6 months after I bought it.  It's been in for reasons ranging from a bad battery to the ignition column locking up.  Each time I take it in service claims it's fixed and each time I have the same issue or a whole new one.  I've called Pontiac and GMC and neither can help me.  I'm now stuck in a car that's been deemed unsafe for another 2 years because it will cost me too much to get out.  I cringe whenever I drive the car and brace myself to deal with service centers.  If you want reliable, go with a Honda.  If you want headaches, buy a GMC or Pontiac.  "

The car is exceptionally comfortable; handles well; build quality is excellent.  A pleasure to drive.  Roomy, but deceivingly smaller in appearance.

pontiac,torrent,2006,rayban64, 11/05/2007,One Year Review,3,"We lived in AZ, were moving to VA and needed something for the winter months that could also move a lot of stuff cross-country. The tires are specially made and when we got a flat in Santa Cruze, NM we were stranded for a few days until a new tire came in. It handles well in the snow but the wiper blades are in a well that easily fill with snow and ice requiring you to get out and clean it on dangerous roads. The materials for the interior are very cheap. The turning radius is horrible. Gas mileage is not what they claim. Overall value though is very good and we enjoy it. The clamps on the rack do not hold at all."

I have had this truck 3 years and thus far I have replaced the following: tires, 16 wheel bearings (all by different mechanics to rule out mechanics error), rear end, carrier bearing, CV axles (front and rear), brakes and rotors, 4 alignments (to try and fix the wheel bearing issue), ball joints, control arms, EGR tube, ABS sensor, factory radio (switched for an actermarket as I've heard of sooooo many issues with the factory ones), cruise control, steering column, windshield washer motor, windshield (x3 don't let a pebble hit the glass, ever!), and after JUST putting over a grand in to it not even a month later (which seems to be about the timeline I get in between repairs) the check engine light is on, the alternator is going out, and there is an all too familiar grinding starting back up. I have actually decided to get a second vehicle as this one is in the shop SO MUCH and every time I go to sell it, something else BREAKS and I have to get it repaired. I am not one to beat my vehicles up (I hate paying for repairs!) and this thing STILL is nothing but problems! The interior is also cheaply made as there is paint coming off the door handles and the radio surround. Oh! And the bumper brackets broke about a month after I bought it (and continued to break) so I got innovative and started using cable ties, probably the most reliable part on this entire vehicle!!! STAY AWAY FROM THIS VEHICLE AT ALL COST!!!! I've estimated about 8 grand (so far) in repairs and as soon as the check engine light came on it started idling hard (non-permissible content removed)!

The alternator went at 72,000 km for the cost of $1,000, tires were replaced around the same time, along with rotors and brakes.

On the test-drive I drove it up to 80 mph with no shaking on the wheels.  I like OnStar.  They are very nice and helpful.  When my engine light came on they did a diagnoistic check right then.

pontiac,torrent,2006,DandT, 06/20/2007,"Lots of room, poor fuel economy/engine",2,"This is my first GM product and my first SUV. Great inside - nice and roomy. Can't use front cupholder and e brake at same time. Only 21-22 mpg.Drives wonderfully - very smooth. Very quiet ride. A pleasure to drive until three weeks ago. Carbon buildup in cylinders at only 21,000 miles and I'm not putting trashy gas in it. Something isn't burning right and GM wants to put a band-aid on it instead of finding the cause of the carbon build-up. Ive been without my vehicle for three weeks. Way too new to be having problems.  "
pontiac,torrent,2006,Busy Mom, 07/13/2007,Good for the money...kind of,3,Good looks inside and out help make up for the lack of HP (185) in comparison to some other SUVs. The A/C lacks in hot weather. Dealer says they don't work as well when it's hot out.  Works great in cool/mild weather. Fun ride and very roomy. The sliding back seat is great. 
pontiac,torrent,2006,Margaret, 09/28/2007,It's been good to me so far,4,"Before buying my Torrent, I also test drove it's Chevy sister, the Equinox. The decision maker was the Equinox had scratchy upholstery while the Torrent's was soft and comfortable. The Torrent has proven to be a comfortable vehicle, even for tall passengers riding in the back seat.  Sharp exterior but the interior could use a touch of class. Three design flaws: (1) I don't smoke, but a removable ashtray should be standard for things like gum wrappers; (2) The CD storage area is not easily accessible; and (3) A wider cargo compartment would have been more beneficial than having the small side storage wells.  No mechanical problems (knock on wood). Nice vehicle and GM offered 0% financing"
pontiac,torrent,2006,wax, 04/10/2008,Overall Great SUV,4,"Get a lot of comments about how good the Torrent looks with the 17"" allows.  A very versatile, roomy SUV.  Great pickup and smooth transmission.  Interior materials are somewhat cheap.  Very few reliability issues so far, at the 43,000 mile mark.  The center arm rest design is a disaster.  Would buy it again."
pontiac,torrent,2006,jkmint18, 08/26/2010,I love my TORRENT!,4,"I purchased this vehicle from a family friend who runs the hummer dealership, he said even though Pontiac is out of bus, their cars are still reliable. relatively low miles when purchased, and i've had no problems with this vehicle. Just turned 18, my first car, paying for it myself. want to eventually buy a torrent GXP and bump up to a 263 hp engine. I LOVE MY TORRENT. "
pontiac,torrent,2006,Stacedog, 04/29/2010,Good Value! I have loved my Torrent!,4,"My Torrent has treated me well! Although, I must say I only drive about 10,000 miles a year. I bought it March 2006 and just had to get new tires about a month ago. I have not had any problems with mine at all up until this week. My check engine light came on? I have not gotten it checked out yet but I really don't think it could be much of anything since I have so few miles. Besides that, I LOVE driving it and really has been a good car, especially for what I paid for it! "
pontiac,torrent,2006,reviewer, 09/22/2016,Love this car!,4, 
pontiac,torrent,2006,kim, 12/06/2006,I Love My Torrent,4,"At first, I was not looking to buy another vehicle. One of my best friends sell cars and I went to see her and I saw the Torrent on the showroom floor. Originally, I was looking at the Envoy but I felt it was a little big. The Torrent really caught my eye and I fell in love with it when I saw it. I knew I had to drive it off the lot and thats just what I did. I took the one off the showroom floor. It rides very good and easy to see over the wheel. The sound system is great."
pontiac,torrent,2006,Kathi, 01/16/2007,love it,3,I have driven in the Ozarks and with all the hills and turns the Torrent handles the curves well!
pontiac,torrent,2006,John , 09/09/2005,Great inexpensive Pontiac SUV,4,"I recently bought the new Torrent Suv and really like the car.  I really think you get a lot of car for the price.  Gm continues to step it up and bring itself closer and closer to Toyota quiality.  I would higly reccomend this car to anyone looking for a fun, smaller suv. "
pontiac,torrent,2006,sadiesangel, 06/09/2008,It's been nice,4,"I have had my Torrent for 3+ years now and for the most part have loved it.  I have been told that they are discontinuing this model which is upsetting.  I have had some problems with parts/repairs.  Wished it had a 5 year/100,000 warranty.  I don't think the 3 year/36,000 covers long enough."
pontiac,torrent,2006,Annette, 07/28/2008,Problems with ignition and key assembly,3,"Positive things: roomy inside, and gas mileage is great. Negative things: key ignition locks up. Have had it replaced (cylinder) and still in locks up again. Also had a defect in the wheel bearing and GM first did not want to include in my GM protection plan extended warranty which I purchased at a high price. After reaching GMPP themselves, it was paid. But I had to pay $100 deductible 3 times to get things straightened out."
pontiac,torrent,2006,Joe Cottone sr, 08/06/2008,Damn Good Vehicle,4,"My lease on the 2006 is up next month & am looking to replace it with another Torrent, thats how much I like it. Gas mileage is 16 city 22 hwy, handles well, roomy enough for my 6'2"" 350lb front or back seat. Don't need 3rd seat. I am looking for comfort & economy, the engine has plenty of get up & go when needed. Has plenty of added features that seem to work well when needed, good enough storage space. Great Looking Too!"
pontiac,torrent,2006,Impressed!, 09/05/2008,Super!,5,Awesome leg room in the front and back seats. Comfortable ride. Excellent power and fuel economy. No problems. Reliable and fun to drive. I've owned GM vehicles for years and this is the best one yet.
pontiac,torrent,2006,MAD, 09/11/2008,Awesome! For two weeks.,3,"I was so excited when I bought this car, for the first month.  Then things started happening:  A bracket snapped that held something for the emissions system, another emissions problem, two warped rotors, radio on the fritz, heated seat cushion replaced, coolant sludged up, etc.  Each of these was a separate trip to the shop, the Enterprise rent-a-car guy knew me by name.  All within the first couple months of owning this thing (except for the rotors, that was at 17,000 miles, still ridiculous).  The car is nice looking, functional for all my outdoor needs, lots of features, but overall I can't believe how many issues I've had with it. Worst reliability I've ever had in a vehicle."
pontiac,torrent,2006,Ronzo, 10/01/2008,repairs begin,3,"At 86,000 km about 55,000 mi. the ""big money repairs"" have begun. A front wheel bearing at over $500! If I had known that the '07's had a 100,000 mile  drive train warranty instead of 36,000, I would have bought a year newer-it was the end of the '06 model year anyway! Well, only 2 more years until it is paid for!"
pontiac,torrent,2006,Dave, 10/02/2008,Wheel Bearings Again?,3,"Bought the torrent because it's American made. Have all my 26 years of driving. But this torrent has been fixed 5 times for all of the wheel bearings.  Ignition cylinder as well. Bought brand new tires at 55k, had loud vibrating sound coming from front and back, thought it was the bad tires. Not. The rear wheel bearings are once again going bad!  Gm builds a quality product, but they need to concentrate on their brakes. This gm vehicle is really getting me down. Good thing I purchased a 100k warranty!"
pontiac,torrent,2006,Robin, 11/06/2008,Plugged Heater Core,4,"I've loved my Torrent. It drives great and looks great.  But, I've had it almost exactly 2 years and the heater stopped working.  Per the dealership, I've got a plugged heater core wich is $400-500 to fix. They also have another Torrent in the shop right now with the same problem.  This seems a bit odd to me that 2006 Torrents would start having this problem. Wished it had a 5 year/100,000 warranty. I don't think the 3 year/36,000 covers long enough.  "
pontiac,torrent,2006,shana, 11/11/2008,Love it--had problems,4,"I love my car. Looks good-sporty-but I have named her Christine. A lot of little problems from sensors that would not allow me to put gas in my car (really!) to a freaked out blower motor that would not turn off. (twice) This summer vacationing at the beach, I was caught in a torrential rainstorm. Noticed a horrible wet smell the next couple of days. Yesterday took Christine to get her washed and water came through the dome lights. From the gearshift. And into the floorboard. Warranty gone! What do I do other than be thankful for the drought in my state."
pontiac,torrent,2006,Jocelyn, 12/19/2008,It's OK,3,"So I had a Honda Civic and was forced to get rid of it for an SUV, not happy to begin with. Now I have 45K and my windshield has a 3+ crack that started from the right lower seal! Nothing hit my car. Now it's in my face. My rotors thump and my car won't crank over sometimes. I live in a snowy area and have driven it in the snow but never ever saw the AWD light kick on. It used to shift rough but now it's OK. I guess it was just because it was new. It's OK though, not happy with it but love the sunroof and definitely the stereo and sound system "
pontiac,torrent,2006,Virginia Edington, 04/03/2009,I love this car!,4,"I have owned 13 cars/trucks in 13 years, and this is by far the best vehicle I have owned. Most people say, ""You own a what?"", but after they see it, their opinion changes. The gas mileage is great compared to a large SUV, but not so good compared to a car. This car has better styling than the Equinox. "
pontiac,torrent,2006,Wyoming Guy, 05/04/2009,Happy but won't buy American again,4,"Have owned my Torrent almost 3 years. Over all I have to admit I have been happy with it. I like the roominess, the stereo, and the power. The problems I've had are the right front door speaker had to be replaced, twice. I had to replace the windshield in it, twice. Both times no explanation for why the windshield cracked. Too much flex in the body? Also the remote clicker wouldn't always unlock the car. That seems to be working okay now. The car is nearing the end of it's warranty and I had planned on trading before it expires but the car has depreciated so much that I owe more than it's worth. Now that Pontiac is going away wonder what that will do to the value? My next car will be a Honda"
pontiac,torrent,2006,cacique40, 01/17/2008,First time SUV Crossover owner,4,"This is my first SUV crossover that I have owned and I am very pleased with the performase of this vehicle. It has plenty cargo pace (for my family's needs), and the rear passenger area is big and confortable too (according to my wife). I like the way it handles and the fast acceleration it provides (I am no F1 driver, mind you). My previous car was a 1999 Grand Am, and I loved it until the day I sold it. I am looking forward to own this one for at least 10 years!"
pontiac,torrent,2006,Becki, 06/14/2009,Love the features of this car,3,"I fell in love with this car when I first saw it.  It had so many great features on the interior (heated seats, dark fabric, easy wheel mounted controls, temp. display etc...).  I drove the car off the lot, and 7 days later the check if engine light was on.  After numerous ""smaller repairs"" I noticed a rattling sound and brought it in...the engine needed to be taken out to replace a loose cap inside of it ($3,500) luckily it was covered by warranty.  I absolutely love this car, but it is so unreliable I am trading it in after 6 months.  Now I am also out the $700 I paid for snow tires because of the extended rim size uncommon to other vehicles."
pontiac,torrent,2006,SUNSHINE, 08/20/2009,LAST CHOICE WAS MY 1ST CHOICE!,4,"I researched & drove so many different auto & in the end, I bought the 06 Torrent!I had originally put it on the top of my list; but dismissed it prior to seeing one. After looking at so many vehicles, it was the Torrent that made me excited when I saw it & drove it! Mine is silver with black heated leather; sun/moonroof, 6cd changer; and many other features that I love.The '06 Torrent rose to the top of my list above the 100's of autos that I had saw.I've owned it for 2 mths & love it! I get 20mpg city driving. It's comfy; easy access to everything; so far so good!  I did buy an extended warrantee for piece of mind."
pontiac,torrent,2006,Leann Bell, 10/02/2009,Ask the dealer,4,"Ive had my Torrent for some time now no big problems so far lots of little ones had it serviced the mechanic left radiator cap off over heated on a trip. I asked the dealership how to verify that AWD is operational, said to take it out put it in mud and try to see if it works, GM can't answer this question either. Worried about wheel bearings. Not good work from dealer shop."
pontiac,torrent,2006,Norma, 01/02/2010,Sorry Pontiac is no more; luv my Torrent,4,"Mar 2006 bought brand new 06; Absolutely loved it; less than 40,000 mi since then, totalled last week. So happy with the 06, replaced with new 2009 by phone, sight-unseen, from Hubacher Cad, who ordered from Bay Area (we're in Sacto, CA area.)  Problem: they had no gold, only silver.  Have had 3 days, not driven yet (broken ribs.) Hope it's as great as my gold 2006.  Original like new still, regular maintenance, and only one problem with electrical which dealer fixed immediately.  Only things I didn't like were red lights on dash, and gas gauge ... can't tell when the darned thing's on empty until the gas tank icon lights up!  Would recommend to anyone. sorry Pontiac shut down."
pontiac,torrent,2006,Ife Torrence, 10/24/2005,My Baby,4,"I just bought the torrent about a month ago, from owning a two door cavalier. it drives really smooth, the price is right, and has plenty of room in the back for riders. The leather gives it that luxury feel without the luxury price. i love the heated seats, xm radio, and steering wheel audio controls. One of my favorite aspects of the vehicle is that it feels big inside, but is modest on the outside, it isn't too big, like an escalade or too small like a RAV4, it's perfect."
pontiac,torrent,2006,Stan, 10/27/2005,Excellent SUV - Fun to drive,5,"Excellent SUV!  Drives well and looks great.  Gas mileage is decent, with the engine offering plenty of power and pep.  I'm 6'2"", and I find the seats very comfortable with plenty of legroom.  My Torrent has the ""Crystal Lake"" paint color, which sometimes looks blue, sometimes green, sometimes purple!  GM has definitely improved on their interiors with this car"
pontiac,torrent,2006,FANTASTIC, 10/30/2005,Fantastic,5,"Gm has built a suv that has the best quility, smooth transmission, very quiet. I let my wife drive toyotas,hondas and she picked the pontiac. We have had the torrent for two weeks. Thank you gm!"
pontiac,torrent,2006,Frank J. Konopka, 11/04/2005,Love my Torrent!,5,"I've only owned foreign-made cars for the past 20 years, because I felt the domestic vehicles weren't up to overseas standards. This new Torrent has changed my mind: it's a great car, and I just enjoy so very much driving it! In fact, my wife and I argue constantly about who's going to drive. The luggage room is fine, and I just like the feel of being high off the road, with good visibility all around."
pontiac,torrent,2006,rj , 11/03/2005,1st pontiac,4,"I only have 700 miles but I am pleased with the vehicle. The power is adequate but the mileage should be better. The height is good. the stereo is excellent. The steering feels a little different then I am used to. Overall, I am happy with the car."
pontiac,torrent,2006,CLYDE, 11/06/2005,Fun vehicle,5,This is a really fun suv to drive. I traded in a new hhr because i liked the torrent so much better. Smooth ride.  Easy on gas.  Love it !!
pontiac,torrent,2006,Jose, 11/09/2005,Great vehicle,4,This really puts the ball in the opponents court. This vehicle has been very reliable and has been nothing short of what I need in a family vehicle.
pontiac,torrent,2006,hall, 11/17/2005,this thang is awesome,4,i have no complaints to this point. the torrent drives rides and is super comfortable
pontiac,torrent,2006,Marjorie Hergott, 12/10/2005,Terrific Torrent,4,The torrent is great for Canadian winters. It has no difficulty with snowy or icy streets while at the same time providing a comfortable car- like ride.
pontiac,torrent,2006,Jay, 12/14/2005,As good as Honda Pilot or Rav4,4,"Very nice fit and finish and exceptional features for money.  Handles freeway and in-town driving very well smooths out the bumps in Southern California freeways.  Comfortable seats (couldn't believe they were in a GM product), very good ergonomics and a loud sound system to boot.  Bravo GM, you have a repeat customer in me and won my wife away from buying another Toyota."
pontiac,torrent,2006,alwaysontheroad, 12/22/2005,After two years of shopping...,5,"Until Torrent came along I was not satisfied with any small suv.  They were either sluggish 4-cylinders, too small, had poor gas mileage, or were too plain on the inside (Equinox/CRV).  This one had everything I was looking for and more.  I commute more than 80 miles per day and I love every minute of the drive.  I test drove the base model and steering felt awkward.  I purchased the top of the line model and steering is much tighter.  "
pontiac,torrent,2006,Hal, 12/29/2005,So far-So good,4,Great little vehicle. We went from a Jetta Wagon to the Torrent AWD (Bright White with Ebony Leather)- Sporty! Please bear in mind that we just bought this vehicle yesterday and already have ~250 miles on it.
pontiac,torrent,2006,richard houser, 01/02/2006,06 FWD,4,"Wife and I purchased an 06 fwd torrent as her daily driver. we traded in our 1998 olds intrigue with 114,000 miles, was a great car. we got the preferred package,17"" alloy wheels and the security package. black with ebony cloth interior. we drove an 05 rendezvous and the torrent is more comfortable,stable, quieter and easier to get in and out of. first tank of gas got 21 mpg over some hilly terrain. the rear leg room is great and all the seats are comfortable. it has only 400 miles on the odometer but the engine has plenty of power and is very quiet."
pontiac,torrent,2006,Austin, 01/03/2006,Great SUV,5,A very efficient SUV at an affordable price makes this a great buy. With the Sun and Sound Package this SUV becomes very trendy for younger buyers such as myself. Will be a great commodity for traveling.
pontiac,torrent,2006,BSTinman, 01/05/2006,"""Sporty"" family vehicle",4,"The Torrent has been great so far.  I was in fear that the engine would not be enough, but unless your into drag racing your family SUV I don't think you'll have much to worry about.  A lot of people complain about the steering but I drive 80 miles a day and its not an issue with me...rather pleasant.  The comfort level is tremendous.  Love it."
pontiac,torrent,2006,hmiley, 01/08/2006,Favorite Purchase of 2005,5,"I love, love, love the Torrent.  It is comfortable enough for long rides and roomy enough for a back seat full of grown adults.  I am looking forward to using the sunroof and listening the the pioneer radio very loud!  "
pontiac,torrent,2006,Steve S, 01/07/2006,Outstanding Vehicle,5,The Torrent is an outstanding vehicle. The styling is second to none with plenty of power and great handling. The interior is very well laid out and stylish. Drive 75 plus miles per day and the Torrent handles well and is very comfortable. Handles very well with the AWD.  Quality of the vehicle is excellent. GM definitley got this one right.
pontiac,torrent,2006,JohnV, 01/08/2006,Enjoying New Torrent,4,"I wasn't interested in an SUV until I test drove a Torrent. I was very impressed on how it handled,and how enjoyable it was to drive. The interior also caught my eye with the great amount of leg room in the back."
pontiac,torrent,2006,Joanne, 01/10/2006,A good vehicle,4,"This vehicle handles wonderfully, is spacious, great visibility, and looks quite handsome.  A joy to ride with the added feeling of being safe.  I have already recommended this vehicle to friends and family."
pontiac,torrent,2006,Keith, 01/20/2006,I enjoy my ride,4,Back cargo on the torrent we test drove had cargo cover/table. Very nice feature.  The Torrent we drove off the lot in did not have the same feature.  Sad.
pontiac,torrent,2006,Tammy, 01/25/2006,I love my new Torrent!,4,This is a great auto for someone who likes the bigness of a SUV but wants the better gas mileage and size of a car.
pontiac,torrent,2006,Forrest, 03/11/2006,Fun to drive,4,I maybe shouldn't write about the torrent yet bacause I only have a 100 miles on it but my wife and I really love this car. We came from having a BMW 330I which be both felt was a cramps car after awhile so now having the Torrent we both feel that it has so much room inside and places to store things. We live in CA. not that it gets that cold but the heated seats are really great at times. Power seems to be fine and comfort is great too. One other thing that's great about this car is there's not a million others of these on the road.
pontiac,torrent,2006,Krafty Aunt, 03/27/2006,A Torrent of Engine Problems,3,"SUV was under 4mos old, less than 5,000 miles and started leaking!!  Dealership determined it was a porous, defective engine block!!  New engine installed, but this is not what I expect from a Pontiac. Nor does it give me confidence on continued driving.  My previous Grand Prix GTP hit 156,000 miles without a hitch... will I get this from the Torrent? "
pontiac,torrent,2006,Mrs Ponyac, 03/26/2006,My Sporty SUV,4,"We've owned many Pontiacs over the years and this one stacks up as another winner for us.  I like the feeling of sitting higher up being a shorter person. The interior is roomy with a quiet ride even with the 17"" optional wheels.  The only thing I would change is the steering.  It takes more turns of the wheel to pull into a parking spot, yet on the road it feels fine.  The Chevy version is ok but if you want people to notice what you're driving, this sporty Pontiac is the way to go!"
pontiac,torrent,2006,Steven & Stacy, 03/27/2006,Good Vehicle,4,"We just purchased our Torrent and so far we love almost everything about it.  I have lower back problems so the front seats aren't 100% comfortable for me. (We didn't get power seats, but that would solve my problem.)  We had a Vibe before and after the baby, too small. This is perfect, not too big."
pontiac,torrent,2006,John and Jenn, 04/08/2006,How's your X5,4,"We have 1200 miles on the Torrent and don't have any complaints. This is a good looking vehicle and have received many compliments. Alot of people think it's an X5 or a Lexus. This is huge considering the price difference, twenty grand. Aside from looking good the ride of the Torrent is excellent. If you want a truck buy an X-Terra. This is a SUV to help get the kids to school in a snow storm not to climb Mt.Overacheiver. The back seat is huge and can can accomadate any trip to the home improvement store. I was in a huge thunderstorm last night aside  eighteen wheeler's and the Torrent was solid and handled the dangeourous situation like a champ. 20 miles per gallon going 65-70 with 87oct."
pontiac,torrent,2006,Pete, 04/09/2006,"fun to drive, pig on gas",4,"I blew a wheel bearing after 3 weeks of ownership.  The blower motor bearing is also bad.  I am lucky to get 12L/100km Hwy (40% worse than sticker).  This is gentle hwy driving!!  It is very comfortable, good visibility, lots of space.  Steering is weird and turning radius is a joke.  Hard to believe, but delay wipers are not adjustable.  No navigation system available.  Great in snow, excellent braking, decent acceleration.  Don't waste your money on AWD unless you live in remote snowy areas.  99% of the time it is just extra weight and wasted gas.  Nissan X-trail and Suzuki Grand Vitara feel very cheap and noisy in comparison, and the X trail wasn't much more gas efficient."
pontiac,torrent,2006,raynez, 04/12/2006,raynez,4,"I am 80-yr.old. Ease of entry, head room, cargo space, are just what I needed. The dashboard is easy to read day or night. My family members are all over 6', and they fit well in the front and back seats.  "
pontiac,torrent,2006,Patch, 04/23/2006,A Great SUV,5,"This is a great SUV.  It's got a lot of interior room for the smaller size.  The sound system is nice, but could have more reliable speakers (already broke one).  It is not powerful enough to tow more then a little trailer to the dump.  The 17"" wheels are really nice.  Great SUV."
pontiac,torrent,2006,w31kn1, 04/24/2006,Torrent,4,"I fell in love with the Torrent the moment I saw it.  I found it to be fun to drive and comfortable. While to took so getting use to with the window controls and such, the vehicle was an excellent choice on my part. Power and transmition were no problems."
pontiac,torrent,2006,DARLENE GREEN, 06/03/2006,My first new car,3,I love driving my new torrent that was a gift given to me by my husband of 11yrs. I wish it had cruise control though.  Cruise control should be installed including basic models. The winfdows should be tinted on the basic model as well. I am sure in the future these concerns will be addressed and changed.
pontiac,torrent,2006,AverageGuy, 06/03/2006,Worth the wait,5,"Our 1998 Chevy Tracker fit in the garage allright, ran without any problems for many years; but was always a SUV wanna-be. We needed an SUV that was small enough for the garage but big enough for comfotable trips to and from our daughters college; 450 miles return. The Torrent exceeds our expectations."
pontiac,torrent,2006,Teri Munoz, 06/06/2006,My Mothers-Day Gift From Hubby & Kids,4,I have been looking at this car since November. I told my husband I like this car. it's perfect for me and the kids. I have owned almost every chevy car. This is my first Pontiac and I love it. Thanks to my Husband & kids. 
pontiac,torrent,2006,GREAT SUV!!!, 06/15/2006,Almost bought a toyota!!!,4,"We just bought our Torrent this week so we've only had it for 5 days, but already loving it and every day finding more things to love about it.  And to think, we ALMOST bought a Toyota...until we wandered into the pontiac dealership and saw this vehicle, took a test drive, and the rest as they say is history!  Great looking SUV, great riding SUV, creature comforts everywhere!  Absolutely love the ""extra"" room under the console, especially handy for placing your purse so you don't have to have it next to your feet like in other vehicles.  Love the window buttons -- totally different than any other vehicle out there.  Looking forward to many more miles -- right now we have 67!  Thanks GM!!!"
pontiac,torrent,2006,Kelly Rowe, 07/04/2006,2006 Pontiac Torrent,4,"Great SUV.  Fun on trips, excellent leg room front and year--more than any we looked at.  We got 27 mpg on trips and about 24-25 city miles.  There are a couple of items we wished it had, like the grap bars above all the windows and a different design for the center console.  CD holder in awkward place and the drink holds are rather flimsey, storage pockets in rear would be nice.  Other than that, it's a great SUV for traveling and the fact that the back seat moves forward and backward eight inches really is a plus for this.  Very comfortable car to drive and ride in--plenty of room.  The windshield design is great for sight seeing and the aerodynamics is good as well.  Very little road noise"
pontiac,torrent,2006,norita, 07/04/2006,"What a surprise, I had no idea",4,"That this SUV was out there either until my husband showed it to me online. I had been looking at the Rav4 and the Saturn VUE but when I sat in both vehicles I did not feel exactly as comfortable in them as I did the Pontiac Torrent. I sat in this car and it was like a dream! So roomy, and the rear seat fits 3 comfortably! I had 3 guys over 6 feet tall fit in there with ease. Really, a cool looking vehicle, my  kids are in love with it and so am I! Only have 33 miles but easy to drive. Much better on gas than my Dodge Grand Caravan."
pontiac,torrent,2006,Don Dieboll, 07/06/2006,"Great S U V, for the money",4,"This is a fun suv to drive, very comfortable and great handling on curves, with the awd. Like the pioneer premium 7-speaker sound system. Also like the sun roof, never have had that before on a car. Fuel economy could be better, but you can't have everything. I paid extra for the sporty running boards and they really look great and sporty with them on. Also like the radio controls on the steering wheel."
pontiac,torrent,2006,Jim Knox, 07/11/2006,My new Torrent!,4,"After a great ownership experience with a Saturn Vue (which my son now has), the torrent has much more torque, great five speed tranny, leather, luxury features like heated seats, XM radio, six disc cd, and it's bigger for more cargo too.  The ride is more controlled, quieter and less stressful on the highway - well worth the extra cost.   The fit and finish are exemplary, just can't imagine what the buyers of German and Japanese fail too see in this fine GM product (I'm a former foreign car only owner).  GM's got it now, just hope it's not too late for the General."
pontiac,torrent,2006,Bill H, 07/12/2006,Great SUV for the Price,4,"Excellent value. Great style.  Just drove 3900 miles with the family to Yellowstone / Tetons.  Very comfortable ride with plenty of room, quiet ride.  Leather/Heated seats are great in cold weather.  This is the first new Pontiac I've ever purchased.  Very satisfied. "
pontiac,torrent,2006,Jessica Evilsizor, 07/25/2006,Great Mid Size SUV,5,"I have owned my Pontiac Torrent for 6 weeks and love to drive it!  The interior is amazing with the sun and sand package, 6 disc cd changer, numerous speakers, and of course sun roof, and the gas mileage is not too bad either.  I drive in downtown Indianapolis everyday and still get 22 miles to the gallon."
pontiac,torrent,2006,Happy Dad, 07/24/2006,Birthday Present,5,"I bought this for my daughter for her birthday.  She recently got her license and has adapted very well to the car.  I've driven a lot of different cars and trucks and have a luxury sports convertible.  While it doesn't handle like that car, it does handle very well and has exceptional power so it moves quickly onto highways.  The car is comfortable to drive with good visiblility.  The car has all wheel drive but rides very well."
pontiac,torrent,2006,mark, 08/02/2006,torrent is awesome,5,Best vehicle I've ever bought for the money! Have had absolutely no problems and gas mileage is better than stated!
pontiac,torrent,2006,Jeremy, 08/07/2006,PoorFuel Economy,4,"Father of 2 and happily married, We love out Torrent. But It seems to suck down the gas and we travel on the highway often because we live in a small town so to go shopping or to get to work we are taking frequent 15-20 minute trips. We have only been getting around 240-260 miles per tank? We are wondering if anyone else is noticing this? The specs say we should get over 300? Besides the punch in the face at the gas station we love it and it fits our sporty lifestyle."
pontiac,torrent,2006,G Miller, 09/21/2005,So far so good,4,"I've had my Torrent for a week. I love it! Sure, it's not a Lexus or Infiniti, but it is good value for the money. I happen to like the seats. They're firm, and they don't catch me under the knees like most car seats do. There is very little noise filtering in while on the highway. The back seat legroom is fantastic, as is entry/exit. And if you lower the back seat, you have tons of room. I think GM worked out some of the bugs from the Equinox and has a winner with the Torrent. There are a few things I don't care for, but just about every car has those things we don't like.  I'd recommend it to anyone!"
pontiac,torrent,2006,lildevil, 10/15/2005,Love it!!,4,Ive had my Torrent for about a month and I absolutely love it. Its extremely comfortable to drive with more than enough room for my family of 4 (2 teenagers) and a dog. The ride is extremely smooth for an SUV. I test drove many SUVs and none were compared to that of the Torrent (I test drove the Equinox as the Torrent was not yet available). The Equinox and Torrent are identical except for the aesthetics. The interior chrome accents give it a touch of class. It truly looks and drives and IS a vehicle with class!   
pontiac,torrent,2006,Mick, 12/03/2005,Great Vehicle,4,"I have driven my Torrent up to 9950' in Rocky Mountain National Park partially on ice and snow.  The AWD worked great with no slips or skids!  The transmission worked fine ascending and descending the steep mountain roads.  It was fun motoring up and down the tight roads with a positive feel of the road in such a nicely equipped SUV.(It operates fine here on the level in town, too.)  I now have 2500 miles on my Torrent with no problems."
pontiac,torrent,2006,dekes1, 12/02/2005,06 Torrent AWD,4,"Overall impression: Rides excellent, feels closer to a sedan than to a truck .  Handles suprisingly well for an SUV but is still a 3700 pound vehicle so it's no sports car. One of the best looking SUVs on the road in my opinion, similar to a Lexus RX330 (but not as smooth as the Nissan Murano). It would be nice to see a sporty version with a bigger engine and dual exhaust but overall this is a great value SUV."
pontiac,torrent,2006,Adam McEntee, 12/18/2005,A very nice surprise!,4,"Great daily drive.  Didn't even know Pontiac had a small suv, went to get an Envoy.  Very nice ride most people think it is an import suv. Real nice ride, very agile."
pontiac,torrent,2006,Dick, 01/11/2006,Pontiac Excitement,4,"Rides and handles very well with the stiffer, sport-tuned suspension. Spacious enough to be very comfortable for 5 adults and more than adequate storage. Plenty of pep under any condition to which I've exposed it. AWD performs admirably. Style-wise, it's been mistaken for a BMW. Great buy for the buck."
pontiac,torrent,2006,D.R.Montville, 01/16/2006,Great In The Snow,4,"Purchased this vehicle about 5 wks ago and have about 1000 mi. on it now. It replaced a 2004 Cadillac cts which is rear wheel drive. Even with traction control, it was useless when there was snow on the roads. Living in central New England, we need something that allows us to get to work in a storm.  The Pontiac Torrent fills the bill in this area very nicely. It also is a nice looking vehicle that is fun to drive. Couldn't ask for much more."
pontiac,torrent,2006,Too New To Know, 01/26/2006,Too New To Know,3,"Its a little too new to know everything aout my new Torrent, but am looking forwrd to learning more.  Only have 450 miles, but have already driven in snow and ice and Torrent appears to handle well.  Had a 98 AWD Astro minivan and loved the AWD feature. I also like sitting up a little higher than in a car. There does seem to be a bit of road noise, but that could be the 17"" tires. Also, noticing little less visibility to the side and rear than I am used to and the gas mileage so far hasn't been as good as expected, but maybe that's just the break in period.  Like I said, its too new to know everything."
pontiac,torrent,2006,Russell Pinto, 01/25/2006,A nice ute,3,"A pretty Ute (black). Ride is nice and I think it handles fine. Powertrain is too small, and considering the mileage is realistically 16-18 a bigger motor is in order. Overall I like it."
pontiac,torrent,2006,dhalbach, 02/15/2006,Former auto Europhile,4,"Have had the AWD with all the goodies for 850 miles now and am pleased. The AWD has performed well in the little snow and slush we've had. Nice power, ride and handling for such a vehicle. Good looking inside and out. Hauls long pieces of lumber well. I've owned 5 BMWs and largely avoided US vehicles until I got a GMC Canyon to go 4x4ing. Had a good experience with that, so when I discovered that crew cabs don't fit into the 80 year old garage in the house I just got decided to give GM another chance and on paper the Torrent fit my needs better than anything else. Have been turned off by the recent quality problems with Euro cars. So far so good, and, my teenage daugter likes it too!"
pontiac,torrent,2006,Low Lou, 03/05/2006,Good move by Pontiac,4,Wife saw it on shopping lot parking lot and said this is the car she wanted. Not too big and not too small. It is easy to get in and out of. Very nice design inside and out. She loves the controls and especially the space under the front arm rest to place her purse and etc.  Great features for the money. We love the heated leather seats. This is her shopping car and so far it has been very convenient for her to use. 
pontiac,torrent,2006,Doug, 03/16/2006,Totally Excellent !!!,4,"I love the styling , the ride and the handling of this vehicle. All of the controls are visible and easy to reach . The seating is firm and comfortable . This vehicle feels solid on the road , easy to drive ."
pontiac,torrent,2006,Pam, 04/03/2006,Love it,4,This is the nicest vehicle I've ever owned.  It's beautiful inside and out.
pontiac,torrent,2006,Jones, 04/04/2006,First SUV experience,4,"This is my first SUV. I love it. The Torrent is fun, roomy, comfortable and stylish. The back seat has lots of room for the children. The idea of adjustable rear seats is great. I would recommend the Torrent to any first time buyer or anyone that has experience with SUV's."
pontiac,torrent,2006,Theresa, 04/13/2006,New Owner,4,"So far, I love it. My only real complaint is that there are a couple of nasty blind spots I need to get used to. Otherwise, one of the nicest riding, most comfortable vehicles I've ever been in. I got the Sun and Sound package and really like the upgraded stereo. I love the auto volume control feature on the stereo that adjusts the volume up at freeway speeds and down at stops.  I also like the gas tank on the passenger side. It makes it easier to find an empty pump since everyone else has their's on the driver side. "
pontiac,torrent,2006,Christine, 04/27/2006,No complaints,4,So far I think the car is great. A few minor modifications to interior set up could be made but otherwise all around it's a fine car. 
pontiac,torrent,2006,Great little SUV, 05/02/2006,Great Little 'ute,4,"I researched and then some in my attempt to buy a small to midsize SUV, looked at the VUE and wasnt impressed, Envoy and Trailblazer are too overpriced, I saw the Torrent and took her for a drive and all i can say is that it I enjoy it thoroughly, nice get up and go, and roomy as hell interior, and price was great, i paid $21,000 for 2wd with the 17 in wheel package, I recommend it to anyone in the market for a small to midsize SUV"
pontiac,torrent,2006,Stephanie, 05/10/2006,I love my car!!!,5,This is the best car I've ever owned!!!! I am a total Pontiac lover and highly reccomend the Torrent to any one!
pontiac,torrent,2006,Frenchyis home, 05/10/2006,love it,4,"I totally enjoy driving this car. I had no problem making the change from a car. The torrent gives you a very secure ride, and handles like a dream"
pontiac,torrent,2006,Ed Derendinger, 05/13/2006,Rides like a SUV,3,"I had my Torrent for 3 months and enjoy the room, but for people looking for a SUV/car I don't recommend. Looks and drives like a SUV.  "
pontiac,torrent,2006,Cheri Dingfelder, 05/26/2006,Torrent,4,The rear seat is wonderful.  It has so much space between the front seat. I am not getting kicked while I drive from the kids.  Gets much better gas mileage than my Gran Prix that I traded in and the drive feels the same.
pontiac,torrent,2006,TT, 06/10/2006,Nice suv for the money,4,"I was shopping for a wagon with good gas mileage and lots of room.  I narrowed it down to the Magnum and the Torrent  It came down to price and resale value.  I picked up the Torrent used with 7200 miles for 16,900 with the standard package which by the way gives lots of options.   I liked the styling on the Torrent and enjoyed the peppy response on the throttle.  I was also suprised by the quietness of the cabin.  Ride is really nice, very smooth and the engine barely makes a murmur.  I love the room in the back seat and the cargo area is superior to lots of larger suvs in function all the seats fold down including the front passenger seat for added length.  Much nicer than the Vue."
pontiac,torrent,2006,Mike Sunderland, 06/10/2006,Terrific vehicle!,4,"I was first attracted to the Equinox because of its styling and size.  Then I compared it to the Pontiac Torrent.  The Torrent won hands down!  It has a much bolder and classier appearance than the Equinox just by a few design changes.  My Torrent came equiped with all the bells and whistles that most of the Equinox cars did not have.  I love every feature of the Torrent!  With only a few minor modifications, the Torrent could be as good as it gets at any price.  Since I'm 6'2"" my main concern was leg room and comfort.  The Torrent fit this requirement perfectly.  It is also equipped with a very reliable and proven GM power plant.  I highly recomment the Pontiac Torrent as your new vehicle."
pontiac,torrent,2006,doucon, 06/10/2006,Excellent SUV,5,This is our first SUV and it is wonderful.  It does have a bigger blindspot than the other cars we have had but that is the only bad thing.  We love the amount of space you can have with the seats folded down.  The rear seat leg room is excellent.
pontiac,torrent,2006,Tim, 06/09/2006,back to general motors,4,"First of all, GM is priced much better than most companies with HQ's overseas.  You can dicker with the price for the same quality much more than with Honda or Toyota or Mercedes, etc.  Secondly, the build quality is at least equal now---just look for yourselves.  My buddy works for Cadillac---he knows its true and now I do too.  My Pontiac is trim and big and powerful enough to serve my needs-- -it feels good and with black leather the interior has the right stuff.  FULLY equiped the price was thousands less than 4 runner or Highlander or Honda.  "
pontiac,torrent,2006,B. Puthoff, 06/28/2006,New Buyer,4,"I just purchased my Torrent 5 days ago. I have had prior Pontiac vehicles, and so far, so good. I do notice more wind noise with the sunroof. I don't know if it's the pop-up wind deflector or the roof rails that I hear the wind noise from. I also agree that the steering feels ""loose"" and slow to respond. But I'm also used to a Grand Prix GT ! Well, here's hoping that GM is in the market with the oversees competitors."
pontiac,torrent,2006,King, 07/14/2006,My Torrent,4,I love driving my Torrent. It's fast and comfortable and the best buck for the bang.
pontiac,torrent,2006,vicki powers, 07/17/2006,The Pontiac Torrent Rocks!,4,"I love my new 2006 Torrent. I wish there wre more colors available though. The purple haze almost looks brown in the light instead of purple. We chose the blue metalliac streak. Awesome color. My Torrent handles very well, and the amenities are too many to count. My Dad now has lots of leg room in the back seat. Very stylish. We just love it."
pontiac,torrent,2006,G.M.Weber, 07/17/2006,2006 Pontiac Torrent,4,"Pleasant vehicle with easy handling, very responsive, and fun to drive.  Adequate amount of space in rear and moveable rear seat to add more storage space is excellent.  Tail gate raises high to clear one's head when open. Nice hand holds for bringing it down.  Should NEVER put black interior in a SUV - as it shows every bit of dust/dirt, and a SUV is for working~! "
pontiac,torrent,2006,Robert Schleimer, 07/19/2006,Great,4,Only disapapointment is fuel economy. 22 MPG on trip and 18 in city
pontiac,torrent,2006,queens, 07/28/2006,2006 AWD Torrent,4,"I saw an ad for the Torrent and just loved the look.  I was hesitant about buying one because I never saw one on the road.  It's my first experience with an SUV and I love driving it.  I got it fully loaded with the safe, sun and sound packages. The seats are very comfortable and the back seat is roomy and seats fold for more storage. I love the six disc cd changer and the sun roof"
pontiac,torrent,2006,Jim, 08/10/2006,Great ride,5,"I have owned some very expensive vehicles, but none ever rode as quietly, comfortably and firmly as my Torrent, nor were they as much fun to drive. For $25,000, it is the bargain of the year as far as I am concerned. "
pontiac,torrent,2006,Roger Rosswaag, 08/28/2006,I love my Torrent!,5,The 2006 Torrent is my first new vehicle in 3 years. I am very happy with it so far. It's a great looking car and fun to drive. I also got an excellent lease deal too!
pontiac,torrent,2006,Dale, 09/06/2006,Great bargain,4,"I like the vehicle.  I traded in a 2004 Vibe GT.  I wasn't expecting handling like the Vibe, but the Torrent rides firm, corners well, and has good performance.  I get 21 mpg overall but recently took a 600 mile road trip; 5 people and luggage and got 25 mpg.  I could not fit 5 in the Vibe.  The steering is a little light at low speeds. I'd like to see GM put their 3.9 litre in this vehicle"
pontiac,torrent,2006,Cyndi, 09/07/2006,I love my Torrent!,5,"I just love my Torrent.  It handles nicely, I would recommend the Torrent to anyone!  It is roomy inside.  "
pontiac,torrent,2006,Mia , 09/12/2006,Love That Torrent,5,"This is my first SUV.  So far so good.  I love the room in this vehicle.  I love the console and that everything is controlled from the center even the windows.  Gas Mileage is great. It costs no more to drive than the car I had.  I am getting a lot of compliments. ""Nice!"""
pontiac,torrent,2006,mike, 10/02/2006,Good blend of style and function,4,"The Torrent was appealing to us for its superb styling, as well as capable functionality.  The much-maligned 3.4L V6 is plenty powerful for normal drivers, while fuel economy for us is commonly BETTER than the EPA sticker estimates.  Handling is decent, and I have no complaints about the feel of the electric-assist steering.  The interior is beautifully styled, but it could use some tightening up in some places to make it top notch.  Overall, we could hardly be any happier with our Torrent."
pontiac,torrent,2006,Fred Holt, 10/09/2006,Vacation,5,On a trip from Ala to the Grand Canyon and then on to Yellowstone Park and the Teton Mts. The Torrent was very comfortable and roomy. Fuel Economy was great approximately 25 to 27 on Hwy. Had no problems it performed perfectly.
pontiac,torrent,2006,Sandra Dicks, 01/08/2007,On/Off Public Roads,4,"Vehicle purchased for AWD capability. We live in cottage country on 2 mile privately maintained gravel road in a snowbelt area.  Have put 6000 miles on vehicle since mid August 2006, including a round trip to Florida of about 3000 miles.  The Torrent has been a delight to drive and handles well in all weather conditions including snow, slush and ice covered roads through through the mountains.  Although not quite as roomy as our previous 2003 Pontiac Montana it comfortably holds all our luggage, golf clubs/pull carts and two Bikes (hitch mounted). Our trim level includes leather, 17 inch wheels and premier Pioneer audio system. Acceleration and handling is good, except for turning radius. "
pontiac,torrent,2006,Linda, 01/13/2007,Love my Torrent,4,"I purchased this Crossover vehicle last February. I have been very happy. It is very fun to drive has a lot of power. Almost as much as my 2000 Grand Am which I loved!! I have only one complaint in design. I am about 5'8"" but when i have to clean snow off the windshield, the way the windshield is kinda of recessed its hard to get the snow off the windshield. I love the self dimming mirrors, I got my car at night and when I was driving home from the dealer I discovered these. Nice stereo system I have the 6 cd changer. I get more compliments on the color of my Torrent, I have the Crystal Lake color. All in all I love my Torrent!!"
pontiac,torrent,2006,Tom, 01/17/2007,2006 Pontiac Torrent,4,"One minor problem requiring return to dealership. Fuel economy not quite up to projected EPA ratings. Quiet, smooth ride & good interior room. Should have rear disc brakes."
pontiac,torrent,2006,David, 01/24/2007,Miles Per Tank,4,The Miles per tank on our 2006 torrent are not good. With only a 16.6 gallon tank at 19 mpg we are only getting about 300 miles per tank. The needle drops fast and before we know it another stop for fuel. The 2007 has a 20 gallon tank!
pontiac,torrent,2006,AK, 03/22/2007,Very happy with vehicle.,4,"I leased my 2006 on Christmas Eve 2005. I am very impressed at the amount of interior room the vehicle has. I am a tall individual so I drive with the seat all the way back and reclined. Not one complaint from passengers seated directly behind me. Reliability so far has been top notch. I like the way the dashboard is situated. Only complaint I have is, I think the manufacturer could have made the vehicle more powerful. 185 horsepower is just not enough for this sized vehicle. A sufficient amount would be about 215 horsepower."
pontiac,torrent,2006,Laura, 03/27/2007,So Much Fun,4,"I love my Torrent. I have had it for over a year now. With its sporty look and get up and go, it is so much fun to drive. My major reason for buying this vehicle was for its looks and the price for all the features you get."
pontiac,torrent,2006,Stewart Williams, 05/30/2007,Solid Comfort,4,"It drives easily and offers a very comfortable ride. I especially enjoy driving it on long trips. It seems to ride most comfortably when it's fully loaded with cargo and passengers. Its V6 gives me plenty of power to ease onto Interstate highways and it climbs over the mountains of Western Maryland with ease. The 5 speed transmission is the smoothest shifting one I've ever experienced. I would rate the Torrent as a very good vehicle, but Pontiac would do better by not using so much cheap plastic around the dash area. Also, the front seat cup holder and emergency break placement are very poorly designed.   "
pontiac,torrent,2006,Macadew, 10/16/2007,Torrent Terrific,4,"A fun SUV to drive with a very stylish exterior. Comfortable for long trips in both front and rear seats. Smooth ride, quiet interior and handles well in all weather. Instrumentation panel is easy to read during the daytime, but all the red at night makes it a little harder to see. Cup holders in front in awkward spot with emergency brake hitting them when pulling up. Turning radius needs tightened up some. Overall extremely satisfied with Torrent and would buy another one. Looking forward to seeing GXP edition."
pontiac,torrent,2006,Susan, 03/26/2008,Can't Say I'm Thrilled,3,"As my first SUV, I loved it at first.  Then hit the winter and I felt like I had no car around me.  Slid everywhere and even did one 360 - fortunately, no injuries and no damage.  Put weight in back, but wheel bearings could take it.  It's a beautiful car, but I just don't feel safe.  And a year ago I was able to get up to 23 mpg - now lucky if I get 19.  What's up?"
pontiac,torrent,2006,Inwisconsin, 03/31/2008,Glad to see it gone!,3,"I have to say I am glad I got rid of my Torrent. The gas mileage was truly the clincher of me getting rid of the vehicle. The window sticker is not even close to what the true gas mileage is. Had the vehicle for one year, NEVER got over 17 on the HWY, and about 13 in the city! Had many minor problems but annoying after awhile to take in for this and that, and a day without the vehicle, thank god they have courtesy transportation. Right before it was traded in, I had put in 89 octane gas and my engine light came on, I was told by the dealership NOTHING BUT cheap gas as it was a small combustion engine? Very odd issues, but glad its gone! "
pontiac,torrent,2006,Kevin, 04/01/2008,Excellent Crossover with some drawbacks,4,"I have to say that this spacious SUV is very comfortable (including the spacious back seats) and very fun to drive. I have never really struggled with the cargo aspect of the car, and it is a good look inside and out. I love taking this car anywhere (beach, road trips, etc.).  However, I have had trouble starting up the car especially on short trips. Sometimes, it doesn't even start the first (or sometimes second, or third) time! That is outrageous for a brand new car. Granted, I haven't had them look at it yet, but I have heard the same thing from other Torrent drivers. Also, the cup holders cannot be used with the hand break up, which is a pain when you live on a hill."
pontiac,torrent,2006,Stacy, 04/01/2008,Comfortable and Roomy,4,I've only had my Torrent for a few weeks now but I love it. I went from a 1992 Blazer junk that served me well but what a change for me! I only saw the car once in a restaurant parking lot and said that was the car for me. It's very comfortable and roomy.  It has good acceleration too but I think it doesn't have good gas mileage.  Overall I recommend it.

pontiac,torrent,2006,Amanda, 02/18/2019,Saftey was amazing,4,"I have a 2006 Torrent i recently came into some weather conditions and slid into a ditch. I caught a support cable and rolled my torrent and i drove it away. I was unharmed as my seat belt kept me secure. While rolling i came to rest on my passenger side. I was able to easliy climb out. I didnt even crack a window! So glad i was in a torrent. UPDATED: it's been 5 months since my roll over. I needed a new hood and some body work but everything still runs. All the damage was cosmetic.
"
pontiac,torrent,2006,Deb, 11/16/2019,Love this SUV,5,Bought in 2009 used with 60K miles.  We have taken this car everywhere to include cross country.  It has surpassed our expectations.  We only had to replace an ignition switch early on but that's it.  Rest is normal mx.  The 6 CD changer and heated seats still work after a decade for us.  The car has a bit of road noise but the car is great.  First to offer moving back seat to accommodate whatever you are hauling.
pontiac,torrent,2006,Dan, 12/05/2019,An okay car...,2,"Owned a 2006 Pontiac Torrent AWD up until a few years ago, bought it used in 2009. The wife and I liked it at first but then came the notorious GM paint scabs, paint peeling off everywhere!!! It was discouraging since I like to detail my cars top to bottom and you see bare metal everywhere. The plastics and other trims where extremely cheap and delicate, electronics failed multiple times, I'd replace the hubs prematurely and it would still upset the ABS system. The AWD system was meh...It would make you lunge forward very aggressively once you lost traction in the front tires, perhaps that's why the rear driveshaft had to be replaced ($780), Then the rear diff exploded (don't recall how much it cost). Don't get me wrong, the Torrent was really fun to drive and had a surprisingly peppy 185hp V6, but the gas mileage was horrendous, it may have been a smaller tank, but a trip to Toronto Canada from up north where I live is 340kms and I had to fill up once or twice in between....It was that bad.

pontiac,torrent,2006,Johny, 08/12/2020,"Fun car, frame giving out now",4,"I loved driving this car. I ran it to 175,000 and bought it at 135,000. Its a fun car to drive in my opinion and major mechanical problems were few. Hub assembly had to be replaced and the muffler had to be replaced. There may have been one or two more things that needed done, but I can’t quite remember. That is to be expected with an older car. Both of those problems were around 150,000 miles. Also, the cd player broke. My sister has the same car and we had those same problems. The frame and rust is the biggest downfall. It is pretty bad at 175,000. Both my sister and I needed it welded at some point too. I assume if you take better care of it, its better (not sure if mine was kept in a garage before I bought mine). Overall, sad to see the car go because I did love it, but it had to because of rust and frame.

pontiac,torrent,2007,Ricardo, 10/29/2006,Best SUV/Station wagon ever,5,"Love our 2007 Torrent!  Great combination of MPG, HP, Weight, Styling and Handling.  I think GM has really gotten their act together.  This SUV has all the options and still is about $25,000 less than some of its competitors.  Looks great and and handles great and its safe too..."
pontiac,torrent,2007,Dan, 09/22/2006,Excellent Features/Fun to Drive,5,"We Love our 2007 Torrent.  The new interior layout with the Driver info Center is excellent.  The New Onstar Nav feature is just as good or better than a screen nav, and it comes included with onstar.  The info center gives fuel econ which is important to us.  We have averaged about 21-22mpg mixed City/Hwy.  The radio functionality is great, with XM built in, and a aux jack for ipods, etc.  Would highly recommend this car to anyone wanting alot of space, a solid quite ride, and many features, for a great value.

pontiac,torrent,2007,stillluvit, 09/25/2014,Still keeps on going,4,"I bought mine new in 2006 with all options except AWD...didn't need it...had great tires...now it has 159000 miles and continues to be comfortable, quiet and great on gas...don't know where the naysayers got there's or how they drove it...if Pontiac still sold these, I'd get one."
pontiac,torrent,2007,brent, 07/24/2006,Great little Pontiac,5,This is a true Pontiac with its style and features and far less price then many in its class. I live in Montana and  have never had a problem with snow in the back country or just going on a sunday drive ( I have the AWD ) Just a fun little SUV to drive.
pontiac,torrent,2007,RODEONan, 11/11/2010,Love my '07 Torrent,5,"Guess I got lucky, I love my Torrent! We downsized from a Chevy Suburban. Sure there are little things like the chrome on the shifter, a spot on the outside mirrors can catch the sun just right @ 0600 & the rubber seal on the front windows can come loose, needing pushed back in, but overall, very reliable car.  Handles great in snow, mud, rain & in the fields.  Other cars slip & slide, mine stays true, haven't felt this good behind the wheel since dads '80 Auto 4WD AMC Eagle, my '80 Mazda GLC (rear wheel drive) & my '93 Subaru Loyale (on demand 4WD). Folks carried star route mail rts, we've driven all kinds of cars in all kinds of conditions. We find a car we like, we try & keep it!"
pontiac,torrent,2007,bandaide, 05/20/2015,Unsafe and gm knows this!,3,Gm has posted a service bulletin on the stabilitrack control steering issue yet choose to overlook it knowing that people have died from this. I bought my car a year ago because I love pontiacs. I regret every day I turn the key as I wonder if it will be my last from driving this car. I cannot take it on long trips as the steering starts going (stabilitrack) which is a well know problem. I have tried to get a dealer to fix this but they say it's all on me as gm has not seen fit to deem this known issue as a recall though it is widespread and deadly. Perhaps it is because you no longer make them and figure we will eventially we will all go away. You are right-go away to a ford!!
pontiac,torrent,2007,Gail, 02/01/2007,I Think We Have a Winner,4,"Had my heart set on a Rav 4 for over a year. Spent about that much time researching all similar vehicles for everything from MPG to TCO My husband recommended I look at this and I'm glad I did. It is beautiful, stylish, has longer power train warranty, rides well has better peripheral vision area. The Crystal Lake is an awesome teal color. Rich looking and a little different than your standard blue or green. The best part was the price. Leather, Onstar, XM radio, side curtain airbags and still about $2500 less out the door than the RAV4. Would recommend this to anyone. Mileage is a little less than expected but my husband insists it's because the engine is new"
pontiac,torrent,2007,ashleyxmarie, 12/09/2011,"Sigh, at least the car LOOKS nice.",3,"Only good thing is the styling and power.Bought it as a ""GM certified pre-owned""vehicle going through a 101-point inspection. LIES. Purchased it with 33,000 miles on it. It nwo has 68,000. Since purchasing the car several things have occurred: Valve stems cracked within three weeks of purchase & had to get the car towed because of the flat tire. GM paid for the towing. Alternator went out in one year. Spoiler (YES, the SPOILER) became loose and came off
and they didnt cover it. GM customer service a joke! The car randomly leaks in the back when going into a high pressured car wash. Black cloth seats get mysterious irremovable water stains? Sucks in the snow/ rain. Traction control is a joke"
pontiac,torrent,2007,JeremyH, 02/11/2008,Best all-around SUV,4,"Looking for an SUV  I wanted something that was a) all wheel/4 wheel drive b) could pull at least 3,500 lbs c) get decent gas mileage, d) have cool-wow features e) have above average build quality & f) not cost me $30-K.  I found that the CRV & Rav4 cant pull a boat & looked toyish.  The Escape is smaller & gets worse gas mileage.  Likewise, the Dodge Nitro/Jeep Liberty twins have lower MPGs, & they just didnt have a quality feel.  The Torrent feels roomier inside than any of the other SUVs, & its reliability ratings are good.  Overall feel is that of a more expensive import.  Gas mileage has been what I expected too:  17 city & up to 25 highway."

I had to use the spare in the middle of winter and had to chip ice in the middle of a snow storm to access my spare!!!  I almost tore out the wires for the trailer plug removing it!
Car washes and heavy rain fill this compartment up to the tire!!! I have caulked all possible leak points that I can see to no avail.  Any help in this matter would be appreciated. "
pontiac,torrent,2007,L Bgard, 07/23/2010,Stabilitrak,3,"I bought my vehicle in June 07 and less than 6 mths later the back tires locked up (while I had my 2 mth old in the car!) and the stabilitrak lights came on. Brought it to the dealer and they fixed (so I thought). One month after my warranty ran out, the light came on again and my steering wheel locked up. I didn't bring it back to the dealer, but figured out it must b a computer glitch. If I turn my car off wait a few seconds then turn it back on, the light normally goes off and the wheel unlocks. This must be a problem with this particular vehicle! Don't purchase this vehicle in an awd! The paint on the window buttons located by the stick shift rubbed off. Looks like crap now. Seat stitching pulled apart"

I walked away from a major accident with bruises. Vehicle is great on gas and is fun to drive. Cup holder and emergency brake are placed in a poor position but everything else is exceptional. Never purchase AFTER market products with this vehicle.. Dealer installed sunroof and it caused battery failure many times. Also, I thought this truck did not ride well in rain and snow but now realize after reading this site realize this may be a MAJOR fault with this vehicle. Traction control is poor and ironically my accident occurred in the rain.."

pontiac,torrent,2007,azalea25, 10/02/2007,Torrent kept us safe,4,"After much research for a safe but affordable SUV, we purchased a Torrent in August. Unfortunately, after only a month of ownership, a teenage driver rear-ended us and pushed us into a school bus. Thank God no one was hurt, but the Torrent was totaled.  I credit the Torrent for keeping my son and me safe inside even though the outside was badly mangled.  I shudder to think what would have happened had we been in a different vehicle.     "

I am absolutely disgusted with the Torrent, the fuel mileage isn't at all what I expected, the Stabilitrak has caused nothing but issues, there is a rumble up the centre of the vehicle everytime the roads are just wet. Not to mention the lack of control in the snow, I will never buy another vehicle with AWD again, nor will I deal with GM ever again! Their customer service and assistance have proved to be useless!

Talk about incompetent. The stabil-a-trac light comes on and I lose power almost causing accidents every time. I almost got rear-ended yesterday. Please do your homework beofre buying this vehicle. I think the mechanics that are working on it are borrowed from Toyota if you know what I mean. Thank God I leased this junk piece.
pontiac,torrent,2007,Happy, 06/24/2008,I'm Happy,3,"My 2007 Torrent is the first brand new vehicle I have ever purchased.  I was used to driving a Camaro, but wanted something roomier and better in bad weather.  I haver been very pleased with my Torrent.  I get approx 22 to 23 mpg which I am happy with.  I agree with everybody else in saying that the parking break and cup holders should be restructured so they could be used at the same time, and also the location of the cigarette lighter is hard to get to when you are using the cup holders.  Everything else is GREAT!  I would definitely suggest a Pontiac Torrent to anyone."
pontiac,torrent,2007,Rich, 03/14/2007,Better Than Expected,4,"Had decided on either a Ford Freestyle or a Toyota RAV-4, but drove a Torrent and liked it much more than the Equinox I had driven earlier.  The price versus options was better than the other two vehicles I tried. The ride is comfortable and visibility is good.  I also like the fact that the vehicle has stabilitrak and traction control.  Mileage is about 22 mpg overall."
pontiac,torrent,2007,Heather, 03/16/2009,Not a winter vehicle,2,"My Torrent is definately not a winter vehicle. Slips and slides and I get zero traction. Basically, I come to a rolling stop at stop signs, because I know I won't get traction to get going again.  The traction control is a joke. I had my Torrent for a month, and the traction control went out. They claimed they fixed it, but it still doesn't work properly.  Will be trading for a roomier SUV, this fall.  Also, you'd think for a smaller SUV, it would get better gas mileage. I can get as bad as 9 mpg, driving in town, and up to 25 on the highway. For how small it is, I would like to see it get way better mileage than that!!"
pontiac,torrent,2007,Netyoda, 07/24/2006,Fair,4,"This SUV crossover is a good attempt by Pontiac but seems to have been more of an afterthought than a outright new vehicle. Oversights with Interior items such as a poorly placed cup holder (blocks the Emergency brake) which also allows drink-sweat to drip directly into a accessory outlet directly below the cupholders. The instrument cluster is eay to read and the blood-red color is nice at night.  Although overall i am very happy with this vehicle, i woould appreciated more attention to detail such as the drink holders and the clips holding the sun visors. The clips do not firmly hold the visor so they sometimes come loose when driving."
pontiac,torrent,2007,S.Roylance, 11/17/2008,Love It,4,"We took our Torrent for test drive and knew that this was our vehicle. I love the leather seats. The only thing that I would like to see is the cup holders and the emergency brake changed. They are a pain where they are and the window controls took a bit to get used to, but overall I love my Torrent and will be buying another one when this one is too old. "
pontiac,torrent,2007,LS, 07/09/2009,A pleasure to drive,4,"This is my first NEW car. Prior to this purchase, my new car was a 1992 Saturn that we bought in 2000, 45,000 miles. I have truly enjoyed my '07 Torrent. Purchased it in November of 2007 with 14,000 miles. It now has over 45,000 miles on it. We have driven it everywhere, Hot Springs, AR, Marksville, LA and Greenville, TX and several other family vacations. It's very comfortable,lots of room, great on gas and stylish. I was the only one with a Pontiac Torrent in our city and now they're everywhere; all colors. Our only problem, we had to replace a cracked spark plug at 40,000+ miles.StabiliTrak worked good when coming out of Greenville during a bad thunderstorm. Would buy again."
pontiac,torrent,2007,Matt, 09/25/2009,07 Torrent,4,"I have owned my 07 torrent for two years now and love it!  I have the upgrade package with XM, stereo upgrade, chrome polished wheels.  I now have 53,000 miles on oit and I am looking at the new Torrent GXP.  Bigger V-6.  The only problem I have had with mine is the front wheel bearing went out on both sides.  The dealer took care of it under warranty and gave me a rental.  Tones of room for a samll to mid size SUV.  Towes 3,500 lbs too!!"
pontiac,torrent,2007,chestnuts, 11/14/2007,Could be better,3,"Having driven my new Torrent for about 4 months now, I do find a few annoying shortcomings. The controls on the Steering Wheel are terribly designed. The 3 cruise control buttons (and those for the radio too) are much too small for a man's finger! I must take off my eyes off the road and actually look to find the right button, then use my fingernails to activate the control button.In short, a terrible design. I now have 12,000 Miles on it and I am ready to replace the tires. Especially in rainy weather, a little acceleration and the wheels start to spin! No traction whatsoever -very disappointing.  I feel car should have more power. In normal overtaking maneuvers,car moans and groans. "
pontiac,torrent,2007,cubldr, 10/29/2009,lot of SUV for the money,4,"I am tall and so are my kids and you gotta LOVE the rear legroom! Unbelievable. I was amazed at how much room this thing has. I share everyones frustration with ergonomics of front window controls, front seat adjuster, cupholders, but these are minor irritants.  Had to have some warranty work done to correct some noisy valve operation in the engine but this is covered under the extended drivetrain warranty that comes with the vehicle.  I sold GM vehicles in 2002-2003 with this same engine. I have MOST pleased with the 18-19 mpg my wife gets running the kids all over town everyday. Also much peppier in this configuration than Buick Rendezvous or GM minivans with this engine.  "
pontiac,torrent,2007,Frank Weir, 07/31/2010,Not a great Vechile,2,Bought it used last year. First rain storm found out how poor it handles in the rain. Traction control is scary when it comes on. It came with four good snow tires but is total useless in the snow. When on ling trip this summer and had reasonable trip except when it rained. Found that the spare tire compartment fills with water when it rains. Lost right side from stereo and the turn signal has no sound. First and last GM product.
pontiac,torrent,2007,Teresa, 06/20/2008,2007 torrent,3,"I love the look of the Pontiac Torrent very roomy for a smaller suv. I have had my torrent in the shop at least 8 times for ignition problems. The key will not turn. It's like in a lock position and all they would do is spray and lube the ignition. At 30,000 miles now my rotors are warped and they say they just do that sometimes.  They just replaced the ignition cylinder hoping this fixes the problem!"
pontiac,torrent,2007,Janet Pierson, 04/11/2009,Great vehicle,4,"Did lots of research before purchasing and after the test drive, I was sold. It has met my expectations. NO mechanical problems and took 2 week road trip and it was very comfortable. I planned on keeping this vehicle for many years, due to it's nice performance, handling and storage room.  It has a 5 star crash rating and unfortunately I recently was involved in a serious collision with airbag deployment. I walked away from the car without a scratch or bruise! I will be looking for another Torrent to replace this one."
pontiac,torrent,2007,BtCaptiva, 02/26/2008,Long Time Toyota Owner/Purchaser,4,"I am truly impressed with this vehicle. Styling is ""eye catching"" and performance with the 184 HP engine is remarkably strong, handling is much like a sports car feel.  Highway is a smooth ride.  Instrumentation is easily viewed and accessible. There is plenty of room for driver and passengers. The back seat adusts as well which is unique.  As a mid-size it is comparable to other, more expensive makes, as far as hauling capacity.  The sound system is wonderful.  During hot summer months the A/C cools quickly.  I looked at other makes comparable in size priced in the $30,000's that I would normally purchase but for the money I choice this Torrent and have been pleased.  Time will tell.    "
pontiac,torrent,2007,janson, 05/30/2007,Torrent Love,4,"Love the size. Bigger then the competition, but not huge, and doesn't feel big while driving. It can actually fit in parking spots, but still has tons of leg room in the rear. Plenty of engine for what it supposed to do, and lots of features to keep the driver informed."
pontiac,torrent,2007,Pontiac Tradition, 10/07/2006,GM can still do it!,4,"Good looks and excellent performance. I am impressed with quiet cabin and good ride. Back seat leg room is exceptional. Features versus price is way above what I expected. Seats are very compfortable, be sure to opt for the preferred package. Engine performance is better than expected and the 5 speed trany is great.   "
pontiac,torrent,2007,Sandra Opsal, 06/06/2010,A Few Problems!,4,"I've had my Torrent for 3+ years and its been fairly reliable until recently.  Had a problem with stabilitrac and traction control lights coming on, they had to replace a valve (don't have paperwork in front of me).  Just returned from a 500 mile road trip and stabilitrac light just came on again.  Also car sounds like a plane ready for take off - transmission?  Will be bringing that to dealership tomorrow.  No extended warranty.  Hope the powertrain warranty covers it.  Have 48,000 miles on it and this could be the first serious problem I've had with it.  Otherwise, have enjoyed driving it.  Wish mileage were better but it is good on long trips and better in summer (21-22) than winter (19)."
pontiac,torrent,2007,Vincent Smith, 10/23/2008,Very Dissappointed Torrent Owner,3,I bought this vehicle because I fell in love with the style.  I have had nothing but problems with it since day one.  I must have got a real lemon.  I am now involved with GM Head Office.  The file folder I have on this vehicle is to big to mention.  Everything has gone on it but the Dealership in my hometown of Orillia never seems to be able to agree with my findings of course.  Hoping to trade it in soon.  The unfortunate part is I love the vehicle so much I am considering taking another Torrent for a test drive.  I hope they are not all of the same quality.  
pontiac,torrent,2007,Scotsman, 05/20/2009,Good buy,4,"only downer is I don't like window controls on center console.  Otherwise, this is a really good vehicle.  I would buy another one"
pontiac,torrent,2007,Joe, 03/17/2017,Poor Distance of 195 Feet on the remote start FOB.,3,"I just bought this vehicle so my review is mostly about the remote start distance. I wish I could upgrade this remote to get more distance, but I was told I needed to purchase a new remote starter to maybe even get 2000 feet remote starter distance or better. I did however put in a call to GM dealer for more information on upgrading the remote starter.

I recently traded this vehicle in and purchased a newer vehicle.

pontiac,torrent,2007,Mark C, 09/14/2008,Nice CUV,5,"We have had this vehicle for almost a year now and have not had a problem with it. It drives very smooth, very appealing exterior which is hard to find right now."
pontiac,torrent,2007,Heidi, 12/26/2007,2007 AWD Pontiac Torrent,4,We really like our Pontiac Torrent.  The exterior and interior are very well designed.  I miss having a light by the vanity mirror.  We love the leg room in the back seat.  It's very reliable for us and comfortable for our entire family.
pontiac,torrent,2007,Joan, 01/26/2008,Poor interior design - don't recommend,3,"The performance of the Torrent has been wonderful.  Was tail-ended, everyone safe, and the cost of repair was very reasonable because the rear bumper is in a couple of different parts.  If the whole thing had been one piece, it would have been higher. The interior design is sorely lacking.  If the cup holders are in use, the parking brake cannot be.  You have to remove drinks from the holders to put on the parking brake as well as use the cigarette lighter for recharing cell phone. When putting on the parking brake by habit and there are drinks in the holders, the drinks spill or the holder is in danger of being broken.  P Drives wonderfully.  Fun.  Even 17 year old son likes to drive it. "
pontiac,torrent,2007,warren waters, 03/25/2007,warren,5,"the car drives well, handles the road bumps well, steering feels a little touchy. very quiet ride.a lot of room inside for people and cargo"
pontiac,torrent,2007,Dave, 04/28/2007,Better than expected,4,The quality of the 2007 Torrent has surprised me. Very quiet with great room and ample performance. No rattles or squeaks! This is an SUV you need to consider before you buy an import. 
pontiac,torrent,2007,Mark, 04/19/2007,2007 Torrent,4,"Seating comfort was the biggest factor in my choosing the Torrent, but it is fun to drive and I've been impressed by the fuel economy. I like the exterior styling better than the Jeep or Mariner or even the Torrent's twin the Chevy Equinox. The front grille looks like the twin-kindey of a BMW X3, and I like that."
pontiac,torrent,2007,Mike in Portland, 04/30/2007,A lot of car for the money,5,"The Torrent was a great choice for a guy like me who needed to move to a larger car from a sedan due to a new baby, but doesnt want to move to a huge SUV. Not only is the Torrents size just right, but it looks cool, it drives very well, and it has great leg room in both the front and rear seats. The V-6 engine really goes when you need it to. The car handles corners better than our 02 Corolla did.  The gas mileage is acceptable for a car this size. The 3500lb towing capacity is enough for all of our needs. If you are looking for value and options, a loaded Torrent can be had for under $30K. I chose the Torrent afer considering the Rav4, CR-V, Trailblazer, and HHR.  "
pontiac,torrent,2007,Terry, 05/15/2007,After 6 months it still seems a good choice,4,Got a red one in Dec 2006. Looked at the Jeep Grand Cherokee Ltd which is what I had before but wanted something a little less to go along with my new retired lifestyle. Looked at others but nothing clicked until I drove the Torrent. Its towing cap. (3500 lb.) is more than adequate for my use and the back opens up to be fairly flat and roomy.  It is fairly quick but no flash -- but then my other car is a Bonneville SSEi (turbo).  It handles well and corners well -- it feels agile.  My wife does not think the seats are that comfortable -- I think they are OK but could be better.  I think it will serve its purpose well.
pontiac,torrent,2007,ForeignAffairz, 06/25/2007,Perfect Crossover,5,"I traded my '97 Firebird for a more practical vehicle. If you want sharp looks with functionality, this is the car for you. The mesh inside the Torrent is a lot smoother than its counterpart.  Another reason I bought the Torrent is to tow my 15' Boston Whaler. The hitch is a stage 3(heavy duty) and it pulls the boat with ease, especially in low gear.  I love it and so does my girl. I love it."
pontiac,torrent,2007,Road Trip Warrior, 07/02/2007,Poor Man's BMW,4,"Looking for a fun vehicle that is very good on gas economy and has a lot of bells and whistles for the money? The Torrent has a responsive feel and very good handling for a crossover type car. Although the horsepower could be slightly higher to create better response, there is plenty of pickup to nudge your way into highway merges. Extensive leg room and flat floor space makes for better comfort than our previous Envoy in the back seat area. Fully equipped with everything but the navigator, my wife seems to marvel at the remote start and sunroof features which add more enjoyment. Better feel than the Equinox, easy to drive, the Torrent makes for a great alternative to pricier crossovers."
pontiac,torrent,2007,torrent owner, 08/23/2007,Torrent Value,3,"The Torrent/Equinox is nothing special, but it does lots of things well and doesnt cost a fortune. It is very safe, one of only two cars getting 5 stars with-out side airbags! Get the SAB option anyway!  It is very roomy, opened up it holds more than many SUVs much larger, and it holds more than all other mid and small SUVs.  This is because the rear is still squarish, so it really opens up.  The mileage is good for an AWD, I regularly get 22 to 24 in real driving.  But like all Torrent/NOX owners I wish it had a little more pep. The 08 has more engine options.  Major complaint is the lack of a good arm rest for my left arm on the door, or a telescopic steering wheel. "
pontiac,torrent,2007,Tony, 09/18/2007,Nice one from Pontiac,4,"I was very suprised when I took the Torrent for a test drive. On the test drive, I was totally convinced that this vehicle was for me. I totally agree with the one review about it being the poor mans BMW. It feels like a very expensive vehicle, but it doesnt have the price tag of one. I am proud of my Pontiac Torrent!!!"
pontiac,torrent,2007,Whitsinn, 06/14/2007,Love This Vehicle!,4,"Absolutely love the Pontiac Torrent. We were looking to get out of our minivan, and this little SUV was a great choice. Love the style. We have 3 kids and there is plenty of room in the back seat. Lots of leg room. Handles well. Very stylish!"
pontiac,torrent,2007,rsmith, 06/20/2007,Best Vehicle I Have Owned!,4,"I love my Torrent. It has a lot of leg room, the fuel economy is quit good, the styling is great. The suspension is good. All around a great SUV! The cup holders have not been an issue for me."
pontiac,torrent,2007,Live Free or Die, 07/23/2007,Nice vehicle,4,"We went from a 1999 Ford Windstar. I considered myself a Ford person (after owning 6). We looked at the Honda CR- V, Chevy Equinox and the Pontiac Torrent.  We decided to stay in the GM family so that knocked out the Honda (it also seemed a little small for our use).  The Pontiac had better option packages and the one we wanted was readily available at the dealer.  After driving it for a few months my observations are as follows: The styling is great, it does look like higher end vehicles, the pick up is slow but once you hit it, it takes off. Wouldn't recommend the cargo upgrade as it actually cuts into the space."
pontiac,torrent,2007,David H. Hagen, 09/21/2007,"Style, efficiency & reliability",5,"I've upgraded to the 2007 Torrent from the 2004 Aztek - wow!  My Aztek was very reliable but Pontiac raised the bar even more with the Torrent.  Style, class and efficiency are very common with Pontiac and the Torrent is no exception. I have the ""Preferred"" and ""Sun and Sound"" packages which make my Torrent feel worth double the money!  The Torrent also handles wonderfully and is very fun to drive.  Kudos Pontiac - the Torrent is a wonderful vehicle!"
pontiac,torrent,2007,Mark D, 10/23/2007,Like the Torrent,4,"I owned a Dodge Caravan for 12 years and wanted something smaller but still roomy. I'm about 6' tall so I like the leg room & headroom of SUV's. I test drove a Mariner, too, but chose the Torrent. It's more comfortable because it's wider and the seats are very cushiony."
pontiac,torrent,2007,Adam, 11/27/2007,Sporty Look Family Vehicle,5,"The car drives great and has better fuel economy then I expected.  I think the biggest surprise was the leg room in the back seat, all of our passengers said they were very comfortable riding in the back.  "
pontiac,torrent,2007,gm4life, 04/20/2008,A great small SUV!,4,"I have been looking for a small SUV since 2005. I have looked on and off but in 2006 when I saw the Torrent I knew I had to have one. I test drove the Rav and CRV and the Torrent left the best impression on me. It had the feel of a sporty Pontiac. The Torrent has decent giddy-up not as much as my 2005 Bonneville SLE but still enough. The back-seat slides forward and back to adjust for cargo room or leg room. I have been very happy with its balance of function and performance. In a crowded segment the Torrent stands out, and frankly there is not a better small SUV out there for the money. I am enjoying this little thing a lot and it is perfect for a family the likes to travel. "
pontiac,torrent,2007,Carlos, 05/02/2008,Awesome SUV,5,"Like many of you, I was doing some research last year trying to buy a comfortable, spacious and low price SUV. In conclusion the Torrent beat all the other suv I researched (Patriot,compass, Escape, Mercury). You get more of what you pay for. I bought the Bugg shield, window visor and mud guard. Wish it make it look cooler. Gas Mileage is decent compared to other cars or SUVs, can't complain. "
pontiac,torrent,2007,Dazz, 05/14/2008,A Home Run for Our Family,5,"The Torrent has been a hit for my wife and me.  We have pack it to the top and traveled with it.  The rear seats and front passenger seat fold flat which allows a lot more storage.  I consistently get 20-21 mpg and have gotten 26 when going 60 mph.  Overall, my wife and I lover our Torrent!"
pontiac,torrent,2007,George, 05/23/2008,Car Great. Oil usage very bad.,3,"My 2007 Torrent has 13,000 miles on it.  It has been carefully driven and dealer serviced.  It uses 1 qt. of oil every 2000 miles.  GM says this is normal for all of their cars and trucks and refuses to fix it.  Dealer says they've not seen this before but refuses to help.  GM's Regional Manager refuses to contact me so I can discuss this with GM.  This defect and GM's refusal to honor their warranty has ruined our experience with an otherwise excellent vehicle.  I strongly suggest you not buy a GM vehicle."
pontiac,torrent,2008,Michigan Driver, 03/03/2016,Good Solid Ride (Whip),4,"I bought my Torrent used with around 90,000 miles. After a few months I started to have engine power problems transmission problems, losing power, running rough. I also had problems with the stabilitrac and antilock brakes. I went to the dealership and they had no answers or ideas on what the problem was. I did some research and a domino effect of thing were improved by a new egr valve as well as plugs and wires. I did all repairs myself to save hundreds. All the problems went away and I've put 10's of thousands of miles on it with no more issues.

pontiac,torrent,2008,czuchster, 09/24/2010,Knew What I Was Getting,4,"There are some squeaks here and there, especially with the steering wheel, but I read the reviews before I bought the car and I knew what to expect. The only disappointment has been with the gas mileage, which hasn't quite been up to the EPA estimates. Even my Hondaphile and Toyotaphile friends have been impressed with the comfort and looks of my Torrent. On the safety front, I was in an accident three months ago that sent two other drivers to the hospital but I didn't get a scratch, or even feel sore the next day. I can't rave enough. I've looked at trading it in for something with better MPG, but I can't find anything I'd give up for Torrent for."
pontiac,torrent,2008,tk6227, 07/11/2014,Don't Buy,1,"I purchased by Pontiac Torrent in 2011 each year i have had problems.
Within the first year the radio went out and the repair is $400. The next year my transmission went out $1500.
The next year - when it rains the floors in my back seat get wet and causes and odor.
Now i am seeing all these recalls for all these things that are wrong with the car.
I called GM and the Dealership on several occassions and they just don't care. i am too far under to even get out of the car into something more reliable."
pontiac,torrent,2008,JRagan, 11/19/2008,Love my Torrent GXP,4,I bought my '08 Torrent GXP about a month ago. It is Carbon Black. Mine came fully loaded with DVD entertainment system which included a pair of Panasonic wireless headphones. It also has OnStar and XM raidio. The sound system sounds great and movies really rock coming out of the cars speakers. The wireless headphones sound great and are much much better than I thought they would be. I really like how the 60/40 rear seat can slide almost 8 in. I must say the GXP's 264 hp engine really delivers.It gives you plenty of get up and go and lots of power to tow. I drove mine through the Rocky Mtns towing over 3000 lbs and had no problem on the very steep grades. This is my first SUV and I love it.
pontiac,torrent,2008,lvetzal, 03/08/2010,loved it,5,This by far was my favorite car I have owned.  I too was recently in a serious collision on a busy highway and walked away without a scratch only because of the vehicle I was driving. It had tons of room handled like a dream and gas wasn't so bad either! The only problem I had was the front wheel bearings went in my first 6 months of owning.  But were replaced by my warranty no problem. I would highly recommend this vehicle.
pontiac,torrent,2008,randy394, 12/31/2014,Loved Until Recently,3,"Bought my 08 Torrent GXP in 2011 and, up until recently, I have loved it. However, Ive now had the power steering hose break three times and Im growing tired of repeatedly fixing it. My battery also died at only 44,000 miles and the all-wheel drive regularly goes out when the temperature dips below zero, which is the type of weather when you mostly need AWD. I love the comfort, look, features, and how the Torrent drives, but Im now looking at a new car as Im sick of these mounting piddly issues. I never once had my 04 Malibu 2LT in the shop beyond oil changes in the 7 years, 80K+ miles I owned it. "
pontiac,torrent,2008,Eric Godat, 04/28/2009,Great first SUV,4," Just  read the news about Pontiac perhaps  going good bye. Sad but this Pontiac Torrent is a rock solid performer and for good value. It is said GM always stops building a car when they got it right.  I echo most of the comments above. This is a fun to drive vehicle and handles  well for the 3.4L Minor gripes: the cupholder window control, Perhaps a luggage rack bar on top as standard.  Back  seat room is far superior to all other  midsize SUVs.  The only problem? My  20 year old daughter  now ""claims"" it as her primary driving vehicle! But such is life when you teach children how to help pick a car( she picked it). But I have fun on my commute motorcycle"
pontiac,torrent,2008,Mikey, 04/02/2009,Like it so much bought a 2nd one,4,"Actually owned it's cousin the Chevrolet Equinox for 4 years.  I love that car.  So much so I added a Torrent to the stable.  The Equinox and Torrent are fun to drive and I have had zero problems.  A little over 20 in the city and 24-26 on the highway MPG.  The moving Rear seat is my favorite feature, but the performance of the engine and transmission is as good as the Mercedes I once owned."
pontiac,torrent,2008,Persy , 01/19/2010,Would recommend,4,"Bought in Pittsburgh in Feb 2008.  Has handled very well in snow and rain!  Doesn't have a lot of horsepower - but, that keeps the MPG lower.  Some of the inside features are breaking (mirror covers).  But, overall a very reliable car, and I drive a LOT. "
pontiac,torrent,2008,Brad, 01/07/2008,Highly recommend GXP,4,This is one fast little SUV. The six speed auto tranny helps with fuel enconomy while not hurting performance. The manual mode of the transmission has about a 1 second lag between the time you shift up or down to the time it actually does it. Seats are very comfortable over a long trip.  
pontiac,torrent,2008,Snappy, 07/21/2009,best for the money,4,"I have been a sedan or coupe driver all my life, I also build and drive street rods, but this torrent is the most fun vehicle I have ever owned. I always am looking for an excuse to go somewhere. I have looked at other vehicles and it seems to me that this car offers a lot more goodies for the money."
pontiac,torrent,2008,jackay_boy, 10/14/2011,WOW What else can I say ?,4,"I have had this vehicle for several month's now, and look for reasons to take it out and play. All of the ponies under the hood are married perfectly with the 6 speed tranny. I think this 3.6 really puts out like Pontiac said it would. Hope I get to keep my license for as long as I own this beauty, which I have the feeling will be a long time."
pontiac,torrent,2008,joslin3, 11/27/2013,Don't buy,2,"Absolutely horrible and because you now must deal with GM they don't want to recall these vehicles because that would cause them to fix a problem that Pontiac created.I have owned one for almost 2 years and I have had nothing but problems,within a month of owning it the radio didn't work, the lock on the drivers door costs 300 to fix because unless you actually try to open it while it is locked you would of never known it doesn't lock, the rear windshield wiper motor went, the wheel bearings are 300 a piece, and because of how they are made it is common for rocks and sticks to get into the cv shaft and cause 200 in damage.Stabilitrak & ABS light constantly on & off."
pontiac,torrent,2008,Tommy Torrent, 11/25/2007,Owning a 2008 Torrent,4,"This vehicle is fun to drive for my wife, much easier than our previous '03 Explorer. Great ride. The only complaint is the short turning radius."

pontiac,torrent,2008,Joey, 09/02/2008,I'm in love,5,"I just brought this baby home and I'm smitten.  I test drove several SUVs over Labor Day weekend (the 2008s were priced to move).  I didn't even know that Pontiac had a crossover (I was familiar with the Equinox, which is the same vehicle).  I was about to pull the Trigger on a Santa Fe, which actually had a nicer interior with more storage, but once I test drove the Pontiac, I was sold.  The 3.4 L pulls that rig right up to speed with no problem, and the handling was tight like a sports sedan.  Compared to the Santa Fe and the Escape, the Torrent won on performance alone (and good looks).  Also, I averaged 26 MPG on the 120 mile freeway drive home.  Not bad for a big vehicle like this."
pontiac,torrent,2008,torrent, 02/25/2009,"Love the car, hate the cup holders!",5,"Love the car. Getting in and out is great, the interior is very roomy. Hate the cup holders. I dropped my keys in the open space and it took me an hour to get them out between the seat and the open space. Wish I knew something I could get to replace the cup holders. "
pontiac,torrent,2008,Fran, 08/05/2008,Don't miss out on a great bargain,5,"The Torrent is a great little SUV for women.  Enough space to carry just about anything, but handles like a compact, that fabulous Pontiac power steering and transmission.  Pontiac is the true signature American car; sharp style at first glance, muscle when you need it, smooth ride, fun and always dependable.  I have done weekend driving with the Murano and the Jeep Liberty and the Torrent beats both no contest.  It has all the classic benefits of a Pontiac:  fast start, stylish interior and exterior, affordable price (at $26,000 it is $12,000 cheaper than the Murano) and great on gas.  I get 27 miles to the gallon, and it only takes $61.00 to fill up the tank.  I love this car."
pontiac,torrent,2008,Rob L. , 10/04/2008,Comfortable Cross Over,3,"This is a very good riding cross over type SUV.  It gets very good gas mileage on the highway - about 25 to 26.  The controls are pretty good, but the steering and handling on the base model is unacceptably sloppy. If you like this vehicle, get the GXP model which has a different and tighter steering system. The center console could be a lot better and more useful - it lacks storage and the center mounted power window buttons are not intuitive. "
pontiac,torrent,2008,Carol, 11/19/2008,Love This Car,4,"Love how this handles-what a difference between the Torrent and my Jeep. Lot of room, comfortable and smooth ride. For the price you can not beat it."
pontiac,torrent,2008,Ryan, 01/20/2009,Great looking SUV,4,"I would recommend this vehicle to anyone who is thinking about getting an SUV. This is my first SUV and I love the look and comfort of it. XM radio in the vehicle is a great feature that I can't believe I lived with out before. This is a very roomy vehicle, yet still very sporty looking."
pontiac,torrent,2008,SUV love it, 09/07/2009,Great SUV for the price,4,Great SUV for the price.  Love the features and the ride.  MPG is combined about 22.  Not bad for a SUV of this size with a V6 engine.
pontiac,torrent,2008,Gail Oldow, 02/03/2008,Strong enough for a man but made for me,4,"My husband went on and on about seeing this beautiful vehicle, so we went to test drive it. As soon as I got in and adjusted the seats and realized that I would never again need a pillow to get close enough to the steering wheel, I was in love. And then to top things off,I finally had a place to store my huge purse; the center console lifts up to hold a purse or anything else. And then you can fold the center back down again. For a woman who pays a lot of money for purses, I never have to throw it on the floor, or the back seat, I can have it next to me but neatly stored. Someone was really thinking there. Thank you!"
pontiac,torrent,2008,Walter Conrad, 02/19/2008,The best crossover vehicle I've owned,5,"This will be the third crossover vehicle I have owned the other 2 being Subaru Outbacks a 1997 and a 2002. The Pontiac has it all over them. More power, more room, better styling, better fuel economy all with a lower price tag. The interior on the Pontiac Torrent is very roomy, comfortable and well laid out. Cargo space is huge and versitile because of the sliding rear seat. Fit and finish is outstanding both inside and out. Power from the standard 3.4L V6 is impressive and the 5 speed automatic transmission is smooth shifting and the rest of the drivetrain is also smooth and quiet. Handling, braking and ride quality are top notch as good as I have experienced in vehicles costing much more."
pontiac,torrent,2008,Bill, 02/27/2008,Bill's Torrent,4,I previously owned a 1998 Old's Bravada and a 2007 Mazda CX9.  All of my vehicles have their pluses and minues but I really like the Torrent. The biggest problem I have is with is with the interior design on the Torrent. The cup holders are virtually worthless to use. The stereo system is excellent. The handling affects out on the road are very good - just hope the gas mileage gets better. 
pontiac,torrent,2008,Tim S., 02/29/2008,I love this car/crossover whatever,4,"So nice, so tight. Moves as one unit. No squeeks, no rattle,  just solid build. Quiet, with a nice tech sound to the engine. Everything high technology. Seats firm and fitting. Sit high and command a view of the road. About 26 mpg on the road at 65. 55 gets you 28"
pontiac,torrent,2008,gr, 12/04/2007,Surprisingly good,5,Outstanding space utilization. Back seat is exceptionally roomy. Flat floor. Great fold down rear seat operation. Folds flat with one hand and misses front seats with room to spare. Relatively light (3800 lbs.) for an SUV with this much room. Tows well with 2500 lb. U haul. Rich exterior appearance (silver with 17 inch wheels). Satisfied with build quality.
pontiac,torrent,2008,ACE, 05/04/2008,GXP Sleeper,4,"Every Torrent owner I have talked to really likes their vehicle.  This GXP is really fast and handles like a sports car.  It is so neutral in the corners. When you  expect the front end to push, it just digs in & goes round.  I am at over 22 mpg now.  It has great utility to boot.  If you are looking for a vehicle like this, you really owe it to yourself to give it a try.  I know of Honda owners who don't get but a 1mpg more in their smaller CR-V and no fun factor at all.  Even Scions only get about 23.5 & are slower than molasses. "

Had it a year now and its been a huge headache. December I put a transmission in it that cost me $3000 dollars being AWD. Had some hiccups for a short time after with check engine lights and ended up changing the battery and all was good till now. Took it to the dealership about a month ago and with a crank sensor being bad.... now all kinds of issues are coming up and the dealership has officially given up on it with no explanation. JUNK!!!!!

This SUV is fun to drive, has enough horsepower to carry 4 good size (and then some) people without dragging its feet, and handles very well. Even though it has lots of room inside, it's not a huge land barge like the Escalade. My friend bought a Ford Explorer and his 15 mpg is killing him. I've always had good luck with Pontiacs, and this looks like another winner."

I pulled my boat 500 miles with no problem and the mileage is about 20% better than the Envoy.  The Torrent is fun to drive, don't believe the reviews about it being ""mushy"" etc. The 3.4 V6 has plenty of spunk.  The vehicle performs very well in town and on the highway.  Highway mileage is about 25 and city is about 18.  Plenty of room inside for 4 adults for long distance and 5 adults is not problem for shorter drives, rear seating has amazing leg room and front seat passenger seat has more room than the Envoy.  We added the chrome package and leather."

pontiac,torrent,2008,Strandedmom, 10/08/2020,Pontiac paperweight.,2,"If you're looking for a car that needs a new motor after 240k, then this one's for you! 
But don't think that a new motor will do you any good. If anything, you'll just be wasting thousands of $$ for a heap of junk that will leave you dead in the middle of an intersection. 

I had my motor replaced at 240,000km because it just died one morning and never started again. 
The motor that was put in ($3,700) had under 100,000km, and lasted me 6 months before it died on me in the middle of a highway intersection. 
The check engine light came on, the car DIED, and all of the lights started flashing: service stabilitrak, low oil, no engine power, no fuel, no abs. 
If you can think it, the warning sign came up for it. 
Codes showed up for Throttle Position Sensor, Knock Sensors, Crank Position Sensor
We towed it home, replaced all of the sensors and a whole new Throttle Body. 
Drove the car for half an hour, and it died again. Not accelerating, not driving, and throwing all of the codes for the sensors we JUST REPLACED. 
The car would turn back on, but wouldn't drive for more than a few feet before dying again.
I have no more savings to get this car back up and running and no local shops have a clue in hell what could be wrong with it. 
I have 2 young children who can't get to school now. I've been without a vehicle for 5 weeks and I have no options. 
Awesome.
I don't understand why there isn't a recall on this vehicle - the amount of people who seem to have experience the same issues is almost comical.

pontiac,torrent,2009,Vic, 10/27/2015,"Great, reliable car/SUV.",5,"Sold it. (But loved it and miss it!)

Super dependable with a decent ride and nice acceleration. Plenty of room for 5 and lots of cargo space. Rides more like a truck with a stiffer ride. This SUV is very flexible and dependable. It's a great family car, yet can also carry large loads (i.e., equipment, tools, lumber, etc). Have thought about trading it in but its just such a nice utilitarian vehicle that I hate to part with it.

Update: Sold the car in January this year (01/2016). It was still in excellent condition, no mechanical issues, no rust, decent (but stiff) ride. Wanted something with a smoother ride for trips around the country. Sold it for $8000 which I felt was pretty good for a 7 year old vehicle. Have been a regular Pontiac owner (Grand Am, G6, Montana, Torrent) and am sooooo disappointed they went out of business.

pontiac,torrent,2009,mollyd, 09/22/2010,Driving it until it dies.,4,"Originally owned a 2007, traded in for a 2009 AWD when I heard they were stopping the line.  I literally walked on the lot, said how much and then started negotiating.  This one rides smoother than the 2007.  I'm 5 feet tall and not only do I feel safer in an SUV, this one isn't so wide that I feel like I'm driving a bus. The AWD really gets me around in almost impassable snow.  We had 13 inches and I didn't have a problem.  I really love this car, mechanically I have not had a single problem at 30k+.  My biggest challenge is where the front end ends, I always have about 12 inches of freedom I don't know about.  Plus, parallel parking isn't tough unless it's a tiny spot. Fuel econ 17/21."
pontiac,torrent,2009,David, 06/16/2016,2009 Pontiac Torrent 3.4L V6 AWDI have had a Ponti,4,"I have had a 2009 Pontiac Torrent AWD 3.4 L V6 since 2010. I get 25-28 MPG highway at 60 mph. I live in the country so for city driving I have less data. Going up steep hills hill MPG can drop to 15 MPG. Minimum MPG is 23-24 with no city driving and various driving terrain. Vehicle has 185,000 miles and gets the same good MPG as new. Car has had a new throttle body, new front transaxle, new timing chain, two new intake manifold pressure sensors, new ERG, new battery, and all fluids, plugs, and filters  changed at recommended times or more often. Brakes are original and will go to ~210,000 miles. The problems I have seen with the car are a lot to front transaxle wear and rear differential wear. I have had to change those lubricants more than recommended. Also had some automatic transmission shifting issues. The transmission seemed not to be able to make up its mind. The dealership said it was OK on test drive so I fixed it myself by installing new intake manifold pressure sensor (first sensor went bad in 2 months so it took another one before problem was solved). I relayed the info to the dealership and they agreed that was the problem. Vehicle drives great in snow and ice, it has all options; Stabilitrac and traction control. Road noise is high.

Let up on the gas and it comes to a stop, I mean motor runs but I mean the power just dogs, it's like all power stops going to the drive train? I guess it saves on brakes. It has a horrible turning ratio, didn't notice it on test drive, you need to plan ahead to park. The CD player takes forever to load. If I'd known the gas mileage was going to be this bad, I would've bought a truck or a SUV with 4x4."

pontiac,vibe,2003,Pravin Shah, 12/14/2016,Swiss Army Car,5,"Big enough for my sons to sit in the back. Great cargo room. Handles excellent, fast, good visibility. I take it winter camping with its 9 inch ground clearance.

Replaced water pump clutch and starter. That's it. Engine starts on first key turn even at -10f. Runs like a top...best engine I ever had in a car. I'll NEVER find one this fast, this economical and this utilitarian, even to the roof rack. Just a fantastic car.

(Update June 2018) 276,000 mi. Runs so strong it's uncanny. I haved used valvoline full synthetic for 225,000 mi, and it runs like it did 15 years ago. This winter it sat outside in -5f for three weeks, started on first turn in 5 seconds. 

(Update Jan 2019) 290,000 mi. Runs great, engine sounds eager and ready and just broken in. Great GREAT car. And fast as bejeezus for a little old beer can.
Love this vehicle. Tent on its hatch, 9 inch ground clearance... it's camping season.

(Jan 2020) Drove width of U.S. a couple times in 2019... Wisconsin to Niagara Falls via Ontario, to Wisconsin, 
- to Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, Wash State, to Wisconsin, 
- to Colorado, to Wisconsin. 
Drove Glacier Park, Yellowstone, Tetons, Rocky Mt Park... and took it up to 14000 feet on Mt Evans. Slept in it, camped in it, drove 4x4 mountain roads in The Grand Tetons.
310,000 miles on car so far. It won't die.

Never had any problems with mine.  Changed the tires, brakes, and oil and that's all.  Had a speaker go bad in the passenger side front door that was replaced under warranty.

We drive mostly highway miles and enjoyed 30 MPG but got 33 MPG on a recent trip to Ohio. Due to the 6 speed manual transmission and being extremely well maintained. You would be Amazed at what you can haul when the back seats are laidd down flat since the back cargo capacity is Huge! Sister car to the Toyota Matrix at a fraction of the price.

Only routine maintenance and I drive the poor thing down what seems like some of the worst ""paved"" roads that New England has to offer. Amazingly reliable, no problems whatsoever. My favorite part is that I average 30mpg.  It's an awesome little car that's bigger on the inside than it looks. Its exterior is also much more stylish than that of its sister car, the Toyota Matrix. It's fun to drive, has a great turning radius, and easy maneuverability. If I had to complain, I'd say the dashboard isn't my favorite set-up (it's sectioned off), it can be a little noisy at higher speeds, and the acceleration can lag a bit. But honestly, that was a tough list to come up with. The only reason I won't have it soon is because I'm giving it to my sister so that she can I have a car. I wish they still made them, I'd buy another in a heartbeat. I love this car!

Bricks and pavers, stones for building a retaining wall, bales of peat moss or bags of mulch, scrubs and flowers galore, a wheelbarrow and all my garden tools - I've loaded it all into this car without worry.

pontiac,vibe,2003,rbarrit, 07/18/2002,Vibe GT is great,4,"Really love my Vibe GT.  Its quiet on 
the highway (in 6th gear), sporty growl 
under moderate acceleration, and a nice 
scream under heavy.  You'll have to 
love reving the engine for decent 
acceleration.  Fuel 39 mpg (imperial, 
32 mpg US).

One thing to keep in mind about the 
engine is that its torque curve is 
fairly flat.  This means that HP is 
directly proportional to revs, and you 
need to rev the engine to get the 
power.  Do not expect to use engine 
torque in high gears to get forceful 
acceleration.

Handling is great (17"" 50 series summer 
tires).

I just love the Vibe GT!"

said it was common in new vehicles, but 
at 19,000 miles, it should have cleared 
up.  I took it to the dealer for the 
next oil change, so I could mention the 
potential problem.  The transmission 
fluid again had lots of metal in it. 
They ""strongly suggested"" a fluid flush

I've had an issue with the headlights mysteriously turning on when the car sits overnight in temperatures near or below freezing, resulting in a dead battery the next morning. No mechanical problems. Fuel mileage is excellent with 1.8L engine.  I get about 31-32mpg in mostly city driving. Of course the downside is that acceleration with this engine is anemic."
pontiac,vibe,2003,can't complain, 04/06/2009,"If it was a lesser car, I'd be dead.",4,"I was recently hit by someone who ran a stop sign; t-boned the car, and it was slammed tail first into an electric pole. We walked away from the car with soft tissue damage; if it'd been a lesser car, we would have been badly hurt. No side air bags--I LOVED my car. Filled up each Sunday, got me around for the week with 40 miles a day average, with manual transmission. Had a problem with the gas tank, but it was just an annoyance. Car was NEVER a headache. After 6 years, it still had a beautiful exterior, paint held up well. Seats stain a little too easily, imo. Drove well, only had to replace the clutch, NEVER had any serious engine problems. FUN TO DRIVE, just check my mileage, lol!"
pontiac,vibe,2003,beckys56 , 04/21/2009,GrannyVibes,4,"I have had no problems with the vibe. It gets great gas mileage on hwy 35- 36,in town average 29. Lots of room for my camping equipment and grandkids. Got a lewis and clark bag for the top when in travel mode, works great saves room in vehicle for other things. Do wish I had cruise control. Would suggest for people to purchase a vibe. Not really liking the new design, but as long as they didn't chg the mileage I could handle the new design. I have drove 70000 miles in 6yrs, I would drive my vibe any where if need be, handles great, even in snow. Change oil 3000 miles or 3mths,tires 1x a year and yearly check ups."
pontiac,vibe,2003,Jay Brad, 05/11/2009,"Not sexy, but dependable",4,"We bought our Vibe with 36,000 miles and are now at 96,000 miles. The only repair was on the alternator at 90,000 miles. Outside of that it has just been oil changes and brake pads.  This is a great car! The only thing it lacks is a cool factor. However, we drive a ton and the whole family enjoys the ride."
pontiac,vibe,2003,drfriede, 06/25/2002,Pretty Cool Ride,4,"Was considering the Vibe and Matrix, 
went with the Vibe because it is a 
better looking car.  So far, it is 
pretty fun to drive, only complaint so 
far is the dashboard gauges are hard to 
read when the sun is behind you, and 
the trunk area needs something like a 
net or some device to keep stuff from 
moving."
pontiac,vibe,2003,berne1, 08/08/2002,Hot Hatch,4,"I took the GT model.  Thought this car 
was SOOO much fun!  I love the 
versatility of the hatchback/wagon type 
of car (and yes, I'm comfortable with 
calling it a wagon!).  The placement of 
the shifter couldn't be better.  
Surprisingly quiet on the expressway 
and fun to flog around town!  The power 
is all from 6000-8000 RPM, which means 
you don't always get into it in daily 
driving.  Ideally, I'd have the base 
w/5-speed and the GT suspension."
pontiac,vibe,2003,encanto, 09/04/2002,Poor gauge visibility,3,"I reccomend it but--
The gauges are difficult to see in daylight particularly if you are using 
sunglasses and driving into the sun. This problem is aggravated if you 
ordinarily wear bi-focals and are using single vision sunglasses.   

Accelleration with the 5sp is not good unless you drive at high rpm's.  
Gas Mileage is 26 mpg in town with a 5sp and a/c on full time.  

The Clutch ignition lockout feature is annoying.  The Clutch pedal has to be 
jammed onto floor before you can activate ignition.  

Rear gate must be very firmly closed (almost slammed shut) otherwise it 
does not lock.

Occassionally the AC puts out an unpleasant odor."
pontiac,vibe,2003,brunnecc, 11/25/2002,Best Bang for the $,4,"More comfortable inside than any of the 
Vibes rivals.  I am NOT a GM fan, but, 
this little car is not the typical GM.  
Developed by Toyota, you can drive this 
car and feel the build quality of a 
Toyota/Lexus product.  No other $20K 
car offers Navigation, especially DVD-
Based Nav.  Welcome to the 21st 
Century, GM.  Continue to share with 
you Japaneese peers."
pontiac,vibe,2003,Shari, 01/06/2003,I love my Vibe!,4,"The Vibe is a great car for the money.  
It looks great and the stick gives it 
good power.  Put a portable console in 
the back between my kids and they still 
have plenty of room.  The ride is a 
little hard (I'm going to get it 
checked out), and I'm only getting 29 
mpg, but I'm still getting used to the 
stick.  People who complained about 
smaller cargo (grocery bags) sliding 
around should get a trunk organizer -- 
it worked great for me and doesn't take 
up much space.  Also, put a small rug 
in -- it helps a lot."
pontiac,vibe,2003,badvibe, 01/08/2003,My first SUV/sports car!,4,"Pros: If you are in the $25K and under
market and like a versatile attractive
crossover, and are tall (over 6'), go
drive one and take it home overnight.
Bonus: great safety ratings. The
navigator system is absolutely awesome
if you take trips.

Cons: It's not a BMW. You need cargo
mats or nets for the rear. Turn the
radio up so the motor doesn't bug you.
The interior trim is a bit utilitarian.
We had some faults such as a non closing
latch on the console compartment, the
driver's door power controls came off
partially during the first 200 miles.
Guess we'll see how good service is.

P.S. I call my GT the Bad Vibe because
it wants to go way over the speed limit!"

pontiac,vibe,2003,AKSA, 07/16/2003,Everybody loves my Vibe,4,"Wherever I go, my car gets looks (even 
a year after I bought it).  People, 
sometimes total strangers, ask me how I 
like it, and I always tell them that I 
love it.  The proof is for those who 
get to ride in it.  The unanimous 
decision is that the Vibe-GT rocks.
It has tons of cargo space.  It has 
excellent performance:  Acceleration is 
better than most V-6 cars, although it 
doesn't really come alive until above 
4000 RPM, with explosive acceleration 
hitting at 6000 (ie you have to push it 
hard to really move).  Handling is 
surprisingly good thanks to a tight 
suspension. The ride is quite smooth - 
I have yet to have a CD skip, even over 
railroad tracks."
pontiac,vibe,2003,dkrblaze, 06/19/2003,Pontiac's Best Kept Secret,4,"I've been looking for new wheels for 
quite a while now, and came across the 
Vibe.  After test driving the GT model, 
with the 6-speed manual trans, I was 
sold!  This thing is a rocket!  Same 
car as the Toyota Matrix, but with an 
American nametag.  Smart looking 
vehicle, with a TON of room on the 
inside.  Seats 4 adults really 
comfortably, and rear seats fold down 
to create a lot of room for moving just 
about anything!  For the money this is 
a wonder car.  Way to go Pontiac!"
pontiac,vibe,2003,JVB, 06/18/2003,Great 2nd Car,4,"My wife and I bought the Vibe as a 
second car.  We are both 6ft+ and it 
has great head room and fair leg 
room.  It also good gas milage.  The 
back seat has room for a car seat and 
two grandparents.  We are very happy 
with it."
pontiac,vibe,2003,ginandtonic45, 07/09/2003,So Happy!,4,"I was SO hesistant about buying this 
car.  I was downsizing from a Chevy 
Blazer and wasn't sure I wanted an 
American car again.  I had to test 
drive it three times.  But I love it 
now.  It's reliable - good in our 
winter snowstorms - and incredibly fun 
to drive, even if it's only a 4 
cylinder.  There is a ton of storage 
space and it will make a great ""baby"" 
car in a few years.  I get tons of 
comments on it - how cool it looks

car by far the best new car I have ever 
purchased. Seats are so comfortable and 
so easy to get in an out of. I averaged 
over 35 mpg on a 6k trip over the 
winter. WHY WOULD ANYONE BUY A 
CUMBERSOME SUV AFTER TEST DRIVING THIS 
CAR. I have not had this car back to 
the dealer except for an oil change. I 
can actually get my Kayak inside for 
short trips. I love this car and can 
truthfuly say its the best car I have 
ever owed and I have owned over 30 
cars. Originally bought for looks and 
price (Toyota engine & transmission) 
but its so much more than that. "
pontiac,vibe,2003,robin, 07/18/2003,pontiac vibe,4,"I love the car but the seats and

Sun Roof opens and closes."
pontiac,vibe,2003,kathisma, 12/02/2004,Good vibes from my Vibe.,4,"I've only owned Hondas but this is certainly the BEST car Pontiac ever made. It has youthful looks, a well engineered Toyota engine, handles well, and is made with good quality materials.  However, it's not perfect. NUMMI assembly quality doesn't appear to be as good as for the Matrix - Pontiac take note! Our quality related issues include a broken off door handle (from regular use), some fit and finish inconsistencies, passenger door window mechanism problem, barely-there A/C and heating, and low quality, prematurely wearing tires. Dealer servicing is not the greatest and the receipts are confusing. But, overall, the car looks good, is comfortable and mechanically reliable. I'd buy another."
pontiac,vibe,2003,cieglo, 01/11/2005,Rockin' Red Wagon,4,"I've been looking at the vibe and it's ever-more-numerous competitors (ZX5, Mazda3-5door, protoge5, PT Cruiser) and it's Matrix twin, but all along I knew I wanted the Vibe.  I drove a GT a year ago and loved it...but it took that long to find a used one all optioned-up and for a reasonable price.  Now, a week later, I love it.  Drives great, feels gret on the road, looks great inside and out.  Even with 25,000miles on it when I bought it it looks and feels brand new.  Did I mention it drives great? Everyone who sees it likes it.  I've loaded it up with gear, driven it like a race-car, hauled passengers, cranked the stereo and everything comes up smelling like roses...all good!"
pontiac,vibe,2003,Rick Sundeen, 01/28/2005,Hoped for more than I received,4,"I purchased my Pontiac Vibe with high hopes of a versatile automobile with high gas mileage.  While the versatility aspect has been fine, I feel that the gas mileage isn't up to par with what they suggest.  Given that it is a four cylinder with less than hoped for response, it's getting around 24 instead of the hoped for closer to 30 mpg.  Even being on top of air filter and tire pressure maintenance...  Also, the biggest downfall is in winter driving.  I live in the Northeast and this car should not be sold here.  The OEM tires are rated A for traction and temperature, but they have no grip whatsoever.  I have to believe that the weight of the car is not distributed over the tires properly."
pontiac,vibe,2003,Karen's commuter, 10/11/2003,Loved it at first!!,3,"This car is a great car.  Fun to 
drive, great looking, fits all sizes...
at first the gas milage was 32, now it 
averages 26-28.  Still good, but not 
what i wanted.  There is no back 
support and if you commute, invest in 
a pillow!!  That is my number one 
complaint.  Other than that, I love it.

I cheaped out and leased a 2003 Vibe w/ a manual transmission-the only options on the car are alloy wheels and a 6 disc CD changer.  I am very happy with the vehicle.  It gets great gas mileage and I was surprised how much stuff I got in it with the rear seats folded down (dressers, lawn mower, tables).  I owned a GMC Jimmy several years ago and experienced one quality defect after another so I was aprehensive about going with another GM product.  But since this is really a Toyota in a GM skin it has proved to be reliable and solidly built."

got the heart of a Toyota and the body 
of a Pontiac.
The car hugs the road around corners, 
handles better than any vehicle I've 
ever owned, and has a 5 star crash 
test and gets 30 mpg. locally. I got 
the 5 speed with the moon and tunes 
package (Sunroof and 200 watt sound 
system) and the safety package with 
side air bags and antilock brakes. The 
storage space is amazing with the back

I've been pleased with the swap.  The car accelerates crazily when you hit 6000 RPM, but around town with my wife & son, it's quite docile.  It's a real Jekyll-and-Hyde kind of car.  The handling is nice, the brakes are strong, and I do get 30+ MPG on the highway consistently.  I drive over 30K miles/year, most of them highway, so that's a nice add (especially with Premium selling for $3/gallon now). I'll definitely consider another one next fall when it'll need replacing."

I bought it because it was half-Toyota, yet it had an all- American name.   Overall, I'm satisfied with it.  Many people have commented on stylin it is.  I like the interior features (the electric outlet, the many small storage compartments) and the old-school Pontiac style dashboard, lighted red at night. However, I don't care for the style of the rear-end, and I've had minor electrical problems (battery, sunroof, the interior map light).  Also, the pick-up is kind of slow.  Interested?

me. Interior ergonomics are right on. 
Driver's seating is perfect. Cargo

Mileage is excellent, low 30's for my

brakes are great. A disappointment has 
been the 200 watt stereo. The door 
speakers rattle. In 30,000 miles, my

consideration to the Chevy Avalanche

(small, sporty, but very useful) for 
way less $$ than the Mini or the 
enormous Avalanche.  With the base 
Vibe, I routinely get 36mpg on trips,

Getting about 27- 29 mpg combined, and the one snowy day we had this winter the AWD preformed fine.  No rattles, smells, or funny noises.

The Moon and Tunes package is great- the sound is surprisingly good w/ rds display. The car is just easy to drive. Easy to park, easy to enter and exit, comfortable seats (which still show no wear). I average 30 mpg driving very aggressively. It handles well and holds an amazing amount of stuff (considering it's shorter than a Civic, its astounding) as well as hauling hundreds of pounds in the back without hurting handling.

I've owned my car for three years and have had almost no issues.  It has been extremly reliable.  The only problem is that the stock tires wore out quickly and needed to be replaced with less than 30k miles on the car.  I am impressed with the quality of the interior.

to do this faster than I care to just 
to keep from killing the engine.  
Engine is great if you get it above

driving a motorcycle. Above 6000 RPMs

I average around 29 mpg combined, and got 35 on a recent trip.  It handles great, too!  The interior is so versatile, and the rear seats fold to make a flat cargo floor.  There's plenty of legroom, and the build quality is top notch.  I would prefer it to be a bit quieter at highway speeds, but what do you want for $20k!

My differential went out and I had to replace my transmission and clutch for $3100 which my mechanic also said wasn't in good shape. I didn't take out the extended warranty because it's a Toyota. I just got it back and now my check engine light is coming on. Another Problem? Even though I still owe on the loan, I'm thinking about getting rid of it and going back to the Honda Civic."
pontiac,vibe,2003,chrilad, 05/15/2007,Good Vibe - Brations,4,"Bought the 2003 Vibe in May of 2003. A little nervous being a first model year. The Vibe has been nothing but reliable. We chose the All-wheel Drive model to deal with winters in Upstate NY. Handles even the heavies snow and ice with no problem. Plenty of room and all seats fold to form a single flat surface for loads. Approaching 47,000 miles and only performed routine maintenance and tires. Not the fastest car on the road by any means, but can get up to highway speed in average time. This is essentially a Toyota, but with Pontiac badge, insurance will be slightly less."
pontiac,vibe,2003,Terry Sack, 10/10/2007,Some Good-Some Bad,3,"I bought the Vibe because I have had a Corolla with 270,000 miles on it with no problems. Must have gotten a lemon as engine went out at 80,000miles ($5000 and GM laughed at me---never another GM vehicle for me). Also replaced 2 catalytic converters---never did this before on the many, many cars I have owned.  Check engine light has been on more than it is off.  Noted others had tire problems--so did I. Tire shop said camber was off from factory.  Other than the expenses above the car has been fun to drive and gets great mileage---lots of room.  I will never deal with GM again, however."
pontiac,vibe,2003,SalsaVibe, 04/29/2003,Totally Salsafied!,5,"The Pontiac Vibe is a fun and smooth 
ride.  It isn't a power vehicle, but 
has a great deal of spunk 
and quickness.  The handling is tight 
around curves and in traffic.  There 
is plenty of leg and head room in the 
front and backseats.  If you need to 
haul things instead of people, put 
down the 60/40 backseat and load up.  
The base model Vibe along with the 
Moon & Tunes and power package offers 
all the comforts you need for a long 
or short trip.  The 200 watt stereo 
sounds clear.  With plenty of space 
and ergonomically placed controls and 
compartments, the Vibe is definitely 
your home away from home."
pontiac,vibe,2003,alohajl2, 05/11/2003,Great Car Value!!,4,"This car is a real bargain, especially 
now while GM is offering great 
discounts. Our deal was about $4k or 
more under MSRP and the car is 
delivering strong mileage numbers of 
about 35 mpg plus on highway and upper 
20s mpg in town. I liked the appearance 
of the Matrix better than the Vibe, but 
the Toyota discounts were measly.  "
pontiac,vibe,2003,Tom Snooks, 01/23/2003,Form without function,3,"The must uncomfortable car I have ever 
driven. I would not reccommend to anyone 
over 5 foot 6.  The steering wheel is very far 
away and the tilt wheel is useless. To get 
close enough to the steering wheel for my

the gas and brake. I am only 5' 9""!!!"
pontiac,vibe,2003,Frosty, 03/26/2003,Best car ever owned,5,"We have been very happy with this car.
Never been back for service or 
problems, only done oil changes.
Been all the way from Canada to Key 
West Florida and back, never skipped a 
beat.
Have the odd squeak or rattle, but no 
big deal, very solid car.
We have the Base 5 speed, totally happy 
with the performance/economy.
Very poor service from GM Canada while 
buying the car.  It took 5 months to 
deliver, with no warning of this 
inconvenience."
pontiac,vibe,2003,DRB007, 06/11/2003,Nice Family Car!,4,"Comfortable car for two adults and two 
car seats.  Went on a 1,200 mile trip, 
almost completely satisfied.  Had a TV 
and cell phone plugged in for the Whole 
trip with barney on the CD.  Highway 
road noise was a little much.  Needed 
more power driving through the Smokey's."

pontiac,vibe,2003,furrydogs, 06/26/2003,I can't believe I bought a Pontiac,4,"Never thought I'd own an American car, 
if you can call it that. Bought it in 
December and I have almost 13000 miles 
on it. Very happy so far. In the short 
time that I have had it I have taken 
quite a few road trips with it and 
have been quite comfortable. I 
think it is a great riding car that 
gets awesome mileage. One small gripe 
is my front fender panel is loose so I 
will have to take that in to get 
fixed. Also, the A/C isn't very cold. 
The options I have are: Moonroof, 200 
Watt CD Stereo, Rims, and power 
package. My MPG with a 5-speed manual 
averages 33 on the hiway and about 30 
in the city. I almost forgot, the 
cargo room is exceptional."
pontiac,vibe,2003,dreaelles, 07/01/2003,2003 Pontiac Vibe GT is FUN to drive,4,"I bought a Pontiac Vibe GT in December, 
2002.  It is a lot of fun to drive.  It 
handles really well and is great on gas 
milage...I get about 30/gallon on the 
highway (if not more).  It has an 
aggressive look that I like better than 
its sister car, the Toyota Matrix.  It 
did have some problems 
though...dashboard rattles (one is easy 
to fix with an inch of electrical tape 
and about 60 seconds of time)and the 
glove box had a rattle which I think 
was just a loose cover over a screw.  
My cd player was making a weird noise 
when I would apply the breaks, but the 
dealer replaced it with a new one which 
seems to be just fine.  Over all, a 
great car!!"
pontiac,vibe,2003,Michelle, 05/21/2008,Intense research paid off!!!,4,"Couldn't be more pleased w/ this vehicle, unlike the ""second car"" for cash I bought at the same time (1996 Ford Contour) - we've stuck thousands into that lemon! The Vibe however, is a delight. There have been a few fixes...oxygen sensor, broken outside door handle (that's one thing which I found was true, plastic on interior and exterior on the cheaper side). We have grown our family fast, and I can actually put 3 car seats across the back. It's deceivingly roomy. The cargo area is decent and even my 6'3"" husband doesn't feel cramped in the front seat. Remember when servicing this car, take it to someone who knows Toyota engines (Tuffy replaced some fluids), I was told this is a no no."
pontiac,vibe,2003,Tony, 04/10/2018,Nice car,4,"Engine has good HP. But next to no lowend grunt. Pedals way to close together. Much nicer looking than the Toyota version. I have done as good as 48 MPG. One cheap car to own. And better mileage than a Smart Car, and twice as big, and has a spare tire.

pontiac,vibe,2003,Mike, 10/21/2009,"Good Car - 163,000 miles",4,"I bought my Vibe new in January '03, and it has been very reliable. I was horrified at first, when I leaned against the front fender, and it caved in like a paper bag, but the drivetrain is pure Toyota. I had a sensor replaced at around 100K for around $100, but that's it. I changed the hoses and serpentine belt, and flushed the radiator at around 80K, but that's it. My check engine light and airbag light are on, but it still runs great. It doesn't heat up until highway speed, so I think the thermostat is sticking. I am 6'3 and 275#, but I fit fine. My family of 4, and our luggage got 33mpg @ 80mph when the car was new!"
pontiac,vibe,2003,cor, 06/20/2002,Vibe GT testdrive,3,"I had high expectations going in, but 
was dissapointed after the testdrive. 
Maybe there was something wrong with 
this particular GT, because it was 
extremely slow, even when I punched it. 
It seemed solid, nice looking on the 
outside. I hated the interior, 
especially the impossible to see red on 
black guages. Also, The walls are thin. 
I could hear all kinds of noise from 
outside. wasn't wind or road noise, 
just thin walls / no soundproofing."
pontiac,vibe,2003,Kristy, 05/17/2010,"Great on gas, but poor engine",3,"I bought my vibe because I have heard such good reviews, and I liked the fact that it is a Toyota in disguise, but I am truly dissapointed. The check engine light came on and when checked out, it turns out I need a catalytic converter, also it has started losing oil so a compression test was done and I need a new engine also, which is why my cat. converter went bad. I have been sooo upset because I dont have the money to just go and put a whole new engine in and I have to have a car. Regular oil changes have always been done in this car so we dont know why the engine has went bad. I hope everyone else has better luck with their vibe."
pontiac,vibe,2003,lp911, 08/27/2002,concerned,4,"I have owned my Vibe GT for about 4 1/2 
months now and I am still a little 
concerned.  Performance/handling is 
impressive and I like the styling but 
quality control is in question.  The 
keyless remote went out and has been to 
the shop 4 times for said problem.  The 
interior is starting to rattle itself 
apart and the front right wheel squeaks 
(they can't find whats wrong).  Fuel 
consumption is about 32 mpg combined 
the exhaust note is pleasing.  I am 
simply apprehensive about such a high 
reving engine."
pontiac,vibe,2003,Marcg, 02/22/2003,Vibe GT in Alberta,3,"Did four road trips since purchasing 
the car on December 31st.

Impressed by overal design of vehicle, 
especially considering this is its 
first year on market.

Problems found in the first two months:
Wrong size of cigarette lighter 
originally installed in vehicle.

Rattle coming from left side of dash.

Panel covering spare tire misaligned 
with its latches.

Slightly disapointing milleage. 

I suspect that once I figure how to 
remove the roof rack cross-bars and K&N 
air filters become available for this 
car I can drive 3-4 miles more per 
gallon.

pontiac,vibe,2003,Steve S, 05/14/2007,4+ years and going strong,4,"I bought this car the first model year as I liked its good gas mileage, a small exterior for easier parking in NYC but a lot of inside room. As I am 6'2"" I was impressed that I could sit and have plenty of head room. It also gave more leg room that vehicles that are a lot bigger. Good car for the city and hwy driving is nice but could use a bit more pep. Mileage is great. I have had only one problem with the vehicle which came within the warranty period. One of the sensors in the gas tank malfunctioned which prevented any gas from being pumped into the tank. Took 4 days for the dealer to get the part and fix it and then they lost the keys. Would definitely buy another one."
pontiac,vibe,2003,Sarlak1@aol.com, 03/06/2003,2003 Pontiac Vibe GT,3,"Having owned my Vibe GT for 3 months 
and 4,700 miles I can now make an 
educated review of this product.  For 
starters, the initial quality is very 
poor. I have brought my Vibe GT to the 
shop 3 different times for the same 3 
problems. 1) The front end alignment 
would never stay centered. 2) The rear 
passenger door hatch needed fixing 3 
different times. 4) And lastly, the 
dashboard has had a rattle since day 
one due to the overly done up 
speedometer/tachometer chromatic 
covering. The have replaced the piece 2 
times and it rattles to this very day. 
At 20,000 I would expect the qaulity to 
be above entry-level,which this car's 
is not."
pontiac,vibe,2003,spark123, 10/19/2004,Vibe / Matrix Mediocre car at best,2,"Expensive car to maintain and drive.
Maintainence parts hard to come by.
Car requires special tires $125 each 
for cheapest.
Poor fuel economy for size 28MPG 
Highway. Poor acceleration. Poor HVAC 
system. Harsh ride.  Fair handling. 
Lots of squeaks and rattles. Found out 
after I bought it it actually was a 
Toyota. Reliability is good after 
70000.  Large blind spots at all 4 
corners."
pontiac,vibe,2003,andrear, 02/21/2005,Little things got annoying over time...,2,"I really liked this car at first, but over the last two years little things have started to annoy me.  First of all the gas millage is awful, and always has been. I was led on to believe that this car was so great on gas and that was never the case.  Also the blind spot on this car is boarder line dangerous.  You can't see the dash lights in the sun because they are red and set back to far.  Also the center compartment thing comes open over every bump.  I ignored these things for a while, but now they are getting hard to live with.  The car is not that fun to drive and handles awful in the snow."
pontiac,vibe,2003,93pontiacga, 05/14/2013,Not bad but not what I expected.,4,"Being a Toyota, I thought I could get at least 250k miles out of it before any major repairs. They say about cars nickle and diming you after they got older. This car never did that, it just slammed me with a book. I replaced the cat once, which was under warranty. At 188k, I replaced the clutch. Great so far. It has 219k on it now and it just cost me almost as much to fix as the car is worth. Needless to say, I most likely wont get another car with a Toyota engine in it."
pontiac,vibe,2003,JoeUser, 03/08/2002,Week but cost effective,2,"I regret this purchase.  Not that the Vibe isn't a good, well designed car... it just isn't what I really wanted... and thus isn't what I should have purchased.  The car is weak and it's handeling is sloppy.  I like the exterier and interier but the parts are cheap.  (You get what you pay for.)  My biggest complaint is the engine."

for it's better gas milage and $1,500 
GM Card rebate, but it was a difficult 
decission!  Cruiser rules in the looks 
dept and has comparable build quality, 
but could not swallow the 19-25 EPA 
fuel milage.  Good car, but my 2000 
Ford Focus has better steering response 
and handling.  If you need lots of room 
and a ""Toyota"" reputation, the Vibe is 
a good choice, but for the Enthusist

acceleration with full passenger load.  
Dashboard looks fantastic at night, but 
bright sunlight can wash out the red 
illumination and create a reflection on 
the silver rimmed gauges."
pontiac,vibe,2003,fwviber, 03/10/2009,"93,000 Miles and no major issues",4,"We bought our Vibe 3 years ago and it still looks and runs great. We traded in an SUV to save on gas money. The savings has been great. We get around 30 mpg no matter where we drive. We have owned the car from 36,000 to 93,000 miles and have only had to replace the alternator, outside of your normal tires and brake replacements."

pontiac,vibe,2003,drw2514, 05/28/2002,Fun Little Car,5,"The Vibe is an extremely fun little car.
 I love driving it and find myself
making excuses to go out just so I can
have some fun with it!  It handles
wonderfully, especially for being so
tall.  There  is very little body roll
in the corners.  Parking is a breeze
because of the tight turning radius. 
Wherever I go, I get looks of admiration
from other drivers because of the
polarizing styling.  The interior is
very well laid
out, and all the controls are very
logical.  The 6-disc CD changer plays
very well.  I have had
no problems with this car whatsoever,
having put nearly 1500 miles on it in
the 3 weeks that I've owned it.  A
wonderful buy!"
pontiac,vibe,2003,Brandy, 01/21/2008,Love my Vibe,5,"I love how I can fold down the back seats and fit almost anything in this small car that has so much space and room.  Plus I am very tall and wanted something that had plenty of leg room for the driver and all the passengers, this has it.  Lots of room for a car!!!  The vibe has good fuel economy and plenty of room!  I love it."
pontiac,vibe,2003,jacobja, 06/06/2002,Fun car,5,"Wanted to buy a Toyota Matrix first, 
but the sales people at Toyota where 
very arrogant. Went to Pontiac and the 
Vibe looks nicer. We bought a manual 
transmission in monotone with the Moon 
and Tunes and six CD changer.

This is a great car, drives good, well 
build and very friendly dealership and 
service. On sad story is that we could 
not get ABS, no manual transmissions 
with ABS available with the exception 
for the GT version."
pontiac,vibe,2003,Bart Buttles, 06/07/2002,I love my VIBE,5,"I have been in my VIBE for a few 
weeks.  The car is perfect.  I liked 
the look, pricing, and dealer far 
better than the Toyota Matrix.  I test 
drove the Matrix, it is like a station 
wagon.  The VIBE has it all.  

Vibe rocks, Civic is bland....."

practical and yet very sporty.  So far 
I have no complaints."
pontiac,vibe,2003,Feather, 10/18/2009,Love my Vibe!,5,"We bought the Vibe new in 2003 and have only had to do the brakes, oil changes, and tires - and we're almost at 100K (97K right now).  Even though we can't fit three car seats in the back (darn!) and have #3 on the way, we are keeping this car as my husband's daily driver.  Easy to drive, enough horsepower for me - LOVE the storage capabilities with this car, and I would recommend one to anyone. Definitely impressed with my first (and what seems like my last due to the demise of the brand) Pontiac."
pontiac,vibe,2003,Barry Godlstein, 06/14/2002,Pontiac Vibe-Great Car,4,"This car was everything I thought it 
would be & more. The gas mileage is 
excellent. The car averages 26.5 in 
the ciy & 32 on the highway. The car 
rides very smooth & the handling is 
great. I just wish they made an 
automatic in the GT version. I would 
have liked the bigger engine."
pontiac,vibe,2003,aurora, 06/15/2002,"just a gander, and you'll be sold",5,"This is one heck-of-a-car. It has anything and everything you could possibly 
want or need. For a very reasonable price you can ABS, 6-cd in-dash 
changer, AC, Power everything, moon roof, and a 200-watt sound system. 
Its a BLAST to drive. Its fast and efficient and just all around amazing. I 
would tell ANYONE to get this car. They would not be dissapointed."
pontiac,vibe,2003,BobL, 06/29/2002,Vibe Does it All 4 Me,5,"Great car, great concept.  Very nimble, 
fast out the gate.  Impressive mileage. 
Size just right.  Nav system is worth 
the extra $1600; NAV is easy to use -- 
the system shows your position on the 
map, plus talks you to your destination 
in a normal voice telling you where to 
turn, and isn't animated sounding.  LUV 
this car, a long term keeper."
pontiac,vibe,2003,MLR, 07/04/2002,Good VIBErations!!,4,"This vehicle combines the fun factor 
of a sports car with the practicality of 
an SUV.  The interior and exterior 
styling is quite contemporary; the 
interior appointments are well 
executed and typical of vehicles in  
higher price ranges.  The amount of 
cargo space with the seats down is 
amazing for a small vehicle.  The six-
speed manual transmission is 
smooth with the gear ratios well-
placed.  This vehicle is well 
engineered and constructed, yet is 
reasonably priced.  Some might 
object to the rather noisy engine but 
it has a sports car sound that I really 
like."
pontiac,vibe,2003,Wisconsin, 07/11/2002,Great run around car,5,"This is a great little car.  I've been 
waiting about 5 years to use my GM 
credit card $s but could not find 
anything worthwhile in this category 
(midsize, sporty, fun, environmentally 
OK/gas efficient)"
pontiac,vibe,2003,Scott W., 07/17/2002,Good Vibe-rations,4,"The base engine is great and will be 
fine for most people but it's little 
weak for me. With only 5-ft/lb less 
torque (and at a much lower rpm) than 
the GT engine, it is more suited for a 
daily driver. The GT engine is a 
technological wonder but still not as 
powerful as I would like and is not as 
practical in my opinion with it's high 
rev'ing needs. Both engine are just 
average in low RPMs but are fantastic 
when the tach gets above 3000-rpm. A 
V6/auto would be a good addition in the 
future and the engine bay appears to 
have enough room for one.

Bottom line: I'm keeping this Vibe 
until a V6 becomes an option."
pontiac,vibe,2003,DerekS1287, 07/18/2002,Outstanding Fun Drive,5,"Wonderful fun car to drive. Open the

big.  Really comfortable."
pontiac,vibe,2003,Mikes vibe, 07/21/2002,2003 Vibe,4,"I have 3500 miles on my Vibe and have
been very pleased. I drive it back and
forth to work [construction site - not
paved] every day and the wife and I do
all of our running around in it. The
engine is peppy enough but has to be
revved. I didnt want the GT version
because it requires premium gas and
makes its power above 6000 rpm. Have
been happy with the 5 spd. Have averaged
29.54 mpg for the first 10 tanks-this at
80mph on highway with air running. Got
32 for 1 tank that was more highway than
city. Car very functional. Has decent
ground clearance and carries my toolbag
and lunch box . Plastic cladding not the
best looking stuff in the world but very
functional.."
pontiac,vibe,2003,Phaidra, 07/22/2002,My favorite car!,5,"The price is fair for this vehicle.  It 
handles well and is fun to drive.  I'm 
used to V6 vehicles, so occasionally do 
miss the power, but the added mileage 
more than compensates.  This vehicle 
has more oomph than I expected and 
pulls me right up the hills."

TOTAL MILEAGE IS 4,000."
pontiac,vibe,2003,Freefallin', 07/24/2002,Love the Vibe,4,"I first drove the Vibe because I liked 
the exterior design.  After the test 
drive I put my  name on a waiting list 
to recieve one.  Interior design and 
space were excelent. Very comfortable  
to drive or ride in, front or back 
seat. Handling is great. Fuel 
economy!  30+ mpg on very first tank.  
Very easy to load Kayak on the roof by 
myself."
pontiac,vibe,2003,snsracer, 07/30/2002,LIL' Rocket,4,"I drive a race car with a 4-CYC Yamaha 
engine and am used to red lining the 
tach. Naturally, I chose the Vibe GT 
and love the powerband at 6 grand!! 
This car is a kick in the pants to 
drive and loaded with the NAV system 
you wont ever get lost. I am 18 and 
couldn't be more happy with my choice!"
pontiac,vibe,2003,New Vibe Owner, 08/07/2002,"Practical, Affordable, Fun",5,"I never saw myself buying an American 
car. I compared the Toyota Matrix with 
this car and they are virtually 
identical. The ride on both is tight 
and firm, the engine/trans is Toyota.   
I chose the Vibe for it's better 
styling, higher ground clearance, and 
better price ($1000 rebate at this 
time).  Essentially, The Vibe and 
Matrix are the same car with different 
body panels and minor nuances in the 
interior.   The advantage of the Matrix 
is that the resale value will be higher 
because of the Toyota name, and the 
engine warranty is slightly better 
(60,000 miles vs. GMC's 36,000)."
pontiac,vibe,2003,btbrewer, 08/18/2002,Jamin' GT,5,"Perfect car.  Way more fun to drive

years ago."

about 3 weeks now and everytime I see 
it I get a big smile on my face.  After 
searching for the perfect car for about 
6 months, I saw a Vibe on the road next 
to me.  Test drove it the next day and 
I was in love!"

the power package about a week ago and 
I am enjoying the driving and the looks 
of envy people give me when they see my 
Vibe.  The Base VIBE is quicker (auto 
trans.) than similar vehicles with 
comparable hoursepower."
pontiac,vibe,2003,kirbylit, 09/19/2002,My Vibe,5,"We looked at the Vibe on a lark - after 
seeing the really good commercials - 
when we were needing a small family get 
around town car.  We test drove and 
liked it instantly.  The car has much 
more interior room, and the 6'2 
passengers we put on board have no 
problem with either leg or head room.  
Gas mileage around 30 on the highway 
and 24 in the city makes this a very 
affordable option to an SUV or mini-
van.  With a 6 speed manual 
transmission, the GT option we got made 
for a car with some pep as well as a 
lot of style."
pontiac,vibe,2003,Gogginsmit, 09/22/2002,GM is finally back on the right track!,4,"I had no intention of buying a car when 
my room mate went car shopping.  I had 
a Taurus wagon that, although boring, 
was great for Home Depot trips, hauling 
my bike, and my 140lb. Lab (Moose) 
around town.  We saw the Vibe and 
Matrix at three dealers before actually 
even sitting in one.  One drive and we 
were both sold.  The more you drive it, 
the more fun it is.  Plus, I can 
actually fit more lumber and stuff in 
the Vibe than my Taurus and save $15 a 
week in gas!!  Pontiac dealers 
consistently offered more rebates, 
price concessions, and cash for my 
trade than Toyota which will more than 
make up for any difference in resale 
value."
pontiac,vibe,2003,Barbara Joseph, 10/14/2002,assessment,4,"I have not had the car very long, but I 
like it a lot.  It drives just like a 
car but is a small SUV.  It handles 
well in traffic and will accelerate to 
50-60 miles in a few seconds.  It 
handles well on the highway and 
visibility is excellent.  I do hear a 
whining sound which Pontiac says is 
because it is new and they will check 
it in 1 week."
pontiac,vibe,2003,RudeDude, 10/16/2002,"Way to go, GM & Toyota",5,"Bought the Vibe as a replacement for my 
wife's 1996 Pontiac Gran Prix that 
served us well after 6 years and 
135,000 trouble free miles. When 
driving the car, it rides amazingly 
quite for a 1.8L 4-cyl with an 
automatic, and has a good deal of pep 
as well. It also ""feels"" like it should 
be bigger. 

Don't judge this car by its size as it 
has a lot of interior room. The 
salesrep that showed us the car was 
6'4"" tall and easily fit in the car 
with headroom to spare."
pontiac,vibe,2003,King, 10/21/2002,Good Vibrations,4,"The Vibe is an excellent alternative to 
gas guzzling SUV's.  It's a perfect 
second car, or a great primary car for 
someone who doesn't want to pay 
inflated SUV prices.

Fuel economy is very good, utility is 
excellent, and there's plenty of room 
for 5 with a large amount of cargo 
space.  The vibe rides like a larger 
car, and handles well.  This car is 
well designed.

Engine power is adequate for most 
driving needs.  I'd be in heaven with a 
slightly stronger engine (more horse 
power)."

and functionality of this car.  I don't 
think any other car that gets 36mpg 
compares in power and size. I like most 
of the things about this car, but there 
are a few poorly designed features.

The roof rack is way too short and the 
antenna is in the way.

The rear door requires a huge amount of 
effort to latch closed.  

Why not make it a little longer?  
Simply extending the cargo area further 
beyond the rear wheels would give a lot 
more space with minimal impact on 
handling.

The guages are difficult to read."
pontiac,vibe,2003,KR Hall, 11/23/2002,Very Satisfied,5,"I have had this vehicle only a short

this site, and I am 'very pleased'.  I
am considered very practical, and this
is.  It has good room, good mileage,
good power, good looks, and just
incredible overall good utility
including the roof rack.  For my 60 & 80
pound dogs, roomy, even throwing in my
6'4"" friend.  It is tight too.  I didn't
expect it to corner so well either.  An
SUV/family van which is sporty and not
clunky."

great on gas mileage and although I 
don't believe I am the intended market 
buyer for this car (mother of two) I 
couldn't be happier. The features on 
the car out way this car to the Matrix. 
I perfer the body style to the Matrix, 
otherwise, it's about the same car. For 
$2000 less for the rebate and bumping 
the price down a little, I paid less 
than I would have for the Matrix."

surprised by the expansive cargo room 
and fun drive.  When you combine the 
cool exterior design, and excellent gas 
mileage - averaging 32 on highway and 
28 in city driving, you can't beat the 
value.  I have had my Vibe for two 
months and love it.  The only minor 
complaint I have is the blind spot in 
bwtween the rear seats and the back 
window.  I am hopeful that Pontiac will 
include an MP3 aux jack in the next 
version and have the radio satellite 
ready.  If you are looking for a fun

pontiac,vibe,2004,Kim Business, 07/06/2016,Vibe one of the top 2 most reliable cars in decade,5,"Vibe owners love our Vibes.  Reliable, good acceleration, good mileage.  Engine (same as Toyota Corolla) built by Toyota with Pontiac styling.  Awesome killer sound system.  Moonroof slides open, and can tilt vent too.  I have owned my VIBE for 15 yrs.  Wish they were still making new ones!  Comfy ride (I am a very large person, and seats fit and feel great!).  Nice feature...back of fold down seats is hard quality plastic which makes cargo compartment very durable and washable.  D rings  in cargo area for tie downs.  Great visibility with all the windows.  Sporty, spunky, practical and fun!  (make sure airbags have been ""fixed"" on recall, check your VIN to see if ""complete, there were 2 recalls on the same repair like most vehicles in U.S).  No worries though GM dealers will fix in a snap.  Still love my Vibe for all the reasons mentioned!  Oh, the driver and passenger's seats fold all the way back in case you need to take a nap on a long trip etc.  Cool sporty instrumentation too!  Good handling around corners, if you get good tires, great handling in snow, and rain.  Gas mileage is very good (ave. 29mpg city and highway together) Best in it's class!

pontiac,vibe,2004,Kile, 01/19/2016,"Vanessa, my vivacious Vibe",5,"I have had this car for 5 years now. Bought it used with 40,000 miles on it, and it now as 204,000 and still drives like it always has! I used it to commute to and from college (approx. 1-1.5hr highway) for 2 years, took it from PA to FL once, and PA to NC probably 30 times. I'm a big traveler, and this car is great in all situations. First let me start by saying the AWD is unbeatable. I've driven trucks and SUV's that handle worse in the snow than this little beast. I used to live up in a mountainous area, where we always got at least 6 more inches of snow than the surrounding areas, and it does just fine going up and down steep hills in the snow, and yes, even ice. I am an avid snowboarder, so not only does it have ample room in the back with the wagon-like set up and the seats folding down for all of me and my friends' gear, but any time a snowstorm is coming in we PREFER to take my vehicle out just because its capability and reliability in a snowstorm situation. I've driven this on Interstate 80 through a PA snowstorm up in the Poconos with 10inches of snow (at least) on the highway and never had any trouble or loss of traction (keep in mind, some good all-season tires are worth their weight in $ too!). As far as non-inclement weather trips go, I average about 33mpg on highway trips, with a record of 39mpg over 500miles. Not bad for this car! City is like they rate it for, right around 26-28mpg. On our trip to Florida for spring break one year, my friends and I used the handy little 115v two-prong outlet in the front to run an Xbox to keep us busy and entertained on our trip down! It has neat little features like that. I have also moved a series of 5 times, and filled that car up to the brim. The seats fold down in the back (and the passenger), and they actually fold FLAT, and have a hard back so it's almost like having a mini truck. This has been useful soooooo many times, and the interior holds up to this abuse. Nothing is damaged save for a few minor scratches on ""the bed liner"", and the seats are suuupper comfy even for a guy like me (im 6'2""). Being a childish college student, I have not always driven this car easy as well. One of my favorite things to do with it back in the day would be reverse donuts in a wet or snow-filled empty parking lot (not recommended). That kind of beating would wear on most cars, but I've never had any issues with the transmission or engine or anything for that matter. That being said, I love this car, and I have always been very meticulous with the maintenance. The manual recommends an oil change every 4-6,000 miles. I change it every 3. I rotate the tires and check the fluid levels. They say with Toyotas, as long as you keep up with the maintenance, the car will last you forever. I can attest to this! (being that it is the sister car of the toyota matrix). The toyota transmission has handled hill after hill and beating after beating with no trouble. Still shifts like the day I got it. smooooottthhh. I wish I owned the GT so I had a little more acceleration, but it still does great in high traffic, high speed, merging situations. My only complaint, and I have seen this in a toyota matrix, is the gear lights next to the shifter had gone out and that some idiot biker ran into my passenger door and left a little dent. If you're looking into this car and want something reliable, useful, and long-lasting, look no further. Do yourself a favor and pick one up for super cheap.

pontiac,vibe,2004,notloyal, 07/01/2011,Audi to Vibe,4,"Traded an Audi Quattro for this 2004 Vibe, best trade I've ever made.

The Audi was a well built vehicle, but not reliable and expensive to repair, and there were lots of repairs.

The Vibe is reliable, excellent gas mileage, easy to drive and half the cost of the Audi.

Will be getting another Vibe soon."
pontiac,vibe,2004,JK, 10/19/2010,Unbreakable,4,"I bought this car 4 years ago with 20,000 miles on it and it is up to about 110,000. So far the only failures were a belt tensioner ($100 fix) and two of the digital display lights in the radio went out. The car runs like the day I bought it. Mechanically, it seems indestructible. The body and paint are both solid too. I tend to neglect the body and on the rare occasion I wash and polish it, it always looks like it great. Not only is it well built, but it is very comfortable. With some years on the Vibe name now, more and more reviews are from people with 200k+ miles and I hope to be one of them. When the day comes to replace this, I only hope its twin, the Toyota Matrix, is still around."
pontiac,vibe,2004,Carl, 07/26/2016,Love the vibe!,5,"Bought this car 7 years ago with 141000 miles and now has 271000. By far the most reliable vehicle I have ever owned! Nice gas mileage on highway with outstanding handling. Would buy another in a second! Only normal maintenance......brakes, tires, o2 sensor but that's it. Only complaints are: driver seat sits too low and side view mirrors are unreliable. But overall a really terrific automobile. Highly recommend.
"
pontiac,vibe,2004,Larry VP, MN,Great Little Big Car,4,"Has a five speed manual with basic engine.  With rear seats down, will take two bicycles and camping gear for a week.  With front seat down will take eight foot objects like lumber or a projection screen.  On interstate travel with the cruise on 70 MPH, delivers 40 to 44 MPG using quality regular gas.  Roomy rear seat even for those over 6 foot.  On interstate trips with two couples and all luggage inside is comfortable.  Luggage did go to six inches from the top of the rear window.  Mileage also 44 MPG under these conditions in the Midwest.  Traveling near Breckenridge/Frisco, CO (continental divide) vehicle was underpowered going up very steep hills.  Delivered 40 MPG.  Great on snow."
pontiac,vibe,2004,greencleanutah, 04/29/2012,Glad I have one.,4,"My vibe has 155,000 miles. Thanks to TOYOTA for making a great motor the only maintainance i've done is change plugs-which were extremely easy and affordable cause there is no plug wires to replace. tires and the front brake pads were extremely easy to replace. I also like that the back seats have hard plastic on the back of them so when they fold down its like having a small truck. I use this vehicle for my organic carpet cleaning business. Good gas mileage. So far havent found any other vechicle that is as old as this one that looks and operates as good as this one."
pontiac,vibe,2004,JimPaule, 03/28/2010,Best Car I Ever Owned,4,"This 2004 Vibe is the best car I have ever owned in terms of reliability. Six years, 63,000 miles, and never had any warranty work whatsoever! The brakes are still original, even with considerable stop and go driving. GM really blew it by dropping Pontiac and especially the Vibe. It has been a Consumer Reports Best Buy since its inception in 2003! Of all their bad decisions, this one ranks right at the top. We plan to keep this car forever. It tracks through our bad northern Ohio winters with no problem with the all wheel drive and still delivers 20 mpg in town and 28 on the highway. Why would I ever sell this car?"
pontiac,vibe,2004,courtney92381, 04/07/2010,Pontiac Vibe,5,I absolutely love mine.  I bought it in June 2009 and could not be more happy. Will be buying another when it's time to trade this one in for a new model.  Love it's capacity and room.  It has all the luxury of a big SUV but in a smaller package.
pontiac,vibe,2004,docta96, 05/03/2006,Wash and Wear,4,"We have had a variety of AWD continuously since 1974 and this represents the best combination of all.  It is an outstanding blend of economy, comfort, utility and reliability.  We often drive long distances in inclement weather and the AWD Vibe handles everything exceptionally well and without drama or failure while allowing us to always arrive on time. This is my wife's favorite vehicle and she cares for it assiduously.  I have recommended it to many others, along with the Matrix twin."
pontiac,vibe,2004,FLADAD, 04/26/2007,Great Used Value,4,"I have had my Vibe since new and have 45,000 trouble free miles on it now. It is fun to drive and feels bigger than it is while driving. Made by Toyota it will undoubtedly have good reliability thru 150,000. That is my goal. 35mpg at 65mph is true. Only drawback is the rear window washer, it's useless. But that's a small defect in a great car"
pontiac,vibe,2004,mhc, 01/01/2019,Love/hate relationship,4,"Get the car checked by a professional before you purchase. I tend to think that either you get a good one or a bad one!  In all fairness I bought this car in 2014 (10 yrs. old) paid too much, $7500 from a roadside used car dealer (what was I thinking?)  with 108,000 miles.  Have had it for 4 and a half years and it now has 200,000 miles and is going strong!  The first year, I put nearly $2000 in repairs:  wheel bearings, brakes, hood latch,tires, exhaust work, and more...... Last year I had engine work done, (nothing major -oil leak, $400) My current problem  -leaking gas tank!  Can't fill more that half or gas runs out. (yes I'm going to fix it)  Gas mileage (BEFORE leaking tank ) was pretty bad - avg, 25 city - 28 hwy. Come on it is a small car!  But I still love this car!  Looks great, nearly new inside and out. Controls are simple (nothing fancy it is a 15 yr. old car) Has usb's, plugs, etc.. Heater and defroster are absolutely the best! Visibility is darn good for a hatchback, best I could find. Acceleration is awesome, I can pass those trucks - no problem!!!! However, feels  ""tipsy"" if you swerve to avoid a deer or other unexpected ""thing"" which scares me. Seats comfort is ok on short rides , but no so much on a Long trips. Cargo space is amazing - nothing compares, rear seats fold flat giving you even more space. I can put my women's full sized bicycle in the back and not have to remove front wheel! The whole bike slides in and slides out ---so happy! Excellent height for loading and unloading and seating position is also perfect for getting in and out of!  Starting to feel perhaps it is time to get a newer car, but cannot find anything that I like as much as this Vibe!  If you are looking for an older car, I would still HIGHLY recommend, but may not be a best option for younger, more pedal to the metal driver since I feel car could tip over.

pontiac,vibe,2004,Bradford, 02/05/2009,"Reliable, predictable, economical, zzzzz",4,"My Vibe makes me smile. It's the red one you see most often in ads but not the GT. No supercharger. I bought it with 31k and put 32k on it.  Besides oil changes only had to replace front brakes.  Tight steering. Boring to drive but unbeatably reliable. It's a Matrix, after all.  MPG averages 28-29 if I do 70 or under on the freeway and relax in traffic. Lots of space inside when you flatten the back seat. The car rides high for its light weight and you are at the driver level of the average SUV.  You must adjust your mirrors accurately to avoid the blind spots - don't look surprised Toyota/Pontiac - you know they are there. Very easy to park and turn. A truly great little car... but boring. "
pontiac,vibe,2004,doglover, 07/24/2010,It just keeps on going and going,4,"I bought this car in 2004 brand new. I have replaced the brakes twice; that's it. I now have 151,000 and still drive it. I did have problems with the drivers window before the recall. It drives super in the snow; I live in western PA and have never been disappointed with it's performance. I wore out the radio controls. I have the ""moon and tune"" pkg and it rocks; the best sound system that I've come across. Very reliable and easy to drive."
pontiac,vibe,2004,markwiz, 03/22/2006,Pontiac Vibe - Great little car,4,"Basically it is a Toyota Matrix which is really a Carolla Wagon. Greate car. Holds lots of stuff. Looks great with a surfboard on the roof rack. More standard features than the Matrix. The only negative is the rattle around the radio and highway wind noise. I have 36,000 mi. The only repair was the front end alignment when I first bought it."
pontiac,vibe,2004,vibe, 04/18/2006,quality at a good price,5,"I've had my Vibe for 2 years now.  I have live in California and it has been on the beach and over the Sierra Mountians.  Have never had a single problem.  Mileage is what was advertised, although it did take a break-in period to get there.  The paint on the bumpers and bottom door trim could be a little better.  I'm a big 50 year old man.   It takes me camping and on business trips.  Still get comments on the looks of it.  Friends have been so impressed a few have purchased Vibes.  You won't be disappointed."
pontiac,vibe,2004,Pete, 01/06/2016,It's too bad they don't make them anymore,5,"Currently sitting at 240,000 miles. The only thing I've had done to the car is maintenance (oil, tune-up, tires, etc) and very minor repairs. By minor repairs, I've had to replace the driver door check arm twice (about $30 each time and easy to do myself), and the antenna recently broke, partly my fault by putting antenna balls on it. 

Other than that, this has seriously been a fantastic car. I bought it at 70k miles for $8000. I knew I wanted a vibe because it had everything Toyota for a GM price tag. It's taken me all over the country and has been the source of many happy memories. I couldn't be any happier with this car and would seriously consider getting another late model vibe or even a matrix when the time comes to replace it. At 240k I just want to see if I can make it another 240k, at this point I don't care to get another car because of how incredibly reliable this one has been"
pontiac,vibe,2004,SEP, 02/03/2018,Peppy little car,5,"This car is just fun to drive.  Even with a small engine, it gets out of the way when necessary.  Gas mileage is great, even in city driving.  It is my car of choice most of the time, even when I have a 'full' rear storage area.
"
pontiac,vibe,2004,Iheartmyvibe, 11/21/2008,Gerat Car!,5,"I purchased the car second hand, and I've only had it for a few months so far. I've only had to replace a sensor for the heater (inexpensive). It drives well, great gas mileage and it is fun to drive. It seems like a very reliable car. "
pontiac,vibe,2004,KennyG, 12/14/2008,175K Sold At auction for $3900,4,"Repo man took it at 175K.  Miss my Vibe. Drove like a tank. Changed the oil religiously, didnt burn a drop.  Can you imagine it sold at auction for $3900 with that kind of mileage?"
pontiac,vibe,2004,emilymode, 02/27/2009,"Versatile, reliable, affordable",5,I bought mine in July 2006 and have had no problems so far (except for the front window bolt recall replacement which GM took care of). I drove from New York to California with this car. I absolutely love my Vibe.   
pontiac,vibe,2004,wingman, 05/28/2009,OK Car,3,"Roomy for a smaller car. Has some nice amenities - lots of nice storage areas, regular electrical outlet, fold-flat front passenger seat. Has needed more repairs than I'd like. Has had on-going issues with the computer system and sensors going bad. Had to replace the wheel bearings early on. AC is now going bad. Transmission leaves much to be desired - does not perform well at highway speeds. This car works for 2 kids, but 3 car seats will not fit in the back."
pontiac,vibe,2004,RollaRiss, 10/09/2009,"like new at 103K miles, original brakes",4,"Our 5 speed manual Vibe has been absolutely trouble free, looks and drives like new. At 103,000 miles it still has the original brakes! Only replaced tires and wiper blades. The oil level tops the dipstick between changes at 3-5K, never added any. The original Continental Contac tires wore evenly to the wear bars at 30K but replacements wear fine. We use the 110 volt dash outlet all the time on trips to charge cell phones. Gas mileage good for such utility. Great highway car. Can be hard to hold back to 70 mph, seems to want to go 75-80. A great only car: economical and versatile. We still get compliments on its styling. The ride is taut, can be harsh on rough roads unloaded."
pontiac,vibe,2004,3ni, 12/26/2009,5spd,4,"All factory with aftermarket 19 inch bbs rims, rides nice kinda slow as compared to a 1.8 vtech honda, I have 310000 KM and it still runs smooth with no major problems eccept for that dam window!!!"
pontiac,vibe,2004,AMF, 03/01/2010,Miss my Vibe :(,4,"I got my 5 speed Vibe with 50K on it, only reason I got it was because it was a stick and got good MPG. After driving it 2.5 years I fell in love with it.  Got rid of it at 112K because my fiance is 6'3"" and there just isn't enough room for more than us in the car. Driving mostly alone I loved how I could reach EVERYTHING in the car with no problem.  Auto headlights were great but wish there was a way to turn them off certain times w/o parking break on. The previous owner had cut a cheap outdoor mat to fit in the rear which was a great idea, helped keep stuff in place. All the little compartments were great. Never broke down or needed repairs. If you're under 5'10"" you should love this car!"
pontiac,vibe,2004,rr, 06/30/2010,"Amazing even after 165,000 miles!",5,"Did a lot of research when I bought this car in 2004 new and could not have believed at that time that this would have been as amazing as it has been.  My daily driver for a long commute for the past 6  yrs and I still love it!  We have only replaced tires, oxygen sensor, AND it still has original brakes.  The most amazing car - can't say enough good about it.  Love how it drives, love the looks, versatility, everything.  It has become a good old friend and I shall keep it until it dies (which may be 450,000 miles+) but I seriously can't imagine a better car and I have a luxury SUV but still love this car!  "
pontiac,vibe,2004,khokoomj, 03/07/2011,Luv it unless I'm going up the hill,4,"bought my car brand new Sept. 03, went to the dealershop and specifically told the salesman what kind of vehicle I wanted. I got a sporty looking orange vibe, I luv it unless I am going up the hill and it starts to power out and I have to shift down, great on prairie roads.
Recently, there is a ticking sound and
had it inspected & changed different things I have been told might be wrong with it, but the ticking is still there.
A GM dealershop told me it might be the tranny but I have no problem shifting or anything like that or might be a rock inside the tranny, have had no other problems with it except its gutless.
I have been told it might be the purge valve so I will change it"
pontiac,vibe,2004,wolf-force, 07/31/2003,Great all around car.,4,"This is a great car! Not only does it 
look sharp, it drives as smooth as my 
last car;(a honda civic). They have a 
great selection of different colors. I 
got red lava. I get alot of complements 
on my car. The gas milage is pretty 
good too. It drives like a car but you 
sit up higher like in an suv. The only 
thing I would like changed is the 
windshield sun visor. The visor only 
comes down about 1/3 of the windshield. 
When I drive in the morning the sun 
comes strait in and I can't block out 
the sun. I just put my sun glasses on 
and I'm ok. I have only had it for a 
short time, so we will see about the 
reliability later. Go test drive one 
It's fun to drive."
pontiac,vibe,2004,Shannon Causey, 02/03/2004,Pontiac Vibe 2004,5,"My family purchased a 2004 Vibe in 
10/03.  We truly enjoy driving and 
riding in this vehicle. This little 
wagon has been fun to drive even though 
it is not a small coupe. The gas 
mileage has been great on the highway 
and in the city. "
pontiac,vibe,2004,Marcie Bakker, 02/23/2004,"Pontiac Vibe, front wheel drive",5,"I love this car! It has lots better 
fuel economy than an SUV yet I sit up 
higher than in a car. My car is 
comfortable and great looking. Handles 
well even in our recent snow and ice."
pontiac,vibe,2004,JOHN HAWKINS, 03/10/2006,Best inexpensive car ever owned,5,"I have driven this car for over 30,000 miles with not one problem...And it keeps going...I use only synthetic oil and change it every 7,000 miles..."
pontiac,vibe,2004,massimport, 04/21/2006,I've become a promoter,5,"I love this car and still love it after two years.  I bought it used (9000mi) and have doubled the mileage without a single problem; other than having to replace the mirror because of my own stupidity.  It has room for anything - I've loaded dressers, trees, moved an apartment, and more in this car.  Great gas mileage. Once this one gets to be too old, I'll buy another!"
pontiac,vibe,2004,Rsudik, 03/09/2004,Love it,5,"The gas milage is awesome.  I have 
averaged about 31 miles a gallon since 
I bought this car.  I drive about 400 
miles week, and with the growing gas 
prices it's a blessing.  The car is 
quiet, comfortable, unbelievably roomy 
and of course that gas milage.  This is 
the best car I have ever purchased."
pontiac,vibe,2004,Janet Adams, 07/06/2006,Love this car,5,"I purchased my Vibe when I was searching for an economical car with lots of cargo space. The Vibe is perfect.  It is a great 4-5 passenger car that converts to a practical station wagon. My vibe has gone thousands of miles carrying show dogs to competitions.  It has transported cargo as large as a screen door for my house, furniture and bales of hay.  After nearly 38,000 miles of in town and highway driving I still have never had a single problem with my Vibe. My best MPG was 37, but normally I get around 32-33 MPG on the highway.  Can't say enough good things about this car.  I just love it.  It is so well thought out.  Thanks Pontiac!"
pontiac,vibe,2004,justin-vh, 11/10/2004,Problematic car,2,"Unfortunately, this car has been very 
problematic for me.  Water leaks, Air 
Conditioner problems (noise and smell), 
many different rattles and squeaks in 
the car, damaged roof rack, missing 
some finishing details from the 
factory, like door stops.  Car wouldn't 
start the other day. I've only had the 
car for 6 months and bought it brand 
new.

What made my problems worse were the 
poor GM service reps.  One rep damaged 
the roof rack and interior when 
attempting to fix my problems.  Other 
dealers simply were not interested in 
trying to fix my car's problems, even 
when the problems could be reproduced 
in front of the service reps eyes.

Wishing I didn't buy this car...."
pontiac,vibe,2004,Vivi, 03/02/2006,Vivi,4,I love my Vibe. It is sleek and cute and I feel very comfortable behind the wheel. It is spacious but does not drive like a big car. The gas mileage is excellent.
pontiac,vibe,2004,Glenn Borden, 09/01/2006,The fun car to drive and own,4,"I have no complaints about the way the station wagon handles or the fuel economy, and I still get a lot of complements on its appearance. I still can't figure out why the dealership doesn't promote the Vibe.    "
pontiac,vibe,2004,Jason, 11/08/2006,Love it,4,"I love the Vibe.  I have own it for over a year.  I have not had any problems with it.  When we go on long trips we use the Vibe because of the fuel economy and the comfort.  We have made many trips to MI and Canada.  The acceleration is better than my partner's subaru and has surprized many of my passengers.  I have helped several people move using the Vibe.  I also do my own maintenance and have not had any problems changing oil, oil filter or anything else."
pontiac,vibe,2004,Kenny G, 11/28/2006,118K/2.5 years What a lucky pick,4,"As you can see by the miles, I work from my car.   While I wish I had a Cadillac for comfort, I use a pillow.  I only average 30/31 simply because I spend so much time idling on the phone.  So if my miles are any part of reality, I would imagine that engine hours wise has produced an additional 30% of use by simply idling.  The main reason why it idles so much is because of the one BIG flaw the car has - the headlights.  While I appreciate the safety involved with them, when the car is running with lights off and turn car off to ""accessory position"", the lights remain on. So its easy for the battery to die.  At 118K I would by another one. I think I tell you about that at 240K "
pontiac,vibe,2004,C. Moran, 12/15/2006,Great Cargo Area!,4,"Bought this car for its resale value / reliability, gas mileage and cargo space.  100% satisfaction with these features.  Bonus:  we got rear-ended at 45 mph and walked away from the totaled vehicle without a scratch..... we're going to buy another one."
pontiac,vibe,2004,wewans, 12/30/2006,Perfect small car,4,"86,000 miles, not one bit of trouble. change oil every 3,000 miles, runs like new"
pontiac,vibe,2004,John L, 04/17/2007,"Fun, economical ride",4,"A fun car to drive, very good gas mileage, 30 mpg in combination city/highway driving. 55,000 miles with no problems only routine maintenance. Interior is comfortable, lots of small storage compartments. One of which suffered a broken latch the first week and has remained broken- lots of plastic. A lot of interior storage space for carrying things, also the roof rack is handy."
pontiac,vibe,2004,Dave, 09/23/2007,Love It,5,I absolutely love my Vibe. The mileage is great and there is plenty of room for my family of three. You can't beat Toyota quality at a Pontiac price!
pontiac,vibe,2004,Richard Todd, 07/03/2007,Fantastic Salesman Car!,5,"This car is perfect for salesmen. The seats fold down so you have plenty of room to load things if you need it. Fuel economy at 65 MPH is 31 MPG. Also best of both worlds, Toyota drive train and engine, GM exterior and interior."
pontiac,vibe,2004,Macadew, 10/16/2007,Great Vibe,5,"Outstanding vehicle for the price. Gas mileage is excellent, car rides well and very comfortable in front seat. Surprising amount of room for rear seat passengers as well. Quality has been super outside and inside. Only negative is noise generated by engine. Besides that everything is great."
pontiac,vibe,2004,GAR, 11/01/2007,Excellent Car for Driving to Work,5,"This car is excellent for driving to work.  It uses very little gas, and has a flexible interior for hauling.  I can haul 8 ft. 2x4 lumber with the hatch shut!  I also haul bags of mulch, TVs, etc.  It's just a great little ""truck"" with car like mileage."
pontiac,vibe,2004,Ron Beeber, 11/01/2007,The Vibe is a Real Sleeper,4,"I'm just beginning my fifth year driving this Vibe. Very satisfied overall. Very comfortable (doesn't feel like I'm crouching in a ""catcher's position). Still 30 mpg. A bit noisy in cold weather start up until the engine warms. Surprising amount of pep cruising at highway speeds, but sluggish when merging onto a a freeway (that's the trade off one gets for the consistent 30 mpg fuel economy). Interior storage capacity is very adequate, and the seating/cargo configurations are very versatile. I change the oil/filter every 5K-7K miles and rotate the tires. I got 50K miles on the original set of Potenza tires, and bought the same tire as a replacement.  A wise choice."
pontiac,vibe,2004,joshhasavibe, 05/30/2013,"Drives and survives (Not AWD, base automatic trans)",4,"As a delivery driver for a certain ""freaky fast"" sandwich shop, this car is perfect. Tons of room in the back with the seats down, oodles of gas mileage, it's an all around great car for my job. Now, I'm 20, so naturally I'm gonna drive this car pretty hard. The car does kind of slug through first gear, but after that it takes off like a rocket. I often forget it's just a little 1.8L. I've had no major repairs at 104k, bought at 90k. Only really ""major"" things I've HAD to do are transmission fluid/filter. Other than that, this car's a little champ. Has a nice engine noise for being a 4cyl, nice torque, good suspension and cornering. Definitely a head turner when folks see it's just a Vibe."
pontiac,vibe,2004,Jennifer, 04/28/2008,My Vibe ROCK!!!,5,"I originally bought a 2003 Vibe the year they came out, and traded it for and 04 GT. This is the best car I have ever had. I have 125,000 miles on mine and have only put 1 set of brakes, 1 set of tires and a battery in my Vibe. This car ROCKS. I will drive it until the wheels fall off and get another one.   "
pontiac,vibe,2004,My Vibe, 04/20/2009,I love/hate my car,4,"I love my vibe, love everything about it but recently my car was making noises and when I took it in for its regular maintenance I was informed that the whole motor needed to be replaced, I maintenance this car every 3 months. The valves, timing belt tensioner, and the rod and barrings all needed to be replaced (so the whole motor). Everyone wants $4500.00 up to $6000.00 to replace this Toyota motor. I am highly upset with Pontiac about my car. Because I love everything about my car and now I have these problems, the car has  now 92k miles and I till owe $6k on the car. So I am out of a car and have to pay back $6k to the bank! I have 2 kids that I travel wi"
pontiac,vibe,2004,tigerfury007, 11/21/2014,"200,000 still going strong!!!",4,"My mother in 2004 needed a new car her old car was worn out and she is rough on cars. She test drove couple cars and fell in love with the pontiac vibe. She bought it brand new with 9 miles on it and in 2014 exactly 10 years later I write this review this car now has 211,000 miles still drives literally like its brand new aged very well awesome gas mileage and cheap to maintain!!! I recommend this car for anyone Toyota and GM made a good product toyota powertrain and motor and gm body. Since pontiac is dead now the vibe is still being made under the Toyota Matrix nameplate."
pontiac,vibe,2004,Marshall, 06/25/2006,My wife's car,4,"We bought this Vibe new in June '04. It's great for getting around town.  Mileage is disappointing, but the short drives, automatic, and high silouette come into play there. Quality of construction seems good except for thin exterior paint...what we have come to expect with clear coat finish I suppose."
pontiac,vibe,2004,Noah's Ark, 07/25/2007,Great gas mileage,4,"I have had this car for almost 4 years now.  We bought it before we had children, and two children and two dogs later, we have almost outgrown this car.  It handles well and has held up well being rear-ended once (no scratches even!)  Gas mileage is wonderful.  The sound system is great.  The driver's area adjusts well between my husband and me without a lot of moving things around.  It's a little slow in the acceleration, but manageable.  Overall, not a bad car, but a little small for family trips."
pontiac,vibe,2004,Darb232, 06/24/2007,A super car.,4,My wife drives this daily many miles. Has been very reliable. We had a little trouble with the stereo when we first got it. None since. The only other problem has benn brake rotors getting warped and making car shake at times. We have replaced rotors twice and pads three times. No other problems.
pontiac,vibe,2004,fladad, 05/15/2011,"From NEW to 106,000 miles..7yrs of FUN",5,"I now have 106k miles on the Vibe and I have
only replaced the tires and that was at 65,000 with the original Goodyear Eagle tires.
Still have
original brakes.
The VIBE
will cost less than its twin the Matrix and have the same reliability.

I think it was 2009 that they changed the engine with increased hp but less mpg.. I would rather have the better gas mileage and the design of the 2003-2008 body too.. Both the MAtrix and the Vibe are built on the Corolla platform, but I think the Vibe is more versitile.."
pontiac,vibe,2004,TTopper, 06/26/2004,Reformed VW Owner,3,"After years of owning and loving VW 
products, I decided to switch brands 
and try the Vibe.  With 3000 dollars in 
rebates, it made alot of sense.
I like the car well enough, but I am 
disappointed in a few things.  The 
plastic used in the cargo area is 
cheap, and marks up easily when 
loading.  The car has rattles in the 
dashboard already, and it's only a few 
months old.  The engine is buzzy, but 
powerful.  I also have noticed that 
it's hard to find the sweet spot on the 
clutch.  When the new Golf/Jetta come 
out in 2005, I may be switching back to 
VW's.  The Vibe hasn't everything I've 
come to expect from a car/daily 
transportation."

excellent for when you go camping or to 
the shore."
pontiac,vibe,2004,RRitter, 12/02/2003,My Vibe,4,"I got my Vibe a couple of months ago 
because of my my job requires me to 
drive alot. Great gas milage but the 
Vibe has one of the worst blind spots I 
have ever seen. If I had of known about 
this from the beginning I would not 
have bought it."
pontiac,vibe,2004,cef82, 12/23/2003,Sleeper,4,"Great car for the price.  Initial 
purchase was to have a commuter 
vehicle, but this car is so much more.  
Ride and comfort are fine.  Good gas 
mileage, avg 30 to 32 mpg.  
Acceleration could be better, but if 
you keep the rpm's up the car does 
fine.  Cruising at highway speeds and 
passing is not a problem.  The Vibe 
suits my needs right now, and I really 
like it."
pontiac,vibe,2004,jimirayguy, 12/27/2003,Great Vehile,4,"I needed a vehile with good gas mileage 
and power to drive on the expressway. 
After looking at many vehiles, I found 
the Pontiac Vibe to be the best. 
Without spending $25,000 or more. Fun 
car to drive, handles good and mileage 
avg. is 26.7 mpg."
pontiac,vibe,2004,P.Crew, 12/31/2003,The Anti-SUV,4,"As a family on the go and requiring an 
economical and functional car, we have 
hit the nail squarely on the head.  The 
combination of price, breeding (Toyota 
thru-and-thru), economy, and comfort 
are staggering in today's market.  The 
car sits just high enough to afford a 
good view, without being rude to other 
drivers.  While performance is 
moderate, it is exceptional for the 34 
mpg we actually get in combined 
driving.  At 6'3"" I am very comfortable 
in this wonderful car.  The lone gripe 
is that the angle of the top of the 
doors gives a somewhat ""distorted"" feel 
when looking over your shoulder or 
using mirrors to change lanes or back 
up."
pontiac,vibe,2004,mbkano , 01/02/2004,Fantastic car,5,"I have never been a big fan of 4 
cylinder cars but the Vibe has a nice 
smooth ride.  It also has good pick 
up.  I especially like the good gas 
mileage.  It's very comfortable on 
long trips.  The Vibe has so much 
cargo space and yet it's a small car.  
I would recommend it to anyone. "
pontiac,vibe,2004,JaeMaeJar, 01/03/2004,The Perfect Vehicle,5,"The Pontiac Vibe is a great vehicle for 
anyone.  It has enough room for a 
family to travel in it together and it 
is also small enough so if your driving 
by yourself you don't feel as though 
your driving a boat.  It is the perfect 
vehicle falling between a car and a 
SUV.  It is wonderful for the college 
student having to drive back and forth 
to school. A definite have for anyone."

the 3 Greyhound dogs that we have.  "
pontiac,vibe,2004,McMandolin, 01/17/2004,The Toyota that thinks its a Pontiac,4,"For a tall person like me who wants 
good gas mileage and isn't so concerned 
about acceleration, this is the perfect 
vehicle.  It has extra headroom and 
seats at the right level for easy 
ingress/egress.  Many have commented on 
the red lighted instruments."
pontiac,vibe,2004,doc science, 03/24/2004,Terrific Sport Utility Wagon (SUW),4,"Vehicle came with few flaws in its 
build/design.  Engine noise is greater 
than expected and there is vibration 
from engine revs that are felt  
accelerating, But,t does not deter me 
from loving this car's looks, handling, 
safety, comfort and fuel economy. I now 
have 3400 miles on it. City mpg's = 24-
25 & 33.8 highway. No way you'll get 
the posted 29 mpg's in town. Interior 
is nice, seats give great back support 
on long rides and everything 
is ""ergonomically correct"".  Visibility 
is very good. This vehicle is much 
roomier/bigger inside that one would 
imagine looking at it from the 
outside.  I give this vehicle 2 thumbs 
up because it does it all."

pontiac,vibe,2004,salukilover, 07/09/2003,Good Vibes,4,"I've wanted this car every since the 
first brochure came out. I've found my 
hatch remote unavailable and the middle 
compartment will not stay closed.  It 
is made of cheap plastic and will not 
stay latched.  To the dealer I go in 
less than 2 months to get the remote 
reprogrammed and the plastic 
compartment fixed. I drive 80 miles in 
a day and wanted an economical car. I 
fill up every 3 - 4 days because of the 
small tank and I don't drive 55. My 
paint is already chipping from the 
rocks.  Suggestion: Get the clear coat 
put on your new car. I'm still happy 
with my vibe.  It is fun to drive and 
with having dogs, the hard plastic in 
the back is awesome!"
pontiac,vibe,2004,gmgirl, 07/07/2008,Best Pontiac Yet,4,"bought this Vibe new and just hitting 100K.I have no real complaints. Great fuel mileage, GREAT cargo space, sharp interior, its got the Toyota guts with the Pontiac price tag!!!I am an avid Pontiac buyer, and this is by far the best Pontiac I've had. I love it. I use mine like its a truck sometimes, hauling everything from dishwashers, landscaping rocks, to building lumber. Can't beat it for its use and fuel mileage. Terrific vehicle! I guess one complaint would be that I have to get my tires rotated about every 3K miles because the weight distribution of the car is off and causes ""cupping"" of the rear tires. I get free rotation, so I don't care too much. I would definitely buy another!"
pontiac,vibe,2004,Bruce B., 08/03/2008,Good car,4,The Pontiac Vibe /Toyota is a very reliable and economical vehicle. It's a great substitute for a small SUV. Amazingly I average 38 mpg on mostly rural driving and 40.3 mpg on a few 200 mile trips. I was only expecting 33-36 mpg. A great commuter car.
pontiac,vibe,2004,Fabulosa, 08/13/2008,Great car!,5,"I have nothing negative to say about my wonderful Vibe,I do housecleaning for a leaving and this car have been excellent for my business, I recommend everyone to buy this vehicle. Money well invested."
pontiac,vibe,2004,Carcully, 08/14/2008,Best of all worlds,5,"We recently sold our 2003 Honda Odyssey, and replaced it with a 2004 Vibe.  I'm thrilled with our choice.  We have two young children, but really didn't want to drove a large van around any longer, partly because of rising gas prices, and also because the van became a holding ground for extra items we really didn't need to be using.  The Vibe is perfect for us.  It still has the ability to haul things if needed, has a decent-sized back seat for a small car, but has much improved gas mileage, ease of handling and parking, and is equally as comfortable.  It is also a sharp looking car, and it sits you up nicely for a good view of the road. If something ever happened to mine, I'd buy another!"
pontiac,vibe,2004,Good to Go, 08/20/2008,Fun to Drive,4,"I love this car! I compare it to the Subaru Outback because of its versatility. I've only had it two weeks but I can tell the gas mileage is great. Only problem I've come across is putting gas in the tank. The pump constantly shuts off like its full even when I just start pumping. Very annoying, takes 10 minutes to fill tank. Anyone else have this issue? I checked on recalls or campaigns and found none. Other than that, great car."
pontiac,vibe,2004,wm, 09/28/2008,"5 years, no problems",4,"I purchased in Dec 2003, and nearly 5 yrs later I still love this car.  It is incredibly functional, durable, and reliable.  I have had ZERO mechanical/maintenance problems with it.  My only complaint is the sheet metal for the exterior is easily dented - expect to see some dings on the bodies of older models.  I am proud to say I just made a long distance drive on the freeway with the cruise control set at 65, and got more than 33 miles/gal.  At 58,000 miles I'm just changing the tires.  She still looks good, and is the perfect car for a dog owner/family man like me."
pontiac,vibe,2004,Gary, 10/17/2008,Good Value - but questions remain,4,"Great Gas Mileage. Fun Car to drive. Fits smaller people like a glove. Some quirks that seem not to make sense such as Headlights always on(Can not be turned off at any time), Front windows recall(mine were fixed under warranty before recall), Front of car including hood chips very easily, and most nagging for me is the fan in the car is always on(air comes through vents constantly). These things get noticed after newness of car wears off!"
pontiac,vibe,2004,mayonnaise, 10/20/2008,Awesome car!,5,"Love, love, love this car!  Bought used just over a year ago. Gets great gas mileage. Very comfortable seating. Very roomy & lots of space for passengers or to haul cargo."
pontiac,vibe,2004,Bobbydrums67, 11/09/2008,Could not believe the room,5,"Did not think I would own one till I drove one. I am a old 67 yrs old drummer. I have a 7 piece drum kit. They are fit on this Vibe. I am still amazed, I am 6ft 4in tall and i have plenty of head room, leg room, etc. Truly amazed. Wife is a rural mail carrier. With 4 bolts taken out the center console can be removed and if she needs a back up vehicle this little but big Vibe will do well. 37 MPG, great ride. We own 2 Hondas also, A CRV and an Odyssey. Would buy another Vibe in a heart beat. Same as the Toyota Matrix. Wife's sister owns a Matrix. That's what got me started looking into this vehicle. She lives in New Orleans, she visited us this year. She got 35 MPG easy on her trip to Indiana."
pontiac,vibe,2004,Blue belle vibe, 11/12/2008,Good Viberations,4,We rented a Vibe for a weekend trip in 2004 because that's all they had left. My wife would not let me drive the car the whole trip she loved it so much. We bought a leftover model when we got back and got a great deal. She commutes about 45 miles a day and has not complained a bit. The car has tons of room and gets about 32 mpg. We camp a lot so the plastic back hatch area makes for easy cleanup. The roof racks are very useful and solid and we use them for our 2 kayaks. The back seat is roomy even for my football player son. I've replaced the brakes once and change the oil every 3000 miles. The car has 65500 mostly hiway miles. Hopefully they keep making these when we'll be ready for the next one.
pontiac,vibe,2004,Howie Adams, 04/04/2009,Great value and safe at that,4,My wife just totaled her Vibe after having for a few years.  We owned from 20k to 82k miles.  We had to change brakes and one set of tires...nothing else.  Overall it had a nice sporty look and was comfortable to make long 1000 mile trips.  I would highly recommend.  Car was hit very hard in front and no scratches to driver.  I wouldn't have thought of as safe as car as it is.  Going out to buy another
pontiac,vibe,2004,themrfreeze, 04/02/2010,A *great* car,4,"I loved my '04 Vibe.  Rock solid reliable, versatile and roomy interior, enjoyable to drive on long trips.  I could haul loads of 8-foot lumber or big bulky items in the back.  Car was easy to work on as well, though all I ever needed to do it was rotate tires and change the oil.  Got wrecked in '09, and I still miss it. "
pontiac,vibe,2004,leslie, 02/22/2008,Love it,5,"Bought this car new and have absolutely loved it - no problems except needing a relay switch replaced shortly after purchasing (fell under warranty and towing).

Great get up and go and excellent fuel mileage"

once the back seats are folded down so 
I move all my stuff pretty easily.  
I've been really impressed with the 
gas mileage I get, and the Vibe has a 
sporty feel to it.  Its a very 
practical car on paper, but it also 
looks great on the road.  All my 
friends think its a great looking 
car.  I just graduated from college 
and I think it has everything I want 
(in terms of features, safety, gas

price.  "

The car ride is solid,verry quite for 
the most part. The gas usage is great.
The color's offered is out of site it's 
hard to choose. The interior options is 
great, with all the options that is  
offered their is nothing to want for.
I get a new auto about every 18 month

It handles well, although you have to 
pay attention at highway speeds.  The 
6-speed gearbox is tight and it shifts 
easily. I have NAV, and the CD Changer

the supercharger will allow me that.  
Let's get on GM.  Get it to the public.

is an awesome car!  It is roomy enough 
for 2 adults and 2 car seats, with room 
for luggage or something for a trip.  
There are alot of extra features, such 
as a desk or a storage bin for the 
hatch (which with 2 small children I 
will be purchasing soon!)  The chrome 
on the inside is what sold me though! 
Like the song says, ""Her favorite color 
is chrome."" Until now, chrome was not 
important to me, but I LOVE IT!  I 
would never buy another car again!"

millage and expensive repairs I 
switched to the Vibe GT.
Still able to pull my jet ski, haul 4 
bikes in the hitch and still get close 
to 30 mpg even at 80 mph.  Does loose a 
bit of speed up the hills down south, 
but a quick downshift to 5th and kept 
up with friends in there vans and 
suv's.  Only difference is it was under 
$20.00 to fill my tank and we all went 
around 300 miles to a tank of gas."
pontiac,vibe,2004,kscot3, 08/10/2003,Enticed,4,"I was a very happy VW driver but we 
needed more room without a huge new 
monthly payment (new dad).  The Vibe 
fit all our stuff and still has room to 
spare.  Better fuel economy was a plus 
and the little things like a roof rack 
and storage spaces everywhere helped 
make this decision easy.  Also, safety 
ratings and recommendations from the 
web and Consumer Reports were what we 
wanted to hear.  The Vibe handles well 
and offers a lot of car for a fair 
price."
pontiac,vibe,2004,Beth, 08/12/2003,A Dream to drive!,4,"This is a great car. I keep finding 
things that I love about it.  Moonroof, 
hidden power supply, 115-volt outlet.  
The elevated seats make 
visibility great, and there is lots of 
room for backseat passengers.  Though 
one must make frequent trips for 
gasoline due to the 12 gallon tank, it 
is a dream to drive, and makes you look 
forward to your next trip.  Very 
comfortable and versatile with tons of 
room for everything you'll take with 
you (including roof rack if you can't 
fit everything inside!).  "

pontiac,vibe,2004,hmiwb, 09/18/2003,No Problem,4,"I'm very pleased with my Vibe and have 
had absolutely no problems with it so 
far (6500 miles).  The fuel economy has 
been excellent, consistently in the low 
to mid 30s and the comfort and 
drivability (5 speed) have been great, 
no squeeks, rattles or things falling 
off at all.  I owned a Toyota/GM mix 
before as a Geo Prism and had excellent 
service from it.  I believe I will 
enjoy this car even more and expect 
that the reliability will be there as 
well due to the Toyota influence."
pontiac,vibe,2004,John Yeh, 09/21/2003,no BMW but solid economy car,4,"Good, reliable car. Very good gas 
mileage and plenty of space inside for 
a small car. With a Toyota Corolla 
drivetrain, it'll be reliable.

Wish it had better handling, similar to 
Mazda Protege, but I bought it because 
it was more thrifty fuel-wise and had a 
bigger interior. It'll never be a BMW 
but for an unrich guy like me it was a 
good buy.

The interior is fun and the stereo 
sounds good. As a recording engineer, I 
always test my mixes in the car. Plus 
having that extra space with the fold-
down rear seats, I can carry a rack of 
equipment while still having kid-
carrying flexibility that I didn't have 
in my two seat pickup. "
pontiac,vibe,2004,llcutejoe, 12/02/2004,No Problems,4,"I bought my Vibe used with 20000 miles on it.  Used it for moving, it was great for the trip.  Taken several long trips and been stuck in traffic for hours.  The seats remain comfortable.  Gas mileage about what I expected, slightly below EPA ratings in city.  Automatic is very smooth and well matched to the engine.  Base radio is only ok."

cheaper than toyota's matrix and looks
better to boot.  My only problem is that
the manual shifter is loose, going to
replace it with an after market one
anyway so no real complaints."
pontiac,vibe,2004,IndianaMe, 10/04/2003,Review of my Pontiac Vibe,4,"Absolutely love it! Very economical & 
fun to drive. Has great acceleration & 
power for 4 cylinder automobile. Always 
had pontiacs & even though this vehicle 
is partial Toyota wouldn't hesitate 
buying it, again. Was prior all USA 
made buyer."
pontiac,vibe,2004,phillygal1964, 10/04/2003,"04 Vibe, 1.8 ltr,4 cyl, auto.",4,"Car's appearance small and deceiving.  
Must view from inside out. 
Spacious/lots of compartments/storage. 
Have cargo mat/nets in your deal. 
Shadow color hardly shows road dirt. 
Stay clear from Monotone.  Road
particles can easily chip the paint. 
Sporty lit dashboard electronics. 
Sporty steering wheel.  You can rest
your left foot on a foot rest while
driving.  Car sluggish at first until in
second gear.  No highway passing woes. 
Great gas mileage 29 city mpg and 34
highway mpg.  Overall, great car for the
money with a SUV feel.       "

space for odds and ends.  "
pontiac,vibe,2004,Vulcanrider01, 10/08/2003,AWESOME,4,"This car has it all. I purchased the 
Base Vibe with the bells and whistles 
attached. Have had a lot of compliments 
on this car. My family only owns GM 
products and this one by far is the 
coolest. TONS of room with the foldable 
seats. Confortable ride with speed when 
you need it. A+++ I LOVE IT!!!"
pontiac,vibe,2004,aesmith, 10/13/2003,Great Fun!,4,"This car is alot of fun to drive. It 
is quite a bit roomier than it looks 
from the outside. The fact that the 
entir rear of the car turns into one 
large cargo area is probably the best 
feature. As far as performance goes, 
it would be hard to find a car that 
performs better in a small, tight, and 
fun to drive package."
pontiac,vibe,2004,SoCal Greg, 10/14/2003,No Jive in my Vibe,4,"Fell in love with the Vibe AWD in the 
showroom.  Bought it after a test drive 
and have had no regrets.  It's a head 
turner and generates considerable 
comments from people in parking lots 
who want to know more about it.  

Forget the PT Cruiser - the Vibe is 
what's happening!

Seats are a little uncomfortable on 
long trips but otherwise it's ideal for 
us.  "
pontiac,vibe,2004,sailordad, 02/13/2005,"After 2 years, still lovin it.",4,"Wanted a vehicle with good mileage, space for kids, utility, and fun to drive.  I'm a product designer, an intelligent, stlish product is important.  I also care about good value, long term cost, and enviromental impact.  The Vibe has been a great little car, fun to drive, easy and cheap to own. After 2 years of pretty hard driving (40k miles - I used to have a BMW 530i), It still feels tight.  My kids call it the zippy car, compared to the Explorer we had."

would be automatic wash and wax."
pontiac,vibe,2004,nysign, 02/26/2005,Excellent Value,5,"We bought the Vibe a year ago, but waited until now for a review.  The car is perfect!  Wait, almost perfect: the side view mirrors could be a bit bigger.  The car has AWD, Side Airbags, Moonroof and fancy radio - all the bells and whistles.  And it didn't cost an arm and a leg.  Seats are more comfortable than our Infiniti.  This winter we outfitted the car with studded snow tires: we're invincible in the snow! Would I buy another of these?  In a heartbeat!  But it will probably be a while because the car acts as though it will last forever.  Want one? They're so reasonable, you might as well buy one new.  Just a great car."
pontiac,vibe,2004,dpitts6719, 10/25/2003,Vibe,5,"I have taken it to Florida from North 
Carolina twice since I bought my Vibe 
and have gotten great gas mileage--
33/35 mpg highway, Every where I get 
people wanting to know if it is a 
minivan a station wagon or an suv. I 
just tell them its a mini-suv. everyone 
loves it and most would like to own 
one. I love the idea of not having to 
crawl in and out of it like a small car 
or step up high like an suv. I have 
hauled a heavy-duty storm door without 
the back door open. I simply popped the 
backglass open and it hung out about 2"" 
laying flat. I can seat 3 large people 
in the back seat without them being 
crowded. My friends like that. I LOVE 
MY VIBE"
pontiac,vibe,2004,Shammie, 10/25/2003,I love my Vibe!!!,5,"I love this car! I've owned hondas for 
25 years, but after 9/11, I figured I'd 
buy something more American. This car 
not only looks great, it is totally 
functional, comfortable, and practical. 
And it's just the right height for me 
and my elderly mother to get into  - no 
more climbing up out of a hole!"
pontiac,vibe,2004,Helene Jacobson, 03/25/2005,Vibes for you,5,"It's a peppy smart looking car that is a cross between an SUV and a wagon. It handles smoothly on straight aways as well road construction surfaces. Great front window view. The back hatch door can be opened fully with remote or just the window can be open if you just want to put small bags in.This car is very roomy and seats 5 people very comfortable. Has great back seat leg room for tall people. This car does have roadside service coverage which hopefully I'll never have to check out,but at least it's available. This car also has a great sound system.CDs play and sound like you're listening live. Free oil changes every 3 months is a great incentive also."

it. its roomy, comfortable seats 
awesome moon roof and stereo. It has

smooth."
pontiac,vibe,2004,CHThom, 10/22/2003,Vibe time,4,"Great ride and great looks.  
Lots of head room and leg room for 
passengers but for a tall driver, 
the ""dead pedal"" for the left foot is 
annoying and forces my foot into an 
uncomfortable position.  Long rides are 
sometimes a chore because of this 
arrangement.
Lots of cargo space and the rear window 
opening is fantastic for loading & 
unloading groceries.   
All in all, I would buy this vehicle 
again without hesitation.  
I just wish that they would get rid of 
that ""dead pedal"".......
 "
pontiac,vibe,2004,IBSALY, 10/22/2003,The Best Car YET!!!,5,"The Vibe is the best purchase that we 
have ever made.  It is fun to drive, 
awesome to haul small stuff, and how 
cool is it that the back seats fold 
down FLUSH with the trunk to make for 
easy hauling of larger items.  I would 
recommend this vehicle to anyone 
looking for a well-priced, economical, 
reliable vehicle that stands out from 
the rest out there!"
pontiac,vibe,2004,Paul Camp, 11/05/2003,My Vibe,5,"I love my Vibe. That may sound strange 
for a man to say, but I do! I love the 
way it drives, looks , and how it 
handles on the road. But most of all I 
like the fact that I don't have to stop 
and gas it up all the time. A tank of 
gas in this car seems to go forever. 
I also think that the Vibe is a people 
friendly car. The other day I pulled up 
to the Bank at the same time as another 
Vibe owner. Before I could get out of 
my Vibe a woman in her Vibe called out 
to me and said ""nice Vibe. How do you 
like it?"""
pontiac,vibe,2004,aponas, 11/05/2003,Pontiac Vibe 2003,4,"It's perfomance is good.  Takes to the 
road well.  The design is a new mod- 
look. Handling is good. The only dis-
like is the hub-caps make a terrible 
noise when driving over turtles, which 
is embarssing. Espically when we have 
guests in the car."
pontiac,vibe,2004,CliffSTane, 11/05/2003,What a great car,5,"I've had this vehicle for six months 
now and have been very pleased with 
it.  I drive 25 miles to work everyday 
so I already have close to 14,000 miles 
on it, and the car hasn't missed a 
beat.  After a few oil changes already, 
the vehicle has been getting very good 
gas mileage on the highway as well in 
the city."

pontiac,vibe,2004,John Logan, 05/12/2005,Theres something about it ?,4," I always was attracted to the ""look"" of the Vibe and theres still something about it that attracts me. After one year and 23,400 miles I have to say its a good little car. The gas mileage is good, traveling with 2 adults and 2 kids is comfortable. Its nice to see a American car company offering a somewhat affordable common sense little car thats reliable and sporty as well as functional. Even though its a Toyota at heart, which certainly isn't a bad thing !  better looking than Matrix..."
pontiac,vibe,2004,Joan , 11/19/2003,Everyone should drive this fun car,5,"I love my Vibe it has great gas

got the fusion color and I love it.  
The dash is great at night.  Very roomy

being small but I haven't noticed it at 
all Its so much fun to drive."

gotten 45 miles per gllon on a trip. We 
drove a 650 mile trip comfortably. I 
love my vibe is not a speed demon but 
has great peck up and is very

wife drives 50 miles a day back and 
forth to work in it and feels secure. 
One plus it has a very reliable toyota

to come."

recommend it to anyone!!!!"
pontiac,vibe,2004,Elizabeth P., 12/04/2003,The Best Car Ever,5,"I love my vibe!  The moon and tunes 
package have made it a fun ride.  The 
high rise seats are comfortable and the 
interior and exterior are sleek but 
sporty.  Even without options the vibe 
is a good deal as much of the standard 
package is well-rounded.  I love the 
versatility of this vehicle.  You can 
move stuff inside and on top and the 
seating is roomy.  It's like an SUV but 
smaller and more practical.  It's also 
easier to park. "
pontiac,vibe,2004,djemterry, 12/12/2003,"The ""car"" of the future",4,"Not really a car, suv or wagon, it's a 
great combination of all three. This is 
what ""cars"" should be like in the 
future--durable, good fuel economy, 
roomy, comfortable, stylish, practical, 
and flexible.  You can feel and see 
Toyota quality, but also enjoy 
Pontiac's sporty styling (much better 
than frumpy-looking Matrix) especially 
with the gray body cladding instead of 
the more expensive and easy to 
scratch/chip body-color sides."

We have had no problems whatsoever, in 
fact we liked it so much that we bought 
another one (not awd) this december. We 
have always had a large car (cadillac)
but we felt the difference in the ride 
was far outweighed by the convenience 
of our Vibes!!!"

comfortable (I have back problems 7 
disc surgeries) the seating fits me 
exceptionally well I am 6 ft tall, 224 
lbs with a large build.

My wife and i took the Vibe to New 
Hampshire this year and we got 31.5 mpg 
on the highway and 29 mpg around North 
Conway.

The car is a dream to drive, it handles 
well, and most of all it's an absolute 
BLAST to drive.  Can't say enough good 
things about it."

better quality & practicality. Was 
going for Vibe Gt until saw in manual 
it requires premium fuel -for an 
economy car? Six foor two and is plenty 
comfortable. Narrow rear wheel wells 
allow alot to be carried flat. With 
snow tires,fine in snow. 2004 guages in 
white & orange better than 2003's all 
orange ones. I give it a solid 
recommendation. "
pontiac,vibe,2004,nummiace, 12/23/2003,BEST OVERALL VALUE,4,"I first saw this vehichle nearly two 
years ago at my place of employment. I 
didn't like the way it looked. But I 
was forced to work with thousands of 
these cars over several months.(Yes, I 
build them.) I slowly became very fond 
of the appearance, and I couldn't 
believe that this AWD car got 30 MPG! 
I know I may sound biased, but I don't 
think that there is a better value in 
this price range. It is essentially a 
Corolla drive-train in a flashier, 
roomier package; a great combination 
of reliability and functionality. I am 
also well over 6 feet tall and have 
plenty of room for myself, wife and 
two car seats."

a car in years. It amazes me the pick

can't beat the gas mileage. If you

the mark but it's really just another 
small car to me.  It's noisy and has a 
constant vibration.  There are too many 
blind spots.  I drive a 
large delivery truck and can manuever 
it better in traffic.  The passenger 
side seat in narrower than the drivers 
side and squeezes you. Problems 
including a CD player skipping and the 
air conditioning quiting.  It has an AC 
outlet but only the smallest of plugs 
will fit because of the cover cap.  We 
needed a new key and it took the dealer 
25 minutes to program the auto lock 
system with it."

on getting rid of my sunfire because I 
loved it, but when I saw the new Vibe I 
fell in love with it and drove it home 
that afternoon. And my husband and I

Lookad at Matrix but not the same 
bargain and so much uglier in a blah 
way.
Toyota engine tends to drone on though 
at least has some pep.All that's 
unknown is long term reliability but so 
far it's ahead of my previous Nissan

just about perfect.Anyway ,buy one ,you 
won't be sorry."
pontiac,vibe,2004,watts1371, 09/26/2005,Good 2 Go,4,"I bought my Abyss Vibe back in Feb. 04. Previously I was driving a Dodge Dakota, but wanted a little more room. I wasn't really aware of the Vibe until I started looking for a trade-in. I fell in love with it, and bought it even though it cost more than my truck. It has great styling, very functional, gorgeous interior, and great gas mileage. The performance can be enhanced easily if you want to spend a few bucks. I put Eibach Sportline lowering springs on it and it now sits about 2 inches lower and handles even better than stock. I also put a Magnaflow exhaust which makes it sound a little bit more aggresive."

sometimes.
Great gas mileage (30.2 mpg for 1st 
3600 miles)  Wheel doesn't tilt enough 
& I can't move the seat closer w/o 
bumping my knee. It is a lot of fun & 
the moons & tunes pkg. is a kick; but I

all that room and gas going out the 
tailpipe, so looked into smaller 
SUVs. Many are so-so on gas 
mileage, so started researching 
these ""crossover"" vehicles and 
discovered the Vibe. Went right out,

of room, this is like a mini-suv.  You 
sit up high: the window sills and roof 
height are the same as my toyota

Great styling, I think it's better 
looking than the matrix.  "
pontiac,vibe,2004,Molly LaMar, 01/22/2004,I Love My Vibe!!!,4,"Purchased the Vibe in June of 2002.  
I love the sleek style.  It is very 
affordable, and the gas mileage is 
great.  We don't travel long distances 
often, but it is great for small trips.  
The electrical outlet is a wonderful 
feature with children.  They can play 
their games without wearing down 
tons of batteries.  My only complaint 
is the smell it makes when it is cold 
outside.  It smells like rotten eggs, 
but once the engine heats up it goes 
away.  We have had this checked, but 
there is no apparent problem.  It only 
does this in the colder weather.  
Otherwise, it is a great car and I 
strongly recommend it!"

my Corolla, because my back was killing
me if I had to drive a long distance
(2hrs or more). Now my back is grateful
because the seats are very supportive
and the ride is comfortable and
quiet!(Driving the Corolla was like
driving a beer can!) The Vibe is bigger,
carries more stuff (so much so that my
huband want his next car to be a Vibe

planning on getting. Thank you Pontiac
for  bringing back the pride in driving
an American Car! "
pontiac,vibe,2004,bootknife, 01/22/2004,2004 Vibe,4,"We like the roomy interior, and the 
flexibility to set the seating in many 
different ways.  We have the 17 inch 
tires and the handling is superb, 
however it does need more power.  I 
understand a turbo is going to be

bought it in April. I loved it up until 
the snow started to fall. This car has 
terrible performance in snowy/icy 
conditions. Has anyone else experienced 
this? There is another gentleman who I 
work with and he feels the same way 
about his vibe. I have never owned a 
Pontiac before, and by far this is the 
worst car I have ever driven in the

Vibe is not for you. However, if you're 
looking for a vehicle that offers 
excellent performance with versatile 
interior design, above-average cargo

of get-out-of-the-way power from a 
small engine, as well as good gas 
mileage at a great price.... then the

pontiac,vibe,2004,Barry, 11/16/2005,Wife loves her vibe.,5,This is my second Vibe.  My wife does most of the driving.  She gets 37 mpg. Her Vibe is the only thing around the house she does not complain about.
pontiac,vibe,2004,Ken Garcia, 12/09/2005,Tough to Beat,4,"The nature of my work is driving. I drove more than most.  Much more.  My care turned 79K today, 18 months after my purchase.  I keep trying to find a grass is greener on the other side car.  Yes, an Audi and BMW certainly spell greater success to a prospect. A cady is certainly more luxurious, and a Subaru has a better ride.  However, No other Auto provides the Stereo, gas mileage, handling, ease of operation, cheap to keep, sunroof, parking ease and ample room for five for a two hour drive than this car.  Its so hard to beat and I have driven numerous.  I keep trying to find better and simply havent been able to do it at this price point NOT CLOSE!!!"
pontiac,vibe,2004,jon, 12/30/2005,"nothing is perfect, although this is close",4,"GM needs to really get some younger engineers to design their vehicles or get new ones.This vehicle is made at the same plant which builds Toyota Matrix (which I like alot more than this cars outside design) I purchased this vehicle for the GM staple and show American car loyalty (please dont laugh, What loyalty?) Very versatile,  functional, and fun to drive, no problems and car is 2 years old. Only regular maintenance and I would give this car a 10 but nothing is perfect."
pontiac,vibe,2004,goodvibe, 01/30/2004,love this car,5,"I bought this car after owning a 2002 
Audi A4 which turned out to be a 
lemon.  I will never buy another 
VW/Audi product again!  Vibe's have 
great looks,(better looking than the 
Toyota Matrix)performance, fuel 
economy, versatility and room.  This 
car is smooth and quiet on the freeway 
and peppy around town.  Passing power 
is good even with the 4spd automatic 
which my Vibe has.  The moon and tunes 
package is great too, with excellent 
sound quality from the stereo.  With 
more standard features than the Toyota 
Matrix, just as good reliability, and 
coupled with the rebates from GM, Vibes 
are by far the better choice of the two."
pontiac,vibe,2004,Millster, 01/31/2004,Simple Truth,5,"The 2004 Pontiac Vibe is a good choice 
with today's gas prices and the rising 
cost of automobiles. It's looks are a 
bit deceiving because the interior 
spaciousness is huge even though the 
outside looks small. I'm 6'4"" and 215 
and I am very comfortable when driving 
the vehicle and needless to say, it is 
easy on gas with 30 plus city and 40 
plus highway. For 20 thousand dollars 
it can't be beat."

pontiac,vibe,2004,Peebles, 02/03/2004,Econohustler,4,"I got a bargain, $10,900 for the base 
vehicle with 400 miles. So far I have 
averaged 29 mpg combined hwy and city 
(900 miles on the odometer to date). 
While acceleration is not blazing, 
only sports cars beat me at traffic 
lights, and only if they are ready. 
The steering is crisp (no power) and 
gives good feedback (a touch torque 
steer). The ride is smoother than I 
expected, but I previously drove a 
truck :)"
pontiac,vibe,2004,Brock Bell, 01/08/2006,Vibe is great,5,"I knew I wanted a Toyota, but didn't like the style of the Matrix. The car has style, comfort, ease of use, dependability, and great gas mileage. I have averaged 27 mpg with mostly city driving on 89 octane 10 pct ethanol unleaded fuel and 31-33 on highway trips over 300 miles. I would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone and to purchase without the XM satellite radio option would be foolish. I certainly hope that Pontiac considers keeping this vehicle in their arsenal as well as keeping up the great work on this vehicle with Toyota. I look forward to, and hope, that the planned Toyota redesign of this car (in 2007) continues through to the Pontiac as well. Good luck with you VIBE."

Pontiac Vibe can compliment my family 
when where dressed up or just cruisin

this car can turn heads!  I love the 
retro look of the interior (i.e., love 
the circular vents and chrome display). 
What a fun car to drive!  The interior 
is also surprisingly practical and 
spacious.  You also cannot go wrong at 
33mpg on the highway.  This car also

during front end collision tests."

Originally i was in the market looking at Honda's or Toyota's... but one drive in the Vibe, and I was hooked! This car has everything, from a style that doesn't make you feel like it's a Wagon. Everyone who has driven with me, are like, ""WOW! we might consider getting this car too."" It has it all, style, comfort, extra little perks, and a smooth ride, but doesn't break your piggy bank. I love that it has Toyota parts under the hood, & the interior of the car is Exactly! like that of the Matrix, which my friend owns. Now after having this car, a Honda or Toyota just look boring! I'm glad I got this instead!"

somewhat.  The build quality seems 
quite excellent. No deterioration at 
all in brakes,suspension,engine,trim.

months. Have driven it from California 
to Maryland in three days, and from 
Maryland to Georgia and back. Have 
driven in ice (no problem) and wind 
(gets blown around a little more than a 
civic but less than an SUV). Great for 
short trips with 4-5 people or long 
trips / lots of luggage with 2 people 
because the cargo area isn't all that 
big but the back seat folds completely 
flat to make a huge storage area. Very 
comfortable on long trips; plenty of 
room in the back seat, even for men. 
Driver sits relatively high, giving 
them a good view of the road. Quiet

pontiac,vibe,2005,bmore2rutgers, 11/06/2011,Always there,4,"I'm sad to say, that my Vibe AWD was totaled a few weeks ago when someone ran into me.
The 2005 Vibe AWD was in my family since coming off the production line.
We kept up with regular maintenance, and can only remember it being in the shop once for a rear output bearing leaking.
The vehicle was great, and very very dependable(toyota powertrain).
It lacked some pep when getting on the highway, but other than that handled great.
I remember taking it through two foot of snow, and well... it made it without getting stuck. I'll miss the car.
I most likely won't look to buy another one, because I felt the interior was put together a little cheaply. "
pontiac,vibe,2005,bridgettg, 04/22/2011,So- So vibe,3,"I have mixed feelings about my Vibe because there are a lot of good that go with owning a vibe...gas mileage, lots of storage, comfortable. But the things I don't like about my Vibe are....air cond./ heater are very weak, doesn't have a lot of power, Rear vision is poor. I would definitely take these things into consideration. "
pontiac,vibe,2005,shamgar, 01/16/2012,Wonderful car,4,"Bought this car new based on research into cars that got good mileage.
We are extremely happy with it.
Current mileage is about 65000 and the car has been dead reliable.
It has a five-speed and since teaching my daughter to drive stick I now have to fight her for the car when I need it.
Great fun to drive, loads of room for cargo.
The only negatives are esthetics.
It's not terribly comfortable on long drives and the low profile tires are extremely noisy especially on freeway expansion joints.
Now that Pontiac is gone, I would buy a Toyota Matrix without hesitation."

I have been impressed with it's comfort, roadability, and it's handling. I'm a big guy and I fit in it like a glove. My only ""gripe"" would be the fact that there is a lot of plastic in the interior and it makes it more noisy than I would like.

Bought 2005 used in 2011, I have no Idea how many miles on it, but like the 2004, just do routine maintenance based on months, not on milage, runs great.  Both paid for, and insurance is relatively inexpensive, so it's a win-win. Sure interior is a little cheaply made, more road and engine noise than desirable, stock radio is garbage, annoying high revving when engine is cold...overall, never lets us down. And since I take care of these, I know who worked on them and what was done to them so I can sleep at night. If you can find one in good shape, it's worth the value.

Hers now has 50K, mine is 73K.  Only repairs to either was a warranty replacement of power brake booster at 2K, and a set of tires at 30K, debris from road construction.  Have topped 36.5 mpg on I-77, and normally get 29-30 mpg in town.  Only complaints are the location of the radio antenna and that it is hard to read the instruments during the day.  I use the cruise a lot, because it likes to run fast.  Had it up to 94 once to keep up with traffic, and still had plenty of pedal left.  I think it could easily top 110.

I've used this car for sooooo many things, hauling just about anything I could fit in it (cake deliveries, landscaping materials, home improvement materials, furniture ect...).

Well any misgivings have vanished. WE LOVE THIS MACHINE! Great handling (love the AWD in our snowy NY winters), good gas mileage for a AWD (average of 31 with the top mileage @ 36 on the open road, around 26-28 intown) and most of all flawless reliability of this sistership to the Toyota Matrix. Although the ride is a little bumpy compared to the pillowy ride of our sedan it is amazing how we can drive this car 14 hours to the Myrtle beach without tiring. The car is sufficiently peppy in power although don't challenge any Hemi's!"
pontiac,vibe,2005,Trudy Case, 06/07/2006,My opinions after 9 months of ownership,4,"Style-AWD wagon Overall a very nice car that fits our needs perfectly. The cargo area is very useful for hauling 50# bags of horse feed, camping and fishing gear,groceries,etc.AWD really comes in handy in the winter. we live in the mountains of PA.and the roads are not very level or straight around here. During our 1st snow storm this past winter, I just had to take it out to see how well it run in the snow. No problem! Roads were snow covered, but never spun a wheel going uphill or from a stop. Handled very well on curves and going downhill. It just wouldn't slide with the anti-lock brakes. Very good gas mileage. Many useful interior features. Don't like buzzy engine noise."

I drive frequently for my job and transport children so this car is perfect for me and has NEVER let me down. Besides regular maintenance, I've had one actual repair (plastic casing around a/c vent was rattling) and one optional upgrade (I decided to get a new radio installed because the factory model has no bluetooth/aux capability). Besides that it handles great, amazing MPG, and I am genuinely looking forward to driving this thing until the engine bottoms out at 400,000. And it was a fairly inexpensive used car at $8000!

pontiac,vibe,2005,Morris N, 07/19/2010,"Solid, Reliable, Affordable",4,"We've had our Vibe for 5 years, and my wife drives it primarily around to & from work. The AWD is marvelous in the winter on packed snow & ice; much better than simply a front wheel drive vehicle. Mechanically, it's solid. Interior is adequate for 4 adults, or 2 adults & 3 kids. I'm 6'2"" and I have plenty of headroom and leg room. The 4 cylinder engine has to work going up hills when in cruise, but the transmission shifts down and maintains speed. Still, I can't complain when we still get 25-28 mpg on the road with an AWD. It's a great package for the price, especially if you do winter driving."
pontiac,vibe,2005,Rob, 07/27/2005,Zippy Vibe,4,"I found the standard Vibe with automatic transmission to be very zippy around town as well as the freeway. City fuel milage varies from 24 to 29mpg depending on traffic and stop lights. I like the wide wheelbase and the way it hugs the road and the curves reminisant of the 60's, a Pontiac trait. Ilove this Vibe as it passes the gas stations, not like other vehicles that outweigh it and waste's fuel. The Vibe is an all around zippy fun vehicle; its the answer to todays gas prices. I look forward to driving  the Vibe to Monterey, and up to Oregon, and Washington, i know it will get looks and stares, it always does."
pontiac,vibe,2005,missina, 03/15/2006,awsome car!,4,"I was looking at the 06' vibe and found that I could get more for my money by getting an 05' even if it was used. This car drives wonderfully for me, although my only thing aganst it is that part of the roof rack was stolen off my car and it was way to easy for the person to take it (all they needed was a flat head screw driver) and now I can't find the part to replace it and the dealership said that we can ""talk"" about it."

The  car is great (I did research on Edmunds.com before finalizing my decision) and so versatile! One time we had to drive over 1200 late at night to go ""rescue"" my mom and dad, and since I had just worked all day- my husband put a blow up mattress in the back and I slept the whole way!
The only problems I have had with it is the interior lighting system inside is not totally working correctly. The drivers seat is not the most comfortable for going long distances (I've gone some long distances in this car!), but overall...it's been a great car for me! "

pontiac,vibe,2005,Ed, 11/13/2010,It Doesn't Get Better with Age,3,I purchased this car new and put about 8500 miles a year on it.  It isn't a bad car with lots a major mechanical problems but it just isn't a great car. The radio face shows up in red and can't be seen very well during the daylight hours.  Also had LED light go out on radio.  GM wanted $350 to replace so went to Best Buys and got by cheaper.  I also use a pillow on the console armrest as it is too low for arm to fit comfortably without leaning to the right.
pontiac,vibe,2005,Briana Sutherland, 08/14/2015,Vibbin',4,"I just got my new 2005 Pontiac Vibe today and I have fallen in love! The size is perfect for a first car and I have done much research on this car and it seems to be fairly cheap on gas and to maintain! Plus for me since I am only 19! I absolutely love the look  of this car! The only this I would change about the interior is get a new radio whit an aux cord, since I like to listen to music through my phone. But other then that, the inside of the car is in mint condition, even being 10 years old! There is a lot of run and it runs great! Buying my Pontiac at 182,000 it's defiantly still running great! The only complaint I have is that once I hit 60 mph on the highway, the steering wheel was shaking. Could this just be a tire issue? Does anyone have or had this problem? Getting this checked out today and will update post once problem is fixed!

pontiac,vibe,2005,Mark Joseph Gallagher Jr., 03/10/2016,Two Bales of alfalfa,4,"The Vibe has a lot of storage space.  I like the fact that it can fit five people, and the fact that I can put down the back seats and fit two bales of alfafa in the back.  The hard plastic in the back makes it easy to sweep.  The only thing I do not like is the five speed manual transmission has some weakness at aroung 200.,000, but maybe my expectations are two high. I get more than 40 mpg if I drive 55 mph, and 33 combined if I drive faster.

pontiac,vibe,2005,Roadrunner, 03/10/2009,Still Going!,4,"Though this car is only an '05, it has many hard miles on it.  It just hit 145k.  Never had it to the dealership, never a problem!  Just normal things you have to maintain.  Still has original battery.  Had brakes replaced last summer.  Hit a deer and help up VERY well, hardly could notice any damage.  I love this car.  It's unreal what you can pack into this thing!  Nice storage areas inside, lots of space and very roomy & comfy!  The fold down flat seats make it nice for putting just about anything in it.  I think it's a very sharp looking car.  Had it over a year before I actually realized it was a station wagon.  Mine is a 5spd and gets great gas mileage.  145k & still going strong!"

I live in Colorado, drive up mtn passes all the time.. plenty of power and great in the snow (not sure what the other person was saying down below).. typically get 30 mpg in mixed driving, close to 40 on the hwy only. Its so much bigger than it looks, can put my mtn bike inside without taking off the front wheel. I like the clearance as well, helps in the snow and offroad"
pontiac,vibe,2005,Joeytdietz, 04/02/2010,Great Family Car,4,"We have had this car for 3 1/2 years.  We have kept pretty good care of it with oil changes every 3000 miles.  Transmission fluid tends to run dark, not sure if this is a common problem with Vibes.  No major repairs.  We did have a computer replaced recently (at 82,000) after the check engine light came on.  That cost us $600.  Glad it wasn't a transmission problem because they can run about $3000 in this car.  The car has lots of room for our family of four and being that it is a 4 cylinder it gets great gas mileage (32 mpg freeway) for a car its size."
pontiac,vibe,2005,jk, 12/02/2010,PCM,4,"I had the Power control Module replaced in May 2010 and when I questioned the recall that just came out, I was advised that I should not have paid for the PCM since it was under a warranty put in place by the government and I received a full refund.  Check into it if you have also had the PCM replaced and your Vibe is not over 8 years old"

pontiac,vibe,2005,Viber, 05/21/2005,A good choice,4,"I just got my new Vibe after selling my Prizm. It is great! At this time with gas over $2, this was the only one that give reasonable mileage and the nice SUV feel. The Toyota engineering makes it an easy pick and this has the better styling than Matrix.Of course I got tons of incentives too, making it a bang for the buck. Lots of cool features. I love the cluster gauges and lighting. Really nice looking and practical interior. I can't really complain about the power because my prizm was about the same range. This seems to have good handling. Only concern I have at this time is - the suspension seems to be rigid. My Prizm handled bumps much much better. Overall, it makes you a proud owner!"

I just want it to die so I can justify buying a different vehicle.  This car will forever haunt my dreams and aspirations just because it knows I hate it.  It drives like a cheap POS, its super uncomfortable, yet it's economical with a highway mpg of 31 with me driving it like a bat out of hell for the last 14 years, and it has only cost about $1k in maintenance over the last 10 years, and I.....hate....the....car.

pontiac,vibe,2005,greywolf855, 02/08/2006,2005 VIBE,4,Fun car and economical. I traded a full size Dodge club cab to save on gas. The vibe gets over three times the milage of my old truck. It has plenty of power for everyday driving and some fun too. The shifter is a little stiff and it goes into 2nd and 3rd gear somewhat hard. Quick shifts occasionally end up in gear grinding. The vibe will save you money over the matrix with dealer incentives that toyota does not offer. Plus its styling is better that the matrix's.

Excellent gas mileage.  Can't really think about anything bad to say other than it should come with a rear mat standard as groceries tend to slide around on the plastic rear floor.  We bought 2 huge tote bags that have divided areas which really helped.  Car has plenty of head room and is easy to get in and out of.  It has tilt wheel but a telescoping steering wheel would be helpful.  We are very happy with the Vibe.  "

No mechancial or body problems after 3500 miles.  The interior is nice and seats are comfortable, but many of the interior surfaces are hard and cheap feeling.  The hard arm rests are not too comfortable.  Ride and handling is good in the city and on the highway/expressway. Overall, it is a good car for the money spent.     "

I am a stay at home mom who is never at home.  I put 30,000 miles on my Vibe last year, and I don't know how I would have been able to afford the gas if I was driving the SUV.  We love this car.  "

Two years, 90K miles and no mechanical issues yet; however, the original Continental tires didn't make it pass 20K and the original paint job is the worst I've ever experienced.  But, the lil car is averaging about 34/35 mpg on the highway.  The ride is not so bad, perhaps a lil loud and a lil slow on the initial pickup or for passing, but enough.  Seats are firm and comfortable.  And, I'm sure I could mention lots of other things.  Overall, I am pleased with it for what I bought it for:  a comfortable, affordable, practical and easy on the gas lil commuting vehicle (I commute 150 a day)..."

Mostly routine maintenance, oil, tires, brakes, etc. Did replace front wheel bearings and the alternator, but parts are cheap and it is reasonably easy to work on. It does leak a little oil, a few drops overnight, but who cares it has over 361,000 miles.The car is very versatile, back seats fold flat for a large cargo area.

Its hip, cool, socially responsible, very usable, easy to handle and park, quick, and makes me proud to own it. Here in Michigan, a great car must get great traction in ice and snow. My Vibe does! Our summers are long and beautiful; a prolonged heat wave is not uncommon. My Vibe's A/C unit pumps out gobs of super cool air even when its 95F w/95% humidity. I opted for the Moons & Tunes package, with a great moonroof and a surprisingly powerful concert quality AM/FM/CD stereo that cranks! It's safe with belts, airbags, 4 pillar side panels, & excellent visibility/maneuverability. It's interior is so flexible; I can carry almost anything. My Vibe makes me feel like a kid again!"

Not great...although many people love them."

But we love our Vibe for the most part.  We looked at the Matrix but went with the Vibe because it looks better, has better stereo (even with the standard system) and roof rails.  The 2005 didn't include cross bars so we paid extra for them so we could put stuff on top. There was a problem with intermitent hard/extended starting and GM issued a service bulletin.  We took it to three different dealerships to get it fixed but they wouldn't do anything about it until we got lucky and the hard start happened with the service rep.  GM is really bad about warranty service.  Next time we'll go with Toyota."

I have two dogs that I drive and need my car to move. I'm on the road a lot. I also needed something that would be good on gas. I wanted a new car but those were too much for me right now.

I want to drive this car for 200,000 miles, like I did with my 1990 Honda Civic. The Vibe consistently gets good mileage, has been nearly maintenance free for the first 50,000 miles, and still looks great. It seems slow when it's loaded with 4 large passengers and going up a hill at 55 mph, but I can punch the accelerator and it will suck more gas and move right up the hill. "

pontiac,vibe,2005,2005Vibe, 02/14/2005,Great Value,5,"I purchased the '05 Vibe loaded w/auto trans. I looked @ all the cars in this class including Matrix. For those of you who do not know, the Vibe has a the same Toyota engine & drive train the Matrix has. It was a joint venture between Pontiac & Toyota. You can buy the Vibe a lot cheaper than the Matrix. I average 32.8 MPG city/hwy. Try it, You'll like it! I do. No Complaints."
pontiac,vibe,2005,fyoung5, 02/26/2005,Love It/Hate It,4,"This car is so much fun to drive. I love the space inside and the way it sits higher that the average car, and has plenty of space for a car seat.  Having said that, the very best gas milage I have ever gotten is 31 mpg, and that was entiely highway at just under 70.  I don't drive conservatively in the city, which is why the 20 - 25 mpg city didn't bother me, but it is nowhere near the 30/36 advertised.  It also is horrible in the snow. I have lived in upstate NY all my life and snow has never bothed me. I am going to buy snow tires this weekend and hope it helps.  All in all I like the car, but have had a lot of disappointments."

I'm thinking about buying the supercharger/gm product..or the k and n cold air intake system,you will get more hp and torque..i'm always comming up with excuses to drive it...i'm hooked."
pontiac,vibe,2005,Melissa, 03/01/2005,Great Car!,5,"Fun to drive and very practical.  I wasn't wanting to pay $30,000+ for a full size SUV - this fuel efficient car makes for plenty of space.  Feels very safe and solid."
pontiac,vibe,2005,Lori, 03/31/2005,My little suv,4,"I was looking for a suv type vehicle, and saw a vib on the pontiac dealership lot by accident. I loved the looks of it, and when I found out it was made with Toyota i bought it. I love this little car. It sits upright, plenty of room, and very little wind noise. I recently drove it from Arkansas to Birmingham, Alabama, and got around 34 to 35 mpg runny at 60 to 70 mph. I never had any problems passing by just using common sense. I was very pleased with everything about it. The one thing that I did notice that bothered me at first, was the first time I turned on the AC around town. I noticed the pull of it on the motor, but after I got used to it it was no big deal.  Paid $16,400"
pontiac,vibe,2005,jody, 04/08/2005,This is the most fun car I've ever had!,4,"I have had my Vibe for about 9 months now. My gas mileage is great and I haven't had to do anything but change the oil. It handles very well and everything works very smoothly. I feel like it is very quick for a 4 cylinder. I also like the higher seating position. I can fit a lot of cargo in the back with the seats folded down. I love the look of the dash and interior. The exterior styling is great also. I have gotten compliments on my car at the drive up at the bank, car wash, etc. All in all, this is a very cool versatile vehicle."
pontiac,vibe,2005,Emily, 04/11/2005,"Fun, Practical , & Different !",4,"I had a 1991 Honda Civic Hatch & was ready for my first new car. I knew I wanted a hatch and something distinctive rather than the generic looks of the civic & focus. The Vibe is a fun travel car but practical for  the weekly trip to the grocery store ! Bright Chromatic dials, Cybercloth seating, and a high view of the highway. I don't feel like I'm being looked down upon by all the passing SUVs! "
pontiac,vibe,2005,Steve, 04/15/2005,Needed instead of Wanting,4,"Got a very economical car in this era of rising gas prices.  I got a great price for everything that came on this Vibe.  Anyone needing an inexpensive car that is inexpensive to run then check out the Vibe.  I went with the FWD instead of the AWD.  I drove both, about the same feel supposedly a little better mileage with the FWD. Lots of head and leg room.  I'm 6'2  and there is 6=7inches of headroom to spare."
pontiac,vibe,2005,Scott, 04/17/2005,Great Car,5,"Great car for the money.  Fun to drive, great on gas, and a sharp looking little car. I was out the door for just over $18K, with the navigation system and 6 disc CD player."
pontiac,vibe,2005,ART, 04/28/2005,Good & bad,3,"Great fuel milage 29 to 32 city and 40+ hwy,too many rattles,safety concern, when emergency braking shoe is applied to brake and gas pedal at same time so car can't stop safely. I've had two very close calls. Shoe size is 10 d. Very uncomfortable to drive on long trips."
pontiac,vibe,2005,RJA, 04/28/2005,I was Wowwed!,4,"By looking at the car from afar, I was not impressed.  But when I got in it and drove it, I was Wowwed!  I love it, its alot of fun, great mileage, easy to handle, and a great looking small car."
pontiac,vibe,2005,Mark, 04/28/2005,The perfect car!,5,"I bought my first Vibe when they first came out in 2002 and after 36000 miles it has been flawless.  Last year when my wife needed a car, we carefully considered Camry, Accord, Mazda 6 and Jetta but endded up getting another Vibe.  I'm perplexed by Edmunds luke warm review, while Jetta gets a glowing review??  The Jetta's interrior and trunk is cramped compared to the Vibe, and the Vibe has better steering response and a far better base engine (I didn't want turbocharged).  Edmunds says the Vibe is not ""sporty"", but I find it nimble and crisp, on par with import sport coups.  The larger Camry and even Accord is not as nimble, but the Vibe has just as much interrior room. "
pontiac,vibe,2005,Michael Dinsdale, 05/01/2005,Great car to travel across America!!,5,"We have had this car for about 3 weeks , and Love it!!!  the fuel economy is way better than what was put on the sticker.It drives really well on the highway and in town. We are very pleased with our choice of this type of suv."
pontiac,vibe,2005,Fun Car, 05/16/2005,Fun to Drive Great on Gas,4,"The Vibe is a great little car its fun to drive has a smart sporty look, and is great on gas milage. The large wheel base gives is a great ride and good handling. Its a soild tight car. "
pontiac,vibe,2005,Driz, 05/17/2005,buy one of these!!!,5,"I love my vibe!  After driving a variety of vehicles from SUV's to compacts the vibe is the best of both worlds.  The fuel economy of a compact and the interior room of a small SUV, not to mention the feeling of sitting higer than any car I have ever driven.  The vibe is fun sporty and on average $1500-2000 less than his Toyota brother. Top that off with the availability of On-Star and you have a real winner in this zippy wagon."
pontiac,vibe,2005,Kristin, 05/27/2005,"Pontiac Vibe, a good fuel-economy car",4,"This car really surprised me. I loved the design but was weary of how the performance was going to be. When I got in the car to my surprise the little 4 cylinder engine really has some spark to it and allows for good acceleration. The car is light and this makes the body and the engine fit perfectly and the fuel-economy is way above what I was used to. The interior is of course not as roomy as I would have liked it to be, but the hatch back has a lot of room and the seats will fold down to make a great deal of room which was excellent when I was moving stuff to another city. The interior is also very sporty and the seats comfortable. On the negative, the silver exterior paint chips easily."
pontiac,vibe,2005,fladad, 06/11/2005,"12,000 mile review",5,"I have had my Vibe since OCT and now have 12000 miles. Not one mechanical problem yet. The upgraded stereo-Moons and Tunes-sounds great. The car is nimble and quick for only 130hp. At 65- 70mph I get a true 34mpg with auto transmission. It feels bigger when inside than it really is. Unless you have GM card points and OLDs loyalty rebate, it makes more sense to buy a used one with 10-12k miles for about 12- 13000 dollars. "
pontiac,vibe,2005,JAKE, 06/28/2005,Don't even think about getting one!,2,"The car is just plain poorly made.  Great at the dealership and first 1,000 miles.  After that, it's all a sad story.  The car changed and the interior started to fall apart.  There is a leak that won't go away and the seat now feels like a bag of potatos! I am VERY disappointed in this GM offering and now see why the car was so cheap.  Any manufacturer that offers ""employee pricing"" is in deep trouble.  I dislike this car so much, I took it back and paid a small fortune to get out of it and into another car.  Do yourself a favor, don't even bother with this vehicle."
pontiac,vibe,2005,curtchester, 07/11/2005,Santa Barbara Vibe,5,"Initially, a problem with car wandering under all road conditions. After replacing Continental tires, problem solved IF front tire pressure 38 and rear 36. Now handles perfect with neutral steering. Otherwise, absolutely no complaints."
pontiac,vibe,2005,Plat2005Vibe, 07/25/2005,Buy This Car,4," I bought my Vibe a few months ago and I love it.  It is an Automatic, with ""Moon & Tunes"", Power group, aluminum wheels, and black leather interior. Average gas mileage is 28 city, 35 highway. Current miles: 2560.  I compared this with serveral other cars and this was the most that I could get for my money.  A similarly equipped Matrix would have cost me over $3000 more.  Fit and finish are pretty good.  The car feels solid and is surprisingly quiet inside.  It maneuvers well in traffic and brakes well.  For those who had problems with the car ""falling apart"", maybe they are a bit too rough on it.  I find it to be well made.  Very versatile and economical!"
pontiac,vibe,2005,Sara, 08/13/2005,Love my vibe!,5,"Just got my new Fusion Orange Vibe and I LOVE it. Almost bought at Matrix, dealer got a little nasty when we said we were going to look at the Vibe. Saw my baby on the Lot and I was hooked, got a great deal with the moons & toons and on-star package already in car. Didn't think I cared about the moon roof but now I love it. Smooth drive, seems to get great mileage, love the wide front window, great viewing area (compared to my old Jimmy). Just FUN to drive at 52 years old, feel like a kid with my first car!!"
pontiac,vibe,2005,Debbie, 08/17/2005,My Vibe saved my life,4,"My parents bought me a new 2005 Vibe On May 25,2005. I was in a terrible accident August 9, 2005  My car was hit in the drivers door by another car going 40-45mph  the force of the impact pushed my car across the street and into a pole.  I got out of my car and walked away from the accident with only a sprained neck and a bruised shoulder...my passenger was unhurt. My car was totaled by the insurance company with over $13,000 worth of damage. I bought the Vibe because I loved how it looks but the 5 star safety rating was the reason my parents wanted me to get this car and I am alive today because of it. I am buying another Vibe this week."
pontiac,vibe,2005,lovethevibe, 08/25/2005,great vibrations,5,"we have been very pleased with the vibe. we have two young kids and the vibe handles our family needs very well.  flexible and roomy and very fuel effiecient - especially on hwy.  the compact size makes the vehicle easy to park and maneuver in the city, but the vehicle rides solidly on the hwy.  love the sporty styling. it's a great- looking vehicle that still is useful for family.  entry and egress is very good."

Since purchasing my AWD Vibe in April of this year, I've put 14,000 miles on her without any problems -- most of the miles on the interstates... but I've also taken The Vibe off-road in the sand, rocks, washes and gullies of the Sonora Desert; crossed over the Rockies three times; and zipped down unimproved roads through several National Forests.  Vibe's peppy performance is adequate without being special.  P.S.  I'm 6' tall and weigh 250 lbs, but The Vibe comfortably fits me, plus my luggage and equipment bags, and has room to spare.  "
pontiac,vibe,2005,leonard shoemaker, 08/30/2005,acceleration,4,"must be careful when starting from a dead stop. with front end being so light, car has tendency to lose traction. must watch when on stones, dirt or wet road."
pontiac,vibe,2005,MSR, 09/11/2005,Fun car!,4,"I purchased my brand new '05 Vibe about a week ago. I was looking for a ""family car"" that had plenty of room, a great safety review, and a reliable build. The Vibe has all that, and is also a blast to drive. It's utilitarian.. there's plenty of room for all your stuff, and the rear seats fold down to give you a huge amount of cargo room. It's also a gas sipper, mine gets about 29/34 mpg on regular gas.. a plus with the insane fuel prices right now. It also features a Toyota engine and drivetrain. Much of the car is designed by Toyota, and it shares many parts with its ""sister"" auto, the Toyota Matrix. There were a lot of nice options included for the price too, it was a great overall value."
pontiac,vibe,2005,Frank, 09/13/2005,A Toyota in a GM skin,5,"People contemplating getting a Toyota Matrix should buy the Vibe instead.  It is assembled in California by union members (Matrix is non-union).  It's a lovely car which sparks a lot of interest, is fun to drive, is very utilitarian, and has great gas mileage. Fit and finish are great. Standard stereo sound system is fine as well.  Should retain its value, especially with gas at over $3/gal."
pontiac,vibe,2005,Aime Nitsch, 09/28/2005,I am absolutley happy,4,"I love my Vibe. Lots of Pros....love the seats. Comfort! The arm rest is way to low though. I get no use out of it and I am only 5'5"". The moons and tunes package is a must. Makes it more sporty. I absolutley HATE the beeping that goes on for 2 minutes when I put the car into drive without having my seatbelt on. I understand the safety of it though. And make sure you get a mat for the back end. The ""durable"" plastic gets scratched very easy. I love everything else about it. The vents cool design. All the seats fold down. The current temp. I also wish that Audio controls were offered on the steering wheel. But its a GREAT bye!"
pontiac,vibe,2005,Ross, 09/27/2005,Very Vibe Happy,4,I am very happy after getting rid of my gas guzzling Isuzu Rodeo. Very roomy for all my camping/mountain biking gear. Comfortable for 4 adults if needed. Great mileage for such a roomy vehicle. Feels very solid. Winter diving performance remains to be seen. The GM incentives/pricing made this a no brainer.
pontiac,vibe,2005,Larry, 11/06/2005,Vibe vs. Outback,4,"I can most accurately compare this car to the '01 Subaru Outback wagon I traded in. I traded because of the General's various incentives, a variety of research (including Edmunds), proven Toyota drivetrain reliability vs. a growing concern about websites featuring major head gasket issues in 98-02 2.5 liter engines on Soobs, and having a car with a good trade-in value.   The Subaru was quieter, was a tad more stable in winds, and seemed to have a bit more room.   Other than that, the Vibe is probably more reliable, has better mileage (both are AWD), butt-level seating (good for bad backs and visibility), great Moon and Tunes stereo, and equal power because the Vibe has a ""smarter"" tranny."
pontiac,vibe,2005,weatherman3, 01/05/2006,It's a toyota with GM pricing,5,"this car works because it's a toyota, the design is all japanese and that's a great thing. luckily, pontiac actually improved over the matrix styling and mines really hot. I have the base auto salsa with the sports package and 17 inch alloys. the extra spoilers on the back are unique and really add to the body kit. i also have the moon and tunes pkg with abs and black interior. the vehicle is really sporty looking and handles well with the big wheels. the best part of this deal was the gm employee pricing plus i haggled an additional 1300 off that, which deducted about 5000 off msrp. got great financing too."
pontiac,vibe,2005,MATT, 01/10/2006,great car,4,Love this little station wagon great on gas very comfortable drivers seat. love the sunroof. no trouble yet and ive owned it for a year and a half.

pontiac,vibe,2005,jstant01, 04/05/2006,Good Little Car,4,"My Vibe is a good little car. I downsized in mid-2005 when gas reached $3.00 per gallon. It gets good gas mileage, is fun to drive, and is very roomy for such a small vehicle. The back seat is HUGE. My only problems have been some rattles in the dash and an ongoing ""starting"" issue. It doesn't like to fire up right away when the engine is warm. Other than that, no real problems. Great car!"
pontiac,vibe,2005,Mike, 06/14/2006,Love my Vibe!,4,"I got my Vibe in June of 2005.  Since I bought it, I have loved driving it since day 1.  I usually get bored with a car 6-12 months after owning it.  Everyday I can't wait to drive it because it is just fun to drive.  It's a peppy 4-cylinder with good pickup and a smooth ride.  There is a little bit of road noise but that is because of the design...which I love.  It has a great look and the interior is great.  I travel a lot and the interior space is great, more than meets the eye."

everything about it!! Other than that, 
I wouldn't change a thing!  It's the 
most FUN car I've ever owned and I

bought it off of is looking for a

corners, the straight-a-ways, on-ramps, 
off-ramps(braking), are all fun to do. 
The only problem I have had, was snow. 
The engine is an all aluminum engine 
and doesn't do to hot in the snow. But 
other than that, the car is quick off 
the line. Kinda sluggish in the low end 
torque area, but when you hit 6000rpm 
all the way to 8k, hold on. Gas mileage 
is good also. Driving from Virginia to 
Minnesota, you have to cross through 
the mountains, which I might add is a 
blast, I still get great gas mileage. I 
never want to get stuck someone in the 
boondocks of West Virginia and in the

I have a five speed and get between 
33.5-35.5 mpg. doing mostly highway 
driving around 65-70 mph.
It hugs the road around corners, is 
very quiet on the highway (Goodyear 
Eagle GT tires) and runs circles 
around both my Honda CRV's.
This is essentially a Toyota Matrix 
with a Pontiac Vibe nameplate. "
pontiac,vibe,2005,Brandon C, 10/15/2004,Great Car!,4,"I needed someting to replace my 1993
Grand Am and wanted something versatile.
 The Vibe came along just in time as I
am an exclusive Pontiac owner.  My Vibe
is just the right size and handles much
better than most other cars its class. 
So far I have averaged about 33.5 MPG
split with city/hwy driving.  The Toyota
engine is a good selling point. 
Overall, the Vibe is the best value
considering its size, fuel economy,
horsepower, etc.  Best of all, it's a
Pontiac!"
pontiac,vibe,2005,joe mc, 10/16/2004,Fun car...quality build,5,"Only 500 miles, but already I love it.
Easy to get in and out of. Moonroof 
and tunes package is great.  Corners 
well, and ABS brakes.  Trunk area is 
easy to access with no lip to lift 
over.  Day time running lights and 
automatic headlights. All of this with 
a Toyota engine and transmission."
pontiac,vibe,2005,Rubbie123, 10/29/2004,Great First Car,5,"My parents bought me a Pontiac Vibe as 
my first car. I've been driving it for 
about a year now and I must say that I 
love it. It's very safe and really easy 
to handle. It's a very zippy car and 
parking is a breeze with it. I highly 
reccommend the Vibe if you want a 
quality car that's both economnical and 
hip."
pontiac,vibe,2005,Hawkybaby, 11/13/2004,Love my Vibe,4,"I just got my Vibe about 2 weeks ago 
and it is a dream!  It is a 2005 and 
is pretty loaded.  I got the 
monochrome color package in the Fusion 
color scheme.  It looks awesome and 
turns a lot of heads."
pontiac,vibe,2005,Chief1995, 11/28/2004,Great Vehicle for the Money!,5,"This car is a fun vehicle to drive and 
is easy on the pocketbook (average 33 
MPG city).  This coupled with the 
Toyota design elements and reliablility 
make this vehicle a great purchase.  
The vehicle has storage capability that 
is not available with the standard 
sedan.  You either have to sacrifice gas 
milage or storage.  All in all, I have 
enjoyed my vehicle and look forward to 
driving it every day.  The XM satallite 
radio is a significant plus when 
traveling in areas with limited 
traditional FM/AM coverage.  "
pontiac,vibe,2005,toadster, 12/07/2004,Love it!!,5,"I bought the Vibe just before
Thanksgiving and have put 400 miles on
it. Was looking for a car that's
practical, reliable, and economical to
replace my 1992 Sentra. The Vibe fit the
bill perfectly. The only options I
wanted were automatic transmission,
monochrome package, and power
windows/locks. Since all of the
mechanicals are Toyota, reliability
should be great. Lots of headroom,
legroom (for a small car), and storage.
 High seats make it easy to get in and
out. The drive is smooth and quiet once
up to speed. Engine is ""buzzy"" under
acceleration but the automatic
transmission shifts smoothly. Body style
is sporty and the new nose keeps it from
looking like a small Aztec. "
pontiac,vibe,2005,spark, 12/10/2004,Overpriced Econobox,3,"Once the novelty of the car wears off 
you start to notice the harsh ride poor 
cornering and all the squeaks and 
rattles.  The car is difficult if not 
impossible to get like trans fluid ($12 
a quart, filter not available)filters 
etc.  Poor fuel economy for its size 
about 29 mpg highway and has poor 
acceleration.  The car is about $4500 
overpriced.  Tires are are extremely 
expensive due to being high performance 
(why????) as the only ones that fit and 
wear very fast. "

like the styling and all the options.  
Some people do not like the luggage 
rack but I think that it makes the car 
look sporty.  I was surprised that the 
05 Vibe does not come with cross bars 
on the luggage rack.  I was not willing 
to pay extra for that.  "
pontiac,vibe,2005,Jason, 12/20/2004,Great Value,4,"I had an Olds Alero that gave me 
nothing but trouble (In the shop over 
15 times in 3 years...all covered under 
warranty, but unaccepatble).  I looked 
to the Toyota Matrix for quality, more 
room and better gas mileage.  The fact 
the Vibe has a Toyota pedigree was the 
strongest selling point.  I was 
primarily looking for the Matrix, but a 
pre-owned loaded Vibe with only 7000 
miles came across me so I jumped at 
it.  The car's design is top notch and 
the build quality impressive.  It 
corners well and accerlartion is better 
than I thought it would be.  You have 
to know going into buying that it's not 
a hot rod, but there is plenty of power 
for everyday driving.  Gas mileage is 
icing on the cake."
pontiac,vibe,2005,Bob, 01/15/2005,Great overall car,5,"Although this car's acceleration isn't as great as a sports car its other features overtake this small detail. Its very fun to drive, very roomy, and I always get a look from my friends when I drive it. I take it everywhere every chance I get! "
pontiac,vibe,2005,Jack McCormick, 02/05/2005,A Huggable Little Car,4,A cute little car that's lots of fun to drive.  Just the right size and the engine performance is better than what you've been told.  It feels and looks like you got more quality than you paid for.
pontiac,vibe,2005,pinkQ, 02/04/2005,my vibe....,4,I purchasee my vibe in 2003 but that wasn't a choice... it is a great zippy car that can hold a TON of stuff... great on the mileage and the only drawback that I have found is a sulfurous odor when I use the heat on occasion.. I was told by the dealer that there would be solution eventually but still have not found it... 
pontiac,vibe,2005,Norm, 02/05/2005,Vibe Owner,4,"Very flexible design. Nice handling, reasonable ride for a small car.  The engine is unusually noisy under acceleration.  It could use a little more power, but the MPG is quite good. I found the seats a little too low, especially in the front.  Some window tinting would be welcome. Side winds will move it around a bit more than I am used to.  Overall, a fun car to drive."
pontiac,vibe,2005,Beth, 02/05/2005,My Review,5,"I love my Vibe. It is the best car I have ever owned. It is very fun to drive and has great get up and go. Has a wonderful passenger airbag sysytem to turn off the airbag automatically if a child or small adult is sitting in the front passenger seat. Plently of cargo space, GREAT gas mileage, and comfortable seats. The only draw back is it doesn't come with electric windows and entry system unless you bump up to a much pricier model. "
pontiac,vibe,2005,Stina, 02/05/2005,Mischievous car,4,"This car is so fun to drive, my husband who has a car worth $10,000 more wants to drive it! It is great in fuel economy, plus has good pick-up for a 4 cyl. car.  I would only say that the paint is not really up to par since the edges around my doors are chipping. Just get some paint to cover these and you will still love this car!"
pontiac,vibe,2005,Charles Guido, 02/04/2005,drive the Vibe,4,"Great value, fun to drive. Rear sets fold flat-good so as to carry equipment for sports minded people. A small person like myself can sleep inside when on a kayak trip. Add Thule racks to the factory racks and it will carry a secure load."
pontiac,vibe,2005,Rick Hansen, 02/05/2005,"Cool, Fun, Practical & Reliable",5,"I simply love this car. -Chose monochrome color. Enjoy the sound system w/6-CD in dash. Performance is zippy with standard engine & mileage is quite good. Back seat is quite comfortable for guests and so many configurations for stuff (I feel we have as much carrying room as our Jeep Grand Cherokee had). The Pontiac styling with Toyota engineering really works for me.Also, nice having side air bags and anti'lock brakes. I currently have driven almost 70,000 miles on this Vibe and not one rattle. Nice having a rather complete range of electric functions. "
pontiac,vibe,2005,John, 02/10/2005,What a blast to drive,5,"Bought our new Vibe GT about 3 weeks ago. So far, my wife and I like it better every time we drive it. Solid built, corners great. We are both in our 50's and just love the 6-speed stick and high reving 4 cylinder engine. Taking a trip next weekend. Can't wait."
pontiac,vibe,2005,Mandy, 02/19/2005,Love it!,5,"I really love my new Vibe.  I think a lot has to do with the dealership as well.  They were very helpful! This car has been through some rough weather already, and did wonderful!"
pontiac,vibe,2005,CMGierbolini, 03/03/2005,Great Car!,4,My husband and I rented a Vibe around the 2nd week of Dec 2004. We loved it so much we bought one 2 weeks later! It is the best car I've ever driven! It's stylish and fun to drive. I only wish it had a few more horses. Other than that it's the perfect car! I definatly recommend it to anyone!
pontiac,vibe,2005,CPS, 03/05/2005,Pontiac Vibe,5,"This car has a very smooth ride, I feel secure in the way it handles.  It looks good on outside and inside.  The stereo is excellent. I'm very happy with it."
pontiac,vibe,2005,David, 03/05/2005,Fantastic Fusion,5,"2004 Fusion Vibe.  Fusion color receives tons of double takes.  Purchased with some anticipation, but could not be happier with my decision.  Exterior size was a concern, but there is an abundance of interior space.  I love this car.  Purchased with 17 inch wheels and rims, but considering chrome rims soon to make the total package just ""Pop""!    "
pontiac,vibe,2005,Carol T, 03/05/2005,"Fun, Practical & Economical Car!!",4,"The car is not only economical, it is very practical and roomy.  The back seat has more leg room than any other small car we looked at.  We can comfortably fit 4 adults in the car with room to spare.  It is also great for grocery shopping, taking the dogs to the vet, etc.  It has good pep and the ride is nice!  I would highly recommend the car, especially for the price!"
pontiac,vibe,2005,dennishough, 03/09/2005,Life with my Vibe,4,"This is the car I really wanted.  I knew going in that the AWD model was a little underpowered compared to a 5-speed front wheel drive model. Outside style and inside comfort are first rate. Doors all close with that nice Japanese sound and fit.  The trick to driving it is to keep the overdrive turned off while in traffic below 50 mph. Then when everyone is out of your way or you merge onto the highway, kick on the overdrive and let it roll up to 60 + mph. There is a torque converter that allows the overdrive to have a high and low range so you will control that with your touch on the gas peddle. I plan to add power with some after market engine breathing products.Try to get $3000 in rebates"
pontiac,vibe,2005,Patricia, 03/12/2005,versatile,4,"Peppy, manual 5spd trans, excellent acceleration even on steep inclines on open highways, good gas mileage, avg 28mpg city-35mpg highway, easy to maneuver, excellent short-turning range, interior spacious both front & rear for leggy passengers, plenty of head room, comfortable easy to reach for smaller drivers, front and rear seats fold down allowing gracious hauling capacity, excellent versatility as family vehicle seating max5 or camping, garage sailing, etc."
pontiac,vibe,2005,nervisnel, 03/13/2005,The Vibe,4,"I have to say the Vibe is a great little car. I love the way it looks on the inside and out, handles well. Gas mileage right now could be a little better. Maybe it will be when it isn't winter time out and having to be in AWD all the time. If anyone wanted a nice reliable car, the 2005 Vibe is a great deal. Seats are really comfy , easy to move and adjust. "
pontiac,vibe,2005,John, 03/22/2005,Nice car but not for me,4,I bought my wife a 2004 Vibe and have to say we are not very impressed.  Gas mileage is great but performance is lacking.  I realize I did not buy a fast sports car but this car can't get out of it's own way.  On the highway the car is all over the road the second a 5 mph. breeze blows.  The car does not hold the road good at all and my wife and I feel very unsafe in it.  The inside of the car is very stylish with nice gauges and switches but that just doesn't cut it.
pontiac,vibe,2005,cathyy, 03/21/2005,Our second Vibe!,4,"When my husband and I decided to trade in his Grand Am and my Vibe and get just one new car (pending retirement) there was no discussion about which model car to get. We both knew it HAD to be another Vibe. Our Vibes have never given us a moment's worry. Everything Just Works, and looks good while doing it. We get the basic utility of an SUV without the hefty gasoline guzzling. When our daughter visits, the Vibe is her choice of car to borrow due to the easy car seat installation. The optional cargo box prevents groceries from sliding around in the cargo area, and folds flat out of the way. It's an ideal car for almost anyone, young or old. Don't be misled by the marketing."
pontiac,vibe,2005,RAC, 03/21/2005,"Practical, Fun and Reliable",5,"The Vibe was purchased for my wife as a station car and to provide cargo space for weekend errands.  The ride is comfortable, smooth and quiet.  And the car is surprisingly agile on the road - it handles better than we thought it would.  The cargo space (which can be configured a number of ways depending upon back seat position) is especially useful for us - the tie down tracks are ingenious and will help you to secure your cargo.  We do recommend the cargo mat, however, to help prevent cargo slippage.  The Vibe is fun to drive, safe, pratical and so far, reliable.  The fuel economy matters more to us than speed or power, which by the way, is fairly good nevertheless!"
pontiac,vibe,2005,ANANAT, 03/24/2005,GREAT CAR,4,"This is a great car for the money and because my husband is a car sales man and I could have almost any car I want and I chose this one says it all. Great car for a family, lots of room - I put a computer (still in box) right in the back no trouble, did not even have to lay the seats down. Excellent power for not having any bigger motor then it has. This car also handles curves wonderfully. I drive fast around them so I should know."
pontiac,vibe,2005,21&LoveMyVibe, 04/02/2005,21 yr. old gal loves her vibe!,5,"The lease on my 2001 Nissan Sentra SE was up and I wanted a car that was fun to drive, look at, and also reliable. I wanted an SUV but I felt as though I was driving a truck in most of them. I then saw how many types of these ""mini SUV/wagon"" things were out. I narrowed my choices down to the Toyota Matrix (not enough pep, and too noisy, looks kinda cheap next to my vibe) & mazda 3 5 dr. (not really a good lease deal). I was about to give up on finding a car I loved when I decided to pull into Pontiac. I saw the VIBE in the show room, test drove it, and bought it that same day! Everyone at the college I attend has given me compliments. The vibe is so fun to drive and look at, perfect car!"
pontiac,vibe,2005,Zach, 04/04/2005,My 2005 Vibe,5,I recently bought a 2005 Pontiac Vibe.  I have been driving it for a week now and I already love it. I get about 27 mpg and it isnt even broken in yet.  The audio system in it is very good for stock.  This car handles and accelerates beautifully.  I like it and recommend it to anybody looking for a fuel saving zippy car.
pontiac,vibe,2005,Stacy Volin, 05/05/2005,Best Car for Your Bucks,5,"If you want a car that can store a lot, look nice and feel comfortable even on long car rides, buy this one. Price is reasonable for everyone. It rides like a Lexus without the price tag. I almost bought a 330X Lexus. Saved myself lots of bucks and gave myself OnStar which is quite an advantage."

pontiac,vibe,2005,Avid Napper, 06/02/2005,Cheap and cheery,4,"I needed to economize and fast, so traded in my 2005 Dodge Magnum SXT with AWD for a 2005 Pontiac Vibe with AWD.  While I miss the pickup and heft of the Magnum, I certainly don't miss the frequent trips to the gas station. Plus, the Vibe hugs the road and is surprisingly peppy for a car that gets great mileage (well, compared to the PT Cruiser I had before the Magnum, which didn't get such great mileage, come to think of it).  While I was afraid I was going to resent driving around in an economy- mobile (and honestly, I will wish Pontiac offered heated seats when winter returns), I'm quite pleased with it. And my partner, a snob where American cars are concerned, enjoys driving it too."
pontiac,vibe,2005,NewPontiacOwner, 06/22/2005,"Great Wagon, Toyota Quality, Best Buy",5,"Fun to drive. Great build quality. Stylish. One great GM/Toyota joint project. I prefer the look of the Pontiac Vibe better than the Toyota Matrix. I like the newly design antenna just like those in BMW. It produces great power, handles very well. Keep up the good work Pontiac!"
pontiac,vibe,2005,Manny R, 07/04/2005,Enjoy the drive,5,"The vehicle has a lot of room is fun to drive fuel economy is great and the 4cly engine is pretty good for the size of vhicle. i am able to park easily the rear quarter windows have a slight blind spot but you can adjust. easy entry and getting out allows my elderly mom to get in and out easily a nice firm ride i can fell the road with the 17"" wheels handles corners like a sports car with less stops at the gas pump i am very satisfied with my vibe if my kids would need a car for collage i would buy another no hesitation.quality vehiclee worth your hard earned $$$$$$"

pontiac,vibe,2005,Sondra Coble, 07/14/2005,My 2005 Pontiac Vibe,4,I love my 2005 Pontiac Vibe. It has lots of get up and go when I need it like coming from a exit ramp onto a highway. It handles really well and I just love driving it. I have 8 grandchildren and it is especially nice when I have small grandkids in the back. It has the child safety locks as well as window locks. I have piece of mind knowing they can not open a window or door while I'm driving down the road. It is also very spacious and roomy in the back seat. I was amazed when I finally rode back there. I'm 53 years old and it's one of the best investments I have ever made.   
pontiac,vibe,2005,Deanna, 07/16/2005,The Matrix only better,5,I love my Vibe.  You will not ever need another car.  The folding seats make it the best ever and most versitile vehicle I have owned in 30 years.  Fun to drive and the styling is wonderful.  More features than the Matrix and more comfortable this vehicle is built by Toyota and is the same as the Matrix with better options.  Great for families and my grandkids love it.
pontiac,vibe,2005,Matt, 07/18/2005,Tin Foil Car,2,"This car is a basic to and from work car. Front fenders are thinner than the Lunar Lander's. Interior is cheap, cheap, cheap.

Scared to death of being hit in this car at any speed.Cannot shut off auto headlights.Undercoat on car has to be re - applied due to poor quality control. Passenger seat too low. No power seats available."
pontiac,vibe,2005,Ellen, 08/02/2005,Love My Vibe!,5,"I love my VIBE! This car handles great, is fun to drive, is fuel efficient (and clean burning!) and it looks cool.  It easily carries our canoe, kayaks, bikes and hauls around our 100lb Black Lab.   "
pontiac,vibe,2005,Rod in Portland, OR,"Well designed, well made, great mileage",4,"It took two months, but I researched and drove every car in this class.  Selected base-model because it is best all-around fit for me. Toyota Matrix was second (identical mechanicals.  Vibe is exported to Japan as a Toyota.)  Car had to be less than 175 inches long because of short garage.  Vibe is 171.  Very practical, fun, versatile car. Very easy to drive. I've used it on trips to Seattle and the Oregon Coast, around town, and for hauling stuff including 8-ft 2X6's.  I keep meticulous expense records.  32.6 overall mpg to date (city/highway).  Best ever was 39.3 freeway mpg @ approx. 75 mph with air conditioning on.  Glad to have automatic driving lights in this rainy climate.          "
pontiac,vibe,2005,KATI, 08/10/2005,Great choice to drive,4,"I love my vibe. My daughter thinks its great. We both like the moon roof. I compared and looked at many vehicles and finally decided on the vibe due to gas mileage. I drive to work 65 miles 1 way 4 or 5 nights per week. It actually gets 32-33 mpg, but then again i don't drive the speed limit all the time. For a 4 cylinder it does have a lot of pep!!!!!!!! Its the best!!!!"
pontiac,vibe,2005,goodvibrations, 08/18/2005,Blue Vibe base fwd auto power package,5,I have only had the car for two weeks but I am very pleased. Like sitting up higher than a normal car. Good interior space and hatch glass that opens separately is handy. Nice that the passenger seat folds down so kids son can get a nice view of the road. Love the dash. Provides all the information you need and its just plain cool. Gas mileage is excellent and I like the gearing. At 100 km per hr (60 mph US) only reving at 2500 rpms. Great little family wagan with a sporty twist no regrets with my purchase.
pontiac,vibe,2005,CougarVibe, 09/07/2005,"So far, so good!",4,"With the rediculous rise in gas prices and the incentives available from GM (Employee Discount/$1K Cash/$1K ""Conquest""), I was more than happy to buy my Vibe and get rid of my Explorer. Besides very good gas mileage, I bought this vehicle because of its AWD ability and Toyota drive-train.  The exterior is much better looking than the Matrix, the car is very functional thanks to the storage room and 5-doors, and it definitely has a stylish character.  The interior layout is good, with only a few complaints (center armrest is too short, CC is located in awkward place, no power driver's seat).  Overall, I'm very happy considering I got an AWD for the FWD MSRP!"
pontiac,vibe,2005,Vibe Viewer, 09/07/2005,VIBErations,4,"From the first time I drove my Vibe, I was completely satisfied with ALMOST every detail. The only exceptions would be the compromised visibility due to the wide plastic rear window supports and the cramped control panel when the gear shift is in park. The gas cap release lever could be a bit larger. I am a heavy man but the seats and leg room are still extremely comfortable. The gas mileage is about 30 mpg, even with the a/c. The car is 'tight' (no squeaks) and the ride is excellent for almost any size vehicle. The price was excellent considering the many factory-installed options. Well done, GM!"
pontiac,vibe,2005,One of the Best, 09/15/2005,One of the Best,5,"This car is one of the best I have ever driven in this price category.  It is less expensive then the Toyota Matrix, comes with more standard equipment and with the GM Employee Discount, plus other discounts, this car was a real buy for me.  The fuel mileage is great (29 in the city), higher on the road.  It handles like a much bigger car and has enough room to put lots in the back with the seats down.  I highly recommend it."
pontiac,vibe,2005,tjs317, 09/20/2005,an american car that rocks,5,"okay, I wanted to buy american & get the reliability of a toyota. Nuff said, same assembly line as toyota matrix. a 6 speed tied to the yamaha engine doesn't hurt, either!!!"
pontiac,vibe,2005,Andy, 09/19/2005,Great car for the money,5,The '05 Vibe is an excellent car to drive.  The vvt-i engine is very responsive even at lower rpm's.  You don't have to sacrifice gas milage like you would with a Vibe GT.  This one has all the power you need.  I prefer the five speed over the six speed transmission also.  It shifts without the knotchy feeling of the six speed I drove ('03).  The interior is spacious and comfortable with plenty of cargo room.  The back seats fold down flat unlike some hatchbacks.  Tie straps are included to help hold cargo on the slick plastic surfaces. The exterior design of the Vibe is streamline and sporty.  A worth while option is the appearance package which includes color keyed bumpers and fog lights.
pontiac,vibe,2005,Bob, 10/02/2005,Vibe Review,4,"I'm still liking my '05 Vibe.  Since gasoline is nearing $3/gallon in my area, the economy of the car is the main attraction.  Still, I like the exterior styling very much and the interior is modern, too.  The handling is better than I expected and the car is perfect for those suburban errands.  I've driven it on the highway and it is relatively quiet below 70 mph.  I easily bettered the EPA highway estimates by simply accelerating a little less aggressively.  The fact that it's built by an American manufacturer makes me feel better.  I still turn around and look at it when I get out."
pontiac,vibe,2005,Gary, 10/19/2005,Vibe 05,4,"On the good side, robust for a 4- cylinder, SUV-like roominess with seats down, mileage great @ 55-60mph, not so good averaging 70mph as could be expected. On the bad side, rough downshift when braking downhill, annoying seatbelt reminder, headlights that can't make up their mind at dawn and dusk. Overall a very sound car."
pontiac,vibe,2005,anitalazr, 11/03/2005,Love my Vibe,4,"Vibe fit the bill of low cost and good gas mileage.  I love my little red pontiac.  It is great for around town, easy to park, hauls 4 adults very comfortable, and the hatchback is great for shopping/storage.  Drove it from L.A. to S.F. in Calif, along Highway 1 (the beautiful coast) .. my Vibe did great, handled well."
pontiac,vibe,2005,Harold Wainwright, 11/26/2005,Cool Little Car,5,"The biggest temptation to buy was the price and the fuel mileage. All the other features were a bonus. My Vibe goes out of his way to do for me what I ask, and more."
pontiac,vibe,2005,slammerbob, 11/24/2005,Oh what Car,5,"This is the second vibe we have owned, we had a 2004 vibe and had traded in on a honda civic hybrid that was a mistake .  We bought the awd in august and really enjoy driving it. Plenty of space to haul anything like a mountain bike or a power washer with room to spare.  The earlier vibe had a problem with storage under the shifter staying closed.  We intend to keep this one I hope subaru takes note their vehicles are getting to expensive for the average family to afford."
pontiac,vibe,2005,NewPontiacDriver, 12/05/2005,One of the Best Decisions I've made!!!,4,"I've had this car for three months now and I am completely statisfied with it so far.  It drives nice, accelerates adqeuately, stops confidentally, and most importantly (for me) pulls through the snow with no problem.  My steep, snow covered driveway is a problem no more.  Also I love the fact that it is pratically a Toyota in GM clothing."
pontiac,vibe,2005,jerry, 12/06/2005,What a great!!!!! Little car,5,"what a great little car.  I love the seats that sit up like your riding in an SUV, very comfortable on the back.  The acceleration is surprising for the size of the engine.  Lots of great standard features.  I like the low tire warning indicator, the external temperature indicator, the built-in- dash AC jack, rear window wiper, defroster, and great gas mileage.  Also, it has great head room, and great leg room in the back seat.  One of my main reason for buying is that it has a toyota motor, and toyota transmission as well as being built at the toyota assembly plant.  Wow..Wow..Wow...if you are looking for great gas mileage, and a fun to drive, peppy, and comfortable care.  This care has it!"
pontiac,vibe,2005,Rob, 01/11/2006,Good ergonomics,4,"I originally wanted to replace my 85 Voyager with a new minivan but I would have to spend an additional five grand to own a van vs a Vibe. I drove past a local dealer and took one home to show the family. My wife and two boys climbed in and were surprised at the amount of room inside this neat car.The first thing you notice is that you sit up high giving you fantastic visibility, as well as great ease of entry and exit.The 1.8 liter motor has plenty of power and zips through traffic just fine. It is also amazing how much you  can fit inside, fold the seats down all the way,or half way, you can load up for a craft show or major grocery shopping. This is a small car with a big attitude, get one."
pontiac,vibe,2005,Jon Dixon, 01/27/2006,I like my Vibe,3,"I think your review is spot on.  It's a good overall package of style economy vesatility and performance.  I had to make a couple of quick maneavers to avoid trouble and handled confidently and stuck to the road.  We didn't need a big SUV, but wanted to have some utiliy.  A good balance.  "
pontiac,vibe,2005,Shirley B, 02/18/2006,this is a keeper!,4,"Love this Vibe.  The arrangement of the drivers seat is first time I have sat comfortably to drive. no leg fatigue. It handles wonderfully, and has plenty of pickup and 'go' for me!  I drive in excess of 65 miles each day, mostly freeway and my gas consumption is an average of 34 mpg.  Mostly it is closer to 35mpg.  I cant help but wonder why they are not advertised more. (but then, I found mine from just seeing an associates new purchase in the parking lot.)  The only thing I might change is in the area of the arm rest console. It sets just a little too far back to be convenient for me. I am totally  satisfied with this purchase. I plan to keep it a long time. Very impressive little vehicle"
pontiac,vibe,2005,automatic, 03/05/2006,best vehicle I ever owned,4,"very comfortable. very easy to manuever. the gas mileage is constant at 33 to 35mpg. Always looks great. Plenty of cargo space, easy to put the back seats down to maximize the room available for cargo. sound system is very good. Love the angle of the passenger dash placement of the air bag. is not set to hurt passenger, but too cover the windsheild, and minimize possibilty of severe trauma. My only complaint is I don't love the arm rest and places for drinks etc. you need to grope to locate. all in all, I plan to keep it as long as I possibly can. It would be hard to duplicate the good features. "
pontiac,vibe,2005,TR, 03/21/2006,Good looking fair performance,3,Like the look. Slow at start but better at high speed. Don't feel safe at high speed. I got automatic which said 29-34 mpg but never been higher than 30 mpg (most on highway). A little difficult to see when backup. Engine is noisy. Tires are expensive for the side. Inside smells like egg. Cheap material for dashboard. Quite comfort seats but not for big guy. People on rear seats can easily kick something under the front seat. Air conditioner control is hard with gear at parking position. Poor rear washer. I bought it because it is Toyota inside but the outside is better than matrix and got a good deal. Sticker price is too high with this car. Dealer was not good but service dept is nice. 
pontiac,vibe,2005,Jack, 03/22/2006,Love My Vibes,5,Recently took a 4000 mile trip from FL to AZ and return; my Vibe was flawless and performed superbly on the flat land as well as the mountain portions of the trip. My prior car was a Grand marquis and I can honestly say that the Vibe was a more comfortable car on this potentially arduous trip. 
pontiac,vibe,2005,EDM, 04/18/2006,great fun,4,"Read reviews before purchasing.  The GT model has the extra horsepower to get up to highway speeds in a hurry. The six speed takes some getting used to, but it is fun to drive."
pontiac,vibe,2005,jpt, 12/21/2006,diggin the vibe,5,"I have really enjoyed owning a my Vibe.  I love the affordability and the versatility of it.  Especially, for the limited driving I do.  If I spent a great deal of time in the car, I probably would not have chosen the Vibe because it is underpowered.  It has been a great car and completely reliable.  I most definitely would recommend it and would likely buy one again. I would love to see it with a more powerful engine and am sorry to see that they have discontinued the AWD....which is sure footed here in Michigan. The best part is that it is an American nameplate with Japanese reliability."
pontiac,vibe,2006,k_texas, 05/16/2012,A Great Car ... Through The Years!,4,"I bought my Vibe new back in early '07 ... here it is five years later and I still love it.
She (yes, it's a girl -- with her own name) just turned the corner and has safely and efficiently taken me over 100,000 miles.
Can't rave enough about fuel economy.
Last road trip was just a few weeks ago (about 900 miles r/t) ... she did me proud with 30-35 mpg!!
Really??
YES!

I noticed a past reviewer commented on very poor handling in Midwest winter snows.
I'd like to chime in on that and say mine was quite the Opposite.
She handled herself very respectably in a South Dakota winter -- with FOUR blizzards back-to-back."
pontiac,vibe,2006,bike_canoe2, 05/10/2011,Keep the Recall in Mind,3,"I agree with Edumonds it is sluggish, but 32 mpg city is a definate advantage.
 The seating is comfortable, road noise is average.
 It is fun to drive but it's not a sports car.
NOW ABOUT THE RECALL - the PCM (performance control module) has issues, it will leave you stranded on the side of the road when it fails.
The recall covers specific years, and specific engines so check yours at NHTSA.GOV and have it replaced if yours is recalled!
 The recall will cover replacing the PCM, labor, and towing to a GM dealer, but it does not cover a loaner vehicle.
The dealer is very confident about the reliablity of this vehicle, this is the only issue they have with this vehicle."
pontiac,vibe,2006,123me, 09/29/2013,"213,000 plus Miles",5,"I hope I don't jinx everything by updating my Review. But here goes. My Vibe will turn 14 in the fall, and I now have just over 213,000 miles on it. It's a terrifically reliable vehicle, and I would recommend buying it as a used car. The vehicle sits higher than a sedan which makes getting in and out a breeze. The seats are comfortable and this includes the backseat which has plenty of cushion and leg room, not to mention ceiling height. Someone over 6' tall is fine sitting in the backseat. With the pull of a lever the seat backs flatten out the entire cargo area. It's amazing how much of a load you can get into this car. Vibe design excels in achieving a flat cargo space. It's so much easier to slide cargo in and out when not negotiating height differences many of the other vehicles have. In addition the front passenger seat folds down and gives 8 feet of interior length.  Currently I have a 7ft ladder inside the vehicle I am taking to a job.. The rear window will also open when you need to transport all those boards with the fluttering red flag. Gas mileage is still great. I average 30 MPG, but can get up to 33 with more freeway driving, or after an oil change and the tire pressure restored. My repairs up to this point have only been routine maintenance. Batteries, oil changes, tires. Only my satellite radio's digital dial has faded. It still works I just can't see the station numbers. But the presets are still intact. The paint has taken a beating from a lot of bad road conditions but despite the numerous nicks, the original paint has never faded or peeled, and this car has never been housed in a garage. I'll keep you posted how much longer I have it, but at this point I still love my Vibe. 
"
pontiac,vibe,2006,Scott, 03/30/2016,Best Car We've ever owned!,5,"This is by far the best car we've ever owned.  220k and still great. Only repairs have been brakes, battery, serpentine belt, wiper blades and tires. Regular maintenance important, done with tranny fluid at each 50k, plugs at each 100k, same with coolant. Oil and filter every 5k. Still have original alternator, a/c unit (no recharge needed on freon), muffler system, hoses. Stock radio w/ 5 cd changer blew after 3 years-replaced with after market. Almost 10 years and this car is still going. Hope to get 230k then it's time to retire the Vibe....with tears in my eyes then I am sure."
pontiac,vibe,2006,34mpg, 03/16/2013,Still high mpg!,5,"I have owned my Vibe since buying it off the lot in 2006.
Over 335,000 miles and it is still averaging 33.4 mpg.
Replaced the manual clutch due to some slippage at 247,000 miles, well beyond what most people would have thought a clutch would last.  The alternator died at 285,000 miles.  Those are the only major breakdowns.
Still love the fact that it came with a 110 v wall outlet style plug in the console!  Can use the same cellphone charger in the house as in the car.  I can't believe theses don't come standard on all vehicles.
No equipment problems other than the known PCM issue that was recalled/replaced and 3 of the 4 door handles broke off.  Replacing them are cheap ($11 off Amazon) and easy to do (thanks Youtube).  Just drove 1200 miles at 5 mph above the speed limit and got 34.2 mpg!
"
pontiac,vibe,2006,vibe_06_5speed, 11/10/2012,Vibe 2006 5 speed manual - 286 000 km,4,"I bought this car when it had 170 000 km on it, since then (over 2 years ago) I've put on many miles on it (now have 286 000 km).
I am very satisfied with the car.


I have not put ANY repairs since I've had it other then repainting the top (little bit of rust started).

I consistently get between 40 - 44 MPG (Canadian) doing mostly highway (that is about 33 - 36 US MPG).
I drive conservative though, I keep it around 100 km/h on highway.

I like the exterior of the vibe better then the matrix.
The car has good cargo space and when you flip down the seats you get ridiculous amount of room back there, you don't know what your missing until you've had it trust me!

Highly recommend!"
pontiac,vibe,2006,beloved06vibe, 06/18/2012,My Beloved Vibe,5,"I bought my 2006 Vibe new and would still be driving it had it not been totalled on Memorial Day. That car had 110,000 miles on it and I NEVER had any problems with it. It drove beautifully until its last day. It was comfortable and great on gas, held 3 kids and all their stuff, and I smiled every time I approached it. If you get the chance to get one, take it!!!"
pontiac,vibe,2006,Roland Charriez, 10/05/2016,2006 Pontiac Vibe,5,"It's been a great car. Great gas mileage for an AWD. Cargo space is amazing. Low maintenance and still fun to drive and wonderful in the snow. It's running perfect at 310k.

Enough room for a string bass and 2 children.
Great car!  We live where there are dirt roads and rough roads, no repairs needed.
It has a timing belt. I drive 500 miles per week and average 35 mpg.  When I freeway drive it's 40 mpg.
I have been rear ended twice. Once by a large pick-up truck (I opted to not repair) and recently by a semi trailer truck and I am still driving my Vibe.  This time repairs are needed due to my crunched lift gate.  I need to transport the string bass.

pontiac,vibe,2006,Patrick, 09/17/2005,Once in a while,4,"Background: This purchase was a new 2003 Vibe in 2002.  This is a long term veiw of the car.  Do you know the feeling when you buy I knew car?  When you love your new car?  I did.  I loved this car, and still do, as much as the day I drove it off the lot.  It held speed at 80 across the western US on a recent 4000 mile round trip and got 34 MPG while doing it. This was with automatic Tranny too.  The power train is from the Corolla, tranny also, but the interior space is like a large sedan.  You never feel cramped. The test drive will show how it feels and that is the way it will feel 3 years later. I liked the Vibe so much, I bought one for my wife last December. See Favorite Feature below."
pontiac,vibe,2006,OmahaBob, 12/06/2006,My Beautiful Lava Red Vibe,5,"Current miles = 3471. Highest MPG so far using ethanol blend = 32.6. Avg MPG so far = 28.0. I Like:  Price with rebates was good.  Good forward visibility. Easy to enter & exit.  Body is solid, not tinny.  The auto trans is geared well to accommodate small engine; Smooth shifting.  Great utility.   MPG is good, but not great.  I love the handling and easy, quick steering.  Comfortable to drive.  I like the anchored front floormats Dislike:  With sunglasses on, cant see what's on clock/radio screen. With the car in park its difficult to adjust A/C controls. These are minor.  With the A/C on at 75-80 MPH, it automatically downshifts on some hills and hits 4400 RPM."
pontiac,vibe,2006,Carol, 06/29/2018,Loving my Vibe,5,"This is an awesome car!!!!! It is my 3rd one. The first one (2006) I had for 3 years, the person who has it now is still driving it with going on 168,000 miles. The second one (2009 GT) was rear ended by a Ford F-150 and I was not hurt,  the car was totaled but she held up. Now I have a 2006 and it's awesome. I have never had to put any money into the cars except normal maintenance. They are economical, sporty, safe and low maintenance. The only thing I hate is they stopped making them and they are getting harder and harder to find.

pontiac,vibe,2006,Gregg, 12/28/2005,2006 Vibe,5,We drive 50 miles a day over Bozeman pass to go to work. The Pontiac Vibe handles the hills and curves with ease in all types of weather from wet roads to 3 foot snow drifts.
pontiac,vibe,2006,SanFranciscoBadVibe, 12/07/2006,Beware San Francisco drivers,3,"I will try to differentiate between my major criticism of the car and my other opinions. I drive almost exclusively in SF and was looking for much more economical city car. Although advertised as 29 MPG/city I am lucky to get 18. I would like to get feedback from other SF residents what they are getting. Otherwise this is a pretty great car. The hatchback versatility plus remote keyless entry, sunroof, comfortable seating position are great. This is a fun, attractive vehicle that suprisingly has been easy for me parking on the street. There is enough horsepower to handle the hills too. BTW, I have an automatic but you can only pick manual on this site. I also recommend using Costco to buy."
pontiac,vibe,2006,bobsmith1127, 05/13/2010,Great First Car,4,"My mom bought this to replace her mini van and I got it about a year ago. Its a great, versatile car with some sportiness on the side. The inside is modern and is still in style after 4 years. It has great headroom and leg room for 4 adults. The folding seats are great, I can fit my drum set no problem. The sound system is pretty good for 4 speakers, lots of bass and clean sound. The engine is a little small (130 HP) but it accelerates fine and does good on hills."
pontiac,vibe,2006,babyteach58, 05/23/2010,Best car ever!,5,I love this car! I read reviews before I bought it and was very impressed. I bought my 06 Vibe to replace my 03 Dodge Neon. I was shocked at how much better the gas milage is! It has everything I want in a car. It is bigger inside than it looks. I love the room in the back seat and the seats are very comfortable. Cargo room is better than expected. The only problem I had mechanically is the torque converter needed replacing last year but it was still under warranty. I drive it daily 45 minutes each way to work and back and am excited to take it on my first long trip in 2 weeks (680 miles one way) Too bad it has been discontinued. I will buy them until they cant be found anymore!
pontiac,vibe,2006,vibe06, 06/04/2010,Hate to Sell - LOVED THIS CAR,5,"Best car ever owned.  Unable to drive anymore - health issues.

pontiac,vibe,2006,blogan, 01/05/2006,Maiden Voyage,5,"First major trip, NY to FL to MO and back. What a hoot. Loaded down with golf clubs and luggage for two people, two climates. Wife managed to get her first speeding ticket in 20 years! Seats are incredibly comfortable, even on the first day, a 17 hour marathon! We're not youngsters anymore but no aches and pains from the ride. If it had another 12 inches in the luggage area, I'd trade my Park Avenue for another one! Driving it like a sports car and still well over 30 mpg! Only other car we've ever owned that was more fun to drive was the original Toyota Celica GT we had in the 70s."
pontiac,vibe,2006,W Barnes, 05/22/2006,Good Vibes!,4,"A really great car to own and drive!  Get lots of compliments, especially about the color (stealth grey, really a greenish, sometimes bluish) that changes depending upon the light and time of day.  Would buy again but next time with stability and traction control (wanted this time but price with all options was just too high).  If you are looking for an auto with a high seating position, gas economy, ample cargo space and options, a little more ground clearance than average, an alternative to an SUV and style, this is it!  (If GM/Toyota would make the changes below the car would be near perfect.)"
pontiac,vibe,2006,D Jensen, 07/10/2006,Nice Car,5,I just bought my Vibe and love it. Was looking for a small fuel efficient car that has lots of room and does ok on highway.  But wife uses it around town mostly. She loves it.  Can't wait to take it on a longer trip to see how it does. It's not a big car but it feels close to it. 
pontiac,vibe,2006,Warren Curt, 08/03/2006,"The Vibe , a Great Little Car",4,This car has all I am looking for with the current fuel situation.  I replaced a V8 truck and have cut my fuel consumoption in 1/2.  It cruises very well at 75 MPH.  There are numerous storage areas. It has very adequate space for 4 adults. I like the styling better than it's cousin the Toyota Matrix. I would recomend this car to anyone.
pontiac,vibe,2006,First New Car ever, 10/25/2006,First New Car Owned,5,"We bought this car after quite a bit of reviewing similar cars. We liked the way the back seats fold flat. We compared it with the Matrix, but we didn't like the looks of the Matrix as well. We needed a practical car to fit our dog, and to haul stuff on occasions. This vehicle is working out very well. We bought the 5 speed, no bells or fancy stuff. Car gets 34+ MPG in the city, and gets 37+ MPG on the highway. With careful driving could get more MPG maybe 35-38 plus. It's  fun to drive, so it is not easy to keep the foot of the gas...the wife would have liked the automatic better, but she is liking the stick now. The vibe was a good buy decision for us, handles great, good visibility."

pontiac,vibe,2006,secman, 08/20/2006,Fun Little Car,4,"I bought this car for one reason - gas mileage - and so far it has been great, but still disappointing.  I do mostly highway driving and so far, I have averaged 30.85 MPG over the first 2500 miles.  This is great, but not the 34 MPG EPA estimate for an automatic Vibe.  My only other complaints are that the seats are not as comfortable as they could be (they could use a lumbar support), and the side mirrors are pretty small.  But now for the good: Fun, fun, fun to drive...great pickup in low RPMs. Large windows in the front and on the sides (great sight lines) Great stereo (Monsoon package) Great interior space for a little car Great height for a little car Good handling 0%/72 mos"

We traded in our 2005 Equinox due to it's uncomfortable leather seats and horrible gas mileage....wow!  Did we hit big with our 2005 Vibe!  The seats are so comfortable, the gas mileage is great! It is a pleasure to drive.  It has responsive steering.  The visibility when driving is great, no blind spots. The back seat is roomy, even for a taller person.  We are so glad we bought this car!

pontiac,vibe,2006,gmmas, 04/30/2006,A good buy,4,"I tested this car in comparison to many others thinking that it would not be enough car for me.  I tested it on the highway and found that it was plenty of car to pass and I could get a ticket if I tried..no problem.  It has also been very functional with a lot of cargo room and very handy tie down spots for bungee cords.  The roof rack is pretty much just for decoration though in my opinion.  I get 35 mph on the highway with the AC on and after over 11,000 miles have not had a single initial quality issue.  Lastly many other cars have stolen the overall Vibe styling.  The vibe was the first with this general look."
pontiac,vibe,2006,Charles, 05/13/2006,Surprise,5,"I was very surprised with the room and the ride.  I was use to a larger vehicle.  It is just right to run around town.

There is lots of head, leg and arm room. Plenty of cargo space. And we are averaging around 31 mpg. We got the Moon & Tunes package (which really really rocks), the Power Package and the Safety Package with Side Air Bags & ABS. The car is very fun to drive and we haven't had any problems with the car at all (No vibrations, Nosies, Etc.)

I researched about 10 different vehicles, and the Vibe just cannot be beat for both price and fuel economy.  Not to mention the rear cargo area that my sons can toss their football gear into!  And the car is great looking---kind of like a cross between a station wagon & SUV.  I also noticed that it rides ""too well"" at higher speeds.  I have to keep my eye on the speedometer while on the interstate because twice I found myself driving way too fast without even knowing it! I recommend using your cruise control until you're used to how well the vehicle drives."

pontiac,vibe,2006,Jason, 08/30/2006,Nice Compact Car,5,"Coming from a 2004 Malibu V6, the fuel economy on this car is a welcome change. For the engine size, this thing puts out a lot of power. Occasionally, I am left wanting during passing maneuvers, but for the most part, no complaints. The engine does get a little loud when the RPMs get up there, but it is never unwelcome. Interior-wise, the car is very comfortable and all the controls are well placed. Gauges are bright and easy to read and the car handles superbly. I would not hesitate to buy another one of these great little cars."

Car accelerates quickly.  Looked at Matrix and Caliber which are in same class as the Vibe.  Looked at the Toyota Yaris as well. Took this car for test drive and bought it same night. This was our 4th car from the dealership and are very happy with it. Hope to keep it for many years 
pontiac,vibe,2006,gatekeeper, 09/04/2007,Solid Car,4,"Great car, good gas mileage, lots of fun, few things on the dash and in the driver side door squeeked but I had the door fixed and the dash noise comes and goes but its not bad at all. It is very comfy and fun to drive."
pontiac,vibe,2006,DrGreg, 10/14/2007,Excellent reliable economical vehicle,5,"The Vibe is an excellent car for a small family that needs room and economy. The rear seat folds flat and is hard plastic so you can easily slide your stuff in and out. The cargo mat (or carpet) is a good option to keep stuff from sliding around, and it also quiets it down a bit. The performance is adequate, the Toyota engine revs freely if you ever need to pass. The only problem I've had is when the oil was changed, someone put the windshield washer tube out of its clip so it was kinked and no fluid came out. This was quickly fixed and adjusted correctly at the dealer. It gets excellent mileage and is fun to drive. I recommend it for someone not needing the space of a minivan. "
pontiac,vibe,2006,osuraerae, 12/09/2010,LOVE this car! Will drive it till the wheels fall off!,5,"I love this car! It has been a dream to own. No major problems and coming up on 80000 miles, only routine maintenance needed. It is reliable and comfortable. "

pontiac,vibe,2006,bmontgomery, 11/24/2008,I would buy another Vibe,4,I have had my Vibe for over a year now and I am happy with it. I can get 33 mpg on the highway if I keep it below 70 mph. City driving in a Minnesota winter is more like 24 mpg but that story is the same with all my cars. My only complaint is that the cargo area is not wide enough. I bought a station wagon so that I could carry stuff and the Vibe has let me down a few times. 
pontiac,vibe,2006,Joe S., 02/18/2010,Best car I have ever owned,4,The Vibe was a replacement for a Forester Subaru strictly for economic reasons. The Forester was a bit thirsty especially on city driving. Have had the Vibe for over 4 years during which time the car proved to be a true work horse that demanded little if no maintenance at all. Still on original tires and brakes after 40K miles.  
pontiac,vibe,2006,Texmac, 01/19/2006,"Great, fun car to drive.",5," This is a great car to buy, I drive 60 miles a day to work. I just love the way it handles the road & hills. "
pontiac,vibe,2006,SteveT, 01/21/2006,Does what I hoped for,4,"After a terrible experience with a VW Jetta (it lived in the shop), I was looking for a solid, reliable vehicle with good fuel economy. So far the Vibe fits the bill. I've had ZERO problems so far in a time period that the Jetta would've filled with one thing after another. I did a lot of research and was very impressed by the philosophy and reputation of the NUMMI plant where the Vibe is built. It certainly shows in the final product."
pontiac,vibe,2006,Jeff, 02/06/2006,Great Car For The Price,4,"I purchased this car due to its american styling and toyota engineering a great combination, along with 30+mpg. I found that a the heart of the vibe is the toyota corolla engine/transmission as well as some other carry overs from toyota and is better looking than the matrix. So far ive been very pleased with the handling/ride quality and how quiet it is on the freeway and lots of pep at freeway speeds. The dash is laid out nice and the styling circular designs are a plus. Plenty of backseat space for my 3 year old and really like how the middle and passenger seats fold flat and have protective covering on the backside. Very pleased and i like this alliance of GM/Toyota Toyota at a GM price."
pontiac,vibe,2006,airgun25, 06/04/2006,the best little car ever,4,"This car has been the best economy car i have ever owned. It has the power the comfort and the looks. It is well built car and good on gas I have been getting almost 40miles to the gallon, great car for students and adults a like. If you are looking for a nice fuel economy car that has the power, comfort and looks this is the one I would choose. "

I really like the turn-ratio.. the pick up is really good it you let it get to 4000 or 5000 rmp the car will take off!! great gas milage.. love the 60,40 fold down seats... over all best car I have owned in a long time"

pontiac,vibe,2006,DHancock, 09/24/2006,My sweet little Vibe,5,"My husband and I rented a Vibe to take on a long trip. The more I rode/drove the car, the more I fell in love. We returned it on a Monday and that Wednesday, we bought one. It doesn't have much get up and go when passing but once you get that little thing out on the interstate, it goes. The deciding factor was the Toyota engine. This sports utility car is for anyone wanting an SUV but just can't afford the gas or want to sit up as high as a school bus. It is roomy and an absolute dream to drive. My 16 yr old daughter wants one - now that is something to rave about. If a teenager wants to be seen in it, it has to be a 'cool ride'. I'm so glad we found it. I absolutely adore this vehicle. "
pontiac,vibe,2006,Steve, 11/16/2006,I'm happy.,4,"Excellent car. Rented one for a trip from Texas to Colorado. The car performed well-even in the mountains.  Hit a big mule deer in W. Texas.  We were fine-but the car seemed pretty damaged (160 mile tow).  Even so, I liked the car so much I bought one.   Looked at the Matrix, but toyota doesn't come down on price much.  The Pontiac dealer knocked off $1,000 and then another $1,000 because I was not a pontiac owner.  Upon signing the papers I noticed another $600 off ($2600 total off $19,500 MSRP)because Champion Pontiac wants to give the lowest price. In and out in 2 hours.   "
pontiac,vibe,2006,Buckeye, 11/17/2006,Me and My Vibe,5,"Love this car - owned two SUVs previously but had to give them up due to distances traveled and gas expenses. Found this little gem and I feel right at home - sitting up high and feeling safe while getting the added bonus of good gas mileage. Performs very well; quite zippy.  People (teens included) like the car's performance and appearance. We love the audio system, sun roof and fast-responding heater. It is keeps us warm!  We are ready for the nasty winter :)"
pontiac,vibe,2006,Luv My Car, 11/21/2006,It's Great,4,"I absolutely love my little Vibe.  I got the Sun & Sound pkg, so it looks and sounds great too.  I love the spunkiness it has for such a little car, especially for a 4 cyl automatic, and it runs great on a cross-country trip.  It holds as much as my old clunky Isuzu Rodeo, and gets twice the gas mileage!"
pontiac,vibe,2006,MoldbaseSteve, 01/17/2007,6 months 21000 miles Salesman Style,4,"Great little car, great comfort, great mileage, great cargo capacity. I am a outside salesman and after 21k miles in 6 months I can say this is one nice car. averaged 38 mpg in the summer about 34-5 in the winter, simply fantastic, very comfortable and this is after at least 4 hours in the car 5 days a week. Dual power outlets keep my laptop on and my phone powered up, have hauled some pretty impressive items for the wagons size ""do you have a truck?"" nope i have the Vibe. The one complaint I really have is that the handling and steering while quite capable are not fun, but this is coming from someone who drives a miata or a motorcycle, so It's probably more nitpicking than anything"
pontiac,vibe,2006,mbc, 04/13/2007,Great gas mileage!,5,"The Vibe provides a great ride and gets super gas mileage. Yeah, the road noise on rough surface roads is a little noisy, so turn up the radio a little, get over it. Enjoy all the other positves about the Vibe. Cruise, great radio sounds, daytime running lights, fog lights, rear opening glass, plastic on the back of the back of the back seats when the seats are folder down for hauling. Storage pockets everywhere, in the doors, center console, left side of dash, glove box, and another storage box under the gear selector. Give it a look, you won't be disappointed."
pontiac,vibe,2006,Rick, 05/24/2007,Refreshing Driver,4,"We bought the Vibe and went from the panhandle of FL to PA non stop, and at 6' and 275lbs and a bad back I knew I was inviting trouble. Not at all! Got out of the car and felt great. Turned around and drove back to FL and then to IL. Seat adjustments are great! 30 mpg at 75 mph and much better in town. Traded in a '97 Grand Prix and although I miss the HP of the V6 this is not bad in town. On the highway it needs additional spunk. When in cruise it continually wants to downshift to go over the overpasses, so I disengage the cruise and manually feed it the gas before I get to the hill. Lots of standard options. Good feel and versatile. We tinted the windows though."
pontiac,vibe,2006,Old Sarge, 06/11/2007,I have 2 Vibes,4,"Fun and easy to drive. Its real easy to get excited about this car. It gets great rating all around. Some times I take for granted how good a car it is until I have to drive something else. I dont know why some experts say its underpowered. With 4 passengers and luggage it may have a little trouble getting uphill, but other than that its 130 or so horses has plenty of giddyup. The experts also say the steering wheel is too far to reach. I have short arms, its not a problem.  "
pontiac,vibe,2006,Dave Baker, 10/10/2007,Good Changeover,4,"We've owned a Caravan (V6)for the past 18 years and decided to try something with better gas mileage. So far we are very pleased with the switch. The Vibe seems to be comparible on interstate as far as power goes, gas mileage was 34 mpg on our first road trip and the passenger and driver compartment was more comfortable than the van. There was actually more leg & foot room. The only downfall is the cargo space but we hope to take advantage of the roof rack for that. Finding crossbars for the roof rack on a Vibe seems to be a challenge. I should have gotten a Vibe years ago."
pontiac,vibe,2006,TeeDubb, 07/12/2007,Feeling the Vibe,4,"My Vibe was a leftover new 2006 I found on a local lot in May 2007. I replaced my ancient 1993 4Runner with the Vibe and I couldn't be happier. Tons of interior space (as much as my old truck), lots of storage cubbies, surprisingly peppy engine (though a little noisy when it gets into higher RPM) and aggressive, sporty styling (much cooler than the Matrix).  After about 1700 miles, I'm very pleased with my purchase. "
pontiac,vibe,2006,rbrazil, 10/20/2007,My first Pontiac,4,"I do a lot of stop and go driving and this car keeps me happy zipping from place to place.  One annoying thing is the button below the steering column, I bump my knee on it (I'm a short legged gal and I like the steering wheel up close).  Also, it's a long reach back to turn the overhead light on and off.  Great space in the back, like the way the window will open separately from the hatch.   No OnStar, which would have been nice. The hood prop broke almost immediately.  Otherwise it's a fun car, great looks, great gas mileage, love the sunroof!"
pontiac,vibe,2006,Sctbyd, 03/27/2008,Alomost 2 years and still got the vibe!!,5,"This is a great car. Me and my wife have had this car for almost 2 years now and have had not one problem yet. Have 37,000 miles on it, from going to L.A.(Disneyland) at least 11 times since we bought it. Nothing to complain about very roomy and very comfortable. Tested not filling up once going from San Fran to LA and got there with some fumes left to spare (trip miles were 410!!!) seems to get better gas mileage as the years pass."

Although I love my Chevy Silverado, I knew that I was going to need an fuel efficient vehicle or go broke trying to keep the truck filled up.  I did a lot of research and of all the cars that fit this category, I found the Vibe a very good buy.  I've owned my 2006 for over a year now and have no complaints at all.  As mentioned above, I am 6'8"" and still have as much head room in the Vibe as I do in my pick-up.  The only reservation that I do have is the placement of the Automatic Transmission console which restricts my right leg a bit.   Overall, this is a very nice car and I will probably purchase another if the need arises."
pontiac,vibe,2006,Elise, 02/03/2020,It’s really reliable,5,"Only pain in the butt problem I can recall so far is the catalytic converter code at 170,000 miles which needs to be repaired. Not bad. I’ve put my vibe through so much and it has been so good to me for how long I’ve had it. I’ve even been able to comfortable sleep it in on a road trip. It’s so spacious for the front passengers.

pontiac,vibe,2006,bkelly, 04/10/2008,Throw away car!,2,I have had nothing but problem after problem with my Vibe.  I am so very sorry that I purchased this car.  I hadn't had the car a week and had a problem with the brakes.  I was told it was because I live on a dirt road.  How funny.  Dirt roads have been around forever.  It was a metal shard they found after much insistence. Many other problems exist as well.
pontiac,vibe,2006,nhollins, 08/20/2006,2006 AWD,3,"My new Vibe replaces a 12 year old Sunbird. I thought the 1.8l engine would be a headache on the freeway. Surprise for me !  The rpm's are only at 3200 to go 130km/hr. The 4 valve/cylinder is the only way to go ,to make a sensor controlled engine function to its best. I had TrimLine install a hoodshield thats 24"" wide ; 1/2 way up the hood. I had a 74 Corolla that ran troublefree for 10years. So as soon as i found out the Vibe had a Toyota motor , i ordered a new Vibe. What a happy newcar owner i am, considering this is the 1st vehicle bought without even a testdrive !"
pontiac,vibe,2006,action_nad, 02/19/2013,"A decent car, no more, no less.",3,"Not the fastest car I have ever had, but not the slowest.
Does alright on gas, around 27 mpg by my measurements, but coupled with a very small tank means a lot of stops at the gas station.
Interior on the base model is cheap looking, and driving can get uncomfortable after a couple of hours for tall people.
All in all, not a bad little go kart, but you can do better."
pontiac,vibe,2006,magic10fingers, 02/22/2011,Not a vehicle to buy if you live where it snows,2,"I purchased my 2006 Vibe in October of 2010 and have had nothing but trouble with it. This car handles horribly in midwest winters. It has newer tires, just no traction on or in snow and rain. I went in a complete circle turning a corner 1 day and I was barely moving because the snow was fresh and could tell the Vibe wasn't handling well. I was having issues with my key not working in the ignition back in November, and just got a letter on February 19 2011 there is a safety recall with my car. I wouldn't have known about the recall because it wasn't discovered until Aug of 2010 and I bought it in October. Letters didn't start going out until January 14th 2011. Shakes on windy days."

It is VERY quick but, when I carefully checked the gas milage it was an impressive 25.7 mpg. This was a combination of highway/city and fun O:) driving. Of course if you are going to constantly get on the motor you are going to be rewarded with less gas milage (power comes from somwhere).I read some articles that said the GT didnt have alot of low end power. However, my 2006 model came equiped with a transaxle gear ratio of 4:53. This low gear ratio allows the motor to get up into its high end powerband rather quickly. "
pontiac,vibe,2006,Alyson, 01/12/2007,Fun little car,4,"This is a great little car.  I like that the inside is significantly larger than the outside appears.  It is quite peppy and comfortable.  I typically drive between 500 and 1000 miles/week, and I love the gas mileage I average (31-33mpg).  I bought mine with all of the bells and whistles that Pontiac offers - upgraded sound system, roof, leather, etc, but would like to see seat warmers and electric seats."

But I still enjoy driving it. Good quality for the dollar. Gets good mileage. Like the dash layout and large cargo area. Generally pleased with Vibe. Have had problems with the ""idle"". The engine wants to race after warm up. Had to remove back seat head rest because of blind stop. But all bell and whistle still work.  Needs telescoping wheel for more comfort. Cup holders are only for one person at a time. But if I had a choose I would by my 3nd Vibe.   "

I love the gas mileage I get with my Vibe.  And I love the fact that I don't have to 'crawl' in and out of my car (bad back).  Very roomy and spacious, can carry quite a load.  I have not had any problems with my Vibe either, that's a big +. Very happy with my car 1.5 years later."

I have moved with this car, taken extensive vacations in this car, and well, everyone is looking for a car that gets good gas mileage, thinking it never existed, well I still get 34 mpg. all the time!

It replaced an Isuzu Amigo which was pure joy for 11 years. With the Vibe you get sensibleness - good gas mileage, surprising cargo capability, and a slightly higher (for a small car) seat height. Despite its sporty appearance, it's no sports car, and it could use a little more power for mad city traffic. But when you figure in the good mileage, it's generally worth the trade off.  "
pontiac,vibe,2006,dgranros, 03/03/2009,My 2006 Vibe,4,"Bought my Vibe with 24,000 well maintained miles on it. I traded in a PT Cruiser which I dearly loved but constant electrical /quality issues finally forced me to move on.  My Vibe has been a joy, absolutely bulletproof and delivers a steady 30 -31 mpg in combined city/ highway driving. The Vibe does have considerable road and wind noise (at least compared to the PT). The cars handling is quite good and acceleration is decent with the automatic. Not especially fast but ok for my needs.  I like the older (pre '09) Vibes for the side molding and fairings. Should offer some protection in the parking lot wars. Certainly better than the 09's which haven't any side protection at all."
pontiac,vibe,2006,cwg292, 07/16/2009,RELIABLE GAS CONSUMER,4,"Bought car for 13000 out the door in 2008. Could not be happier with reliability and mpgs. Averages 28-30 in town, 33-35 highway. Not a performer though very practical. A little noisy and under powered. Plenty of room for a small family. If performance doesn't matter to your driving needs, this is a perfect car."
pontiac,vibe,2006,ikeinpgh, 11/29/2009,Car is bulletproof,4,"Bought the car over 3 years ago new.  Don't drive it as much as I would like, because I have too other cars.  This car is so pratical, its not even funny.  I use it mostly in the summer to haul my two kayaks around. I can get one kayak inside with the front seat folded down and still close the hatch.  Amazing. I bought the GM crossbars and have two kayak holders for the top most of the time.  Gas mileage is around 30 all the time. Haven't got much more than 33. I think its because of the cross bars and the fact that I don't have many miles on it. Looking forward to many more trouble free miles.  Only complaints are the plastic body cladding is coming off around the back wheel wells. "
pontiac,vibe,2006,Greg Halford, 12/09/2009,One Fantastic Ride,5,I owned a 2005 Vibe since 2006. It had 21000 miles on it when I bought it. I drove that car for 3+ years and had the mileage up to 112000 when Bambi took me out of the race. I was sooo mad.. There was no thinking about it and I went right out and bought another one. I loved the first one and I'm still loving the second one. Other than normal maintenance I've never had either car in for any problems.!! Just oil and filters and replacing the tires. You can not go wrong with a Vibe !! Too bad that Pontiac is going out of busines as this particular type of Pontiac is a sure-fire winner. I will be sure to purchase another one before you can't find them anymore.

Still under extended warranty for a few more months. Fuel economy great! Hit a deer in 07 and dented it up, got it fixed and back on the road. Since the trade in has gone through the basement, I'm keeping her until the wheels fall off. Got a 1995 Isuzu Rodeo to drive in winter now.

pontiac,vibe,2006,Hank Smith, 02/06/2008,Good MPG - Piece of Garbage,3,"I should have run far far away. The day I bought my base model 2006 Vibe we drive it off the lot and within 10 miles the engine overheats and spills coolant all over the place..needless to say we took it back to the dealer and they graciously exchanged it for another. So for about 20,000 it has been a good little car and then today it dies on me and I have to have it towed to the dealer. I am not real happy. 18 months and this little piece of crap leaves me stranded on the highway. I thought I was buying Toyota quality but it's just another California bulit pile of garbage. Depending on what is wrong with this car I am going to buy a Honda. I hate this car."
pontiac,vibe,2006,lbalb, 02/07/2008,So far so good,4,I purchased my Pontiac Vibe in 2006. I have yet to have a problem with it. It has been an extremely reliable car. Not one problem to report. It seems that the car gets better gas mileage as it gets older. I am averaging around 31 miles per gallon on highway which is most of my time. 
pontiac,vibe,2006,paintballove, 03/08/2011,Good little car.,4,"It's a functional wagon. Good MPGs, but with any car it's all in how you drive it. The 5spd manual is fairly fun. The steering is responsive and effective. It won't win awards for looks, but I bought her at 88,000 miles and hope to keep it until it dies. You really don't discover the usefulness in having a wagon until you own one. The stereo layout looked too 90s. Not acceptable for a car made in 2006."
pontiac,vibe,2006,annie, 08/28/2005,My first Pontiac @ 57,5,"I purchased this car on July 5th,2005.The salesman searched the entire state until he found a model I requested:5-speed, loaded with everything but ABS.  I am completely happy with my purchase, and can reccomend it to anyone who values fuel economy; a spunky engine; and a high  cuteness factor.  All of the options I requested are just what one would expect and hope for: they work,and they look good doing it.  One more thing: I have four dogs(big ones) and there is plenty of room when the rear seats are down.And I think it could even be used for camping(sans dogs) for me and my squeeze.Lots and lots of room. I love this car."
pontiac,vibe,2006,Remi , 01/05/2006,Great runabout,4,"We switched from a 5th wheel to a motorhome, and needed a small car to tow behind. The Vibe combines the japanese reliability with american style. It is fun to drive and great on gaz compared to my GMC 2500. The interior is roomy and flexible - I can put my bikes inside, which I could not in the Toyota Yaris I considered. The seats are comfy and the controls are well placed. I bought a set of 15 Inch Corolla rims along 195/65-15 snow tires - they fit perfectly - and I am having fun in the snow. With the various rebates, the Vibe came in at a lower price than the Toyota Matrix. This 57 years old owner is fully satisfied with his new toy!"
pontiac,vibe,2006,Herb, 02/25/2006,Great Little car,4,Got 30 mpg on the first tank and looking for better as I break it in. Fun to drive and handles great on the Highway. Engine performs very well ( Heck.... it's a Toyota ) Not a complaint yet. Love passing up gas stations. 
pontiac,vibe,2006,Jim, 03/13/2006,Great Little Workhorse,4,"76,000 miles and more than a few scratches and it still elicits positive remarks on its looks.  The Pontiac is more attractive than the Toyota version. It can haul so much. Mine is a working vehicle. Very well designed for this. Love the permanent tie-downs, wish there were more. moveable tie-downs not as well designed as they might be, but I use them. I like it in white, but wish it had black bumpers to not show the scratches so much.  Great car!"
pontiac,vibe,2006,james c, 04/06/2006,FUN (LITTLE) CAR,4,Accelerates / Handles nicely - only beef - wish it rode a little bit more quietly.  Has more styling / options available than the Toyota Matrix ... even though they are considered sister vehicles.
pontiac,vibe,2006,Lee Blanton, 05/10/2006,2nd Vibe,4,"We just bought our 2nd Vibe! The ride quality, solid feel, gas mileage and cargo capacity of my wife's Vibe just couldn't be beat. I drove a base front wheel drive but it just didn't have the same solid feel. We bought our first Vibe last year in April and have been very pleased. Great cars and fun to drive!"
pontiac,vibe,2006,Alaska Gal, 05/31/2006,"Love it, way less $ than another Outback",5,"Got it last week after ten years of Outbacks... less $, no heated seats or mirrors, but peppy, a little more noisy but more room for rear passengers, lots of pizzazz, better braking distance, WAY better price. Still have '00 Outback SW. Only tows 1500, vs. 2700 now for OUtback, and 2200 when I bought mine,....but I did not get it to tow. 28.5 mpg last tank of gas ;D, about 25 my first... I usually get city avg mileage from EPA, 21 or 22 avg on Outback; 15 avg summer on Chev Trlblazer EXT."
pontiac,vibe,2006,roggatz, 06/03/2006,good,4,"wife loves it.  easy to drive, could use a little more room in the rear cargo area"
pontiac,vibe,2006,alma, 07/02/2006,good little car,5,i have 3400 miles on my vibe  no trouble at all for the money i couldn't beat it  over 30 mpg every tank
pontiac,vibe,2006,snoey, 07/13/2006,Very good car,4,"I went from a Grand Prix to the Vibe. I wanted better gas mileage (which I got) but plenty of storage room. Overall I love the vehicle. I'm averaging 30 miles to the gallon and think it could get better. There are 3 things that I miss from the Grand Prix that I think Pontiac should make standard: stereo controls on the steering wheel, power drivers-side seats, and the radio that stays on even after you shut the car off (until you open the door). I am surprised at how much I miss those features. "
pontiac,vibe,2006,lovemyvibe, 07/21/2006,new vibe owner,5,I've had my Vibe now for a whole 3 weeks and I love it!!  I have owned 3 other new cars since my Vibe and not one compare to the comfort and reliabilty of the Vibe.  Best practical car out there.
pontiac,vibe,2006,Bob, 08/20/2006,Good Little Car,4,"I switched to a vibe after owning a Dodge Ram 1500, mainly because of the gas mileage.  I really enjoy this little car better than I expected.  I forgot how fun it is to drive a car.  I'm a big guy (6'4"" 310 lbs) and this car has plenty of room for me.  I love all the storage compartments everywhere.  If you're in the market for good gas mileage and lots of seating and cargo room, this is the car for you."
pontiac,vibe,2006,Don, 08/23/2006,What's Not To Like,5,"I recently downsized from a Ford Explorer Sport to the Vibe Base automatic, mainly for better fuel economy.  I've had it about one month now and love it.  Fun to drive, it handles well.  Passengers in front and especially the back find it much more comfortable than the 2-door SUV.  It's roughly a 1000 pounds lighter, and I sacrificed very little cargo space.  I'm tracking the gas mileage and will report that later."
pontiac,vibe,2006,mac, 10/13/2005,vibe,5,This is a fun to drive vehicle.  It has a lot of power for only 4 cylinders and has excellent fuel economy
pontiac,vibe,2006,6thmeridian, 11/03/2005,Good car for a Republican.,5,"I'd rather have a dozen root canals than buy a new car, but after returning from serving in the Peace Corps we needed dependable transportation. I researched new vehicles a lot, with economy, price, and dependability as goals. The Vibe seemed to have a lot of room and promised good mileage. We got a 2004 demo with 4,500 miles and have put 16,000 more on it in a year. Drives easy, solidly built, plenty of room, no problems at all. It's really my wife's car, but I drive on trips. We got the auto trans, I would have liked the six speed manual but of course GM won't let you have it without the turbo engine. It's been a good choice, I recommend the Vibe without reservation. I'm 57 years old."
pontiac,vibe,2006,Dan Stiel, 02/17/2006,Little but Unique,4,"I have a Lava red mono tone, preferred package, It is great on gas, but can be a little more sportier and comfortable for the driver."
pontiac,vibe,2006,Rock12, 02/22/2006,You Get What You Pay For!,4,"The thing that is really fun about the Vibe is that it sits higher than a sedan. This means that you can look into the Hummer next to you and the driver can see you smiling as you fly past the pumps because of the fuel economy. I haven't been in a domestic product for years. The only reason I bought this one was, it is a Matrix/Corolla power train, Matrix and Vibe jointly developed, and well employee pricing got the $21K sticker down to $17k. The drawbacks are the usual complaints that I have with domestic products, poor quality paint and plastics throughout. I had quite a bit of trouble initially with the transmission, although I believe this was an anomaly specific to my vehicle.  "
pontiac,vibe,2006,J DICKENS, 06/09/2006,Great second car for seniors,3,Good comfort for around town...Would not want to take a long trip as i'm a senior and want comfort.
pontiac,vibe,2006,Paul Adams, 07/14/2006,Good Car for the Money,4,"I bought the GT for the purpose of having a car with adequate power and relatively good gas mileage.  I got what I was looking for with 6-speed model; however, I'm not thrilled with shifting from 1st gear.  I have routinely checked my gas mileage and I'm averaging 28.5 which includes some city driving, and I like to move on so that is a great feature.  Once you shift from 1st gear the car is fun to drive and it handles well. Keep in mind it is recommended to use premium fuel but sometimes I have used the 89 grade and I didn't notice any running problems.  The space is nice in the cargo area, and if you need to haul you will be surprised (in a good way) of the availabe space."
pontiac,vibe,2006,moonstone, 01/29/2007,Pontiac vibe,4,"This is a great driving car. Has power on interstate driving at 75 mph. Has plenty of head room, seats are ok ?"
pontiac,vibe,2006,L. Bowers, 04/18/2008,One Heck of a Car,4,"I purchased my 06 vibe as the new 07's were coming to market.  So to say the least I got an awesome car for the price.  Mine is a 5 speed manual with the 1.8L. It has plenty of pep for a smaller engine and awesome fuel economy.  I mostly do city driving and after 7 months my MPG increased from 31 to 34. I love the cargo area and the roomy cockpit what a surprise for such a small car. I car pool with 2 of my hockey buddies and there is more then enough room for our 3 large hockey bags and sticks.  The fit and finish is a little on the weak side but what can I expect for a car under 18,000.  "
pontiac,vibe,2006,Carol Jarvinen, 08/17/2017,Love my collector's item!,4,"Sadly, this car (or any Pontiac) is no longer made, but if a used one is being considered, I highly recommend it.
"
pontiac,vibe,2007,james, 12/23/2006,this is a great car,4,pontiac did a great thing with toyota in branding the vibe as a pontiac. it's got that toyota feel and look to it. i look forward to 3 years of fun driving this baby.
pontiac,vibe,2007,Roger Kirby, 10/27/2006,Does not dissapoint,5,"I have dogs, large dogs and need to haul them around. That was the first criteria on buying the car. The dogs love it, the way it is designed they can easily hang their heads out of the window. The second was fuel economy which is good. The last reason was a car which I would find satisfying and on this score it has exceeded my expectations. Our family has a Civic, a Honda CRV and a Mustang Convertible (its a large family). This car is everyones favorite, because of its versatility. The Mustang makes a good second car, however it gets left behind for long hauls, shopping trips, taking friends out etc. The car does everything very well, without trying to the best in any one feature."
pontiac,vibe,2007,SarahG, 07/16/2015,"Great Car, but my 97' Camry was better in snow",4,"This car replaced a '97 Camry.  The only reason I replaced the Camry was lack of cargo space.  So far, it has been a great car that has been on par with my expectations.  Gets great gas mileage, holds a surprising amount of stuff and the ride height is great (somewhere between a car and an SUV).  Interior is modern and materials are cool.  The only thing I really don't like about this car is that it's not too good in snow or rain ( and this is with snow tires in the front ).  Even though it didn't have traction control, my Camry was actually quite a beast in the snow.  I was a bit bummed this past winter when I skidded out of control a few times in the Vibe.  Should've gotten the AWD version.  A good car otherwise.
"
pontiac,vibe,2007,Robert Snyder, 08/10/2006,Robert Snyder's Review,4,"I have had many, many cars in my 73 years and the Pontiac Vibe rates way at the top of My favorites.  It has excellent pickup, it can be used as a truck by laying all the seats down. The milage is always over 30 MPG. I cannot say enough good things about it.  I have had Riviera's, Roadmasters, VolksWagens Impalas, Mercurys, and numerous other automobiles in My lifetime and the Vibe is my favorite."
pontiac,vibe,2007,Northstar1, 01/06/2010,Wonderful Car,4,"I live in cold winter Western Canadian prairie climate and I am very pleased with my Vibe. Purchased new in January 2007 and I have accumulated 77,000 km (45,000 miles) in 3 full years. Absolutely no reliability issues whatsoever. FWD with manual 5 drives has always done quite well in snowy weather with aftermarket Michelin X- Ice tires. (You should never winter drive with all-seasons tires). Heater is good within 5 minutes and quite hot after 30 minutes. (Ditto for AC in summer with 33c [95F] heat). Excellent gas mileage. I like to travel in the intermountain western states. This car is an economical 'aircraft replacement vehicle' for my fun-filled long road trips. Camping is great as well. "
pontiac,vibe,2007,Matt, 08/16/2010,Great gas sipper,4,"I bought this used car with 12,000 miles on the odometer.  It now has 38,000 miles on it, including round trips from Minnesota to Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Ontario.  It gets 37 mpg, 35 with 2 bikes on the back, and 30 even in congested Toronto."
pontiac,vibe,2007,Gayle, 10/14/2006,A fun car to drive,5,"I have owned many cars in my fifty years of driving and I rate the Vibe close to the top of them. It is a fun car to drive, handles great, looks good, economical to operate and very versatile to haul stuff with. I plan on keeping this one a while."
pontiac,vibe,2007,Brenda, Minneapolis,I love my Vibe!!,5,"If you are in the market for a used 2007 Vibe, you can sleep at night knowing you've made a wise choice.  I've bought mine new almost 3 years ago, and have 41,900 miles today.  I've never had a single mechanical issue, this is the most reliable car I have ever owned.  It is a GREAT all- purpose vehicle; the roomy interior offers a HUGE amount of headroom and is great for long road trips (my son is 6'5"" and is very comfortable driving this car).  The fold-down seats and hard-coated cargo area make hauling luggage, sports equipment, etc. a breeze.  It's sporty, stylish, and the integrated roof-rack is sweet!!  PLUS the 36 mpg (hwy) rocks.  I will keep this car forever!!!"
pontiac,vibe,2007,DriveAVibe, 12/17/2009,Great Car,5,"I great car, for everyday travel or traveling long distances, however driving on gravel shakes you up real nice, and a lot of vibration coming from the dashboard area. However there is a ton of leg room in the front and back as well as several compartments, I have yet to have any problems with it, but it is difficult driving with just a few inches of snow. But as a ""soccer mom car"" I would highly recommend it!"
pontiac,vibe,2007,s. davis, 02/09/2017,Very Reliable,4,"This has been a very reliable vehicle.  I bought new and have had it almost 10 years.  Air bag  on passenger side was replaced by a recall.  No mechanical issues.  Fuel economy good.  We have hauled two bicycles with the back seat folded down.  Too bad they no longer make them.  (I no longer own the Vibe.  I traded it in last Feb (2017) for a 2016 Chevy Equinox.  I wasn't having any issues with the Vibe when I traded it in.

pontiac,vibe,2007,Greg W, 11/04/2006,MY THIRD VIBE,4,This is my third Vibe. I like its looks and versatility. It is quite roomy for its size. 
pontiac,vibe,2007,Jello, 08/13/2009,Better than Basic,3,"I bought this car as basic transportation 2 years ago, and it has exceeded my expectations.  I average 34 mpg with my 5 speed, and have gotten over 40 on the highway.  The car is cheap, and cheaply built, and I miss my Avalanche for durability and quality, but I love the gas mileage and the small size.  Even as small as it is, we never have an issue getting all our stuff in it - even when taking three boys to their football games.  Several of my friends have Vibes now, too, after seeing all the things I do with mine."
pontiac,vibe,2007,theswedish, 09/24/2006,"Reliable, a pleasure to drive",4,"The drive feels tight and controlled. The handling is superb, it loves a twisty road. The power is smooth and good on demand. It is a very easy car to drive. Radio a lot better than my new Civic's. "
pontiac,vibe,2007,Judy, 11/02/2006,Love my new Vibe,5,I've only had my Vibe for a month and I just love it. It's easy to handle and so far I get 29 mpg with mostly city driving. With the winter months just around the corner it will be interesting to see how it handles on the snow and ice. I downsized from a mini-van and although it doesn't have the passenger room I haven't found it a problem yet. We only have one child left at home so we don't need the 7 passenger capacity.
pontiac,vibe,2007,Ron Douglas, 06/26/2008,Replace your SUV with a Pontiac Vib,5,"Replace your SUV with this ca.r I'm saving money on fuel. It's got the features of my suv but smaller. The main thing is that I can tow my 16 ft bass boat with this car with no problems and still get out to my favorite fishing spots at (27.5 MPG) far away, with out spending the extra bucks on gas if your looking for a kind of small suv this would make a great choice it gets the job done so far its been very Reliable"
pontiac,vibe,2007,Chuck , 01/22/2007,What a feeling,5,"Well I must admit my wife was right! She picked out the Vibe for my next work car. We bought a Auto Sport with Sun and Sound also included was the power package. This car is awesome as 4"" of snow wasn't even a challenge. As a previous owner of a 03 Elantra GT one couldn't even start to compare the difference. I encourage everyone to have a open mind and give the Vibe a try! My only dislike is I wanted Victory Red! not Salsa "
pontiac,vibe,2007,caleb, 03/28/2007,love this car,4,well i just got this car it is a wonderful vehicle. i love it so far. gets great gas has a lot of room. i went from a jeep wrangler to the 2007 vibe best car i have owned so far a lot of fun
pontiac,vibe,2007,Mikey, 10/07/2007,Sweet Ride,5,"I bought this Pontiac Vibe used with 48,000 miles on it, and purchased an additional 48 month/50,000 mile bumper to bumper coverage warranty from my Toyota dealer. I average 27 MPG mostly highway miles, but would probably get better mileage if I did not keep the speedo at 80 miles per hour. I love the ride after driving a jittery midsize pickup truck for 6 years. I have owned cars from just about every company out there, and I can honestly say I have never been more pleased after 5000 miles of driving. This car meets all of my driving needs and then some. The fit and finish on this 48,000 mile car are still as new. I love it."
pontiac,vibe,2007,Lynn Bruza, 11/29/2016,I love this car!,5,"We have driven this car for nearly 10 years and had little to no trouble.  We did have to replace the alternator this summer.  But this car ranks number one in my book.  We've never had a car that needed so little attention.  We have had it regularly serviced and it has rewarded us with trouble free years.

pontiac,vibe,2007,Ed S/C, 11/04/2007,Poor interior design and quality,2,"I bought this car because Consumer Report recommeded it. I cancelled my subscription. The location of the air and heater controls is a nightmae with an automatic. I have large hands. :-(  Also get a scratch on the cheap plastic interior, it will never come out. I have never owed such a cheaply made car. Other than that, the paint came off, the brakes squeal, the front seat is a nightmare for comfort, Bottom line is that car really SUCKS and G/M should be ashamed to sell it. "
pontiac,vibe,2007,kitti2719, 06/20/2008,kitti2719,4,Traded my Ford Explorer in for the the Vibe and I love it - much better gas mileage and there I find I have just as much room in the Vibe as I did the Explorer.  Although I had to get to used to the front wheel drive I think it handles quite well except when next to big Trucks on the hwy you can really feel the wind pulling.  The only problems I seem to be having is with the windows wind seems to howl through drivers side and I think the seal is broken in the hatch back window
pontiac,vibe,2007,Jeremy, 12/19/2007,Reliable transportation,4,"I bought this car with 11,000 miles on it. I enjoy driving the car and like the good 35-40 mpg I am getting on the freeway. However, I do find the driver seat to be a bit uncomfortable on longer drives. I have had two service calls, one for a leaky front wind sheild and another for some weatherstrips that came loose on the passenger side window. No problems with anything mechanical.  I would recommend this car for anyone seeking good mpg and a reliable car. Open the hood and you will see that pretty much everything has Toyota Motor corp on it. Get Toyota reliability for American prices!"
pontiac,vibe,2007,Linda Goodrich, 03/07/2009,Great Car for the Price,5,I've wanted a Vibe ever since driving one through a rental agency a few years back.  I am so pleased with this car.  It's fun to drive and gets good gas mileage.  I've been driving it for nearly a year and couldn't be happier.
pontiac,vibe,2007,Scott, 01/03/2008,We Love This Car!,4,"We bought this car after struggling to find a fuel efficient wagon-esque vehicule. We looked at everything on the market, and nothing else (but the Matrix, which is kinda ugly) came close mileage-wise. It's sporty, fun to drive (I'm 36), great looking, with surprisingly large storage given the size. No problems at all after 8K miles.  "
pontiac,vibe,2007,Theresa, 06/08/2009,"Love the car, but hate the interior!!",4,"I love the vibe, but I always get shocked by the interior everytime I exit the car. And it is very rough! The gas mileage is excellent! I have no idea why but we just had to replace the computer because our check engine light was coming on and they said when it shows the code it was showing, GM said to replace the computer, so we're hoping that's not an on going problem. The brakes do squeak, but not all the time. Over all the vibe is a fun car to own!"
pontiac,vibe,2007,Commonsense, 09/21/2009,2007 Vibe: a GREAT car!,5,"I get better than 35 mpg in combined driving, most of it during rush hour.  When traffic cooperates, I get better than 38 mpg.  This car has lots of cargo space with the back seats folded down.  It's made in America, costs less, is at least as reliable (no problems so far), and gets better mileage than the competing imports"
pontiac,vibe,2007,Bethanne, 02/13/2008,I Love It!,4,"I bought this car based on reviews that I had seen on the internet. I keep my cars a long time so I wanted something that was reliable, safe and fuel efficient. I love this car!

pontiac,vibe,2007,Lori, 03/16/2007,Love my Good Vibe,5,"Had 3 Altimas in a row, so I was skeptical about a change, but I love my Vibe.  It's a great not quite as big as an SUV or as small as a sedan size, and I love how I sit a little higher off the road than my previous mid-sized sedans.  I prefer a 5 speed and the location of the stick took some adjustment, but it handles beautifully and is a thrill to drive.  Great for carrying stuff without having to go with a truck."
pontiac,vibe,2007,VTBear, 04/16/2007,Just what I needed,4,"First 2k miles no problems. Average 34 mpg, handles great, good all around visibility. Live on a dirt/mud road, makes it home daily. Instruments well placed, shifter as well. Back OK for preteens, not bigger. No frills, don't need 'em. Fuel savings annually over last car will be about 3 payments per year at today's gas price. Quiet for such a small car. "
pontiac,vibe,2007,Linda, 04/02/2007,Love It,5,"I love this car. Very versatile and practical, but still cute and fun. Just returned from a road trip and it felt solid and controlled on the interstate. Very maneuverable around town."
pontiac,vibe,2007,elaine, 04/11/2007,The most fun I've had driving a car,4,"I looked at every car with this body style, ie: Aveo, Matrix, Spectra5. This car is so fun. I feel like I'm in an SUV because I sit up so high. The interior has more room than my 4 door sedan but the body is about 4ft smaller. Acceleration is steady, braking not too hard. I've drive 160 miles and used a bit more than a qtr. tank. I do not have the engine noise that I've read about in some reviews. Maybe I'm just not that spoilt. I drove a lot of cars and read a lot of reviews...this is the car I bought. Even with it's little quirks, in my opinion even with the expensive cars out there, the reliability and reviews prove this to be the car to pick. "
pontiac,vibe,2007,kadog, 05/03/2007,Gas Mileage!,4,"Great car overall. Looked for about a year. Just had a baby so needed something 4 door with room and great gas mileage. Did not want a minivan. Only have 2k miles on it, so far no problems other than a slight rattle on the dash from plastic piece vibrating loose? Hence the 7 on build quality. Hesitant to buy Pontiac, my dad was a Grand Am fanatic and they always had problems, don't know why he kept buying them. Found out it was basically a Toyota Matrix and I was sold. Like the sportier look  of the Pontiac, better warranty also."
pontiac,vibe,2007,peter a stasio, 04/30/2007,Love my Vibe,5,"I love it. It's fun, and accerates quickly. The 5 speed feature makes it great on the highway. Mayybe not in Germany compared to the BMW or the Mercedes, but I wouldn't trade it for the world."
pontiac,vibe,2007,randy, 07/11/2007,The Vibe is a nice car for retired folks,5,"I have about 3200 miles driven and am well pleased with the vehicle. I researched and test drove many vehicles. This car met the needs of our family. My wife and I are recently retired and went down to only one car. The Vibe gives us a roomy interior for carring home groceries and for hauling materials for my home inprovement projects. The gas mileage is pretty much on target. I do lose about 2.5 MPG when I use the air and also when the air temp. drops below freezing. The head room is amazing, I am 6'-3"" and even with a sun roof there is more than I need. Leg and hip room are also quite adequate.The Vibe seem to handle very well and the engine is responsive. The style is also great.   "

pontiac,vibe,2007,IrishOne, 09/29/2007,Functional work vehicle,4,"I work out of this car. I get 34 MPG overall including thruway miles at 72 mph and mountain roads. I'm a big guy, 5'11'' and 280 pounds, there is plenty of headroom and overall the drivers seat is comfortable. I do start to get uncomfortable after 7 hours in the car or trips over 150 miles without getting out. I put the back seats down and carry a full load of product in plastic containers. My product is very light so I don't know how it would be for heavy loads. This model is FWD, not AWD.  AWD was not available in the 2007 Vibe, you would have to buy the Toyota version.  Mileage is very important to me and overall, I am very happy with this car."
pontiac,vibe,2007,Craig, 07/03/2007,Economically Fit,4,"This is a great car for anyone at the age of 24 to the age of 55. I can get  28 miles per gallon driving on the highway/around town, which is good for a crossover car. I am more impressed by the space inside. The other day I went surfing, and I fit my 9'6"" surfboard all the way in the Vibe with the back hatch shut. It is also very stylish. One negative comment would be road noise while driving on the freeway. It can get quite loud compared to my old Infiniti I used to drive. Other than that, this car packs a big punch for the price tag and I feel Pontiac will keep making the vibe for many more years to come."
pontiac,vibe,2007,erif, 08/31/2007,No wonder Pontiac is in trouble,3,"We bought this car in January and put alot of miles on it, so far 21,000. We have had 3 sets of tires due to cupping. Pontiac did cover the cost but faught us on finding the cause. The result was the rear alighnment was out by 1.5 degrees. Tires cupped in 3,000 miles. Fit and finish wehn delivered was bad also. Then the icing on the cake... We had a passenger side floor that was flooded. And what did Pontiac say? It was normal to have some water enter the passenger compartment when going through a car wash with high p.s.i. water or heavy rain! I could not believe they said it was a normal occurance. They offered no fix, we are getting rid of this car and going back to Toyota!"
pontiac,vibe,2007,Marty, 07/12/2007,Fun Little car to drive,5,"I test drove cars for 6 months before I saw my Pontiac Vibe. When I saw it I thought this is perfect for me and my kids. They have school activities, and I can go shopping and still have room for everything  else. Great gas mileage as well. "
pontiac,vibe,2007,Rick Zitarosa, 10/19/2007,Great Car/Fun to Drive,5,"This car is used for commuting and social functions with family/friends. Great utility, economy and purpose in design, sporty appearance and very ""fun"" to drive.  Many owners of more expensive ""crossover"" vehicles are shocked at the reasonable price.  The Pontiac Vibe is a definite winner and it has been pleasurable to drive and completely trouble-free for the 13,000 miles I have owned it so far.  Ideal as a commuter, work or family car, it has something for everyone."
pontiac,vibe,2007,Linda Kauffman, 03/06/2008,Viben it down the road,5,"When we had some bad snow storms come thru in the last two months, this Vibe did awesome. It handled the snow as if it was a 4x4. This is a good fuel economy car to own."
pontiac,vibe,2007,fredonia dave, 03/18/2008,Id buy it again,5,"great gas mileage, good looks, loads of interior room, good in snow and wind.   Fast acceleration for a cheap car.  Pulls a small trailer with no effort.  I'm proud to be a 37 year old male driving my little old lady car.  Almost 7000 miles and no major problems."
pontiac,vibe,2007,lovin it, 03/31/2008,"So far, so good",4,"Love mine and love fuel economy, averaging 27.5 mpg city.  Seats fold down easy and lots of storage/hauling room.  Good acceleration when needed.  Will keep this fuel efficient hard worker for a long time."
pontiac,vibe,2007,JI, 12/12/2007,A surprisingly good family car,4,"Absolutely love this car. This is our primary family vehicle for a family of four and a labrador retriever.  The Vibe is a comfortable car to drive and be a passenger in. I am surprised by the amount of backseat room in this car. This car is getting about 35 mpg on the highway, if not more, and it only costs about $40 a week in gas, driving 24000 km a year. Easy to get around the city in and a breeze to park. I would buy another one for sure, can't wait for the 2009 model."
pontiac,vibe,2007,Robin, 04/15/2008,07 Vibe,5,"Great car. Has over 30,000 miles and no problems. Roomier than what you would think when you see it and comfortable. "
pontiac,vibe,2007,bobbo, 04/21/2008,Great car,4,"Ironically I was looking at the Matrix as my final choice. I play the drums so hauling my kit was a big factor. When I saw the room with the seats down I was most impressed. I've put 25,000 miles on and have no complaints, in fact when I told the service mgr I was looking at a Toyota he said"" Well this IS a matrix with a Vibe body. I'm getting between 33 and 36 mpg consistently in combo driving."
pontiac,vibe,2007,Paul, 04/22/2008,smart choice,4,I purchased my 2007 Vibe after testing and researching the usual segment competition and the car has been everything I expected. City/combined mileage has averaged 27+ and more on the freeway in short trips. I really only wanted the base model with an automatic trans and power group added for convenience- so had to search local dealer inventories instead of taking the more expensive models with options I didn't want or need. I found just what I was looking for and after 5 months of ownership the car has been great with no problems. Quality seems good.
pontiac,vibe,2007,JaCarpenter, 05/04/2008,Mediocre Car,2,"The car is competent. Nothing more, nothing less. It handles well but not great, fits a good but not great amount of stuff, and gets decent but not great gas mileage.  The engine is a real weak point. It is very loud but furnishes little power with the autobox. I live up in the Four Corners area so am often above 6000 or 7000 feet. It has a lot of trouble gaining speed on even moderate inclines at altitude. With the AC on or full up with people sometimes it has trouble keeping the same speed.  I think the dash design is poor. It looks nice enough but the chrome gauges reflect on the windshield in any sunlight. Its very visible and very annoying. The interior materials are adequate though. "
pontiac,vibe,2007,Ray, 05/11/2008,2007 Vibe,4,"I purchased the Vibe with having our first born and for the gas mileage. I've put 27k miles on it so far with no problems. Getting around 34 mpg, with 28 mpg in the winter. Like other Pontiacs it is noisy on the highway and wish there was a bit more leg room. But overall I'm very satisfied. Handles great and looks good for a wagon. Very versatile as I can put a variety of stuff inside it."
pontiac,vibe,2007,nanalehew, 05/16/2008,"Love it, Love it, Love it!",5,"I've been driving a 1998 Dodge Ram truck for 10 years purchased new.  Never minded the 17 mpg till last year driving 40 miles one-way to work everyday.  Finally decided it was time to look at fuel efficiency.  Did all my research and honestly I reluctantly purchased my Vibe just because I really didn't want to drive a car again after driving a truck for so long.  I have about 12,000 miles on my Vibe now after 6 months of ownership. Never had less than 30 mpg off the dealer lot.  Average 30-35 in combo driving.  All I can say now is that I LOVE MY VIBE!  Roomy, fuel efficient, smooth riding, no mechanical issues so far.  Road noise is a little more than expected, but no complaints.  LOVE IT!!"
pontiac,vibe,2007,edinde, 12/12/2007,Great little wagon,4,"Bought this vehicle in Oct '07 after looking at many different cars.  Took it on 770 mile trip within 1st week and was surprised at the mileage at the speeds I was driving (75-85mph).  Averaged 32.5 at 80-85 34.5 at 70-75.  Handled great and enjoyed the height adjustment feature on the drivers seat.  I purposely ordered the 5spd because of my good luck with my '92 Camry with the same setup and almost the same gas milage but over 200,000 miles  on the car.  Still drive the Camry to work everyday but the milage concerns me on a trip, therefore the vibe purchase.  Love the way you can use the interior for even long items.  Hope I can say the same for this car in 16years and 200k later."

pontiac,vibe,2008,Breeze, 09/28/2009,So good I bought it twice!,5,"I bought my 1st Vibe in 2003. I  loved it. I am a park ranger but grew up in the city, this car was the best of both! It has nice style for the city yet it was perfect when I moved to Yellowstone. The back has ample space to fit all sorts of gear and the roof rack adds extra space. Front pass. seat flips down so when I bought 10 foot 2X4's they fit perfectly. Even if they had been longer I would not worry cause back window pops open! While traveling X country I recharged by AA batt. using the 2 prong outlet in dashboard. After hiking I throw my dirty boots in the trunk & never worry about a mess cause it is durable plastic. Never had a prob. In June I got 2008, gave 2003 to mom- she loves it"
pontiac,vibe,2008,all_pr, 05/24/2012,best in its class,4,"I never owned this vehicle but was assigned one of the 4 owned by the place i used to work.I got it with less than 50 miles basically brand new i used to drove 200 up to 500 miles daily and have to say this car was great in every way.

First lets call things by their name this is a 4 cylinder economy base car you can't expect great acceleration or killer looks or comforts found in luxury cars.I put 108k miles in 14 months besides oil changes(cheap oil by the way every 7500 miles) and wiper blades it never gave any problem if that is not reliable i don't know what it is.Even the tires it came with lasted for about 13 months.Sometimes i question the ability of some people to review cars."
pontiac,vibe,2008,Burns1210, 06/28/2008,Who approved the '09 design?,4,"I've had the Vibe for a month and I'm liking it so far. As mentioned in other reviews, it seriously needs a telescoping steering wheel. The despicably low center arm rest can be replaced with a Corolla arm rest for much better comfort. The roof rack- less roof rack makes no sense. The cross bars used to be standard. Have to unscrew the antenna to use it anyway. The upgrade stereo is nice, so are the alloys. I like the head rest positioning, never had a car that I could actually rest my head on the head rest while driving. Plenty of rear seat room, and cargo carpet and bungee tie-downs are a must-have. Getting 32-34 mpg using 10% ethanol."
pontiac,vibe,2008,JMWDC, 12/29/2015,"70k miles, no issues",5,"This car is outstanding. We also own a 4 years newer, $10,000 more expensive Subaru and the Vibe blows that car out of the water in nearly every area. Two things that I'd like to see better on the Vibe would be: better snow/ice handling. If you don't have the ABS option and live in a snowy/icy climate it's a little bit of a lightweight car. The second would be acceleration, as the Vibe seems a bit underpowered. When I put the gas to the floor for a quick highway onramp, for example, it's a veryyyy slowwww acceleration.

But otherwise it's a fantastic car. The reliability is absurd, especially for what you might hear about Pontiac, I've never had to do any non-routine repairs. I attribute that to the joint-venture with Toyota (all of the guts of this car are Toyota with the superior trimmings/finishing touches of American manufacturers - really the best of both worlds).

They redid this car for the 2009 model year and the newer Vibe I found displeasing. The sightlines of my 2008 are outstanding but they shrunk the rear window and some others are harder to see out of in the newer ones. All in all I have no complaints, I could see this being a 150,000+ mile car at the rate it's going.
"
pontiac,vibe,2008,Danny Boy, 08/13/2017,Rides better than larger cars,5,"This car has great fuel economy and plenty of power.  The fold down seats and accommodating hatch allows me to put down movers blankets and haul things.  The good quality seat construction and the well-designed suspension give it a surprisingly comfortable ride for a car this size.  I am confident that the car will still be quite usable when I give it to my grandson to use for college in 2029!

Acceleration is not great, but not bad.  Road holding is great.  Just turned 200,000 miles without major repairs, mostly brakes and 2 recalls.

Had some tires that were so noisy I thought it was front bearings.

pontiac,vibe,2008,Tom Schulte, 06/10/2018,GREAT CHEAP RELIABLE,5,"Unfortunately Pontiac isn't making them anymore. I got a consistant 30 miles to the gallon hiway (don't drive city enough to care). Engine (Toyota Matrix) lasted 244500 miles and cost less than 3.5K to replace. Eats headlights, paint job not that good. Lots of cargo space. Original radio not so good but easily replaced. Tire sensor computer component is generically inferior.

We like the Vibe styling better the the Matrix.  We have the base model with no options, it's perfect for us.  It is a undertaking to make sure all 5 doors are locked.  Good power/gearing.  A/C seems on the light side.  Can't turn off head lights at night!  Check the vibe forums to find out how to turn off seat belt beep for passenger seat (if you put a backpack on the passenger seat it will loudly beep at you.  Blind spots are bad, buy blind spot mirrors.  Nice stock tires.  Lots of cool little storage areas.  Love how the seats fold down.  Liked 08 better than 09.  "
pontiac,vibe,2008,organic gardening business owner, 05/19/2018,A car with heart--it would go forever it seems,5,"Given the snow and curving hills where I live I should have bought the 4wd model. It was with sadness I said good-by to my 10 year old car. It had a lot more to give, , had good body condition, handled well, and was very reliable until the end. The end was caused because it was failing Vermont state inspection due to the evaporative system sensors. I doubt I'll ever have a car with such good mileage, good design, and reliability.

Very comfortable, good all-round visibility and comfort - even for tall people.  Respectable economy & cost, sensible maintenance coats - nothing to complain about.  I have tools and bulky kit to drive around with, and with its 2x side doors access, I find this vehicle 10x better than a truck.  I would strongly recommend this vehicle - perhaps especially for a New driver who does not want maintenance/repair surprises.

I am experiencing a few rattles in the cabin during acceleration that gets louder the harder you push the small 1.8 L.  Sunroof is disappointing, 2 visits to the dealer has made the leaking almost stop.  Versatility of fold down seats and cargo capacity are spectacular."
pontiac,vibe,2008,chipvic, 03/11/2008,Poor gas mileage,4,"Bought this to save on gas mileage, commuting 1 hour a day to work Hwy. I'm only getting 25 mph, sticker says 26-31 and am not happy. We planned on traveling and  using luggage carrier ( we unfortunately discovered rails  to hold carrier don""t come with car so you need to spend extra to buy that) but where to put carrier as radio antennae is on roof? I do like driving it tho, not sure if we will keep car tho with gas mileage poor."
pontiac,vibe,2008,Jerry - Bloomington, 07/13/2008,First Time Owner,5,"The visibility, fuel economy and cargo space for us is outstanding. GM is missing the boat by not promoting it more on TV.  The joint venture between Toyota and GM is  evident regarding the motor and drivetrain quality. Our experience in wind, rain and snow has been good. Vehicle has good heater and air conditioning. Can't afford a convertible so the sunroof gives us our fresh air fix.  We have driven it on 500 mile trips and at 2600 rpm it is just whispering down the road.  Sitting comfort for 2-3 hours at a time was excellent. The car is only half of our joy. The other half is the dealer who takes care of it for us. Most of our driving is in the city but I would recommend it to anyone. "

Only thing is the enlinks went bad on the car while still under warrenty and the dealer will not fix. This is not a mark against the car but a mark agaist the dealership!"
pontiac,vibe,2008,99evo, 06/08/2008,From a Dodge Ram to a Vibe? Great car!,5,"We looked at cars for over a month and decided on the Vibe. It has plenty of room for me(6'-2"") and my wife(5'- 10""). It has good looks, great fuel mileage, and comfort all in one affordable package. Great for weekend trips as it has plenty of room for all our things. Overall a great car."
pontiac,vibe,2008,Kay, 06/23/2008,Hatchback Problem,4,"As you can see from our ratings, we are enjoying the comfort and gas mileage of our Vibe.  However, we are experiencing one problem other Vibe owners do not seem to be having: a poor fitting hatchback.  We live on a dirt road and dust accumulates inside the hatchback top, bottom and side ridges.  Moisture, leaves,  and twigs also are in evidence when it rains.  Daylight is seen through the top of the hatchback when it is closed.  This is either a poor design or a fabrication error.  We intend to pursue this problem directly with General Motors as the dealership was unresponsive."
pontiac,vibe,2008,Cheesy Chic, 07/10/2008,Great car!,5,I commute several miles each way and this is the perfect car for me! It's very roomy and comfortable! Not to mention not that bad with gasoline.

I threw a beach cruiser bike in the back with no trouble, plenty of room, didn't even put the front seat down! Had an antenna ipod adapter installed so I can play my iPOD...yay! ONLY thing I am not thrilled about is that I did not get white!  This color (a blue-green) shows every speck of dust! And the Black-Charcoal interior is just dumb...draws heat and shows every hair, dirt , etc. I got cream seat covers and has made a difference."
pontiac,vibe,2008,Rocketman, 11/13/2008,All around great,5,"Only problem I've had was the auto trans not shifting into the next gear at the end of a 550 mile trip, but that could have been the terrain. The seats are nice and hug you so that if you drive sporty you wont slide off on sharp turns. Tons of space if you need it. I got a loaded sun and sound, auto, preferred, monotone 08 Vibe for 18K out the door because they redesigned them for 2009 and pushing the 2008's out. Get a 2008 if you can!

It is used as a commuter and vacationing vehicle - it has great fuel economy and comfort for long trips.

pontiac,vibe,2008,Skeets, 01/02/2009,Is this really an American Car,5,"I guess I picked the fully loaded version GT, which has everything everyone wants. In comparison to my Ford Explorer, it is small but roomy. Handles pretty well in wet and slick conditions as long as I don't try to put her on test by making sharp turns. Traction control is awsome, kept me straight on the road in past snowy days. It is not designed by Toyota but GM and Toyota has several projects done together under the name of Nummi. Just like Ford had been building Mercurry Villager and Nissan Quests on the same assembly line but general public does not know the inside facts."

pontiac,vibe,2008,dross, 02/03/2008,Review 2008 Vibe,4,"I was attracted to this car for its potential for versatility and gas mileage.  I have owned it for a little over a month, and have been very happy with it so far.  It has a fair amount of pep, but will never be mistaken for a six cylinder.  To me this is a fair trade-off for the great gas mileage.  My average mileage has been 26 MPG with heavy city driving.  The steering is responsive on dry pavement and the car is very predictable driving in the snow.  This car is a great car to run around town with your kids or take a trip"
pontiac,vibe,2008,Jay Larson, 03/25/2008,A great versatile economical fun car,5,"This is proof that you can get great fuel economy without buying a hybrid. drives like a sports car, handles well carries our big Bernese mtn. dogs lots of cargo space even for 8 ft. lumber. the vibe is in my opinion much better, and sportier looking than than the Toyota Matrix version. I get consistently 34 to 36 mpg. which gives me around a 400 mile range I average 37 mpg with non-ethanol gas. It handles well in the snow with the front wheel drive and my manual transmission (which I had to search for) I traded a gas guzzling trailblazer for it and the vibe is just as much fun to drive. I love this car and would definitely considering buying another at trade in time. "

I am 6 foot 6 inches tall and fit very well in it. What really sold me was how little fuel it took. I now own a 2008 and average 33-35 mpg in town and 36 to 39 mpg on the highway. By the way it is a 5-speed, which is a hoot to drive, especially around town. Thanks for a great little car Pontiac! "

My wife and I were banged up and bruised but able to walk away. We found out it had 4 and 5 stars in crash tests.

pontiac,vibe,2009,pearlsport03, 08/16/2010,Delivers On Target For Its Design!,5,"Ok, I bought this as a lease return with 15k.  But it's GM Certified.  Now, review for what it is, not for what is not.  It delivers on every aspect of its designed mission.  It's an AWD AT SUV/5 door lift back, with comfortable seating for 4 (5 if you have kids).  Great space to load stuff with seats down.  Peppy, quiet, nice handling, not too stiff or spongy, and fuel economy is pretty darn good for an AWD.  It's easy to get between 25 and 30 mpg normal driving.  Sound system/CD/MP3/XM is very nice, and On Star is a plus.  Mostly Toyota Matrix twin, so I know it's gonna be durable and last (parts will always be around). AWD w/AT will use more gas than 2WD, but that's expected. 2 Thumbs Up!"

I fell in love with this car and could not be more happy with my purchase. The Vibe is well built for a car of it's class. I feel confidant that I will be driving my Vibe for many years.
Mine had 36k on it when I bought her. I was able to buy a GMAC warranty for a whopping $1100. due to the low miles. 
I have my oil changes done at the dealership due to the type of oil the Vibe requires. 
I have my dogs kennel tethered to the child seat restraint hooks in the back seat."
pontiac,vibe,2009,blargal, 02/24/2011,Great car for great price!,4,"I was on the search for a car for two weeks and almost bought a Mazda3 so glad I didn't!
This little car is very well made and i've always loved pontiacs as my first car was one and never had an issue with it till it got in an accident.
I thought i couldn't afford this car when I first test drove it but I got it right in my price range per month had great credit and apr and I knocked them down to 13grand :) basicly for the price you just can't beat the deal on a reliable car like this.
Oh I chose the GT model cause thats what I have...but its an auto but has the option to switch to manual sooo 5 speed manual? only option they had lol."

pontiac,vibe,2009,Greg, 07/01/2018,MyVibeGT,5,"Just about the best car I have ever owned! Best things: Super reliable, Toyota sibling but with Pontiac styling. At 170,000 still going strong. Peppy acceleration, great handling, awesome sound system, 30+MPG Hwy. Worst things: Ride is stiff, seats somewhat uncomfortable for long trips. Engine vibration, I think I need new motor mounts. Wish they still made them, I'd but another one today!

pontiac,vibe,2009,ingrid, 10/14/2015,Great small white utility car 1.8 Automatic,5,"I got mine when the model was new in late 2008 , and over the years  the car  had a bunch of recalls on both the GM and Toyota component but no problem getting them done by the dealership.The biggest recall was on the CV boots.

At 82,000 miles I am on my second set of tires, brakes .Some small chip paint on the hood , no discoloration on headlamps.Inside ,the volume knob is only part that is loose . I do notice the accelaration from 0-65 is not as fast as it use to be but once you are there it accelrates to 75-85 pretty fast . I am fast safe driver on the freeway. Some rattling here and there but nothing unusual.
I augmented the visual side mirrors since I had a few close call of the blind spots. 
When the back seat are folded it creat a hugh loading space where we can feet 5-6  feet long objects from Ikea , a projector screen. So my car has become the utility car . 
Always love the high sitting position, with my bad back and hip ,it really helps a lot .Too bad they stopped making this model, they should have converted  this into a hybrid .  I think this is one of the better designed compact utility hatchback body car out there, escpecially with the high rating crash test.

I love my Vibe, bought it with 50k on it and have put 50k on it in the last 2 years. Its comfortable enough for the average commuter and very reliable. Great for hauling stuff around, and although no sports car its fun to drive. Good fuel economy, easily get 31-32 mpg. Only a few gripes, rear visibility is so-so, paint chips/scratches easy, speakers could be better. "
pontiac,vibe,2009,blazer7t8, 07/18/2013,Great Versatile Car!,4,"We bought our 09 Vibe AWD when it was a year old and had 11K miles. It has 90K, now. My wife drives it most of the time and she liked the size and control layout. The interior is nice and the seats are comfortable. We often take this car on a 4 hour road trip to visit family and my back does not hurt. We average 28 mpg. Have gotten as high as 32. It swallows up cargo. Have hauled tall filing cabinets, 8Kw generators, lumber, etc. With the higher ground clearance and AWD it gets around great in Ohio winter snow.
It could use more sound insulation. You hear a lot of road noise. New tires at 58K helped but still noisy. No major repairs, only normal maintenance items. Overall, great car!"
pontiac,vibe,2009,LostPsyche, 11/19/2010,Fantastic Little Hatchback,4,"I have only had this car a month and I love this thing. It is really fun to drive and seems to be really solid on the road even in the turns. It is no Mazda 3 but for me it is sporty enough with a lot of practical applications. I really wish GM had not killed this car off, they could have re-badged it to a Chevy or Buick nameplate which is a shame that they just let it drop instead. The cruise control takes a bit to get used to. The Engine is nice too, a little torquey on take offs but it is a solid engine and great for quick merges. "

"
pontiac,vibe,2009,Daniel C, 07/11/2018,This car does everything well (almost),4,"This car is a real looker. It's what the Kia Soul should have looked like, if the Soul were a hatchback as in a normal, not boxy car. The engine is great, starter is quiet for an economy car. This model was equipped with GM's auto-crank technology (flick the key to start and release, the starter will keep cranking until the engine catches.) It's the Toyota 1.8 from the Corolla and it's excellent in this car. Great match to the automatic 4 speed transmission. Easier to get into and out of than lower slung cars. XM radio and stability control are nice touches, although I've tried to provoke the VSC and it seems to kick in a little late (this could be due to Pontiac's marketing of a ""sporting"" demeanor.) They put an actual 115 volt household outlet in the car too, although there is a cutoff point to how many watts the plugged in object can be. The outlet will shut down if the limit is exceeded. A good driving position for tall people still leaves your feet a little closer to the pedals than you'll really be comfortable with, but, minor issue. Handling is stable but not sport worthy.  The ride can best be described as firm but not punishing, well controlled. Climate controls are Toyota and very easy to figure out. Lots of cupholders and storage space. There's even (flimsy) cup holders in the back and storage space under the trunk floor (it's not much space though).  Cargo space is good and expandable to one back seat down, both and even the front passenger seat folds if needed. Overall a great driving car for what it is. 4 speed automatic transmission shifts VERY smoothly. if it doesn't something's wrong. Keep up on the maintenance and repairs and this car will run forever.

I am 6'4"", and I loved the headroom/interior space in this vehicle. I am a single father and was looking for value, reliability and gas efficiency. After a couple of tanks of gas driving in the city, I realized I was getting 7L/100km. Awesome! I am over 40K now and have only had it into the shop for 2 recalls. It has never let me down. It is not super powerfull on the highway. (slow going up a hill with the kids in the back) But I will trade that for the gas mileage I get any day. On-star in-car phone was interesting for the first year, but I let it expire because I didn't want to pay the fees."

Once seated in drivers seat, I was hooked. There is a lot of room in this car. I was impressed. The car has a lot of zippiness and it fun to drive. Purchasing gas is also sweet.  I can go 7 days on a tank of gas (back and forth to work (60 miles a day) and tooling around town).  Very impressed with that aspect. Stereo has nice sound. I like the storage system in the back of the car for shopping. Backseat is roomy for a 6' person to sit comfortably.  All in all I'm very happy we purchased this vehicle when we did.  "

It gets around like a boss in the winter with AWD & winter tires, I never worry about getting stuck. It fits much more than you would think, with the hard plastic fold down seats. The MPG for me is about 25 city 30 highway. I bought this car november '13 with 45,000 miles on it, today it has 230,000 miles. Only thing that broke by itself with the car was the transmission(mechanic put in a used one from a pontiac vibe with only 21k miles on it SCORE). Things I fixed because I broke it or it was a weird thing that was not the car makes fault: Evaporator(rock got in it and I lost defrost) 4 new wheels (flimsy steel core chrome plated rims bent when I curbed the car, couldn't unbend) everything else has been regular maintenance. I am having a problem with my coolant turning red(rust) right now but it's been a hot summer so I'd say my water pump or thermostat is on the fritz but even those are expected repairs with most any car eventually. Overall I don't have a single complaint with this car it has been so perfect and reliable for me

My only complaint is that it's not the quietest ride,  but not terrible either.  I wish they were still in production, I would buy another.  The Matrix's outside isn't as appealing,  otherwise I would have considered one of those.  With tree GT trim, you get a whole lot of power in a compact package.

 On my second set of tires and brakes.
My steering column rattles (very common), cold starts sometime produce a timing cam rattle (common) and the paint chips and scratches easily (common).

Fully loaded with family of 4 + gear on trip to Tenn. got me just shy of 32mpg.
Even with my heavy foot, I still avg. 28mpg in daily mixed driving.

Great fun to drive. Does everything I need.
Was cheap to buy and maintain.

I have truly enjoyed it.

I just added a K&N CAI and she sounds great, any mpg increase will be a bonus."
pontiac,vibe,2009,RoundhouseMan, 08/29/2010,Great little car,4,"I have had two years of fun and economical driving.  It has lots of space for carrying people and cargo. The cargo area is high enough that I was even able to get a boxed dishwasher in the back with the seats folded and the lift gate closed, yet it still feels like a compact vehicle.  Manual driver's seat adjustment up and down is possible (not just sliding the seat back and forth), a plus for short people.  Mileage is 30-33 on the freeway.

GM was giving these Vibes away and all I needed was a basic car with decent space, room for 5, and AWD for trips to Lake Tahoe in the winter.  Since I bought the Vibe, I've put 3800 miles on it, and only 500 on my Porsche.  I love this Vibe.  It doesn't handle particularly well, it isn't that fast, it doesn't have any luxuries, and it isn't beautiful.  But, I find myself drawn to its fun, comfortable, and easy to drive nature.  My friends and family make fun of me for showing up in my Vibe while my Porsche sits in the garage, but I can't help from loving this stupid Vibe."

Free Garmin GPS.  Sold '03 33m miles for 9,500.  Only issue so far is a few rattles.  Less engine/road noise than the '03 and many extra safety features - 4 whl disc ABS, Stab Ctrl, 6 airbags.  Just enough bigger than the FIT to be practical with nearly same mpg.  Getting used to electric power steering but that is the current trend.  Drive by wire seems no different.  Just as comfortable, no harder to see out of than the '03 - got to use your mirrors. Hope to keep this Matrix twin 10+ yrs"

For $21,000 you get so much for your money plus the advantage of great gas mileage. It's really quick with the 2.4 L GT engine and the 18"" wheels ride smooth. The interior is so sexy with all the leather accents and styling. The exterior is eye popping and catchy. Its a very stylish ride and we love it so much. Also the XM Radio and OnStar is a plus!!!"

Love the ride! It is easy to get in and out of, sits high, and it really hugs the road. It has a zippy start and wants to go much faster than the speed limit permits, so when possible, I use the cruise control which runs very evenly (no fits and starts). So far I get 25-26 mpg in city driving. Stereo is great and the sunroof is nice for California. Storage capacity is excellent, and the rubberized surface makes cleanup easy. Price was $300 over invoice."

I find it makes my knee sore after driving a couple hours. I have to constantly adjust my left leg. Maybe it is the angle the dead pedal puts your foot and leg in. Not sure but I do know it gives my left knee discomfort. I am working on creating a solution. Other that that the seating is very comfortable and room is very good.

pontiac,vibe,2009,RHenningsen, 04/28/2009,Review by RMH,4,"This the third Vibe we've owned and each one has had exceptional gas mileage. The last Vibe got 30.1 miles per gallon for 29000 miles.  This 2009 is averaging over 30 miles per gallon too. Repairs have only required service oil,filter,tire rotation and alignment on the 2006 model. The 2009 has only 3000 miles and has had no repairs as of yet.  On the 2009 model I miss the carpeting on the deck in back the shade covering that area along with the intermittent window washer. Other wise the 33.2 miles per gallon on a recent trip is great. I hate to see the Pontiac line disappear. Maybe they will give the vehicle to Chevrolet for a boost in their division car mileage requirements. "
pontiac,vibe,2009,Klawdad, 05/05/2009,Still Thining!,4,"I traded in a Toyota truck just because of payments, but I love Toyota. When I read that the Vibe was essentially a Toyota, I went to the dealer because everything I read was good. I have never had a small car, so I was hesitant, but this car is actually fun to drive and the MPG is awesome--right now I'm getting 28-30 in combo driving. Yes the wheel caps fall off and yes the ride is bumpy, but I am not sorry I traded--except when I needed a half ton of mulch last week."

Comfortable, spacious, nice tall driving stance, solid feeling, good 4 wheels disk brakes, fun-easy to drive. Electric steering wheel is somewhat different but ideal for every day operation. All of the important features (especially safety) are there.  Well thought out interior (including 120V outlet) and exterior (plastic molding are in the right places and may better resist winter salt). The engine is not too responsive when driven softly but wakes up when RPM >2000. BTW this Toyota engine is used by the Lotus Exige sport car. A fifth  gear would be nice on the highway. My wife loves it. I take very opportunity to drive it."
pontiac,vibe,2009,Cgts, 05/12/2009,Always loved this car!,4,"All I can say is that anything would have suited me fine after having driven a Daewoo Lanos! But, I always admired the Pontiac Vibe for its adorable design since the first time I ever saw it. These new defined designs of the car is just stunning! I've got the GT, and I love how this car looks! As an art major, it has been just spectacular having so much cargo space to haul my sculptures and oversized paintings. Very reliable car, not to mention it is crazy fun to drive. One thing I thought was great about the car was the magnificent interior design, but this is coming from someone who used to have cup holders directly under the radio, so I guess there's room for improvement on that note."
pontiac,vibe,2009,Ron, 06/03/2009,My Second Vibe,5,"This is my second Vibe---my first is an '03 with 103K miles which my teenage son will inherit. The '03 has been flawlessly reliable! I purchased the '09 last week at an incredible deal--$4300 off in GM/Driver's Edge card rebates, $3000 in additional rebates for paying cash, and at a price that was well below invoice!! I was a little concerned that Pontiac parts might not be available in the long haul but GM insures me that Vibe owners will be supported for years to come. Since the power train is Toyota I am not concerned. If you are shopping for a reliable vehicle that gets great mpg--Vibe is the way to go."
pontiac,vibe,2009,Hez, 06/10/2009,I LOVE my Vibe,5,"The Vibe, by far, is the roomiest and best-riding car in its class and it is very fun to drive.  Having previously driven a Suburban, surprisingly, I do NOT feel like my bottom is dragging on the ground.  This car was purchased primarily for driving around town with kids in tow.  There is plenty of room in the back for them being in car seats.  My dog even enjoys riding in the ""trunk""! For those of you who think the Vibe is comparable to the Dodge Caliber, you're thinking WRONG!  I drove the Caliber and the Vibe in the same day and there is NO comparison.  The fuel economy is also great. I just filled up my tank in the Vibe and calculated 26 mpg city driving in 3rd gear! (see improvements)"

That erases my earlier comment on the need for a ""4(forward)speed transmission"" as the 1.8L Vibe has one. ...not sure I understand the comment about the noisy ride as mine drives quietly---certainly less noise than in the '03 version.

Very smooth and quiet, by comparison with good power. Fuel mileage has been outstanding.  With the rebates and credit card points available it was a deal we couldn't pass up, even though we weren't in the market for a new car. However, my wife has already informed me that she will be getting a speeding ticket as this Vibe is much quicker and smoother than her old one.  We're extremely pleased, again.  Can't believe GM won't be offering this vehicle any more.  Major mistake! Please reconsider, GM."

pontiac,vibe,2009,Sam H, 10/10/2009,Practicle,4,"This car does a little bit of every thing.  I can haul a trailer, put the seats down, seat 4 adults 6 ft or taller and get good mileage.  This car does it all.  Pluses include room, ceiling height, get up and go, mileage and style.  The biggest negative is road noise, just turn up the XM radio. 17,000 miles after a year and 2 months of ownership, just change the oil and rotate tires.  MPG is 28-30 with mixed driving with quiet engine.  The seats are comfortable and fit taller people well I'am 6.1 and can wear a hat. "
pontiac,vibe,2009,massbio, 12/21/2009,an offer I couldn't refuse,4,"We have an automatic 1.8L. Good basic transportation and safety features.  An upgrade to ABS and traction control for us.  Engine is peppy.  Lots of things could be better:  paint chips easily.  Spoiler chips paint on hatch (check out those you see in parking lots).  Big blind spot!  Wind noise from somewhere.  Tire pressure warning is incorrect.  Interior could be roomier without making the car bigger.  Design was superior in 2008.  Still, we expect it will last a long time for us."
pontiac,vibe,2009,Tundra88, 02/02/2010,Basic Transport with attitude!,4,"My family needed to replace a very unreliable Volvo and decided to go with this Vibe. Toyota build at a GM price. Of course since the purchase we've had to deal with the gas pedal recall but otherwise it's been flawless. During the recent Atlanta ice storm we parked my 4WD pickup and drove the Vibe. It was great in the icy conditions. Stability control is awesome! Good gas mileage, decent handling and (subjective) good looking. Everyone in the family loves driving the Vibe, it's no race car, but then it's not supposed to be...  "
pontiac,vibe,2009,papi, 01/31/2010,safe reliable commuter car,4,"Son drives to school 25 miles. Mileage is great on highway. Not a lot of bells and whistles but is a safe and reliable car. XM is nice, and on star is great for college kids and parents peace of mind.  Car can store a lot. I wish that they did not get rid of the separate opening glass on the rear door this year, but all in all it is a great first car, well above the typical entry level vehicle."
pontiac,vibe,2009,kc hillman, 02/11/2010,Nice Car - of Course GM Quit Making Them,5,"This bought used 2009 GT would be our second Vibe, also have a 2004 we bought new. The 2009 has the 2.4 engine which makes a lot of power for a car this size. The 5 speed automatic shifts flawlessly. The northeast U.S. has been getting bombarded with massive snow lately, but the Vibe hasn't let us down once! The 18 inch rims are quite sharp looking, the fit and finish appear to be up to par too. All in all a fine little vehicle!"
pontiac,vibe,2009,Opnun, 05/30/2010,Great Value,5,"This car has been a great buy! Purchased new.  After one year of ownership, absolutely no problems (especially related to the accelerator recall). Have performed all regular maintenance, taken several long trips (1000+ miles) and the car has performed flawlessly. I am 6'2"" and have plenty of room and don't feel beat up after a long trip. Love the extras that I couldn't find on a comparative Honda Fit, including  Onstar, XM radio, traction control, AC Power plug, and spacious interior for a compact wagon. 2.4 liter engine is great for quick acceleration. Have gotten up to 35 mpg on highway at 70 mph.  Deals were so good at the  time, I wish I had bought two!"
pontiac,vibe,2009,Debbie, 07/08/2010,Love the Vibe,4,"I just bought this car and love it! It is fun to drive, great radio, and I love the room in the back with the fold down seats. I am able to fit my two dogs back their easily. I look forward to many years driving this car."
pontiac,vibe,2009,John Doey, 06/03/2017,Love my vibe....But!,4,"I have the 2009 base model 1.8 liter engine with automatic transmission. Great little car...good on gas very few repairs plus one set of new tires. 2 complaints, one it drives awful in snow, 1 inch or more...Tried 3 sets of different brands of dedicated snow tires and found that The Dunlap  winter sport 3D's worked the best on this car.... in any snow, can't drive with all-season tires tried it twice not good ! Second problem is it is hard to see out the back side window if any cars are coming your way when backing out of a parking space.

pontiac,vibe,2009,26.2, 04/26/2009,Happy,5,"My 1st American-made car purchase in 30 years. That, plus GM's pending doom made me hesitant about purchasing an '09 Vibe but glad we did. Traded the AWD of a Forester for the mpg of a Vibe. Very happy after the first month. The 1.8l with std transmission is a little slow off the line but has plenty of windup once you pass 3000 rpm. Nice quite ride. 35+ mpg highway. 28 mpg in town.  Yakima canoe rack fits the roof fine. "

No major issues or squeaks and rattles have arisen yet.  Have only changed the oil/filter and added fuel injector cleaner so far.  Was getting a fairly consistent 30 mpg of mostly highway driving with a fully loaded car, bike hitch rack, and a codriver who doesn't know how to smoothly modulate a gas pedal. Vibe has decent midrange punch with the 2.4 to pass and get up the hills. Glad I opted for the bigger engine  Overall pretty happy with my purchase as the car has been both reliable and practical. For the money this car is hard to beat"
pontiac,vibe,2009,chlywily, 11/13/2010,Pretty good for the money,3,"The car has been very reliable, but has an intermittent knocking when started sometimes.  Can be hot or cold and the dealer has no clue."

pontiac,vibe,2009,vksandsek, 05/30/2008,What a car,5,"I bought the 2009 Vibe with 1.8 liter engine and 4-speed automatic transmission. The power is sufficient and the gas mileage is excellent. The engine does not feel strained and remains quiet even at speeds above 80 mph. On the exterior, the Vibe is somewhat better looking than its sister, the Toyota Matrix. The interior is ergonomic, comfortable and well designed. "
pontiac,vibe,2009,Frank Dolen, 06/07/2008,2009 Vibe Versatile and Practical,4,Purchased car end of May and have driven about 260 miles. Good mileage about 28 mpg with 50% city and 50% highway. Should improve with break in. 5 speed automatic shifts smoothly and 2.4 engine has plenty of pep. Comfortable and smooth ride.Would recommend. Vibe seemed to run smoother than its twin the Toyota Matrix and was priced better.
pontiac,vibe,2009,2009 Base, 06/13/2008,Vibe,5,"I traded in my beloved Jeep Wrangler for the Vibe.  Aside from the fact that I can no longer take the top down on a nice day I really like this car.  I am a big guy and I do not feel the least bit cramped, nor is there an issue of getting in and out of the car.  It is fun to drive and really very quite.  If you get one, pay for the power package.  I did not do this and now wish I would have.  "
pontiac,vibe,2009,Joed, 06/13/2008,09 Vibe 5m,4," I'm delighted with the car.  Smooth ride. Easy, light operation of clutch and shifter.  Geared so I can get into 5th at 40 or 45, which is economical for my city driving but may explain why EPA highway is only 32.  IP attractive and easy to read but I wish speedometer numbers were by 10s not 20s.  Pleased to find the 1.8 engine quite adequate."
pontiac,vibe,2009,Ernie, 06/17/2008,"Great ""big"" little car.",5,"This car feels bigger than it is.  The ride is exceptional for something so small and while we are not huge people, there is room enough for even a large person.  The back seat is very comfortable for two.  Three might be pushing it.  Fun to drive and handles nicely on our twisty turny up and down roads we encounter daily.  Gas mileage, 27 to 33, has been above expectations and will only improve as it breaks in.  I would recommend this car to even good friends."
pontiac,vibe,2009,kasjun, 06/28/2008,2009 pontiac vibe,3,We like our new vibe because of it's ease of getting around in traffic and parking. We like the mileage we are getting but feel it could do better with a 5-speed trans. But Pontiac chose not to offer it on awd model. We bought chrome wheels which turned out to be just plastic wrapped chrome that chips and peels. Pontiac does not stand behind these. The awd model gets a roof rack that is worthless. There is no option for leather or heated seats so we had these installed after market. Radio options are limited and no navigation system option. Pontiac needs to get off their rear and go to work with these option pkgs. Or people will just look elsewhere. I called Pontiac with chrome wheel problem an
pontiac,vibe,2009,joep, 06/28/2008,More fun than I hoped,5,"This is actually the 5 sp Auto. Just turned 3000 miles and I still love to get in this car and drive. With fairly aggressive driving, I consistently get 25 mpg combined urban/freeway driving and over 29 on the freeway. Very comfortable with a great sound system. You can take circular freeway on-ramps at high rate of speed and it stays firmly planted in your lane and with very little body roll. The ""torquey"" engine is always ready to scoot when you want to. My two previous cars were a Mustang SVO and a Taurus SHO and I really don't miss them. "
pontiac,vibe,2009,Crone_Art, 07/06/2008,carol,5,I have driven it 6500 miles in six weeks. Absolutely no complaints of any kind. Mileage is fabulous.The last 820 miles was 31.8 mpg at average 73 mph. For the entire 6500 miles average is 30 mpg. Space for storage is great.
pontiac,vibe,2009,Nate, 07/09/2008,Vibe Baby Vibe!,5,"This car has mojo  It has both fit and function.  Best of all, I'm getting no less than 29 mpg highway with a full load and AC running out of a 2.4 L 5 speed automatic.   I give it a 10 for the price."
pontiac,vibe,2009,Indybill41, 07/10/2008,Sporty wagon,4,I have enjoyed driving it comfortable highway cruiser.We took it on a long trip to Virginia and got 31mpg on average.I was really impressed with the mileage I had a 2003 vibe 1.8 auto. that only got 28.5 on the exact same trip. It handled the mountains with ease the 03 vibe struggled in the mountains. I didn't get as tired in this car on this trip versus all others I have owned. I have had 80 vehicles since 1979. Traded a 07 Pontiac solstice GXP in on this car no regrets. Glad I made the purchase.
pontiac,vibe,2009,ray the german, 07/09/2008,Love that engine!,4,"My previous vehicle was a 2005 Pontiac Vibe and did not have any problems with it whatsoever, however due to the new safety features, new look, and the excellent 2.4 L engine, I traded it in for a new 2009 Vibe GT. Drove the vehicle to and from North Carolina two days after purchasing it and averaged 30 miles to the gallon. I love the pep of the engine and it's just a fun car to drive!"
pontiac,vibe,2009,jackb, 07/12/2008,Fun to Drive and Practical,4,"Bought only used 2009 Vibe GT I could find within 300 miles of Chgo. Got a good deal $18,800 less trade etc. Had 3400 miles on it. Have had it for a month now. One long trip to Nashville, 1000 Mi. Fun to drive, handles great, performance w/5 sp auto very good. Very useful cargo capacity. Interior nice upscale, except it could use a little more foot & leg room. Exterior styling more appealing than previous model Vibes. Looks good in Hot Red Metallic. Gas mileage could be better about 23-25 in city, on trip avgd. 27.5 mpg driving 75-85mph plus some city driving, AC on whole trip. Trade off for 2.4 perf., I guess. Wife's car mostly. Quality seems very good & so far very reliable."
pontiac,vibe,2009,PontiVibe, 10/01/2008,Not just a city car,4,"Purchased my Vibe one day and set out on a 2000 km journey the next and was very impressed with the ride and handling.  Completing mostly highway driving the 2.4 L engine has lot of power and is able to cruise along comfortably at above average highway speeds.  For a small car the gas mileage is not overly great and is better compared to a small SUV than a car of equal size.  However, if the Vibe is going to be used for highway driving the bigger engine provides lot of power for passing and merging into traffic.  One real benefit of this vehicle is that it is able to handle unpaved roads very well and the traction control is an added asset when coming upon loose gravel.  "
pontiac,vibe,2009,Steve Hale, 11/15/2008,Bye Bye SUV,4,After looking for a replacement for my wife's SUV. I chose the 2009 AWD Vibe over the Subaru Impreza. The sunroof was not available in the Subaru which we desired. We also liked the plastic flat floor when the seats were down. Since the drive train is Toyota in the Vibe we new reliability should not be an issue. Add the XM radio and OnStar into the mix and the value seemed to be much better. So far my wife loves the car. We can't wait to see how the AWD does this winter.
pontiac,vibe,2009,Lou Welke, 12/31/2008,Driving the Pontiac Vibe,5,This Pontiac Vibe is one of many Pontiacs that I have owned. Having AWD on this car is awesome I was driving on packed snow and ice and it just kept on going and driving through deep snow didn't stop it and I passed vehicles on my street that had fwd and were stuck. The acceleration is very good and the gas mileage is acceptable. This is a great car and my wife loves it. We just drove from Grand Rapids Mich. to Pensacola Fl with a lot of baggage and it had lots of room for all of it.  
pontiac,vibe,2009,bought2nd, 01/15/2009,Have twins!,4,"Bought a 1.8 liter in March for my wife. I liked it so much that when I found a used one on the internet, I went and bought it.  Did not realize it was a 2.4 liter.  Has more power that the 1.8, but fuel economy is still good (approx 27) city driving."
pontiac,vibe,2009,sassysparky, 01/20/2009,I like it,5,"We just purchased the 1.8L Vibe (09) this past weekend, with some upgrades like AC, cruise control, and power doors and locks.  It's been handling extremely well in the Michigan winter, and I'm already getting great gas mileage on my little jaunts around town. Love the way it looks, it feels solid yet zippy.  I wish the base model had some radio controls on the steering wheel, but the car comes with XM radio which is great where I live. So far, so good.  Having some issues figuring out the proper tire pressure though!"
pontiac,vibe,2009,Bill, 01/22/2009,A winner,4,"We purchased the Vibe after much research, to replace our 2000 Impala. The Vibe has great interior room. Functional and fun to drive. The 2.4 motor has enough pickup when merging into traffic.  It looks good too!"
pontiac,vibe,2009,phillip, 01/24/2009,A Vibe for a Vibe,4,"I bought a 2004 Vibe in 2004 and loved it from day one. The fuel economy and versatility was just what my family needed. Never had a minutes trouble with the car. I recently traded the 04 in for an 09.  Once again, I loved it from day one. This time I upgraded to the GT model and was not disappointed.  It handles great, drives smooth and quiet, and has a little more get up and go than the base model.  I highly recommend it to families who need a good, reliable car that gets good gas mileage and has lots of room."
pontiac,vibe,2009,John, 02/06/2009,Nice Car,4,"I bought this car to replace my 1999 SC1 Saturn.  I was looking at the Toyota Matrix but the Vibe is the same car and I got a better deal.  The ride is real smooth and is very easy to park in tight places.  The only real gripe is you can not turn off the headlights, even in park.  Most cars come with a off switch for the automatic lights but this car does not have the capability."
pontiac,vibe,2009,Repoman, 03/25/2009,Nice ride,5,"Overall build quality is great.  After 10000 hwy miles averaging 31 MPG (2.4L, 5 Auto). Ride is comfortable and quiet.  Performance and handling are good. Very quick and responsive.  "
pontiac,vibe,2009,Emmaleigh, 03/26/2009,Great Car!,5,"I bought my vibe in January and it does a great job in the snow of Michigan. It is fun to drive, and has tons of space. It is also extremely comfortable and great for long drives."
pontiac,vibe,2009,Nancy, 06/14/2009,"1 yr, 26000 miles - Nice Car",5,"I waited for the AWD to return in 2009, and am happy I did. Nice, tight steering, it has more pickup than my 6 cyl Stratus, & the AWD plows through snow like a champ. Lots of cargo space  and super-versatile layout. I can fit almost anything that would have fit in my Blazer. CONS: I wish the Vibe offered more options. In this day and age, its crazy that you cant get power seats even if you want them!  Like others, I noticed the chippy paint, but thought it was due to living on a rocky dirt road. Also, everyone is raving about the milage- its ok, but I think a car of this size could do better. Overall, I LOVE it! This is a great car for the money and I would happily buy another."
pontiac,vibe,2009,Brian G., 07/05/2009,A Versatile Fun Car,5,"   I've only had this car for 2 weeks. It's so much fun to drive, and handles like a much more expensive vehicle. The ride is quiet and smooth, and the 2.4 engine provides more than enough power. The interior seems spacious and all the controls are in easy access. The interior uses alot of plastic, however it does not look or appear cheap. The seats are very comfortable in the front and rear, and the cargo space is incredible when the rear seats are folded down. The A/C blows nice and cold which is a plus, since I live in Florida. I wanted the upgraded radio, but mine has the base radio, however it sounds great. I've driven in some very heavy rain, and this car was terrific! GREAT CAR!!!"
pontiac,vibe,2009,jmklein, 07/22/2009,2009 Pontiac Vibe,5,"I have just purchased a new 2009 Vibe with optional auto/manual shift package, 17 chrome rims/rear spoiler, and other little misc. options as well.  The car is definitely worth its weight in gold, I traded in my 2003 Grand Am, and am very impressed that Pontiac has stuck with the great responsive, sport like steering.  The car overall has great body lines, interior is comfortable, and the fold down rear seats including the passenger are a great feature.  The overall pick-up response of the car is very impressive, especially in manual mode where you can get the few extra RPM's when wanting to get that ""race feel.""  Overall, you can feel the great quality everytime you get behind the wheel.  "
pontiac,vibe,2009,Cbrown, 02/28/2010,Great little car,4,"I'm very pleased with my Vibe. It's the AWD model. It handles well and is pretty zippy with the 2.4L engine. Upgraded factory sound system with Sirius/XM is great. Mileage has consistently been around 26-27 mpg. The car is great in the snow with or without snow tires. With the back seat down it has an amazing amount of cargo space. The back seat has a lot of leg room for a small car. Too bad they discontinued this car, I'd buy another one!"
pontiac,vibe,2009,WTH, 03/20/2010,Post recall thoughts,4,Much better than the previous model. Much more comfortable. Much peppier. No problems merging on to hi-ways and fun on back roads. Great in rain and snow. If you have a strong ego it's more car than you'd   ever need. 
pontiac,vibe,2009,careckner, 05/22/2010,Best Hatch on the Market,4,"This is an amazing little car, its 2.4 L. engine is snappy enough to get to 60 in about 10 sec (shifting manually), plenty of room for 2 adults and 2 kids in car seats, cargo area is amazing, seats are very comfortable(and I'm 6'8"") Seating position is very good,Gauges are bright, clear and well laid out, stereo is very good for stock.   While shopping for this car, I tried a Nissan Versa, Hyundai Accent, Suzuki SX4, and a Dodge Caliber R/T, in the end it came down to this and the Caliber. Unfortunately GM doesn't have their act together, because this was by far the best economy car in their line up, fortunately its made by Toyota (Matrix Clone) so you get Toyota quality with Pontiac style."
pontiac,vibe,2009,Leslie Davies, 03/19/2008,I still miss my 2005 Vibe!,4,"This is the 4th AWD drive Vibe I have owned.  I had to purchase it sight unseen since my '05 lease was ending.  I was delighted to hear that Pontiac was bring the AWD back, since it is such a fun, easy, efficient car to do errands around town.  I only have 200 miles on it so I suppose I need a little time to adjust. It is attractive outside and I love the bright red.  Inside, as a 5 foot tall women, I am still bothered by the lowering of the rear view mirror to accommodate the Onstar system, and the repositioning of the front right roof columns, along with the larger side mirrors.  These 3 things seem to change my sight lines-they are different than my others models. "
pontiac,vibe,2009,Tahoe Trader, 04/13/2008,Look at me I'm saving,4,"Just traded '07 Tahoe, thought the ride would be degraded but was happy to find this ""sub compact"" not small at all.  Roomy and so much fun to drive, can't believe a 4cyl could have so much pep! All my SUV neighbors can laugh but I'm laughing all the way to the bank.  Excellent vehicle of choice with the changes taking place in our economy."
pontiac,vibe,2009,john, 04/29/2008,"Pretty good, improved awd",3,"I had a 2005 vibe awd that was horrible in the snow etc.  It was like it didnt even have awd so I traded it in quickly.  I test drove the 2009 Vibe awd and it was much much much better in snow.  Pricing is good but gm needs to put some incentive on it, even Toyota is offering 0 percent on the Matrix.  So I am waiting a bit to purchase unless the Subaru Forester comes out with some good incentive (great car too) first.  Subis do have the best awd.  I like the new vibe the 2.4 engine is a big big improvement over the 1.8 quiter, peppier smoother.  I do think they should offer the 5 speed auto Rather than the 4 speed with the awd.  Mileage would be better, get up to date gm and Toyota.  "
pontiac,vibe,2009,Carrie, 05/08/2008,Excellent,5,I was researching a 2005-2007 Vibe and one could not be found that did not have extremely high miles. That should have told me something. I purchased my Vibe on 05/03/08 and absolutely love it.  It is very fun to drive and handles great.  
pontiac,vibe,2009,IMSL, 05/21/2008,I love this car,4,"I had an 05 Vibe that I loved, but had to trade-in after accident.   The 09 Vibe has everything I loved about my 05 Vibe, and more!  The Stereo is excellent, the handling and power is awesome; too awesome, I got a speeding ticket before I hit 1000 miles on the car.  I like the standard roof rack; the new cup holders are perfect, and I like the fact that the cargo area has anti-slide strips.  Also a nice addition is the recessed cargo hooks.  It's a fantastic car for the price!"
pontiac,vibe,2009,J.B. Morris, 05/23/2017,Great value,4,"I purchased an 8 year old 2009 Vibe GT with 78k miles. Overall it's a very nice economy hatchback. It has a total of 8 cup holders (half designed for water bottles), seats fold flat including front passenger. In terms of seating position, fuel economy, ride stiffness  it's somewhere between a standard hatchback and mid sized SUV.  Main complaint are interior rattles and overall cabin noise at highway driving speeds. I've gotten 25 to 31 on every fuel up. GT trim has the larger 2.4L Camry engine and gives this car very good zip, if it does give up some mpgs.

On a flip side, computer keeps failing and my dashboard looks like a Christmas tree with lights on.  Every time they reset the computer I have to pay labor.  I see no Pontiac or Toyota in my future.  Subaru?

pontiac,vibe,2009,RobRWA123, 09/21/2008,Vibe Runs Great & Great Deal!,4,"We've had this car for about 10 days now, and love driving it. Had to search hard for the 1.8 L/5MT, but worth the waiting. For the Base model, you won't need the 2.4L engine, unless you're going to be towing something. Compared to our 03 Vibe w/AT (we gave to our daughter), this car is quieter (engine noise especially reduced, road noise only noticeable at highway speeds), has more power, is much more comfortable, much safer (more [6] airbags, 4-wheel anti-lock disc brakes and Stabilitrak), and more fun to drive. And gets better MPG (well over 400 miles on 1st tank, gets better after break-in period)! Highly recommended; the best deal out there for a ""compact"" car, doesn't feel like one."
pontiac,vibe,2009,spyglass, 09/21/2008,No Complaints,4,"I have the 1.8L with the automatic option. Some professional reviewers knock it because it isn't ""fun"" like a BMW or a Porsche. Well for the money the car is great. Build quality is A-1. Seating is comfortable and it can take 4 passengers a long way before any of them start to feel cramped. Bought it for our son who is 6'2"" and 215 lbs (football player). He loves it. Gets great mileage. We got in the neighborhood of 34-36 mpg on the highway with the cruise control set at 70 mph. The 4sp auto tranny shifts smooth and the 1.8 engine won't win any races, but it's ideal for a car this size. Would buy it again in a heartbeat."
pontiac,vibe,2009,Steve Harper, 01/27/2009,OK for the Price,3,"We test drove a number of other small sedans/hatchbacks before deciding to purchase a Vibe. The ride quality and offered features seemed to be a cut above the rest of the pack.  However, so far we are not too impressed with the build quality (center wheel caps fell off, sunroof leaks, rear view mirror vibrates, paint easily scratched; instrument panel rattles/squeaks in cold weather). Also, the gas mileage is only OK (averaging 24 mpg in mixed driving). Traction in the snow seems to be reasonably good."
pontiac,vibe,2009,R&L, 10/23/2008,C'mon! Interior coming apart after 3 months,2,"We purchased this vehicle four months ago. First rims had bubbles in them, then the lever to release seat came apart and now after 4 months the window console panel is popping up. Very cheaply made and what's the deal with the stupid storage racks! couldn't come up with something better?  I could go on and on about things that we found wrong with this Jewel from GM. Way to go boys! Won't get another purchase from me again!"
pontiac,vibe,2009,dangelo, 06/23/2008,Vibe 2009,2,"Bought a black 2009 Vibe, because the car I really wanted was not available in my area. The Vibe is a nice car, but GM still does not have a clue on how to build a small car with the things most Americans are looking for. "
pontiac,vibe,2009,Acrista, 04/04/2009,Not Impressed,4,"Traded in my '08 Pontiac G5 (had tons of probs) for '09 Vibe bc of the wonderful ratings I had read on the '08's...wish I would not have. Has been a dependable car but I haven't enjoyed having it since I bought it. Seems to be a step down from my car that I had previously. Road noise is terrible inside of car! Maybe I am just used to my super quite G5 (couldn't even hear it on while inside) but I have to continuously turn up radio as I increase speed so I can hear it. Odometer does not give me read out of how many mpg I am currently getting, how many miles I have until I am out of gas, or what % of oil life I have left. These 2 have been big adjustment for me! "
pontiac,vibe,2009,john, 03/19/2008,2009 Vibe,4,"as much fun as my 2006 civic but more practical. I have a 2.4 with 5 spd auto which wasn't a choice on the drop down menu on this website.  Just got back from a 5000 km road trip and got about 39 mpg (Canadian) I rated the reliability high but really don't have the mileage to prove that, although the warranty is by Canadian standards very generous. "
pontiac,vibe,2009,LESS THAN HAPPY, 05/29/2009,Less Than Happy,3,"I find it difficult to give this car much of a rating.  I take my dog with me most everywhere I go, so I decided on the Vibe based on its size and practicality.  I am very disappointed.  This is by far the noisiest vehicle I have every owned!  I find myself checking the windows to see if I left one of them open.  There seems to be no sound deadening insulation in this vehicle at all.  This makes long trips very tedious - and also makes listening to music impossible.  Also, the AWD model should be available with a manual transmission - the automatic doesn't allow you to coast freely - it's always holding you back causing you to play with the accelerator to hold a constant speed."
pontiac,vibe,2009,2009 Pontiac Vibe GT, 06/12/2008,2009 pontiac Vibe GT,5,"We have owned our black GT for 2 months and love it. We have put 3600 miles on it so far. We drove the base 1.8 auto and did not like it at all. First gear was very short and then when hit second it bogged the motor down. I felt as if I would have to floor it every where I went. Then drove a 2.4 manual and was impressed. Found that the base models seats were too soft and the head rest bothered my wife. Lastly I drove the GT and just loved it. Seats are extremely better and the handling is superior to base. It is a little more bumpier than base probably because of the tire size. I did not drive the AWD. If the AWD is not needed, for the extra bucks go for the GT. Average 30 MPG. 80% highway"
pontiac,vibe,2009,traded in 2005 vibe, 07/26/2008,"Just Bought it, check engine light on",3,"Well, we just drove it off the lot today, they had to do a dealer trade to get the exact car i wanted, Carbon Gray GT. It had 297 miles on it from the trip down from Akron, Oh. We have put about 50 miles on it and the check engine light is on, there was a knocking sound in the engine and the Vehicle Stabilitrack ""VST"" lights are on. And it's Saturday, so no maintenance until Monday!"
pontiac,vibe,2009,fact finder, 09/07/2008,best buy,5,"Vibe is Toyota Matrix twin but COST LESS,has XM radio,floor mats,stability control,and onstar at no charge [these cost extra on Toyota]also has 5 year 100,000 mile warranty, gas mileage is 2 to 4 mpg better than promised 25city/31 highway, motor and automatic transmission are extremely smooth,easy to load and unload with rear seats down, comfortable smooth ride"
pontiac,vibe,2009,Skychief, 09/09/2008,Good Vibes,4,Very nice little car.  Wonderful and fun to drive around town.  Handles well.  Doors close nicely.  Seems to have been built with quality with good attention to detail.  I'm a big guy and I fit in it just fine.  It's amazingly roomy inside.  
pontiac,vibe,2009,car-mine, 09/11/2008,Back for more,5,"My wife has a 2005 Vibe. Very reliable.  We use it to car-top two kayaks, and I can fit my bicycle in it, with the back seats folded.  It has gotten good mileage--close to 30 MPG.  When I decided to get a new car for myself, I checked out the restyled 2009 Vibe and was impressed.  It is much sportier looking, and the interior has been refined.  The seats are firmer and more supportive.  The vinyl on the dashboard and upper door panels is cloth-like in texture, and somewhat upscale.   Hard to find the 1.8 liter engine with automatic, but one came through my local dealer and I snapped it up-- didn't want mileage penalty for the 2.4.  The 1.8 is quite good and quieter than in the 2005."
pontiac,vibe,2009,RobRWA123, 09/22/2008,Great Car/Great Price,4,"We've had this car for about 2 weeks now and couldn't be happier. Replaced an 03 Vibe. Obviously, we liked its predecessor, but the 09 is safer, quieter, has slightly more power w/slightly improved fuel economy, and burns cleaner. Overall ride and handling are better as well. Although hard to find, get the 1.8 L engine w/the base model; you won't need the 2.4 L. If you can, go 1 step further & get the 5-Spd manual - better MPG, feel more power, and more fun to drive."
pontiac,vibe,2009,Scott, 09/25/2008,"Performance, Utility, Economy and Cool!",5,"Traded in my SUV for the more efficient Vibe (sounds like a trend, doesn't it? Luckily, I only ended upside down by about $900 on the deal).  I was never a big fan of the older vibe. It just looked like a grocery getter, bland, wagon-like and just something moms and old ladies would drive.  But the 2009 Vibe caught my eye, particularly the GT trim. It's sleek, sexy and with the economical yet punchy 2.4 L option, I was sold. This is the 5 speed automatic version (there's no option for this, hello Edmunds!).  Small but roomy, powerful but economic (29 MPG on average!), great interior (the seats are SO comfortable), and this car is hot! Getting a lot of stares! I would recommend this car!"
pontiac,vibe,2009,Lisa, 09/28/2008,Vibe does it all very well!,5,"I have the 1.8 L Base model.  It was inexpensive. I average better then 33 mpg with mixed city/hgwy driving.  It's also comfy and roomy.  People comment on its good looks.  Good stereo, AC, and cargo area.  It also pulls my 1200 lb boat package.  This vehicle suits all of my driving needs, and does it quite well.  I have been thrilled and very happy with it.  "
pontiac,vibe,2009,Brotzy, 10/03/2008,Nice Car,3,Have had for 3 months. Has been good car except for two(2) tires they had to replace. Would not balance. Also has problem with speedometer. Speedometer on GT is 7% off because of the tires. There is not fix at this time and they say that it is within acceptable variance.
pontiac,vibe,2009,Mraz77, 10/04/2008,Back to the Vibe,5,"I originally had a 2003 Vibe and got almost 5 good years out of it before trading it in for a G6.  When searching for a second car this summer I tried to avoid looking at another Vibe, wanting to try something new, but I couldn't help it and realized that the 2009 Vibe is definitely that something new I was looking for.  Once driving a GT I realized it had everything my 2003 lacked, especially power.  Driving a lot of highway miles the difference in the upgrade to the 2.4L auto 5-speed is quite noticeable.  I love the feel and comfort, along with the safety.  I am definitely glad I invested in a Vibe once again."
pontiac,vibe,2009,iag1, 10/05/2008,not too bad,4,"My first car was a Lexus , so i am basically downgrading my ride to a more economical car that is a hatchback with a GM brand but with better safety features. The ride is actually pretty smooth but i sure miss the powerful engine. The cabin is pretty quiet and roomy. It doesn't feel like a small car at all.But the rear view needs work.It has blind spots.it needs bigger side mirror like the Scion.  I had a bad experience after the sale was done, the dealer is not cooperative in canceling the extras I signed for."
pontiac,vibe,2009,Wisconsinite, 10/18/2008,"fun to drive, but I'm disappointed",3,"2.4 l automatic with sunroof and sound package. It's fun to drive, but I think the sunroof sucks up about 2 mpg. I have never gotten over 30 mpg in the 5,000 miles I've driven it. I drive about 80% highway and 20 small town (no traffic jams) and get 27-28 mpg with conservative driving. I'm disappointed b/c I hoped I'd get what others reported during the months before I purchased. The ride is really rough, too. If I knew I'd get this mpg, I'd probably have stuck with another Sebring with a cushy ride. Also, in order to get the roof rack, I had to pay for custom wheels, so the option was really about another $1,000. I will probably trade it in the spring for a different American vehicle."
pontiac,vibe,2009,mmsphoto, 10/29/2008,Pleased so far,4,"I purposefully chose the 1.8l for it's higher gas mileage and have been getting 31 mpg combined so far. I wish some of the upper models were avail with the smaller engine, 2.4 is overkill and eliminates the point of a small, efficient hauler. The main competition was the Astra and I'm sad that the Pontiac isn't nearly as peppy for the same engine size and that it doesn't shift anywhere as smoothly. That said I like the layout of the interior a lot, everything is where I expect (not something I could say for the astra) and the price was sure right. The cargo area is great but really needs a dome light. I love that it's ipod ready and the AC works like a charm.  It's a very comfy ride."
pontiac,vibe,2009,DC, 11/12/2008,2009 Pontiac Vibe,4,"Purchased this vehicle as part of a pull ahead deal on a 2007 Yukon. I plan on driving the car for 6 months and give it to my daughter for her birthday. I'm 6-2, 250lbs and have plenty of head and shoulder room. I'm looking forward to the gas mileage. The vehicle is quiet in the city but a little noisy on the highway. Well built and simple controls which I love. Great car if your in this price range. Don't expect much get up and go on the 1.8L.     "
pontiac,vibe,2009,BW, 12/08/2008,Fun Function,4,"My girlfriend got a promotion and now drives 140 kms each day in winter conditions. We were looking for something bigger and safer over her 99 Metro. Settled on the Vibe due to the standard Traction and Stability Control (which isn't standard on the Matrix twin). Functionality of the car is great with lots of space (moved four winter tires and lots of gear while moving). I find the 1.8L to be plenty of power and gives upper level fuel economy (about 41 MPG Canadian average). Interior isn't anything special but seats are quality and thats all you really need. Perfect car for combining economy, function and a little bit of driving fun."
pontiac,vibe,2009,MooCow1527, 12/12/2008,Uh-Mazing,5,"I had purchased a Dodge Caliber in January 07- over the course of my 2 year relationship with that vehicle it was terrible. I wanted something new, but a similar body style. I found the 09 Vibe and fell in love. Its an amazing car with lots of features for not a lot of money. I got the dark silver paint with black inside. Sunroof, power everything, monsoon stereo and chrome rims. My husband says its like a space-ship inside. This is a fabulous car and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a fun, spunky car!"
pontiac,vibe,2009,Lisa Riggs, 12/14/2008,My 2 month lemon,4,"I just purchased my 2009 Vibe on 9/29/08 with recommendations from many people. I loved the car up until 11/18/08 when the car wouldn't start. as of today 12/14/08 the car is in the shop for the 4th time not starting. I have a 4 yr old son and I'm afraid to go out of town with this car. I purchased a brand new car so I wouldn't have any of these problems. I'm hoping they can fix the car this time otherwise, this is a lemon.  I've heard so many good things about the Vibe and then this happens. I'm very disappointed and will be expecting a full refund if it doesn't get fixed this time. "
pontiac,vibe,2009,mshuell, 12/15/2008,2009 Pontiac Vibe,5,"Our 2009 Vibe now has 8000 miles. It has been perfect in every way.  For a small engine, it scoots right along. At 75 mph on the highway it's as smooth as glass. The car gets great gas mileage. 32 mpg in mixed driving and 35 mpg on the highway.  I definitely bought the right car."
pontiac,vibe,2009,scott, 12/24/2008,Love it,5,"I have put 21,000 miles on my car and consistently get around 30 MPG. 80 highway 20 city. I have read the reviews and all the people complaining about radio, seats and engine performance, and other stuff. Let me tell them and you, do not go cheap, get the GT loaded up. The only option I did not get is the automatic. I did not want it. This little car handles just fine in the snow too. Traction control is very helpful. I have had no trouble with it so far. (8 months) If you are thinking of buying one, do not hesitate. Just go buy one. "
pontiac,vibe,2009,Paul Crockett, 01/12/2009,Practical But Fun,4,"I bought my Pontiac Vibe GT, the first new car I've owned, in April of 2008. I cross-shopped it against a Honda Civic and a Mazda3 sedan. I found the Vibe to be more practical than the Mazda and nearly as fun to drive. It handles with confidence, and the 2.4L engine has ample power and a somewhat sporty sound. The appearance and build quality of the interior are nothing special, but the controls are well laid out and there are some useful features, such as the bag hook in the passenger footwell and the rear cargo organizer. Despite some quality control issues, I would recommend the Vibe to anyone looking for a small car that is highly practical, but also offers some driving enjoyment."
pontiac,vibe,2009,rls1976, 01/14/2009,Pleased as punch,4,"I was not in the market for a GM product, but had to go with GM, liked the looks of this car and am in love with it. Fun to drive on my hour and a half commute, and comfortable too. Sporty. My boyfriend is a gearhead and he even likes this car. Everyone who sees this car loves it. My passengers are comfy. I moved after purchasing the car, and it carried my stuff like a dream, way better than my previous car, a 2004 Dodge would have. I feel very safe with the Onstar, and the airbags and all the safety features. Only downfall is that my boyfriend is 6'4"" and he doesn't fit right in the car when driving. He is very cramped and says that the high panels on the doors feel wierd. "
pontiac,vibe,2009,Dvd67, 02/19/2009,"Great Value, Fun to Drive",4,"I purchased my Vibe GT in Oct. 08 and have since put 10,000 miles on it. I find the car very fun to drive and nibble in city traffic, much more so than my old Pontiac Trans Am GTA. The 2.4L has plenty of power to do just about any task you ask it. The interior home is amazing for a small car and the cargo area is more than spacious. Driving in snow and ice is a breeze, at times you almost forget it should be slick conditions. The fuel economy has been pleasing with an average of 28 mpg. I have had as high as 31 mpg and nothing lower than 24 mpg. It's a great sporty little car with economy in mind."
pontiac,vibe,2009,ken, 02/18/2009,My car,4,"I picked the 2.4L base automatic over several other models.I have 7000 miles on it.I have had several issues with it the center caps kept coming off,the steering column had a noise in it when it hit a bump. The dealership found the electronic box on the bottom of steering wheel is bad and now the dashboard pieces that were taken off will not snap together. The plastic clips seem to be very brittle they break off easy. The XM radio is great as long as you don't go through mountains or valleys or even under shade trees signal will go out.The 2.4 has lot of power would not recommend 1.8. I've been averaging 26 mpg city 35 mpg. highway. The wheels make car stand out."
pontiac,vibe,2009,Richard, 03/01/2009,Reliable Winter Driving,4,"Had the car for only two months. Its the AWD model and it gets up our 300 ft 25-30 degree sloped paved driveway even before it's plowed. It handles great in all conditions. I enjoy sliding in and out of the cabin with ease.  Some minor complaints, would be the trauf that the windshield wipers sit in. It gathers snow and ice. I wish the ignition area would lite up at night.  The car is getting about 23 miles to a gallon on mostly highway driving. Could be due to the cold weather and it's not broken in yet?????"
pontiac,vibe,2009,bill, 04/16/2009,"Outstanding Value, a Few Minor Issues",4,"I've owned my very fun-to-drive Vibe GT for ~2 weeks and so far I love it, although I agree with others that there are a few things that it could use improvements which keep it from being a 10.  I love the styling compared to its competitors (much cooler looks compared to Versa, Matrix, Fit, '10 Mazda3[what did they do to this car's front end?]).  I love the value; it has everything you need a few great extras, and you can get a loaded GT for ~$19K if you shop around (again better than the competition).  Nice standard extras are Monsoon w/ XM radio, OnStar, steering wheel controls, leather accents, ABS, traction, 18"" alloys.  Also love the cargo versatility of the hatchback."
pontiac,vibe,2009,andunn, 04/20/2009,Great Car but has a few flaws,4,Pros: Toyota Engine -Great gas mileage -Sporty look  Cons: Noise every time you go from park to drive and start to move.  It is the anti-lock breaks kicking in.  Drove three others.  Same thing.  Dealer said it was not designed very well because you could hear it kicking in.  - XM radio cuts song title information off.  I had XM 5 years ago and my radio could display the entire song.  Cuts it off even if you switch to non-flashing mode and have to push info button.  Bad design!  - Doors make a slight vibrating noise when closing them.  Again tried 3 others and same thing.  Body design flaw  - Little noises coming from the dash area even when driving on a smooth highway or road
pontiac,vibe,2009,Q, 07/28/2009,Great buy right now,4,"I just purchased the 2.4 2009 vibe with manual trans.  I offered $200 less than the TMV and they accepted my first offer to my surprise.  Great car and if you want to buy one, offer a ridiculously low amount to start with.  They are practically giving these away with all the incentives.  I wanted the 1.8L, but couldn't find one.  The 2.4 is more than enough power, but I still get over 30 MPG with 50/50 driving, so I'm very happy.  Manual is fun to drive and very comfortable.  Cargo space is great, as I can fit my bike in the back without taking any wheels off.  Sound system is great.  I switched from a huge suburban to this and I don't regret it.  Cash for clunkers program is a great deal."
pontiac,vibe,2009,LJ - california, 10/13/2009,2009 Pontiac Vibe GT - great!,4,"Purchased used with only 12k miles.  2.4L (toyota camry) engine and 5 speed auto/manual a great combination.  This is not offered on the Toyota Matrix.  GT model rims/tires are nice, but noisy on rough roads and you feel the bumps.  Versatility and appearance are better than average.  Handling is excellent because of full independent suspension, wide/low profile tires and sport tuned suspension.  I did my research and compared to Matrix, Versa, Mazda-3 and Fit - Vibe GT model won out for best combination fuel economy, performance and SUV type features in a compact hatchback.  GM warranty a plus (100K powertrain).  Mileage should be around 30+ on highway."
pontiac,vibe,2009,scared in snow, 01/12/2010,scared in snow!,4,"We just bought a 2009 awd vibe for my wife. We live in Denver and had a good size snow. She called from work her 1st day driving this vehicle. It slid all over the place!! could hardly stop at stop signs & would just slid when turning! So i drove it when i got home, she was right! I do realize it is light but even with the ""snow feature"" awd kicked in, it was scary. The tires are very good--low profile, perhaps if we changed to regular tires? any Thoughts?? Very disappointed in Denver."

pontiac,vibe,2009,badgerfan68, 03/17/2008,As fun as it looks....,4,"I've had my '09 Vibe for about a month and really enjoy it.  I have a GT w/ the 4sp automatic.  The vehicle is responsive with excellent acceleration and the steering is tight and active.  We've already taken a weekend road trip with the vehicle and comfortable carried my wife, child, dog and all the necessary gear associated with the aforementioned.  On the highway, we achieved 30 MPG, in town around 25 MPG.  The ride is very smooth and quiet, with minimal road noise. There are no squeaks and rattles so far (which drive me crazy) and the fit and finish is clean and tight.  Storage room is ample for compact car."
pontiac,vibe,2009,09Vibe, 03/26/2008,'09 Vibe base first impressions,5,"Purchased a base model with automatic. Compared to previous generation model, improvements in interior ergonomics and performance were immediately evident.  I especially appreciate that the car comes standard with side air bags/StabiliTrak/ OnStar, even in the least expensive model.  Standard sound system is wonderful and includes XM radio. Overall, I'm extremely happy to be a new Vibe owner!"
pontiac,vibe,2009,good value, 03/30/2008,09,4,"2.4 engine really makes a difference, a little roar under hard acceleration but overall quiet with a decent ride. Good value for a mini crossover. Better seats than before and improved driving position w/added tilt/tele. Brakes stopped ok. Should receive more attention this year from people of all ages because of value and utility. Definitely upgrade to the 2.4."

pontiac,vibe,2009,09Vibe, 04/03/2008,Follow up comment,4,"Just a follow up to previous posting. One strange item missing from base models is variable intermittent wipers.  After driving in the rain today and thinking that the option must be a separate add-on, I went back and checked the Pontiac website to find that they are not available on the base model. For those living in rainy climates, it's an annoying omission by the manufacturer."
pontiac,vibe,2009,Joe Ozone, 04/13/2008,Best Pontiac Ever,5,"I've had my Pontiac for a little over a month and I love it. It's the best Pontiac ever. It's great on gas, which is a great thing when gas prices are so high. The salesman that sold it to me told me that the engine is a Toyota engine and I did my research and he wasn't lying. The car has the durability of Toyota on a great American design!"
pontiac,vibe,2009,Vibe Owner, 04/20/2008,New 2009 Vibe,5,"I love my 2006 Vibe and purchased it due to the reliability in northern snow, gas mileage & the height of the seating, head room and the ability of additional load capacity when the back seats are down. I also love the side covers that protect the bottom of the doors and around the tires where road rocks put pings on most autos and hurt the paint.  Your new 2009 Vibe has changed most of the good features by lowering the height of the auto, making it less apt to maneuver in deep snow. Lowered the angle of the windshield at a loss of head room and removed the protective side panels so the new 2009 would look sportier.  "
pontiac,vibe,2009,Albany Vibe, 04/22/2008,GM builds a solid car,5,"I had been researching new models (Honda Fit, Yaris, and Versa) when the 09 came out.  Was pretty much set on a Nissan Versa.  The Vibe was only about $2000 more than the Versa comparably equipped. With the added features not available on the Versa (ABS, disc brakes all around, stability control, traction control, XM radio, On Star, and hands free phone) it made the Vibe a very nice upgrade. I now have 1300 miles on it, and have averaged 32.6 mpg 50-50 hwy/cty.  The 5-speed is very smooth and nicely placed high on the floor.  Ride is great; performance is more than adequate while delivering excellent gas mileage.  Really a nice car."
pontiac,vibe,2009,smokiescat, 04/28/2008,"Practical, economical and lots of fun",5,"A very nice way to put 14 minivan years behind me.  Like minivans, my Vibe is practical and versatile. Unlike minivans, the Vibe is economical and fun to drive. But the Vibe GT is a few details short of perfect.  I exchanged the 18-inch wheels standard on the GT for the 17-inch wheels optional on other models. I lost some tight cornering ability but gained a whole lot more in noise reduction and comfort. Blind spots force me to trust the mirrors more than Id like. I had back-up sensors installed to allay fears that I would back into something or, worse, someone, such as the grandchildren who live with us. I would have also appreciated an in-dash compass.  Still a great ride and purchase."
pontiac,vibe,2009,Larry S. Pitts, 05/04/2008,2009 Pontiac Vibe-GT,5,I only have about 600 miles on this car as it was purchased in late April-08. So far it has more than met my expectations. I traded in a large SUV that averaged about 14mpg. The 1st tank of gas I put in the Vibe averaged 26mpg and was all in town driving. I was very surprised that the 2.4-4 cyl engine had the pep that it does. It's a great car to drive.
pontiac,vibe,2009,sassls, 05/16/2008,Exciting New Ride!,5,"After test driving the Highlander, the Equinox, and the Vue, we test drove the new 2.4L FWD 2009 Vibe and drove it home.  We have only owned it a week (purchased 05/09/08) but have found it to be a practical but fun family ride.  Gas mileage is as promised and should get better when the car is broken in. Great value for the money."
pontiac,vibe,2009,Mark, 05/19/2008,Good car,4,I had a 2005 that I bequeathed to my graduating college senior.  I knew I wanted another Vibe but was a little too late to get the last of the 2008s with the sweet rebates. 2009 Vibe is basically the same though the car's cosmetics have changed.  There's no longer plastic cladding and bump strip nor the nearly useless roof rack standard.  The change is supposed to be better looking but it looks more like a Prius or Versa now.  Maybe not quite as young looking.  The interior cosmetic changes are mostly an improvement but I really had no problems with the way it was before. Maybe the car is quieter now. Standard features in the 2009 make the slightly higher base price still a great value.
pontiac,vibe,2009,hauppa, 05/19/2008,2009 Pontiac Vibe GT,5,"Car is great looking and is great on fuel as well. The lights go on automatically when it gets dark and with the sun roof the Gt 2009 Pontiac Vibe is an eye catcher. So many people stop and look at the Vibe. Has so many neat items that all work very well. AC works great, heater is great, wiper at the rear window is great, heater in the back window is helpful on a cold day to see things with the rear view mirror. Has a great radio and a jack to enter ones own music. Well all I got to say it is a great or nice car for almost anyone."

I downsized to a new 2008 Vibe due to mobility issues for my beagle and myself.  It  has met every expectation and beyond.

pontiac,vibe,2009,Steve Hughes, 11/08/2020,'09 Vibe GT,5,"A Pontiac on a Toyota platform! Best of both worlds - the GT pkg has handling and power enhancements like sport suspension, 4 wheel disc brakes, 2.4 liter Toyota engine, GT trimmed seats and sunroof, 17"" mag wheels, etc. And with only 113,000 miles, should have another 100K in it. Perfect first car for my grandson.

pontiac,vibe,2009,Tony, 11/19/2020,"Paying th price of owning a ""hybrid""",4,"2009 Pontiac Vibe (1.8L 4 cyl 4A ). Practical/versatile and economical. I have generally liked this little hatchback/wagon. Durable and reliable Toyota power train.This model has the same power train as the Toyota Corolla and Scion xD (made by Toyota) Power is  so-so but fuel economy is good at 30mpg combined consistently.Merging onto freeway traffic made me  long for the Camry engine  (2.4 L 4 cyl ) available on the Vibe GT model only..Provided you have good tires this Vibe goes through snow well and the extra weight -and cost was not worth it for me. I preferred the shape of the Vibe over the ""cousin"" model Toyota Matrix particularly  for the 2009 model year..Nuisance  issues were few.The shift indicator light went out at 110K.The radio control knobs became wonky shortly thereafter. More importantly the PCM  (power train  control module )    failed at 175 K :-(  Because it is a General Motors part of this ""hybrid"" it took a while to order and receive  :-( The Vibe is a second vehicle in my household and it's availability was sorely  missed. Cargo/people flexiibility is a plus especially because split rear seats fold  leaving a handy FLAT  cargo area that is generous in size.Four passengers fit comfortably and five in a pinch.The vehicle is ON-STAR and SIRIUS satellite radio capable if you want to pay for those subscriptions. The ""styled steel wheels"" showed signs of surface wear and required repainting -a universal issue with any vehicle that has them. The upside is the  lack of alloy wheels contributed to the great gas mileage.And replacing the original Pontiac wheel covers with  aftermarket ones is an inexpensive undertaking.No issues with the power windows/locks/cruise  or dealer installed security system. Air conditioning and heat/defrost / rear window defroster worked well.All climate control knobs worked well. Overall-i would recommend this car if you need a flexible/practical fuel-efficient vehicle with a power train that has Toyota's history of reliability. There are several brands out there with odometer readings similar to mine  (175K miles ) that would make me more anxious driving-particularly long distance.
"
pontiac,vibe,2010,Rob, 02/22/2017,Great Value & Utility,4,"My Vibe is a former rental car that I bought with 30K miles on the odometer.  I've put 110K more miles on it, with replacement struts and a new battery the only non-routine maintenance in seven years of ownership.  The Vibe is very reliable, gets good fuel economy (31 MPG highway with the 1.8L engine), and handles like a compact but has the passenger/cargo space of a station wagon.  I have found two issues with it--the flip side of the 1.8L engine's fuel economy is that it has sluggish acceleration.  There's also a common problem with the radio volume knob breaking...which I fixed by sawing it off and slipping a new one on.  That said, I love this car.  It has a combination of versatility, value, reliability, and handling that's hard to beat.  I'm planning to drive it until it breaks--which could take a while.

pontiac,vibe,2010,nbaatb, 05/18/2012,"Great, Fun Car!",4,"I bought my 2010 Vibe in 2011 and have been driving it now for a little over a year and I love it! I'm surprised as to how much get up it has- zippy is a good word. I love everything about it. I can fit my three large dogs in the back, and the seats are high so they don't like to jump over. There is leg room in the back to actually fit people in. More room then our RAV 4 by far! I get around 25mpg city and 30 hwy. The only thing I don't like is the blind spots. The car has limited visibility and that is the only problem I've had. I also love the plastic in the ""trunk"" easy to vacuum up dirt/dog hair. I can lay the seats down throw my bike and dogs in too. LOVE IT! "
pontiac,vibe,2010,Mike Joseph, 03/29/2010,"Noisy, Poor outward visibility",3,"I have driven this car only for two weeks and my first impression was how small this car is and fits so much inside. It took me a while until I got used to windows and mirrors, its hard to see everything from these little windows so I was always worried about the blind spots. Also the way the hood was designed there is no way that you can see the end of the car or at least if you are close to hit something. The way the car handles is really good, it lacks power but what can you expect from a 1.8 liter engine.   The main issue that I had with this car was the road noise, its so weird that you can never get comfortable when you drive on a highway from the noise level."
pontiac,vibe,2010,wade, 02/02/2010,"RECALL, but wait!",4,"purchased with the help of GM points and cash for clunkers program. So, what's a good GM vehicle? Ouch, me too. Guess what, the Toyota built (80%) with a pontiac skin, is GM's best car! Check out the rating guides,it's Gm's best period! Ok, looked at it, and wow! Sporty look, interior room is suv like. I'm serious. AWD,great for wisconsin's winters. It's funny, I've read other reviews and zippy was mentioned often. My wife and I nicknamed the car ""zippy"" when describing the ride and feeling we get when driving. But, now  we have a re-call on this vehicle! 100% fact. My service man has said we will recieve a re-call letter from Pontiac. We are @ the bottom of the food chain. Minor I hope!"
pontiac,vibe,2010,jeronomo, 01/24/2010,Great Purchase,5,"This is actually the 1.8 L auto which is not listed as an option on Edmunds. This is a great under the radar car.  It is compact enough to get good gas mileage and fit in small spaces but still feels spacious inside, with a lot of possible cargo room.  I like the exterior styling better than the matrix (it's twin) or the fit. No problems so far!"
pontiac,vibe,2010,Karen K, 09/12/2009,Great Value,5,"With carpools days now behind me, I was looking to replace my minivan with something that still offered significant cargo space but got better MPG than the non-hybrid SUVs on the market.  Chose the 1.8L Vibe and am very happy with it's versatility, handling and economy.  At age 52, I got my first speeding ticket while ""grooving"" to the XM radio tunes when driving it on it's first turnpike ride.  I like to think of this ticket as a testament to my enjoyment of the smoothness of the ride and audio system on my new vehicle. With it's excellent safety features, reliable Toyota engine, MPG and interior space, I think the Vibe is an exceptional value."
pontiac,vibe,2010,Dan P., 11/17/2009,Great car,4,Bought the last new Vibe GT in the northeast. Traveled almost 200 miles. Worth every mile. Great acceleration with the manual trans. Comfortable seats. Roomy enough to store all my junk and then some. Better looking than the Toyota Matrix. Even my 9 year old son likes the looks of this car. I stole this car for $15k after all the discounts. Finally I have a car that I enjoy driving.
pontiac,vibe,2010,budman, 05/26/2010,Glad I bought it,5,"Really like the car.  Rides nice, handles better than expected. Got 35.5 MPG on 600 mile trip. Have 11000 miles on it and no complaints.  Used Clunker money, GM rebate and GM card rebate. Paid 9900.00 for a new car.  Thought that only happened to other people.. Plus GM 5 year/100,000 mile power train protection."
pontiac,vibe,2010,manitoba1, 06/23/2012,Reliable car,4,"We have put on 80,000 km with no issues to report. We like the gas mileage and cargo space. Very good on ice and gravel. Noisier and less room than our sequoia, but a lot more practical for 2 or 3 people."
pontiac,vibe,2010,Chelsea Michigan, 11/26/2009,"Excellent, fun car so far",4,"Bought a '10 Vibe as part of CARS program -- it was very hard to find one in stock, they sold like hotcakes.  We wanted a base Vibe, stripped down without add-on features (not even a/c), but couldn't find one.  We wound up with a 1.8L and manual transmission, but with a/c.  But that's OK.  It's a very good car -- we really enjoy it!  Our only complaints are the pretty tepid highway acceleration (which can be scary when merging onto highway in front of trucks), and the bizarre location of roof antenna, noted in many other reviews, which makes it hard to do much with roof rack."
pontiac,vibe,2010,Jim S, 11/18/2019,Phenomenal Vibe,5,"Best car I have owned, peppy, handles well, no maintenance issues with over 116,000 miles on it.  Have done routine maintenance.  It is my car for hiking, gardening, and work projects; thus it is a bit beat up on the inside but that is my fault.  "
pontiac,vibe,2010,ultrawolf, 08/16/2009,Good Soild Car,4,"I drove a '10 Vibe, 1.8L, automatic transmission rental for a week, and put 1100 miles on it, almost all highway miles.  My wife and I both own '09 Honda Fits (me-Sport, her-Base).  Compared with the Fit, the Vibe has a smoother, softer ride, and the powertrain is also very smooth.  It shifts very smoothly and the engine has decent enough power considering it's only a 1.8L.  Even downshifting to 3rd gear at 70 MPH climbing hills, the engine doesn't sound like it's going to rev itself to death.  Overall, a very competent car.  But, compared with the Fit, pretty boring, not at all ""sporty"".  Also, the windows are small, and the high door sills make you feel like you're sitting down in a hole."
pontiac,vibe,2010,Dakovich, 08/19/2009,Last of the breed,4,"We purchased the 1.8L with optional Auto tranny. We went with the Vibe over a Scion XD for many reasons. Better looks, better interior, way more comfortable, seats go up/down, tilt/telescope wheel, more room, larger cargo area, similar mpg, still a Toyota basically so equally reliable, and the GM warranty beats the Toyota/Scion one. 1.8L Auto has plenty of juice for us, we're not aggressive drivers but it has get up and go when needed. We like the tight suspension and steering which takes bumps surprisingly well. Not many 1.8L's left around, lots of 2.4L's and AWD's though. We Didn't want to trade mpg for the extra power."
pontiac,vibe,2010,Robi Robo, 02/06/2010,Deception,3,"Purchased to replace an old Audi Quattro, it is the worse car I ever drive and a huge disappointment: uncomfortable with those checky shock and hard seats, bad gas mileage (around 21-22), boring to drive and unefficient AWD. It is the first time I was stock on my driveway and this unsecured feeling on wet/snow roads. We though that was because on the tires, But tire Plus told us it has the best tires for the car."
pontiac,vibe,2010,Joey S, 08/16/2009,Only OK so far,2,I've had this now less than a week. Purchased with a clunker trade in and GM card points. Never would have picked a GM car otherwise. I'm taking a lot of abuse at work for its ugly exterior styling. I'm experiencing the same issue others have mentioned with the tranny in that it down shifts as soon as you let your foot of the gas. Also with only 140 miles the paint has chipped and is rusted. Nice huh? We'll see what the dealer says but I'm not optimistic. I won't do GM again. Iderad having to deal with the service department.
pontiac,vibe,2010,Gary T, 08/20/2009,Great Economic and Stylish Choice,4,"The CARS program paved the way for the wife to research cars that achieved 30+ miles per gallon and the Vibe came up as a strong contender in the fuel economy arena. After learning that the current model actually came out in 2009, she proceeded to research reviews on last years model and discovered that the '09 Vibe had achieved a very respectable 9 out of 10 Edmunds ranking and very favorable reviews across the board. Dealer inventory in our area is disappearing at a rapid pace so the Vibe has deservedly caught on in Pontiac's  11th hour exit. We both agree that this is indeed a vehicle that shouts reliability, comfort and economy and if performance is lacking, we don't notice. Impressive!"
pontiac,vibe,2010,Darryl, 12/18/2009,Has to stop and think about accelerating,3,"It has a hesitation, a miss, a delay in acceleration, a hiccup after stepping on the gas.it is obvious to me all the time and there to catch my attention whenever I try to go. It's not a shift issue, shifting up & down is fine. The problem is: step on the gas at 20 mph it dips its nose then goes, or step on the gas at 30 mph it dips its nose then goes, or step on the gas at 40 mph it dips its nose then goes, or step on the gas at 50 mph it dips its nose then goes, and so on. Kinda been snubbed by my dealership's service department on this, not sure if their problem, GM's issue, or what."
pontiac,vibe,2010,Snoop, 08/07/2009,Great Car,5,"Great car in its segment.  The redesign in '09 blows away the out of date/style (ugly) ""ribbed"" & rigid look of the original.  The engine is peppy enough and the car is surprisingly fun to drive.  Spacious interior with efficient layout.  Great gas mileage & sturdy build."
pontiac,vibe,2010,Preston Oles, 08/22/2009,nice,4,"Fun car I can get all my stuff in it or on the roof it does everything I need it to do and then some. Radio is great, head lights are super bright everyone loves the rims (18s on the gt) oh and fun to drive too. Good car for the price. To bad its gone for good. I got one of the last cars with  the Pontiac badge and a cool color (orange) I feel lucky!"
pontiac,vibe,2010,Love this car, 09/05/2009,We love this car,5,"We purchased this car after waiting three months for a Chevy Equinox and we couldn't be happier.  We switched from a Saab all wheel drive SUV to a smaller better gas mileage car.  The car is very zippy and handles great.  Although its size isn't that of an SUV, it does have plenty of room even with a baby.   After a full week with this car, we love it. Every Vibe owner we talk to loves their car after 3 or 4 years.  This is unusual for any car.  We are happy and if you are looking for a decent size car with alot of options for a great price, take a look at a Vibe if you can find one. We couldn't locate many within a 50 mile radius in S. Florida.  "
pontiac,vibe,2010,Janda, 09/08/2009,A Good Vibe!,5,"We picked up our new Vibe just in time for a family trip - loaded the boys, the bikes and the bags and put 700 miles on pretty quickly.  This is the best purchase I've ever made - I love it, I'm glad i got one in time and wish they were still making them."
pontiac,vibe,2010,duvy, 10/14/2009,happy so far,5,"nice ride overall for a small car, it is fast and runs smooth. bought in august for $ 16000 out the door. base model no power windows or locks,steel rims,but bought aftermarket rims and it looks nicer."
pontiac,vibe,2010,gregg n, 10/25/2009,i love this car,4,"i replaced a 2003 base vibe with the 2010 gt. wow! we love it. i do miss the rear opening window, the luggage rack, but it is so fun to drive. i anticipate that my biggest concern in the future will be the paint quality. i fear that pontiac knowing they were shutting down cut back on the amount of paint applied to the car thinking what will the consumer do about it. except for that, i really love the car."
pontiac,vibe,2010,Jo Hughes, 10/09/2020,Its A OK. First Car,3,"I Purchased My 2010 Pontiac Vibe/Toyota Matrix 3 Months Ago, Its Equipped With The 1.8L And 4speed Auto. Il Get into the Pros First. The Steering Is Beautifully Weighted And Never Leaves Me Guessing, It Really Is A Fun Car To Drive. There is lots of Space In This Car For What I Need It For Like Driving Around With Friends. The Interior Is Simple But Clean And Pleasant. The Car Has Aged Quite Well And Has Had No Serious Mechanical Issues (My Example has 743,987km). This Car Is Honestly Not Bad For A Start. Getting Into Some Cons, There Is Alot Of Minor Things. The Shocks Are God Awful, I Commute just shy of 500km Per Day And At least 100km is On Surface City Streets. At Normal Speeds It Feels Like The Shocks Aren't Even There, Concrete Blocks Would Be More Effective. Its Ok On Gas, Not The Best Out There But Not The Worst. The Small Gas Tank Really Leaves A lot To Be Desired. This Is More Of A Personal Issue But The Car Is Extremely Sluggish. I Understand That This Is Not Meant To Be Fast But I Shouldn't Have To Put My Foot To The Floor To Get To Freeway Speeds In A Reasonable Amount Of Time. This Car Has Been Checked Time After Time And It Is Not A Suspension Issue, The Car Becomes Unpredictable And Floaty At 80km/h (50mph), Not Sure What Causes This But Its Really Annoying And Sometimes Dangerous. My Final Few Complaints Are For People That Like To Do They're Own Work. Changing Your Headlights Is Harder Than It Needs To Be, The Placement Of The Tubing, Wiring And Other Engine Components Is Inconvenient At Best. The Car Is Also Difficult To Jack Up Due To The Poor Placement Of The Plastic Side Skirts. Finally This Car Like Many Cars, Has A Heatshield Issue Where The Heatshield Comes Loose And Makes A Loud And Distracting Rattle And Taping Sound When Driving Or Even Idling. In Summary, If Your Looking For An A To B Machine This Car Is A Good And Reliable Car, However, Expect To Be Visiting The Pumps 3 to 4 Times Per Week, Trying To Guess Which Way The Car Is Going To Wander Next, And To Be Tossed Around When Driving On Surface Streets.

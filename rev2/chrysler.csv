chrysler,300,2005,marivr, 04/10/2015,2005 chrysler 300 limited w/3.5L.,4,"In 2005 my dad bought this car new. While he maintained it Well I (now 21) grew up with this car. He used this beauty for work which meant the trunk was always full of construction equipment. Its now April 2015 and I inherited the car And drive it regularly.  
Point being the car has 271,000 miles And still drives like the day I rode home in it. Its never had any work done. Just oil gas and tires. Best car ever. "
chrysler,300,2005,Greg Caron, 09/26/2016,Dream car,4,"I fell in love with these cars about 8 years ago when I had one as a rental. When it was time to buy another ""new"" used car I shopped specifically for this. I had quite a time because I wanted the C model in black with lower miles. I ended up driving 630 miles to & 630 miles back to get it & I love it so far. The C is loaded & has a Hemi...I recommend the Hemi for the power. It only gets 2 mpg less than the 6 cyl 3.5 & I average over 25 mpg on freeway. The interior is very comfortable, it brakes very well & handles well. The sound system is awesome but because the car is 11 years old the navigation system is outdated & has no touch screen or back up camera. For the price of the disc required to update I can buy an after market unit that has all of these features & it will fit right into the dash w/o modifications. There are outstanding airbag recalls that I will have to take care of & the worst thing is that when you fill up the car all the way it stalls. This is a known problem with this & several Chrysler cars & fortunately about 2 years ago they finally agreed to extend a lifetime warranty to the gas tank which will need to be replaced. I have arranged to take it in to dealership & this work will be free of charge. Overall for as nice as this car is, with only 75,000 miles & for the price I paid...$8750 I believe its a bargain. They are out there to be found but some dealers think they are worth $10-12k...Don't pay that. Find one & stick to your guns. Many of the dealers who initially laughed at my offer are now calling me ready to sell after sitting on there cars for a couple months...but of course they are too late.

chrysler,300,2005,jersey guy, 07/10/2010,I Stole This Beast!,5,"Second 300, this one is a Hemi.  The salesman told me it was driven by an old lady, of course it was!  Truth is I met her and it was all true. Her husband died and she had to get rid of it.  It has 11,965 miles !! Every option and it is very fast and very comfortable.  I just back from a trip to Vegas, averaging 75 MPH.  At 110 degrees out with the A/C on I still averaged 22 MPG.  I only use Regular gas and it runs fine.  This is a keeper for a long time. Buy one, they are out there for good prices. You won't regret it!"
chrysler,300,2005,Gmedina, 07/31/2015,Awesome ! High perfomance car!,5,"I just bought an 05 300 C SRT 8 and I'm loving this car! it reminded me of my prime time when I used to have a 77 Trans Am ! I never taught I would see another car like that 77 (performance and handling ...even looks)and this SRT 8 really exceeded my expectations.

chrysler,300,2005,Griff, 07/16/2006,simply honest,5,"great car.  always turns heads with its great design.  i can not go anywhere without being stopped by men and women alike asking ""how do you like your 300,  i love the look and wish i had one!""  i'm proud to drive and own this fabulous Chrysler product.  the other car makers are scratching their heads and wondering what they are going to do next to compete.  go drive one for yourself and see what all the hype is about...you will not stop thinking about the car untill you have one.  thanks Chrysler!  "
chrysler,300,2005,DE Austin, 12/12/2009,Lord blessed me with a great find,4,This car can go -  This car is loaded and drives and acts like a luxury car or a fast sports car...Now I am the one asked to driver everywhere.  I think Chrysler and Dodge get a bum rap!!  The great Lord blessed me with an awesome find...
chrysler,300,2005,marlonm, 04/03/2010,Great car,4,"I have 121,000 miles on my 300C and still love the car. In general, it has been reasonably reliable and is certainly fun to drive. I would buy one again."
chrysler,300,2005,homer, 08/16/2006,My Chrysler,4,"Look me Over but please don't touch is how i feel about my Chrysler. And thats what I get. A lot of lookers and nice car. What is it ? I drove the 300 in the sixties and now in the 21 century. What a car. Nice to drive and I feel very safe with all air bags the electronic steering system and the AWD.I drove big brother the Merc's and yes a little softer ride but thew 300 is great. If I have one comeback it is the navagation system, for $1400 it could be a lot more and the car arrived with a data disc three years old in development. The tires are not wearing as they should I am getting 1/2 tread todate and only 15000 miles no help from the dealer or the tire manufactor ""Contintal."
chrysler,300,2005,GooseLyne, 08/17/2009,A Dream,5,Sole owner from 3 miles to recently rolling over 145000. Five years of ownership and all I have replaced is a EGR Valve last May and a rear speaker that I blew out myself. To compare this car to a Audi or Honda or Toyota is a huge mistake. They have no where near the same in-cab room and feeling of comfort on the surface of the road. The low-long body allows for tight turns and an excellent grab on the pavement. The small V6 is well enough for highway and in-town acceleration. There is no other car (under 30000 dollars) on the market with an average MPG of 25 to 28 and a presence on the road of captivating aesthetics and size that can swallow similarly priced sedans.
chrysler,300,2005,G1NA3C, 12/23/2009,My Experience,3,"Exterior aesthetic appeal is undeniable, however interior budget cuts are evident. Leather is cheap, and not supportive - sadly MOPAR engineers have yet to achieve a benchmark ride akin to Cadillac/Lincoln. However as prior owners of both, neither can compare to the pure acceleration and road manners of 5.7/340hp 300C.  Approaching 100k (5W20), w/ no mechanical problems to mention. Still avg range 320City/+400hwy varied elevation/region/driving conditions including snow. Very powerful, compliant, and forgiving platform. Thoroughly do the research and test drives, the Hemi is kicking with class leading fuel economy. On a more juvenile level, it just feels good."
chrysler,300,2005,arhashim78, 03/11/2012,A true American Can,4,"With this car Chrysler put the American car on the map again.
It is an example how an american car should be.
Big powerful engine, rear wheel drive, appealing exterior, roomy interior with reliability and a lot of luxury. 

This car is such a phenomenal car.
Although it is an 05, yet it is an eye catch. with its beautiful chromed rims, spectacular front inspired from the 1958 300C.
Also, my car is black so I think that adds more elegance to it.

It had 112000 miles on the odometer when I bought it and today it has 124000 miles yet I haven't spend any penny on any kind of reparations."
chrysler,300,2005,m rizzi, 07/07/2005,"""Car of the Year"" Performance",2,"Thought you'd like to know how the ""Car of the Year"" has performed for me. Here is the repair record for my 300 Limited since 7/30/04:  Right Lead/Alignment - 4 repair attempts; Clunking Noise in Rear End - 7 repair attempts; Defective Door Panel - 1 repair attempt; Recall for Radiator Brackets - 1 repair attempt; Electrical Problem w/Driver's Window - 4 repair attempts; Defective Seat Riser - 2 repair attempts; Defective Air Bag Sensor - 3 repair attempts; Electrical Problem with Wipers - undetermined(part on order).   "
chrysler,300,2005,Mike, 04/06/2006,SRT8 300C,4,"I love this car. Its by far the fastest car I ever had. It has every option. Everything works fine. The main problem I had is with the front spoiler it was so low that I went over the parking block at the gas station OK but when I backed up it pulled the whole front end off. It cost me $1500.00 to fix it, I then did it again at the bank so I took it off and it fine now."
chrysler,300,2005,jwaters, 07/31/2004,Solid & Powerful: A great value too!,4,"I love this car. It's very solidly 
built w/ no rattles or creaks. The 
sound system is quite good and the 
acceleration/handling is very 
impressive for a big sedan. The only 
really negative I can think of is the 
high beltline which impairs 
visibility, but is worth it in my 
opinion as it gives the car 
a ""chopped"" look."
chrysler,300,2005,Kendo, 08/14/2004,Fun Car to Drive,4,"I love this car.The ride is smooth, 
quiet and cofortable. I love the 
attention it get's when I drive down 
the street. The price was a real bonus. 
I expected that a car looking so 
expensive would cost a lot more than it 
did. A couple little drawbacks...The 
high beams on the turn signal arm 
sometime go on by accident sometimes 
while signaling a turn. Also, I found 
the windows a little hard to get used 
to. I mean they seem small and I feel 
like my veiw is limited. "
chrysler,300,2005,RG, 07/15/2005,Fit and features,4,"Great looking car. Fun to drive with ample power. 3.5L is not as quite and smooth as some Japanese 4 cyl. engines, Lots of standard features. Excellent interior finish. Outside visibility when turning turning left is limited by the big rear view mirror and the wide front left colunm. "
chrysler,300,2005,Sandy and El , 11/02/2006,Fedup with Run Around,4,"Love the style and handling of this car, BUT problems started with blown fuses/bulbs, AC wouldn't get cold, headlights blow when weather turned cold (replaced 3). Pinging started, engine light came on (code P0405, cyl misfire). Chrysler recommended detonation process (remove carbon from valves),no help. Several more visits with engine light on (same code), found a crack in head gasket. Replaced head gasket(Aug 05, 8,000+ miles). More visits for blown fuses--wire burned at muffler, replaced front control module. Jun06 started having bad vibration in gas pedal and engine light on again. Removed carbon again-- 99.9% sure fixed, 2 days later vibration back. Currently pursuing lemon law.  "
chrysler,300,2005,Larry Perkins, 11/17/2006,Style and Performance,4,"A pleasure to drive.  Comfortable and head turning style.  The car came equipped with Continental tires that were awful.  Hydroplaning and poor mileage (switched after 20,000 miles)   I switched to the Goodyear top of the line and what a difference."
chrysler,300,2005,CSM102E, 12/20/2006,Styled like my 1950 Merc,5,"Although told it looked like a Bentley, I thought it looked like the 1950 Mercury, I had as a teen. It even has RR drive. Has vision problems that you have to be aware of. It's a real eye catcher. After 2 years, am still pleased with it."
chrysler,300,2005,Jim, 05/19/2007,Chrysler 300C 5.7 Hemi MDS,5,"Fun to drive on a long trip. Great power with good gas mileage. Very good handling. No problems with vehicle after 34,000 miles. "
chrysler,300,2005,MountainMan, 10/31/2020,My lava red 300C,4,"I have always wanted a Mopar but could never afford a classic Cuda or Challenger. So I thought how about a modern Hemi with Daimler Chrysler engineering? I have not been disappointed. The 340 hp V8 power is something I have longed for most of my adult life. I have only ever owned 4 or 6 cylinder vehicles. Not only is the power appreciated but so is the nicely appointed leather interior, wood grain finishes and chrome rims. It is quite the luxurious ride. Cons: These big beasts are notorious for poor gas mileage (400 kms to a tank) along with front end issues and I can tell my ball joints are loose and will need replacing soon. Also, if you are tall like me (6’3) with a long upper torso you will have to crouch or duck a little to see the stop lights at an intersection. The seat positioning is too high. Overall, however, I am enjoying “Hemi” as I motor through my midlife crisis.

chrysler,300,2005,outwest, 07/27/2009,300 touring,4,"I was looking for a used car that was as good as a 04 Dodge ram diesel,  in power mpg,  I didn't want another repeat of the durango, then we had the p t cruiser,  that tin box would be o k, if we stayed in the city, but on the road  I did not like the  risk,  first I was surprised about this design on the 05 300, then I looked up the specs, better economy/power then the p t we had,  and a real car, for a change,   we installed yakohama h rated 215/65/17 tires and it is important to note the h rating, for the pure fact the car handles very well with these tires we bought the extended warranty , 23.6 mpg,  however I was not driving with a steady foot, finally a real car  true road car ,"
chrysler,300,2005,Art, 09/08/2010,Eye Catcher,5,I Know many people are power crazy but I go for looks and performance.Why have power if you cant use it? I have a 2005 base model that is better looking and performs as good as the more expensive models.I dressed it up and that's why it stands out next to the other models.I have a friend who has a C model and when parked next to each other mine is the eye catcher.The slower I drive it the more people see it.
chrysler,300,2005,Dan, 03/08/2006,?,4,Very happy with the car great acceleration with the 250 hp and very smooth. Only one minor complaint is that the car seems to bottom out very easily.
chrysler,300,2005,CRYSTAL YOUNG, 05/03/2006,Weak carpeting,4,"I am overall happy with the vehicle, except for the fact that I have holes in the floor on the driver side and the carpeting is coming undone! I have contacted Chrysler and the dealership for assistance, but to no avail. The floor up front is weak, as if something was missing from the building process. I would like to know whether or not any other Consumers were having the same if not similar problems. A new car should not have carpeting wear and tear at this stage. I have 60,000 miles on my vehicle now, and it is time for a front end alignment. I make sure that I do my regular maintenance on time. But the carperting is my main complaint. "
chrysler,300,2005,3 sets of tires, 12/02/2006,3 sets of tires,4,"This is a great car and my second 300. My first was a 300M bought new in 1999 and that was a fun car, but the 300C is by far the best car I have ever owned. If Chrysler keeps this up I will buy another one. The 300C SRT8 is the next one on my list."
chrysler,300,2005,Worried, 08/23/2006,Worried,3,"I have had this car since December and find myself when sitting at a light or a stop sign it feels like my car is going to stall.  It downshifts and feels like it's going to stall -  Or it feels like someone has rearended me sometimes -  the first few times that happened I thought the car behind me did hit me.  It has been happening more and more lately - and has also stalled out on me a few times while just waiting to turn -  I took it to the dealership and they said nothing is wrong - however, something is wrong -  I also had a recall on my transmission with something - which they say has nothing to do with it but hmmm? I'm not sure what to think at this point.  I just want to make sure I "
chrysler,300,2005,B.G., 09/03/2015,GREAT CAR,5,"I have this car since 2007 & it is one of the best cars i have had in the last 30 years !!!!!!!!!
"
chrysler,300,2005,dave h, 07/07/2006,Overhyped,2,The Chrysler 300 is the most over hyped car in the past couple of years. Last winter it seemed to be one of the worst cars on the road for handling snow and ice. It is especially poor for the size and weight of the car. Visibility is also very poor.
chrysler,300,2005,Hemi Heavy, 07/22/2008,Great Car!,4,"Purchased my 300c Used with 72,000 miles.  It looks and drives like a brand new car.  No clunky noises, squeaks or groans.  Even who rides in it thinks it's a brand new car.  The ride beats and 5-Series BMW out there.  Very happy with this purchase.  I would recommend driving this before committing to a higher priced ""luxury"" car."
chrysler,300,2005,bagman, 08/04/2008,VERY Impressed,5,"Best car I've ever owned!  Drives smoothly, and is so comfortable.  I have been getting 22 to 23 mpg in town and 27 to 28 mpg on the highway.  I have absolutely no complaints with this car.  I've owned other car makers' vehicles, but this Chrysler is far and away the best of any I've ever owned.  It is a vehicle that turns heads everywhere I go.  It has a classy feel and has amazing power!"
chrysler,300,2005,mikem, 12/18/2007,"The best ever, so far",5,"I hade a numbers of cars in my life span but never have I had a car that have been that reliable and comfortable as my 300 Touring. I love the design and my fuel economy have improved by adding a cold air intake to the engine. Fast, lots of torque, enough horsepower to maintaine the speed on the freeway at any time I drive. I had the car for a year and i bought it used with 10000 miles on it, now after 30000 miles it is going strong with not what so ever problems. If I would consider to exhange my vehicle I would probably buy a new SRT 8 this time with no considerations at all."
chrysler,300,2005,CHRYSLERS 300, 07/24/2009,My 300 T,4,"This car is one of best I every had, If not the best. No new parts or trouble just a set of tires in three years. Fun to drive and good mileage."
chrysler,300,2005,joe, 10/02/2009,very dissaified owner of a 300 limited,2,i bought my 300 limited new 2005 first problem the left back and quarter panel primer was showing through the paint took car back to dealer car was repaired. At 49000 miles car would smoke out the exhaust when started after setting over night using almost 2 quarts of oil in 2000 miles seals around valve stems were shot 1500 dollar repair bill. I have traded this vehicle no more chrysler card or truck in this household.
chrysler,300,2005,Robert Clarke, 08/01/2010,"Second 300, I Love the Hemi!",4,"I have heard the ""owned by a Little Old Lady"" line before.  This was True!  I met her and she is a 75 year old lady and it was her husband's baby. A 2005 with 11K, gotta love it! My second 300 and I am glad I got the Hemi this time. This car has every option available."
chrysler,300,2005,Raydal, 05/27/2005,3 shop visits,4,"Its a great car, except, its been in the shop already 3 times, first time was a recall about the radiator, second time, ""it needed a new muffler to get rid of a loud rattle noise"" they had to keep the car for 2 weeks, now the third time ""same raddle noise, needs a new exhaust, and sunroof seal is coming off, and automatic power windows stoped working"", its been 2 weeks now, and still dont have my car back.  It makes me wonder what lemon did I buy, since the car is brand new, and in less the 8 months I have had this many problems."
chrysler,300,2005,Noe1, 07/27/2005,Jade 300 Lmtd,4,"What can I say, I love this vehicle.  From the boxy exterior design, to the muscle under the hood, indeed it is a future classic.  I'm into luxury, and the 300 is just that and more."
chrysler,300,2005,Al G., 12/31/2005,Great looking vehicle but......,3,"We purchased this vehicle in May 2004 and have had nothing but problems since. Vehicle constantly pulls to the right, molding falling off, moon roof shades opens on its own, rear windows occasionally dont open, ie. electrical problems. Great looking and priced vehicle but check consumer web sites to find many owners with simular problems. Based on Chrysler Corp. not willing to help with many of these problems, we are trading in for a different vehicle. Never a Chrysler again."

Dodge Magnum, are the best products to 
come out of Detroit in nearly 30 
years.  "
chrysler,300,2005,Clifton Rhodes, 07/27/2006,First Class,4,The only problem i had was that Chrysler didn't put the right tirer on the hemi. When these cars came out we had to purchase them with out own money. There should have been a recall and also on the air bag part that eventually short circuited and cost over $600.00. Beside that this is an excellent care i really enjoy my car.     
chrysler,300,2005,Steve Sheets, 08/03/2006,Midlife Crisis Solved,5,"Handles very well. Power on demand.  All options except sat radio, and AWD. Nav system works great. Continental tires caused it to lead hard right. Tread depth half gone after 7000 miles on all 4 tires. Chrysler and Continental refuse to correct problem. Chrysler has issued 2 service bulletins about leading off. Had to buy new tires myself. Since replacing tires, no complaints. After changing all lubricants (engine, tran, diff)to Amsoil synthetics, hiway mileage at 60 jumped to 31.5, combo city/country 15 mile work commute mileage =24.8. MDS engine system works flawlessly so far. Parksense, rainsensing wipers, sound system, works great. Body styling turns heads. Makes you smile while driving"
chrysler,300,2005,tndinca, 06/26/2004,On the right track,4,"I rented this car for a week recently. I had heard the 
hype and was intrigued. Currently own a Saab and 
Bmw. Best features were drive train, interior space 
and styling. Was evident that Chrysler is trying to 
upgrade interior quality and I liked some aspects: 
the seats in particular. Suggest they need to keep at 
this as still below import competition. I would pay 
more for this car to to get improved material/detail 
quality. Examples: radio control knobs, steering 
wheel, door and trunk latches. Perhaps the 300c is 
nicer, but I suspect same issues. Trunk latch on my 
rental did not work and was very low quality. Could 
not close the trunk easily."
chrysler,300,2005,ldatty, 09/10/2004,A Comfortable and Stylish Sedan,4,"This is one if the finest cars I have
owned in the last 20 years.  There is a
great combination of smooth ride with
precise handling. The is like the luxury
cars of the past, but with greatly
impoved handling qualities.   The fit
and finish is good, and I have found no
defects. The one area that could use
some improvement is the interior.  There
is too much gray plastic on the dash and
door panels. However, the leather seats
have a nice appearance and are very
comfortable.  This is one I would
recommend to anyone who is looking for a

set my eyes on it. I've had no 
problems with the car thus far. The 
exterior is amazing with a retro chop 
top look. And one of the few cars that 
can hold 22 inch wheels. The interior 
on the other hand could be much 
better. Hopefully the feature models 
will get a interior upgrade with less 
plastics. "

Cant see the lighted dials in the day

Complicated radio controls."
chrysler,300,2005,SpiceUmUp, 11/28/2004,Beats the Bonnevile,4,"This car replaced a 2002 Bonneville.  
While I liked the Bonneville, it was 
time for something new and the 300 is 
IT.  Handsome, striking in appearance, 
roomier than the Bonneville, it is 
quiet, rides smoothly and handles 
securely.  The 3.5-liter V6 has plenty 
of oomph for most situations.  The car 
lacks certain amenities standard in 
the Bonnie: Automatic headlights, tire 
pressure sensor, 6 speakers 
standard.  The 300 has leather 
standard, the Bonnie does not.  The 
300 is much roomier than the Bonnie 
is, and rides much better.  The cruise 
control stalk is not a great
design, GM hasn't gotten that 
right either. Chrysler saved money on 
the interior materials."

chrysler,300,2005,Ed, 06/07/2005,No Quality Checks on this car,3,"I have been back to the dealer many times over the last 6 months for these problems:  1) Even on minor grades, car will roll backwards in drive when I take my foot off the brake.  2) Car shifts hard from reverse to drive.  3) At low RPM acceleration, car up-shifts hard from 2nd to 3rd  4) Generally poor quality control on the painting.  The first time I bought gas I noticed the paint primer clearly visible on inside of gas cap door.  First time sun shinned on the side of car I noticed the interior metal of the rear wheel wells was bare.  5) I have been listening to the same radio station for 22 years on my 52 mile trip to work.

Has been in the shop for 8 days now and dealership can't figure out the problem.  They've taken the transmission apart and are waiting to hear from Chrysler on what to do next.  I've submitted my 15 day notice to Chrysler to have it fixed or give me back my money per my state's lemon law.  Needless to say, we're greatly disappointed."

Fitzsimmo, 08/24/2005,Great Car for a Woman,5,"Not only is this car georgous, but it is extremely comfortable, has great pick up (so I can get on those expressways), and reliable.  My gas mileage is at 25 mpg around town and 30 on the road.  My mechanic tells me that once I hit 10,000 m., it will get even better! I also like the fact that the control of everything is right at my finger tips. I don't have to take my hands off the wheel for hardly anything! Not one day has gone by that someone hasn't asked me about the car. They all fear that it is expensive because it looks so good!  I assure them that the price is within the reach of almost everyone. We have owned many cars over the years, but I love this car better than any!"
chrysler,300,2005,Ontario Glen, 09/03/2005,Excellent Crash survival,4,"This is the first Chrysler that I've owned and I loved every minute of it... until Aug 31 when I got T-Boned. After that I Love AND Respect it.  The car performed exactly as it should. I was hit by a van running a stop sign. A square hit to the rear drivers door and rear tire. The car started to spin until the ESP kicked in and straightened it out, because of that the car went straight into the ditch and didn't slide sideways and roll! The rear seat was contacted by the door panel but no breach into the passenger compartment. No windows broke. This is an example of excellence in design. Thank-you Chrysler "

I am 5'7"" and I have been driving many years and this is the first vehicle where this has been an issue.  I am used to an SUV but still I don't think I should have this much trouble.  I have the seat up but the top of the doors are still to the top of my shoulder.  I am trying to get used to all of the blind spots that this is creating for me.  I don't want to have to sit on a pillow!  Otherwise, I love my 300.  I am getting some additional exercise too as I am not parking it next to anybody..."
chrysler,300,2005,Wilie, 06/09/2006,excellent,4,This car is a fun car to drive.  It responds as soon as you step on the gas. The handling of the car at top speed is moderate.  The comfort of my car is excellent.  It's very spacious and the detail of the interior is cool.  The exterior of the car is like an eye candy to people.  Every where I go I get compliments on the car.

chrysler,300,2005,Thornton, 12/05/2006,Excellent Car,5,"This car has been one of the greatest cars I have ever purchased.  You cannot beat the comfort you experience on the Road. This car handles like a dream on the road.  It has good gas mileage whether you are on the road of just doing average city driving. For the price I would recommend this to anyone looking for the elegant look, but affordable. We own a cadillac Eldorado and I prefer this car over that one any day.  I am tall and it gives me the leg room I need for comfort, along with the fact that three adults can seat in the rear with total comfort."
chrysler,300,2005,Bernie, 12/11/2006,Sensible sedan,4,"For the money there isn't another car that can hold a candle to this Chrysler 300. Now with 30,000 miles on it, we are just as pleased with it as when it was new. Dealer service here in a small town is a little less than I would like but they have backed the warranty completely on various small items. The most negative feature I can think of is the paint. We have the black and it seems to be very brittle, allowing rocks to readily chip the front end. "
chrysler,300,2005,Haywood B. Joiner, J,Chrysler 300,4,"The Chrysler 300 is a fun car to drive and has the appearance of a much more expensive automobile. I have had problems with the window motors in three of the doors (windows would not go down). All three window motors had to be replaced. I have also had problems with the child locks on both rear doors (when child lock is off adult passengers cannot open rear doors, so I have to get out and open doors from outside of the vehicle). I have had this problem checked, but it continues to reoccur. I have also had to have both sun visor clips replaced. They broke off a few weeks after purchase. Both of my fog lamps, for some reason cracked. I don't think rocks caused the cracks."

Williams, 03/26/2008,Still love my Chrysler 300 Touring,5,"I have owned my car for four years, it has given me dependable pleasure, comfort-style-and the dealership has been great to keep my car in top condition.  I have no problems in the winter, my car always starts under the coldest of conditions, in snow if you go slow as conditions require you will be able to drive on most surfaces and hills.  I have had the following parts replaced under warranty since purchase: Motors for front seat and car door windows.  Extra battery in trunk replaced. Most recent part replaced, is a compressor went completely out, the dealership covered the cost leaving me with labor only.  I have low miles considering I am the only driver of my car.  "

Power windows keep failing and digital read out mysteriously converted to German. MPG is average. If you don't keep the vehicle tuned up, it is atrocious.

Put well over $4,000 into the front suspension alone. I also had to replace fuel pumps and the radiator.
Overall, i put about $6,000 worth of repairs into this car before something in the engine finally gave out and totalled it.
I will never buy another Chrysler."

The only expense I've had is oil changes and tires. It's not as nice as a BMW, Mercedes etc. but you will not have to pay for costly repairs. Again, is not as smooth a ride as other luxury vehicles or as nice, but not having the head aches make it worth buying. "

driving along I hear a loud popping

It's as if the frame around top of

chrysler,300,2005,V8 Ecstacy, 04/02/2005,U should have a V-8,4,"This car draws a lot of glances, parked or moving. It's appearance is reminiscent of the chopped stock car body. It's size and weight(4500 pounds) belies it's quickness. It can deliver enough torgue to the tires to generate sufficient smoke for a three alarm fire!! No problem in accelerating from 50 to 70 MPH. The interior is well appointed. The GPS system has been an added plus in reaching destinations in unfamiliar areas. Buttons on the steering wheel provide the driver with full capability to check the various program systems. The analog clock provides a bit of nostalgia for those of us over 50. It's grand to experience a V-8 again and I'm not talking about vegetable juice!"

The electronic fuel system in the computer goes out and you can haul the car away as trash according to the dealership. They did not make interchangeable parts like they did 160 years ago. Chrysler management is that stupid. It cannot be fixed according to the dealership. The car is in pristine condition and worthless.

Now, I have a very expensive paperweight on my hands I don't even dare drive. The car loses power at speed, locking out all control, making me a ton rock in the middle of the road. It now sits at the dealership, where they say ""their computer can't find a problem."" This is the FIFTH time it has been into the shop for the same problem. Chrysler's response when I contacted them? Tough luck, lady. Trade up to a new 300. It's paid for, so they aren't making any money off it.

The ""Bentley Lite"" exterior styling is solid & bold, not stuffy. Per Car&Driver a Bentley has marginaly upscaled cup holders ... and can be yours for only about a 1/4 million more than a loaded 300C @~$40K.

handles extremely well. I still have a 93 Dodge 
Intrepid which is a much noisier car. I have a fairly 
new Volvo Estate which also compares much less 
favorably in terms of road noise. So Chrysler has 
learned something about insulating out road noise 
since 1993!

The cut-out from eight cylinders to four at speed 
works wonderfully well. In a 6,000 mile trip across 
country and then back and forth from Utah to 
Colorado right afterward, I found that the 
advertised 25 miles per gallon is just what I got.

The interior is big even for my 6'4"" size in front or rear seats. The comfort is great with good support in the seats and well thought out controls.  The Mercedes influence is very apparent with good handeling and a solid, quiet ride. The american muscle under the hood is well worth the money and makes highway onramps and long trips effortless.

chrysler,300,2005,Art, 02/03/2009,Love It,5,I had some great cars but there is something about my 300 that makes me feel good when driving it or looking at it.Its a base model with cool vanilla paint with a sun roof and a six cylinder motor.I read a comment saying the base 6 is sluggish which I have to say is not true.I have friends who have the 300 with 8 cylinder motors and I cant see much difference.I had a 4 cylinder Mustang and my 300 is better on gas.Im not sorry I got the base because its still an eye pleaser with more than enough power which people remark about when riding in it.
chrysler,300,2005,Marlonm, 02/14/2009,300C stands the test of time,4,"Just wanted to write-in after 88,000 miles I still love my 300C as much as the day I bought it. I have had a few, mostly minor problems (headlight, EGR valve, cam sensor, differential seal leak, nav button). All of these have been covered by 100K warranty. Still have yet to replace the brakes! Gas mileage is excellent (22 combined MPG) as long as I don't mash the pedal too often. I would buy this car all over again if Chrysler is still around in a few years."
chrysler,300,2005,charles lewis, 02/23/2009,Problems with my 300,4,"Mileage 183,000. Engine is shot, it has a broken wrist pin. Gas gauge broken, had to replace rotors every 40,000 miles, suspension has gotten weak, car sways a lot. I am having to replace the engine, total cost: $4,200. I am not a happy camper. Period. I loved this car, hope to have put 250,000 miles on it. It did not happen! Running lights are always getting hit with debris and going out"
chrysler,300,2005,Sameer Sinha, 03/13/2009,Problems Problems,3,"I bought this car as second owner with 32,000 miles 8yr/80000 Pt warranty and 3 month 3000 bumber to bumber. I have visor clips break, Trunk release break, Lighter switch break. Suspension is noisy with loud Thuds, Brake is noisy with sqeeks, underbody rattle, steering hardens in clod temperature, Cruise control failure, steering system wearing and all this in 13 months or by 65000 miles. The car is too low to bump the speed bumps in shopping mall parking lots. Speakers are poor quality with sound distortion at 40% volume. REar wheel is terrible to handle in winter with snow, my first and last experience."
chrysler,300,2005,LarryC, 04/03/2009,One of the best cars I've ever owned,4,"A car hasn't made me feel so good since my Trans Am in 1979.  Other than scheduled maintenance, the car has never been in the shop.  With 20"" chrome wheels and low profile tires, the car still looks fresh and brand new.  "
chrysler,300,2005,Art, 06/05/2009,Eye Catcher,5,"Hi folks,I have a 2005 chrysler 300 base and Im suprised hearing some of the bad reviews about the base model.I read where people said it dont have power and thats not true it has more than a person needs plus great on gas. Only the people who are speed crazy would think that.Also some say its interior is cheap which is not true people who see it loves it.I see many 300s for sale with torn leather.Also people knock the steel wheels with hubcaps on them.Nothing wrong with that at least a person can change the hubcaps at a fair price whenever they want to while other owners are stuck with high priced wheels.I have friends who have the touring model and  mine is more eye cathing."
chrysler,300,2005,Tony, 08/26/2009,My 300C,4,"I love this car, most fun driving it than any car I've owned in over 40 years (including an early 60's T-Bird and a '67 Cougar). After 4 years with this car I still get lots of looks and comments about the style. Wife won't even let me consider buying another car. Car is comfortable to ride in, and has more legroom than a friend's Lexus. "
chrysler,300,2005,mary L. Robinson, 10/24/2009,rocker panel,4,"love car, but have had some unusual  problems, like the rocker panel dropping off. Has anyone else had thia problem? Had to replace brake rotors and pads at a cost of 743.00 at 22000 miles . Brakes still squeaking, even when I'm not braking. Just had to have suspension work done that cost me 1100.00 and replacement of rocker panel me 389.00. all of this on a car with 49000.00 and also a new set of tires. the originals were so worn."
chrysler,300,2005,PU, 06/08/2010,Great value and performance,4,"I just completed my 6th year of ownership with my 300C.  I had to have one and bought when it was introduced and you had to grab 'em off the truck at full MSRP.  great performance, comfort and reliability has been solid. only issues: eats tires and suspension is getting soft all else works like new "
chrysler,300,2005,AJ, 12/03/2004,I bought a Chrysler,4,"The 300C is the only car which could tear my 95 Impala SS out of my hands.  With the advent of newer technology and hemi power, I could not resist.  This is my 1st chrysler. The ride is excellent.  Handling is on par with a car its size, but Pirelli M+Ts or some other tire will improve it.  The power is there - no question about it.  The autostick will downshift if you rest your hand on it, so be aware of that.  The dealer did a terrible job of prepping the car, so I spent 8 hours using prewax cleaner, clay barring the paint, and then waxing it.  The factory paint is *not* on par with GM, however, the time I spent made a big difference.  I would say buy one, but only a hemi."
chrysler,300,2005,Robert Beebe, 12/09/2004,It Turns Heads,4,"This is the perfect car for men who are tired of driving mid-size V6 cars that scream middle age father of two.  The power is awesome and the styling and comfort are top notch!  The only thing that could be improved upon is the slight understeer, which is not that bad.  The fuel economy is not as good as expected on the highway, but with that much power, there is no reason to complain.  I have owned this car for four months now and almost daily I receive some kind of compliment on the car.  This car rocks!"
chrysler,300,2005,Cliff, 12/21/2004,New Owner,5,Very enjoyable car to drive with more than sufficient power and excellent handling capability. Also an eye- catcher. I've had more people stare and stop to talk to me about the car that I've ever experienced.
chrysler,300,2005,Lance, 01/07/2005,70's Chrysler Style with Benz Flair,5,"I am a liflong auto enthusiast, collector and Master Automobile Technician.  I have owned over 200 cars from AMC to Pontiac, and have serviced or repaired probably 10000.  The new 300C is the most exciting new automobile that I have ever experienced, by half.  What first strikes you is the styling, which for me said 1973 Chrysler, which itself had styling ques from various 50's Chryslers.  The stance is masculine and aggresive.  The HEMI V-8 delivers enormous power and torque yet impressive fuel economy; about 24 mpg average for my driving habits.  I just can't praise the new 300 enough without writing a dissertation about it's virtues!  Just drive one, trust me!"
chrysler,300,2005,Garry, 01/12/2005,Nice Car All Around,4,"I was looking to replace our 1998 Mercury Grand Marquis and was seriously considering a 2005 Mercury Montego(the Ford 500 twin)and on the way home from that test drive we dropped in our Chrysler dealer and took out a Black 2005 300 Touring.  Needless to say for roughly the same price the 300 is miles ahead of the Mercury, and we bought the 300 right then and there. It is a very nice car. It performs very well, is roomy and I enjoy driving it.  We took it on a 400+mile trip and it was a great ride all the way. I recommend it 100%"
chrysler,300,2005,Gregory F.Smith Sr., 01/12/2005,Young Again!!!,4,"Needs lockable console compt.  Only getting 11-12 mpg in town, acceleration grabs when given gas, needs diferent tires upgraded, needs tinted side windows darker. It is a fun car to drive, outside of suvs and pickups, this is the first regular car I have bought since a new 1964 Pontiac gto with 3 duces, so I am really feeling young again.  Chrysler has a real keeper here!!! Keep it up!!!"
chrysler,300,2005,Dano, 01/12/2005,"Hot...and a Great Value, too!!",4,"Gr8 looks, fun to drive, great ride, nice solid feel, flat on the corners (what a change from my SUV!!), powerrrrrful, classy, & feel safe.  Nice to see MB features incorporated (I've had 3 MB's b4).  Mine is fully loaded w/ALL opts. Mileage a bit sucky (15) so far, hoping it will improve. No disappointments but think many small things overlooked.  1/2 pwr pass seat is tacky, NAV shld not require CD/Radio be playing to function (have to mute), my arm slips off windowsill as it's too narrow, even tho my seat is all the way down I still have to lean over to rest arm on armrest (I'm 6'). Headrest is annoyingly too far forward, can't adj.  Auto seat-move-to-rear stops func if u touch mem recall."
chrysler,300,2005,Charla Hemme, 01/29/2005,Love This Car!,4,"Love this car.   It is a real head- turner, too.  We bought a black 300C this month and my husband and I both love to drive it...but it's my car and I let him drive it sometime!  All the guys at work love the way it looks like a muscle car but also looks like a luxury car.  The black metalic is just beautiful.  We also looked at a Silver one at the dealer that was gorgeous but decided on the black.  A lady I work with wants one now....she drive a black Lexus and was thrilled to see all the bells and whistles that my car has but the Lexus does not (for a tremendous difference in price!).  What a bargain this car is!  No other luxury car can come close to the price for the options available."
chrysler,300,2005,300cAWD, 01/31/2005,Finnaly a great american car in AWD,5,"AWD is amazing, i tested both the rwd and awd, the awd is amazing on michigan roads and even helped when pulling out after snowstorm that michigan took. Amazing car and i am getting the tires replaced(not the rims) to 245x55x18 size. Better traction than the continetal and wider tread means more rubber on the ground. The visibility when looking out cant see the traffic light. But who cares when pushing the gas on the green is smooth. I use the auto-stick alot amazing power and tire streaks on the road.(HEHE). The interior is well done and no complains."
chrysler,300,2005,C. Posey, 02/12/2005,Best Car I Have Ever Owned,4,I am in my late fifties and have owned many luxury cars.  This is by far the best and most fun auto I have owned including ones far more expensive.  Handling is exceptional and the Hemi is like no other.  There is no comparison on the road today.  
chrysler,300,2005,Frank, 02/15/2005,Love it or Leave it?,4,"After waiting over three months to take delivery of our Chrysler 300C, it finally arrived. An extremely well assembled unit, nice fits inside and out. That all lasted about three weeks,and then the problems started. With no warning whatsoever, the battery was totally dead,and we're now working on number four battery! Just one electrical problem after another! More often than not, it's back to the dealer so they can search for the problem. In 3-1/2 months we have managed to drive it 1349 kms (800 miles) Things such as  dash warning lights (engine, ESP/BSN) inop auto wipers, inop daytime running lights and who knows what's next! Other than that, a beautiful car...wish I could drive it!"
chrysler,300,2005,Jim, 02/15/2005,300M to 300 Limited,5,Had a 99 300M with 47000 on it and loved the look and drivability. Limited was just a great looking car with overall appeal for its looks and reliability ratings. 
chrysler,300,2005,leasesqft, 02/17/2005,Baby bentley,4,I just purchased the car.  I always drove a 8 cyl...This car has just as much power or more with the v6 on the limited edition than i did with my sts cadillac.    Loads of leg room ..Navigation system a must have...Great family car  unreal truck space....Everyone looks at the car ...Worth every penny so far.  I love it.
chrysler,300,2005,NQUP, 02/26/2005,What a improvement,4,Owned a 2001 and 2003 Chrysler 300. This car outdoes every category from performance to comfort. It is very much noticed the German Auto influence when driving.
chrysler,300,2005,Werner M. Reitter, 02/26/2005,"why spending $15,000.00 more for a BMW 5",4,"This car is fun to drive in every respect! A real touring car, quiet and comfortable. The Navi works excellent, but should be able to be operated at any time! Very recommendable! Drove five BMW 5?series and would not spend the additional $15,000.00 again!"
chrysler,300,2005,rahthrift, 02/28/2005,A Real Head Turner,5,I can't say enough good things about this car.  Strangers tell me what a beautiful car it is every time I drive it.  It is the smoothest ride imaginable.  Both my children instantly fall asleep in the roomy backseat whenever we take a ride.  It really is a great value and quite a car.
chrysler,300,2005,schesman, 03/02/2005,happy and proud 300c owner,4,"Love the styling and the solid feel of the chassis.  Can't count how many people have come up to me to ask questions. Everybody is very excited about this car.  Engine is smooth as silk and very strong.  Tranny does its job well too.  Seats, gauges, nav system and stereo are great.  Small windows look great and I have no problem with the outward visibility.  Negatives: Bins on front doors are made of really cheap plastic. I have a few interior rattles that are bugging me, but no more than any other car I have owned, including so-called quality benchmarks like Lexus and Acura.  I have owned them all and this car - whether it is American, Canadian or German - competes strongly on all fronts."
chrysler,300,2005,Pam, 03/25/2005,It's HOT!!,4,I have had my 300 Limited for about 60 days and almost everyday I get some very positive remarks from people about how nice that car looks.  It's a real head turner!  Don't let the Hemi fool you.  The 6 cylinder Limited with AWD has plenty of power and agility.  I suggest getting the NAV and SIRIUS.  I never use a map anymore and I'm nodding my head to the beat of the music all the way to my destination.  It's HOT!
chrysler,300,2005,Archi, 03/25/2005,"""Took me a while""",4,"I would have written sooner, but I was busy driving this car.  It took me about 4 months to finally purchase this vehicle and I love it!  I have driven Mercedes, BMW, Acura, Cadilac etc. and I continued to come back to the 300 Limited.  Didn't really need the Hemi, and I wanted to keep my payments at a certain amount.  This car handles beautifully.  I cannot believe the looks I get in this car.  I have the ""Brilliant Black"" and I love the paint job this vehicle has on it.  Debating on whether to get bigger tires then the factory 17 inch clads that come with it, but it seems to be nice the way it is.  There is not much to add to this beauty, it comes with everything you need and more!"
chrysler,300,2005,Mima, 03/27/2005,Lovin it,4,"This is a wonderful vehicle people Love it, gets alot of attention. this is the most comfortable and sexy vehicle I have ever riden in. it's just like your own personal limo."
chrysler,300,2005,FRANK BARCELONA, 03/29/2005,I can't say enough about it !,5,"   I ordered the 300c in june and it was delivered in late august. It was worth the wait. We get alot of attention everywhere we go. The traffic down here in florida is horrific, so the power of the hemi engine and the suspension work well getting in and out of traffic.I would recommend this automoblie to anyone. This is the best car i ever owned and i plan to keep it along time --it could be a collectors item someday !!!  "
chrysler,300,2005,Aldo, 04/15/2005,Awesome car!!!,4,"Best car I have ever driven.  It is fast beyond belief, handles and stops like a true sports car, and can carry 5 people in absolute comfort.  The engine growls like music.  Feels solid and fit and finish is remarkable.  The suspension is firm yet comfortable.  Such an attention getter: turns heads wherever I go, people walk over and ask me about it.  "
chrysler,300,2005,Mike Burton, 04/16/2005,"Pleased with my ""C""",4,"This vehicle is my first ever Chrysler product.If they continue to produce the combinatioin of value and quality I have found in my ""C"" it will not be the last. Very high marks all around. The car feels very solid, and the acceleration is effortless at any speed."
chrysler,300,2005,Chris Keser, 04/16/2005,Zero traction on snow.,4,"Great car styling and ride as well as other features, but absolutely HORRIBLE on even the slightest amount of snow, even with after market snow tires on all fours. Truly DANGEROUS. Rear wheel drive is a big mistake if using the car in areas of snow accumulation. Traction control seems to be no help at all even on a 1/4 inch of fresh snow. Rear wheels just spin."
chrysler,300,2005,Theodore Madzy, 05/01/2005,Why I Like my 300C,5,"I just came home from a two month 600 mile trip that was a pleasure. The days that we traveled were 600 mile days and never did I experience any discomfort.  The fuel economy was much better than I expected, 28 mpg. Everything worked as expected and the ride was great. Everyone I met thought it was a sharp looking auto. I would recommented this vehicle to anyone."
chrysler,300,2005,rjm, 05/13/2005,6 months and lovin it,4,"Bought this car in Nov and love driving it every time I get into it. Great power when you need it, great ride and quiet Owned Lincoln LS and Continental before and no comparison"
chrysler,300,2005,dale foster, 06/01/2005,dales hemi,4,"I have been a car freak my entire life,show cars and hot rods have been my passion, I have had my cars featured in hot rod magazine and engines annual, so I know cars. The 300c is the 15th new car I have purchased and is now my favorite. Everything designed into a car has some sort of compromise, you want to go fast? Usually rough idle and poor milage. You want to go thru a corner at high speed? forget a good ride. The 300c has blended all of the things I love in a car in such a way that I can't find any major flaws in it. It is plenty fast, it handles very well, the ride is certainly acceptable as is the fuel consumption. The guages are well thought out and steering wheel controls are great"
chrysler,300,2005,DB, 06/01/2005,I love it!,4,"My 300 is awesome!   Love the drive, love the look.  It's fun because my 14 year old nephew thinks it's an awesome car and yet I have older people also stop me frequently to tell me how much they like the look. Definitely crosses generations. :-)  Don't like: the dark interior, shows every spot of fuzz.  Wish I had leather instead of cloth.  Still wouldn't like the dark carpet.  I clean it one day and you can't tell the next.  Problems:  Only problem I've had is that sometimes while idling it acts like it wants to die.  I scheduled maintenance last week, but wasn't able to make it in.  Will try again and see what the problem is.  "
chrysler,300,2005,mad man, 06/08/2005,car is a flop,2,I bought this car last year. i got one of the first ones.  Well it has been nothing but touble. The car is stalling at all speeds and engine light comes on and off. There is a problem with these cars and Chrysler is trying to keep it under wraps because it was named car of the year and is selling well. If anyone else is having engine problems and stalling post it on this site. 
chrysler,300,2005,L. CARL WIESCHENBERG, 06/11/2005,An almost perfect car,4,"The car drives like a top european car. Even the doors close nicely. Finally there is an american car where the drivers seat goes far enough back for people with long legs. Lincoln told me, if i sit in their car on the rear seat, i would have enough legroom, but how do you drive that car then."
chrysler,300,2005,thomas haines, 06/11/2005,Great car!!,4,car is excellent on the road especially during long distance trips.  car performance exceeds my expectation at all times.  Compliments and inquires about car makes me proud to be an owner.
chrysler,300,2005,Don Yates, 06/11/2005,Conservative Show Off,4,"Everytime I return to my car in public parking there are people admiring it and asking questions.  I say the car matches my personality.  Aggressive, fast, yet highly sophisticated! People usually walk away at that point!  I doubt Ferrari owners get this level of attention!"
chrysler,300,2005,Chet, 06/11/2005,Great Car,4,"My AWD C model is a 2006. I'm very impressed with this car. I came off a BMW 745i Lease, and this car for almost half the money is so much better with more options. Finally an American car that can keep up with the European's. I'm so glad I purchased this car, I feel it will have good re-sale value. I'm also impressed with the Hemi engine, very smooth, but I wish they would have made some better rumble from the exhaust."
chrysler,300,2005,Ron, 06/11/2005,"Purchased for wife, love to ride",4,"This car truly brings back the days of the 60's muscle cars.  My wife and I were looking for a new car and this time it was her choice to make.  I had been privately salivating over the 300C, but never made mention of this to her.  She said, 'let's go test the 300C, that's a great looking car!""  She test drove it, as did I and the rest is history. The car drives as great as it looks.  Its appeal transcends generations.  At full throttle, it will push you back in the seat.  This 4100 lbs. beheamoth can rocket.  It handles nicely, especially on the freeway. The car is comfortable and the interior is roomy.  Neither of us have experienced a claustrophobic effect as reported in CR. Great car!   "
chrysler,300,2005,Rick Cardinal, 06/11/2005,fun fun fun,5,I traded in my SLS and bought this car. I have owned cars from 1962 to 1964 vettes to 57 chevy's to 454 Chevelles LS6 and although I did not buy the Hemi I did drive one and with two small kids I went with the v6 do to pricing since I have a 6000 sq ft Victorian that costs more to keep up than any hot rod but the car has been awesome and even though its a v6 it still has the cool body and when I am crusing the highway at 95 it feels great. As for any law inforcent officers reading that I was just kidding. My father had a Rolls Royce and when I pull into my Grand Queen Ann I feel like I am in a Rolls Royce. I live in a very high end area and it gets as my stares as any high end cars on my roa
chrysler,300,2005,William1, 06/11/2005,Luxury with sporty feel,4,"I have enjoyed the 300c more than any car I have ever owned.  My wife has a Lexus 430 and I would much rather drive the 300c.  It handles great, has plenty of power and the look of a much more expensive car.  Besides all of this - It's fun to drive!"
chrysler,300,2005,Donald L Francis, 06/11/2005,Great car,4,I have 5 other cars and this one is the best car I have ever owned.  This car does so much and and it will take me a year to figure eveything out it does.
chrysler,300,2005,JAY, 06/11/2005,Easy rider,4,Just drove 1350 miles from florida to ny in total comfort.You did not even feel any effort in driving. The response of the vehicle was quick and sure. All instruments were always in view and with many controls on the steering wheel you did not have to look down.Was dring most of the time at 80mph which felt like it was going 50mph.
chrysler,300,2005,Ed Hickey, 06/11/2005,The way it should be,4,"I have owend many cars and trucks from cadillacs to corvettes and none have come close to the 300c it has it all  ride, looks and performance. Kudos to chrysler corp they hit a home run!!!"

chrysler,300,2005,Sherri, 06/11/2005,love my 300C,4,I had always driven SUV's. I was a little hesitant about going to a car because my sons are 6'. They said they had as much room leg room in the 300C as they did in the Suburban & Tahoe! It is a blast to drive and I dont think i will ever go back to any other vehicle. I'm waiting for the new 2006 RTS(?) version to come out and will possible buy that!

chrysler,300,2005,Ed Rezek, 06/11/2005,A definite Winner,5,Have had a lot of luxury cars and this is the nicest surprise I have ever found in Fifty Years of driving. Meets or surpasses other high end cars by far. I get a lot more for a lot less with this 300C.
chrysler,300,2005,DISAPPOINTED, 06/11/2005,"Won an award, then lowered the quailty",2,"With less than 2500 miles on the odometer the air bag lite up and would not go out. The defroster  stopped working. Chalk up 3+ weeks in the shop with the interior gutted to replace the defective main wiring harness plus other defective parts  the dealer was great. They didn't mfg the car ,just repaired it. Interior is""cheap"" for a 35k car. Many good things on my 2001 lhs were deleted. Ie good leather seats, instant mileage calculations, seat back pockets,automatic adjusting seat for 2 ,trunk treatment, tilting side view mirrors when backing up.  Display on dash between tach and odometer is diffucult to see and read."
chrysler,300,2005,whistfully, 06/11/2005,Love my 300,4,"As a widow, not knowing much about cars, I depend on my dealership a lot.  My 300 is leased and I have free oil changes every three months which is wonderful.  I know they will watch everything going on with my car and be honest about any problems should there be any.  I love driving my 300, just as I loved driving my Sebring convertibles in the past.  But unlike other cars I've had, the 300 is super confortable, it takes the bumps in the road with ease, I feel safe inside with all the air bags and GPS, and I love the metal flaked paint and sun roof. A little piece of heaven.  "

chrysler,300,2005,Jim Hlavacek, 06/11/2005,One of the Best,4,"Not since the 70's has an American automobile manufacturer produced a large sized sedan that has impressed me enough to own.

chrysler,300,2005,Mike, 06/12/2005,First New Car,4,"This is my first new car ever purchased and I love it! It rides great and handles great. I get compliments on the vehicle all the time and people asking how I like the car. First words out of my mouth are always I LOVE IT! If you are looking to buy a sedan, I definitely recommend checking this one out. My only regret is that I didn't buy an upgraded model."
chrysler,300,2005,Kenle, 06/12/2005,Awesome!!!,4,"My new chrysler 300 is absolutely, the best car I have ever had!  Drives smooth and comfortable as if floating on air AND has guts that tears into the road.  Phenominal.  VERY cozy interior that hauls everyone in comfort with plenty of leg room!"
chrysler,300,2005,Canyonero, 06/12/2005,Wow!!!,4,Now this is a CAR!!! This car is built for true TALL Americans are.  This car is made for TALL people that know what cars were like in the 70's.  This car fits me like a fine glove.  If you are over 6ft like me.  This car is made for YOU.   
chrysler,300,2005,ed b, 06/12/2005,Best car I've ever had,5,"great performance, terrific curbside appeal, fast and quiet - and BEST value for the dollar for a luxury sedan."
chrysler,300,2005,Jim , 06/12/2005,300 C,5,Wonderful car. Definitely a pleasure to drive. Plenty of power and an excellent ride. Well worth the money.
chrysler,300,2005,Keith Rundles, 06/12/2005,Awesome Vehicle,4,This is the best car to come into production since the original Mustang back in the 60's.  Fun to drive and handles well.  I would have paid even more for this car as I had to have it. 
chrysler,300,2005,sara, 06/12/2005,300 review,4,"I love the power of the 300, along with the styling.  I am tall, so it is the perfect fit and I immediately felt comfortable driving it.  "
chrysler,300,2005,James Smith, 06/12/2005,2005 300C,4,This is my best car so far. It has been a pleasure to drive. It has needed only one repair in a year and that was done in the first month. I had a seal come loose on the sun roof. I added the uconnect the first month. I will be a repeat buyer!
chrysler,300,2005,Pat, 06/13/2005,Class Act,4,"I bought the first AWD version to be found in Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana and have now owned it for 6 months.  Handling is very smooth.  Acceleration is a bit slow at low speed but quick and without hesitation after that-- similar to that of the Mercedes line. I show toy dogs and have found the trunk space to be ample for a crate dolly, tack box, folding chairs, and luggage for hotel trips.  Dog travel in crates comfortably in the back seat and the rear air is nice for them.Trip odometer tends to stick and refuse to display the mileage at times. "
chrysler,300,2005,JAG, 06/15/2005,7000 mi trip,4,"Just completed coast to coast 7000 mile trip.  Car performed flawlessly except air bag light and bell went off about every 300 miles, there seems to be and elect problem but did not effect cars performance,will be addressing this with dealer today. Avg mpg 25.9 can't complain. 3.5 engine is a supprise in how quick it is. Still want a hemi but wifes car!  "
chrysler,300,2005,RICKY CROWDER, 06/23/2005,RICK'S 300C,4,"YOU FEEL GREAT WITH THIS CAR. FROM CRUSING TO ROCKITING DOWN THE ROAD. THIS CAR WILL TAKE THE MOTO FROM THE COMPETITION.  GMC'S PROFESSIONAL GRADE, LOOK AT THE 300C. FORD'S BUILT FOR THE ROAD AHEAD, LOOK TO THE 300C. THIS IS THE CAR THAT CAN MAKE ANYBODY FIT IN AT THE AUTO SHOW. IF YOU'RE YOUNG, YOU CAN COMPETE WITH ANY OF THE NEW HOT RODS. IF YOU'RE OLDER YOU CAN PARK NEXT TO THE MOST EXPENSIVE LUXJURY CAR AND NOT FEEL OUT OF PLACE. THIS CAR IS COOL ENOUGH FOR A SINGLE MAN OUT ON THE TOWN, AND CAN MAKE A MAN MARRIED WITH CHILD FEEL AS IF HE'S STILL GOT IT. THE DOWN SIDE IS YOUR WIFE OR GIRLFRIEND WILL WANT TO DRIVE TOO.  THE FINAL WORDS.  HOMERUN CHRYSLER, HOMERUN."
chrysler,300,2005,Matt, 07/08/2005,Best in class by far,5,"I had my eye on this car 4 months before it hit the lot.  By far the best car of its price range.  Handles well, smooth ride and gets lots of looks.  Solid power with the 3.5.  Good gas mileage on the highway (drove from Los Angeles to San Francisco on one tank of gas).  I can't tell you number of times I have been on the road and saw people driving those expensive Mercedes, BMW's and Lexus, slow down to check out my car.  Love the after market products, purchased a Bently style grill and chrome panels for the B-Posts.  Had it for almost a year now and only had one minor recall. "
chrysler,300,2005,John J. Perenyi, 07/10/2005,Chrysler 300 C Hemi,4,"Although I purchased the car for its performance and incorporation of M-B technology, I appreciate the admiring glances and compliments it continues to get.  It is surprisingly economical for a large sedan with such power, and the heralded transition from 4 cylinders to 8 is indeed seamless.  Most of my driving is on highways, and that  is where the 300C really shines. It can cruise effortlessly at triple digit speeds in silent comfort.  Great car!"
chrysler,300,2005,Daniela Rendon, 07/10/2005,the best yet!!!!!,4,Overall this car is the best car yet!!! i am very satisfied with its exterior and interior looks. the only thing is that when stopped at a red light is sometimes shakes like it wants to turn off. that is something that others drivers have expressed as well to me. 
chrysler,300,2005,Arturo Ebay, 07/10/2005,Bravo!,4,"I have never owned an American automobile, other than as a hand-me- down during my high school, and early college days. I've owned a VW bus, an XKE Jaguar, a Lotus Europa twin-cam special, a VW GTI, Schirocco, Corado, an Audi A4 and am now driving an Audi TT. I have driven the 300C and it is the most visually and performance satisfying American automobile in memory! The performance might be enough to get people excited, it is very rewarding to move this large car so  handily, but the ""snooty baby Bently exterior with the touch of ""gangsta pimp"" puts the 300C in the crossfire of strong traditional and contemporary elements. The interior is very pleasing in  details and plenty of room!An A+ !!"
chrysler,300,2005,Randy, 07/11/2005,Love this car,4,Fell in love with this car the moment I set eyes on it. This car WILL turn heads. I can live with the reduced visibility as it is about the only complaint that I have. Had to bring it back to the dealer during the first month due to the six disc CD player skiped for no apparent reason. They replaced it and the new one has operated perfectly. I would recomend this car to anyone. 
chrysler,300,2005,Richard, 07/21/2005,Big Ride for $,4,"A really big bang for the money. Great style, presence, and performance. Very nice 23MPG during easy highway cruising. Great radio, GPS, and sports like handling and large interior space.Appeals to board range from youth to CEO.   "
chrysler,300,2005,dave fed, 07/24/2005,300C hemi rules,4,"The 300c has that great combination of aggressive, powerful good looks and rock solid performance that delivers so effortlessly that you wonder how you ever enjoyed driving another car."
chrysler,300,2005,L. Thomas, 08/16/2005,Poor mans Bentley,5,I love my 300 Limited.  I travel continuously and the ride I get from this car awesome.  I recently had surgery and the car took the bumps on the road like a charm. This car has been on my list every since it came out.  I feel I made an excellent choice in buying this car.
chrysler,300,2005,LuAnn Roesch, 09/22/2005,300C!!,4,As you can see I titled this 300C!! because the car has caused so much excitement.  Never have I driven a  large sedan with as much comfort and kick.  The multi-phase hemi engine provides respectable fuel mileage and the ability to move when needed.  The exterior design turns heads no matter where you are and the ride is excellent.
chrysler,300,2005,Mark Kuntz, 09/22/2005,Best value on the street,4,"This car is by far the best value on the road today in the luxury class. It quietly floats down the highway at 85 MPH, get a radar detector, you'll need it. Unless you live in Colorado or like area, don't bother getting the AWD. I live in Northern Illinois and have the standard Traction Control and Electronic Stability Program and it is all you need. I was amazed during the first snow storm I drove in. Styling is unique and eye catching, get use to alot of long stares as you drive by other cars. If you're considering a Lexus LS 430, any Lincoln, Infinity M45 or S class Mercedes, do yourself a favor, and test drive the 300C. You'll end up saving $15,000 or more."
chrysler,300,2005,fred, 10/11/2005,my last car 2006 hemi,4,luxury feel very fast on pick up. steers tight roomy yet it holds you in seat feels like a mercedes.       
chrysler,300,2005,01wht35, 11/17/2005,First Year Woes,4,"My 05 300 Sig Series is a good value overall.  It has enough power to put a smile on my face and it is confident in the turns.  I have had to make several trips to my local dealer for repair work.  A part of the interior of the sunroof broke and I have had a strange idle/near stall problem.  The idle problem took 3 trips to resolve.  Eventually a electronic module was replace on the 2nd trip and the computer was reprogrammed (dealer forgot to do so) on the 3rd trip.  I just noticed that, like others, my rear driver side window only works when it feels like it.  Since this is the first year of this car, I can overlook a few bugs (similar problems w/ previous Caddy and Aurora)"
chrysler,300,2005,FD, 12/25/2005,Not much luck,4,"We waited for our 300C to come in and then turned out to be very disappointed. After five times in the shop all for transmission related problems, they finally found the problem which took 10 days to fix.  After 30 days in the shop after only six months of ownership, it was time to say goodbye to this car.  "
chrysler,300,2005,chuck, 12/25/2005,my 300,4,I think that the 300 is the best car that chrysler has made in a long time. I'm a dodge man my self but chrysler makes them both so I can't say much. My wife and I love the car. You have to drive one then you will buy one.
chrysler,300,2005,M. Elizabeth Crum, 12/27/2005,Fun Car,4,Love the car.  Lots of compliments. Rear vision is limited and a problem.  Needs to have handles in roof of front rider's side.  very comfortable ride and big usable trunk. Great leg room in rear seat.
chrysler,300,2005,I am in LOVE, 01/03/2006,"Best $25,000 I have ever spent",4,"I upgraded from a '97 Accord so exterior design are amazing to me. I love the power (even without the Hemi). Drive is wonderful. Worried about RWD as I live in Colorado, but most the reviews have been reassuring. Have not had a visibility problem as others have noted. No mechanical or electrical problms yet."
chrysler,300,2005,audrey, 01/03/2006,"I Love My Chrysler 300 ""C""",5,"At the end of my work day, I look forward to my drive home.  The 300 ""C"" still turns people's heads.  The Hemi engine has plenty of ""punch"" when I need it. This car handles very well and my passengers are very comfortable. I love my ""Hands Free U-Connect"" which works off my Blue Tooth cell phone. All my calls are through my speakers; this was the first car in North America to have this feature. Makes me feel like I have alot of car..but alot of money still left in my bank account.  I'm completely satisfied with this car."
chrysler,300,2005,Thomas Alston, 01/03/2006,Design,4,"Front end is too low and scrapes underneath in parking lots where chocks are used.  Also, in parking areas near buildings where cement curbing and side walks exits. I dislike the gas tank.  I have spilled gasoline on several occasions.  Not much room to top tank off. I like the body style, the amount of interior and cargo space. Like the accessories."

chrysler,300,2005,300c Cruiser, 01/23/2006,wrong tires,4,"although this sedan has a very good amount of engineering, our chrysler buddies have failed temendously in utilising continental tires for this vehicle. if you are seriously considering the purchase of a new 300c, please, do not drive off the lot with one wearing these tires (continental). 15,000 miles into my new car and chrysler will not help me. they of course blame the tire manufacturer. the tire manufacturer will assis in pro-rating the tires but i know tht in another 15,000 miles i will need another set."
chrysler,300,2005,Edgar Smith, 02/04/2006,I'd buy another 330C,4,"Aside from the fact the Dealer wouldn't offer much of a price break, the car itself is well worth the $38,600 sticker price, infact it's a steal! The minor problems I've had with the car attributed to build quality were; wiper/turn signal stick was defective and the wipers would come on when using turn signals, and the wipers in the auto position. Front end camber was off and caused tire wear on edges of front tires. Transmission plug was lose, and caused a minor fluid leak.  "
chrysler,300,2005,CG, 02/07/2006,Best Car,5,"What a wonderful car.  I have every option except for navigation.  I have owned the 300 for 5 months now, and I haven't had any problems.  I've made a cross country trip with it and do lots of city driving.  It is the first car I've had that does both very well.  Also, it handles well in the mountains for being a large car, and the AWD has been great in the snow."
chrysler,300,2005,Gary Cook, 02/23/2006,300 C Hemi,4,"Order and purchased my 300C in June of 2004. Car is 19 months old and I have never had to take it back to the dealer for anything.  Diamler Chrysler quality assurance is shining.  Performance is super and is run to drive.  Highway gas mileage is great - I get 27mpg at 60 MPH, and 23 mpg at 75 MPH on a flat straight-away highway.  Front seats somewhat narrow for a big man."

I traded in my 1999 Cadillac Concours and truly enjoy the super looks and the handling and power of my 300C.  Our daughter bought a CHARGER with the HEMI in Dec. 2005 and she loves her DODGE!"
chrysler,300,2005,John O'Neil, 03/11/2006,Gator John's Chrsyler 300C,5,"I was caught up in the car's great looks and comfort and then sold my 2000 300M for the Silver 300C.  I have taken several road trips with this vehicle and got anywhere from 24-26 MPG depending on speed, around town it gets 19-21 MPG.  I have not had any problems with the car. The great looks of the car still turns people's heads.  I liked it so much, I bought another 300C  Jade Green for my wife 4 months after mine.  Our daughter just bought a 2006 CHARGER with a HEMI and loves its performance too.  Chrysler has truly found a winner here.  We actually saw 300C's while in Russia and Belarus last May 2005 and they turned heads there too!"
chrysler,300,2005,Ron H, 04/08/2006,Wife's Race Car,4,"This may be the wife's car, but I get it on weekends. Mannnn, this baby sure does fly. Although the Hemi can be a gas-eater, you can learn to adjust your driving style to hit 17mpg + in city driving, and 22 + on the freeway (CC @ 92). With CC @ 75, nets about 24.3 mpg. We love the car and it's every bit deserving of its Car of the Year Status. We were disappointed with Consumer Reports (Japanese Biased) rating on this vehicle. I'm over 6' tall and do not feel claustrophobic inside the spacious cabin. It does seat 5 large adults, comfortably. This vehicle is a modern day warrior which can easily run with the Muscle of the Late 60's and Early 70's, especially when you remove the speed limiter."

I'm getting the same vehicle with a few more options and AWD (I live in the Snowbelt). I've owned Cadillacs in the past and they don't have anything on the 300C. Tires were worn out at 44000, other than that, have had NO problems...never been in the shop but for routine maintenance. Gets 25 mpg on the interstate at 65mph. The fact that I'm buying another should say enough."
chrysler,300,2006,beniciajoe, 05/06/2015,Amazing vehicle,4,"I purchased a new Chrysler 300 Touring in Feb 2006, putting 120,000 miles on the vehicle in about four years. The only maintenance required was routine (oil changes, transmission flush, replacement spark plugs...). Amazingly, at 120,000 miles the car still had the original brake pads with 40% of the pad remaining. I've never had a vehicle this reliable, and have nothing but praise for Chrysler's build quality.
Ride was quiet and smooth, but also nicely balanced through the corners, making it as pleasurable on a back road as on the highway. I averaged slightly over 24 mpg on the highway at a steady 80 mph.
I later 'upgraded' to a 2010 300C, but found the Touring to be better balanced."
chrysler,300,2006,tigers4, 09/16/2014,232k miles and running - Great car,4,"Amazing quality and reliability for me.  No real issues until about 225k miles except replaced tie rods a couple times (partially due to crappy roads) and had one issue with it being stuck in park.  Never even replaced battery but I drive a lot of hwy miles.  
Since 225 k, I had the brake and rotors replaced (2nd time for rotor) and since then, the ABS and EAS lights have been on and as result lost cruse control.  Passenger door open from inside issues.  Power steering is a little stiff on occasion. Engine light is on.  Still drives fine though.  Body is in Great condition, one tiny spot of rust that just surfaced (live in Michigan) and a few scratches.  I got my moneys worth in this car!"
chrysler,300,2006,kcomstock, 04/11/2011,Disappointed,4,"The tires didn't last very long.
I hate the cruise control!
Very disappointed that my car worked great, and then stranded me. I find out that me along with 25,000k other owners have been stuck because car gets stuck in ""Park"" due to cheap plastic pin part not made from aluminum.
Chrysler won't do a recall.
I would like to know who to complain to.
It has cost me work time.
Very unexpected to have your car work perfectly then just not work at all.
I'm glad my college son did not take it as we discussed for his college admit day.
He would have been stuck hours away from home.
Chrysler wants to charge $500 for parts/labor for their mistake.
They keep this in stock because of so many!"

One owner black beauty only mod was a K&N drop in filter and I added a Borla exhaust system.
Hella fast and fun to drive. Well maintained and garage kept, used as a Livery sedan and purchased with about 93k miles. Replaced front strut assemblies and wheel bearings (pricey).
Car is nose heavy by design. All went well
without any issues until cruising in the fast lane at about 70mph Engine lost power without warning, barely made it off of freeway and car had died at the offramp. Stranded with clients in car 85 miles from home! Broken valve spring, bent valve and pushrod, Had heads redone and with tow bill about a $2500 breakdown. Sold it "

Drives really nice, suspension is a tad stiff for my liking but I live down a dirt road, performs great on the highway. The 3.5L engine has enough power to push the car without feeling sluggish, but the SRT-8 would be much more fun for a speed junkie such as myself. Love the way the engine sounds when put to the floor. Gets between 16-19MPG city and 25-27 MPG hwy."

Now it has 112k , and only problem I had was the EGR valve around 85k miles....I had to get it replaced and the problem is fixed. Its not the best luxury car nor has the best performance. But you get what you pay for and it does the work. My friend thinks that it is better than BMW 335 xDrive, for the long highway trips..you go figure...If you take care of your car it will not fail or break ...IMHO American made cars are more reliable than the European cars...plus the money you spend at the mechanic/dealer is always less if you go for the American...be smart if you don't have a million..."

The body style was the main reason for my purchase.
I take very good care of my cars.
I serviced this car regularly with oil changes every 3-6,000 miles even though the owners manual say to do so every 7,500 miles.
The 2.7 engine blew at 89,000 miles and now I have to go buy a new car.
It won't be a chrysler!
Other problems I had with this car was the transmission.
It seems that is a standard for Chrysler."
chrysler,300,2006,tmike3, 06/04/2010,Great Sport Sedan,4,Purchased with 56k miles. First car purchased in 22 years. Previously had SUVs and a pickup. This car is fantastic! Commute 60 miles per day and have had zero problems. The AWD is great! Had more snow than usual this winter and it handled great. The HEMI has more than enough power for this heavy car. Mileage is not bad on the highway. (20-22 mpg) Tons of room inside and in the truck.   
chrysler,300,2006,Daryl Buerger, 12/02/2006,Bang for the buck,4,This is the best full sized sedan in its price range. Look no further. I did exhaustive research and comparisons before buying. Almost went with the Charger but stuck with the 300C because a few more luxury features. This cars feel and roadability is outstanding. plenty of power and good fuel economy. I average 18 city and 22 hwy. with the MDS system The interior comfort is great with a ample rear seat room. This car still get lots of attention where ever it goes and it has the ability to get there fast. My 300 is loaded with every option Don't skimp here I've rented less equipped 300's and chargers only to love the one I have more! Not one disappointment yet. 
chrysler,300,2006,Pete V., 03/27/2018,Gonna' Miss my 300c!!!,5,"Sold mine to upgrade to a SUV.  LOVED the car, survived three accidents (none my fault, was rear-ended twice by teens texting), bulletproof engine and transmission, great looks, fantastic performance.

chrysler,300,2006,Scott Sowers, 04/16/2018,Surprised,4,"If you are looking for a really bad ass kick in the pants sleeper I'd suggest you get a 300 with at least the 5.7 hemi. Keep in mind that this is a very heavy car at 5300 pounds that will do 0 to 60 in around 6 seconds stock. Mine has 128,000 miles on. It and is still putting 298 hp of the 340 hp to the rear wheels. As for comfort and ride around 75 on the interstate and the 300C is as comfortable as sitting in your favorite recliner. Now I will say this as good as this car is there are a few things that you can be sure to address but it's mainly cosmedic. The exterior door handles are poor design and break easily (not cheap to replace). The PCM that is mounted to the fuse box under the hood gets hot and will go out (fixed by mounting an old computer fan to blow air directly on it). The fact stereo display will go out and is not easily replaced. Google it and check some of the forums and make your own decisions. I truly love my 2006 300C and would highly recommend it to anyone

It looks like a fabulous luxury car, and it truly is.  Don't be fooled.  It has that fabulous HEMI under the hood that wakes up the minute you summon it with a light touch of your right foot and transforms itself into a sports car with thoroughbred lineage.  It handles like a dream, brakes with little effort and has a throaty growl that only an American V-8 is capable of voicing.  This may be the most versatile vehicle I have ever experienced for many reasons.  I find myself taking ""the long way"" and inventing reasons to drive.  I love this car so much, I bought 2 identical!"
chrysler,300,2006,Jason, 07/02/2016,Love the car!! But has issues,3,"IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN BUYING A HEMI 300 READ THIS FULL REVIEW FOR THE TRUTH!! I read online about these cars before I bought mine, I found countless reviews about the 5.7 hemi completely failing at 100k miles, I thought I could avoid this if I was careful, so I went ahead and bought one, and the engine completely failed and needed a full rebuild at 145k, my machanic did it for 6k cash, I have had no trouble with the engine since other than the check engine light poping on and off all the time randomly for no reason (which is common with all 300s) the biggest problem with this car is the front end, all 300s have this problem, and there is no way around it. The entire front end is the most unreliable setup on earth, you can put 1500 into brand new bushings and control arms and a few weeks later it will start makeing noise again, I have owned mine for 5 months or so and my car is currently in the shop for front end repair for the 4th time! No matter what u replace, it's only going to fix the noise for a month or so, then you will hear a new noise, every single 300 owner I've talked to has had the same problem, one of my friends even had it happen a month after he bought his car brand new, it's simply part of the life of a 300 owner. The rear suspension is bad too, but not nearly as mutch as the front. I have never had this happen, but a few of my friends have had electrical problems with theirs causing the car to burn out its own battery, or even turn itself off in the middle of the road. I am yet to experience this with mine. The transmission in my 300c AWD has been pretty good to me, have only had one problem with it, I would be driving and pull up to a light and when I try to start again the transmission would rev up to high rpms and I would only crawl  forward at about 3 mph, so I had to restart the car in the middle of the intersection and it fixed its self, but then happen again 5 min later, and again and again, I brought it in and it ended up being a 10 dollar sensor, that was in the tranny instead of on top where it usually is on a car, so I had to send it in to a rebuild place which charged $850 for the job, no problems since, the tranny is different for the AWD cars, mine is still running strong at 148k miles, I hear the rwd  tranny fails at about 100k miles. The Chrysler 300c hemi AWD ( and rwd) is a mess when it comes to rely ability and  maintenance, but when it is running right it is the absolute nicest car I have driven or rode in, I get complements on the car every were I go, it looks fantastic, it sounds mean, it rides amazing, it shifts smooth, and you have endless power under your foot, its like driving a Mercedes with a bad ass American v8, It's mustang gt/camaro z28 speed in a car that is full sized,comfortable and weighs an extra 1000 lbs, plus with the AWD it's good in the snow, and actually handles really well, the suspension is firm for a normal car but it feels plush and expensive, the interior is very nice, actually really good quality materials, feels and looks very nice, this car is extremely unique, and there is nothing else on the market like it, I went with my heart and bought one ignoring all the bad reviews, and even though the  maintenance  is insane, it guzzles gas and has endless problems, I'm still glad I did. If u decide to buy one, u can get extra life out of your hemi by changing the oil every 3000 miles, using high octane fuel like 93 (I was using 87 when my engine failed) and investing in an oil catch can, to prevent oil build up inside the engine, which is commonly what cases the HEMIs to eventually fail.

chrysler,300,2006,JIm, 09/03/2008,Tranny Problems x4,3,"Since owning my 2006 300C AWD, I have had it to the dealers 4 times for a shifting problem with the tranny.  I can be driving along and with no warning whatsoever, the car acts as if it was put into neutral, engine is running strong, but it won't go anywhere. The dealer(s) (and Tech Support) seem to be having difficulties finding the problem.  I'm afraid to take long drives, just in case it happens again.  This makes the car not dependable or reliable at all !  Too bad because I really like it otherwise."
chrysler,300,2006,Mark, 12/09/2009,For a Blast Drive a 300C,5,"I purchased this car new in November of 2006.  It combines, power, handling and luxury all in one package.  After owning high end Lincolns, Oldsmobiles and Buicks, this auto is one of my favorites with exception to the Buick Park Avenue. The 300C AWD intertwines ample power, superb handling and amenities that gives the driver and passengers a superior auto experience. In three years of ownership there have only been two visits to the dealership and the problems were a tech bulletin notice for a transmission seal leak and the navigation CD failed. Both were handled with no residual problems. I plan on keeping this car for a long time, side by side with my Park Avenue!"
chrysler,300,2006,sdrolz, 12/24/2010,"Cool looking car, nothing but problems",3,"my 2006 300 Touring has been great and horrible at the same time.
unfortunately the horrible is starting to out weigh the good.
I bought it for it looks and power.
At purchase time, 79,000 miles, it was a friends corp fleet vehicle.You can't deny it is one of the coolest looking cars on the road today. The V6 power is great, but the transmission is a pain, shifting is horrible (automatic).
ESP works very well, sort of clunky in its responsiveness.
Mechanical issues: front end rattling that nobody can seem to fix or id, broken tie rod, brakes:caliper malf replacd evry 20k. worst of all electrical: entire heat/air controls work sporatically, and headlights flicker off at worst time."
chrysler,300,2006,Ralphy Perez, 11/22/2016,Mean Looking Ride!!!,5,"This is a wonderful car. The only thing that bugs me is the ""Klanky"" front end. I've replaced every bushing, control arm and various things to quiet this down but it has never ever been a problem. I did have to replace the transmission at 185000 but that is normal. Other than that, it has been one of my favorite cars and I'd drive it until it dies but my wife says it's got to go.
"
chrysler,300,2006,gl2238, 09/01/2014,Major Issues,1,"First problem was Stalling on left turns after tank fill up.
Problem was deteriorating valve in fuel tank letting raw fuel enter intake manifold.
Tank had to be replaced.
After tank replacement, car had to be turned over twice to start, unless cold start.
Clacking noise from air re circulation control? has been repaired twice, once by Chrysler.  It is clacking again and it can drive you crazy.
Park to Neutral lockout mechanism broke so car could not be driven.  Override also failed.
This also was taken care of by Chrysler as a courtesy.
Hood and trunk lifting struts have been replaced three times.
They only last 6 months in the Las Vegas Area (high temp environment).
Monroe's seem to last the longest.
I have had the hood come down on me a couple of times so now I use a stick.
My wife had to go to the emergency room when the trunk came down on her head.
Before 50,000 miles, Rack and pinion failed and water pump failed.  
I have been told by service that there cracks in some components of the front end?
We no longer can use the car on anything more than local driving.  
The whole car should have been recalled.
On wet roads the back end spins out with little force on accelerator,  especially on left turns????
Door handles brake free from hinge side.  Can be fixed with GOOP, but is an issue.
Car is only used locally as there has been a major issue with every prior trip.
Over the last couple of thousand miles the car has been riding like it has solid wheels with a lot of road noise.  Rides like a truck, obviously a suspension issue of some kind. 
Tires are inflated to rated pressure as noted on spec sheet by driver door.
No trade in value or resale so stuck with lemon.  A rotted one at that.

chrysler,300,2006,John, 09/08/2018,This Is What American Sedans Used To Be Like...,4,"I bought this car from a family member, who was the original owner. I'm a weird type of 21 yr old -old school- so I love big, RWD American sedans. The car was only serviced at the Chrysler dealership, which was a nice bonus. It had 78,000 miles on it when I got it, 81,000 today. Here are some thoughts on the car. First of all, the exterior design has aged very nicely and still can't be mistaken for anything but a 300. The lines are nice and muscular, and the front fascia is a classic, in my opinion. Performance-wise, the Touring trim level (as well as the Limited) makes use of the Chrysler 3.5 HO (high-output) V6 engine, which was the middle offering in the lineup - above the 2.7 DOHC V6 and below the 5.7 HEMI V8 and 6.1 HEMI V8. The engine strikes a nice balance between the fuel efficiency of the 2.7 V6 and the power of the 5.7 V8. With 250 h.p., the 3.5 is no slouch, and I find it to have above average acceleration for a car this size. It has the power when you need it, and the acceleration is almost V8-like. This engine is generally considered to be the most reliable of the offerings on the 2006 300, as the 2.7 is known for various sludging issues and being generally unreliable. Can't say I know too much about the 5.7 HEMI, but I've heard it isn't as good as the 3.5. The transmission is a 4-speed unit, and its merely adequate. I would have much preferred the 5-speed unit from Mercedes (as this car was built on a modified E-Class platform when Daimler, Mercedes' parent company, owned Chrysler), but the 4-speed is fine. And of course, the rear-wheel drive is awesome. This is how all big American sedans used to be set up. With RWD, the drive is so much more fun and engaging then FWD. The V6 has enough power to do some solid burnouts and get the car into a little slide around tight corners. Suspension-wise, the Touring trim is tuned for a more floaty feel, and I love it. Don't get me wrong, this is no Deville, but the ride is nice and comfortable. As good as the exterior and drivetrain are, the inside is a lacking. One plus is the room - there is plenty of it! It really is enourmous, with plenty of room for four adults, and five in a pinch. The seats on the Touring are listed as ""leather"" in the Edmunds specs, but they're actually a vinyl material. It's a nice, cheaper leather substitute, as they're very comfortable, feel very similar to leather, and are easier to clean and maintain. The seats themselves are really comfortable, especially the back ones. The Touring doesn't have heated seats as an option, unfortunately. The instrument cluster is clean and simple. There's a lot of storage space, which is nice, especially in the massive trunk (a 3-body unit, if I've ever seen one). The Touring also comes very well-equipped safety-wise, with anti-lock brakes, emergency stability program and traction control standard. There are a few complaints, however. First, visibility is pretty bad with the thin windows and high beltlines; add in a huge c-pillar, and you've got a one-way ticket to Blindspotville. The small windshield is also kind of annoying, as I am often leaning forward to see stoplights. Second, the interior, minus the seats, doesn't feel very luxurious. There's lots of cheap Dodge Charger black and grey plastics, and the buttons and radio controls are also taken straight from Dodge. Also, some pieces just feel cheap, like the plastic chrome piece that surrounds the shifter (the thing lifts right out). In general, it just feels sterile. I wish the interior was like the exterior, but then again, that's how these things were so affordable. Third, the cruise control system is just plain stupid. It's a weird design that has no indicator light on the instrument panel, so the only way you can tell that the cruise is on is a tiny, faint light on the control stalk, which is conveniently placed right behind the steering wheel. The
 result? You can't see it! Also, engaging it is not very intuitive. The whole system, which I found is directly sourced from Mercedes, is lacking. In reality, though, if the worst I can say about the car is poor visibility, a basic interior and a dumb cruise system, that's a high compliment overall. I love the car, and would highly recommend it for reliability (so far), drivability and personality!

*Update* 9/10/19: Unfortunately, the 300 was totaled in September 2018. In the time that I had it, I enjoyed it. Being a Chrysler product, electronic issues slowly accumulated (ABS, ESP, etc), and the repairs were costly. However, I was still generally pleased with the car, and enjoyed it. I replaced it with an '05 Cadillac Deville, and there is no question that the Caddy is the superior car. One year, zero issues, better build quality, more features, superior comfort. The 300 was a nice car with plenty of character, but I'd go 2005 Deville or 2006-2011 DTS, or a Town Car, if big American luxury is your thing, and you've got a sub-$7k budget.

chrysler,300,2006,Josh, 06/15/2016,Love this car!,5,"Very nice car. I've got 145,000 miles and it still looks new! The hemi is very responsive and has plenty of power when needed or just for fun. I get a lot of compliments and the design of the car is unique but not overstated. It is definitely made to drive swiftly on the highway but can still corner well for a vehicle that's as big as it is. With regular maintenance and minimal abuse this car will last a long time.

chrysler,300,2006,baconandeggs, 11/16/2012,"Unreliable, built to fail",3,"Do your research! People are giving star rating based on the looks/cosmetics of the car and not talking about the engine that will fail on you with low mileage! I've had the engine rebuilt and just recently, the transmission. The mechanic who rebuilt my engine makes a living on fixing Hemi V8 5.7L engines. He was surprised that mine lasted 110,000 miles. That should give you a clue as to what kind care and quality control Chrysler has. I bought the car brand new in 2006 and gave nothing but synthetic oil changes and the proper maintenance. It looks great but I do not recommend this vehicle for reliability purposes."

Braking will change your hair do, acceleration next to a so called sports car at a stoplight will have you smiling for miles while looking in the rear view.  Bad side, gas miles, brake dust, front spoiler is sooo low, I know I'm gonna break it sooner or later.  tranny is alittle rough from 1st to 2cnd. Small prices to pay for this much fun.

Then yhe transmission started acting up. In and out of the dealers. Finally they put in a new one, still isn't right tho. Waited weeks for the transmission, in the dealer more than out. Sad. So then, the tires wore out in about 16,000- 20,000 miles, kinda a tire recall, but I got stuck paying for them. Then at 30,000 miles on a trip a sensor goes out in Iowa. Never ending. Love the look but a Corvette is on it's way. Think twice before you fall in love with a 300! They have low resale and will empty your pockets! "

The salesman didn't offer for me to test drive the 3.5.  I'm worried about the transmission on a car that almosts weighs 4,000 lbs.  My 98 Ford Taurus had a better performance. Oh, well.

The V-6 engine has as much kick in passing as a typical V-8. It's moves when you need it too. It's a luxury car that I would recommend to anyone in the market to purchase a new car. Well worth every penny it costs.

Within 2 years of owning my 300 I have paid $700 to replace a housing unit $600 to replace the water pump $1700 to repair a crack head caused by the car running hot when the water pump went out. And now the car is stuck in park come to find out there are a lot of people having this same problem with Chrysler cars something about the shift box there is some plastic piece that is faulty and Chrysler will not do a recall leaving the customer to have to replace it. Will never ever buy another Chrysler car again. My father told me not to buy Chrysler but I did not listen.

I'm coming off of a 9 year relationship with a '98 Bonneville so I'm a little biased but this is NOT the best automobile I've ever owned.

And recently 2 quarts of oil just disappeared from the engine).It's a little hard to see traffic lights (I'm tall) but I still just like to walk out and look at it. The styling is just fantastic. I'll take pictures because it might be the last Chrysler I ever own."

chrysler,300,2006,Sue from Buffalo, 11/18/2005,300 warnings,1,"The driver's seat is imposssible to configure comfortably for a person of 5'6"".  The rear and front windows are very small. In the rear view mirror you can see both the roof of the car and the top of the back seat instead of the road. The car guzzles fuel and hates to accelerate or brake without PLENTY of warning. It plows through snow as long as there is no ice anywhere under or near it.  On ice under snow yesterday the dash showed a car with squiggly lines as it steadfastly refused to move until the eleventh steering wheel maneuver in oncoming traffic off a side street. Up until that moment, I could not understand the cars great width, which may be designed to absorb inevitable collisions."
chrysler,300,2006,cosmo5976, 08/24/2013,Awful to drive in the snow,3,"I have a 2006 300C I bought new in Nov of 05.
For the most part the car is a reasonable ok car.
Replaced a front strut and tires and that is about it so far. Car looks great with the Bentley grill and high speed feels like your floating on a cloud.
However, without a doubt this is the worse car I have ever driven in the snow.
Even with a light touch of the gas pedal reserving all this horsepower the car spins (including after I bought new high end tires for snow) and sways side to side.
In the past I have ventured out in the snow only to turn around because the security that I will be able to get home or get stuck is a constant on my mine.
Should have gone with the awd version."

Chrysler had a recall on this model but failed to inform me - only found out by chance when i brought in for oil change. one touch up feature works sporadically but after five trips to dealer it still isn't fixed properly. it is a shame i have to get rid of car for reliability reasons because i love the look of the vehicle.  interior features are plain looking and use of rubber-like products are a big mistake because they attract dust and are very difficult to clean."

At 60,000 miles I am just now replacing the tires.I have the large engine and it climbs the mountains at 80 and gets 26 to 27 mpg. For a full size car the mileage is great.

Had showroom new cars before, but this one is what I've been looking for all these years. Awesome styling inside and out. Room galore, great gauges, too many pluses to tell here. I don't want to put too many miles on the silver lady, but I cannot wait to get in and enjoy the experience! 3.5 L, 5 speed auto stick German tranny, loves to keep pulling on out to jail time speeds in city driving without even trying. Turns on a dime. Only car I ever wanted to keep til I'm dead and I'm a younger boomer. Pulled in to a major fast food rest stop on I-75, a guy comes up to me, says ""I thought for sure there was a Bentley pulling in, beautiful car"". 1 more look at bedtime-in love!"

The Mopar remote start does not work in cold weather and has been in for repairs 4 times. It is a great highway car and highway gas mileage averages 25.5 mpg. For a large V-8 Hemi this is very good. On winter roads, winter tires are a must have. People give compliments on this cars looks and the ""Cool Vanilla"" color. Width of the trunk is a little tight for 2 sets of golf clubs though. "

So, on long trips, I def tend to get a little stiff in the back and my leg hits the door and the door should have a little padding there.. Not hard plastic.  Its not a luxury vehicle, but its a solid,  dependable car for me so far.. Dealership cleared up a few issues that could have been costly, but they said it was a manufacturing error and fixed it all for 100 deductible even though I didn't extend the warranty.

Gas mileage on the highway (which is most of my driving) is 25 mpg to 28.6 mpg, which is fully loaded trunk and back seat @ 75 MPH. From Michigan to Florida and other parts of the country. The quality of gas really has alot to do with the mileage. I've tried them all. It's supposed to be run on mid grade, but that hasn't been the case either. Last time (feb & mar) just ran it on regular, and the mileage got better and better from the start of the trip to the end. ended with 28.6 mpg. One other thing is I run Synthetic oil. Has 27K"

Out-of- town dealer replaced all 16 valve springs and plugs. Runs fine now, but I could not believe the stares I got with my hood up and flasher lights blinking last Friday night on a major thoroughfare. I was shocked and disappointed that this could happen. I have never abused my 300C by driving it too hard. My car shook violently and I lost power rapidly. The check engine light flashed unmercifully. I will give my hemi one more chance. The next time I am trading for either a Japanese or German car. I guess American built reliability is still highly suspect."

With the engine, in my opinion, too small, 2.7 V6. Fuel economy is not as advertised, and the transmission leaves a lot to be desired. I like to use 2 nd. Gear a lot in winter. This can not be be done on this car. Otherwise it is a lot of car for the money. Hope chrysler changes that poor winter time transmission though. If i had noticed a little earlier, i may have had second thoughts on that issue. All in all, it is a very nice car."

I have the touring model, so there are a few little extras that i would like, but i can live w/o them.  And for being only a 3.5 L V6 its got plenty of power.

The fire started in the engine compartment and although I am no expert - the fire started exactly where the fire described in the recall would have been.  The SURPRISE was the fire in the trunk.  The fire under the hood must have shorted out some wires and caused the battery (in trunk) wires to melt to the point it caught the carpet in the trunk on fire and there was a pretty big fire next to the gas tank. Thats when I discover there was NO WAY to open the trunk - ALL ELECTRICAL was out. Chrysler is a disappointment in handling my problem. Been very happy with the car until this fire
chrysler,300,2006,villanpd, 02/21/2007,AWD version sits higher,4,"AWD version which I have sits an inch or so higher than the other variants.  I like the height as most SUVs do not block my view as they do in a lower sitting vehicle like a sebring (which I also have).  The car is nimble for its size, corners well, and gives a great ride. Apparently, the 300 is blessed with the Mercedes Benz suspension system for a fraction of a Benz price. It also has the Benz designed transmission which is smooth and is able to be shifted manually into higher-lower gears.  Nice touch that adds to the secure AWD ride on mountain roads.  The exterior is great and everyone knows it.  It gets lots of looks.  The interior is not as impressive as you might expect, but suitable"

The color is Cool Vanilla outside with cream leather interior and I get so many looks on the road. Honestly, it is the nicest one I have seen so far. A real eye stopper.

After 2 years, we still think it looks great and love driving it. We considered a midsize but, in hindsight, the larger car was the right choice, especially with two boys 12 & 15. The 3.5 L engine provides plenty of power. I was concerned about getting rear wheel drive but the traction control performed magnificently in the Colorado snow, and it was snowy, this past Christmas.

ZERO issues with engine or transmission. A friend told me who has families that work at a Flint auto plant that once you break the seal to the transmission that will cause problems, crazy but absolutely true. One comment on here with issues getting car out of park , true , early on I had that bad pink plastic piece in shifter area go bad (bad design)  I read reviews and ordered a new metal piece from billet , Very easy repair. I also have replaced Plugs and coils. I was very hesitant on a Chrysler but I think because Domlar owned them at the time quality jumped ,this is a very solid car.
It’s to the point now I’m gonna see how far this car goes until it blows up. I was so impressed when it turned over 300,000 miles I called Chrysler corporate , might have gotten ahold of the wrong person or they just don’t care about feedback but they seemed so disinterested in me wanting to offer my success story and commenting that they should continue to manufacture cars the way they did my model.
It now has 336,000+ miles I run it up and down a mountain weekly 300+ miles per week. I also rent new cars weekly and very impressed with the new ones but with different ownership then when I purchased mine are they as good as the one I have?

Now has 341,000 miles , no issues. I guess the reason Chrysler USA corporate has zero interest in me letting them know what a great car it is is because they’re owned by Fiat."

I drove to the store fine and when I came out the car failed to start. I had it towed to the nearest dealership where the mechanic confirmed that that engine is completely gone. The pistons have holes in them and the valves are in pieces, it will cost $8,100.00 for a new engine.

I also wanted something with low miles and didn't want to pay much over $20K. With all that in mind, the 300C AWD was pretty much the only option. I originally wanted a 2007, but found a nice 2006 with only 21K miles in my price range.  The car is AMAZING. The ride quality is great, the look is great, the handling is great and the power from the 5.7 L Hemi is jaw-dropping. I had had to make one minor repair -- the sway bar bushings needed to be replaced because they were worn and causing a clunking sound over rough pavement, but otherwise it's a total dream!"

While I don't wale on it like my chipped 98 Neon its just as much fun and 10 times more comfortable.  It hauls 5 six footers to lunch in comfort and has become the ride of choice for my co workers.  Around town, despite my aggressive use of the throttle it gets 19 mpg or better and 27 on the highway.  When ethanol free fuel is available it knocks down 30 mpg.  I base these claims not on the readouts but on an old fashioned record book.  This 300 Limited is the most value I have ever received in a car purchase.  "

This car is so fast and fun to drive. It has more horsepower than just about anything on the road. It handles like a race car and accelerates like on too. I bought this car because it was the only 4 door on the dealer's lot with a DVD in it for my 3 year old daughter. She was driving me crazy on road trips.. Little did I know what exactly I had just done. I just purchased the best car for the value on the market today.

I'm a dragracer, been doing it for 8yrs, and I must say, this car will pin you back in the seat, hard. No matter what speed you floor it at!!
Within the 4mo, of owner ship; I only had two problems. 1) Sometimes the AC would start acting funny & not run properly. 2) Once or twice it wouldn't start on the first try, but would on the second try.
Other than, I 100000% recommend this car, to ANYBODY. It's a blast to drive!"
chrysler,300,2006,Gailya Thomas, 01/08/2008,I am Impressed,4,"I have had my Chrysler 300C for over 2 years now and I still love it. I test drove the base, touring, and limited models and I was not impressed and was not considering purchasing the car until I drove the C, even though the cost was much higher.  It handles extremely well and the power to move when it has to is fantastic, especially on the freeway. The only problem I have had is a problem with the brakes squeaking, which the dealer took care of.  "
chrysler,300,2006,LOU, 07/16/2005,Chrysler's come back !!!!!!!,5,The only flaw is the air condition unit is weak! Other then that this is perfect car!
chrysler,300,2006,gregory tortorello, 04/23/2007,"Looks awesome, in shop often",4,"This is best looking car I`ve ever owned. I was blown away by the stylings of the 300. Unfortunately it has been in the shop over a dozen times with one problem alone clocking 6 visits without the problem being rectified. Needless to say, I`ve given up on this model and probably all Chrysler products as well."
chrysler,300,2006,Valarie Brown, 09/22/2006,Loved every mile--40K and driving,5,"After having driven both a Mitusbishi Eclipse and four wheel drive SUVs, the handling on the 300 has been a surprise and joy.  I love driving on the open road and my 300 made the 150 mile daily commute comfortable.  I purchased the car with all of the bells and whstles and have not regretted any of the additional expenses.  I am now a life time subscriber to satellite radio and a faithful user of the integrated bluetooth phone system. "
chrysler,300,2006,300 owner, 02/26/2009,Performance after 75000,3,"This vehicle did a lot of highway driving and was great up to 75000 mls, afterwhich started having problems with head gasket, water pump and thermostat which were all related to the heating system, very costly and after speaking with several Chrysler professionals it is to be expected with this 2.7 engine the problems and more not described here. I've met technicians that would not touch this engine. For one thing the water pump is behind the timing chain which becomes faulty because of the head gasket issue, resulting in high labor costs. Really liked the vehicle but dont have time to spend at the dealership spending money in these hard times."
chrysler,300,2006,Don O, 08/28/2010,SRT8,4,"The car has been awesome! I bought w/12k Miles and the Car stock was very fast w/425 Hsp. With few bolt on modes the car is close to 500. A whole group of dedicated followers are on-line waiting to share info. Parts are very reasonable. Gas Mileage is where you would expect, drive like your in the Indy 500 and you'll get 13 MPG, baby it and it's 18. Every time you start your SRT8 a Prius cries. Very tight ride, good handling for a 4200 lbs car with plenty of peddle. You can turbo your ride and have more power than a Lambo but why it has more tha enough. Exhaust makes the car sound like a Beast! SRT8 is a total sleeper and is the most bang for your buck you can possible get!"
chrysler,300,2006,B. Parnell, 05/27/2005,Returning to the Past,5,"I bought a '99 300M because in 1956 a 300 blew me away in Okla City -- I was driving a '55 Chev with a big engine and lots of toys. I liked the '99 300M, but didn't like the front wheel drive. Chrysler fixed this for me in the new 300. I have a 2006 and love everything the great designers and engineers did. Great Car.  PS I also bought the wife a new PT Cruiser -- another great car."
chrysler,300,2006,Pokey50, 12/24/2005,Pokey's 300c Experience,3,"At first glance I love the 300c. Brought the car without a test drive. Love all the attention of driving it. In my third month of owning it, the car began to shudder while accelerating. Took it back to the dealer and learn that there is a technical service bulletin on this car because water is getting in the transmission by way of a faulty dip stick tube on the transmission. The dealer first change the filter and fluid, work for a while, then shudder came back. The dealer replace rhe torque converter as well as change the fluid again. Waiting to see if this solves the problem. I love the way this car looks, the power and feel although the ride is a bit bumpy in the  inner  city. Full warranty."
chrysler,300,2006,Bryan Kalinpolus, 01/24/2006,SSSSWEEET,4,I just turned 17 and ive been recently looking at the corvtee and a saleen mustang s281 supercharge. One day i was lookin at 300c and i became interested and love eveything about it and one i found out it came in srt-8 i bought it. LOVE IT! i got black on black and tinted the crap outta the windows when u pull up at a late noone expects u to blast them and leave in the dust. I torched and m3 last week the guy was aaskkn so many questions about the srt-8 i told it was stock
chrysler,300,2006,Jack Ford, 02/25/2006,Better than expected,5,"Chrysler's 300C SRT8 turns out to be better than my expectations.  The MPG for such a powerful car is much better than I expected.  The sport suspension is more comfortable than I expected, especially seeing on TV all of the extreme driving that it can do.  This car gets as much attention as my custom Harley Road King.  The slightl lower stance and the 20"" 10 spoke wheels are very impressive.  My wife thoroughly enjoy's driving the SRT8.  She has claimed this car as hers.  Today when we got onto the freeway, and there was a long open space, I stepped on the gas for about 3 seconds.  We both looked at each other, and have not stopped smiling yet. Go; buy one now!"
chrysler,300,2006,Big Dave, 04/20/2006,Fun Fun!,4,"This car is a blast -- A sports car in disguise that can blow away most sports cars on the road.  I bought it with all the options and now have 5,000 miles on it.  No problems. 17 mpg average, which is better than I was expecting.  Turn off the ESP and spin the wheels!  The power, performance, and braking is excellent for a large sedan.  The auto stick is fun.  Very solid feel at over 150 mph.  This car makes the drive to work or play very enjoyable.  I call it the Bat-mobile.  All it needs is body armor when you lock it, cables, an oil slick, and rockets."
chrysler,300,2006,Perry Southard, 05/20/2006,Perrys SRT8,4,"Chrysler did their homework with this car. As soon as you sit in the leather and suede seats you are hugged by the side bolsters which hold you in place when you step on the gas. This car has all the power you need to have plenty of fun with. The cockpit is very quiet and well trimmed out. I have purchased many cars in my day,and I would have to say that this is one of th best large size sedans on the market no matter what the price."
chrysler,300,2006,MWD, 08/09/2005,Suprisingly Solid and Fun,4,"I have owned my 2006 300c for about a month now. Initially on a trip to Las Vegas, while driving around town the car had some fairly serious issues that turned out to be a faulty fuel sending unit. The dealership fixed the car quickly and other than that, it has been an awesome car. Very quick and solid and plenty of fun to drive. Around town fuel economy is about 14-15 and on the freeway I get a suprisingly good for a car this powerful, 23-24mpg. In my opinion nothing can beat this car when it comes to bang for the buck. It is a great value and well worth every penny."
chrysler,300,2006,Bob G, 12/20/2006,300C AWD less than perfect!,4,"Vehicle is very comfortable, handles well, ease of entry and exit is very good. Present mileage is 9500. I have experienced throttle hesitation under most circumstances but especially when turning from highway onto exit and attempting light acceleration, it simple does not respond until accelerator is depressed much more and then response is sudden and abrupt. Under full throttle acceleration I frequently experience a severe hesitation between shifts from 1st to 2nd wherein the vehicle seems to loose forward momentum and nose dives! Dealer says ""no codes, no problem"" I am extremely disappointed in this vehicle due to the aforementioned behavior. My Wife has experienced the same behavior.   "

I owned a 300c for several yrs and was more that happy with it, until a drunk driver totaled it. I was Devastated until I found my SRT8.. HANDS DOWN THE  MOST AMAZING, POWERFUL, CLASSY, HEAD TURNING CAR I HAVE EVER OWNED!!! The only minor drawbacks for me -
1.More $$ for premium gas, and less mileage 
2.More $$ for full synthetic oil changes
3.Wear and tare on tires , requiring new tires every 17,000mi .

Small price to pay for such an amazing sports/luxury BEAST!!!!

chrysler,300,2006,300C 4 dr sedan, 06/05/2005,Drive as usual for l00 Miles,3,"We have found at least a dozen features about this car that we do not like, 700 words is not enough to tell the entire story, a quick summary is no front seat assist handles, backs of legs rub on side of car when getting out.  Daytime glare on dash instruments, buttons that operate radio, navigation etc. are not illuminated at night.  Demo ride did not point out that highbeam headlights were obtained by pushing down on the lever not by lifting up the lever as with prior Chrysler cars.  The feature that bothered me most however was the lack of comfortable armrests for the driver, I was spoiled by the captains chairs in my van.  I was not told about the cost of the puncture proof tires either."

chrysler,300,2006,Mr. Dissappointed, 03/22/2008,An Ominous Voice,2,"Where do I begin? I bought the car in 2006, and rarely drive it. It has only 8000 miles of driving at this time. The gravel shield has fallen off - protected under the warranty. Now the Front End Bumper has completely fallen off as a result of the low to the ground design, when parking in stalls and approaching the parking stop. I have to pay $2600 to have it fix. I blame myself-for trying to spur the US Economy and not following my orig. feelings of buying a Non US vehicle. I would like to sell it - but have about 6k invested in after market products and services. I like the style of the car and the okay with the interior comfort. I will be getting rid of it this coming year. What a waste?"
chrysler,300,2006,tony, 06/06/2008,love it!,4,"LOVE my Car! This is my second 300, had the old model and drove it for 6 yrs before buying the newer model. This car is one of the best cars i have ever owned, looks, style and fantastic ride. My friends are envious."
chrysler,300,2006,budman, 06/11/2008,Best Car I have ever owned,4,I love this car! I have had it about a month and taken it on several trips. It drives great and gets over 24 MPG out on the highway. 
chrysler,300,2006,PAR, 07/21/2008,Nice!,4,"Overall a fantastic touring vehicle with all the amenities one could ask for! Very comfortable, safe and also powerful when necessary. I would highly recommend this vehicle for anyone who loves to travel in comfort. If anything, definitely get these 2 options offered..(U-connect, Protection group), these 2 options seemed to make the 300C an effortless luxury. And the MP3 capable CD player was also a huge plus!"

And I have achieved over 26 mpg on the highway cruising at 70+ miles per hour. Spacious with power to spare - and it still gets compliments everywhere I go. The only drawback is interior could have been done a little better. When I my lease is up I'll probably buy this or get a new one!!!"
chrysler,300,2006,jamesdtuttle, 08/31/2008,You Gotta Have This Car,4,"I purchased a 2006 300C SRT8 from Carmax and am VERY pleased. The SRT8 has great luxury features (I compare to my Lincoln Town Car) and has superior features to the other 300s.  The handling is superb, brakes are unreal, and the 6.1 hemi is the ultimate. An American muscle car V8 to the max. It has incredible throttle response, awe-inspiring power, and a delicious muscle car sound. Sedate and well mannered, it nevertheless will pull like a freight train heading into a black hole when you put your foot in it.  Downsides? Compared to my Town Car, it's noisy. Gas mileage ain't in the stratosphere.  Plusses? It sticks to the road like glue, has every luxury feature known to man, & HEMI!"
chrysler,300,2006,scropionmanager, 10/18/2008,Bad Transmission,3,"I am was very excited about my 300 but that excitement has diminished.  My car has been to the dealership 5 times since July, the first four times was because of fuel problems and I was told to but a higher octane gas, still had problems until the 4th time when I had to have the throttle body decarbonized because of the poor advice from the 1st visit. Now the transmission needs to be replaced because it was low on transmission fluid for too long.  Note you can not check check the fluid the dealership has to this.  My question is why wasn't this check the 1st four times I went in.  The warranty is gone and now I need to spend $2900 in addition to the $700 already spent in a 2 yr old car.  "
chrysler,300,2006,Dennis Charles, 12/25/2007,The Good and the Bad,4,"Like the Hemi power and the smooth transmission. Do not like the rattles. I have a very bad dash rattle, drivers side that I can't seem to get rid of. The sunroof shade rattles if it is open. Also have several electrical gremlims. Auto up window sometimes does not work, rear window would not work one time, auto locks did not lock."
chrysler,300,2006,Beedle of VA BCH, 11/27/2008,Unbelievable Value and Reliablity,4,Excellent value for the money. Bought this car 12/05 and have over 33000 miles on it. Excellent reliability. Absolutely no problems. Ride is even better since Conti's replaced with Goodyear tires. The 300C compares favorably with my wife's new 2008 Cadillac STS.
chrysler,300,2006,Hemi Girl, 12/10/2008,My Hemi Is Bigger Than My Husbands,5,"I'm parting ways with my SRT8 after almost 2 years. My employer is putting us back in company cars. It has been the most enjoyable car I have ever owned. From the day I drove it home I got thumbs up signs from drivers on the highway, people still walk over to talk about it when I'm gassing it up, I've owned Mercedes E class, Audi A6's and various other not so exotic cars but this car has been the best. I average 18 around town, get 21-22 on the hwy, never had a mechanical issue, original brakes, only second set of tires, we live in Minnesota and the traction/stability system kept us on track in the worst weather. Love the U Connect, the Navi, I have had some tickets too, its fast!"
chrysler,300,2006,Brad, 12/18/2008,Awesome Vehicle,4,This vehicle has awesome looks while it is a great car for the money. The Hemi is a great. The features of the car are great too. I get compliments daily on the car.  
chrysler,300,2006,AndreaR, 12/23/2008,Great Car,4,I have had this car for almost 3 years now. My lease is almost up and overall have loved this car. I live in Minnesota so I wouldn't say it's a car I would choose again to take on the Minnesota winter but it held up! I had the electronic stability program which did not come optional in the base sedan and it helps out a lot. I believe I had two recalls and then also one time everything that was power operated other than the locks went out and had to get the entire dash replaced. It was covered under warranty so it didn't matter much. Other than I loved it! Gas mileage is decent for the size of the vehicle but it helps with the smaller engine. 
chrysler,300,2006,300m, 01/01/2009,Watch Out,3,"The 300 is a very pretty car to look at but, if you want a car that will stand up in performance and, reliabilty I wouldn't advise you to get a 300. I've had my car almost two years, I get my regular services however my car sounds and performs terrible. The transmission do not change smoothly and, its extremly loud. My tire went flat and, I was told I have a slow leak in the rim that can't be fixed which mean I have to buy a new rim at $400. If you have a choice please do not get a 300."
chrysler,300,2006,Aggrivated in Ky, 02/16/2009,I loved it one time too!,3,"I've owned my 300 for exactly a year now. I agree with others it looks fantastic. Granted I bought it used, but The car idles rough, shifts badly, currently need sway bars, wheel bearings, EGR Valve system repair. It sways badly lags in power especially in take off. I have check engine light and 2 lights to do with breaking illuminated. And beware if you ever have a flat tire. The lug nuts have casings on them that go over the lip of lug nut. They are not the removable caps. When you try to take the lug nuts off they caps just spin. I have had to cut the caps off my lug nuts and have to buy all new. On top of that, whoever heard of a car you have to have software updates? Wish I never bought it!"
chrysler,300,2006,gking1985, 04/01/2009,best of both worlds,4,"Essentially the best vehicle I have ever owned.  Combines the exhilaration, acceleration, and precision I expect from my Jaguar, and the quiet, luxurious, and smooth attributes I get from my Lexus Hybrid.  I'm a believer in domestic cars again - you will NEVER feel underpowered at a stoplight, or an on-ramp.  The Benz-derived tranny is a perfect mate to the ""demi-HEMI"" and shifts smoothly without hesitation. There should be no question about engine performance - RWD's performance off the line is jaw dropping (in dry conditions of course).  If you want a car you can schmooze the boss in, and blow past the European imports in, look no further.  "
chrysler,300,2006,Greg, 05/16/2009,A true performance sedan,4,The Chrysler 300 SRT 8 takes performance too a whole new level.

chrysler,300,2006,southshore4, 08/25/2009,Awesome sedan,4,"I love my C and the Hemi engine.  Roomy and comfortable.  Great leg room for 6'2"" and then some.  I also drove an M for years, which had superior handling to the C.  Reliability has been very good.  Had worn tie rods at 30K, but Chrysler reimbursed for parts at least following my complaint letter.  All components work great on this vehicle.  I'll average 21 mpg in my 20 mile commute, not bad knowing that this car has unbelievable acceleration when needed/wanted."
chrysler,300,2006,Dave, 09/15/2009,Satisfied,4,"At 41000 miles, I give Chrysler the thumbs up for this one.  This car has been fun to drive.  The tires don't last long but that is a result of the tire melting 425 hp.  The brakes also make this car great.  The brembos really bring this heavy car to a halt.  Overall a great vehicle."
chrysler,300,2006,dana denny, 02/02/2008,2006 300c srt8,4,Good interstate driver. Like the handling on secondary roads. Good cornering. Car feels balanced but I know that the car is front end heavy. Power when I need it but the nav system will get you lost. Left rear power window quit working.

The engine cut off on me twice, I took it in for transmission work once, and its horrible in snow! Each time it snows I'm stuck! Im getting rid of this ASAP!"
chrysler,300,2006,johnny strat, 02/08/2008,300 SRT8,3,"Fun to drive, but in the month I've owned its been in for service twice. Brakes made horrible noise, took it in and was told there was a service notice re the brakes. Pads were replaced under warranty. One week later, same problem. Took the car in again and was told that chrysler wouldn't do anything about the problem and I'd have to live with it. Ashtray has also broken twice. Driver window auto-up has to be fixed. Splash guard under the front spoiler fell off on the highway and Chrysler wouldn't replace under warranty because I didn't stop the car on the interstate and go back to pick up the pieces after they fell off."
chrysler,300,2006,James Percel, 02/11/2008,300 srt 8 Chrysler,4,I watched the car from development stages and new that I wanted one as soon as they became available.  The car drives very well and gets good gas milage for a 6.1 liter engine producing 425 HP
chrysler,300,2006,denny5, 02/12/2008,Good interstate cruiser,4,"This car turns heads, looks real good on the outside but it could use some help on the inside. The shiny stuff on the steering wheel could be replaced by cruise contol buttons. Handles are ok on a truck but not on this classy car."
chrysler,300,2006,Rich, 04/30/2005,my c,4,"My 300c has plenty of reserve power, and great looks, but the transmission lags as does its ability to corner tight. All in all if your a patient driver, you'll love this baby. The ride needs to be smoother over bumps."
chrysler,300,2006,Doc, 05/16/2005,Hits & Misses,4,"Overall, a great, full to drive and true head turner. The Hemi gives the car plenty of get up and go, acceleration is outstanding and responsive.  Plenty of interior room, well laid out instrumentation. Seating needs more bolstering, better designed buckets to keep you from sliding, better interior noise dampening to provider a quieter ride and reduce wind and road noises.  The vehicle appearance demands attention and gets you notice on the road. Longer seat bottoms are needed for tall driver, or seat extension.  Car provides great leg room. I am over 6 feet and this cars allows me to adjust my seat all the way back and still have room to get in the back seat and be comfort. Great car."
chrysler,300,2006,So-Cal Lee, 05/27/2005,Best Car I've Owned,4,"I bought a 2005 300-C.  The dealer loaded it up with everything plus some of their own add-ons to boost their profit.  That bothered me.  Everything else is better than I expected.  I still have my 300M but this is a totally different experience.  This is without a doubt the nicest car I've owned. Get compliments all the time. Ride is smooth, quiet and I feel the car is firmly on the road at any speed.  Have driven in mountains and handling is great.  Complaints:  Paint quality needs improvement.  I have ""Orange Peel"", rear view mirrow blocks visibility while turning right. Car has tendency to track to right or left with slightest crown in roadway"
chrysler,300,2006,Doc, 06/01/2005,Fun Drive: Great Road Trip Vehicle,4,"First road trip was a blast from the city to the country.  Vehicle handled the interstate with ease, providing a comfortable drive over the hills and winding roads.  Very capable for passing and handles well.  Vehicle cabin was roomy and made for a comfortable driver and passenger ride. Full economy did not fully meet expectations.  However, did drive the recommended speed limit.  Overall average was 18mpg.  Never noticed when or if the engine went from 8 to 4 cylinder operation. The trunk proved to be roomy enough to handle all the luggage for three people. Over the course of a 500 trip, grew to love the performance and handling of the vehicle. Missed the upscale luxury interiors."
chrysler,300,2006,wiskydelta, 06/02/2005,I'm thrilled with it,5,"This car is super fast, I've had it up to 135 and I've been told the govner kicks in at 155. It's also smooth and quiet to drive. Mine is a 2005, they will come down on a 05 but they want full sticker price on a 06, I paid $300 over invoice. This is also my first non-GM vehicle."
chrysler,300,2006,hickory, 06/09/2005,We Love Our Hemi!,5,"We've only had the car for 12 days,and can't say enough good things about it.  It's whisper-quiet, smooth over the bumps, has great amenities, and it looks great!  Gas mileage has been in the low 20's, including time sitting in the driveway reading the manual & figuring out the gadgets.  The navigation system is light-years better than our 2004 Town & Country (guess we need to update our disc for it).  Love the EVIC with its multitude of informative screens and its easy-to- set ""personal settings"" option.  Rain-sensing windshield wipers are excellent (a feature we've never had before); roomy trunk is terrific; all the ""toys"" are lots of fun (and helpful).  Can't beat the Hemi!"
chrysler,300,2006,Rob, 06/09/2005,"Nice car, needs a few refinements.",4,"Finally, got my 300C. Excluding back seat DVD and Sirius (n/a in Canada), it is fully loaded. It's been fun 3 days. Plenty of power. Effortlessly accelerating and passing other cars. Quiet. I owned 2 300Ms and moved to 300C thanks to Chrysler's pull forward program or it would be another 6 months in 300M. I also shopped BMW 5 series, but did not want to pay extra and wait another 6 month in the old  car. Attractive design, but car feels a little bit bulky in the front (especially when cornering) as I can see hood's corners. I had no problems with visibility, but it takes a bit to get used to boxy design when parking. Shows 14l/100km mostly highway driving. Hoped for less, but no complaints."

chrysler,300,2006,Jim Jones, 06/11/2005,E55amg substitute,4,Outstanding muscle car performance in a beautiful and sophisticate 4 dr sedan package with all the creature comforts for under $50K!  It does not get any better and you save at least $30K over what the E55AMG would set you back. So it takes premium and gets about 12 mpg in town.  Not a great price to pay for so much fun.

I'm a big man and this car with it's telecoping wheel, variable pedals, and power seat, gives all the room I need for comfort and access to all the controls........ The fit and finish is one of the best for a NA built car.....I would like this car more if I could have gotten the hemi, but price and insurnce was was factor. All in all, one of the best I have owned and driven. I gave up a great Ford Crown Vic to drive one of the best! And the styling sure makes a statement! "
chrysler,300,2006,Bobay, 06/14/2005,"Great car, if only frony end was better",4,"After having the car for only a week, I noticed that it was pulling to the right after two visits to the dealer for repairs, all they really did was over inflate the front tires. Now I guess my tire warrenty will be voited for improper ware.  "
chrysler,300,2006,Rocco , 06/14/2005,300 C,5,"A few things could have been better, But then again, every car has some flaws. I found it vey difficiult to adjust the rear view mirror. I can't grip it good to move it. Bling spots all over. And limited view through the front window, cant see traffic light good, i find myself looking at the walk way lights to determine if the light changed green. But over all , i love it.!!!!!"
chrysler,300,2006,Glen McMahon, 06/26/2005,"If you don't have one, get one.",5,"I have had my 2005 300C (Black) since the middle of Feb 2005 and have almost 10K miles on it. I have thoroughly enjoyed everyone of them. The reason I bought it was because of it's uniqueness and the price. No matter where I go, usually someone will come up to me and want to see and talk about my ride. I continually get compliments on this car. It is a blast to drive. I have not had one single problem with it since I bought it. If you are looking for a luxury sports car sedan this vehicle covers all three.  "
chrysler,300,2006,2006 300C, 07/10/2005,300C for Me,4,"The new 300 body style is distinctive and dramatic. The unique appearing exterior is teamed up with a clean and user friendly interior. The 5.7L HEMI V8 with its 340 horsepower must be experienced to be really appreciated. Chrysler has put the fun into driving again, long absent in an American automobile."
chrysler,300,2006,Michele, 07/21/2005,"Great ride, super lines!",4,"This is an awesome car, even with the V6 it still  has quite a bit of get up and go. The ride is super quiet, the looks are GREAT! Beautiful car - and my son with is carseat fits with with lots of leg room! And good gas mileage for such a big car. "
chrysler,300,2006,cota, 07/21/2005,Great Car,4,"Had the car for two weeks and am having a blast. Drives great and feels great. The only downfall is the mileage, but what do you expect with this size of engine. When parking, you have to be careful not to hit the front due to the bumper being low. You will get better at backing in thats for sure =). Definitely worth the wait to get this car. Oh, and my 16 year old son is loving it too. I do wish the wheels were shiney."
chrysler,300,2006,Steve S, 07/21/2005,A Really Great Car,4,I have had my new 300 Touring for about 2 months and have racked up almost 4000 miles in that time.  I find myself looking for excuses to go out and drive.  I started my search for a new car by looking for coupes in the GM family and after a month of web searching and comparing both coupes and sedans I could not find a better dollar for dollar value than the 300 and nothing came even close as far as making a statement.
chrysler,300,2006,Chele, 07/22/2005,I am so happy with my '06 300C,4,"This vehicle has great handling, a smooth ride, classy exterior and a luxury interior.  It is definitely a head turner.  The outside noise is reduced to such a level that even with the Boston Acoustic Speakers turned down very low you still can't really hear any outside noise.  It's almost scary! And the power.  Whew!!! This car has so much power that it's not for the squeamish."
chrysler,300,2006,FRED E., 08/17/2005,A great fun finally,5,"This is a great new car, comfortable fast and quick manuevering, the thing that I admire the most is the fact that I'm getting about 30 miles per gallon in the city and highway mileage, I get nothing but compliments when I drive my customers as I own a Limousine service in Los Angeles,Ca. I've accumulated almost 2000 miles in my first month of ownership, hopefully I will enjoy this car much more than my Towncar the car itself in paying off in the comsumption of gasoline, I literally paying half of my cost as I did a month ago, the extended chassis makes a truly enjoyable and smooth ride."
chrysler,300,2006,Bill Lyons, 08/27/2005,Fun and Luxury,4,A very good looking car. Lots of looks and positive comments from those who see it and ride in it. Plenty of bells and whistles for the money. A good value. Plenty of room for the driver and three passangers. Large trunk for traveling.
chrysler,300,2006,Wayne Merris, 09/09/2005,300c,4,"This is a great car very powerful. So far the gas  mileage is not as good as i expected but i guess it would be if i drove the car decent, but who can drive a car like this decent. Rear view mirror hard to adjust."
chrysler,300,2006,BJ, 09/14/2005,Different from the rest!,5,I have owned this great car for 3 months. At first I had some concern about gas mileage and figured I had bought power and it would cost me. REcent 600 mile trip with AC on and Interstate travel at 65-75 mph averaged 23 mpg which included about 2 hours of city driving. 100% interstate yields about 25 mpg. Fun to drive and it gets the looks and thumbs up!
chrysler,300,2006,wayne&peggyjenkins, 09/14/2005,pleasing to own,5,ride and drive are excellent and gas mileage great. the looks and comments from perfect straingers is what makes it pleasing to own.
chrysler,300,2006,john doe, 10/22/2005,abc,4,"low winshield. difficult to see traffic lights when up close. sometimes using the sun roof to see the traffic light makes it easier. however, then you have to move up to the stop line. that brings you close to the center of traffic. nevertheless, it's something you get use to. the car is dynamite. i am told so by people on the street every day. the guys just go on about the design and the ladies, it's the unspoken look.  good job "
chrysler,300,2006,BJ, 10/23/2005,Cruise Control,5,"Now have 6,000 miles on my 300C. I love it, just finished a 2100 mile trip with interstste speed limits of 75mph. When you set cruise control at 78 mph it maintains it at all times. All other cars and trucks lose a mph or two on upgrades, the 300C doec not have to shift down to maintain speed on steep upgrades.  Seats are very comfortable and no need to make adjustments after hours of driving. This car gets the looks and questions when you are at the gas pumps. Oh yes, average mpg was 24 even for the 2100 mile trip with average speed about 70 overall."
chrysler,300,2006,Jennifer Chahoud, 10/25/2005,Miss C,4,"I absolutely love this care. For being my first car at the age of 16 well that's amazing. The style, the body, the interior its all so nice! but I got to say that it would be nicer to have the 300C stand out on the inside more then the 300. To me they're not the same car even if they do look alike besides the headlights and chrome features and Hemi 350. 300c should be recognized."
chrysler,300,2006,Silvia Merjil-Fritz, 10/30/2005,Vintage look & Luxury-all in one,4,"I absolutely fell in love with the ""vintage"" look of this vehicle but when I actually had a test drive, I knew this was to be my next vehicle.  This car has all expected in a comfortable, luxurios ride.  The extras like satellite radio, navigation system, mp3, (6) CD player, heated leather seats, dual air/heat temperature controls, rear seat air/heat, automatic rearview mirror dimmer and extra large trunk are absolutely exceptional.  I would only warn perspective buyers of one thing, the small front side windows for the driver and passenger can at times make it difficult to get a clear side view, badly needed views necessary for entering freeways or exiting curbside parking. "
chrysler,300,2006,str8-voom, 11/04/2005,SRT8 Value,4,"I have owned more expensive European and Japanese models, the SRT8 is the best value for dollar paid in terms of performance and build quality. Must driveit at the SRT Experience Trials."
chrysler,300,2006,D. Marts, 11/03/2005,My Wonderful Chrysler 300C Hemi,4,Everytime I get into my Chrysler 300C I find it more enjoyable to drive. I truly enjoy the GPS as it gives me perfect directions to areas that I am not familiar with. + Chrysler really put together a car that people stop and take a second look at and I enjoy every mile I drive it. It is perhaps the safest car on the road which is a good feeling after just having had an accident in a much smaller car. 
chrysler,300,2006,JASMINE, 11/06/2005,MY 2006 CHRYSLER 300SRT8,4,"This is an absolutely superb automobile: built with the highest quality and like a tank. It's power and torque are also fantastic, the design is magnificent.  It has every luxury feature imaginable and more so: too long to list. Having carefully researched it is the best four door sedan on the American Market.  It eats BMW'S 3 and 5 series for breakfast. Even the vaunted M5 doesn't have it's 420 lbft of torque. Yes there if often a hefty premium but it's worth it! "
chrysler,300,2006,charger srt8, 11/17/2005,300C Car of the year,5,Best car ever!!!!! it takes other company guts to build this kind of car that has speed and luxury at the same time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! a new mercedes benz.
chrysler,300,2006,Wayne, 11/17/2005,Great Car,4,"I have owned a lot of nice cars, but this one is one of the most fun cars I have ever had"
chrysler,300,2006,Company Car, 11/18/2005,"Looks great, needs fine tuning!",3,"This is a very stylish car that gets comments from everyone!  It is a huge attention grabber.  Unfortunately, I drive 35,000 miles a year and spend a lot of time in it.  The cloth seats are miserable - very stiff.  The two cup holders are small in front.  With a baby car seat in back, the back seat has no cup holders at all.  The check engine light comes on if the gas cap is not sealed 100% per the dealer.  The six disc CD and stereo are very nice.  I would not buy the base model car if given a choice."
chrysler,300,2006,Kelly, 11/19/2005,Avalon?!? Five Hundred?!? HA!,5,"First, to the nay-sayers: you ALL know that NOTHING can touch this car for the price. The feeling you get from driving it ALONE is worth the price. Finally the opportunity was made available for average joes to recieve a little extra respect. It doesn't matter how much of a square you may be, this car will make you appear to be the most cool, together person around. The bad news is this car is such a joy to drive, you won't notice all the looks and attention you'll be getting!!! Even on the mean streets and freeways of California, this car is literally able to make unmanageable traffic a thing of the past. If you think it, it will be done. The car seriously borders on the intuitive. No joke."
chrysler,300,2006,Bill, 12/26/2005,Love this car,5,I've had this car for a month now and I love everything about it.  The ride is very smooth.  I find the seats very comfortable on long business trips.  I upgraded the sound system to the multi- CD player and side curtain air bags.  Everyone that sees this car loves it.  It's as much fun to look at as it is to drive.
chrysler,300,2006,El_Raven, 12/27/2005,Awesome!! - Go Get One!,4,"I'm 6'5"" and never thought of buying a car.  I always drove trucks and SUVs.  One day a car service was using this car and I was in the back seat as a passenger.  I couldn't believe the room.  A few weeks later, I test drove it and I have more room in the front seat than I did in my Expedition.  The price/performance ratio for this car is insanely attractive.  More HP, all the internal features, Mercedes styling and suspension for 30%-40% off other luxury vehicles.  I couldn't pass it up.  My wife made me a happy man this Xmas!"
chrysler,300,2006,DAVID WOYTHAL, 12/27/2005,VALUE,5,"I think it is one well-built car and definitely a great value for the money. It has plenty of power when needed and when driven sensibly gets great gas mileage for a 4000 lb.vehicle. It is by far the best Chrysler vehicle I have ever owned, and I have been buying Chrysler products since 1972.The paint and fit and finish were outstanding. Definitely a big winner in my book."
chrysler,300,2006,Leon Remington, 12/27/2005,Drives Like a Dream,4,It drives like a dream. I can drive miles without the leg pain and back pain that I get when driving other vehicles. There is always extra power if needed. I can set the cruise control and watch the miles disappear.
chrysler,300,2006,skullflower, 12/27/2005,Awesome!!!,5,"We purchased this vehicle almost two months ago, and I still get excited to run simple errands. The power, the luxury, and the fun qualities of this vehicle, make it jaw dropping.  The quality is as good as it looks.  It really is a luxury vehicle, with more power than most vehicles and trucks on the road!!!"
chrysler,300,2006,buck parrish, 12/31/2005,Beautiful Car,4,"I have had my 300c for six months now and love it. I have not seen any other car on the road that I would rather be driving (In the $40,000 price range). The hemi offers power and the exterior design is a thing of beauty. It has a roomy interior for people that are tall and/or have big bones. The navigation system and wood grain options are both big pluses. Passengers are treated with a roomy back seat. As long as I do not have mechanical problems I can see myself driving this car for a very long time. Overall this car is a hoot to drive and with the bold design expect to turn a few heads, especially if you pimp it out after market."
chrysler,300,2006,AK Peppard, 12/31/2005,# fifteen is # one!,4,"Purchased my first new Chrysler in 1965. Between then and now I have had two Pontiacs, three Fords and fourteen more Chryslers. My present 2006 is clearly the overall winner. "

chrysler,300,2006,rich300, 01/04/2006,Thomas 2006,5,"It's the car of my dreams, I have been waiting to get one since 1999 when they 1st come out and I finally got the opprotunity to get one!  The car handles like a dream on the on the highway it is outstanding. Everywhere that we go people stop and ask us where did we get the car from. My husband and I will more than likely purchase another one in the very near future. Thanks for making a wonderfull car! The Thomas"
chrysler,300,2006,Silvia, 01/07/2006,Candy to the eye,4,"I love my 2006 Chrysler 300L!  It is beautiful to look at, so comfortable to ride in and the highway mileage can't be beat.  When traveling over 50 mph on the road, put it in cruise.  Chrysler has built in a mechanism that shifts my vehicle from a 6 cylinder to a 4 cylinder and I get 460 miles to the tank!  The only complaint I have is that the engine is kinda loud for a luxury car.  But it definitely has POWER and COMFORT.  I love, love, love my beautiful car!  Silvia, El Paso, TX"
chrysler,300,2006,Ken M, 01/07/2006,300C Hemi,5,"We have had our loaded 300C for just one month and we are very happy with the purchase. Everyone comments on how beautiful the car is. It is an incredible deal for the money. Can't wait to drive it every day. It is not perfect, but for the money what is!! Couldn't be happier. 

Will write another review in a few months."
chrysler,300,2006,Jerry Engle, 01/08/2006,2006 SRT-8 driving experience,4,"I drive about 60 miles a day on both interstate and country two lane roads. The performance is wonderful. The ride is very stable but you do feel the road through the tires and solid suspension which I expected. I find find myself disengaging the traction control so I can experience the true power.The care is all that I expected.I previously owned an BMW M5 but I like this car much better and 20,000 dollars less. I installed a K&N cold air system and have a chip ordered to install also."
chrysler,300,2006,Roberta, 01/08/2006,Awesome,5,This is by far the most fun car I have ever driven.  The ultimate dream for every child at heart!  I am waiting for an opportunity to take it somewhere where I can let it run and not worry about getting a huge speeding ticket.  I had a young boy on a bicycle tell me what a sharp car it was----he was willing to trade his bike for the car!   One of the local police officers was almost drooling over the car when he saw it.  
chrysler,300,2006,ytellmey, 01/08/2006,Powerful Fun,4,"Incredibly powerful driving fun. Plush interior, lots of gadgets to play with. Bluetooth calling and heated seats are just a few of the now essential features I use.  GPS is very helpful, esp driving around Los Angeles. Sound system is wonderful and ""control center"" very intuitive, integrating phone, CDs, radio, satellite radio, GPS all on the steering wheel.  Car feels safe. Enormous trunk space. Barely 3000 miles on the odometer, but enjoying every drive thoroughly."
chrysler,300,2006,Johnny, 01/09/2006,"""Bombastic !!!""",4,"Test drove all three models (Hemi last). Boy was that fun. Best Car I have ever owned. MOST BANG FOR THE BUCK than anything in or out of class. Have not had it on the open road, but am impressed on local highways. Power is key with this piece of joy."
chrysler,300,2006,JThompson, 01/09/2006,Worth every penny!!!!!!!,4,"Although I purchased the base model, I couldn't imagine the ride being any better.  Appointments are elegant, styling is great.  Worth every penny"
chrysler,300,2006,Thomas , 01/18/2006,Good Car but not great,3,My 2006 Chrysler 300 Touring AWD is a very good car the ride is smooth and comfortable the steering is tight and handles well the engine really loves to guzzle up the fuel with this AWD and the rear seat is not as roomy as you might expect and i really like the exterior design nice and sleek except in my opinion the car doesnt look long enough it looks like it they chopped off the trunk but i wished i had looked around a bit more i would have got one of the more modern cars in this class like the Mercury Grand Marquis or Montego and Ford Five Hundred but i am fairly happy with my 300 its a good car 
chrysler,300,2006,Brad, 01/20/2006,300c srt8,4,This car is the most fun car to drive when looking for a vehicle that will look like the family car with the performance to take on just about anything.
chrysler,300,2007,Ben, 10/05/2006,07 300C A Dream Car,5,"I purchased an Inferno Red 07 300C on August 31st and it a dream.  It drives beautifully, and rides just as nice.  I got it almsot fully optioned accept for U-Connect and the Rear DVD system.  I traded in an 04 PT Turbo and while I was satisfied with that, I am truly satisfied with the 300C.  Thank you Chrysler for making such a good product.  "
chrysler,300,2007,mjp, 10/26/2006,300 Great Auto,5,My 300 Touring is a dream car for comfort and styling.  The navigation system is a farce.  I have a 250 Garmin handheld that is far superior to the $1800 for the navigation system. Alpine is not interested in working to improve or upgrade a very antiquated program disc. I have about 1900 miles on my vehicle and have been getting about 25 on the interstate.   Ride is wonderful.  Cruise control lever could be changed.  Easy to hit it versus the turn signal.  Sound system is outstanding.  Styling is fantastic.  Overall I am very please except for the navigation system.
chrysler,300,2007,Louise, 12/12/2006,New Owner Driving Experience,5,The vehicle is a beautiful car and I have received numerous compliments from young and older people both.  The car drives well and my 250 HP engine performs good.  Vehicle is very roomy. Visibility is not terrific but with time and extra effort you learn the blind spots and how to compensate & can drive safely and with ease.  The vehicle is quiet and comfortable.  The power heated mirrors are really nice.  I like having the Electronic Stability and Anti-lock 4-wheel disc brakes.
chrysler,300,2007,Hyman Arbesfeld, 12/30/2006,Best car I ever had,5,"I leased a 2007 300C AWD after coming off a two year lease on a 2005 Cadillac STS.  Best move I ever made.  The design, in Inferno Red, is a real head turner.  The power and interior comfort can't be matched.  With the options I took, I have very feature I could want, at an unbelievable low price."
chrysler,300,2007,Julie Hines, 10/27/2006,My favorite car I've ever owned!,5,"I love my new 300c from it's classy looks to it's wonderful ride. The power gives a real sense of confidence on the road when the need to accelerate quickly presents itself. The interior is so comfortable. I love all the automatic features you can set such as the headlights and the wipers. The navigation system is great. The Boston Acoustic sound system has high quality sound. After driving SUVs for 10 years, I was concerned I would feel cramped in a sedan. Not so in the 300, the interior is quite roomy and there is lots of leg room. The trunk is quite spacious as well. "
chrysler,300,2007,Jordan, 12/19/2006,Great Car for the Buck,4,My wife and I just returned or our 2003 BMW-X5 after lease just ended. The Chrysler 300 is such a great car for the cost. I can almost say I like it more than the X-5 and its half the price. Don't figure! Hope this helps. We like it a lot!
chrysler,300,2007,carlos, 12/31/2006,excellent car,5,The car drives well and my 250 HP engine performs good. Vehicle is very roomy. Rear visibility is not terrific. The vehicle is quiet and comfortable. The power gives a real sense of confidence on the road when the need to accelerate quickly. 
chrysler,300,2007,H& A , 01/06/2007,Best Car Ever,5,"The exterior design, particularly in the inferno red color, is a real head turner. I am 6'1"" and wear a fedora hat. I never had a car I could so high; what a joy. The power is unreal.  This car had all the features & options that would have cost me much more in a ""luxury"" car."
chrysler,300,2007,Matt, 02/24/2016,Best Bang for Your Buck!,4,"I bought my Chrysler 300c around 6 months ago with 73K miles.  Its by far my favorite car I've ever owned.  The power is good but it is a heavy car.  I had a single cab 05 Chevy Silverado Z71 with the upgraded engine putting out 290 horsepower before the 300c and it felt like it put you back in your seat more than the 340 horsepower Chrysler 300c.  It might be because the ride is so smooth in the 300c or because the center of gravity is lower.  I do a lot of city driving and I'm getting around 15 mpg average which is a little lower than the 17 advertised (90% of the time I have my daughter with me and I drive like Miss Daisy) but with the hemi that was expected.  What I wasn't expecting is how good the gas mileage is on the highway.  If I reset my MPG average setting when I get on the highway it calculates quickly and gets up over 32 mpg.  There are major blind spots though so you really have to check twice and know your surroundings.  Also the comfortably of the driver seat could be better.  It feels like its made for a much larger man.  I'm 6ft 200lbs and it doesn't hug my back at all.  I have a 2,200 mile road trip coming up and I'm not looking forward to the foreseen back pain in my future.  I'm looking at replacing the front seats with Challenger seats with hopes they will be more form fitting.  The traction control needs some work.  If you give it to much gas when accelerating the traction control kicks in and controls your launch.  I've learned to turn the ESP off every time I start up my car.  From what I've seen on older models when I was searching the market is looks like the clear coat on the faux wood grain on the steering wheel and interior door handles flakes easily.  With theses negatives being easy to fix I'm planing on keeping this car for life and adding a stroker kit and or a supercharger.  If I ever trade this car in it will be for a newer SRT8.  Its a little slow on the launch but when you hit 60 is when It really wakes up and gets scary fast.  It just keeps pulling!  Even at 120 mph you still feel like you're riding on a cloud.  Another down side is the speed limiter that is set at 126 mph due to the tires put on from the factory are only rated for 130 mpg.  From what I have researched it looks like the actual top speed is 175 mph.  Now I know I will never go that fast (maybe once) but it would be nice to brag about being close to super car speed.  Putting a speed limiter so low is kinda like a kick in the balls.  Handling is great for such a big car.  Its a true American muscle car with all the luxury features you'd find in your Mercedes, Lexus and BMWs at an affordable price with great reliability.  You also wont have to take this car to a specialized mechanic and pay extremely high repair costs.  The perfect combination of reliability, luxury, and power on a limited budget.
"
chrysler,300,2007,Hemilover, 04/18/2010,Fantastic car!,4,"If you drive this car you will buy it! The 300C has everything you'd want. Mileage is not bad at all for a Hemi. I've been getting 22 mpg on the highway. The power, handling, styling is exceptional. Chrysler should advertise this car!"
chrysler,300,2007,Scott, 08/22/2016,Luv it!,5,"I had a 2000 Camry and wanted something sporty looking.  I am 6'6"" and I needed something I could fit in.  Sitting down is a little tricky to not hit my head but after getting in there is plenty of room.  I looked at a Crossfire but too small.  I looked at Corvettes but too small.  Then I tried a 300 and it was just right!  A warning . . . . do not try to learn about the dash displays while driving!  There was an incident my second day of ownership due to me looking at the dash and steering wheel and not looking at the red light!   Mine is red and you do not see many of those.  I am 66 years old and I have had a 1967 GTX and a 1965  GTO  and 1963, 1968 Sport Furies and a nice 1967 Satellite,  and many many other cars but this is the best next to the 1967 Satellite!  The Satellite was just Bad Ass  with a 4 spd and 383 Magnum.  The 300 is also Bad Ass and very fun to drive and gets lots of glances!  Prolly my last car!

chrysler,300,2007,SMK, 10/20/2006,Don't get the base motor,3,"I had to get this car because my company went to company cars. I was driving an 05 Acura TSX. The 300 that I have has the ABS and the side curtain air bags. The base motor is just not powerful enough. I would have preferred the 3.5 motor, but it was not an option."
chrysler,300,2007,rollin59, 03/21/2010,Speedboat,4,"This is a superb car.  I was looking for a late model fast, V8 powered sporty car, looked at 07-09 Mustang GT and Camaro.  Mustang rides like a lumber wagon on rough roads.  Camaro has too little head room and both had kind of chintzy interior.  A friend who has a Magnum kept raving about the 5.7 Hemi with multi-displacement.  Short story, I test drove a 300C Hemi and wound up buying a low mileage lease return.  So far (1 month) a great car."

chrysler,300,2007,Chris Olsen, 07/15/2015,Looking for another,5,"The most reliable vehicle I have ever owned. First the cons: issue with one of the rear heated seats switch, it would turn on and start flashing, then shut off. The lighting for both front seat heater switches went out, along with the variable fan speed switch and the analog clock. Navigation flat out sucked...I paid for the new navigation CD/DVD and had nothing but problems with it, so I stopped using it. Plus I would receive an error message every so often saying the disk had failed to load, and it was hell to eject it. The pros: everything else. For the model year I had every option but bluetooth and adaptive cruise control. he car purred like a champ, that is until I ended up in a flood (a foot of water running down the road) and sucked water into my air intake and hydro locked the engine. So I guess the only other negative is positioning of the air intake, move it to the wheel well.
That said, I would still not hesitate to purchase another one. Just look out for water six inches or above.

Because of the economy, I thought I'd better scale down and buy something less expensive.  I did, and man am I surprised! I thought I was skimping, but got one of the best cars I've ever owned.  I honestly can't find ONE thing to complain about.  It's quiet, roomy, comfortable, fast, exceptionally impressive and economical. You can take it to Home Depot, load the trunk with no problem. Take it to the country club later and park it with the big boys!  .. all for the price of a Honda.  I'm totally happy with it. "

The gear shaft has gotten stuck in Park, so I had to replace that! The car had major electrical problems. I've replaced the ""Hood Switch"" which makes the car think that the hood is open, according to Don Jackson. The eps & traction light continues 2 come on, & the dealership still doesn't know whats wrong with it. The radio sounds muffled & the lighter doesn't work, after changing the fuses twice!!

This car is a great value for the money and has features of much higher priced luxury cars... The car has style,class,room, a nice quiet ride,performance and is fun to drive. People in parking lots stop to admire the car. I know that it is not PC to own a vehicle that has performance, but, for me, this is a trip back in time,, I remember the first Hemis...

chrysler,300,2007,Lawrence Harper, 02/01/2009,Rating Review,4,"This is one of the most classically designed reasonably priced vehicles on the road today. Chrysler 300C needs about a 30% Improvement in interior &  rear traction Imperfections to be the best model on the market, in its category. Most serious problem with Model 300C Non-Four Wheel Drive is a ""Serious Lack of Rear Traction, in Snow""."
chrysler,300,2007,300C Fan Club, 02/09/2010,Total SAFETY & Total QUALITY - luv' em!,4,"300C/Hemi is a total underdog in the luxury sedan class. It's built with Mercedes Benz' M-series body so it's got the comfort, roominess, and smooth marshmallow ride.   Most importantly, 300C's SAFETY Rating (esp. Frontal Crash Test which is the most fatal) is one of the tops in this category of sedans per research data. And, at the current market price, it's a steal!!!   Also, as a Petite Female Driver, I appreciate Chrysler's foresight in providing features like adjustable pedals, highly adjustable seats, etc. to  make it possible for me to drive a rather voluminous car despite my height.  Owned this car since '07 and had 0 problem.  LUV 'em and will only buy Chryslers from now on.    "

chrysler,300,2007,me, 06/03/2009,My second 300C,4,"This is my second 300C, after trading in a 2005 RWD.  The first one was an early build, first model year and it had several small annoyances, some of which were fixed under warranty.  The 2007 has been problem-free.  AWD is great in a car like this, you can take off in any weather with no wheel hop; not that RWD was unusable in snow, but the OEM Continental tires that wore out in 10K miles were the real culprit.  Your mileage may vary, but it can honestly get 25mpg with the car loaded and the A/C on in hilly terrain."
chrysler,300,2007,dhoolwerf, 05/13/2008,LOVE this car!,4,"I've been admiring the 300C since its debut in 2005, and finally went out and bought one; a 2007 300C SRT Design model.  The SRT Design shares some of the appearance cues of the SRT8, such as 20"" wheels, trunk-mounted spoiler, suede seat inserts and leather-wrapped steering wheel, but has the smaller 5.7 liter hemi.  My fuel economy fluctuates between 18 and 20 mpg with mixed highway/city driving, which is better than the V6-powered Isuzu SUV that this car replaced, so I have no complaints about the fuel consumption.  The car is comfortable, quiet, stylish, fast, and is very well equipped, plus has a lifetime powertrain warranty; a lot of car for the money.  I highly recommend this car!"

I got stranded 3 yrs ago.
I cannot shift my gear to reverse position and was told that 2006 Chrysler 300 had the same problem.
The spring inside the shifter was defective.
Up to this time, I was waiting for a recall just like the 2006 models.
Unfortunately, my car was broken into 6 months ago and my receipt for the repair were among the things taken.
I was about to get a copy from the dealership, but they went out of business.
I was frustrated to know that the main plant in Detroit does not have a main database for all record of repairs done for cars that they sold."
chrysler,300,2007,LaDeana, 01/05/2007,Don't be a fool,1,Bought the first 300 in Nov. '06.  At 429 miles I realized there were serious problems which the dealer said were not problems but normal driving.  At 650 miles they finally replaced with a new car.  At 449 miles it started doing the same thing the other had done.  Took it in & the dealer said it was the Torque Converter and replaced that.  Now it has a shimmy and bumps along the road.  HATE THE CAR!

So I took it to the dealer where I purchased it. The dealer told me the gas tank had a hole in it from rubbing on the frame and it was $1100.00 dollars to repair. They are saying do to the age and miles on the car they will not repair it. 
It want pass the Ohio aim test because of the check engine light being on. The 30 day temp plate has expired. Moreover its a very poor and un-safe design if the gas tank rubs on anything.

I refuse to drive a car that may explode. A gas tank should never rub anything. I have no car now. what can I do."

Got a smoking deal on a 2007 Dealer car: 6300 miles, 5 speed auto stick (unavailable on the newer 3.5 models), leather, sun roof. Traded in a 2004 Liberty due to the gas mileage. I have just got the 300 and I've averaged 25 MPG! Great for a large car. Golf clubs and three wheel cart fits easily in the trunk. The cruise control is in an odd spot, and the drivers window is the only one with one touch down (Liberty had both front windows one touch down). Ride is excellent, and I am looking forward to a long, happy, and satisfying relationship."

chrysler,300,2007,Kurt, 04/25/2007,Great Car,5,Very fun car to drive. Lots of power even in the 3.5. Great stereo. I listen at 25/35 and the windows and mirrors are shaking.  Fuel economy was a pleasant surprise as I'm getting 20- 21 mph and thats mostly in traffic. Because the windows are smaller there are some blind spots and its hard to reach the ATM.

chrysler,300,2007,ML, 05/22/2008,Maximum Bang for the Buck,4,"Absolutely love the car. You can't beat the value here. Where else, besides the other SRT8s, can you get a 425hp motor, race tuned suspension and Brembos for around $40k? Nowhere!  Exterior styling isn't my favorite, but it gets tons of compliments. Interior is well laid out, other then the cruise control stalk, but material quality could be better.  As far as performance goes, this car easily keeps up with the German performance sedans and annihilates the American and Japanese ones. That goes for acceleration, which goes without saying, but also handling, where the SRT8 puts up handling numbers, comparable to the M5, and that shame cars such as the E55 and STS-V.  Very impressive."
chrysler,300,2007,Mike, 06/11/2008,Great car to drive!!,5,"I love driving my 300C AWD.  I traded in my 2006 Charger Daytona in Go- Mango.  I loved that car, and what a head turner it was! I traded for a Jeep commander Limited, which I just could not get used to.  I prefer a car and the Jeep was so big and was a real gas guzzler with the HEMI.  I traded after 6 weeks for a Chrysler 300C AWD that is completely loaded, including Nav. and backseat DVD, which my 7 yr.old grandson loved on a recent 650 mile road trip.   This is a remarkable vehicle.  The 300C in infernal red is also a head turner, but more sedate than the Daytona. I think it is more comfortable than the Charger, and while not the R/T it still has lots of power, and that great HEMI sound."
chrysler,300,2007,jspencer, 06/16/2008,Thunk Problems,4,"The only major complaint I would have with the Chrysler 300 is the ""thunk"" you feel when you slowly take off from a light and you hear a hard thunk (as though someone has hit you from the rear). The ""thunk"" sound also occurs when you are trying to reverse the vehicle. The Salesman along with Chrysler repair man says that Chrysler is aware of the ""thunk"" sound and that is has something to do with the ""Tranny"" and since the car has 3 computerized components, each components has different functions and they are playing catch up to each other when you hear that slight thunk.

The parts were very hard to find, and Chrysler Inc did not want to take any responsibility. Chrysler personnel have very poor customer skills and a very poor customer service both at the dealer and at the manufacturer.  Car has run out of gas several times with the fuel gauge showing over 1/4 of a tank.  Dealer and Manufacturer have seen nothing wrong and released this car to me.  I have ran out of gas in this vehicle at least 5 times, and sometimes on the freeway.  The support for this car is horrible."

Picked up the 2007 Touring (ex-Rental) for 14K at a local GM dealer, added chrome 18"" 300c wheels and Goodyear Eagle Response Edge tires.  What a difference!   It now handles like my old 300m which had a 'performance/handling package'.  Same 3.5L V6 moves it around pretty well, and gets 27 mpg highway.  I drive windy mountain roads daily, and use the auto-stick to keep it in 3rd up to 45mph.  On the hwy, it slips into 5th, and just flat cruises.  RWD took some time to adjust to, but handles well.  The stock stereo sounds almost as good as the old 300m. The aux jack connects to an MP3 player or ??.  GSM replaces compass/computer."

This car is exceptionally designed inside and out and I'd challenge anyone to try it and tell me that it doesn't rival cars costing much more in both performance and appearance.

chrysler,300,2007,Whiteknee, 07/07/2007,Surprised!,4,This is the best company car I've ever had. I selected it because I had read that components like the transmission and suspension were sourced from the Mercedes 300. Whether this is true or not I can honestly say that the suspension is firm yet compliant like a Mercedes (I owned  260E in the late 80's) and the transmission has been flawless. The autostick is more fun then an regular automatic and the 250 HP six gets up and goes. Plenty of room inside - I'm 6'3 250lb - interior is stark but functional. Stereo is above average for out-of-the-box US car.  Wish it had 18 or 19 inch wheels but I can live without them. I am pleasantly surprised with this car. Audi A8=10; this is a solid 8!
chrysler,300,2007,Dawn Myers, 10/19/2007,My Wish Come True,4,"This car was a gift & is a gift to anyone who owns one. It drives like no other car I've been in, I have fallen in love with this car.  It's smooth almost gliding over the road and handles effortlessly.  I find myself driving most every weekend and taking the backroads with the top down & listening to crystal crisp music surrounding me.  Whoever's with me can't stop admiring ""Ben"", my 300C Hemi Convertible.  However it doesn't stop there, I get stares, comments, questions or a smiling acknowledgement from people all the time.  Strange at first, but nice and now it's a pleasant way to talk to people.  PS I wished for a 4 door convertible for my anniversary"
chrysler,300,2007,Exlex, 11/13/2007,What a Surprise,4,"I have been driving a Lexus LS400 for 8 years.  From the moment I sat behind the wheel of this vehicle and stepped on the accelerator I was hooked. On the highway  the power and acceleration is awesome. The ride is as smooth and quiet as my Lexus. It even handles turns well. The dash is contemporary yet classic. I love the analog clock. My car came with Sirius for one year as an extra bonus.  No nav or sunroof.  I never used the sunroof on my Lex. Otherwise evrything else loaded (leather, heated seats, auto telescoping steering wheel, premium speakers. Just a great package.  I also drove the V6 3.5.  The road feel was similar.  There is a big drop off in power and acceleration."
chrysler,300,2007,RJ, 03/15/2008,300C Best Bang for your Buck!,4,Coming out of a 00 Jag XJ8 brought a little concern w/No regrets. The interior room is much welcome (5 adults comfortably) along with nice size trunk.  Fit & Finish is not the same.  American manufactures do not understand that they need to offer less options.  Offer 2 or 3 packages.  The performance is better except for steering. Quiet & Comfortable ride + price=  Five Stars.  You will not find a nicer car for the money along with lifetime warranty.
chrysler,300,2007,Dragsterboy, 12/11/2007,Sometimes cheaper is better!,4,"Yes, after doing lots of seat time at the computer and stopping at all the local dealers in the Houston area to get information and a hands on experience of what is being offered to the motoring public I chose the Chrysler 300 Touring package above the GM, Ford and Japanese offerings. Chrysler, with the input of the Daimler group have seem to have struck an accord of styling, performance, and affordability that the competition could not match. Not only is the bold styling a hit, the exterior/interior color combinations available wonderful, the vehicles actually look good in the colors offered.  Don't pass up the opportunity to compare and see the real value of the 300 marque.  "

chrysler,300,2007,Mark, 05/01/2008,a really nice car,4,"My 300 is a great car for me and I am very happy I decided on this over some others. I looked at foreign and domestic cars in this class but ultimately chose the 300, with the price the final decider.  I am very satisfied with the 3.5 V6, and the mpg savings over the hemi makes it a worthwhile choice for me.  It is very roomy and comfortable. Pleasure to drive, not a sports car but fun. Extremely quiet inside even at 85 mph.  At first I was afraid the ""chopped"" look meant poor visibility but not the case.  My former car was an Aurora and I miss its oomph but I don't miss the low mpg, high maintenance cost and amenities that were an annoyance at times.  "
chrysler,300,2007,Dixie, 05/09/2008,The best car ever!,5,I bought this car after admiring it for a couple of years.  I have had no regrets!  I love it.  Everyone compliments its looks and if I were to ever let anyone else drive it (which I won't) they would love the speed and handling.  It is always first out at the stoplight!
chrysler,300,2007,Jeanette, 05/16/2008,My chrysler,4,It is a really nice car I have enjoyed driving it but I need better gas mileage because I drive 82 miles a day to work and cannot afford the gas prices.
chrysler,300,2007,David, 05/28/2008,Great Car for the money,5,"This is probably the finest car I've ever owned. I have owned Cadillac, big Buicks, several Pontiacs, and this one tops them all. I traded a Dodge Ram 1500 Quad Cab (HEMI) because of gas mileage, and I am very happy I did. The mileage has been averaging in the mid-20's with the 3.5 L HO engine on a 35 mile one-way daily commute. Plenty of power, and good mileage too. Best of both worlds. The car rides and handles great, a true road car, but nimble around town as well. Lots of room inside and creature comforts galore. I absolutely love it!"
chrysler,300,2008,My Fine 300 Cruiser, 09/03/2007,My Rating of the Chrsyler 300,5,"Bought car then set off for North Carolina. Handled great on freeways. Gas consumption above anticipated level. Great car to drive. Recommend it highly. Wife likes it, too! Go Chrysler...keep 'em coming"
chrysler,300,2008,beniciajoe, 05/06/2015,Superb Vehicle,5,"Great style, great performance and total comfort make for a superb vehicle.
This is my second 300, with the first being a 2006 Touring model. The Touring was a more balanced car, delivering everything I needed.
But the 300C Heritage Edition give me everything I want. Speed, comfort and reliability. 
Great highway cruiser, and it pulls strong up to it's 130 mph electronic limit. Nice neutral handling through the turns, and good communication as you approach the car's limit's.
Amazing comfort and stereo combine to make the miles effortless.
I now have 148,000 miles, and no problems yet - I still have the original brake pads and rotors!
Update:
Just passed 170,000 miles and the car's still running strong. I finally started to get a little warping of the front rotors at 160K, and went ahead and replaced all four rotors and installed new brake pads. Aside from the typical highway stone chips on the paint on leading edges of the car, it still looks new inside and out.
Absolutely the best car I've ever owned.
I can afford a new car, but this has everything.

chrysler,300,2008,jan56, 03/04/2011,My 2008 Chrysler 300C AWD,3,"This is my second 300C AWD.
The first was the 2006 model and I loved it.
Then I got the 2008.
What a disappointment.
It's noisy and has been having issues since day one.
Off and on electrical, the navigation system, UConnect. Additionally new rotors at a little over 12000 miles.
It's been a royal pain.
While the ride is smooth, the noise level is ridiculous.
Being on UConnect, it is difficult to hear over the noise in the cabin.
They definitely cheapened this version compared to the 2006.
I had planned to stay with Chrysler, but now, I'm thinking not.
Unless they've made some major improvements to quality, I'll take my money else where. "

Sadly I was hit by someone doing 45 at a complete stop. An my car held up like a tank compared to there's! It's also extremely comfortable an big inside for the cost. Highway mileage is 26-28 city it 17-22. Could be better but I knew what I was getting myself into. For the trim an leather seats an all the features an the low mileage an price I paid. Well worth the cost!! Had it over 8 months an not one problem. Had one recall on it an had dealership fix it free. Great car that's safe an very customizable. I've put the newer bmw/Audi angel eyes CCFL lights with bi xenon an I get nothing but compliments!

chrysler,300,2008,Julio Diaz, 03/22/2009,My review,4,"I'd been with my car barely a month, but it had been an incredible experience. The ride, the interior comfort plus the looks of the car are second to none. The engine response it fantastic, plenty of power to move the big body.  "
chrysler,300,2008,OceanP, 10/12/2009,2008 300C: A great buy,4,"After a younger generation of my family totalled my Lincoln LS on ice, I was in the market for a replacement. Drove many of the ""reliable"" imports: ranging from Infinity to Lexus. Then I drove the 300C. The others are all great cars, but none offered the classic styling and the WOW effect of the 300C, and the power of the HEMI. The car has been great so far and consistently gives 22 to 23 mpg on the highway runs visiting my kid at college. Great comfort, ride and performance to boot! And unique looks to go with it. The interior could stand to be upgraded a bit. You can see where Chrysler cut corners: But still very liveable inside and out. Just wish the exhaust note was a bit throatier."
chrysler,300,2008,ROCK, 03/03/2008,Love my 300,4,"So I went against the preferred engine and really I think the concerns are a little overrated about it. I think if you want performance slapping a massive engine in it wouldn't satisfy my personal preferences. In saying that we bought this because $4 gas will soon be a reality. The car rides incredible, the fit and finish is the best of any Chrysler I have owned by far.  The road noise is minimal and the look is just sleek it looks like a much more expensive car.  The stereo sounds great and the sets are very top notch.  We traded in a Durango and this has more leg room in the rear then our SUV had. I am really pleased with my purchase and the 25 mpg makes me smile."
chrysler,300,2008,Love my 300!, 04/14/2008,Could this be the best car ever?!!!,5,"First, I want to say about the review below; are you kidding me!  You're 5'11"" and had troubles in this car!!!  What other CAR have you ever driven that is more comfortable for you?  I'm 6'7"" and have NEVER been this comfortable in a car.  I usually have to drive full-size SUV's and trucks to be comfortable.  Also, loud engine?  What are you comparing this car to; a Rolls?  My opinion; this is hands-down the best car I have ever owned or driven!!  Incredible interior/exterior, performance (3.5 V6), gas mileage, reliability, price and any other category you want to consider.  I would have loved to be able to spring for the SRT! But this V6 is wonderful in this car (would not recommend the 2.7)."

It is the Heritage Edition, so it comes standard with many interior upgrades such as the U- Connect, NAV, MPEG with 40GIG Hardrive, as well as a very sharp camel color interior and special leather seats. In addition, the 300C comes with the standard stuff that really makes the car special...like adaptive cruise control, Bose Stereo with 400W Amp, power steering tilt and pedals, memory seats, engine cuts from 8 to 4 cylinders to save fuel etc. I could go on for days about the standard/added features features on the 300C. I am 6'5"" tall and fit in the car great. Truly a joy to drive, although gas mileage is quite disappointing. "

Didn't have any technical issues but for one -- tachometer needle went all the way around the dial and then came back to normal in an instant. That happened on several occasions. Electrical problem, I assume. It didn't rev the engine though, just the needle behaved strangely.  Very large full-size (finally!) real American vehicle. Drives fantastic! Cushy ride. Rides on Merc undercarriage actually. Smooth and seamless power delivery. Chryslers and Dodges are actually known for their powerful engines. Very stylish and comfortable car to drive."

chrysler,300,2008,John J. Goran, 11/15/2008,Two in a row,4,"I leased an 05 330C with a Hemi in it. I loved this car and was prepared to purchase it. The car was loaded and gave me zero mechanical problems. When I passed by my dealer to look around at the 08's, I discussed with them the fact that leasing was not something Chrysler was pushing. However, I was directed to an 08 300C Hemi with the SRT design package. It has the standard Hemi, but it's own 20 inch rims, handling package, steering, exhaust and other features from the SRT8.  The fuel savings not available on the SRT8 are available on the car I purchased. I love it. Great aggressive styling with multivalve- displacement giving better mileage. Have yet to see one like it on the road."
chrysler,300,2008,Terry, 12/28/2007,First Time Chrysler Owner - Mistake ??,3,"The first six days of ownership were great and enjoyable.  Great ride and appearance.  Drove the Hemi and 3.5 V6..noticed a heavier fell with the Hemi..but mileage and price for 3.5 was great.  Just over a week of ownership, I needed to use the windshield washer and when I hit it, the electrical system died, killing the engine.  A immedate release of the windshield washer resulted in a immedate restart, but in a lower gear requiring me to pull off the road.  In heavy traffic and at high speed this event could have been a significant risk to us and those that might had been behind us.  Dealer has ordered parts yet concerned that circuit board damage was result vs cause.  Time will tell."
chrysler,300,2008,Mark Robinson, 02/02/2008,Superb Vehicle,5,I have had this vehicle for a few months now and I could not be happier. Not only is it fun to drive but it always seems to draw attention. A lifetime powertrain warranty was icing on the cake for me. Will definitely purchase another Chrysler.

Lack of visibility because of high back dash and short windows. Planning on selling/ trading because of this (after two fender benders). Reliability has been excellent at 89000 mi.

January 09 loud ticking noise from engine like lifters going bad. March 09, had to replace tie rod on left side again, Still under warranty. March 2010, very loud clunky sound coming from front end. Took to dealer, report came back that left and right tension arms, left and right sway bars and right tie rod end are shot!!  Warranty covers up to 50,000 miles. I have 61,000.

I love the vehicle but here are a few suggestions: Should have auto headlights, heated seats and be able to upgrade the sound system for GPS and auto cell phone. One other thing, it is terrible in snow and ice. I need to install snows and the price is $300 per tire. That hurts."

chrysler,300,2008,Car Guy, 10/04/2007,Nice Wheels,4,"This is one great car. Extremely comfortable, powerful, fast (I see too many speeding tickets in my future), and it handles great as well. Excellent ride quality and responsive, if somewhat numb steering. Averaging over 20 MPG in mixed driving - and that's during the first 1,000 miles. Upgraded Boston Acoustics stereo is worth the money - makes the car a rolling sound studio. Exceptional build quality for an American car. I personally see no downside to the car, except possibly the gas mileage - but what do you expect from a 5.7L V-8?"

Best decision we ever made!  Avalon was NOT the trouble free car made out to be.  Took 300C delivery in October, traveled to Fl. in Jan and to the West in Feb. What a road machine!!  Went up Interstate mountain roads full 70 mph without any transmission shifting. Never had any vehicle do that.  Engine would simply go from 4 cyl to 8.  No effort making the climb.  Hit snow in some high elev and the AWD had us going when others were having all kinds of fun.  Did 70 mph on the level running on 4 cyl!  This car brings back the pleasure of driving.  Had forgotten how great driving could be. "

If you trust the pro reviews, the 2.7 is just too wimpy to swing this bad boy around. Not enough power, they whine. Sure, I'd love to have the Hemi SRT8. But I can't even imagine how powerful that car must be. But there's NOTHING wimpy about the 2.7. It zips and zooms, handles like a dream. So for around 20k, I get a stylish, luxurious head-turner, with Mercedes E Class underpinnings. Sure, everyone THINKS the car is way faster than it is. And maybe that's why the pros dig on the 2.7. It's just not worthy. But I LOVE this car. It saved me from boring large, boring sedanville. Definitely the coolest big boy sedan under 25K!"

Had I owned the 300 prior to the Mercedes I would never have purchased the Mercedes.  The 300 is just as much fun to drive, has the same comfort level and only lacks some rear seat leg room in comparison.  This won't be my last 300 but this will be my last MB S430."

chrysler,300,2008,JAY, 06/22/2008,Interiors,4,"To me the car is flawless except for some parts to the interior.  Why there is only an off-White headliner is beyond me.  Cream or light tan would add so much more class.  The total black dash with tortoise-shell accents is great, but the headliner should either match or be contrasted with something softer.  The two-toned dash looks off somehow.  Also, a body style like this craves darker colors, like maroon metal flake, to show off the lines.  Color selection is so limited. Right now, only black looks good enough to buy.  The dash could be more 3- dimensional, and not so flat, but the blue glow should stay.  You guys are close, though."
chrysler,300,2008,300 Dream, 07/22/2008,Dream come true,4,"I saw the 2005 300 and knew THAT was a car.  Once they offered lifetime warranty I felt it was time to get that dream car before they re-design it.  I got the Touring V6 as I do not need a Hemi to say I have arrived, or for the thrill of it.  I have taken two long trips already and find the car very comfortable and economical.  I get around 18 around town and up to 28 on the highway.  The AWD is a must in Alaska.  Knowing that it has the E-class suspension and 4-matic transmission is very comforting.  I hear people think the interior is lacking, but I guess after 5 years of big Ford trucks, it seems quite plush to me.  I did get some upgrades that included extra airbags and the blue tooth."
chrysler,300,2008,Mike, 01/31/2008,This one is a winner,4,"Just bought this vehicle after being a big Cadillac Seville fan.  I was looking for an AWD vehicle and looked at the Infiniti M and Lexus GS, finally drove this one and for about 12k less (based on my final cost) this was hands down the best buy.  Interior design and materials aren't Lexus or Infiniti but they are far better than any of the other vehicles I had looked at including the Cadillac.  Good ride, will go through anything (within reason), excellent entertainment system, great seats, and one of the few cars that you can get rear seat heaters in.  Back seat is comfortable and you actually have leg room.  Exceptionally quiet too.  The price after rebates and discounts was amazing."

chrysler,300,2008,Peter R, 03/14/2008,Pleasantly Surprised,4,"I was very reluctant to purchase an American car after experiencing the reliability of some Japanese makes, but I must say, this car feels extremely well built and it really delivers a superior ride and feel than the Japanese cars I've driven.  Even with the base LX, you still get a well appointed semi-luxurious ride with an adequate engine.  It's tough to complain about the 2.7L when it delivers gas mileage in the mid to high 20's.   I am really impressed with this car and would highly recommend it.    If you're looking at any Nissan, Honda, or Toyota in the low-mid $20's, give the 300 a chance."
chrysler,300,2008,asjemery, 03/27/2008,Blah Blah,3,"Nicely styled exterior with those narrow windows results in limited  visibility that is borderline dangerous.  Between the front roof post and side view mirrors...look out on turns.  The interior was spacious but bland, with nothing to recommend or criticize too hard.  I had the V6, which made the car's interior sound like a truck, and was the noisiest I've driven in years.  It did provide good acceleration, and was well matched to the car's below average handling.  The engine was not as thirsty as I feared.  I got 22-24 mpg in mostly suburban driving.  Handling is only adequate - you really have to work the steering wheel, and the car's long wheelbase doesn't help.  "
chrysler,300,2008,Tim, 02/26/2020,"Gorgeous car, but utterly unreliable",2,"One of the most beautiful cars in history in my opinion. Unfortunately, I found it to be beyond unreliable.

I doubted buying one after hearing so many warnings about Chrysler, but the looks sold me. I was told the engine is built by Mercedes, so I hoped this model was a safer purchase. How foolish of me though... 

I've spent an average of $4000 a year just on fixing malfunctions. Electric parts failed constantly, and literally hoped for a successful engine start each time I turned the ignition on (due to a mysterious flaw which +3 official dealers couldn't fix).

Among other issues, my dealer informed me that the car had an officially recognized defect. But somehow, Chrysler avoided having to pay the costs of fixing that issue. I contacted them directly and left extremely disappointed in their customer service.  

Drop-dead gorgeous car, but not worth the agonizing unreliability. 
Hopefully I can save others the pain.

You've been warned.

chrysler,300,2008,It's a Yawner!, 06/02/2008,Think Crown Victoria,3,"I just put 18,000 miles on a 2008 Impala LT in 6 months and swapped to the 08 300 LX, both are company fleet vehicles and equipped with fleet packages. Both cars are about the same money but the Impala handled much better. The 300 doesn't hold a center line and is very susceptible to cross winds. The Impala had more features, auto headlights, dual climate controls, flex fuel, remote start as standard. The 2.7 motor in the 300 is okay when cruising but it really works on hills. The 300 is roomier and is distinctive looking vs the rental car look of the Impala. The 300 is boring to drive think Buick LeSabre, Ford or Mercury rear drive cars. I would have rather had a hemi and sport suspension!"
chrysler,300,2008,Furyous, 05/12/2008,New owner,4,I like the car except for a couple of minor issues. I love the 4/8 cylinder switching. The power is instant when you need it. Too bad the molding was coming loose on the first day we owned it. Also the cup holders are in the stupidest place possible. If you actually put cups (even small) in them you have a hard time getting to the gear shift. The lack of a trash can or even a place to stick one in a car this big is annoying. 
chrysler,300,2008,Dale, 11/24/2007,Oh what a ride,4,What at great car love the interior and exterior. Handles like a dream great responce love to drive again.  Mileage for me is about 18 to 20 wife ranges 20 to 22 don't know why. Not bad for a hemi though. Acceleration is there when you need it the faster you go the nicer the ride.
chrysler,300,2008,Dan, 05/16/2008,Awesome vehicle,4,"Leased this beauty 2 months and 3000 miles ago-compared it to many foreign and domestic sedans before making my choice-have not regretted it for 1 minute.  Car is simply amazing to drive, and to look at.  Hemi power is as advertised-IMO, much better than the GM 4.6l northstar, or any of the high output V6's.  Size is perfect for me and my family of 3 kids.  Ride around town, or all day drives are incredibly comfortable.  Luxury items like bluetooth, nav, incredible stereo (the 370 watt stereo w/ mygig is just nuts!)  I've owned a lot of vehicles over the years-nothing I've ever  compares to this.  OK, I'm running out of adjectives!"
chrysler,300,2008,Terry, 05/22/2008,WON OVER !!!,5,"I love my Hemi. I went from an '01 Avalon to this hemi. My Avalon was a little more luxurious than my hemi, but the car handles so much better! It really turns heads!! The Avalon looks so much like the other Toyotas that people didn't know that I had a top of the line car. This one, looks, feels, and is a much better buy. Easy on the eyes and I get as much or better gas mileage as my Avalon. I was a die hard Toyota fan, but this car has changed my mind. I love it."
chrysler,300,2009,saegc7, 09/29/2010,Chrysler 300 C 2009 Heritage Edition,5,"I purchased a gold, 2009 Heritage Edition with 4017 miles on it from NC. Flew from St. Louis, MO and I drove it 883 miles home and only filled up once! The MDS kicked in for most of the trip and I got 27 mpg on the highway. Fuel economy is excellent considering the vehicle's size and weight. Acceleration is terrific and speed builds quickly. The seats are very comfortable although the view out the windows take some getting used to. Rear view is pinched to say the least. Ergonomically, the car is great as everything is right where it's supposed to be. I am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone else."
chrysler,300,2009,LitCr, 10/17/2010,Very Classy car,4,I just get at bought this car and I love it. The interior design is very up to date and comfortable. While the exterior design is very classy. I was looking to purchase a Dodge Charger but after a lot of research decided to go with the 300. I am more that pleased with my decision. I can tell you that this is a vehicle that I will have for a very long time
chrysler,300,2009,Mr. V., 07/28/2009,Muscle with Luxury,4,"I have to admit, going from a highpower two seater to this monster was quite a shock. I really enjoy getting out of a vehicle unwrinkled. I have an incredible amount of raw horsepower under the hood. I mean those fancy two seat cars are fun but no real dignity or comfort climbing in and out of one. The SRT8 not only has comfort and ease of handling but an incredible amount of space in the interior. Way to old these days to entertain in the back seat but this baby could hold an entire salesman convention party. We're talking more room in the front seat of the 300 than a Range Rover front seat.  "
chrysler,300,2009,Michael, 10/17/2010,American Car,5,"Great value!  It stands out in crowded parking lots or in traffic without the snobbery of some higher-priced European and Asian competitors.  It is fun to drive, good acceleration, and fuel economy for a large, heavy car is very good, 20-21 in town and 26-28 on the road. The 300 has comfort, ease of handling, and an incredible amount of space in the interior. Simply love the car.  Buy American."
chrysler,300,2009,Jim, 06/27/2009,excellent car,4,"I traded in my 2007 SRT Design for a 09 300c SRT8 (wish I would have purchased the SRT8 to start with) the 07 was nice but the performance increase with the 6.1 Hemi is amazing. Even at 4000+ pounds this car performs! And the looks, well, I see guys driving Mercedes checking my car out while driving down the road or at stop lights. Anyone looking for a incredibly fun car to drive and one that will get you looks from everyone else, the 300C is the car, go with SRT8 if you can afford it."
chrysler,300,2009,Laurie, 09/01/2010,Saved my families life,4,"I just bought this car less than a month ago with 25,000 Km on it.  3 days ago another driver drove flat out into the side of it (didn't even hit the brakes).  Both doors were hit.  I had the head light assembly of her car drilled into the metal of my car. The drivers door would not open after impact and there was a 1 inch gap between the drivers door and frame of the car.  Her car did not breach the interior passenger space.  The windows didn't break and I did not have side airbags either. The entire drivers side of the car is caved in and we got out alive with no cuts and no broken bones.   If we had been in a smaller car I have no doubt we would be in intensive care right now."
chrysler,300,2009,nothappy300, 06/15/2012,Bad Statement/Decision on Chryslers Part,4,last yr I purchased a 2009 Chrysler 300 Touring  love the car but when I first purchased the car I noticed that at the top of the doors there is a trim piece that had what appeared to be 2 separate pcs per door  not impressive but not a deal breaker now a yr later it appears that these are just cheap pcs as there are multiple cracks in ea. Called Chrysler and was told due to the age of the car  3 yrs  and the milage  part has NOTHING to do w/miles  I would have to pay some of the repair bill which I dont agree with. Not a seat that I ripped or stone chips I want fixed  I dont see how this is a wear and tear issue. I am truly thinking of getting rid of the car  and not purchasi
chrysler,300,2009,Ed, 11/08/2008,From 2006 Chrysler 300C to 2009 Limited,4,"Recently went from an 06 300C to an 09 300 LTD. While leaving the Hemi was disappointing the interior upgrades and overall ride are better. The LTD is missing electronic steering adjust, memmory seats and back up sensors but has better leather, LCD radio, nicer console with plentiful wood trim, soft leather covers on console and doors and other nice touches.  The real disapointment is in the smoothness of the 3.5 engine. While I knew the performance would be avaerage, it is not tight and balanced like other notable V6 engines. The 6cyl and Hemi produce equivalent mpg. Overall I'm satisfied but would love to drive an 09 Hemi with improved hp. HP is a big part of the luxury and identity."
chrysler,300,2009,Al, 12/29/2009,2009 300C AWD,4,"I bought the 300 new in June of 09.  I got the ""cool vanilla"" paint with the chrome package, and the thing is absolutely gorgeous.  I average 24.8 mpg hwy, & 16.8 mpg in city driving, which is good, considering it's a 5.7L with AWD. It has power to spare, to go with the good looks, and it handles well for a large, domestic car. It is not in the same class as the Europeans as far as handling is concerned, but for the thousands of dollars less your paying, I'd say it's a fair trade off. I'm looking forward to the 2011 model with, hopefully, some tweaks in the suspension system as well as improved fuel economy."
chrysler,300,2009,Randy, 04/06/2009,I'm Back for More.,4,"I bought one of the first redsigned 2005 Jade Green 300C's in March 2004. I thought it was an unbelievable car for the $$'s. After 70,000 miles I traded it in for the 2009 300C Clearwater Blue, fully optioned. It's a handful with  additional 19hp. It's a phenominal highway car. It has 2,000 miles on it. I just did a trip from Long Island to western Virginia. It averaged 24.1 miles/per gallon over 420 miles. Chrysler tweaked the MDS system so that it runs on 4 cylinders more often, even at 70 miles plus per hour, with a special ""ECO"" light which tells  when MDS is on. The ride is plush and heavy. Made the trip in 5:52 hours averaging 71mph. The seats are so comfortable one can drive forever"
chrysler,300,2009,Eric G, 05/13/2017,Large car with good gas mileage and comfort,4,"I've had no problems with this car. Took on one long distance trip and cruised 85 mph with no strain on engine. Tech read 2500 rpm @ 85mph. Great driving around city too!
"
chrysler,300,2009,hrisgirl, 06/20/2009,Love it but second week was not good,4,"I love this vehicle. I've got the heritage package with inferno red tintcoat so it is loaded and a real head turner. I also got a fantastic deal. I've had the car for three weeks and the second week was spent in the shop. The car suddenly stopped excelerating...over 3000 RPMs at less than 20 mph and the engine light came on. A faulty part that regulates the speed caused the car to try to shut down. It was fixed under warranty and I was told this is a one in a million defect (I hope), hence the 9 rating on build quality and reliability instead of 10. I was looking at Cadillac CTS when I came across this car. Value for the money, the 300 beats the CTS. "
chrysler,300,2009,caseykrz, 08/23/2010,Second 300,4,"Love my 300. I had a 1996 300 that I really enjoyed but I did have some trouble in the winter since my area is very hilly, and I must drive when it snows. So I did not think twice about trading it in as soon as payed off so I could buy the awd model. It has been great! My fuel mileage only went down by a hair over 1 mpg and it is great in the snow."
chrysler,300,2009,The Arb, 11/30/2009,Unbelievable Value,5,"Returned a leased 2007 300C AWD and bought this one, fearing Chrysler will not make such a big heavy powerful car again. I bought Inferno red again and it still turns heads, especially with a new Bently front grill.  I used to get a Cadillac STS every two years until 2007 when I realized this is a more beautiful car and has everything an STS has, plus much more, at a much lower price."
chrysler,300,2009,Pete, 02/16/2010,Less than pleased,3,"This car is fairly fun to drive, good acceleration, and fuel economy for a large, heavy car is good, 19-20 in town and 26-28 on the road. It has HORRIBLE ground clearance, the front air dam cannot even clear a normal 5- 6"" high wheel stop and drags when turning in to a driveway that has any kind of drainageway on the side of the road. In 5"" of snow, the bottom of the vehicle dragged. Also, the doors do not stay open if parked on the slightest angle. The color options were poor in Phoenix, there was only Cool Vanilla available with the GPS navigation option."
chrysler,300,2009,Victor, 05/01/2009,A Dream...,4,"Loved it...   after a lady crashed in to me at 65mph on the freeway I can say the impact was not little, the car is the safest I have driven and is now out and about after a $17000 repair with original parts.  I loved my 300, short after it got stolen...  I will buy one again! "
chrysler,300,2009,The Arb, 03/19/2009,Unbelievable value.,5,"With all the discounts now offered this car is an unblievable bargain. There are many improvements over the 2007 300C which I returned after a 27 month lease. This car I bought, paying 0% financing for 36 months, with nothing down. The beauty of this car, plus the inferno red color I have, is still a head turner, even though the car first appeared in 2005. From 1995 to 2007 I leased a Cadillac STS every 2 years (6 cars).  A Chrysler 300C, with options, surpasses Cadillac in every way; looks, power, performance, and most all, price.  Regarding fuel economy, you can't expect a large heavy V8 to be fuel efficient."
chrysler,300,2009,DarthXan, 04/27/2009,The 1 Reason Chrysler Should Survive!,4,"I've loved this car since it first debuted in 2005 & now I finally have 1. It's every bit as exciting as I thought it would be. Amazing power from the 5.7 L HEMI when you need it (cylinders deactivate when cruising, so it runs like a 4 cylinder to save on fuel economy). Excellent interior quality. Awesome sounding stereo. Sexy yet menacing exterior. Quietest & comfiest ride I've ever been in. Highly reccomended & right now it's still on sale. I saved almost $15K on mine! "
chrysler,300,2009,Stuckond, 06/02/2009,Fantastic car great price,5,"Low road noise, GREAT power from the 5.7, and a delicious ride from this sexy looking car.  Has all of the power of my 1970 Firebird 400 (With a rebuilt motor), and turns just as many heads.  Although I have not quite hit 1,000 miles on the 300C yet, This is without question my favorite car I've ever owned.  Very good turning radius for a big car.  At 24 HWY MPG on a brand new car, it's not awful.  In town at 16.5 could be worse."
chrysler,300,2010,Michael, 10/05/2016,Fabulous Car,5,"I bought my 2010 300 Touring eight months ago (Feb. 2016). At that time it had 70K miles. I've added another 10K, and so far the car has performed beautifully. Other than oil changes the only expense has been to buy a spare key ($315) and new tires ($700). I've taken a couple of short distance (150 miles or so) trips and the car rides like a dream. City mpg runs about 17.5-18.0; highway about 24 mpg. I feel very secure driving the car. I would recommend the Chrysler 300.

I've now owned the car for over a year and can still highly recommend the 300. It's very reliable and comfortable to drive. Only normal service work, i.e. oil changes, has been needed.

 The car now has 92,000 miles on it. Still providing perfectly reliable service. The only repair work I’ve had to do was to replace the drivers door handle. I still highly recommend a Chrysler 300.

My 300 now has over 96,000 and continues to be trouble free. Highly recommend a Chrysler 300.

chrysler,300,2010,Texan, 04/23/2010,Owner of 2nd Chrysler 300,4,"I just traded my 2005 300 for a 2010.  I made one mistake, should have gotten the 3.5 engine.  The only complaint I have is a whinning noise when using the A/C.  The buttons on the key are real easy to push by accident.  Otherwise this is a GREAT car for the money.  The price is very reasonable compared to Cadillac & others of equal size and quality.  Smooth ride & easy to drive."
chrysler,300,2010,big daddy, 07/05/2010,The car that starts itself,5,"This is my 2nd 300 with a hemi. 06 was great. Wanting to upgrade, I went to a 10 model. A great car but since purchasing in feb., has been in the shop 5 times. First time after hearing noises on sharp turns, found out that the factory had put the wrong rack and pinion steering on this model. Then the fun began. The car started itself in the garage one night at midnight. After a trip to the ownership, was told that it was fixed, it started again in the garage. Detroit told the dealer that if I had AT&T land line or computer, that it would interfere with the electronics. After 2 weeks back in the shop, was given 2 new key fobs with an AT&T blocker on them. As of 1 week, ""no Christine"""
chrysler,300,2010,carsidrive, 05/11/2013,A classic in waiting,5,"I couldn't be happier with the overall experience of this car. Just over 38k miles now, it's still brand new in every way. Power on tap is un-limited! Extremely quiet, ride is ""sporty"" for such a big car. Never feels heavy, really nimble actually. You do get jostled a bit, but when hitting curves, there's a sense they aren't even there. Talk out there in blogs has this model pinned for being collector car worthy in the future. Chrysler got it right on this one. The re-style is nice, but not comparable to this last beauty produced. Romp on it under an overpass with sunroof open and hear the twin pipes roar like a muscle car. It's a luxo freeway cruiser in supreme-sublime style and function."
chrysler,300,2010,momoracer, 12/04/2010,WOW! Perfect combo of Sport and luxury,4,"I love it. Bought it yesterday and drove 300 miles home. 24.8 mpg going 73 mph on a 5.7L V8, WOW. JOY TO THE WORLD! I test drove BMW 550i, 535i, Benz E. Almost half price as the Germans w same options, the Chrysler has better style, more comfort, the seats are great and beautiful, more room, better sound system, no-one else has the HEMI, u-connect (bluetooth) is great. Touch screen Navigation, easy to use. No scrolling through pages to get to what you need. You get SO MUCH more for your money. I love the wheels, exterior look, a great cross between the 300C and SRT. This is what I have been waiting for. Remote start, Germans can't do that? Gotta go get some milk, any excuse to drive, HA!

Since i live in the snow belt i put snow tires on it and i have no complaints in handling.My car has all options and for the money i would recommend it as one to buy. I had a 2006 SRT8 but i wanted to drive and  have the power in the winter. "
chrysler,300,2010,BK, 07/12/2010,Love the 300 S8,4,The mid year 300 S8 package is a great car with an amazing list of standard options for the price.  The interior is sporty and comfortable and all the electronic gadgets are easy to use and within reach of the driver.  Press the gas on this sleeper and you'll be quickly reminded this ain't your Daddy's Chrysler.  
chrysler,300,2010,Big Ron, 11/17/2010,Still stands out.,4,"I bought this baby right off the showroom floor.  Mine has the white exterior with the gray leather interior which all the ""Ss"" have. The options included with my S8 package are what sold me. Plus, the wheels and exterior package make it unique enough that I felt I didn't need to step up to the SRT. The HEMI more than comforts my need for power and it handles more than adequately for a car its size."

chrysler,300,2010,SupermanEmpire, 12/28/2009,Luxury for a price you can't beat!,4,"For the money, pound for pound the Chrysler 300 cannot be beat. Luxury is a word that must be aquated with this nicely presented sedan. It's styling on both the exterior and interior leave very little to want. For your buck the 300 Touring AWD edition with the 5.7 liter engine is the best of the several purchase options. It has enough umpth for your lead foot, and leaves room in your budget to add some of the best options that Chrysler offers. If you can price any other sedan in its class with exactly the same options then give it a try...I have a feeling however that you will migrate back to a car that offers the very best in style, class and luxury. 300 is still the king of the concrete."
chrysler,300,2010,Chrysler Man, 06/27/2010,World Class in Every Way!,5,"My recent ""300"" purchase made for my ninth Chrysler product in a row and this is by far the best vehicle I ever owned. I trade every three years and never thought I would get over parting with my Vanilla White Chrysler PT-Cruiser Turbo, another gem. Once I adjusted to the larger, 300 Touring Special Edition, I was thrilled with my decision to acquire this extremely roomy, powerful, compliant, well executed and stately sedan. The metallic blue I choose is stunning and turns many heads. If not for the simplification of the PT- Cruiser, I would have bought another and not realized how appealing the 300 is. I cannot wait for the all new model due out fairly soon, yet the '10 is tried and true!   "
chrysler,300,2010,scoot59, 11/01/2010,Signature Series AWD,5,I've only had it for 10 days; but I'm already in love with it. We took a trip up into the mountains with it the second day and she handles and drives like a dream. I chose the 300 because I wanted a luxury sedan capable of towing 2000 lbs. That is a short list; and the 300 is by far the best bang for the bucks; and in my opinion; the best looking of the lot. I await the 1st snowstorm to she how she does then. I'll update this post when I've got some miles on her.
chrysler,300,2010,REO, 07/31/2018,TOO LOW RIDER,3,"The front end is too low. I have torn off 2 plastic under belly pans, the entire front bumper cover on curbs and parking stops. the front end easily slides right over a parking stop upon entering a parking place. Pulls the entire belly pan or front bumper cover off when backing out. I have even replaced the 20"" stock hells with 18"" wheels so I could put a larger bias rated tire to lift the front end with no cure. I love the car, I hate to park it. NEVER VALET.

chrysler,300,2010,Byron E. Schaeffer, 04/03/2019,Das Wonderful 2010 Chrysler 300C,5,"I bought my 2010 Chrysler 200C used in November of 2015 and I am very satisfied with the car.  It is very comfortable, rides wonderfully, very quiet, and the sound system is superb.  We’ve crossed country twice in it and by the end of a full day of driving you are tired but not exhausted like with a small car.  The Hemi on the open highway is at its best when cruising at 70 and 80 miles an hour.  The comfortable seats and quietness of the car make for a pleasant trip.

Our maintenance costs have been minimal.  We are approaching 100,000 miles, I recently replaced the front struts and a sensing switch in the fuel system.  In four years other than oil changes and other routine things those are the only extra costs we’ve had.

We plan to keep the car until the 2021s come out and then purchase a new 2021 300C.

chrysler,300,2010,Scooter, 11/01/2010,Signature Series AWD,4,I've only had it a week; but absolutely love it! I needed a sedan that would tow 2000 lbs; and there are few that fit the bill. The 300 is by far the best looking of the bunch and the most affordable with great options. I choose the V6/ 5 spd for the fuel mileage and will update the post when I have some miles on it. The selling dealer was awesome to work with and would highly recommend them to anyone interested.
chrysler,300,2010,Paul Laisy, 10/11/2016,best all weather performance sedan,5,"Drive at 75 to 85 mph and consistently get 19 to 21 mpg. Excellent handling and performance.  Very capable on snow and ice with auto-4wheel drive. Love the car but am unhappy that I can not get another with v8 and awd. The newer multi-gear trans. in this car would have been very nice.  I may have to look at other brands now when I replace  this one.

chrysler,300,2010,ontario, 05/27/2010,Great ride!,4,"I actually have a 2010 300 Limited AWD 3.5L V6, the Canadian version. The MyGIG with no NAV allows up to 28 gigs of music (software, etc. takes up the remaining space). It is a great feature, easy to add music via USB and there is an aux jack as well. The vehicle's ride is great, an excellent cruiser with a superb comfort level. The vehicle is well built out of Brampton, Ontario. The dealership was pleasant to do business with, and had the vehicle delivered in a timely manner (built to order). The vehicle is very spacious (I'm 6'1"" and fit comfortably), and the AWD works wonders for harsh Canadian winters. Dual front auto climate control is a nice feature as well."
chrysler,300,2010,adamatx, 11/13/2009,Good car...in a straight line,3,"When this model came out in 2005 it was very striking, but the flashy looks are beginning to fade (PT Cruiser, anyone?). The 300 is a great highway cruiser but in any turns at 15+ mph the tires begin to squeal. The car heaves around corners like a boat and visibility makes reverse maneuvering difficult. Gas mileage is also poor at 17 city. The Impala has just as much punch, handles better, and gets 20 city/29 highway. Also, for $32k I would expect the leather to be real and not vinyl made to look like leather. When accelerating there is a brief lag between hitting the gas and the car accelerating. Most US manufacturers have this issue, would be more precise with drive by wire technology. "

The 2011 Chrysler 300 has very high build quality, everyone comments on how well made and attractive the interior of the car is. Chryslers new 3.6 V6 Pentastar is excellent, the engine is very powerfull and gets excellent gas mileage, I am averaging over 20 miles per gallon, driving around town. I have not taken my car on a long highway trip yet, but I am sure this car will easily get 30 miles a gallon on the highway on long trips. The Chrysler 300 rides extreamly smooth, is very roomy and is extreamly quiet, it is a true luxury car! Thank you Chrysler and Fiat for making such a wonderful car!"
chrysler,300,2011,robert7200, 02/05/2013,Still Simply Amazing!,5,"It has been nearly 1 year since our first review.
Our Chrysler 300C is still simply amazing. Routine service is very reasonable and no major repairs. This car still runs like it just left the showroom.
The cabin is extremely quiet and the Hemi V8 engine provides power to spare. The ride is very comfortable and the AWD option provides confidence when driving in rain or snow. Love the Alpine sound system and the Garmin Nav system is awesome. We have never really been fans of Chrysler in the past, but cannot say enough good things about the quality and comfort of our 2011 Chrysler 300C. "
chrysler,300,2011,aircray212, 11/01/2011,MY second Chrysler 300,4,"I purchased a 2006 Chrysler 300C with the hemi years ago, and loved it. The 06 300c was flooded, and I replaced it with a certified used 08benz ML500 (worst vehicle Ive owned).

After seeing the new 300, it made me miss the low maintenance, great handling, and style of my 300.
So I traded the Mercedes in last month after less than a year, and purchased a limited 300 with upgraded sound, navigation, and panoramic sunroof.
The Chryslers style, power train, and interior have won me overI get good fuel economy, smooth ride, love the huge touch screen nav, with gas, food, movie, and news finder feature through sirus.
The engine seems a little noisy At times."
chrysler,300,2011,300lvr, 09/08/2011,Kudos to Chrysler for new 300 design,4,"We've had our Chrysler 300 for about 3 months now, and we are overjoyed with the car so far. I bought it for my wife, and she fell in love with it instantly. We traded in our Honda Civic for the Chrysler 300 limited, and have no regrets. The interior design is awesome. The exterior design is marvelous, and always turn heads. We bought the brilliant black color. I love the halo-type daytime running headlights, they give the car the same luxury look as Audi and Mercedes. The 3.6 liter V6 engine is very peppy. The overall ride of the car is very comfortable. We rented this car before we bought it. I would recommend this vehicle especially if you're looking for luxury car at a good price."

I have the Tungsten grey with panaramic roof, 20"" upgraded wheels, and it's a head turner.
I have just over 3k miles on it so far and have been averaging around 20 to 21 in mostly city driving.
I drove Honda/Acura's for 20+ years and I think the options on this car for the price couldn't be beat.
I recently rented a Cadillac DTS while on vacation and think my 300's ride is much better than the Caddy and the 300's interior has better quality interior materials. Overall, the 300 feels richer than the Cadillac (IMO).
I love my 300 and am looking forward to my first road trip in it this Christmas."

Within the next few weeks, the car would not start, flashing all types of messages. A tow truck brought it to our local dealer. I am not automotive, but it was something with the wiring. Squirrels were blamed (yes, squirrels). Fixed it. A week later - no start, tow to dealer. This time the entire wiring harness needed to be replaced. Had to wait for parts.

One year in at 40k miles (I drive for a living it's my work car) I had a check engine light come on. Brought it into the dealer and found out there was damage to a valve. They refused to cover the repair even though it was nothing I had or could have done to cause this. This car was in for every oil change and service mind you.Now here I June 2014 I was on the highway at 65MPH when my car suddenly made a loud pop and locked up.I had it towed two hours back to my dealer to find out the engine had a recall on the timing chain and it had broken and blown the motor. There are no motors and they want to rebuild it after 70% catastrophic damage
chrysler,300,2011,300toll, 01/11/2012,Beautiful+Fast -- Buggy+Unreliable,2,"Beautiful american sedan with style, design, and power to draw attention!

Bad paint quality (look-up paint chipping off of hood and body panels)

Electronic Quirks (look-up problems with stereo, and blind spot system)

Reliability Issues (see popular quality awards)

Poor Build Quality (look-up issues with front lights pooling water, and problems with powertrain)

The negative problems and Chrysler's continued lack of attention to quality and consumer preference unfortunately far outweigh the beauty and power."
chrysler,300,2011,grandpappy, 10/07/2013,Balky Transmission,4,"First of all, I love this car.. it's so much fun to drive and folks love to talk to me about its looks... The one problem is the transmission. It bumps occasionally and three times it has seemed to go into neutral while pulling out to pass on the highway.. all three times it seems as though the engine has stall but that can't be the case since the power steering still works.. It's the transmission.. As a retired professional drive, I am able to keep calm when this occurs but my wife would be lost and may have a serious wreck had it happened to her.. The first time the dealer said it was a software glitch and needed updating.. the two time sinve, they say they can't find anything. "
chrysler,300,2011,300andsad, 02/01/2012,Terrible Overall Quality,2,"Concur with the other review. Handsome vehicle, but loaded with quality and electronic problems.

1) Paint chipping on many areas
2) Remote key-less system failed and car would not start
3) Numerous rattles
4) Safety concerns with the blind spot & rain-sensing wipers: do not properly work and thus cause dangerous conditions
5) Severe engine shudder

Leased in Sept 2011 and have regretted it since then. Dealership has been pretty solid, but Chrysler is a mess."

However, after test driving the new 300C, it was hard to deny the great improvement in quality, fit and finish. The 300C is equipped with every possible option including the 363HP Hemi V8, all-wheel drive, adaptive cruise control, lane change warning, park assist, back-up camera, Garmin nav system, bluetooth and ipod adapter, heated and cooled seats, heated steering wheel, napa leather seats, real wood trim, panoramic moon roof, and more.

With a little over 21,700 miles on the odometer, we are still very happy with our 300C.
This car continues to ride smooth and quite and has power to spare.
We also continue to receive compliments on the look of this beautiful car.
One could easily spend $30K more for one of the so-called higher class vehicles, but we really do not see the benefit.
If you are looking for a full size, 4-door sedan, we highly recommend the Chrysler 300C."

This is Dec. 7, 2011 and I am still waiting on a new transmission. It seems that Chrysler does not stock this transmission and you have to wait 2-3 weeks to get it. The dates of delivery that the dealer gets are not accurate and as the owner I cannot talk to anyone with Chrysler that knows any thing about when the parts will arrive. We love the car, the ride is like air, has plenty of room, got 28.5 mph on the last road trip."

She likes brash American sedans, and while we liked the new Taurus, I encouraged her to drive the new 300 based upon the reviews I've read thus far.
We have owned the car for two weeks and this review summarizes our early findings."
chrysler,300,2011,1atomic, 06/05/2011,Owner of both a Chrysler 300 Limited and Dodge Charger R/T with AWD,5,"It is highly unusual for our family to purchase two new vehicles in the same calendar year, but with the lease up on my previous 300C and having over 120,000 miles on my wife's '08 Dodge Magnum R/T, we laid the cards out on the table at our regional Chrysler-Jeep-Dodge-Ram dealership and came away with an incredible deal on both vehicles ordered together. The 2011 Chrysler 300 Limited is the way to go, IMO, as it is the most luxurious vehicle in its class for just over $33,000 loaded! With its standard Pentastar V6 with V8-like power and 4-cylinder gas mileage, i knew immediately that this was the sedan for me. I do not miss the Hemi-V8 of my 2006 300C, but happy to have a choice. Great buy!"
chrysler,300,2011,bobp11, 04/28/2011,Amazing,5,"I ordered a V-6 Limited version with luxury and safety packages. Went for the big 20 inch wheels and upgraded sound system too. This car is by far the finest I have ever owned and driven in its class. It has power, is very quiet, handles great, and is loaded with a lot of electronic features. The exterior styling along with the LED daytime running lights are exceptional. The sounds system also rocks! My 17 year old son even likes it and says the big wheels make the car look very sporty, yet executive like. It rides like a dream and I'm getting much better than advertised gas mileage so far - about 25 in mixed driving and 31+ on the highway. I have nothing negative to report about the new 300"

Power, comfort and quiet are the hallmark of this beautiful 4-door E class sedan. Its built on a Mercedes E-class platform and delivers every bit of the E-class quality one would expect. Its packed with every imaginable option and drives like a dream. We still love our Chrysler 300C and can highly recommend it to anyone shopping for a large, quality 4-door sedan.

At first Chrysler was not even going to cover the repairs under warranty, but then relented after two weeks and no fix yet. Now as of today it just needs new software. 

When I get this car back (if I do) I have a mind to paint it lemon yellow and add a sign advertising for Chrysler lemonade.

In the time I’ve had it I’ve had to replace the A/C compressor not once but twice along with the list goes on like radiator fans engine and oil cooler power steering pump. Oil sensor pressure switch (twice) all lower control arms thermostat transmission shift solenoids and probably a couple other things I can remember at the moment 
chrysler,300,2012,nOrakat, 07/19/2016,So finally I write my in depth review..,3,"So finally I write my in depth review after owning the car for over 3 years, from brand new in 2012. I am a professional Livery driver and spent many hours in this car. First the best aspects of the car: -Even with my 3.6L engine, this car is fast and I think this is what the designers focused on mostly; never had a car that peeled out before. Great torque and fairly responsive. The torque also allows the car to get up to speed without revving too high so in that sense the engine is quiet. Exhaust is quiet. Transmission is fairly good with some inconsistencies and quirks.  Car is large and roomy (except for maybe the ceiling height) and passengers in the back comment often on how comfortable it is back there. Now some bad: My biggest gripe about this car is the suspension. It feels OK over small bumps but it feels like you crashed into a truck if you hit a small pothole or go over bad roads which are numerous here in NYC. The suspension is unrefined, but still better than my friends Cadillac XTS which also has a horrible suspension. The build of this car is not very good. Pieces vibrating, creaking sounds coming from the rear and my sunroof, ceiling and other places, which gives the impression that it is *not* a solid car. Even the right side of my top panel, next to my windshield keeps popping up. This in combination with the feeling of the harsh suspension makes it feel like the car is falling apart. For the few years I have owned this car, I had tons of trouble. I had to change the battery twice, the entire front suspension, rear shocks, water pump, fuel pump, and a bunch of other minor problems. The suspension being the most costly. My airbag light goes on and off. The rear windows screech as they go up and down. Anyway, you get the point. The entertainment and touch control system is great, I like the screen size and the way it works. However my Bluetooth connection stopped working and I cannot connect my phone anymore. Sound system is very decent. Sunroof is great and can vent it without the rain pouring in. Wheels are fake chrome with a plastic facade. Steering wheel is just ok and can hurt the hands after a while. Leather seats are decent, with a solid base but still a bit unrefined; can still sit comfortably for a long time. Still a great deal if you get close to the base model price with a warranty which is close to the price of a Camry. Would still rather own this car over a Camry and other similar price range cars any day.

I went to the dealer not expecting much, but after test dricing the 300S version, I was hooked and drove him with it that night.
It's very quick and it gets an amazing 30 MPG highway.
It's very quiet inside and the BEATS audio system is excellent.

I paid $22,612 for the base model with the 8 speed transmission at Orange Coast Chrysler in Costa Mesa.
I like the keyless entry and startup. The seats are very comfortable with multiple power adjustments.The ride is smooth , but not sporty. That said, it maneuvers very well for such alarge car.

But after reading the negative reviews on the transmission i decided to give our good 'ol American Chrysler a try, and boy........I was blown away. You really never appreciate a good car till you own one. Ever since i got the car, i've been looking for an excuse to drive to somewhere.... anywhere. To feel the growl of that V8 engine. The interior is classy and spacious. The navigation is the easiest i've seen in a vehicle. 

Bottom line is that this is one of the best cars for the money out there. I'm totally content with my buy. 

If you're looking for a large sedan, give the 300 a try. You wouldn't regret you did."

I have averaged 32.5 mpg total for 2000 miles, in and out of town and It will really go if you need it. I swore I would never buy a Chrysler product again 20 years ago. What a car!

Pentastar coupled with the new 8 speed tranny can best 25 mpg city and 40 on the highway when cruising and still as nearly 30 horsepower to pass by turtles when necessary. The insides are on par with ANY other luxury car.
I have the S package with in my opinion looks bit better, bigger tires, blacked out grill and bezels in lights, paddle shifters, and bucket seats. But the limited is no slouch with standard leather and rearview camera.
The ride is quiet. I just can't believe how well this car is put together. Premium cloth seats are truly premium!What a car!"

My cars before that were Infiniti M35, Lexus GS430, BMW 540 sport.
This car is better than them all.
Harmon Kardon Sound blows away all of the rest.
The balance of ride, handling and comfort is superior.
The 5.7 liter Hemi has better performance that all of them.
Only the 540 comes close, but still not as good.
What a value, with a car like this on the market for 45,000; why would anyone spend 40 grand more for a LS460 or BMW 550?"

I have owned GM products since I was 16.
If this car has the longevity I think it will, I will be a loyal Chrysler owner.

I'm 50 & 6'4"" tall and 300 lbs; I'm not a small man so my choices in a new car are limited.
I have been driving SUV's for the last 20 years and wanted a car this time for better fuel economy. I like the fact it's not a young person's car.

The 300 is a godsend.
I own a 06 Lucerne.
It's a nice car but the angle of top side of the car reduces shoulder room.

So, I went down to the dealership and drove the beast.
I actually went down to drive the SRT, but when I learned the S has 300 HP and gets 32 MPG, I couldnt resist.
It drives extremely quiet down the road and the extra gear transmission really makes a difference.

I've owned a lot of cars in my life and I've been more satisfied with this purchase than almost anything else I've owned.  I think a lot of that feeling gets down to the $$$ paid for what I've received in return. The styling, comfort, economy, etc are just about a perfect mix.  I really cannot fault the car for much of anything.   I was lucky enough to find a 2011 in 2013 with only 4900 miles on the odometer and paid roughly $22K for a car that had listed for $40K  new.   I doubt that I would take $22K for it today. What would I replace it with? I still own the car - over 5 1/2 years now with just 33,000 miles clocked so far. Have been thinking about buying a newer car but cannot make myself do it. I love this car.

Not wanting to beat my Lexus GS450h up on the winding, dipping, bumpy 2 lane 280 mile drive loaded with semi-tractor trailer commerce and lines of traffic, at first I rented. 
That proved less than satisfactory, so I began looking for a vehicle that was comfortable, good on gas, equipped with spirited engine to pass the big rigs, some convenience features plus a decent sound system and, of course, competitive price. 
And I was determined to land on made in America."

1. This is the first car I've owned manufactured by one of America's Big 3. 
2. I've never owned a car that didn't have a clutch, and this was a real hurdle concerning the ""fun-to-drive"" factor.
3. I loved the interior of my last vehicle, an Audi A6.
I was surrounded by real leather and wood, not the disgusting plastic so prevalent in today's cars.

My 300 Luxury Series (Pentastar V6 mated with the ZF 8-speed) truly lives up to its name.

This is our 4th Chrysler between me and my girlfriend and this 300 hasn't failed us yet. Previously I owned and 1999 Chrysler LHS (Brought it in 2001), an 1999 300m and a she had 2006 Dodge Charger R/T purchased in 2007. The 2012 Chrysler 300 Limited hasn't had not one issue and it has 68,000 miles on it. It has on had oil changes and brakes. The brakes took 3 years to wear down. We room a road trip in it from Chicago to Bloomington, Mn and I reset the fuel data to see how many mpg the 300 got per gallon. We filled up the tank and made it to Minnesota with 3/8 of a tank of gas left. The mpg read at 39.3 which blew my socks off. I used cruise control almost all of the trip that's probably why but the vehicle is also comfortable and can seat 5 adults. It glides through traffic and the engine is powerful. This was a great choice because I have friends that own Toyota Camry's (ignition coil issues $1900 to repair and Variable valve timing problems $2,200 repair) and Honda Accords and they have had major problems and constant recalls. The 300 has little to no road noise and the interior design is a thousand times better than those boring Asian interiors. I love this car and will purchase another vehicle in the Chrysler family (HellCat) in the near future.

We went to look for a MB with same features and could not find one with features of the 300c with out costing us a arm and a leg and our grand kids! Wow! REAL WOOD, REAL LEATHER DASH.

chrysler,300,2012,Bob Van Ess, 07/24/2019,AWD 2012 Chrysler 300,3,"I bought the car in 2019, kept it 6 months. I think the styling is awesome the main reason I bought the car. Seats are comfortable and car is quiet. I don't know if it's the all-wheel drive or not but I find the ride to be too firm, feeling just about every bump for a car this size and I made sure the tires were 30 lb PSI to soften it up. I would have preferred a plush ride. Quite a few mechanical problems lowered my score for this car such as cruise control worked on and off. All of a sudden there was an error with the all-wheel-drive that said it had to be serviced. Once that happened, everything else seemed to be connected to it so nothing else worked.  No more cruise control no anti-lock or traction control or blind spot protection. Apparently when that light popped on about the all-wheel-drive being serviced, everything else went out with it. I wasn't going to get into repairing that, sold the car. One thing I noticed is, it was a [non-permissible content removed] to close the door when you're sitting in the car, you can't reach the handle. Also when you go to open the drivers door if you don't push it open with just right amount of force, the door closes back on you. The infotainment Center is okay but not great and sort of a nuisance how you have to open a different window and then choose airflow if you are looking at the radio on the screen. But they put a hard AC button down below. Why didn't they just put a hard air flow direction button down there so you don't have to fiddle with the touch screen. The gas pedal is a little weird in that you get a delayed reaction when you accelerate.  I don't know if it's an electronic gas pedal or what but that sort of sucks.

Our dilemma now is whether to buy an extended warranty or not, and if so, from whom to purchase it.

I cant say enough good things about the quality and reliability of the 2013 Chrysler 300S. I test drive the Hemi, which was my preference at the time, and decided the difference in power from the V6 was so negligible that it wasn't justified. I actually had to ask the salesman if he was sure I was in the V6 at the time because of how well the power delivery was. Plus the 31mpg highway rating is a conservative estimate.

The front windshield is extremely pitted after only 34k miles! aerodynamics? cheap glass?  ( I do not tailgate). At the current pace, I will have to replace it by 50k miles.

*update June 28 2016:  I have owned this Chrysler 300 for a little over 2 years, and 45,000 miles.  It has spent way too much time at the Dealer for major repairs. And getting the repairs made are extremely frustrating.  Apparently, Chrysler does not like to acknowledge defects.  My entire Dash had to be removed to repair a faulty climate control system.  This was only completed after 2 prior visits, where I was told that the system was working per ""Chrysler specs"".  And then the Transmission!  Oh Boy!  This started early on, maybe after just 10,000 miles,  It was shifting quite roughly, sometimes not knowing what gear to go into.. and heavy clunking (like a bad U-joint on an older model car).  Numerous complaints and visits to the dealer, just to be told that the mechanics found it within ""Chrysler Specs"".  The car was recently at the dealer for 5 weeks (5/16/201 - 6/21/2016), waiting on a NEW TRANSMISSION.  And I seriously doubt that my troubles are over...

Launch Control is touchy and aborts unless on a perfect and flat surface, otherwise get ready for a wonderful rear tire smokey show while impressive; it cuts the 1/4 mile and 0-60 time to about 12.5 quarter mile and 4.3 for a  0-60 with junky stock tires, get good tires and this car will be with the big leagues at the time trap. For older people this car may be too much to hang on to in Track Mode while on the normal road. 170 MPH seems like a cruising 80  MPH in this fine ride.And  this is where you leave your neighbor (who had to go get a raise at work to own a Buick), you can pass him up  and leave him far behind, and probably pump the same amount of gas as he does. You just get there first with a lot more flash ! This car never gets compared to a Buick unless you have the 3.6L then by chance... and even then just MAYBE.

chrysler,300,2013,leasingman, 02/05/2013,Full-size American Luxury Car,5,"For three months, I've had a 2013 300S with the red leather interior, sunroof, nav, and tech package. This is a full-size luxury car with surprisingly good handling for its size and lots of room, and the S model adds an extra flare of style. Don't bother with the cost of the hemi V-8. The V-6 has 300 horsepower (plenty of power for all driving and a little playing) and with the 8-speed transmission I get the advertised 31 mpg on the highway. I've got the rear wheel drive version. You can't beat that for full-size luxury. The Beats by Dre sound system is awesome and it has THE best and biggest touch screen in the industry, hands down. I don't regret this purchase for one second."
chrysler,300,2013,freddiegee, 05/21/2013,American Steel,5,"The 300C Lux is absolutely a great driving machine. If you are looking for a yuppie-mobile or pretty-boy car, go elsewhere. This car oozes American masculinity. Excellent road manners, extremely comfortable and quiet and loaded with the tech goodie you'll want.

This car is roomy and has a large presence. I bought mine with the Hemi, but the Pentastar is a great engine for those wanting better mileage.

You couldn't even think of buying a 5 series, E Class, Lex or A6 unless your just after the badge. And willing to pay 10-25 thousand more for equivalent equipment with less room."
chrysler,300,2013,Mike Ellis, 02/08/2016,Great car for Road Trips,5,"After owning this car for almost 18 months I have nothing but praise for it. I currently own a 2013 Chrysler 300S AWD with the Hemi option and use it for business. I travel throughout the Midwest and have not found a more comfortable, eye catching car yet. The ride is comfortable without feeling like your grandpa's old Buick. Although it is not a sports car, I can keep up with the best of them. The fuel mileage is not stellar since it is a large AWD car with a powerful V8, however, it is reasonable. I was on the fence before buying this car and would HIGHLY recommend this car!

The 2013 Chrylser 300 is a pleasure to drive.


It is so very quiet and smooth!
More so than my 2011 Honda Odyssey van (that has been plagued with problems).
The base model does exhibit a bit of ""floatiness"", which is attributed to the smooth and quiet ride.
But it's not a negative.

Compared to most cars on the market, it has a lot of room, especially in the rear passenger area.
Wish it had more in the driver's area for big guys like me.


For me, buying the base model and adding fog lamps and O.E.M 20"" custom wheels to a car that was already feature rich... made sense!

chrysler,300,2014,oldcarguy, 02/04/2014,Buy it!!,5,"I spent a couple months reading reviews and shopping around. I needed a sedan with room for me ( I'm 6'3"") and my two young kids. I test drove the V6 Honda Accord, Nissan Maxima, 2014 Chevy Impala, and a couple Buicks. I didn't even consider the 300 until it came up in a couple other car reviews - I thought they were much more expensive. I bought a 2014 300C with the Hemi V-8 (NOT V-6 as the Edmund's site insists) and the SafetyTec package and cannot convey how much I love this car! It reminds me of several old American luxury muscle cars I've owned, crossed with the most modern technology, comfort, and quality. It's as if my 1971 455 Grand Prix SJ had a baby with the Starship Enterprise. (In a good way!) Buy one!
**update** I have now owned the car for years and I still love it. No problems at all. It is still the best of both worlds: American V-8 sound and power, German-engineered chassis. Best car I have ever owned. I plan to keep it for years and years.
**Second update Feb 2020** 60,000 trouble free miles, still looks like new and drives like new. Still happy with this car. If it were stolen I would replace it with the exact same model today.

chrysler,300,2014,vakmere1, 10/03/2014,Not to shabby-revised,4,"This review is revised now that I have owned the car for 2 years. What I do not like about the car is  the creaky dashboard  creaky door panels  the armrest is too high some panel trim not lined up correctly and the seats are too narrow. Under warranty so far I have replaced  the windshield cowl  the right rear shock  the rear sunscreen . Fuel economy is average. Traction is non-existent in the snow. This is not all wheel drive. The rest is the original review I did two years ago and still stands. Traded in a pristine 2011 Buick Lacrosse without batting an eye. Finally, a big car that rides with the comfort I have not had in years. The fact that it is rear wheel drive lets the front suspension do its job by handling road imperfections very well. Not much wind or road noise in the cabin either. Some feedback from the road can be felt in the steering wheel however it doesnt have that annoying torque steer like front wheel drive cars. Garmin nav system is better than Onstar hands down and without the monthly fee. Very little clutter on the dash which makes for a cleaner look. Go for the loaded version if you can because with the base model you will be missing out.

chrysler,300,2014,Jim, 11/29/2017,Nice ride horrible transmission!,2,"Purchased the car used with 4500 miles on it and only had it a year and sold it with 26k miles.  During this time the ride of the car was outstanding, very smooth with very little road noise and a great interior with everything in reach.  The AWD was the best I have driven in the western new York snow.  However, there were a few things that were pretty annoying about the car.  First, if you were using the navigation system, it would just start to reset itself at the most inopportune time for no reason.  Once the navigation came back on it would pick right up where you were and continue.  Second, the heated seats is not a button, you have to go onto the display into climate and press the heated seat.  I would expect it to be a button right there on the dash or gear shifter area (petty I know).  Third and most important, the transmission is horrible.  I had the car in the shop 3 times during the year of ownership because of the shifting of the car.  
The first issue with the transmission was first thing after starting it.  The car would rev up and finally shift into third gear with a very heavy shift, into the shop for a reprogram of the transmission.  Service tech at the dealer says that this is common with the car and they need to re-program to learn your driving style.  It was fixed and no issues for 3 months.  Second issue came when I started to slow down.  Every time I would come to a stop  the car would jerk forward on every down shift.  Back into the shop again for a reprogram for a fix.  That one lasted 3 months and then another issue came up while driving at highway speeds, while traveling 65 plus MPH the transmission would decide to down shift for no reason and then after about 5 min would go back into 8th gear.  Back to the shop for that, and the comment by the tech was “this is odd never heard of the highway speed issue, the other two are known issues”.  Good bye car before the warranty expired.  
The transmission ruined the entire car experience (duh).  The car is beautiful and comfortable inside, great features for a “base” car and it was depressing to have to trade in, but the transmission issues would have cost $450 to reprogram outside of the warranty; no thank you.

you get a lot for the money and you feel like a MILLION BUCKS. The BASE trim is a true luxury car.

chrysler,300,2014,vakmere1, 08/22/2014,Not bad - details could be better,4,"Re-issued this review on 8/22/2016. My review now is: I have the safety-tech package and it works flawlessly so far. The city ride could be softer, there is some road feedback thru the steering wheel (has 18"" tires), the rear sunshade was replaced once because it spooled up and tangled. 6 months later it did it again. Right rear shock leaked, failed, was replaced. Windshield wiper cowl was replaced (warped out of shape), IMO the front seats could be wider by 2.5 inches. I use a seat cushion. The dash board and rear right door creaks over rougher surfaces and is annoying to hear.  U-Connect and Nav features are good. Map updates are expensive and I don't think worth the money unless you travel other cities often. The center arm rest is too high for me. USB port could be located outside the center storage area for easier access. City gas mileage is average. Shifter is finicky and one needs to pay attention to its position when parking. It rolled on me a couple times when I thought it was in PARK and there is a recall for this issue. I looked at the 2016 300C and think my 2014 300C is better due to looks and interior colors. Don't know why the new ones come with white seats, will dirty quickly. As a long distance cruiser my 2014 300C is a very good ride and gas mileage on the highway is better than average. 

Original review:
Got this in June 2014. Gladly traded a 2011 Buick Lacrappe for this car. This 300C has a great ride, good accelleration, very little road noise, coushy heated and cooled seats, and handles road imperfections especially around Philly well but could do better. Gas milage is excellent as long as you dont pound the pedal. Mine has all the bells and whistles. 
On the down side there were interior trim detail items that should not have been there. Moulding doesnt line up in some spots along the dash, some dashboard noise going over some bumps. Cowl over the speedometer was loose. Shifter needs practice to get used to. Other than that this is a very good purchase. Too soon to tell if it has mechanical issues.

This was probably the best car I have owned. which exceeds 30 cars and trucks. Fast, nimble and most of all reliable. I purchased a 2018 Volvo S90 T5 AWD for my business (300 was also used for business) and it is junk! Warped rotors, front and rear at 11K only gets 28 MPG's and its a 4 cyl. Pretty car, sexy too...but regret my purchase! I am considering a new 2020 Chrysler 300 for replacement. 300 has the best bang for the buck IMO! Hoping for better leather, Headlights and 20' wheels.

chrysler,300,2015,Scott G., 07/30/2016,Outstanding,5,"I think this is an exceptional Sedan. Thick wrapped leather steering wheel, large leather seats and plenty of cargo room in the trunk. I look forward to driving this car everyday with it's crisp handling, supple ride and near perfect engine/transmission combo. The base stereo in our Limited has more features and better bass response than any other vehicle we have ever owned. The rotary shifter does take a little getting used to, but is a non-issue and actually makes the center stack feel a little more spacious. This car certainly has it's limits in the corners, but is far more nimble then given credit. Yes the transmission is programmed for fuel economy,  yet it responds quickly to downshifts and will hold a gear when summoned to. If you do any mixed driving like me expect 27-29 MPG, if you drive strictly around town like my wife you will be in the 22-24 MPG range. If you drive hard, all bets are off and fuel economy should not matter to you. I am extremely impressed with the fuel economy for a car this big and heavy. Chrysler dealers are willing to negotiate on these vehicles, especially the RWD V6 models like ours and that just sweetens the pot even more. I was also impressed with it's winter handling here in Michigan, it felt planted and traction was decent on really bad roads with the stock Michelin's. I had Discount Tire put 4 Hankook iPike winter tires on my wife's car and we could practically conquer the world in this thing. Test drive one and you will be impressed.

chrysler,300,2015,Mariah B, 04/24/2016,Amazing! Top of the Line,5,"I bought this car after my 2015 Dodge Durango Limited was totaled by a drunk driver. My number 1 necessity was to feel safe in a vehicle again.. The Durango save my life, my husband's life, my 1 month old son's life, my toddler's life and my best friend's life. I really wanted another one but at the time these were still new so there were no used Durangos and I did not have the same amount of money to put down that I had previously. So I had no choice but to take a higher payment or get a cheaper car... so I chose to buy the 2015 Chrysler 300s -V6. 

Let me tell you.. this car does not even compare to any other sedan out there! I have driven Nissan, Toyota, Honda, Chevy, BMW and Mercedes. This car is by far more comfortable and smooth than any of the vehicles listed above!! I miss my Durango every day especially because we have 2 kids, 2 dogs and the 2 of us. We manage to squeeze all of us and the dogs in our 300 but it would be nice to have the SUV again. I have contemplated many times over the 10 months that I have had this car on trading it in for a used SUV. But the amount of money I paid, my car payment and the luxury this car has does not compare to the cars I would qualify for. I AM NEVER TRADING THIS IN!

I get pretty good MPG, although my Altima got almost 10 more MPG in City and Highway. I do wish the backseats had a better AC vent system. They are behind the center console so when its 110 degrees outside it takes a minute for the back to get cooled down and when someone is sitting in the middle their knees will freeze off before either sides will feel air. This car rides like a cloud, the stock speakers are better than regular (Beats Audio), I have tinted windows and I get so many compliments on my car. 

I highly recommend this car to anyone! I have the V6 and in sport mode I have raced a street bike, a Lexus sportscar, and a couple others. It has speed, comfort-ability, luxury, and it is one heavy vehicle!  I feel safe in this car and I have confidence driving down the road. The remote start and trunk lift are really awesome! The only flaw is sometimes when you turn the car on with the key and open the trunk from the inside of the car the truck wont close, it pops back up until the car is put into drive, which sucks if you're alone. It is a mechanical/safety concern but it was a glitch and I have not had a problem since. 

DO NOT BUY THIS CAR IF... if you want space or have 3 car seats! The backseat is large but the two side bucket type seats are perfect for car seats, the middle is too narrow.  All in all, this car is a 5 out of 5!

chrysler,300,2015,Anthony, 09/27/2016,Wow.,5,"I am a life-long Infiniti and Lexus owner. I always buy a car that is at least 1 or 2 years old, so I don't get hit with the depreciation the last poster was complaining about on new cars. Test drove and researched many pre-owed vehicles (including Lexus LS, Infiniti Q70, Benz S, BMW 7, Audi A8) before deciding on a low mileage pre-owned 300c AWD v6 for my next car. To say I'm impressed after 500 miles would be an understatement. It is truly the best combo of comfort, performance, safety AND value. Those were my priorities, and this car knocks the ball out of the park. I wanted and found a 300c with the SafetyTec2 Package with adaptive cruise. After using this option for a bit, I wonder how I ever survived without it. It makes driving even more of a pleasure in this car. If you are considering pre-owned in those other big European sedans, do your research... right here on Edmunds. Reliability issues and quirky problems abound in those cars. Even if you pay a fortune for an extended warranty, you'll likely be inconvenienced with multiple trips to the dealership for repairs. Side note: I purchased a Chrysler manufacturer's bumper-to-bumper extended warranty to cover me up to 7 years and 75k miles.... for $1300. Try to get a price for that warranty on one of those Euro sedans. You'll be lucky if you only pay 3x as much. The 300 was also by far the least expensive of all vehicles I tested.
"
chrysler,300,2015,Steve, 08/24/2015,Far better than ever expected,5,"I was in the market for a German Midsize Sedan.   I test drove the BMW 328i, Audi A4, and the Mercedes CLA250 and C250.    My wife asked me if I had any other cars on my list and I said ""yeah, the Chrysler 300 but I don't think it'll hold up against the other 3 we drove"".  My wife convinced me to go drive it since it was on the list.   We didn't even get 1/4 mile and we both were simply blown away!

The Chrysler 300 for some strange reason is compared to other American sedans and a Japanese sedan or two, but for some reason they are rarely compared to the 3 Euro models I listed above.  Why?  I have no clue other than it might be political because the 300 puts them to shame.   Yeah, the others have a couple interior things that look a bit better (not by much and prob not noticeable by most people) but when you compare the engine, the ride, the bang for your buck it's not even a comparison.

Once we were done test driving the 300 it was a easy decision, we weren't going to spend $5k-$10k more just to have the BMW, Audi, or Mercedes name on our car.....we wanted the best riding, most spacious, and most upgrades we could get and save $5k-$10k!

We ended up getting the 2015 300S in Black and absolutely LOVING IT!!!

Finger tip paddle shifters, along with the avionics and convenient placing of switches and displays makes this vehicle a pleasure to motor in. Driving I find relaxing and this 2015 300C does not disappoint. Great turning radius  makes for ease in maneuvering this luxury car at a great price.

chrysler,300,2015,Tim C., 01/04/2016,"Good car, but.......",3,"Bought my 2015 Platinum AWD new and have mixed feelings. Ride, handling, and features are very good. Love the styling, both inside and out; controls are very logical and easily understood. Handling and performance are good for what this car is. My biggest disappointments with this vehicle are as follows.
1) Backup camera guidelines are off about a foot to the left side when backing straight up. Took it back to the dealer twice, once after getting Chrysler Customer Service involved. I was told that this is normal, and due to the lens being mounted off centered on the real center mounted light. I've owned cars costing half as much and never had an issue like this with the rear guidelines. My previous 300 had the same setup with the rear camera (although I was told it was mounted directly in the center of the vehicle!) and I did not have this issue. 2) The navigation system seems to be rather mundane, especially the display in the center drivers information area that shows the turn coming up-it is always the same graphic, regardless of the actual intersection you are approaching. For the price of the nav system, it really should be much better. 3) There is an annoying rattle somewhere in the backseat area that no one seems to be able to eliminate.

chrysler,300,2015,dobberdawg, 05/02/2015,Don't Tell My 2015 300 It Isn't a Luxury Car...,5,"and don't tell me either.  Took Delv mid-April.  Ordered 300c with Tech 1 & 2 and Lght gp 18"" tires for comfort.  Immed took it on 1000 mile trip. Drove better than any luxury car I've driven and they are many.Has ANY thing you can get on any car but in a much simpler format.I traded a twice the price luxury car for this and I got the better of the deal.Highs: Seats, radio, noise suppression, smoothest cruise control avail you don't even know when it goes in and out.  No 'clunk' like others, MPG, seats have room under them so no more lost credit cards.Lows:________, and _______ and _______ and I can't think of any more lows.  Perhaps more interior color choices... 

UPDATE 2016 One year of driving: After driving for a year I still love it but a couple of items reared their ugly head....(1)  The Bluetooth just conked out today...received a txt and it made a funny noise and disconnected the phone and I could not reconnect.  Also tried a  couple other phones when I got home and they would  not connect either.  Noticed the other day it dropped the signal strength meter and showed 0 signal.  It would ring the phone first when receiving a call and then ring through the car and was  very confusing.   Oh, by-the-way don't bother going to UconnectPhone.com.  It  only helps on 2011 models. Duh!  Chrysler please update your stuff.   (2)  Now for the environmental controls.  Once set to the desired temp it does cool the car but then looses its setting someway.  i have to constantly adjust the temp. (3)  Ride, quietness, smoothness, mpg are all great.  Great car just have to correct the above.  I would still  buy this car again!

UPDATE NOVEMBER 2018:  Now have 52,000 miles and would not change any of the above.  One would think at 3 years old and this millage the car would be showing age signs such as rattles and squeaks........nope, just like the day I drove it home.  One thing did cost a bundle ($850) which was a leak in the AC at the compressor.   But even with that I would rather have this car than any other.  I only change the oil according to the oil life meter on the car which amounts to around every 9,000 miles.  Hey, this just might be the last car I buy!  Until the next requested update..........

It is the best car that I have owned by far and I have owned a lot of cars.  So far, I love all the features and even though, it is a heavy car, it handles, accelerates and brakes extremely well. For a car this heavy, it handles like a lighter car. It is a very smooth and the drive is great.  I see a lot of people looking at it. This car has an attitude like no other car out there.

chrysler,300,2015,throw73, 09/19/2016,Poor beneath the surface,1,"I purchased a 2015 300c 5.7l v8 hemi brand new. First, the cars seat comfort is excellent. The cars driver side seat ventilator motor gave out on its first use. If you want a smooth quiet ride I would avoid the 20"" wheels, they are very noisy. The 5.7 hemi is fast but by todays standards not really... Plus the tradeoff of horrible gas mileage. What people who don't own one don't really know is that you have to get the rpm's pretty high in order to take advantage of the torque on the 5.7.   I waited for the 2015 model so that I could get the 8-speed transmission. The shifts are jerky and inconsistent which was a concern but livable. Also when moving to 'drive' from 'reverse' and vise versa there is a loud pop when engaging into the gear. The big problem occurred when I was trying to merge on the freeway and under semi hard acceleration the transmission popped into neutral, then downshifted to a gear too low causing a major jerk reaction. I almost got rear ended because of this. This was all before the first oil change at around 8000 miles( the minor issues were present from the beginning). When I took the car in to the dealer they performed a bunch of computer updates. This did not fix the issue and the car did the same thing upon merging on the freeway again. Second trip to the dealer they had to replace the valve body. This car was just bought back from Chrylser through the lemon law. This car is garbage. Which is reflected in the resale value. May car was worth ~$25,000 in less than 1 year with low miles, I purchased it for $40,000! I did research and the Chrysler 300 is #1 in depreciation! This is why you see so many wankstas in used 300's. Save yourself and your wallet from this car and learn from my experience.

chrysler,300,2015,Tom, 01/24/2019,A well done & modern Chrysler 300 design.,4,"Chrysler originally introduced the 300 model as large luxury performance model in the 1950's.  I had owned a 1967 300.  There wasn't an entry for a V8 option for the 300c Platinum.  Mine has this option.  Plenty of strong acceleration and effortless highway cruising.  I gave up approximately 2 mpg for this option and haven't regretted it.  I especially like need not for the transmission to shift so frequently as the V6.   Although the V6 is more than adequate for day to day driving.  The ride is very smooth and given the car's weight of over 4,000 pounds and size, handling is precise and secure.  This car is a boulevard cruiser.  This is a very easy car to drive.  Especially with the safety tech features.  With the front/rear/blind spot sensors the styling or somewhat modest visibility is well compensated for.  The interior is well finished and does well for low noise.  Like so many cars nowadays, tire/road noise is slightly noticeable.

Great sound but there is only one control for it - a dial on the control panel.  No steering wheel control for the volume and no tone control anywhere.  Crazy!  I may just be me on the comfort of the seats but, they are not made for long distance travel.  At first I thought it was me but on two different 1,000+ mile trips with different passengers on the passenger side experienced what I did - cramping in thigh/hamstring area and sore butt.  No changing of angle nor height of seat base helped.  Now the low lites and only part of them.  Every week or two another little bug rears its' ugly and costly head.  At roughly 500 miles past warranty the electronics on this car got sick.  It started with brake sensors.  First one, then another and then another - all 4 had to be changed out one at a time.  Then the air conditioning failed.  Pensacola, FL dealer diagnosed and said there was a leak in the condenser and needed about $2k in repairs.  I did some diagnosing on my own and it turned out to be a fuse that their service department removed when diagnosing the issue.  Avoid Hill-Kelly Dodge Chrysler Jeep Ram like the plague.  The next thing that went out is the cruise control, which in all my years of driving [50+] I have never experienced nor heard of.  Now the adaptive is out and I am about done with this lemon.  There are so many issues that I can't even remember them all.  Never again a Chrysler in my ownership.

Engine acceleration, ride, comfort.  Problems I've had has been more electrical, which is never good.  Heater went out.  Dealership replaced by order something from the dealership.  Later the Airconditioner went out.  Then the airconditioner control panel went out.  Each time, my car was in the shop for a week.  This all took place within the 3 year 36,000 warranty..  I bought an extended warranty, which was a waste because one of my Bi-xenon headlights went out and it wasn't the bulb. The ballast went bad and you have to replace the whole Headlight Assembly. $1100 to fix my headlight. Needless to say, this car is not RELIABLE.  What good does performance, looks and a nice stereo, if it will cost you thousands after a warranty expires.  This is why I am hesitant to buy American cars, especially Dodge, Chrysler, Jeep, (that includes Fiat, Alfa Romeo.  Look at the Reliability and don't make my mistake.

With that being said it is a luxury car and with a luxury car comes a heafty ptice of service. The big engine to me takes 7 quarts of oil and the awd fluid needs to be changed every 20K miles or so the antifreeze is good until 150K or 2025. Even though oil changes are exoensive they are 10K intervals getting ready for this car.  My last car was a 2013 chevy malibu LT got it with 36K on it and it was beat when i got it i babied it for a solid 3 years right before the engine imploded from a missed oil change i was charged for by a dealer i traded it towards this 300 S awd that i currently have.  The 300S is smooth and feels very nice boind spot monitors navigation and beats audio system is what made me fall in love the thing that sealed the deal was it was AWD 6 cylinder good gas mileage averaging about 21-22 mpg my malibu got 26 mpg average.

chrysler,300,2016,Amanda S, 02/24/2017,A beautiful vehicle at a great value,5,"I test drove Cadillacs and Lexus's before I came upon the 300. I did not think it would be anything special, but the 300 absolutely shocked me, so much as to think, ""why doesn't everyone have one of these?"" The ride is so soft and easy-- absolutely effortless to drive. The UConnect system and entire control system is so easy to use; everything that should have a button or knob does and there's no unnecessary cluttering. I love the way the navigation system appears on the driver's dash and decreases the volume of the music only on the driver's side to give an upcoming direction. I do wish that the navigation system allowed the passenger to type while the vehicle is in motion, but I understand why it doesn't allow it. It is such a comfortable car, and if it isn't, there are a multitude of ways that you can adjust the seat to make it most comfortable. The Pentastar engine is fantastic. It's funny that I had the same engine in my Wrangler, yet in this vehicle it seems entirely different: so refined and reliable. I can't tell the auditory difference between when the vehicle is on and when it is off-- that is a great vehicle. I do wish there was more backseat room, but for someone who rarely has backseat passengers, it's hardly a complaint at all and the massive trunk more than makes up for it. I am so happy with this car-- sporty, classic, bold, luxurious and goes like hell, even without the 8. The panoramic sunroof is gorgeous and hardly makes noise when opened, something a lot of other sunroofs fail to do. I'll be running this vehicle into the ground!

chrysler,300,2016,Jimmy Harrison, 09/12/2016,"Chrysler 300 The good, the bad and the fantastic",4,"The car was a great deal and I got a lot off of the sticker price!  It wasn't the color I wanted (black on black), but the car has been surprisingly pleasant to own and drive.  I have had it now for a month, and enjoy the car.  Positives, technology!  The car is wonderful at keeping you in the lane, warning you of traffic and helping you to stop!  The navigation and U connect systems are stellar.  The acceleration is great and the car is extremely quiet!  What I don't like, rear leg room is not great for such a large car, and the seats are pretty hard.  I love the heated and cooled seats and cup holders.  Finally the front and rear LEDs are great looking and so are the wheels!

Now at over 6k miles the car continues to be great, quiet, technologically capable, powerful, and fun.  The only problem I have had is that the A/C and U-connect screen whet down.  It re-set itself after shutting the car off for a while.   Gas mileage in town about 15 mpg but on the road almost 22mpg.

chrysler,300,2016,BostonBoy, 02/28/2017,300C is a niccce full size car,5,"It has been 1 Year of owning the car and I have updated this review.
I,m a believer you need certain vehicles based on your age. Teenager- hot rod. newly married with no kids-a 4 door sports car like a Nissan Maxima,  having little kids- a minivan or a mid size SUV like a Highlander , purchased a house and will be doing most repairs yourself- Truck, Midlife crisis -Convertible. Well I've been through all that. Next car for me on Lifes  Bucketlist is a ""Old mans car"", there are many out there, from Cadillac , Lincoln, Mercedes etc, I bought myself a 2016 300C, and I love this car!  1st of all, you can get alot off the sticker because they have some tuff competition. Next compare the features in this ultra loaded car to a Cadillac and you can see it,s easily a $10-16000 bargain. Chrysler tries really hard to compete against others by putting a lot in their cars, Michelin mx v4 tires, double  sunroof, nice looking chrome wheels, front and back heated seats(who does that !) a Mercedes looking interior layout, a car frame that was used in previous Mercedes E series, 8 speed transmissions. AWD. huge trunk. Accessories Galore. Driving this car with the V6 I find it to have plenty of power and zip. I drove both the V6 and the V8 Hemi on 2 different days and I honestly could not tell the difference. The ride is very comfortable with the 4 wheel independent  suspension.the car also has a quiet interior.  My only complaint is I find  the middle arm rest is set too far back, your elbow is almost falling off the front of it. Small complaint considering their are a hundred things in a car that could bother you. I have been buying Toyotas, Nissans and Mazda,s  for 30 years now and it feels good to come back to an American car that I can say I really love. As for the Edmunds review of small rear window -who cares, the car comes with radar sensors in bumpers and a  8"" rear back up screen .Take one for a test ride around the town and 1 exit on highway, I think you will be pleasantly  surprised.

I never write reviews....but I had such great luck with this car I had to see if my car was a fluke!  But it looks like these are great cars.  I have a  V8 300S and I beat the h*ll out of it.   Ive driven it 30 miles way back up into the desert.    I put about 24,000 miles a year on it and it has never failed me...... zero maintenance except for oil.  I am even a leadfoot.   Even at 71k I am still on the same set of brakes WTF???   I have owned Vette's and BMW's but this has been the best.  So happy with this car."
chrysler,300,2016,George M., 04/19/2019,My Second One,5,"I am the proud owner of a  fully loaded 2016 Chrysler 300 Limited 90th Anniversary Edition I purchased in October of 2016. This is my second 300 and my wife and my 3rd. My wife had a new 2006 when we met. I also had a 2011 300 Limited same white exterior and black leather interior as the 2016.
All 3 of these cars are and were excellent in every way. We never had any issues and always was the car of choice on any outing or event. The 2011 and 2016 are a big step in the direction of challenging some of the more expensive competitors. We have always compared and found dollar for dollar, the 300 is always the better car and certainly a better buy.
For those of you who have not tried one, I recommend you do so before you make a final decision on your next car purchase. You will be glad you did.
I only hope Chrysler keeps doing the great job they have to this point as well as keeping this car for years to come.
If they do, I will be in the market in a couple of years for my next Chrysler 300 !

The ride is smooth, the sound system is superior to any other car I have ever owned and sometimes when I have arrived at my destination I don't want to get out!  ha ha....  But seriously, this car is fantastic. I have the V6 and it is very powerful on the road.  This baby can move.   My husband is the one who convinced me to get this car.  Granted he has great taste in cars, but I really do love this one and I am glad we chose it.  The panoramic moon roof in the anniversary edition is the best.  I just LOVE that aspect of the car.  I bought my car used and as I was test driving it, I was wondering what would make a person want to give this car up!  It is wonderful.  Get one.  You won't regret it!!

The sport suspension leaves a lot to be desired as well.  I feel that the suspension should be much smoother for a $42,000 sticker price.  The car is beautiful and the electronics and standard safety features are great, however my transmission issues and suspension rattles outweigh the beauty.  The resale value is poor as well.

chrysler,300,2016,Steve, 07/09/2020,A pretty decent car,3,"Very comfortable car. Quality control is lacking as I’ve had a few trim pieces that failed at 50,000 miles. Also had several wiring harnesses not plugged in at the factory. U-connect sucks. It’s slow, pairing takes minutes not seconds. Has decent power for a big car. The transmission can be clunky, it doesn’t like when you go from braking almost to a stop and hit the gas. The doors open wide enough for me to get my mother in law in from a wheelchair, other cars we looked at the doors didn’t open far enough. Engine is actually pretty good if you take care of it. Maintenance is higher than older cars because of the modern engine design almost all new cars are the same idea. I’ve had mine for 3 years now and still like it, just wish the quality control had been better.

My 300 happened to be on the showroom floor and it was love at first sight. Sounds corny, but it is a beautiful car. I have the non metallic Ceramic Gray Clear Coat paint, AWD, The S premium, group and the S Appearance package. Rides like a dream, gas mileage is acceptable for a big car and in sport mode handles really well. Chrysler has made significant improvement in their electronics, infotainment and interior materials. At least they have in the 300. I've owned 5 Jeeps, T&C van and a Sebring Convertible. My 300 is the best of them all. It is a big car, but doesn't have that big car feel inside. Beats audio is wonderful and the styling of the ""S"" trim constantly gets compliments. AWD only available with the V6, which is fine. 300 HP is plenty to move this car. I test drove the Hemi RWD model, but since I live in the snowbelt, AWD was the obvious choice. No regrets. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.

Sleek, comfortable, a lot more performance than you expect for a v6, and great tech included too! CarPlay is by far my favorite feature. Love the use of tech within the car, but still easy to use. Has a volume KNOB (which I love). Great gas mileage, and man do I get compliments on the cars looks (inside and out). Really sharp. I recommend the S model, and the sport appearance package makes the outside look the best. Good job Chrysler.

chrysler,300,2017,Brian S., 06/26/2017,Large American car better than hoped,5,"I bought this car after being in mid sized SUV and large pickup trucks for the past 9 years. Coming from that background, this is an amazing car. I have the Sport model and you cannot be put off by the editor's review here. They reviewed a totally different car than mine in totally different circumstances. I was a little afraid of the comments of the ride and handling but I have not found any of that to be the case. The Sport is a tight, smooth, powerful car in mainstream driving situations. During normal driving it exhibits none of the floatiness or undesirable body roll described here. The seats are bolstered and firm so that one is held tightly in position during turning. They may be a little too small, as many of the Dodge/Chrysler products tend to be. Braking is firm and straight for a large car. In fact, one has to be aware of all the automatic systems in place to help you drive. I brake moderately coming to stops and I can feel the system apply more pressure as one of the safety systems thinks I am not stopping fast enough. Either that or the brakes really grab after a few seconds warm up. The engine is smooth and responsive, especially at passing speeds. And I am getting 28MPG right out of the box at moderate (65-70) highway speeds, which is incredible. Visibility does not seem to be a problem, again coming from a truck background. The quietness is also amazing as is the sound system. My wife bought a new 2016 Charger, the sister car to this and while they share platforms, there are distinct differences that are worth the $10,000 difference. I opted for the AWD system, which may be the only models available here in Minnesota. If all-weather capabilities are what you want or need, this car seems like it will provide them and be a worthy premium choice for large cars available.

The dealer was incredible and so supportive in every way.  The price was greatly appreciated and made my experience at the dealer all that much better.  Now as far as the care it has delivered beyond my expectations.  I was a little aprehensive because I went from the 5.7 L Hemi to the 6 cylinder engine.  I hasn't disapointed one bit and I do appreciate the increased mileage.  The ride is tight and with the 300 S version the car is glued to the road.   I love the performance tires and the overall look that is the 300 S version.  The interior is every bit as incredible if not better than my old 300 C.  This vehicle blows me away!

chrysler,300,2017,JTM, 05/16/2017,Updated review - warranty and customer service,3,"I bought this my 300 last week and love it!  Comfortable ride and so far am getting 23.5 mph average town and road.  How great is that?  :-)  Rides like a dream and is easy to drive.  Looks great to boot!  I HIGHLY recommend this car!  I bought the Velvet Cherry with the linen colored leather seats.  Am sooo happy!

Update:  I've had this car for 1 year and have had to take it in for repairs 3 times.  The warrenty that I paid $1,200 for is no good.  My back wheels started rattling horribly.  Took it into the dealership in Opelika, AL for repair which should have been covered with only 10,000 miles and 11 months ownership.  They said...  not original wheels and they would not honor Chrysler dealership in FL where car was purchased during a move after hitting a deer that totaled my last car (A Chevy which brand I should have gone back to) and I tried to get car wheels fixed under my ""purchased"" warrenty.  They would not honor that either and I would have to pay $1,200 per wheel to get fixed.  A friend told me to take the car to a tire place in Valley, AL which I did and they took off the wheels and put a small piece of cardboard behind the hubcaps and no more rattle.  And, they did not charge me a thing.  
I called Chrysler customer service and they would not honor the warrenties either.  I will never buy another Chrysler and would trade the car but my mother loves driving it.  I'm currently driving her 2012 Chevy Acadia and she's driving my 300 (She drives alot less that I do).  
Long story short - I will never buy another Chrysler and do not recommend to my friends and family.  It's a pretty car but without my car being wrecked or any damage, the wheels just started rattling and I could get no service from Chrysler or the dealerships.  No wonder the company about went under years ago.  :-)

Update 5/2019. Sold the car.  Just did not feel comfortable driving something that Chrysler and their dealerships will not stand behind.  I’m now driving my 83 yr old mother’s 2012 GMC Acadia.  It is solid and the Chevy/gmc dealership here in my home town in Al does whatever we need done to it at a reasonable price and this car has never had an issue.  Will never buy a Chrysler product again and I do not recommend.

chrysler,300,2017,meathead 1986, 07/07/2019,Toe 2 Toe with 2016 Azera,5,"After already owning a 2016 Base Azera we traded in 2 other vehicles for this 1. We now have both being driven daily in our household and I can say they both offer a unique ride. 300 is built VERY well and gets decent mileage for its size. biggest thing this car has over the Azera is the AWD which makes it a beast. Outside of that and it's super American styling the Azera can keep up with it on dry pavement while offering a slew of features you can't get on the S model unless you pay much more money. This is a great choice however just make sure you really do your homework and really look at what features you want. 

Numbers on paper are nearly identical in the performance category with only a 1mpg improvement and a 1ft smaller turning radius on the Azera. Don't know why they went to an 8-speed transmission as it seems like a lot and the Hyundai can get away with 6 and keep up.... 

In the end it does it's job very well and makes you feel ""snobby"" when driving it which is what it's intended to do in my opinion.

Again look around as this isn't the only option but a very good one.

***UPDATE*** 2020 JAN 8

After having the car for some time now I can say it's been a great replacement to the Azera with a few quirks thrown in.

-Ride Quality
           *Ride quality is pretty impressive in this car. Somehow with it's crazy weight it manages to balance the stiffness spirited drivers like with the ability to absorb most bumps presented in the road. This coupled with the AWD system on the car provides a great balance for such a large car and I can see now why so many people like it.

-Acceleration
          *When in normal drive mode this can seem mediocre. However, when you turn off traction control and put it into sport mode (using paddle shifters) this thing is impressive!!! for a V6 it has plenty of power in the midrange.

- Room
          * You really shouldn't have to read this to know that this is a big luxury car with space to spare. The only complaint I'd say I have on this subject is that the back seats don't have nearly as much legroom as expected for a car of this size. Once you get to the trunk though you see that large void to fill and that makes up for it. Another minor issue is that it's so large that when you have just a few smaller items they tend to roll around and get everywhere back there. Not a huge issue but can be slightly annoying.

- Tech
          * After owning this thing for some time now and playing with all the features and options it isn't bad. I know they took care of alot of complaints in newer models so I really won't even gripe about much outside the fact that the base model S doesn't offer any blind spot warning. with a car this big and mirrors that small you really need them here and I hope that they snuck this into the newer models. Something else that hopefully is fixed is that in the frigid temps up here when it snows or there's freezing drizzle/rain the defroster can't keep up with it without you being smoked out of the car. Because of this the wipers don't do their job and freeze up, causing you to have to stop and break ice from them after every 20-25min of driving in these conditions. 

- Gas Mileage
          * OK so this is a large car... and with my wife's habits of hibitually remote starting this thing it KILLS the gas mileage. if it weren't for that this thing would average somewhere around 27-28mpg's between city and highway. but because she loves a warm vehicle in the cold we average 11... 11 mpg's... haha. for such a large car 27mpg's average isn't that bad (I'm not including my wifes bad habits) and easily stays on par with the old Azera mentioned in the initial review while having AWD and looking sharper on the outside.

- Maintenance and other minor issues
          * Outside of the normal oil changes and tire rotations this thing has been a real pleasure to drive 95% of the
 time. a few quirks you should be aware of when driving this thing. When you have your phone paired and are listening to whatever is coming through your phone, EVERY time you get a text message the car begins to break down who sent it... every time. If you have kids that don't know how to include everything in one message this can lead to a string of 10-20 notifications and become VERY annoying. Next is when the key fob begins to die and say dropping kids off at school, the car will notify you that the fob has left the vehicle (it's still in your pocket or purse or whatever) and you must then place the car in park, turn it off, turn it on and be on your way. Seems minor until you go to start the car and it won't start (dieing fob) and could become an emergency. my reccomendation is always keep a fresh set of batteries in the center console/glove box so you can change them on the fly. Keep in mind you'll need a knife or scissors  to open the battery packages on these things.

Overall this is a very nice vehicle with alot to offer at a very reasonable price. you wont be dissapointed.

Nothing wrong with the standard 6 cylinder for most people, but the V8 makes better sense with this 4400 pound car.  The only issues I have with the car is that the ride quality could be better.  I constantly hear thumping sounds coming from the suspension over irregular pavement to the point I had the car inspected to see if something was loose in the suspension.  Nothing was found, just the way the car is.  If I had to do over, I would get the 300C as the suspension is not as tight at the S model.  If I could change anything about the car it would be the rotating gear selector.  IT SUCKS!!  Wish they would go back to a real shifter lever.  I have to be looking at the knob when I go from drive to park as I find that it will stop at reverse and will lurch backwards.  I know the rotating knob shifters are the latest thing, but they are not as intuative as a regular shifter.

I've owned the 300C for two months. A V8 engine for great power when needed on the highway, easy to use controls, safety features galore, plenty of room for passengers and a large trunk. Fold down rear seats a real plus. 19 speaker stereo system is terrific.  Runs on regular gas and surprising good highway gas mileage. I got 29mpg on my first long trip. I personally love the design because it is different then any other sedan on the road. It remains to be seen how it will hold up over time.....but for now it  is a pleasure to drive.

chrysler,300,2018,Garrick, 10/23/2018,300 Fleet review!,4,"First off, let me disclose that we are a 10 year limo company in Florida with a fleet of Caddis, lincolns and 300s. We have put over 250k miles on most (have 6) of these 300s with very little issues. These cars are built solid, quiet and efficient. The mileage and performance in these cars is far and above any of our other makes. We have a number of our high end business clients that request the 300 over the others simply because of the comfort (back seat position), room and quietness to make calls and do work. As a driver I can honestly say that everything is exactly where it needs to be...easy to read, control and fine tune...The climate control is perfect (even with black ext. and black int. in Florida!!),  the ride and handling is quiet, tight and responsive. The MPG vs the power in our V6 cars is excellent as well.

chrysler,300,2018,Jeff Webb, 06/18/2018,"Great Car, 2nd 300!",4,"I have never had any significant problems with either of my 300's.    Put lots of miles on them (168,000 first one) (138,000 second - so far).  It really helps to have a good dealer.  I have a really good one in the small town where I live.  I see many comments about bad repair issues.  The consistency of Chrysler dealers is an issue.

chrysler,300,2018,Dale DB, 01/11/2019,Review by a pro,5,"I drive for Uber and Lyft. Over 125 miles a day. Very comfortable car easy access and very easy for people to get in and out of. Very quiet on the road and that is important for conversations as most people are in the back seats. 20 to 23 mpg. No maintenance issues and I receive compliments all the time on the looks of the car. Info system and screen is terrific, located and easily accessible. Large trunk can hold 4 suitcases for airport runs. Excellent visibility all around the vehicle. Had a very smooth ride and handles road bumps very well.

chrysler,300,2018,Russell Montgomery, 11/16/2018,Great deal,5,"Much better than I expected. Leased the car a year ago , 8,000 miles, and had no idea how much I’d like it. I chose the 300S because of the deal and not the car. Quality has been excellent as has performance. All systems and menus are intuitive or easy to figure out. We have another new car and after a month I’m still going to YouTube to figure out the menus. I have blind spot monitoring so I don’t have visibility problems. I’ve been surprised at how much I’ve enjoyed the alpine speakers. Gas mileage is not an issue with me as I don’t drive many miles. Last winter the awd handled snowy roads easily. The tires have wide sidewalls and seem more resistant to road damage than those on other cars we’ve owned. The one issue I have is that it is a very large sedan and I do search for parking spots that are easy to access. The extra walk is good for me and cheaper than the gym I work out at. Although I’m in an age group that generally prefers large sedans I normally like smaller cars, my toy is a 1991 Mazda Miata. I have absolutely no regrets about my lease and am thoroughly enjoying driving this great example of the dying breed of sedans."

I had owned several German luxury  brands to compare.  For the price point, this vehicle serves as a large smooth high tech luxo cruser with great styling and feel.  The 20 inch wheels provide great handling and you can really feel the road.  This is my second S model that is actually better than the first one. Great on the road with plenty of style, room, and comfort.

chrysler,300,2018,Erik, 05/29/2018,Worthy Tribute to 60's 300,5,"The classic American luxo-cruiser sedan survives, the 300 Hemi pays tribute to it forerunners of the 60's with great respect for tradition.  I have owned several 300's and Chargers, they are just great cars.  Driving comfort, great style and power o'plenty are this car's greatest attributes.  The C&D and Edmunds reviewers always complain about body roll and other handling characteristics that the vast majority of drivers, including enthusiasts couldn't distinguish from dog doodle--people that buy this car do so for it's all too uncommon style and comfort--not to put it on the track at Road America.  The 300 is a great ride for your daily driver, even with the Hemi it gives respectable fuel economy.  A skilled driver can squeeze 20-21 mpg for a typical mix of city and highway driving.  I hope the next generation is even better.

chrysler,300,2018,Douglas Sander, 01/30/2019,Love our flawless 300AWD,5,"When compared to comparable cars, the price alone makes it a must see.  After driving it, the ride, performance, luxury, and power to weight are excellent.  Ours has leather interior w/ panoramic moon roof, feels almost like an air conditioned convertible.  I've run fleets for over 45 years, owned over 20 POV's , and I have had few that could match the combination of fun, looks, performance, luxury that we found our 300 AWD.  Then, add the plus of the AWD and Winter just became a whole lot easier.  We've had it 2 years and it has been absolutely flawless.  Could not be happier.  And, Findlay Chrysler/Jeep in Post Falls,  is, without a doubt, the best car dealership we've ever done business with, and I've been through a few in 55 years of driving.

chrysler,300,2018,Terri McCard, 03/29/2018,Will never buy another Chrysler!,1,"I have owned my BRAND NEW 300 for 8 months.  I had to take it back to the dealership the first time because the passenger side door panel was bucking up and coming off.  THAT was fixed under the warranty (oh, and let me mention that I paid $800 extra for the warranty that was supposed to cover the car as long as I own the car).  I moved from FL back home to AL 3 months ago.  Last month (with 10,000 miles on the car please keep in mind), the back driver wide wheel starting rattling like a bucket of bolts.  I took it to the dealership here in AL confident that would be fixed too.  Well, guess what?  The warranties are VOID because the dealership in FL swapped the wheels and the original equipment wheels are not on the car anymore.  This swap was never mentioned to me and now that $800 warranty I paid for is not worth the paper it's written on.  I am probably going to trade this car that rides and looks good and take a loss on it because the little things are aggravating me to death and it's not worth the aggravation.  I am going back to Chevy products.  I never in 40 years of driving had this problem with Chevy vehicles and they always stood behind their products.  I even called Chrysler yesterday and today and was told this was a ""dealership"" problem.  Well, it's not going to be my problem for much longer.  I am sick and tired of getting nowhere and listening to ""excuses"".  Chrysler customer service and reliability is nothing to speak of.  I paid a lot of money for this car and the warranty.   Shame on this company!  No wonder there are so many Fords and Chevys on the road.

UPDATE:  Edmunds asked for a updated review since it's been awhile since I posted the original.  My 83 year old mother drives the Chrysler and I drive her 12 year old Chevy to work.  She only drives to the store and church and it is easier for her to get into than her Chevy.  I still will never buy another Chrysler product as long as I live and as soon as I get this one paid down some or if something happens to my mother (I pray not), it will be traded for a Chevy.  Still not a happy camper because the warrenty sucks and I'm just praying nothing happens to it that is major.

chrysler,300,2018,The Real KP, 08/04/2019,I love this car!!!,5,"I bought this car used a little over a year ago. Except for a few quirks in the infotainment it has performed perfectly. The AWD performed flawlessly this past winter. The heated steering wheel is a must have if you live in the northern climates. The 3.6 Pentastar engine does a great job of moving this heavy car. The 8 speed ZF transmission also does a good job but can be caught by surprise occasionally. I’ve adapted to it though. The gas mileage could be better but I don’t take long trips so I don’t know how good the highway mileage is. The 6 speaker premium sound system is one of the best I’ve ever heard. Seats are comfortable and on the rare occasion I’m not listening to music, it’s quiet as a tomb going down the road. The Michelins I’m sure contribute.
I’ve had cars that I just loved to get into but not at this level! The climate control is also one of the best that I’ve seen as far as heating and cooling quickly which is amazing for such a big car!
The only sad part is that they’ll probably be discontinued.
What a beautiful looking car!

chrysler,300,2018,Herb, 11/14/2019,Is a 300 For You?,4,"I purchased 2018 Chrysler 300 AWD Touring off the dealer's floor as a left-over in 2019. First the good things--it is a beautiful triple black with heated leather seats, V6, special wheels, double moon roof,  large screen navigation system, sirus-XM. The 300 rides well, and feels solid. There is an annoying ""clicking-like"" rattle behind the driver. It took me weeks to find the source which was a a large interior plastic piece. I fixed it, but on occasion it makes a noise when going over bumps. The dashboard is exquisite with a nighttime blue hue to the instruments. The automatic transmission selector in a knob, which has taken me quite a while to get use to. Although I don't have the top sound system, it is still really good. The rear camera is a blessing, and should have been on vehicles much earlier. I think that in this case, unlike the Charger or Challenger, the 300 is an acquired taste. Although to some it may look stodgy, it is really an elegant design. I gave the 300 4-stars, because some of the ""niggling"" issues impacted on the true enjoyment of ownership. But, for what I consider a real bargain, I recommend this 300 touring, which lands  barely south of $40K.

This 2018 model is a great ride with comfortable seats and modern safety equipment. The one drawback is the entertainment system. If you need to adjust the controls, make a call or do anything that requires the controls to be seen, the radio has to be turned on. My previous 300's never had to be on and the system would always show most of the controls while the Radio was off but this new one has to be turned on to use any other function the entertainment system gives you. When the car is in reverse and the camera goes on, you can't turn on the radio. The car has to be in park or driving forward for the radio to be turned on. I have called the dealer and Chrysler and was told this is how the new model functions. Until they fix this screwup, this will be the last Chrysler I own.

V6 is smooth, quiet and efficient.  The seating is very comfortable and the U-Connect 8.4 setup is very good (std. 6 speakers).  With Google Maps, Waze, Scanner Radio and lots of Apps, there is absolutely NO NEED FOR GPS built in as an option   Our past experience with Mercedes (2012 E-Class Cabriolet and 2017 GLC 300 4 Matic) were okay but this is more comfortable, quieter because of thicker door glass and insulation, much less expensive to maintain AND all the bugs have been ironed out via past models.   Price discounts from dealer was extraordinary.   Plus, we got three years of full synthetic oil changes, tire rotation and balancing, and the usual 'inspection' and fluid topping off thrown it.   My 300 is Glossy Black and the color is very 'deep'; my wife's 300 is White and it shines too.  My car has 8600 miles since Dec. 2019; my wife's has 9800 miles since Dec. 2019.  At 70-75 mph, my MPG is about 32-33 and about 25-26 in stop and go but we are not in a big city environment.

chrysler,300,2019,Reilly Hamer, 04/25/2020,It's the exterior styling that grabbed me.,4,"I'm a former Ford Taurus owner (2010 and 2017 model year). While I was happy with the Taurus overall, I couldn't help but stare every time a Chrysler 300 passed me on the road. The Taurus was roomy and comfortable, nice ride, but the exterior?
Well, it's...'okay'. But the Chrysler 300 exterior has ATTITUDE. It's just more masculine looking than the Taurus.
I bought a 2019 300 (not the hemi, but the V6 for better gas mileage), and, so far,
am very happy. Plenty of power with the V6, and 27mpg on the road. This car has a great feel to it, and just looks expensive.
Why not five stars? Well, I haven't owned the car that long. Also, I paid for the upgraded stereo (Harmon Kardon), but it's just not quite as good as the 'Sony Clear Phase Audio' I had on the Taurus. Also, the 
'Full Speed Forward Collision Warning with Active Braking' doesn't work all the time- only with cruise control engaged. So in every day, around town traffic, you need to pay full attention of cars in front of you;
this system won't do it for you. Otherwise,
I'm proud to drive this beautiful, roomy sedan.

With adapters, they could even play their game consoles. The car has been very reliable and has never given me a problem. I always had the scheduled maintenance performed and as various things needed repair, I did that. Everything was great and I loved this car. About a year ago when the car had just over 100,000 miles, my mechanic told me there was a little rust forming on the undercarriage. I was shocked! The car has been garaged since the day I purchased it. I had the car washed regularly to remove dirt, snow, and salt from the under carriage. During the past year everything has gone wrong. The air conditioning went out, probably the condenser, they said. The DVD player started making a screeching noise whenever I started the motor. That needed to be disconnected. The fan won't stop blowing at high speed, even when turned off, and the final blow...the rust on the undercarriage has become so bad, my mechanic said it's unsafe to drive! Even though it's thirteen years old, it only has 112,000 miles. The engine is fine. The undercarriage is toast! I'm retired, now I can't drive my car.

chrysler,pacifica,2004,Its a lemon, 02/02/2008,Wish I had listened to Consumer Reports!,2,"I thought I was getting a bargain but it got me.  Since we bought it in Jan 05 I have replaced an axle, axle seals, oil pan, rear differential and now the transmission.  When it runs its nice but now I wish I could get rid of it.  Unfortunately the Pacifica loses value so quickly you are likely to be thousands in the hole the second you drive off the lot.  Its very tempting to look at these used Pacifica as a bargain, but remember you are really gambling with this car.  You may be the guy who gets lucky or you be the guy like me who has spent $6000+ in repairs in the last two years"
chrysler,pacifica,2004,dkrogh, 10/08/2012,Nice ride~,4,"I bought my Pacifica 2004 brand new. It's a beautiful vehicle and the ride is unbelievably comfortable. If you are driving this vehicle and you don't feel its comfortable then maybe you have cheap tires because my vehicle glides along the freeway smoothly. I absolutely love this vehicle. Sure its has some quirks, front end makes a noise when braking and I've read reviews on this and many have the same issue but doesn''t effect proformance at all. Gas mileage sucks but I knew this when I bought it as I
read reviews first. It seats
6 but the rear is mainly for children and their is no cargo space with full load so you would need luggage rack. I've had it 8 yrs. 106,000 miles"
chrysler,pacifica,2004,vmanzanares951, 11/13/2014,and the problem goes on,2,"So I bought my pacifica in May 2014 at a dealership in Temecula, CA saw the carfax car seemed great except it was from Missouri. Well thats should have told me something there but I didn't know. Now I have replaced the front struts 4 times since May replaced the axles twice emissions problems then motor mounts went out ALL 4, This is the disaster part, My Sub-Frame is completely Rusted the rear end can not be aligned until I replace the alignment parts because they are so rusted. Got a flat tire and went to crank my car up with the stock jack and it went right thru the driver side floorboard. I don;t know what to do anymore I paid way over the price for everything sale 6k repairs 4k "
chrysler,pacifica,2004,Chinatown, 08/19/2010,It is a shame they stopped making it,4,"Bought the car with 25,000. It now has 66,000. Still have the original brakes. My local mechanic says I should be good for about another 10,0000.  Yes, I have had the same repeated problems with the suspension. However, I bought an extended warranty ( 6 years/100,000 miles), through my credit union with no deductible. The only thing I have paid for, outside of routine maintenance is the Wisconsin tax on the bill. I replaced the tires at 45,000."
chrysler,pacifica,2004,JLaVigne, 11/07/2010,Glad I bought it,4,"Bought when 1 year old with 15k miles.  Car had some initial warranty work done on it (tie rod end, rear transaxle leak, etc.) Bought extended warranty because of the repairs, but has been solid ever since.    Under-powered for sure but a great hwy cruiser.  Large, comfortable, well appointed cabin for me (I'm 6'4"" 260 so a bit of extra interior room is appreciated.)  Wife and kids have plenty of room and plenty of creature comforts.  MPG is so-so at 17-18 around town but 23-24 on highway.  It is my daily driver and I have been very pleased with it over the last 5.5 years.   Given the state of affairs at Chrysler I am not sure I would buy another Chrysler, but this C-Pac has been great."
chrysler,pacifica,2004,assila, 12/30/2013,Love hate relationship,3,"I bought my Pacifica used in January 2012. I had not had any real problems with my Pacifica until January 2013. I ended up having a preemie who was hospitalized an hour away from where I lived. After a late night visit to the hospital my steering wheel
locked up on the interstate going 75mph on my way back home. I was able to get the car off to the side of the interstate right before it completely died on me. Got the car towed home, then towed to a mechanic who said it was multiple problems. We put in a new fuse box But still come not get the car running. ($1,500 spent) It seemed to be running then as soon as we drove it home it would die again. Found it to be a lose wire in the door!"
chrysler,pacifica,2004,lalacovey, 09/12/2011,dont buy it,2,"i saw it drove it fell in love, bought it used, barely drove it and stuff started breaking, left my family stranded, front axle broke n wheels did a spllit... cost over 500 just for part used from junkyard, bushings gone, suspensions gone, heat n ac broke, bottoms out everywhere... replacement 17"" tires 125 each, 14.8 miles/gallon, broken eexhaust at flex pipe burns oil....
had 2 years bad break downs... gas gauge suddenly went from 1/2 tank to empty, light came on, couldnt get all the way off the interstate so had too abndon car n walk my 2 year old 11 and 15 yr olds... picked up along way, called n got gas n left, no warning at all.....
not worth hassles.... parts even used too much..."
chrysler,pacifica,2004,jp384, 08/24/2011,"Good idea, bad implementation.",2,"Not the most comfortable car to drive. Feels like a boat and I'm afraid of hitting everything when I'm in the city. Front suspension seems a bit loose so every time we had to stop quick, the front would take a deep dive and when it went over a driveway that was higher then the road it would bottom out at 12 mph, which might be why the bearing plates broke (something our mechanic told us was common in them). Learning transmission never up shifted when it should have and loved to rev up to the red before it would finally shift. Needs plus gas for power and fuel economy. For a car thats supposed to be a town car and SUV I think Chrysler failed to make a car thats good at being either."
chrysler,pacifica,2004,Emily, 04/01/2010,My Chrystler Pacifica,2,"I purchased my first Pacifica in the summer of 2004 and in two weeks time it had broken down, almost got me hit on the 4-lane, and was towed back to the dealership.  I then got a slightly used Pacifica-same type, different color, and after about a year it started having engine lights come on for no reason, it had transmission lights flash constantly, then the skipping started after about 2 years.  It has skipped and jumped, especially when the cruise is on ever since about 2007.  Then just this last week, I was driving to work and the car just quit going down the road. The steering went out, it wouldn't do a thing. By the way,I have serviced it every 3,000 mi."
chrysler,pacifica,2004,ign17, 05/07/2017,Tried and extremely true.,5,"I'm a new driver; I've had my license for less than a year. However, I've been a passenger in a 2004 Pacifica for nearly 11 years. The car is incredibly reliable and I grew to love it so much that I asked my dad to give it to me as a first car, as opposed to selling it. (The value depreciated to a near-ridiculous extent.) It was purchased in 2006 with less than 50,000 miles on it. The space within the car is phenomenal with the back row of seats down. Whether you're hauling people or large objects (like other high school students or your practice gear), it fits comfortably. Leather interiors are a plus. Blind spots are a bit of an issue, but it's just a matter of being careful. Cabin noise isn't too bad. The car has only had one major maintenance problem: A computer bug with the air conditioning and windshield wipers (at the same time, I might add), though this was with 250,000 miles and 11 years of age on the car. It's made several road trips from Virginia to Alabama and back, and it's held up beautifully (mechanically and aesthetically). The acceleration can occasionally feel sluggish, but the brakes remain smooth and I feel very in-control behind the wheel. It's wide, though! This makes it somewhat difficult to park when I'm strapped for space. Overall, it's a solid 9.5 out of 10. I love the Pacifica dearly!

I have never had so many things go wrong on a car.  When I bought my Pacifica, I thought it would be the perfect  blend between ability to carry my family and clients, tow a boat and not have the fuel consumption of my 5.7 liter tundra. Boy was I wrong.  The fuel mileage is actually worse (15.4 mix city/hwy), I have so far needed to replace both motor mounts (by the way when I bought it it had 36k miles. Now 42k), the driver's seat (because it moves just enough to annoy the hell out of you when you leave a light), there is the well documented creak in the front end, periodically there is a clunk when "

chrysler,pacifica,2004,Joe Smith, 01/15/2009,Big Mistake,3,"I bought this car against my better judgment. I did some research, and found most of the reviews to be negative. I've had to replace the blower module, both headlamps. The heater controls never seem to work right. It burns a quart of oil in between oil changes,and the front end makes all kinds of noises when turning. By far the worst car I've ever owned."

We bought it used with a hair over 40000 miles and only have a couple thousand more on it, but has not had one problem thus far like a lot of reviewers have mentioned. (Knock on wood, as that is why we purchased this vehicle as our old Lumina was nickle and diming us to death!) I believe we got a good one as it is mint! No scratches, dents....nothing! Even put on new OEM Michelins, which was a nice touch from the dealership. Only got the power- train warranty to 100,000 miles, so hoping we don't run into the tire-rod ends or control arm problem. Drives perfect for my wife and kids! "

chrysler,pacifica,2004,Derrick, 04/24/2010,"Plenty of Room, Too many issues",3,"This vehicle caught our eye immediately on the lot.  We purchased it for the sole purpose of interior space and safety rating.  With a very high safety rating and 3 rows of seats, this met our criteria.   After about 2 years of enjoying the car in the summer time, we also came to the conclusion that we never should have purchased a non-AWD vehicle in Colorado Springs.  This vehicle handles terribly on the snow.  We had to buy winter tires just to get around.  After 3 years, the problems started. Control Arm, in-dash computer, fuel gauge, struts, mounts, sway bar, etc."

Had a few problems, same as some noise and squeaking and clunk front end. Original brakes had them checked several times. So far so good, right now having issue with stalling, surging, ran codes and found nothing so far so keep""n fingers crossed. But all in all I love it. Going on a long trip this vehicle is like riding on a cloud, such comfort. I knew when I bought it about the gas so I can't complain on that. Its held up nicely so far. Also have a sebring. 2001"
chrysler,pacifica,2004,Edwinna Brubaker, 10/15/2010,Our trip,5,Hi. Just wanted to let you know that your pacifica rated excellent with us. This past summer my husband and myself took a trip from New Hampshire to Colorado and back.  I'm handicapped due to problems with my liver and other health problems so we weren't sure if I could make the trip or not. My husband put both rows of the seats down and made a bed for me when I got tired or was in pain. The pacifica performed well. We had no problems at all with the car and were able to make side trips to see the presidents and I was able to rest anytime I needed to.  Thank you again for making a car flexible for us to use.

chrysler,pacifica,2004,Craig, 12/30/2005,Wondering about reliability,3,"We got the full featured model with DVD changer, etc.  It's an excellent balance between SUV solidity and the handling of a car.  We've had some mechanical problems though.  The brake rotors were warped, and when the rear windows are open an obnoxious ear-deafening vibrating sound can be heard.  Visibility is really bad with the small rear view window.  Our driver side mirror makes clicking noise and has limited mobility; this was reported to dealer mechanic, but they didn't do anything.  The tire sensors continuously go off--it's very hard to keep the air balanced accordingly. Avoid dealer mechanics at all costs-- boy do they rip you off! I only get 19 MPG--which is much lower than sticker"
chrysler,pacifica,2004,benneyb, 01/20/2006,2004 Pacifica 4WD,3,"Overall, a very good vehicle that does not live up to the ""designed/influenced etc. by Mercedes"" line the dealer trys to push. Excellent for 4 people, but flipping the middle seats down to get 2 additional in the back is a problem.  Decent performance held back by 4 spd transmission and peaky motor.  Very good handling until limited suspension travel used up, with a thud.  Very little stowage space with all seats up, decent with rear seats folded.  Outstanding in snow and poor conditions (4WD model). Overall, a feeling of lack of refinement.  Others likely not as demanding nor push as hard as me - YMMV."

We needed a car to fit all 5 us so we needed a 3rd seat. I researched all midsize SUV's with 3rd row seating. No 3rd row seat was functional or comfortable and all are hard to get to. We looked at larger SUV's (Yukon, Expedition, Tahoe). A bit to large for my wife & 200-250 a month on gas alone - uh no. A small vanity issue kept us out of minivans hence the Pacifica. Great so far. NICE style bells & whistles, all wheel drive is great (we did purchase the most comprehensive ext. warranty to cover these bells and whistles up to 100,000 miles). Great use of interior space.

I had the car fully check before I made a final commitment.  And after purchasing the Pacifica, I really love it.  It's fun to drive, and doesn't feel like a mini van.   There is lots of run for the kids, I'm tall and both my sons are tall.  It's good on gas, and look really nice.  I'm totally happy. "

The style is great and by the looks of all the new 2007's every one in the industry thinks so too. The only real problem I had was the mileage. The first 42,000 miles the best mileage I could attain is 16 mpg. Then for some reason  I started to get around 20. The car is built on the e class platform from Mercedes and the only real improvement I would request is a Mercedes diesel engine. I had the oil change regularly and had no service problems with my car. The mileage and the ratings of safe cars will determine if I buy another."
chrysler,pacifica,2004,Michelle, 04/22/2008,"Ahh, the scent of lemons!",3,"I loved the car when I bought. It is definitely a safe car to drive, but it wreaks havoc in your wallet. Does anyone want unexplainable stalling? How about heat when the blower motor and resistor go out? Or the best of all experience shaking in the front of their car because you have to replace the outer tie rod and nut set? Don't forget about 10,000 miles later you have to replace the inner ones; one more thing don't forget to add a new set of tires about every two years. Suggestion invest in an extended warranty or get a second job."

We solved it with little oval mirrors stuck on sideview mirrors. We have actually done this to every car we've owned. My wifes pacifica has the electronic rear view mirror. If I get my own pacifica I will change that to a conventional day/night mirror.It is hard to see at night when backing up,esp with tinted windows.I would probably install back up camera. I don't think they are that costly anymore.I would love to have an Escalade or a Navigator but they are lousy on gas.

Though I don't own a Mercedes, I would not compare the quality of this auto with a Mercedes - far from it.  Generally it has a low quality feel.  Very low power (even when new) from a 6 cylinder reported to be 250 hp plus really poor mileage (15 mpg). Then add stupid problems that are quality related such as an oil pan made of ""soft aluminum"" whose drain plug is easily stripped ($700 repair), air conditioner failure, lots of batteries (four so far), heater fan failure, rocker panel made of breakable plastic. In comparison, my Acura tl with equal miles (90k) drives like the day I purchased it and has required no repairs"

Borge Warner should have done a far better job.  The Pacifica is in my words is not an dependable vehicle.  Intake manifold is open at both ends, this allows mice to live between the V of the engine block, causing a chewing off the anti-knock sensor wire.

This vehicle has been very reliable and a pleasure to drive for the past two years.  This vehicle could have been rated an excellent vehicle by me, if Chrysler would have improved the following areas: Increase engine power; add vision system to increase rear-view sight during parking; improve awful vanity mirror lighting; add durable cover to top of rear bumper to protect it from cargo damage; Add identical upgraded 19-inch rim option for spare tire; add video screen to dash for front passenger; improved difficult 2nd row seating access to 3rd row seating."

different that everyone else's SUV, the
cost is way less than a ML 350 or X5.

Ours is loaded-I mean loaded-leather, nav, 6 disc changer, power seats, Windows, mirrors, sunroof, heated seats, dvd, dual and rear climate controls, 17 in. Chrome wheels, power up and down liftgate, keyless entry, memory seats, power pedals. So you should get the picture. It drives like a car, it's a blast to be in, period! I may just have a lead foot but can relate to the poor gas mileage and poor visibility out the rear. I love this car and I'm sure most people will given the chance to drive it."
chrysler,pacifica,2004,Stacey Severson, 04/26/2008,Goodbye Minivan!!,4,"I absolutely love it.  I have only had it a week now but am so happy it works with our 2 kids and I no longer own a minivan which I hated.  I never expected all the extras including the GPS, DVD, etc, but I only have one complaint, it makes me nervous when checking the blind spot on the drivers side.  I hope that is no longer an issue on the newer models. "
chrysler,pacifica,2004,barHbar, 06/07/2008,A Pleasure to Drive,4,"I usually keep a car no more than 18 months. I have kept this care for 5 years and have 120k miles. Transmission rebuilt at 110k is all. I have only two negative things to say. 1) there is a bad blind spot on right rear window exceedingly dangerous. You really need to watch it. 2) Chryslers just don't seem to keep their value and because of that, no more Chryslers.  The Car is great and I would buy another if they were to keep making them and I could get the price down to pay for the depreciation problem."
chrysler,pacifica,2004,rockinsheppymom, 06/22/2008,Wonderful car,4,"This has been one of the best cars I have owned. For an SUV, it rides like a dream on the Mercedes chassis. It has been extremely reliable. The only minor problem I had was the setback button for the top part of the seat would not work, but the mechanic fiddled with it and got it working. I still have the original brakes at 57k! My hubby had an LHS when they first came out; it was also one of his favorite cars, and he has since owned a Cadillac and two BMWs. I also owned a Chrysler van which had no problems either. If they made this in a hybrid, I would buy it again. "

It feels extremely solid , very smooth at highway speeds and brakes that are powerful.  Never thought I would use the Auto/manual trans but a trip through the mountains of W Va. made me very happy we had it. Seating for 1st 2 rows is excellent, 3rd row is the penalty box. Accessories are over and above what we need.  At 47,000 miles we have had 1 ""fit and finish"" issue with one of the roof rails (dealer fixed on the 3rd try) and the fuel gauge stopped working (1st try fix). We were rear ended by a VW Jetta. Jetta was totaled. Pacifica, just under $3,000 for the rear bumper, exhaust etc.  This car is very safe. Would buy another"

It only takes the push of one button after my husband, who is a foot taller than me, has driven it. With my short legs the adjustable pedals put an end to my sitting on the steering wheel. The front, rear, side and roof air bags I hope I will never have to use but a great comfort to have, just in case. It's great at the drive in!"

Since then I have had to replace the inner and outer tie- rod ends, struts, axels, lower control arm, sway arm bushings on both front driver and passenger side. There still is a creaking noise in the front when you hit a bump. Mechanic has no clue what it is. Then I had a problem with the engine revving up when at stop sign the shutting off. Had to replace the erg valve control sensor. "

It rides *SO* smoothly (& we've had to take MANY road trips for work) and with my 8 month old son, I feel VERY safe. Only been to the mechanic once for a U joint--other than that, no problems at all. I have a base model, no GPS or DVD, & the 3rd row was a bit snug when me and my SIL sat back there once (and I'm 5'8"" and she is 5'10"") but my husband is 6'1"" and is a SOLID 245 and has ROOM to stretch in the front two rows, and has great head room. With the side air bags, I don't worry about my baby as much on the road! If I won the lottery, I'd buy this car again."
chrysler,pacifica,2004,Ernie, 09/13/2008,Never again,1,I bought my pacifica thinking I was getting the newest trend. The only thing I got was the shaft as in the drive shaft.

Well finally found it and this crossover has been horrible for us. First thing wrong 4 days after buying it car shuts down on expressway no reason, next oil leaking, next starts making clapping noise, next starts kicking back while driving as if changing gears! Next had to have pulley tensioner replaced now making horrible noise that wont go away, now alternator is failing! What else can go wrong, this was supposed to be my dream car n turns out to be a nightmare! "
chrysler,pacifica,2004,Kraz_Eric, 01/25/2009,Found a new favorite!,4,"I have finally found a new favorite car. I bought it used, with less than 100,000 miles and only one owner. It looks and feels nearly new. It handles well, with the basic outward size and feel as a large sedan, but the internal size is spacious and comfortable. Plenty of room for family and cargo. I truly love the style and comfort of this vehicle. It looks both classy and sporty. It is as comfortable as any luxury auto. And has the space of a mini van. I have found the perfect vehicle only to learn that 2008 will be its last year."
chrysler,pacifica,2004,Todd, 02/17/2009,Good solid family car,4,"I like this car. It has done everything we needed it to do. My wife and I have three young kids and the car fits them and their car seats fine (one seat had to be taken out, though). It is much safer than any minivan out there. The handling/braking of the Pacifica is very good and definitely could factor into avoiding an accident."
chrysler,pacifica,2004,shannon, 03/31/2009,I Will Never Buy Chrysler Again!,2,"I used to love my pacifica until this last Nov. 08.  The motor mounts were cracked and Chrysler was unable to provide new parts(which I would gladly pay for) to fix my car.  I searched everywhere and was unable to find the parts.  My Pacifica sat in my driveway for 5 months undriveable!  Chrysler denied my repeated request for a rental car replacement. I called Chrysler customer service every week for updates as to when the part would be available.  First I was told the part would be available in March of 09, then Feb., then March again, then April.  I finally found a mechanic who got the part for me in mexico.  I was told there are 2000 other Pacifica owners going through the same ordeal.  "

I have had the same problems that I have seen in these reviews...broken tie rods, funky noises when turning, motor mounts cracked. But I love my vehicle!!  It is so comfortable, sturdy, and solid.  I love the look inside and out, and I have enjoyed the extras.  I drive a lot, and I have put on lots of miles, but I've enjoyed it so much.  I would get another."
chrysler,pacifica,2004,Country Girl, 04/10/2009,most important feature,4,"I never expected to write a review, but after the accident I am a #1 fan of this car. Say what you want about gas mileage, rear visibility, or repairs, this car is built like a tank. A driver ran a stop sign and hit me square on the left front driver's side. His car was a total loss, I had major (but fixable) damage to the fender, headlight, and bumper. The hood was undamaged due to the height of this vehicle. The car was still running even after a major impact and my young daughter and I got out without a scratch. I had reservations about driving such a heavy car when I only need to haul more than 4 people on an occasional basis, now I am a true believer in the 5-star safety rating!"
chrysler,pacifica,2004,Paul Lowry, 04/22/2009,Best Car.,4,"This is simply the best car I've ever owned, and I've owned a broad spectrum of autos over 50 years of driving. Mine has been trouble free. I've just replaced the transmission oil cooler and had a brake job done at 49,000 miles, but that would be expected after years of trouble-free driving. I am still running on the original Michelins, but intend to get a set of new tires this year. My wife and I enjoy taking day trips in our Pacifica because we feel so safe and it is both quiet and comfortable with excellent road manners in all situations from gravel roads to freeways. The only issues are the 15 mpg around town and poor visibility due to the thick pillars. 25 MPG highway, though."
chrysler,pacifica,2004,Tonk, 05/05/2009,Still loving it!,4,Bought used in '06 w/46K - replaced brakes at 90K (1st time - $800) and just replaced relay for radiator fan ($160). Aside from klunky sound from front axel area car has been amazing.  I drive a lot and love feeling safe & secure.  Was ready to trade to newer model until read they were being discontinued.  Will probably keep it till I'm embarrassed by rust or until it just won't run...Love it!
chrysler,pacifica,2004,SharonRanae, 06/08/2009,Too Bad,3,"I purchased my Pacifica used in Feb 09 with less than 60K miles. It is a super comfortable and roomy car. I like the way it handles & love the captains seats in the 1st & 2nd row & that there are vents in every row. Less than 20 days later it needs a motor mount broke. Took it back  for the repair to find the part is on forever back order. I found one due to my own persistance. It is now June (not even 4 months since I bought the car) and it needs ANOTHER new motor mount, new tie-rods, sway arm bushings, blah blah! I haven't had it 6 months and I am trading it in.  It's too bad it has so many problems, I would love it! But I can't afford to rent a car every other month for weeks on end. "

I have had several vehicles over the course of my life, and this is by far the best I have ever had.  I was so disappointed when they discontinued the model.  "
chrysler,pacifica,2004,Still rolling in ny, 07/16/2009,Luxury for less,4,"I too had to replace what seems to be the ""defect"" items on my 2004 Pacifica. The tie rods and the Fan Relay at roughly 60,000 miles. I bought mine certified in 2006 with 19k miles on it. I now have 69000 miles. For the amount of accomodation this car offers and all the high end ammenties I am glad I bought it. The pros by far outweigh the cons. I am a car dealer and I sell foreign cars for a living. They have yet to make a non luxury brand tourer with a ride quality and creature comforts as the pacifica. Toyota just put out their overpriced offering but I will pass and keep my Pacifica until the end. As for the creaking noise, I have learned to make peace with it as you may also have to."
chrysler,pacifica,2004,Bone, 07/16/2009,I got a good one,4,"Bought car in Oct of 04 with 17k, now has 75k and still going.  The only problems I've had, power seats went out about 4 years ago, but warranty took care of it.  It does have a loud popping noise coming from front end, but they all seem to do that.  Motor mounts are now shot, but the worst is that the dealer doesn't have any, so I've been waiting since April and they are still on back order.  Other then that it's been great! Sturdy car, hit a median on the freeway in Cali going 70 mph and nothing happened, didn't even get a flat, just had to change the tie rod ends & rack, but that was my fault and warranty covered it.  One more year and it's paid for. I hope it continues to hold up."
chrysler,pacifica,2004,drenee, 07/27/2009,FAVORITE CAR,4,"We have loved owning this vehicle since the day we bought it!  I do not like driving in the snow/slush, but have felt very safe in the Pacifica AWD.  It handles VERY VERY good in the snow!  We've replaced the brakes once on it at about 60K miles.  It does burn a little oil at times - but not too bad that it worries us.  The headlights have gone out once on each side.  Otherwise, there are no problems with it.  We love how it handles & drives & would recommend it to anyone!"
chrysler,pacifica,2004,pmgrun, 08/09/2009,This car is destroying my savings!!!,3,"Purchased this car with 50k miles on it.  Since purchase is has been to the dealer for a total of about 3 weeks.  We had to rebuild the first motor, then replace it 6 months later.  Had to replace the intake manifold, motor mounts 3 separate times.  If it can break it will.  It now sits in a parking lot awaiting a tow due to it stalling while idling through the lot.  Cant get rid of this thing because its a chrysler and its worthless to the dealerships, 9k dollars upside down in the loan due to lousy blue book value."

I love the DVD player and the navagation and heated leather seats and 6 disk cd changer.  The all wheel drive makes it awsome in the snow.  I love the trunk space, I can fit a double stroller and my second stroller and still have room for my groceries, or we can empty it and go out for ice cream and sit on the edge of the back. It is reliable even thought it is in dire need of repair,  needed brakes/rotars for over 8 months and it still stops for me, I have had many noises coming from the front end and now my power stearing is going.

One complaint is I average only 16 MPG (mostly city driving). But when taking all things into consideration, it is the best car I have ever owned -- from reliability, design, comfort, and usability standpoint. I have all the options, and feel that the telematics (DVD, NAV, Satellite radio, Bluetooth) are better integrated than on my wife's new Lexus IS250.  Too bad the car was discontinued so soon!"

Interior is a bit cheesey (only 1/2 leather seats), but it's a good car for the money. We bought ours in January 04 @ $7000 below sticker. Only problems were a leaking motor mount & a blown EGR, both fixed under warranty. No strange noises but we are on our 3rd battery. My wife has a bad back & the Pacifica is one of the few cars she can travel in comfortably. Actually prefers it to our 2000 S class Mercedes for trips because of the extra room & storage.(but she isn't driving) We mostly use our car for traveling & just replaced the original tires at 54,000 miles.

Told I believe they thought I had unrealistic expectations. Mis-shifting when down shifting 60 to 80 mph. At 67,000 miles on the highway transmission failed completely. Dealer told me transmission not repairable. Fortunately had extended warranty. Now low gear shifting OK; still mis-shifts at high speeds. A bad quirky transmission. "
chrysler,pacifica,2004,Frenchr, 02/18/2008,Nice Luxury SUV at a decent price,4,I've had the Pacifica AWD for about a 1 1/2 yrs (bought it used at a decent price) and the only complaint is the gas mileage but I knew that buying it. My needs changed so I travel more now so want something similar with better MPG but can't haven't found anything I like better yet but an '07 (4.0L engine) Pacifica. I have a loaded one and don't want to give up all the features.

family of four who does all our 
traveling by car.  Higher stance than 
a traditional wagon yet you never get 
the feeling you're driving a truck or 
van.  Easily accessible third row seat 
gives each of our kids the chance 
to 'bring a friend' along to movies or 
outings, and makes arranging carpools 
much easier.  For a mom who spends a 
lot of time taxiing her kids around, 
I'm thrilled to have a comfortable and

Rouge, and absolutely love this 
vehicle. I just don't know what to 
call it--it's not an offroad SUV, nor 
a van, nor a station wagon. Chrysler 
wants us to say ""sports tourer"", but 
thats clumbsy and not really accurate. 
Tourer YES, but sporty-NOT REALLY. Two 
hundred and fifty HP is not enough to 
to make it sporty. But it handles the 
corners with surprising agility. The 
interior is very well appointed, and 
VERY wide. The exterior design is very 
appealing, as is the interior. It is a 
real head-turner. "

bought a new Concord [just because of 
the way it looked] and I loved 
it,traded it in 2002 for a Jeep grand 
cherokee , very happy with everything 
and planed to keep it for three

have enough room to comfortably lug 
around a few kids or friends yet I 
don't feel like a ""Soccer Mom"" with a 
clunky minivan. It handles well to be 
as large and heavy as it is and it has 
a wonderful sleek exterior look to it 
along with the fact that interior 
screams luxury. I think Chrysler made a 
good decision with the V6 - you have 
ample power (although not exceptional) 
along with great gas mileage.  All in 
all, I love the fact that the Pacifica 
is practical yet fun!!!!  By the way I 
only paid $34,000 for a fully loaded 
Pacifica."

ourselves because we loved the Pacifica so 
much.  Chrysler we thought? Hey that's what 
our grandparents would buy.  Boy were we 
surprised. I felt german influence as soon as I 
stepped in it.  Once we test drove them both, 
it was hands down Pacifica.  More for the $$ 
we thought.  We got it loaded, and our two 
little ones in the back are living (sitting) like

previous minivan owner and wanted 
something other than van or SUV.  After 
test driving the Pacifica, I was 
hooked. I couldn't believe how 
comfortable the ride was.  I was 
pleasantly surprised at how luxurious 
the interior was; the seats are  
comfortable and leg room is more than 
adequate.  I felt that it was a really 
well built car.  I've owned for 3 
months and can say that I really love 
it.  The attention that the car 
recieves, the comfort, the overall 
experience has been great.  "

Pacifia.  After driving it, we bought 
it a few days later.  It's fun to drive 
and very well designed.  We are very 
pleased with it.  It looks good and 
it's very practial for kids.  I would 
highly recommend it to anyone looking 
for a mini-van or SUV.  It better

You may wonder why not a ""10"" in all 
categories, then?  Well, nothing is 
perfect, including gas mileage and 
performance.  But that's not what I was 
looking for.  I was looking for a very 
dependable car that was easy on the 
eyes, had plenty of room, was under not 
outrageously priced, drove quietly and 
comfortably, was safe (the Pacifica got 
perfect 5 star ratings from the NHTSA 
crash tests), and had lots of useful 
ammenities.  After test driving the 
Volvo SUV and the Lincoln Aviator, the 
Pacifica was a no brainer.  I'm VERY 
happy and glad to see Chrysler doing 
something more upscale."
chrysler,pacifica,2004,TexMorgan, 07/31/2003,Happy New Pacifica Owners,4,"We puchased an AWD Pacifica a couple of 
weeks ago and just love it!!  What a 
lot of car for the money.  The MSRP was 
$41K but we got it for $34,977 (+$399 
D+H)  Chysler sent out a mailer for a 
free Nav System (about $1600) and we 
also got a $1K rebate from Chrysler.  
Made this quite affordable vs. the 
competition!! We have the DVD system, 
which is great for the kids!  We looked 
at the domestic and import luxury SUVs, 
but one test drive of this car, along 
with the price, and the decision was 
made!  This car gets a lot of looks on 
the road.  Power could be better, as 
others have stated, but we have no 
regrets.  "

car answered all my prayers. It has 
everything that one could possible 
imagine and different than anything out 
there. I leased this one and the dealer 
was very friendly. 2 Thumbs Up. Kids 
love it. My parents loved it. 2 other

It definitely has a European feel to it."

 Now that I have driven it for over
2,000 miles, it has grown on me.   I
feel safe and secure knowing it has
front, side and knee air bags and has
gotten 5 stars in the crash test. 
Handles beautifully but needs a little
more horse power.  Yet I do a lot of
driving with six adults in the car and
it does well.  Has a luxurious ride."
chrysler,pacifica,2004,Maldo, 08/03/2003,Pacifica AWD exceeded our expectations,5," We looked at the Volvo XC90 and the Acura 
MDX but always came back to the Pacifica.  
Five star ratings for front and side impact as 
well as the beutiful look and ride brought us 
to the dealership.  MSRP was $40.2K but 
got it for $35K.  We love it!  We find the 
acceleration more than adequate despite 
the reviews.  The cabin speaks quality and it 
is extremely quiet at highway speeds.  The 
rear bench folds flat on the cargo floor 
creating more than enough room.  A volvo 
XC90 or Acura MDX would have costed us 
over $10k more than what we paid and still 
no nav system. "

was convinced that this is the vehicle

excellent ride, many great comfort and 
convenience features and a great 
exterior appearance make this car a joy 
to drive.  Not all things are perfect

I feel that I'm driving a much higher

checked out a Pacifica on a whim, 
thinking it was out of my range in 
size and price. In the back of my 
mind, though, I've felt the third row 
of seats in a vehicle is really 
practical--especially with a family (4 
of us on my case) but I defintely 
didn't want to go the mini-van route.  
I was pleasantly surprised by the lease 
price of a Pacifica AWD, and now it's 
in my garage. I love the styling, and 
you can tell there's some Daimler in 
this Chrysler, too! I just need to get 
used to a larger vehicle than my last 
sedan (a Passat), but Chrysler 
defintely stole me away from VW, Honda, 
Nissan, and others."

chrysler,pacifica,2004,workingpowermom, 09/14/2003,I love my pacifica,4,"We were looking for a suv that could
hold more people if needed w/o the large
size but NO MINIVAN. I almost bought
another make and then the pacifica came
out. I test drove it and fell in love. I
love the way it drives and how it looks.
Not a week goes by that someone asks me
how do I like it. I went from a suv to
this and can't tell any difference in
height. It was worth the time it took me
to save the money. Can't wait for snow."

car this year, but a rear-ending 
accident, totalling my Chrysler Town 
and Country suddenly put us in the 
market. We were pretty much ready to by 
either a new mini-van (not my first 
choice) or a large SUV when my wife saw 
a commercial for the Pacifica. We 
decided to take a look over the weekend 
and halfway through the test drive, we 
were both sold. 

The Pacifica is so unique in many ways 
both my wife and I love it. And we get 
plenty of attention from the curious 
where ever we go."

is awesome and quiet, the amenities 
are great.  

We make excuses to go places just so 
we can drive in the car!

Honestly, I believe the Pacifica has 
set a new standard for SUV's and Mini 
Vans in appearance and luxury.  "

lots of comments on the exterior 
design.  Easy to get kids in and out 
of. However, have been slightly 
disappointed in the initial build

ball bearings and lift gate mechanism 
with less than 3,000 miles.  Expected 
more with this being the first true

chrysler,pacifica,2004,satisfiedpacowner, 08/06/2003,Great vehicle,4,"Chrysler definitely has a winner.  Very 
comfortable for four people, but in a 
pinch, can transport up to six.  I took 
five (tall) teenagers to Houston from 
Dallas without a whole lot of 
complaining.  There's more than meets 
the eye when it comes to room behind 
the third seat.  The outward curvature 
of the lift gate allowed more than 
expected luggage--but will need to use 
luggage rack for longer trips.  Gas 
mileage is getting better.  We have 
enjoyed our Pacifica.  It's definitely 
not a mom-mobile."

an attention-getter. The interior says 
you are special with leather enveloped 
steering wheel, controls that put you 
into the 21st century. A navigation 
system (optional), 6 CD-DVD (optional), 
and FWD or 4WD. With the click of a

an automatic, very clever. The bonus is 
knowing that Mercedes had a hand in 
building this dream ride. Test drive 
one and you will be sold. "

refreshing.  The Pacifica is easy to get in an out of, has 
great handling characteristics, adequate performance 
and it makes a statement on the road (people stop 
and stare).  The car is fun to drive!

Gas milage is not great, but that's the price you pay for 
a heavy vehicle and AWD.  Performance could be 
nicely improved by another 50 hp.

I would buy it again, knowing what I know now, 
probably a lot cheaper now than then also."

There is a sever flapping noise at 60-
70MPH under the hood. As it turns out 
it is the fender wells are not secured 
and flapping around. They tried to 
fix... still trying. If you roll down 
one rear window the buffeting noise is 
at the threshold of pain. Is sounds 
like the wheel is comming off."
chrysler,pacifica,2004,heartrok, 09/19/2003,Great Car for the $$$,4,"We are really enjoying our Pacifica.  
Lot's of room and very comfortable.  
The Pacifica feels solid and well put 
together.  Lot's of premium materials, 
and build quality is certainly at a new 
level for Chrysler.  This is the 
perfect car for a family of four who 
wants the flexibility to take the 
grandparents along every once in a 
while, but doesn't want a minivan.  The 
5 star safety ratings for front and 
side impact speak for themselves.  At 
4,700 lbs. the Pacifica should have a 
V8, but the current V6 is smooth and 
quite.  Great car.  I recommend it 
highly."

Safety isn't light.  This is by far as 
safe if not safer than a Volvo.  
Airbags for all passenger rows!!  For 
the weight of this vehicle, the engine 
is adequate for everyday driving, not 
drag racing.  The interior is very well

the horsepower. It has none! I live in 
a very mountainous area with alot of 
hills and valleys. With going uphill I 
sometime become a traffic hazard. Even 
if I downshift manually it still 
doesn't give the horsepower needed to 
stay up with the flow of traffic. The

horsepower would be the only thing to 
change in my opinion."

chrysler,pacifica,2005,Andrew, 03/26/2016,Family Truckster Update,4,"We bought new in 2005.  We now have over 165,000 miles on the vehicle - and it is going strong.  I must admit I was VERY nervous to buy this vehicle.  The engine and transmission have been flawless on this vehicle.  The one weakspot was motor mounts - replace 4 times! (but its a cheap fix).
At 100K I replaced timing belt, struts, cv joints, and alternator (due to squeaky pully).  We had to get a whole new exhaust at 130K.   The car has been with us through kids elementary/middle/high school, and has been good to move the kids in/out of college.  We even did a paper route with this car for 2 years.  I'd say we got our money out of this car.  
We replaced control arms as a preventative measure this year, and the other remaining issue is the the engine subframe rust issue on these cars.  In our case, I have been applying coatings to the affected areas - and keeping my eye on the rust progress.
My take on this ownership experience is that with proper maintenance you can even keep a Chrysler (any car) going for a very long time.
 
Update 09/28/2016: The Pacifica is still running strong with over 183,000 miles on the odometer.  At around 165,000 miles we decided to replace the o-rings between the engine timing cover and the cast iron block due to a small coolant leak from the water pump passages.   Since this work involved much disassembly, we decided to replace spark plugs, fuel injectors, water pump, timing belt, intake manifold gaskets, valve cover gaskets, all hoses, and the radiator.  Since this work was DIY, labor cost wasn't a factor, and the cost of the parts was only around $800.  We also needed to replace a rusty front subframe this year in order to pass Pennsylvania's safety inspection.  We were able to buy a rust free subframe from salvage in GA.  Total cost for replacement including our mechanic installation of 4 hrs was right around $1000.  With replacement vehicles of similar size and feature costing over $30,000, we believe these repairs were well worth the money spent, and hope to enjoy another few years of ownership.

Update 9/28/2017:
Just went over 200k ... And still rolling with the original engine and transmission.  The car is running great, but I do expect some upcoming maintenance on CV axles and possibly front bearings.  Something is making noise ... And it doesn't seem to be the tires.  Nothing is holding us back... Still taking long trips... But keeping a way eye on these maintenance items.
"
chrysler,pacifica,2005,aheflin, 07/28/2014,Warning if you purchase,4,"We fell in love with our Pacifica when we first got and would probably still love it if we did not keep having issues with it. First it was in the shop, free of charge, for most of the first 30 days we had it. The check engine light came kept coming on every 3 days after we bought it. After that we put in a new alternator. Now it needs new tie rods and ball joints. I was told we did not buy a lemon but a bad make/model. I am now trying to decide if we should put more money into it or buy a better make/model. I
was told that the next issues could be struts and transmission. Oh, and the electronic seats and passenger air bag are messed up due to a one time change in positions."

3. A little pricey considering the poor fuel economy, well known transmission and computer issues which I have experienced all of.
4. Fun to drive, and easy to handle, maneuvering through all sorts of terrain and never leaving me stranded.

We change the oil every 3k or so miles and all has been fine.
We had the brakes and
the oil pan gasket changed. We are a family of three so storage isn't a problem. Our son, though about 5'6"" still sits in the third row of seats.
My only complaint are the blind spot on the drivers side due to the rear end being so wide and the noise when the back windows are down. Chrysler should put it back into production."

Aside from that, it's a great car. I would recommend it to anyone but when asked what I don't like, I always mention the mileage. With gas prices at current levels, it's not a cheap car to run."

Unfortunately, the vehicle only met 2 out of 4 of our expectations.
Though the first 2 1/2 yrs were trouble free, the remaining 2 have been horrendous! Despite performing regular maintenance, we've had to repair/replace sensors, valves, hoses, batteries, and the entire break system.
Right now, the car is in the driveway in need of a new transmission...and it's only 6 years old! I beg you to save yourselves the trouble!

So while driving by a Used Nissan I was interested in I laid my eyes on her! The Pacifica, I test drove , got my hubby and FIL to come check it out. Everything looked great, interior was nice and polished looking. The engine and tranny sounded strong. I went home and started to do research. I was appalled by the many negative reviews. I looked at all the negative, positive and most helpful reviews. We took a look under the car and there was no rust. I ran a car fax and just knew this was no lemon. Well maintained and cared for by 2 main owners. Then sat for a while. I decided that for the price (1800) it was a steal plus it only had 157k miles. I have had it a week almost.  So far we have enjoyed the car. It needs an oil change , lower driver side control arm , a engine dip stick and hood opener. So far I have put in about 400$. Which is till great 👍. Not too bad.  Most people tend to forget these are older cars and not all will sound and run new. They had some hiccups in the beginning that seem to have been handled. I see so many Pacifica’s with over 200k miles and going!   I’m happy with my purchase and will update. So we got rid of the 05 due to bad k frame and got a 2008 Pacifica and am still in love. Nice modern features for an 08. Rear parking assist still works like a dream. Solid 1 owner car! 140k and we put in 728 and runs like a dream ❤️.

Brakes, Tie rods, Sub-frame rusted out, Engine mounts rusted out, Rear axle, Wheel bearings...
Stay Away!!!
I was interested in the new 300 sedan - but after all these problems, I'm streering clear of Chrysler again.
We bought this car used in 2008 and in 2012 it is junk with just 86000 miles."

with some of the dasboard display

components replaced in the first two

already.  The car is comfortable to 
ride in but a bit sluggish upon initial 
accelaration. It does very well in the

this SUV in the first place.  It is 
also great for kids and pets."

At 3000 miles, the oil is completely gone.  The dealer replaced the top half of the engine, but the problem is still there.  Chrysler said it is normal to have oil consumption like that.  They said there has been issues, but have no idea where the oil is going.  I had a 96' Jeep Cherokee that had 380,000 miles and never burned an ounce of oil.  Seems to me Chrysler should deal with this problem.  At 3,000 miles the engine clicks.  I loved Chrysler vehicles, but will never buy another one.  "

First, the whole top end needed to be replaced after it started overheating repeatedly. Then the radiator hose kept dislodging due to 3 motor mounts which were broken. Then the air conditioning went out, and still isn't blowing correctly. Now?? It has the ABS sensors (all 4) being replaced, and I was told it may be more than that...  Total cost?? with the extended drive train warranty?? Thousands... not to mention it is guaranteed to fail on you when you need it the most. Tow charges above and beyond AAA??--hundreds.

Finally, at 80k, w/ a lot of screaming at manager. threats of attorneys,  &  50 posts printed out of others w/ same problem, they looked into it further. Consumed 3/4 quart oil every 500mi after the first 1000mi. Finally they replaced engine. Mechanic said it was written all over engine. 3 broken motor mounts, exhaust leak, computer malfunction all not covered under top Chrysler extended warranty. $500 each repair.

First the rear brake sensors went out. This caused the cars brake pedal to grind when pushed, and sometimes, not stopping like it should. those were replaced at $200 each. Two weeks later, front sensors went out. Car has stalled 2 times while making a sharp left hand turn. Currently, front sway bar is bad, and causing a loud roaring sound while driving.

There were 4wd vehicles skidding all over the road and the Pacifica went straight up the hill and my nerves were put at ease.  This vehicle is so much fun to drive and comfort, comfort, comfort.  I would highly recommend the Pacifica to anyone who likes to have the extra room with sedan comfort and quiet ride.  I only wish we had bought one sooner."
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Bob Baxter, 12/27/2005,Diamond in the rough,4,"I researched all of the similar vehicles on the market, regardless of price, and decided that the Pacifica was the best value for us. With all the amenities that it has, it feels like a luxury vehicle. I drive a Corvette in the summer, my wife drives an MR2 Spyder - we both love the way the Pacifica handles. Now, if it can just pull our boat this summer, we will call it a winner all year long."

The Pacifica is very versatile. Long trips are a joy. Carrying our two dogs around is easy. City driving is ok with the higher point of view and quick acceleration. Great combination of style, comfort, and performance.  We also had the cutting off problem. That was scary. If you have experienced this problem, IT CAN BE FIXED! Tell the dealer that the TSB# is 18-039-05. The condition only effects 2004's and half of the 2005's. Go the NHTSA website, reference ODI# 10159114 for more info. "

replace with just regular alloy and

performance. The 4 speed transmission 
should probably be a 5 speed or offer a 
Hemi * 8 that allow for more hp and

already too poor. Overall, the interior

Just do a Edmunds vehicle comparision and you will know what I mean when looking at 40K SUV/Crossover vehicles such as the RX 330, Murano, SRX and X3. Most of all the Pacifica offers in my opinion the most unique car approach to date as far as being truely a oversized wagon that maintains its sedan like poise, while emphasizing the ""U"" in both utility and luxury with its room for 6, power lift gate, wood and leather shifter, DVD player, 400 watt stereo, reverse park, 4 heated seats, Blue Tooth, HID lights and cargo capacity. The Pacifica is truely a 6 seater wagon with out equal."

Makes me feel very safe transporting my family.  The base model had most of the features I wanted, since I really didn't need all the extra bells & whistles.  The all wheel drive has come in very handy in the Michigan winter.  It is a very nice alternative to the minivan.  I don't feel like a robot driving the same thing everyone else is.  The fuel mileage is not that great, but what do you expect with a 4000+ lb. vehicle.  Overall, I would definitely buy another one in a heartbeat."

chrysler,pacifica,2005,corvairbob, 12/10/2017,2005 chrysler pacifica,4,"gave it these marks because i have not driven it myself this is my girl's car and she likes it. but for reliability i had to lower the rating as at 100k, it turns out to have a  bunch of issues that did not turn up in the test drive.  and for the new sale price, you would think Chrysler would have made this car a bit better. it uses oil like a submarine i have slowed down the oil burning by using diesel engine oil, this leads to the cat throwing codes, a fix for that is to install a spark plug anti fouler in the rear 02 sensor to get it out of the exhaust stream and the code goes away. and the company claims it is normal but i have other cars newer and older that use zero oil between changes. so the company is just blowing smoke up our xxx fill that in. the car overall is a nice car but from what i have read online, these are now having all kinds of issues around the 100k mark. unfortunately, i failed to read up on the car before i got it for the girl and now i have to deal with all the issues. good thing i know how to fix them. but if you do not know how or you don't have friends that could help you out i would try my best to keep looking.  they have EGR issues evap issues burn oil from poor rings the transmission is said that it is not the best although i have not had that yet.  tpms is a normal issue but the dvr for the nav fails and they start having electrical issues. if yours start to get a ton of items failing look under the battery on the frame for broken grounds. they also have the engine cradle that likes to rust out faster than normal so watch out for that and if your subframe is starting to show lots of rust then spray the area with undercoating to at least slow it down.   so after a year of ownership and driving, i have to say the girl loves the car. i have replaced the brake pads all around and next year it will be due for tires but that i can't say is a car fault but had to do it anyway. the pads did look like original ones but may have been changed at the dealership so they use oem anyway. it still rides nice and so far the inside electrics are working good. the nav system still works after i cleaned the dvr unit .   update done 12-11-18



ok edmunds want me to update this so her you go this was my girls car and now it is in the junk yard she got hit and crashed it. it had to much damage to make it worth repairing for the year of the car. and with the oil burning and all the other issues I had to repair it was time to let it go.

However, from the driver's seat, I could not reach out the window comfortably without undoing my seatbelt.  The front is so compact, purses, bags, etc. are literally under your legs.  I had trouble juding distance from not being able to see over the dash very well.  The back row was general kept down for storage.  However, if we suddenly needed space for another passenger, we had to unpack and lift the seats, which was very awkward.  My daughter could not rest on long trips, because the seat would not recline all the way to sleep because of the back row being laid down for luggage."

chrysler,pacifica,2005,KMeade, 07/11/2008,Thank you,4,I had a Ford Explorer XLT and I wanted something smaller but still big and this did it for me. I like the gas and the controls on the steering wheel. I love the space and the truck lots of leg room and very comfortable. Could have done better about the backup view. But I can work it.
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Leah, 07/19/2008,Speed sensors,3,"The car is decent.  Nice style and plenty of room for a family, but I must have a lemon.  I have had my ABS sensors in all four wheels replaced 2 times and my axle has broken twice, for no reason, just city driving, to the grocery store and mall.  The first time I had the problem with the ABS sensors the car was only a few months old and its happened every year.  Now I am working on the 3rd time I must have these sensors changed and they have no clue why I keep having this problem.  Of course, now the car no longer has a warranty and I have to pay for it.  DESPITE the fact that the same work has been done 2 other times.  Just beware and be cautious."
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Pack fan, 07/23/2008,Class and room,4,I recently purchased my first Pacifica and love it. There is room like a van but stability like a sedan. Everything is at your fingertips and I average over 21 MPG. Storage is phenomenal and the ease of getting in and out helps when going anywhere with my dad. Everyone is impressed with its stylish look and the stereo rocks
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Darren, 08/05/2008,Great Vehicle to Drive,4,I have had the 2005 Pacifica for 1 month now and I am delighted to get into it each time.  It looks great and has so many amenities.  The gas mileage leaves something to be desired and it could use a bit more power but I still love it.  The blind spots that others speak of have not been an issue with me.  Grab one if you so desire.
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Donald Clark, 08/12/2008,What a Great Car,4,"I purchased the car in April in exchange for my 1999 Expedition which was hurting me from a gas cost standpoint.  The Pacifica has been very impressive.  With the interior able to seat 6 and the exterior sharp look, it is a great car.  I recently purchased some Kumbo Road Venture tires to replace the original tires.  Well now the ride is excellent.  I went on vacation about 670 miles each way and the car handled so well with great acceleration and braking power.  If you are looking for the benefits of a big SUV with better gas mileage this is it. OH yeah the trunk can  be opened and closed with the key or a switch in the car.  This part is very cool especially when you go to the grocery.  "
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Tdf, 08/18/2008,good for a family,4,"I bought our 2005 Pacifica at auction without much research but I was down to the Ford Freestyle and this.  I like the handling and comfort though it has a little lag in power sometimes. The main reason I went with it is because this is one of the only cars or minivans that accommodates 3 children in car seats. with 2 in the second row and the third in the third row. The third row kid required a little assistance with clipping her seat for about 6 months, but I fold down the second third row seat and put her into the vehicle through the hatch. Overall I get about 18-19mpg in rural driving in the foothills of NC.  "
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Moonsta, 09/10/2008,I must be dreaming!,4,"I have only had my loaded Pacifica for a couple of weeks and I don't see falling out of love with it! Solid, secure feel. Luxury plus! All the little details that Chrysler puts into some of their cars is wonderful. As other people have written, gas isn't great. But hey, it's big, it's AWD, what do you expect? I am very happy with it and mileage is about the same as my minivan. Finally I don't get asked if I have kids (no!) I waited a long time to have a car of this caliber and truthfully?? I'd buy another."
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Unhappy, 11/21/2008,Watch out!,1,"We bought this car used, was only 2 years old, fully loaded and great price. Or so we thought. Within 2 months, the handle broke from the inside, repair cost $350. Then the wheel bearings need to be replaced, $400. The the radiator hose collapsed, replacement another $180. Now the car keeps overheating when in a stand still position, repair cost unknown. Anyone else having this many problems, we've only had it a year! Many blind spots due to design, is comfy inside and kids love the DVD. Would I buy again? Never! Sticking to Chevys or Nissans, those have worked out way better for me!"
chrysler,pacifica,2005,South Dakota Owner, 12/01/2008,ABS a problem,2,"I also am having problems with the ABS brake system.  The car only has 38,000 miles and the ABS brake system is failing.  I've already had worn out tire rods replaced and the electronic drivers side seat failed.  I am regretting purchasing this car.  It is too new to be having these problems."
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Watermaster, 12/18/2008,Great all around vehicle,4,"I was ready to trade my van for a convertible sports car but, with a teenage son who plays drums and needed transportation to college, I gave into a large capacity vehicle. I made a great choice. The Pacifica holds a ton of stuff while providing the feel of a luxury sedan. It drives great, has an outstanding dashboard and electronics inventory, leather, wood trim etc. I can also get 22 bags of mulch into it any time I need to."
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Lisa, 12/31/2007,Got Oil?,3,"I love the style of the car and all of the features are wonderful!  The DVD/suround sound is also a good feature.  Having 6 seats is also an added bonus, but with all of that being said, my car burns more than 1 qt. of oil in about 800 miles.  This has been verified twice by the dealership and Chrysler refuses to deal with the problem."
chrysler,pacifica,2005,laservision, 12/29/2007,Perfect for Us,4,"My wife had a spinal fusion and needed a vehicle that would have easy ingress and exit, give excellent back support and have a smooth, smooth ride. The Pacifica fit the bill on all accounts. The seats are very supportive and adjust to any posture. The ride is buttery smooth, even over the most potholed of Michigan roads, but the car rides flat on curves- no rolling typical of a large American car. We are very impressed by the build quality and interior materials. No plasticky feel or cheap-feeling surfaces. On the downside, the gas mileage is pretty bad with a huge range- from 13.5 city to 22 highway. The sound system has a lot of bells and whistles but the sound is rather poor."
chrysler,pacifica,2005,BeachDriver, 03/16/2009,Most bang for your buck,4,"After hours of internet research and days of test driving vehicles, I finally purchased the Pacifica. I'm so happy with this crossover, or is it a small minivan? Nobody really knows what to call it, but I call it awesome! It's so luxurious, sometimes I forget I'm not driving a high end sedan. It rides smooth, my 3 kids fit in it comfortably as well as my husband and I with room for our baggage. Posh extras like 1st and 2nd row heated seats make it truly the best bang for your buck. The only con I can think of is it's hard to see the lower part of the road clearly when you back up, so be sure to check behind you before you get in. I really love this car."
chrysler,pacifica,2005,trade in,trade up,trade in trade up,4,"I traded a Dodge 1500 pick up. I am in the army and do a lot driving from state to state. The pacifica is great to drive and comfortable to ride in. I can still pull my 22 ft. Mako boat on the weekends, while driving me and 5 of my fishing buddies in comfort. I don't miss the gas I had to put in the pick-up."
chrysler,pacifica,2005,michael bratcher , 04/16/2009,this car is junk,2,"when we purchased this vehicle,we were hoping for it to be the last one for a long time.Know we are falling back into the same situation again.The car has been nothing but trouble,we had to have the front tierods replaced at only 36000 miles,and it has been burning a half a quart of oil between oil changes and know the egr valve is going out with only 46000 miles on it.I don't know if there is anything that can be done about this but I would really like to know."
chrysler,pacifica,2005,vamfrank, 05/02/2009,Simply Amazing SUV,4,"I simply love this car. Solid , reliable, and great looks. It is like driving a Mercedez with a chrysler logo. I was a bit reluctant to go with an American car, but no regrets. I am still amazed at my car. Pure luxury"
chrysler,pacifica,2005,antrod, 01/13/2008,Oil Eater!,3,"I love the styling and the third row seat, but that is it! My biggest complaint is that it runs out of oil at 3500 miles. Chrysler claims that 1 quart every 1000 miles is within ""normal parameters"" and they can't seem to find my car's problem and claim it is ""within their parameters"". They voided my warranty after 3500 miles between an oil change which is over the recommended 3000 Miles. 3500-4000 between changes should be no problem. Yet this car was almost dry at 3500, 4.5 out of 5 quarts low! They see that a car may have a major problem and will find what ever it takes to not stand behind the vehicle. 3500 and it's void and your problem and your cost despite the $2000 warranty we bought."
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Chowguy, 06/28/2009,Excellent BUT!,4,"Car now has 42,000 miles. Thus far I'm pleased except for the following issues. Have replaced 3 batteries. They just go dead in the garage. No reason that I can see. Have replaced the backup sensor utility which was under warranty thank goodness. Car is fun to drive but does have some ""blindspots"" you need to be careful with. The battery issues is a puzzling one that just nags at me. "
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Brent, 07/10/2009,Poor Build Quality (Lots of repairs),2,"We've owned this vehicle for close to 4 years and have had many problems. Two ABS wheel sensors have gone bad & have been replaced ($150 ea). The EGR Valve went bad, but a $4 can of carburetor cleaner & a set of tools with 15 minutes under the hood fixed that problem. The EGR Valve would have cost about $250 at the dealer. Both rear windows needed the regulators replaced ($300 ea). The front left CV Joint needed to be replaced ($200). Most of the wheel bolts have broken off and needed replacement. Our gas mileage is poor 15 / 19 mpg. If this car was more reliable, we would really like it. It is great on long trips & has plenty of room. Now I wish Honda or Toyota had built our car!"
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Kiddles, 08/03/2009,Gas Mileage,4,"I recently bought a 2005 Chrysler Pacifica under the impression from the dealers information that around town, the car gets 17 mpg and 22 on highway.  I found by tracking that I'm only getting 13-14 mpg.  When I questioned the dealer, they said it was a rough estimate.  To me, 15-16 would be a rough estimate."
chrysler,pacifica,2005,zion, 08/14/2009,It was nothing but trouble.,3,"My first Chrysler product - off-lease with only 20K miles! Overall we have enjoyed the car interior features, BUT: for the first two months I drove car only once - from a dealer, and the rest - car was in repairs; battery died (less than 3 years old); could not move a shifter from parking position  little plastic part got broken (under- engineered); engine light and ""gas cap"" message came on - EVAP system problem /leak; ABS light came on and stayed means ABS was disengaged - probably bad sensors; two tires started slow leaking air and tire-shop mechanic pointed out on micro cracks (expensive Michelin tires!); I lost my feeling of safety; customer service virtually not existed."
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Badchkam, 08/26/2009,Don't Buy It!!,3,"If you don't mind the possibility of engine problems then I guess this car is ok, but any Mfg that thinks it is ok for the engine to burn a quart of oil every 1000 miles is out of their mind! I don't like the idea of buying a new engine that we are now faced with since the low oil censor light also failed to work!"
chrysler,pacifica,2005,justlivinlife, 08/24/2009,I love my Pacifica,4,"I bought my 2005 Touring Pacifica in June of 2005, and have love it ever since.  I have put 95,000 miles on, It has not had any mechanical problems.  It actually needs it's first repair, which is why I'm online looking for information.  The Pacifica needs a EGR sensor. I only have one issue with it.  With just one child at home now, I feel that it is too big. "
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Cassandra, 09/05/2009,Never Again.......,2,"After my beloved '97 Explorer went into the shop yet again, I began to look for a new vehicle. My needs were gas mileage, interior room and ample storage. I liked the looks of the Pacifica and really liked the 25 mpg on the sticker. Well, the gas mileage runs about 16 mpg and it spent the first 3 months in and out of the shop including and a new transmission, abs sensor and on and on. Let's not even talk about the people I've cut off on the highway in the blind spot(s). Would I buy another? No way."
chrysler,pacifica,2005,chocolategirl, 09/19/2009,I need to trade it,3,"I bought this car in 2006 after renting one and trading in a 2001 Ford minivan. I thought that this was gonna be a long lasting relationship with this car but I have already replaced both axles, and in 2008 I stayed at the shop with it. Now I took it back about a week ago to the dealership because I heard a humming sound and no air along with water hitting my left foot. As soon as I can I am done with Chrysler cars."
chrysler,pacifica,2005,spartyjim, 09/29/2009,Nice Vehicle,4,"We bought this car new. One unique problem that was fixed even though the car was out of warranty. Headliner buckled and was replaced. No mechanical problems, it drives very nice and the ride is smooth. A problem common to all SUV's I've had is the side visibilty. Pillars make you have to look carefully. Highway mileage is over 21 mpg with air on at over 75MPH. No oil use like some others say. We have the small V6"
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Pete, 12/18/2009,Road Dog,3,"So far so good knock on wood based on other reviews own over 14 months no problems to speak of, excellent vehicle for long road trips especially if you dvd pkg. "
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Renee, 01/20/2010,Buy New,4,"We bought a certified used car. It has had more problems then my 2001 Honda, and needed a new battery before the Honda. It is nice to have the seat warmers, DVD for the kids, but not sure the trade-off of having to take it to the dealership at least 2x a year is worth it."
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Bill, 02/03/2010,Was great while it lasted,3,"Purchased car originally in Nov 2004. First time we purchased American and was really hoping car would last 8-10 years. Had all the maintenance performed at regular intervals. In Dec 2009 check engine light came on. Apparently a TSB for engine sludge if car is mainly driven in city (as my wife has). Now car bucks and hesitates. We've had it back multiple times and now have given up and purchasing a new one, as this is our people mover and the check engine light will not go off. Overall, the interior of the car was very nice. Seats were comfortable and material quality good, but after we had our third child, the 2/2/2 seating was a problem- although not Chryslers fault. Great while lasted..but"
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Shon, 03/13/2010,I was wonder what that problem was!,4,"I bought the car in April of 09, I thought it was beautiful inside and out. It had about 33000 mi on it then and about 43000 now. I didn't have frequent oil changes because the car was constantly eating up oil. I couldn't figure it out, I didn't have any evidence of oil leaks in my driveway. But know that I have read some of the reviews I see that this is a standard problem along with cracks in the tires, the visibility issue with the pillars, and the noise that is heard when the back windows are down (horrible). I love my car, but I think I'm gonna take it easy on it until I can sadly trade it in for something else. I have had many lemon vehicles in the past, so I want out before it gets worse."
chrysler,pacifica,2005,pianoman, 03/04/2010,We got a good one,4,"We are very happy with our Pacifica and have owned it almost 5 years (80K) now with never an non-maintenance repair (replaced all rotors and pads from Brake Planet at 60K mi for under $200). Once a window quit working that was left open in the rain, but it repaired itself after a couple days. It cruises at 75-80 mph all day and gets 22-23 mpg, 60 mph gets 25-26 mpg. Town is 20-21 mpg. We have the 3.5L touring.  We pull a 2000lb boat with no problems. It has a very sturdy chassis. We have noticed oil consumption, but as I read on here years ago, just check the oil. We change oil every 3000 mi. Wife is happy and never wants another car. Ours is a good one, others on here were not so fortunate."
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Beary Love, 03/11/2010,Nice car,4,"We bought Pacifica in July of 2005 brand new. Fell in love with it right away, needed a large car for the family. We follow the maintenance schedule of the car manual services like oil change every 3000 miles, etc. NEVER had a problem with it yet. Very reliable! NEVER had a problem with oil or anything else. The only thing would like to have different is a better mpg. Otherwise it has been a great car for us from the beginning."
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Sean, 03/23/2010,Great Value for Money,4,"I bought my 2005 touring model last year (2009). Although 4 years old when I got it with 79k on the odometer, bless the previous owner who obviously loved this car. In addition to the luxurious interior, comfort, quiet ride, great styling & road presence, I git it at a great price at $11,000 with 21,000 km left on the warranty. I purchased an additional bumper to bumper warranty for 2 years and never had to use it, thank God, based on some of the horror stories I've read here. The fact that Mercedes Benz had a key role in design and building this beauty is apparent in road handling and styling. Overall, I am very happy with my Pacifica or 'Fica' as my 5 year-old daughter lovingly calls it!"
chrysler,pacifica,2005,PAUL, 12/05/2004,Breakdown,4,"I started my trip from texas and brokedown in ind., With a grinding in the right front wheel. The dealer said that i should not be driving the car, with 3000 miles on it. They gave me a rental but was without the car for three days because they had to order the whole front wheel. We also had water dripping on my wifes foot from the air. Cond. They replaced the filter and filter door. It is still leaking with 9,000 miles and the dealer said that i should change the temp. In the car to correct the problem? We also had an emissions pump go bad with 8,000 miles and had to spend four hours at the dealers waiting for them to get the part from some other dealer."
chrysler,pacifica,2005,TBrown, 12/16/2004,Love our 2005 Touring FWD,5,"We've owned this car just over two weeks, and we love it.  We still have lots to learn about this vehicle, in terms of manipulating all of the controls which are readily available at your finger tips from either front seat.  The overall interior design is excellent, with only a couple minor exceptions/possible improvements.  If you have kids and you don't like minivans, you need to look at the Pacifica with 3rd row seating.  From the standpoint of vision, the Pacifica feels more like a SUV because you sit higher than you would in a sedan, but it drives like a sedan.  As a driver you feel safer, but not intimidated behind the wheel.  Backing up in tight spaces is taking some getting used to."
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Dag, 12/16/2004,Happy Owner - first Chrysler,4,"I bought this car for my wife as safety and cargo were two of the biggest concerns when we were shopping.  I can't believe how quiet this car is when driving on the road.  Our baby loves it and falls to sleep the second we drive off.  The grip to the road feels tight and acceleration is smooth.    The car does not feel large and also sits higher than a regular car (not as high as larger SUV).  Gas mileage is adequeate at best and fortunately only requires regular.  We now have 1,350 miles and are averaging 14.9/gallon.  I hope it gets better as the car breaks in more. We know two other couples who have since bought the car.  "
chrysler,pacifica,2005,bbillnana2, 01/10/2005,Great car!!,5,"The new 5 seater is great! You have all the comfort of a wagon/SUV, but with a sleek design. Drives excellent, plenty of cargo space, and looks cool!! I give this car an A+!!"
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Roundup, 01/10/2005,2005 Pac Signature Series AWD,4,"Excellent car, but as usual, poor visiblility out of back glass. Height is way too low on all armrest. Gas mileage is subpar. Needs to be able to toggle average miles per gallon. HID lights are nice for flat roads, but not on twisty roads. Too isolated of a beam. Seats need be longer."
chrysler,pacifica,2005,2005 Pac Owner, 01/29/2005,2005 Touring AWD - Very Pleased,4,I've driven 3000 miles and I am extremely happy with this auto. A third of these miles have been driven in bad Winter weather. The Pacifica with AWD has handled these Winter condition better than I expected. Far better than my previous SUV. The road handling is exceptional. I have never felt safer in an automobile.  The engine power has incresed substantially since the first 1500 miles. It has plenty under the hood. I do not understand the reviews that complain about the lack of power. I drive on hilly roads and the Pacifica has plenty of get up an go. I have averaged 19.4 MPG after the first 1000 miles. This is all Winter driving with a mix of city and highway. Not too bad.
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Bensonb521, 02/12/2005,Pacifica rocks!!!,4,"Traded off a 2002 Lexus RX300 and all I can say is WOW!!  Daimler-Chrysler has a real winner here!  Safety went into everything.  Roomy cabin with excellent trim and driver features.  Travels through Ice/Snow with ease and makes me feel all ""fuzzy"" inside.  Turns heads and makes me feel good!  Nobody has anything over on the Pacifica.  Sorry Toyota/Lexus and anyone else trying to compete!"
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Don, 02/12/2005,New car,4,"In first 1000 miles had to take car back 6 times to get ""Free DVD"" system to operate correctly.  Car came with DVD in dash from factory and Dealer advertised ""Free DVD Monitor"" with sale. What I was not told was the monitor was not going to be a Chrysler unit but a cheap aftermarket. I found out the hard way that it does not turn off when folded back up and the key is off.  Had to jump car twice before found out what was running battery down. Also had Uconnect system installed and its phone book feature does not work very well. Uconnect does a good job of receiving calls but makes entering items in the phone book very hard."
chrysler,pacifica,2005,LJ Willoughby, 02/13/2005,My New Ride,4,"I own an area rug store and had to have a large enough vehicle to make home deliveries when the van was out. Wow, I can get a 10'x 13' rug in with no problem. The Pacifica offers more room & comfort as well as it handles and rides better than any vans or SUV's I have driven. Another plus is the body design, it can even make those of us in ""40 something"" age group still look good.   "
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Rusty P., 03/02/2005,Enjoyable ride for a family car,4,"We purchased the Pacifica 5 months ago because of its interior room and styling.  With 3 children (ages 15, 16, 20), we needed something that was comfortable for a family of 5 adults and the Pacifica delivered comfort for all.  It has a very smooth ride and the handling is outstanding, especially for a vehicle that large.  The feel on the road is solid.  Acceleration from a stop is not impressive, but once the car gets moving, acceleration is excellent.  Cargo space with all of the seats in use is limited, but each of the 4 seats fold out of the way independently, giving you lots of options.  Gas mileage is consistent- about 19 mpg in mixed city driving.  There have been no reliability issues"
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Geoff, 03/17/2005,Loyal Chrysler Buyer,3,"This SUV drives and handles more like a car but has a SUV feel. Easy to navigate, comfortable on trips but needs additional stowage behind 3rd row seat. Fuel economy is accurate except in mountainous terrian. Is pricer than a Van with fewer passanger space and stowage area. Improve 3rd row seating to accomodate adults."
chrysler,pacifica,2005,EILISH, 03/29/2005,I love my pacifica,4,"I love my pacifica, it handels the snow better than my husbands suburban.  A little small for large families,  i only have two children.   "
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Will, 04/01/2005,Unrecognized value and performance,4,"This is a well planned vehicle from bumper to bumper. There is nothing that is not within easy reach of the driver. The options are super, with the GPS put in the proper spot, right on the speedometer display! Seats could fold a little flatter, but the third seats drop down very easy. We have riden with 7-8 passengers. Eight is a little tight, but no one complained.  I have looked at them all. This car, known for its safety, has all the extras of a luxury car. "
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Scott Willard, 04/13/2005,Solid,5,"More then we ever expected.  Looks small from outside, but 4 adults fit very comfortable.  I'm 6'4"" and fit fine in all seats.  We love it."

chrysler,pacifica,2005,David, 05/04/2005,The Luxury SUV that Jeep should have....,4,"I have had my Pacifica since 2/1/05.  I have about 1,900 miles on it now and I LOVE driving it.  I had a 99 Jeep Grand Cherokee which I loved, but wanted more luxury inside a better ride and better handling,  with All Wheel Drive.  ""BAM""  out comes the 2005 pacifica to fill the bill. This has to be my most favorite vehicle to date.  It does all the SUV and Van things, has almost all the goodies you could want, but it looks and rides like an expensive luxury machine. Dare I say Mercedes ? Easy enter and exit, awesome leather interior, as much cargo room as my jeep with the third row seats down and super handling on snow and icy roads.  THUMBS UP Chrysler.. NICE JOB !"
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Walt, 05/27/2005,Best family car,5,"This is the best tribe mobile I have ever owned. After a dozen years of driving Caravans as the family vehicle this is a great compromise. It rides as good as my friends caddy, has plenty of space and is fun to drive. Even after a year and a half the magic still has not warn off. My Vette is even getting jealous of the time I spend driving the Pacifica. Three the family members now own one. My father-in-law even got the same car, color and options. During a family event last weekend it was wild to see 4 of them in my driveway! "
chrysler,pacifica,2005,k9fto, 05/27/2005,Initial checkride,4,"We traded an Isuzu rodeo for this car and are very happy.  The car/suv rides very nice and the fit and finish are much, much better than any other american offering.  The mileage is good and the engine feels strong.  Only complaint is the view down the right side of the car since the rear end is cavernous.  There is room to spare with the 3rd row of seats lowered.  I lug around sports gear for kids and this thing is a joy to load and unload.  The small touches done on the inside are nice and the dash is clean and easy to read. "
chrysler,pacifica,2005,KJ, 05/31/2005,Don't Pass the Base Model!,4,"When it comes to value, don't miss the value offered in the BASE model of the Pacifica.  Add the leather package for under $2,000 and you have a wonderful and opulent ride you can own for something under $22,500. with incentives!  The car looks like a million and is priced like a VW. As for ride, you wouldn't want anything better for a family vehicle. If you fold down the second row seats you can almost put a washer and dryer inside!  The view from the driver's seat is all encompassing and there is NOTHING blocking your forward vision. With the base model you get so much as standard equipment why pay more for the higher priced models? "
chrysler,pacifica,2005,cfhair2003, 06/08/2005,What i don't like,4,"My control arms right and left side had to be replaced before 10,000 miles. Bushing were noisy when braking, or turning. Console gearshift has a chessey, stainable cover.Stains (soda,coffee), of any kind can not be removed.I'm replacing mine with the other flat configuration, which are on later models.$50.00 cost.I don't care for the transmissions shifting, which could be just me. It's the same as my 140,000. mile Nissan Maxima."
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Mperon93, 06/11/2005,One for GEN'X,4,It is the perfect car for the non- minivan yet not another car person.  To me all cars today look alike.  I wanted something that stands out.  This car does.  You get the feeling of a sports car via the and yet there is enough room for the kids like in a mini-van.  It took me a while to find a car that would satisfy all of my driving needs and this car definetly did it.
chrysler,pacifica,2005,MARY L., 06/12/2005,What a great vehicle!!,4,"I have loved driving this automobile since i took my test drive - knew i had to have it.  Rides like a dream.  I own the 2005 4wd touring edition, loaded but without the navigation system. Had some minor glitches (sunroof rattle, squeaky engine belt) that needed fixing, but this car still makes me enjoy driving everyday i get in it.  "
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Linda Huffman, 06/12/2005,Pacifica Review,4,Visibility poor.  Too many blind spots and back window much too high and small.  Center console not designed for the convenience of the driver.  Road noise when windows are up is a disapointment.
chrysler,pacifica,2005,spagal, 06/27/2005,Fun vehicle to drive,4,"I think its a great car overall. It does have some mechanical problems off the bat such as faulty window switch and a noise under the hood that they cannot seem to find the problem. Overall a very fun car to drive lots of extras! The body design is nice as well as the interior color and layout. Not a lot of trunk space if using all passenger seats in back. In fact, one large suitcase is all it will hold. "
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Gary Skiles, 07/09/2005,my new car,4,This is one great car the looks inside and out the way it handles and just the total comfort of interior
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Elmodorph, 07/23/2005,I dont feel safe in a Pacifica,3,The I almost died part. after driving 70 miles I got off the freeway and stopped at a stop sign when I went to go the car went and stalled in the middle of two lanes of a four lane state higway.  I had two trucks lock up their brakes and I saw my life flash before me.  Luckily they did not hit me and they just had selective hand signals for me.  At first I though that perhaps it was my mistake.  About 20 min later it did the exact same thing I stopped at a stop sign started to go and the vehicle stalled.  I drove the car for another 130 miles and it did not occur again. The engine light did not come either time.
chrysler,pacifica,2005,mark, 07/25/2005,new pacifica,4,"car is comfortable to drive but is very hard to see your surroundings when backing out of parking spaces and such. The fuel economy is terrible, only getting about 12 around town and 18 to 19 on the highway.The car should be great in the winter with AWD. It has plenty of room for all passengers and like the heated seats for all."
chrysler,pacifica,2005,ikoco, 08/13/2005,Rides and Handles Like A Dream,4,"The Pacifica was the perfect car for me. The ride and handling are really impressive. Most of my driving is inner city and my SUV handles like a sports car while darting in and out of traffic. The suspension is firm enough to corner well, but still smooth enough for the sunken streets and potholes of New Orleans.  I have carried five full sized teenage boys across Louisiana to playoff basketball games in comfort. The rear seats offer ample head and leg room.  The Infinity surround sound system and DVD player provides the highest fidelity of all the other autos I test drove.  My 3.8L engines allows me to pass just about everything on the road but a gas station. I get 16/24 MPG."
chrysler,pacifica,2005,leith, 08/13/2005,a different car,4,"it is somewhat weird car.  it is very good and relibale, but weird.  excellent acceleration and wonderful comfort.  plenty of comfort features, the seats for the driver are GREAT"
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Carl Scarborough, 08/14/2005,Pacifica 2005,4,"This is the second year I have utilized a Pacifica as my primary car, having had the 2004 initial model also.  Aside from required maintenance, only minor repairs have been required.  The 2004 model needed a warranty covered computer chip replacement, and the 2005 had a recall to replace headlight wireing."
chrysler,pacifica,2005,newjmark, 08/16/2005,All is good but visibility,4,"I enjoy the car and unique style, but that style causes a problem with visibility.  If you get the car get a back up sensor to assist in getting out of tight parking places.  In addition the stereo system is a bit difficult to figure out."
chrysler,pacifica,2005,therese mattingly, 08/27/2005,love my car,4,"i traded my chrysler mini van in for the pacifica, and could not be happier. i feel like i am in a sports car. rides and handles awesome. i would highly recommend this car."
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Robert, 10/23/2005,Worth It,5,"This is the first new car we bought since our marriage 12 years ago.  My wife wanted a 300C, but I wanted the Dodge Magnum.  Finally, after consideration for our kids and long- distance traveling, practicality took hold and we ""settled"" on a loaded Pacifica, but what a great choice we made!  I just returned from our latest trip to Eureka Springs, AR from our home in Oklahoma.  The wife & kids had a great time but the most fun I had was driving on extremely steep, windy roads.  I was astonished at how effortlessly the car took to the road.  I passed several vehicles going as fast as they dared.  I got 19.2 mpg for the 273 mile roundtrip, but 23.6 mpg on  return leg by keeping speeds < 65 mph"
chrysler,pacifica,2005,tmcdaniels, 10/29/2005,Kool Pac,4,"I have had this car for three weeks and 3,000 miles now.  Not a problem, drives like a dream, not too bad on gas for such a heavy car. 19 city and 25 highway.  Drives like my volvo and rides better than my caddy.  I love this car.  Good quality fit and finish"
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Angela, 11/04/2005,No more luxury cars for me,4,"This car suits my needs perfectly. I had an Expedition, but it was too big. A van, but it was a VAN, luxury sedans, but I felt I had to be so neat and careful in them. This car is huge inside, tons of leg room, when using the autostick, you get a lot more get up and go and can zip in and out of traffic much better! I love that if I leave lights on, it shuts them off. DVD system separate from CD system ROCKS..."
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Bob Brooks, 12/09/2005,My Pacifica,4,"To this point , 10,000 miles, I have had little or no problems with the vehicle.  This is our 4th Chrysler and the only rap is with the gas mileage.  I think the Chrysler engineers could have improved the mileage by changing the gear ratios as I have noticed the rpms are higher in the Pacifica than in my 96 and 01 sedans.    Other than that, I think it's one of the sharpest SUV designs around."
chrysler,pacifica,2005,JimD, 12/14/2005,A really nice car,5,"Have owned lots of cars.  My wife says this is the nicest car we have ever had.  Traded in a Mountaineer because the ride was harsh, loud, and wobbly.  This Pacifica feels glued down, it is so stable, and what a great ride, and so quiet.  Lots of room, and a luxury feel to everything.  So far, we are really happy with the car.  Mileage on the highway is about 22-can't complain."
chrysler,pacifica,2005,SweetWin7, 12/29/2005,A GREAT vehicle,4,"The AWD Pacifica is the best vehicle. I notice that it is missing from many reviews, and frankly I think that the reviewers are missing the mark on this one.  This car is comfortable, is solid and responsive on the road and with the side curtain airbags in all three rows has the competition beat hands down for safety. When it comes to 5 star ratings, all ratings are basically in comparison to other vehicles in the same weight class.  The physics of momentum and energy exchange, tell us that the heavier your vehicle is, the better it will fare on impact. Side & head air bags for all passengers is a necessary option for any vehicle. There is NO gov't rollover warning on the visors of this car!"
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Trammell, 01/04/2006,pacificia rating 8.5,3,"The look really got my attention. The only draw back to me is there is not a lot of front row room for the driver and passenger. I feel chrysler should take out the third row seat,that way the could make more room up front. Other than that I love my pacificia.              "
chrysler,pacifica,2005,janrnowicki, 01/10/2006,pacifica,4,I am 67 years old and have had many vehicles. The Chrysler Pacifica is the most beautiful comfortable vehicle that I ever owned. My wife had a back operation 7 years and comfort is very important. The Pacifica fullfills all the comforts that my wife's back requires.It even rides smoother than our 3 previous Buicks. The exterior and interior looks far surprass al other vehicles.
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Help, 02/03/2006,chryslerc error pacifica 2005,3,car was alright for the  1t few days .. within a month i started having problems with it .    while  driving the  car  would  shut off... in the middle of the road or no matter where im at   the car would   shut off completely had a few close calls.. its a very scary thing    the steering wheel starts  to  be very difficult  to control it locks and  the  car turns off.. took it back to car dealer  they cannot find anything ... this   has happened  3-4 times so far ... called  chrysler directly  they  did nothing....  would like to know if anyone else had similar experiences. thank   you
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Mc_Lani, 02/07/2006,I Love This Vehicle,4,"After about a year of car shopping, the Pacifica caught our eye.  The reviews were ""so-so"" and I hadn't really seen any around.  After a test drive and more shopping around, we agreed this was the choice for us. It's as dreamy owning one as I'd hoped.  At first, there were blindspots in the rear corners, but now I'm accustomed to using my side mirrors and being more cautious (which is a good thing anyway, right?). Wish the gas mileage were better - wish ALL vehicle gas mileage were better!  If you have a large family, this isn't your car (the second row seats fold up and you really don't want to climb over).  We have a family of 4 and it fits like a glove. We can't wait to take a roadtrip!!"
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Ken R, 02/08/2006,Pretty good vehicle,3,So far the Pacifica has performed pretty well.  My wife drove it for the first 3 months that we've had it but she has issues with seeing out the back.  We just got a Chrysler Town and Country. I now drive the Pacifica.  It replaces the Pontiac Grand Prix GTP that I have been driving for the last few years.  The Grand Prix performed much better than the Pacifica but is no where near as comfortable as the Pacifica.  
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Heather Moraitis, 02/24/2006,Stalls While Driving,2,"I have had this car for 2 months and it stalls while I am driving. The power steering freezes and I cannot maneuver the car. It has happened around town and while I was on the interstate. I am fortunate I have not been seriously injured along with my 2 children. The dealership cannot identify the problem and therefore says that nothing is wrong. I am taking steps towards filing a lemon law complaint. I am trying to get help from Chrysler, but the customer service representative told me there is nothing they can do unless they can determine the problem."
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Kedrinscott, 03/14/2006,Handles Great,4,"We live in Palm Beach County, Florida and as evryone who lives here it can ran pretty heavy and This Car can handle driving threw the worst of down pours, You can drive threw a puttle doing 45mph and the car will not hydro- plane. The only problem is that sometime the car stalls for no reason and the paint chips easy and the roof rack makes noise when driving. Other that that we love it.."
chrysler,pacifica,2005,erisim0217, 04/21/2006,Loved the Interior Comfort,4,"I liked the ride better than the Jeep Gr Cher and for the price we got all the bells and whistles for what we would have pd for base Jeep.  3rd row a bit too cramped for adults.  I hate it being compared to a minivan.  We are mid 30s no kids and still want to look cool which I think we do.  We've driven it on a few 300-500mile trips and was very comfy and handled great.  Not a great veh if your looking for speed or off roading but was great for freeway and city driving.  Last trip got about 24mpg.  We originally wanted a Chry 300.  Again, the interior of the Pac was much more comfortable and came w/ DVD, Navigation, Sirrus, H Leather, Snrf,auto liftgate,homelink and more for under base 300  "
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Woody Mills, 07/02/2006,Style and Fun,5,"The Pacifica is stylish and fun to drive.  With the onboard nav. system, at a glance of the speedometer cluster you can see the map without looking toward the center radio location as on most models.  With fuel prices soaring, the average I get around town is about 20, and on a trip 28.  There is power if I need it and economy too."
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Joleen Breitbach, 07/09/2006,noise,3,Bad Noise when back windows are down partway and front windows are up.  Creates a noise loud enough to break your eardrums.  Almost had an accident on highway.  Thought I blew a tire.
chrysler,pacifica,2005,mt, 07/24/2006,I like it,4,The Pacifica is an enjoyable car to drive and ride in.  Great for long trips.
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Happy Customer, 08/03/2006,Wonderful,4,"I received the Pacifica for my fist car last year and I absolutely love it! Even being a teenager I don't regret picking this over another car. The handling and performance are great. Interior quality and appearance are superb. One of the best buys you can get for the space, luxury, and overall satisfaction. A definite must for anyone looking in this class of SUV"
chrysler,pacifica,2005,Andrea, 08/07/2006,Happy New Owner!,3,"Just purchased the Pacifica after comparing to Highlander, Pilot and Volvo XC90.  Love it!  You definitely get more for your money with the Pacifica.  A used XC90 came in a close second but after reading the reviews on Edmunds decided against it.  We drove a Tahoe for many years and are now happy to find a ""car"" that fits our needs with snow, kids and sports.  "
chrysler,pacifica,2005,D Mays, 08/19/2006,We love it,4,"We have 2 children, one of which is at the age where she wants to have friends along.  We needed a vehicle that could comfortably hold 6 people, yet we didn't want a mini-van.  This is the ideal vehicle for this!"

in excellent condition,fit finish ect 
was very good was very inpressed with 
the quaility of the exterior finish,the 
interior was good but I found that the 
materials were somewhat cheap looking 
for a ar of this price range. The 
engine could use more power still too 
early to tell what kind of fuel mileage 
but it seems to be fairly good. Outside 
mirrors should be larger and there are 
no conoring lights,HID lights could not 
be ordered for 2005,I was also not 
impressed with the upgraded audio 
system,only problem that I found was a 
loose button on the radio.

have experienced in my 60+ years.  It 
is a joy to drive and a pleasure to 
ride in.  Much to my dismay it was 
broadsided - at 30-35 mph- other party 
did not apply brakes.  The safety of 
this vehicle is amazing.  The 
reinforcement bars protected people 
from injury and the interior of the 
vehicle.  Crash rating should be 5 
stars.  I love this vehicle and hope to 
have it for a long time"

more ""climbing in"" to the car either. 
Handling of the car is great. 
Everything needed by the driver is 
easily accessable. Feel safe in the 
vehicle too! No complaints from any 
rear passengers - comfortable ride all 
around. Gas mileage actually getting 
better the more it's driven. Not 
looking for a car to race around in, 
rather getting a car with more comfort

you'll like it!"

suv that I didn't need a ladder to get 
in. Drove  a lot of the 2004 models, 
They all had the suv dumpy ride on the 
passenger side and back seats with the 
exception of the Acura and Cadillac.  
Lexus is far too small for more than 2 
passengers until you go to their very 
high priced model, found that with most 
I tried.  I didn't need or want all the 
bells and whistles except safety 
features i.e. air bags.  The Pacifica 
Touring 2005 is perfect for me."

just finished the 300 mile break-in. I 
think it is a beautiful blend of 
comfort and style. Drives nicely and 
ride feels good, but does lug a bit 
when picking up speed at on ramps. It 
is a large car, but I feel extremely 
safe in it. I love the many features it 
has - it seems to me everything you can 
imagine. The first time I test drove I 
felt some knobs etc. seemed a little 
cheap even though they looked nice but 
was comparing to a friends 150K 
mercedes sports car, so go figure.  
I'm  liking the whole package and the 
leather interior is very nice! I do 
park further away to make sure I can 
exit easily! Will update review after a 
few thousand miles. "

it, up to now you couldn't pay me to 
own a Chrysler. We went on vacation in 
June and the Pacifica was available as 
a rental. I figured we'd drive it for a 
couple of weeks and that would get it 
out of my wife's system. Then we could 
get on with buying something worth 
owning; like a BMW or a Mercedes. I 
have to admit we both liked it, It just 
seemed a little plain. We held off till 
August to look at a 2005. The dealer  
was able to get us everything we 
wanted; color, interior, nav system, 
dvd, air-bags, etc... We've put 5k on 
it so far. The ride is great, 
performance is good, I like it more 
every day. This car's a winner"

visit family and the mileage was almost 
28 mpg. With Canadian gas at roughly 4 
bucks a gallon this meant a lot. It is 
a good looking car that's fun to drive. 
It's got some head turning looks, too. 
My only complaint is that the rear

fact people writing the reviews either 
seem to love or hate this automobile.  
I find it to be a fantastic car.  More 
comfortable than my wife's E-class 
Mercedes, better features and far more 
reliable.  I really can't think of a 
thing to say negative.  Some others 
have complained about the MPG but, I 
find that a little silly.  This is a 
BIG auto with a 250 BHP engine.  What 
do you expect???  17+ MPG in town is 
rather good.  Great highway car, like 
riding a magic carpet."

Giant Price tag!!(Ford, get real)
MB ML's If I want to buy a Merc made 
in USA, Oh wait I got one it's called

are no better than any other American

owning the Volvo S80 T6 sadan.  I was 
tired of the expenses involved with the 
up keep and repairs of European cars, 
but I love their style.
I was happy to find what I was looking 
for in an ""American"" car.  Style, room, 
and most of all, the type of ride I 
expect from any other expensive vehicle.
The price is right, and the extended

chrysler,pacifica,2006,8 Year Owner, 07/01/2016,Owned for 8 years!!!,4,"It cracks me up that people are rating this car as if it were a 2016.  I have had this car for the past 8 years and can honestly say, it has been a reliable family car throughout.  Plenty of storage in the rear with seats down, which comes in handy for anyone needing extra interior space you wont find other than mini van.  The car has had low maintenance over the years other than oil changes and wiper blades.  My Pacifica has over 150K. and has been a good car.  One of the reasons I bought it when I did was for the safety ratings it had with side air bags etc.  Most cars then didn't even have side air bags.  The Pacifica was rated very highly for safety regarding side impact and I have had my kids ride in it all over creation and felt safe.  It has a deep console for storage along with sun glass holder and the arm rests along side the seats are great for long trips.  The Pacifica was the precursor to the hybrid SUV style cars and many manufacturers seemed to have copied much of its function and style over the years to a bit more modified versions.   I also like the placement of the things you need access to while driving... key on dash (easier to access) than on the column; manual shift option; lights and wipers and radio channel changer in steering wheel everything at your finger tips.

chrysler,pacifica,2006,Demetries, 08/25/2015,Best Car I've ever Purchased,4,"First off this is 2015 I just bought a 06 Pacifica that just hit 100k miles, the car is a dream, drives with no issue. I would expect a truck to ride rough have a lot of blind spots but it is a dream. one thing that definitely wins me is the space! I am 6""1 I have long legs and it always has been a issue with me driving or sitting in the back. the car is wonderful! I am ready to fill it up with some kids of my own for the 4 seats in the back.

only issue is have is there really isn't much storage space in arm or eye reach. i am use to storing stuff in different places that is reachable when i am driving. not good on gas but I am coming from having Cars for over 10 years into the truck world, but its good on gas on the highway.

chrysler,pacifica,2006,db, 09/23/2006,very satisfied,5,My wife and I really enjoy our Chrysler Pacifica. We traded in our Dodge Stratus to get our Pacifica and although they are different types of transportation we enjoyed our Stratus but the view that we get from our Pacifica is much better. We had great success with the Stratus and so far the Pacifica has by far exceeded our expectation. We have gotten between 25 and 28 miles per gallon depending on travel conditions. I would recommend this vehicle to any one. I would have liked to have goten the 3.8 that was offered in the 2005 but it wasn't offered in the 2006. I know the 3.5 offers more power but I don't tow anything and the 3.8 got better milage. I give the Pacifica 5 stars.
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Jimmy James, 04/21/2016,"Great family vehicle, awesome on highway.",4,"So I bought this from a family member in September 15. It's a great family vehicle and kids love it. Coming from a 2dr wrangler, this was a huge gain in interior space although huge decrease in coolness. It accelerates ok but transmission can be jittery in changing gears. fuel economy ok for an 06 car. Took it on a long road trip and performed exceptionally great. Have only changed the oil and replaced back rotors. It's a huge vehicle with plenty roominess, but sucks to park in the city parallel parking. Driving it feels like you're driving a sedan - sort of.  Seems like i got one of the good ones as many other reviews claim issues with transmission, motor mounts and rusting engine cradle. If i ever have to fix any of those issues, will just trade it in or sell it for cheap. Kids love it. It's a popular vehicle on used car market, so much so Chrysler brought it back as a new full fledged mini-van which looks like a giant chunky 200c , apparently they are killing off the Town and Country and the Dodge Caravan. I have the base version with the 3.5L engine which is ok. I can imagine the 07-08s with the 4.0L have much better acceleration and have a 6 speed transmission as opposed the 4 speed on mine, but those cost more and look like are less reliable. Would recommend if you buy it with under 100K miles and make sure to inspect motor mounts and engine cradle are not rusted out, otherwise you will be stuck with moneypit no one will buy.

Not your typical ""family truckster"". The design makes it not quite an SUV but not quite a mini van, incorporating the best of both while keeping a car like ride. I'm 6'4"" and there is more than enough space for me with comfortable power seats. The base model comes with many standard features that you might pay extra for on other vehicles . The $3000.00 cash back and extra $1000.00 lease loyalty combined with some help from Edmunds on the MSRP, made it a deal I couldn't refuse.  "
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Nicole Larrabee, 01/13/2007,"Love the look, the windows...not sure",3,I bought my car for the look I wont lie. It is a gorgeous car! I only wish that I would have noticed that the back window is very small. From the outside it looks deceiving. I personally have a very hard time seeing out of the back window while trying to back up. I feel that the car has too many blind spots and needs larger back windows. I did regret buying this car since I have two small babies and purchased it for its safety feature. Although like I said at the time I was so excited I overlooked the obvious. Also the tint is too dark for night driving. I feel the Town and Country would have been a better choice for me. But for looks the Pacifica wins.
chrysler,pacifica,2006,kerryg3, 03/07/2011,"Good car, good investment",4,"I bought my Pacifica in 2006 with 17,000 miles on it.
5 years later, now with 107,000 miles on it, I have had limited trouble.
The rocker arm went out, but the dealership covered it under the extended warranty.
I have noticed a huge usage in oil, so it's just a matter of checking it more often than normal.
I also had the motor mount replaced which I am being told is common in these cars.
Other than the few minor repairs, the car runs great, is very reliable and fun to drive!"

We've been driving this car since Feb. '08. Started with 32K & just rolled 97K early this week. We do a lot of traveling & it has always been the favorited reliable car to use. No real major issues. Do have occassional squeak in driver seat from bolster (Chrysler dealer would just adjust it & say it was 'corrected'.Aggravating).

I needed out of that truck, but as I drive it more and more every day it just gets beater. My wife loves it more than her Jetta because it is so much easier to get take the baby in. I have almost 3000 miles on it now, and it is performing perfectly, handles awesome, and the gas mileage while it could be better is better than that truck was. I am getting I guess split between highway, and city around 15-18. I love driving it. The stereo is ok, especially w/sirius"

The emissions can send you on a wild goose chase trying to figure out why it won’t pass smog.  The computer blames it on the gas cap, NO!  Throw away 💰 Oh yes. Let’s not forget, when you replace the key remote battery, it loses programming, and you pay to have it reprogrammed even when a dealership rep replaced the battery for you.

chrysler,pacifica,2006,Wewans, 08/31/2006,"Owned 25 new cars, this is the best one",5,"We love this car because it has all of the room of a minivan, but it is not a 'box'. It has a very distinct and appealing style. It looks like a 'classy' car, and when you look in the interior it is even more so. Gas mileage is not good, but that is a trade of because of the weight and safety of the vehicle. What good is it to save on gas if the vehicle is not heavy and safe. Is a family member's life worth a few hundred dollars in gas savings over the life of the vehicle? For its size and weight (4600 lbs} fuel economy is not bad. Compare apples to apples, oranges to oranges, and 4600 lbs vehicles to 4600 lb vehicles."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,sbe79, 06/08/2015,Decent Family Vehicle,3,"We bought this car last year with 100K on it.  We had a large amount of problems with it upon purchase that were 100% covered by the dealer (a Chrysler-certified Jeep dealership).  We bought it in July, it was finally cleared from the dealer's service bay in November.  That could be a record.  

The issue was an EVAP code that eventually led to having both fuel pumps replaced (the car has two).  The dealer began with the easy stuff (replacing valves and the gas cap).

The vehicle is an overall very good SUV.  It is spacious and the ride quality is on par with higher-end SUVs.  I'm not totally sold on the quality, but it's nearly solid since then.  I replaced the EGR valve this month."

My mileage says 137,000 miles, the ""new"" engine is only suppose to have around 37,000 miles on it. My front motor mount has had to be replaced, as well as other minor things, battery, starter, alternator.

However, that is where it stops. The car has absolutely no power. It is hard to merge onto the freeway, oh and when you accelerate to merge onto that freeway you will watch your money fly out the window because it sucks up so much gas. The reliability of the car is horrible. I have had the car stall on me several times while driving, and then brought it into the dealer for them to tell me that there is nothing wrong with the car.

chrysler,pacifica,2006,OyVay, 04/05/2009,Dead and Gone.,3,"Test driving many mid-sized SUVs and crossovers I fell in love with the Pacifica.I was pretty pleased with the vehicle: beautiful styling, quiet cabin, smooth ride, ample space - definitely a passenger conscious vehicle. Just before 50K the transmission went out. The amount of torque on the trans coupled with the weight of the Pacifica is Not a good combo. A part shot through transmission case causing a hole about the size of a quarter and all the fluid leaked out. The transmission began seizing one day while on the highway and nearly caused an accident. It was in the shop for nearly a month and fortunately I bought a 100k warranty on the thing. Afraid of further part issues, I traded out."

The DVD system and the integrated Sirius Satellite Radio are perfect for Mom, Dad and our two teenage daughters. You can plug your ipod right into the front of the stereo system via the A/V jacks too! It's a hefty, sturdy vehicle so the mileage isn't that great but it sure wasn't a deal-breaker.

Within a week serpentine belt was squeaking like a 20 year old car; took FIVE trips to dealer to fix (dealer explained, at last visit, that Chrysler service policy was to replace belt at least three times with Chrysler part; after that they could install GM part (!) that actually worked).  Dealer couldn't have cared less about problems.  Car is underpowered, with poorly spaced 4 speed auto gearing. Terrible climate control (no heat to legs in winter) and poor/slow defrosting.  Very disappointing overall, can't wait to get out of lease and into an Audi Q7."

Within the next day, I discovered that the car did pull to the right when I accelerated.  I took the vehicle back to the dealer and that began a long battle between myself and Chrysler.  The only answer I have gotten from them is that the pulling to the right is a characteristic of the car!  I was told to ""deal with it!""  I persued this problem throught Chrysler and was told that there was nothing that could be done.  I hate driving this car and I am in the process of trading it now."

Then stuff started happening like back to back. First it was the alternator, went out. Then it was the AC blower, then it ate my rotors and warped them, then it was the radiator etc etc. in one month, it been in the shop 3 times. Now the transmission is being rough, the car wobbles and rumbles at highway speeds. I have spent thousands of dollars on repairs for the car. If it weren’t for the reliability it would be a great car, but the fact that the shop has been its second home makes me give it a terrible review.

GPS just stopped.Tire pressure sensors break every time i go through a car wash so i have to hand wash only. I’ve had to fix a host of other things that i’d rather not recall just had it tow to the shop again -evap codes- possible why its shutting off.

I use it for work, so I put quite a few miles on it yearly.  Other than the blind spots, which you need to use the mirrors more than with other vehicles, this car has been great.  It is a smooth ride, it gets better gas mileage than was advertised (almost 19) it is quiet, turn-ratio is great, and the stereo is awesome.  It is also depended on when we are travelling with many people.  Went to the beach last year and fit six in comfortably.   I have 55,000 on it and plan to drive it at least two more years.  "

We love the quiet, smooth ride of the Pacifica, the elegant, comfortable interior, the many convenience features and the security of all-wheel drive.  Especially love the power rear liftgate.  The stereo is awesome. (And it doesn't hurt that it bears a more-than-passing resemblance to the R-Class Mercedes!)  "
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Anthony, 06/20/2006,Very good wagon,4,"I shoped around for a while. Drove the pacifica, and I was sold right away. I've sold vehicle, and was very happy about my selection. There has never been a better vehicle. Yes, there is a mercedes-benz feel. It is perfect fit for my family. We travel all the time. The wagon is a comfortable drive. "
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Scott S, 08/14/2006,"Lexus good looks, without the cost!",4,"After my wife and I were deciding between a Honda Pilot, Nissan Murano, or another Ford Explorer, we found the Pacifica at the Chicago Autoshow.  It doesn't have the best gas millage of the bunch, but it's way better than my 2000 Ford Explorer AWD. (13 mpg) I drive aggressively, but manage to get 19 mpg around town, and 23 mpg highway.  I told my wife I would only get it if we bought the Limited. I didn't like the flat black plastic lower panels, plain interior. The Limited really adds some class to the car, and after comparing it to my friends Lexus RX330, I think it's as good of styling and I paid a lot less! The Pacifica Limited FWD is a great looking car that is a pleasure to drive!"
chrysler,pacifica,2006,bigred06, 10/11/2006,Good attempt at something different,4,"This was a nice attempt to create somthing a little different. It's clear that this was a car produced after the merger. The interior materials and design are much better than anything Chrysler produced prior. The engine is adequate but would be alot better it the car didn't weigh so much. Gas mileage would be better as well. The experience making minivans shows in the inside with the attention to details. I like the fact that the seats fold flat without the console in the middle of the 2nd row getting in the way. Thus far mine has been solid. I am curious to see with all the electronics (nav system, tire pressure monitor, EVIC system etc.) will hold up over time. This was a solid effort."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,2006 Pacifica, 05/11/2007,2006 Pacifica,4,"Comfortable for 4 people, quiet and rides good. I have over 23,000 miles and have had no problems. It does have some bad blind spots that you have to get use to driving with. "
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Kevin, 10/28/2010,One of the best I've had,4,"Bought with 26k, now has 105k.  Replaced control arm, battery, struts.  Needs backrest motor replaced.  Great road car, SO comfortable, quiet and smooth. Runs/rides/drives great still.  Mileage as advertised.  Getting rid of it--with new service vehicle it sits most of the time.  Love the sound system, roominess, handling.  Better in snow than my wife's '06 outback.  It has been the nicest, most dependable car I've had."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Cristina, 11/03/2006,Great family car,4,I have a 2006 Pacifica and I love it.  It handles very well. The car is beautiful and I love the fact that its not a minivan or an SUV.  
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Very Pleased , 08/23/2006,WE LOVE IT! Smartest Buy Ever!,4,"Words can't describe how happy we are with our new Pacifica! My husband and I have a daughter and a little boy on the way, and we needed to get into a larger vehicle without putting out too much money. So we chose to lease the 5 passenger Pacifica. We love everything about it! The style, the way it drives (we're already planning a road trip), the comfort, EVERYTHING! Other reviewers commented on the fuel economy. The gas mileage is fine with me. We bought it Saturday and on Wednesday are only at a half a tank. For the size of the vehicle, the gas mileage is fine. Trust me! If you have a small family, and can't afford the high priced Honda Odessey yet, the Pacifica is the way to go!   "
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Linda Roman, 04/02/2006,I love my Pacifica,4,"This vehicle is fun to drive as well as looking great.  We travel often and this is the most comfortable vehicle I have owned in years. It handles like a sports car while having lots of room for people and cargo. When it comes time to get and new car, I will definitely get anothe one. "
chrysler,pacifica,2006,sbernal, 10/09/2015,Great... Sometimes,3,"I bought this car in July 2014 with exactly 100K miles, maybe a few over.  It is now October 2015 and the car has about 118K.  I'd say it's appearance is good and holds up decently in terms of newer vehicles.  People ask the year of the vehicle and are surprised it is a 2006.  The quality of the ride is excellent due to the attention Chrysler put on the suspension and the spaciousness of the cabin is enviable in the 6 cylinder class.  

That said, I think the engine is too small for the vehicle.  The acceleration is terribly sluggish and I always think I'm driving faster than I actually am.  I think I'm doing about 50 and look down to see I'm barely breaking 40.  I feel like a V6 engine should be adequate, but the way they did it in this car is NOT adequate.  The transmission is fully functional, but I kind of fear for it.  It can be slow to shift and occasionally give an ugly clunk upon both acceleration and deceleration.  I think 118K is far too early to be fearful of a transmission replacement.  

The AWD feature on most models is a huge positive.  After the torrential New England winter last year, this vehicle performed exceptionally well.  I drove the car for the first 10 months of our ownership.  However, my wife works in a location where the driveway in is nearly a vertical slope -- and the Pacifica made it up regardless of the quality of the weather.  She asked me to borrow it so many times, I eventually told her it belonged to her.  

In terms of instrumentation, I am disappointed.  Chrysler had always billed this vehicle as one with luxury styling.  The dash display is nearly identical to a Town & Country years older.  We had a friend who drove a 1998 T&C and the instrumentation was nearly identical.  Very basic, as far as I am concerned.  Speedometer, gas gauge, tachometer.  Where is the engine thermostat?  I've never owned a car that didn't have one.  How about a display showing the temperature outside?  Miles to empty display?  I realize there are different ""grades"" of this car, however this was is not the total base model.  I replaced a 2001 Volvo with this one also labeled ""luxury"", so I figured 5 years was enough for Chrysler to catch up.  Not so much.  It's sorely lacking and seems like the primary place Chrysler cheaped out on.  

Speaking of ""cheaped out on"", Chrysler installed a DVD player in my vehicle beneath the radio, but did not install a monitor.  So... you have exactly half a unit.  I have looked into installing a monitor multiple times.  The cost is astronomical.  If you have a third party do it, the cost can be in the thousands (on a now-9 year old American car... I'll pass).  If you attempt it yourself, you'd be better no less than ""Level:  Expert"".  The number of items you have to disassemble inside and the number and cost of the parts you have to buy is enough to destroy your will to live.  You need to be both mechanically and electrically inclined with precision -- this requires replacing the headliner with a brand new one and re-cutting the fabric to match all the things sticking out like it did from the factory.

chrysler,pacifica,2006,dave3cb1, 01/02/2013,Car cuts off,4,Love the car have had no problems with it. Past 3-4 months the car has been cutting off at intersections after getting ready to takeoff after stops. Does anybody know what the problem could be. Thanks
chrysler,pacifica,2006,samuelb, 09/01/2008,Hasn't Let Me Down Yet,4,"We purchased our Pacifica FWD Touring Edition in June of 2006. It now has almost 85,000 miles on it, mostly highway miles from my commute to work.  The Pacifica is a very comfortable and pleasant car to drive. The build quality has been pretty good and so far we've had no problems with it. One of the earlier comments about these cars being lousy in winter is incorrect. I've been through 3 winters now with my Pacifica and it gets through the snow almost as well as some 4 wheel drive vehicles do. Gas mileage hasn't been spectacular, but I think I could be doing a lot worse.  Overall, we're quite happy with our Pacifica."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,epv, 08/21/2009,Cute but trouble.,4,"We purchased ours used in anticipation of having out first child.  We love the roominess on the inside and the style, but that's about where it stops.  We've paid $800+ for two major brake repairs which were not covered under warranty. Even minor repairs and maintenance are ridiculously expensive - $85 for the two headlights that went out within 3 days of each other and $150 per tire.  There is also this awful rattling noise from the back that is very loud at highway speeds.  The door light cover falls off when I close the door too hard. The acceleration to highway speeds is slow.  The exhaust smells like it belongs on a 1970's car."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,John S., 06/01/2010,Another fine Chrysler vehicle,4,"Mine has about 56,000 miles, mostly highway usage and has never (never) had any service issues! It looks good, has decent seat comfort, adequate adult performance and good gas mileage (almost EXACTLY what the car is rated for).Still running on original tires with lots of tread left. What is not to like? I have now had 5 Chrysler cars. They have given me better service from the previous GM and Fords I had and also the horrible Saturn Vue I foolishly bought (ugh). I have considered buying a slightly used Mercedes (for the snob appeal), but I just can't abandon Chrysler given the great results I've had."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Love it so far, 08/16/2010,Love it so far,4,I bought my Pacifica new in 2006 and I love it.I hear all these bad reviews on it and it makes me think that if someone has something to complain about it they will post it and if they dont then they dont look to make it public.  I love my car and so far I am happy with it.  My brake light comes on at some point every time I drive it but I could care less. One of my arms on the rear hatch broke but I replaced it myself for $12.  It was easy.  It does seem like its starting to burn a quart of oil every 3k miles or so but thats no big deal to me.Its not normal but I do what I have to do.  I use synthetic oil and I also add Lucas oil just in case.  Overall I am happy so far.
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Vincent, 02/02/2006,New Pacifica,4,"I really like this car.  It is a pleasure to drive.  I have a fully loaded version and all the features are great.  You really feel safe in this car and in control of the road.  I get about 22 MPG highway and about 17 around town.  If you drive with the engine cold, it is very thirsty, but this resolves once the engine warms up. The rear DVD system is a lifesaver with my son, get it if you have kids.  The rear bucket seats are great and very comfortable.  The navigation system is well worth it, but mine did ""get lost"" twice, and I had to shut off the engine and restart the car to reset the navigation. Acceleration is moderate, but for transporting kids, it is just fine."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Vic, 02/28/2006,"Love it overall, hate the gas mileage",4,"Nice, comfortable ride, quiet interior, and highly recommend the leather seating. Only drawbacks are the gas mileage with AWD, we're getting 14-15 in town driving and never done better than 17-18 on Hwy.  That's a lot different than the 17city/22 hwy which is estimated."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,AKA, 03/28/2006,Cool Pacifica 2006,4,"This has been couple of weeks for my new 2006 Pacifica Touring. 1) Looks good both in and out 2) Cloth interior seats are comfy 3) Controls are easy 4) Some features are like luxury car 5) Second row seat center console is no value. 6) Engine is very noisy and sluggish 7) Something must be done for the driver side blind spot 8) The controls on the steering are not visible during the night i.e., no background light."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Happy Owner, 08/21/2006,Great Vehicle,4,"I was looking for a traditional SUV but fell in love with the Pacifica.  It seats 5-6 comfortably, rides smoothly, and has a very distinctive look.  I did a test drive of the new 2007 Hyundai Santa Fe (which was nice) but decided the Pacifica had a more luxurious and quiet ride.  "
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Pacifica 4 dr tour, 07/30/2005,Bush's Review of the 2005 Pacifica,4,"This vehicle is stable on the road and is gives a very comfortable ride.  The interior is very appealing;  the dash appears to wrap around the front which is especially nicely designed.  The driver's seat is quite comfortable for me, and I am a short person.  I especially like the extra lumbar support.  The vehicle recently took four children in booster seats and car seats on a short outling; the ride was quite comfortable for the two adults.  Cargo space is limited when using four car seats for children, but I do not haul more than two children on most occasions.  The children and I like the extra vents that help to circulate heat and air conditioning.  "
chrysler,pacifica,2006,HAL POTE, 11/03/2005,A winner in most every way,4,"A real joy to drive, especially in the mountains. The all-wheel drive is sweet and makes cornering a breezing at speed.  A bit slow after the one-two shift unless under full throttle.  Ample room and interior seating is fully adjustable and folds easily. Cargo space is cavernous and we love it. Expect only about 17-18 mpg in denver commuting or 75mph interstate driving."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Jimmy, 11/22/2005,...about my new Pacifica,4,"The last time I wrote one of these it was in praise of my 2000 Volkswagen Jetta GLS 1.8t.  Little did I know what a jinx I caused myself.  Okay, the Pacifica is a nice car.  One I wouldn't have ever considered but I hate minivans and with a new addition to the family, I had to get a bigger car.   So far, crossing my fingers, I love everything about my Pacifica.  I love the ride, handling, stereo, the navigation is awesome (though about 4 years behind the times in my part of the country), and the DVD in the back is great for the kiddies.  I don't know what else to say other than, buy one!  Hopefully, 4-5 years down the road I will still be singing its praise."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Burtis, 11/22/2005,Don't Want To Get Out Of It!,5,"totally comfortable vehicle.  plenty of interior room, great horsepower, stereo system is topshelf, all interior features easily accessible.  Great vehicle to drive on both short and long trips."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,John Linton, 01/27/2006,2006 Chrysler Pacifica,5,"This vehicle is pure fun and joy to drive and ride in!  It is everything and more that I had expected when I ordered it.  It has style, comfort, pep, fuel economy and it turns heads.  The only trip back to the dealership[ has been for an oil change.  No surprises with this car.  Overall finish and detail is as near perfect as anything I've seen so far. I'm delighted with it."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Sue Dukatnik, 06/23/2006,Susie's Pacifica,4,"I just bought my pacifica and I love it. It has plenty of room with seats up or down, handles well and it is just pretty.  I have always had a jeep but decided to try the pacifica, I am very happy with it.  The dealership i bought my car at is great, the salesmen were very helpful and i have dealt with them before. I will again."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Dave Tacker, 07/31/2006,After first year only so-so,2,"After the first year, I am not so satisfied.  Came with defective ball joints (brake = thunk!), and a rattle that the dealer had to jimmy-rig to fix.  Does drive OK, but feels sluggish. Suppose it handles like any other SUV. Blind spots are annoying.  Paint on the plastic parts is really of low quality and tiny dings cause missing paint that peels more and more. Horrible gas mileage for a V6 (12-14 MPG in city). No space for any cargo with 3rd seat up. Very disappointing, will probably sell before warranty is up. "
chrysler,pacifica,2006,CRITREALTY, 08/26/2006,Pacifica,4,Great family travel vehicle. Especially great childrens vehicle with DVD player installed.

chrysler,pacifica,2006,Prime, 09/04/2006,Great wagon,3,Got this about a week ago.  Drove it about 1000 miles in the last week.  Comfortable and quiet.  Nav system a dream for my wife who can't read a map.  Problem with tire pressure system errors. Dealer to look at tomorrow.  Otherwise no problems.
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Liz, 04/04/2008,Troubled,2,"Bought the Pacifica when it was just a year old. 36,000 mi and already have ABS light on and some kind of leak from evaporator tank to gas tank. The only way to find this problem was through dealership because dashboard computer system ""so sophisticated"" my trustworthy mechanic wouldn't touch it. Also tends to speed up when I brake, hard choppy braking, sometimes feel like I'm driving a Suburban with a trailer and boat attached. I live in a hot climate and AC does not cool enough. Hear a clicking in the steering wheel column. Very uncomfortable getting people into third row seats. No storage when all seats taken. I'm a single mom with two children and this car is worrying me."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,theresa, 07/17/2006,Best Vehicle Purchase,4,Love this vehicle.  Comfortable riding and great interior space.  My husband is over 6 ft and he has no trouble at all getting in and out of this car.  Such a nice riding car.  Took it to TN last week and it was just wonderful.
chrysler,pacifica,2006,David P, 08/10/2006,Family car for older kids,4,We have had the car for a week and used it for local and long distance travel.  It is quite comfortable and the middle row console separates my kids (a great feature).  Car like ride with high seating position trumps SUV's.  Vehicle has a  lower center of gravity than a minivan.  Mercedes like suspension.  This car exceeds the R Class for 25G less.  
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Frank, 09/02/2007,Nothing But Problems,2,"My 2006 Pacifica has been nothing but problems.  Warped rotors, transmission issues, high idle on three occassions, exterior windshield gasket falling off, body molding/trim on drivers side of vehicle pulling away from frame of car...and several other issues.  The car has only 18,000 miles on it, but it seems that it has spent more time in the dealers garage than it has in my own.  I've never had a vehicle with so many issues, and I've had 19 vehicles in 25 years.  The dealer has been cooperative and accomodating on most issues, but we've had so many problems, the service manager knows us so well that no appointment is necessary.  We just bring it in.  Has been a very bad experience."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,lemonsbeware, 05/04/2011,POOR WORKMANSHIP AT IT'S BEST,1,"I am about to trade my '06 Pacifica in. Since I bought it: left front axle broke as I was leaving a parking space, emissions leak x 2, ABS malfunctions, lose power steering after driving in the rain, car shuts off immediately after sharp left turns, replaced struts. Now: front and rear motor bearings must be replaced, entire oil pan needs to be replaced, belt tensioner needs to be replaced, AND THIS DOESNT COVER THE OTHER EXHISTING PROBLEMS. 

I am a single mom of two. I do not drive like a lunatic and I use it to run local errands; take me and the kids to and from school and work. This car has cost me so much money it makes me want to cry. "
chrysler,pacifica,2006,dmrtx, 04/28/2008,The Good the bad and the ugly!!!!!!,3,"I really love driving this car, it has lots of room and has the feel of a luxury car. (the good)  I have had issues with the passenger airbag light coming.  It has been 4 times for this and they say they have reprogrammed the system.  The last time it was in the sales manager stated that you shouldn't lay anything on the seat if no one was sitting in it. That makes no sense! (the bad)  Have 25K miles, have been having issues when starting to drive the wheels lock up and the only thing that seems to fix it is to back up about 10 ft and then drive forward.  Now it's making a popping noise when you start to drive forward.  The dealer checked the parking brake and found nothing. (the ugly)"
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Last Chrysler for me, 08/05/2008,"Not happy Chrysler owner, last 1 4 ME",3,"Bought this car used in Jan 08, not too happy. Had to replace rocker arms last week, big money, no warranty even though only 50K miles. Some ABS or maybe rotor problem, don't even want to know the price for these repairs. Problems with cruise control, has mind of own, shifts up or down, won't resume speed if hit brakes. There is a loud clicking noise when turning slowly, the transmission shifts for no reason at times. This is the noisiest car I've ever owned, there so many squeaks, clicks and rattles inside the passenger compartment that it is difficult to have a peaceful ride. Sunroof clicks if open or racked, the springs on the passenger seat, trim rattles on doors/dashboard, last 1 for me"
chrysler,pacifica,2006,John Kennedy, 11/15/2010,I'm enjoying the ride so far!,4,"I have had this FWD Basic Model for just a couple of months and have enjoyed a really nice ride so far. Our other car is a 2007 RX350 and while this vehicle does have the same features and comfort, it's pretty close and and has more room inside. I enjoy driving it. My first tank of gas gave me 17.9 miles per gallon. As good as our other car that is 500 lbs lighter with a 3.5 L engine."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Brandi, 07/12/2006,Love My Pacifica,4,"My husband and I are looking to start a family soon but since we both owned small, two-door cars, we knew it was time to upgrade to a more family- appropriate vehicle.  The Pacific is a perfect fit for us!  It is the most comfortable ride I've ever had in a vehicle, and the price was right for all of the ""bells and whistles"" when you consider the power seats/locks, 2nd and 3rd row seats that fold for storage, etc.  There are just too many great things about the Pacifica to list here!"
chrysler,pacifica,2006,kathleen collins, 08/18/2005,outstanding,5,"this vehicle has exceeded expectations. the ride is great, handling superior and the safety ratings speak for themselves. I have 30,000 miles on the vehicle with no major problems. all I have done is change the oil and rotate the tires.The one real surprise was how helpful the GPS system is. I will not buy another vehicle without it. The day I purchased the vehicle I test drove the honda pilot, toyota highlander and the pacifica. The pilot was third, the highlander was a very close second, but the pacifica was much more vehicle for what I paid. The highlander and the pacifica came in close in price, but the pacifica had many more features (options) and a better warranty. "

So far I've had to replace both cv joints at under 42,000mi, 2 coil packs, front disc brakes, transmission leak at 40,000. The gas mileage stinks, and the front brakes are having problems breaking again. This would not have happened with a Japanese vehicle. You can bet that this is my FIRST AND LAST Dodge/Chrysler vehicle I ever buy and would only recommend it to our enemies. "
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Mike B., 07/07/2008,"So Far, So Good",4,"I had driven a Pacifica Touring AWD from SW PA to Dickson, Tn on several occasions and took a few different routes to see how she ran. I had my favorite time through the mountains of WV.  It has an excellent ride shared with its Benz siblings, is quiet, and has beautiful interior. I have a Signature Series with two tone gray/black leather and aluminum trim where the woodgrain usually is.  Gas mileage is OK for a 4500 pound machine, but the 19 inch tire option will kill you, $250.00 per tire!  Using the Auto Stick it is peppy, but if you're not used to a revving engine to make power you may find it sluggish.  It serves my family of 4 plus the neighbors kids well!!!  Overall a great product!"
chrysler,pacifica,2006,EBM, 08/04/2008,Great! Not a problem,5,"Best car.  Had it almost three years and not one problem (how often does that happen).  Drives great, fun to drive, mileage good for the weight and size (17 city, 23+ highway), plenty of room, quiet, fun to drive (did I already say that?).  Took it on three long trips and was a breeze.  Felt very secure, true to the road, couldn't ask for a better car.  Lease is up and I don't want to give it up.  Might have to buy another one."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Good Vehicle, 08/05/2008,Pacifica's Rock,3,While this is not the best car it is a good car. For a 'big' vehicle it transmits a fair amount of the road. There is a tendency to oversteer in sharp turns but it does not lean.  The ABS feels 'funny' when doing a normal stop. There is an awful harmonic when the rear windows are lowered partially with speed over 40 mph. It is roomy for carrying but lacks rear leg room and the 3d row is just for kids.  
chrysler,pacifica,2006,No, 09/08/2008,Best Car I ever had,4,This is a great car. I was in a very serious accident and needed a car that would feel and be safe for me and my daughter. It is. The only issue is gas mileage and some poor rear visibility. Best Car I ever owned. love It
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Lee, 10/28/2008,Hate to see it go,4,"So far this has been an absolutely fabulous driving and riding vehicle. Wife doesn't ask to stop every two hours to stretch and walk out the kinks.  Gas mileage is not bad (22.7) on trips as long as you don't use ethanol.  In 34000 miles the only problem is with an electronic sender that tells the torque converter to lock.  Warranty covered. Hate to see them go, may drive this one into the ground."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Shawn, 12/18/2008,First and last,4,"My ABS light kept coming on and I found out that my tire sensors were malfunctioning. That was $600 worth of heartache. The breaking system has always been loud and annoying and there are clicks and clacks in the axles. By the way, never drive over 40mph and lower the back windows. I haven't studied enough physics to figure that one out yet. Neither has Chryslers engineers. There is also a bad blind spot in the drivers rearview. Also, my passenger side low beam light has blown 3 times in the last 6 months. They only cost $20 a pop. Oh well."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Leon, 12/30/2008,Love or Hate?,4,"My wife and I fell in love with the looks inside and out on our 15th anniversary and drove it off the lot. We have noticed as others have (low fuel economy, bellowing noise with the back windows down, some obstructed view in the rear, but most of all look out at 45000 miles. Rocker arm repair will hit and with a short warranty period you are looking at $1300+ in repair costs. After some complaining about the pre-mature defect Chrylser helped out with the repair bill. Koodos for that. Now that we are going on to 50k we are feeling some trans. shifting issues, but could it be the lack of a warranty jacking with my mind. Over all to this point I like the car."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,berdan, 01/21/2009,Love my Pacifica,4,"I have four children who are older, I came from many minivans.  We couldn't give up the space because sometimes the kids are with me for traveling. Also I like having space for when I buy furniture. I like a car that I feel safe in. This car offers all that. It drives like a dream. The seats are not so comfortable! A road trip to Florida proved that they are not meant for comfort."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,SereneMoments4U, 01/22/2009,Ready to trade,3,"I fell in love with the stylish look of the vehicle and the roomy interior. After a brief test drive, I purchased the Pacifica. Now, after several months of driving my Pacifica, I'm ready to trade. There is a terrible blind spot on the driver's side, and backing up, unless you have the backing assistance, is a nightmare. You simply cannot see out the back due to the design of the car. There is more interior noise than I anticipated. The Pacifica is pretty to look at, but I'm anxious to trade this one off."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,SILVERMOON103, 05/10/2009,LOVE IT,4,"This is the first SUV/Crossover owed and I LOVE IT! I have the Touring edition with the navigation/dvd/6disk changer and wouldnt give up anything! At first learning to back up in it was a challenge as there is a slight blind spot on the drivers side but after some getting used to, hardly noticable anymore. Replacing tires is expensive but if that is all i have to replace then i am very content to pay whatever needs to be paid to get them taken care of.  The seats are extra comfortable especially with lumbar support and easy to drive on long trips. The performance is great and handling is easy! "
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Sean, 05/14/2009,"So far, so good",3,"Ours is 3 years and 45k miles old and has done well so far.  No serious reliability problems to date.   Yes, it's heavy, meaning: fairly slow and thirsty.  It was bought with safety in mind, so the weight is part of the package.  Good in the snow, good on highways, nice interior, nice exterior and the 6 seats come in useful.   My only reservations come from reading some of the other comments here about reliability, but this one has behaved and has a 100k extended warranty from a non Chrysler company.    "
chrysler,pacifica,2006,LavandaDolce, 01/12/2008,I'm Unhappy,3,"Forget this vehicle if you live in snow. My Pacifica Touring has 24,000 highway miles. The ABS System is poor. Grinding stops on light wet roads. 2 occasions in which vehicle ""sped up"" on it's own. Poor visibility when looking to back out of a parking space. Sorry that I fell in love with the interior as the car itself is very scary to drive. It's going to dealership to find out what the problem is with the ABS system. Handles absolutely poorly in snow and/or wet roads. Fact is, I refuse to drive my car until dealer proves whatever is wrong is fixed. "
chrysler,pacifica,2006,John, 06/11/2009,2nd one and I love it,4,"We purchased a 2005 new off the lot and it has 80K and looks like its brand new, only had to put tires and oil changes, got 75K on the brakes.  love it so much that I just found a 2006 with 21K, like a brand new one.  I know Chrysler got a bad wrap, but I have had a concorde, two intrepids and a LHS, all of them have been low maintianance and drove well.  If you can find one with lowe miles, they are going cheap and are great hwy cars.  Only draw back is that they are a 4 person not 6 for comfort.  "
chrysler,pacifica,2006,SGT Penny, 01/26/2008,Great Car,4,"I bought this car in Dec. 2006 as of today I have 48000 miles on it. I got this car for my wife and are 2 babies, they love it. The dvd player is great on long trips. I have had no problems with this car. One of the best on the road. To young for the mini van, already have a Yukon XL, this is much better. All the people whinning about mpg, they aren't driving it right. I get anywhere between 19.2 to 24.7. It has the get up ad go if you use the auto stick, thats what it is for. Ever car has blind spots, stop being lazy and mover your head around."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,eli, 09/18/2009,love it,4,"No problems since i've bought it used in 07, used it in many trips - great comfort. Guess got lucky as reliability concern and so are our friends who own one. love it love it love it."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Jeff, 10/29/2009,Reliable Ride,4,"I first leased the vehicle in '06 and at the end of the agreement Chrysler gave a great discount and bought the car. I have 50k miles on it, still original tires. I have replaced both headlights, and the front brakes and the oil regularly it's been a tank. The highway ride is great, they improved the engine in later years and then just gave up. You'll see them on the road for a long time to come."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,bobby henderson, 11/04/2009,leased it then bought it,4,"I originally leased it. Silver W Black leather, 6 seats 3 ranges of very cold a/c. lots of off the line punch, smoke the front wheels if you push it hard. decent milage in the city about 17-18 hwy 26-28mpg @ 70mph cruise on.Only problem when new abs light came on panick stop produced 4 wheel lock up. Repared under warrenty. Oh almost forgot motor mounts went bad replaced w 4.0 ltr eng.looks great lots of hybred potential here. big mistake with ugly replacement. great alternative to not drive minivan, i,ve had 4.pacifica was a big mistake to kill instead to improve on a great cuv and lots of choices. sunroof,electric rear dr,6 bucket seats,nice stereo, 4wd,back up sensors police invisible..."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,piperfarm, 12/15/2009,The Money Pit,3,"I had this car for 4 months and had to replace all the rocker arms in the motor and a pulley that was cracked.  Cost me $1600.  Not a happy camper. All of this at 38,000 miles.  Road noise is not good.  I hear clicking and clacking up in the front of the car. I just turn the radio up to drown it out.  I like the way the car looks inside and out.  I like the way it drives.  The motor is a piece of crap -  obviously.  Especially after reading other review of people sinking lots of money to repair the rocker arms too.  What is the deal Chrysler?    I have gotten used to the blind spots in the back...it took a while, but I rely on my side mirrors a lot. "
chrysler,pacifica,2006,duneriders, 01/16/2010,Poor Gas Mileage,3,"This car is roomy inside for a family of 4. I could only fit 2 carseats in the back seat, so if you have more than 2 children, I wouldn't suggest buying. It has a lot of space in the rear cargo area, it is enough to fit, stroller, play yard, and luggage and still have room to spare. It didn't get the 17 in town and 23 on freeway that I expected, I only got 14 in town and 20 on freeway, and I am not a fast speedy driver."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Liz, 01/19/2010,LOVED OUR PACIFICA,4,We've had our car for 38 months. Have had nothing go wrong with it.  Our lease is over next month and we wanted to buy a new one but found out they are no longer being made. 
chrysler,pacifica,2006,pacifica, 03/21/2010,Stuck driver's seat,2,"My driver seat is stuck in the forward mode, it will not go back, so when I drive it I need to struggle to get in. When I have to get out is a nightmare! I have almost pulled my shoulder out of its socket trying to pull myself out of the car. I pray I don't get in a accident because the paramedics won't be able to get me out of the car. My concern is when this happens is there an emergency release button that can be pressed? Please let me know."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,patriot, 03/18/2010,Uncomfortable,2,"We bought the car to haul the family around.  However, it is so uncomfortable that we end up taking two vehicles every where.  I would never recommend this vehicle to anybody with a family bigger than 4.  Also get poor fuel mileage.  Not super reliable either"
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Ali Rodriguez, 03/20/2010,I love this car,4,I have this car since 09. i never had any problem with it. The only thing is that i m starting to listen a strange noise when i switch it from park to drive.. 
chrysler,pacifica,2006,monkey5, 05/04/2010,Great car,4,I have had this car from the beginning and I love it! I always get complimented by passengers. There are so many nice features- the heated seats in front and back and I can comfortably haul two adults in the third row as well. The auto liftgate is a huge help when getting groceries and the car has a really smooth ride. The entertainment options are awesome and keep the kids very happy. Great also because we can haul them and their friends without a huge road hog vehicle. Have not had any technical issues other than an electrical coil that was under warranty. Would recommend this to anyone. 
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Kemong, 05/18/2010,2006 pacifica,4,"Bought used at repo auction. Very pleased with driving and handling.  Lots of room for the family.  This car is fat and requires attention getting in and out of parking spaces.  No problems after 7K miles of city and highway driving.  Only expense so far is oil, tires and alignment.  Brakes are next. No engine issues."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,malviv, 08/16/2010,Impressive Looks Poor Engine,3,This vehicle has a history of engine oil consumption.  I would strongly encourage any prospective buyer to completely research this before making a purchase.  A nice car with a bad engine doesn't make for a good investment.
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Walt, 02/24/2008,Great car,5,"Rides and drives great, very comfortable on trips, had no problems with it, better than an SUV in the snow. Grandkids love the DVD and heated seats in the back. We are very satisfied with this vehicle so far. Consumer Reports shows poor reliabilty for 04 & 05 models, but great tests in 06, I think they have the bugs worked out."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Frank, 08/29/2005,2006 Review,4,Thought I would offer my comments on a 2006 Pacifica as there is so little information on them.  I had ordered mine on the first day they accepted Fleet orders and took delivery five days ago.  Already have almost 600 miles on it.  The biggest complaint I had heard related to fuel economy.  So far I have averaged about 20.6 MPG.  It has been a mixture of city but mostly highway driving.  It is a joy to drive and my kids were wild about the way it looks.  .  
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Kenneth Ruehl, 08/30/2005,Pacifica on the 101,5,"Wow, what a great Car.  It is quiet, gets looks whever you go.  We were in Newport beach over the Weekend and this car fit right in.  Ride is remarkable and the comfort features are more than adequate.  With this car everybody is happy. Kids can recline the seats or move the seats back for more leg room, and the windows roll all the way down in the back. Our Pacifica is loaded with everything except Navigation. Who needs NAV. I am a guy I know where I am going. Nothing is better than driving a car like this and knowing you have a car with a five star crash rating.  Easy to get in and get out of.  fits everybody comfortably.  Fit and Finish is way above standard.  We Love our Pacifica!"
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Alicia Ryker, 10/19/2005,A wonder decision made. . . . .,4,"I traded a 2005 Chrylser 300 Touring in on my Pacifica, I bought my 300 3 weeks after they hit the showroom floor, while it was definitely an eye catcher in the looks department, it just wasnt my dream car, 2 weeks after I bought my 300 I had the opportunity to drive a Pacifica, I was hooked and wanted one, my husband told me that I had to drive my 300 for a year, (I bought the rear wheel drive model)I endured a modest Pacific Northwest winter, where I discover that the 300 wasn't worth much in the snow, and decided that I was going to get a Pacifica.  I did and as winter approaches, I eagerly anticipate driving my all-wheel drive model, it is comfortable and beautiful as well as practical."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Irving, 10/31/2005,Great Purchase,4,"My wife and I arew so thrilled with our new Pacifica...I owned a Nissan Maxima that carried the HID headlights and got hit (stolen) around 3 times.  This last time I ended up having to rent a Pacifica...The minute I drove it off the rental car, I fell in love with it.  The style, speed and comfort are superb...We love the features of the 26U packages and we love our 17 chrome clad wheels...  We saved around $2600 by using the Edmunds.com invoice price list...this combined with the right timing can safe you hundreds and gives you less time to spend at the dealership."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Ginger, 03/09/2006,Love my Pacifica,4,This is a great combination for those of you looking for the features of a SUV with the room of a mini van.
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Lourdes Lazy, 03/13/2006,driving in comfort,4,I find the Pacifica a fun and comfortable to drive. The leather seats are very nice.
chrysler,pacifica,2006,James, 03/13/2006,You just would not believe it!,5,"I have owned BMWs and other luxury cars, but for the money you just cant beat this one!  It is just a pure delight to drive.  It is quite and smooth and wind noise is virtual non existent. Road noise is about the same as a 745i but just a tad bit louder. The seats are just right, not to firm or soft; they just seem to hug and hold you.  Like most people are saying in here, the leg room is outstanding!  As for the wife, she loves the drive height as she can see over the small cars and loves the way it handles. Parking is no problem here!  We look forward to a long relationship with this one."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,idoc, 04/11/2006,Good but need a few improvements,3,"Good car all around.  Does not seem as large when driven.  Nice ride and very spacious.  The navigation screen is poorly placed.  Wife almost got into an accident when trying to adjust it. Very poor fuel economy.  Much of this car resembles a down scaled version of the MB R class.  The nice features in the MB is not in the Pacifica (stability control and large moon-roof), that I wished is availible in the Pacifica."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,MsBhaven1, 04/20/2006,Happy Birthday To Me--My New Pacifica,4,"I love this car.  I have had it for 1 week and have done both city driving and highway driving and it handles beautifully and rides so smoothly I feel like I'm on a magic carpet ride.  The features on this car are well laid out.  At first I was put off by the location of the remote stereo/audio controls (they are located behind the steering wheel--but after using them I realized that it makes most sense to put them there since your fingers are natually wrapped around the wheel.  The bass with the Infinity Intermezzo surround sound is kicking. And the 19"" wheels hug the road like a sports car.  I feel like a 16 year old again--I go out and just sit in this car to get away from it all."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,SOUTH FLA FAMILY, 05/18/2006,Perfect fit,4,"Perfect fit for us enough room for the kids and traveling seats are very comfortable, classy enough for going out on the town, very comfortable to drive, drives better then most entry level luxury cars and  safety features are a plus , for the price loaded with leather,dvd, power lift gate sun roof etc, and extra bells and whistles you cant beat it for value of under 27k with chrysler factory incentives. compared it to the Odyssey, quest, sedona and sienna it was a much better value and a lot more stylish and safer feeling. had it for a month now and altough the gas tank is a bit thirsty , we LOVE IT!1     "
chrysler,pacifica,2006,buy it, 07/04/2006,every thing we need,3,getting in and out of the front seats can give you a knot on your head. some what difficult to get in and out of the third  row seat.a great highway family get a way car very little wind noise and a firm feel on the road.and it makes us feel we are wraped in a car that was made to protect your family!!!!!!!!!
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Carlos, 07/08/2006,Pretty fun car,4,This is a very nice family car but is also very sporty.....nice car
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Gus Rodriguez, 08/02/2006,Looks great,5,"Comfortable while driving,stable in rainy condition, many features not found in most cars, normal pick-up power"
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Joseph Critchley, 08/05/2006,Joe's review,4,"Comfortable to drive, easily adapted from six passengers to utility use. Roomy yet does not feel large when driving or parking."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,pbramel, 08/23/2005,pacifica,4,0ne of the best cars I have ever owned.       I am 69 yrs. old. The only problem for me is that there are too many dials on the console. 
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Jean Evridge, 09/06/2005,Great crossover Vehicle for the money,4,"Great service, love the NAV, works so well in any state, interior very roomy and appealing, great for road trips, sound system is awesome, DVD for trips is nice, love the heated seats - all are heated, many features only found in much more expensive cars, rented one last year, made a believer out of me! Gas is not the best, but okay, what do you expect in a large vehicle??? Love mine! "
chrysler,pacifica,2006,KATHI, 11/03/2005,2004 Pacifica,3,"I love the interior and the looks of the Chrsyler Pacifica.  BUT, I have had nothing but problems with the vehicle, the transmission (electrical).  The dealership has been great, but until it holds a code, nothing can be surely fixed. I will not buy another Pacifica, EVER.  Terrible luck with vehicle. "
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Marcia, 01/15/2006,Very happy,4,I love this car! Sitting higher on the road and the interior head room makes extended drives very comfortable for all passengers and the driver. The versatility of seat adjustments has made hauling cargo very convenient when needed. 
chrysler,pacifica,2006,tomkat, 01/17/2006,love it,4,"Have driven this vehicle about 5,000 miles so far and couldn't be more pleased.  Comfortable ride, excellent handling and good milage for size and weight of the vehicle (23 mpg average so far)."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Wesley R, 02/20/2006,It's about time!,5,I woke up this morning and had that proud feeling that I did something for my family. Just acouple days ago I got one of the most beautiful vehicles I have ever had so happy with its comforts and style. I feel so safe on the road Its the absalute smoothest vehicle that we tried family of 5.
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Jenn, 02/21/2006,This is one hot vehicle,4,"I leased a Walter P. Signature Series Pacifica a couple of weeks ago. I took it home to show my husband over the weekend, and by Monday morning we owned the vehicle.  We got the sunset bronze colored exterior, with two toned leather heated seats (which my husband said he would never own, but now absolutely loves them). I love having the Navigation system and the rear DVD player for our long trips we take every year.  I should say that it will be hard to give this vehicle up at the end of the lease."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Julie, 03/19/2006,LOVE IT!,4,"I love this car!!  Had a Sienna mini- van before, and while it was comfortable, convenient, and practical, just didn't have the style that I was looking for.  The Pacifica has all that and more!  I love the way this car looks and drives.  Love the interior - sporty and roomy.  The one major negative is the gas mileage.  It is not good at all around town.  I get in and can see the gauge go down after each small trip around town.  Having said that, I would still buy another because I just love this car!!"
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Saxman, 04/27/2006,A pleasant surprise !!!,4,"We were told this vehicle had bad blind spots, but after a test drive (and using the side view mirrors as they were intended) we found no blind spots. It's fun to drive and is very comfortable on long trips. The V6 accelerates nicely and merges into highway traffic easily. The interior is spacious and the instrmnt & contrl panels are well designed. We needed a vehicle with alot of leg room and after trying the Japanese suvs the Jeep Commander and some mini vans the Pacifica beat them all! Ours has alot of options but if I could choose only  one it would be the rear-park-assist it's worth it. My wife and I love this vehcl and recommend test driving it and forming your own opinion. A Great Ride!!"
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Redge, 05/12/2006,2005 Pacifica,4,"Excellent build quality, solid feel when driving, low interior noise.  I love the car.  I also tow a 2,000 lb camp trailer with it in the mountains and as a tow car it does very well and far better than any pickup truck.  Love to drive this car!"
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Reta, 05/16/2006,Love it love it love it,5,The first day I picked my Pacifica up I had to take a trip 5 hours one way. It was wonderful. My three year old daughter fell alseep instantly on the test drive as well and nothing was working to get her to go to sleep. That won me over.
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Patti, 05/16/2006,I LOVE this car!!,4,"I went from driving a 4wd Ford Expedition to my Pacifica, without looking back. This vehicle is comfortable and easy to drive. It is easily one of the ""prettiest"" interiors I have seen. I have driven the Chrysler 300, and actually prefer the Pacifica. The heated seats are certainly worth having, and I love the second row captain seats. While it wouldn't have suited driving around 8 middle schoolers (I was the Mom elected to drive everywhere....) it is perfect for four adults! I am very happy with my car!"
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Joe Haraida, 05/28/2006,A real surprise ...,4,It was time to trade in our 2000 Grand Caravan. My wife and I were looking for Minivan or SUV that would be roomy enough for our family and an occasional guest or two. While web surfing we saw the Pacifica and it caught both of our eyes. We went to a dealer for a test drive and were hooked! Bought it that day! It had the room we needed and the style and comfort we wanted! 
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Dick G, 08/01/2006,Great Tourer,4,"The Pacifica is all you need if you enjoy riding and touring the highway. I even use it as my commuter and not only does it provide reasonable fuel economy at 21 mpg, I also feel secure and safe in the tight body... without all the heavyness of a truck based SUV (Traded a Durango). Seats are great, low noise in cabin and a great view except for backing up.. but getting used to that as well!"
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Tom, 09/01/2006,Happy so far,4,Comfort and looks sold me.  Has more room for 6 passengers than my minivan.  Rides very nice and above average pick-up.  Cargo area with 6 passengers is small but overall it is vesatile.
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Julie, 01/27/2007,help,3,I have had my 2006 pacifica for over a yr. now everything is great about it other than the gas mileage and the main thing is the blind spots. It really doesn't matter how well a vehicle performs or how pretty it is if you cannot see out of it now does it?I love the handling of it and the inside is roomy. It will turn on a dime but you better look a lot before you turn
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Cole, 03/02/2007,Decent Car. Quit Nitpicking.,4,"Not the most fuel efficient car (18/25) it certainly is a car that depends on driving style to get the most out of the mileage. Decent power, went through the rockies without problem. Build quality is much better than its non-Daimler predecessors. Is great for our 2 kids. Reverse facing car seats in the 2nd row do not affect the front seat passengers (didn't get that from our old Windstar) Great stereo (love the mp3 player), nice and comfortable for long trips. Can't beat it for the price."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Bret, 05/12/2007,Everyone should have one!,4,"I had originally thought the Pacifica was lacking in aesthetics, but now I feel completely different. It shares its sleek design with the similar Mercedes crossover model. We'll call it unique. Performance is A++. The 3.5ltr engine pumps out 250hp and is very capable of breaking the tires loose from the asphalt. Fuel economy is average, but certainly acceptable for a full-size vehicle. Interior comfort is a huge plus for those in the front as well as back seating areas."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Connie Hawkins, 07/23/2007,I really love my car,4,"We had a Pacifica as a rental car a couple of times, I liked them so much I bought one......I love the way it handles (was awasome in the snow)it zips in and out of traffic like a small car but has lots of room like a big car. Has a lot of get up and go. I love that it feels so posh inside and is so very quite it relly is like being in Benz.  I have a bad back so one of the things is, it is easy to load up (it is a great level) and the seats are fanny level, I don't have to climb up or drop down. I have had it almost a year and have no problems.    "
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Raulo, 07/06/2007,Dissapointed,3,"At the beginning this was an ideal car, roomy enough for 6, excellent features, sporty look. But after only an year and 12000 miles I started visiting the service. ABS sensors, noisy steering, and an axle broken! Looks like a Mercedes but with american quality."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Tom1714, 07/13/2007,Great Alternative to the Minivan,4,"I had eyed this one for about 3 months and finaly purchased.  The car is fun to drive and very elegant. Smooth ride and comfortable interior.  Mileage could be better, but for a large vehicle it is fine. Mileage for Pacifica was better than my old GMC Jimmy and my wifes Town and Country.  You can tell the difference in mileage if you drive it correctly. If you accelerate hard you can feel the dollars being sucked out of your pocket!  Overall love the Pacifica and would by from Chrysler again."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Steve B., 10/19/2007,Ideal Choice,3,"My wife and I spent a few months trying to decide on a suitable family vehicle. I no longer wanted a minivan, and the 4+ seats SUVs were too expensive. She convinced me to get the Pacifica, and after 30k miles, we're still enjoying it with hardly any issues. I really recommend this vehicle, though a little too much to drive as a commute vehicle everyday."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Teri, 10/25/2007,It's an OK vehicle,3,"I bought this vehicle last year because I needed a vehicle with more leg room.  I thought the exterior was very sharp looking considering it's essentially a stationwagon/suv.  I had a VW Jetta with turbo but with the two kids didn't have hardly any leg room.  Initially, I really loved the vehicle but after some time I'm already looking for a new vehicle. The interior is pretty and there is plenty of leg room but when you have to use the 3rd row seats you can't fit a thing in the back. Gas mileage should be better and the vehicle needs a little more oomph/pick up when you need to accelerate quickly (I feel like a grandma driving this thing sometimes)."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,DCB, 03/17/2008,2006 Pacific Experience,4,"I very much enjoyed this vehicle. Comfort, Style, Reliability, Performance, Road handling have exceeded my expectations from an American made auto product. However, I have just exceeded 36,000 miles and seem to be burning oil. I know this was/is a problem for the 2004 and 2005 model years. Wondering if any other 2006 PAC owners have same experience with burning oil between changes?"
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Angry 1, 03/19/2008,Hunk Of Junk,2,"I bought this car, loaded and thought I would be so happy with it. Little did I know a week after I bought it, it would end up in the shop for a week and a half. A month after that it was in the shop for 4 days for the same exact problem, something with the rocker arms, and problems with the ABS.  The car has been nothing but problems and wish I never bought it. Beautiful inside and out but built with tape and glue. Do yourself a favor and don't even consider the car. I was told it was not safe to drive at all. The dealership and Chrysler were no help at all, telling me I was on my own as there was nothing they could tell me and I had not purchased the extended warranty. "
chrysler,pacifica,2006,E & S, 03/21/2008,Excellent SUV Alternative That Tows,4,"Excellent Styling. Come on guys it gets very decent gas mileage for a 4400 plus vehicle. Great to show up at a wedding with, or tow your boat to the local ramp. Plenty of power with 250 H.P., however you some what feel the weight of this beautiful beast on a steep incline. I feel the designers of this vehicle did not market this vehicle right from beginning to end, if they did they would consider future production of the Pacifica with improvements. Shame on you marketing team."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,paulsnj, 06/11/2012,First salesman's car for me that is not a van!,4,"Just picked up this car after much soul-searching to replace my 2005 Dodge Grand Caravan that I owned for 135K of its 183K miles driven.
This car had some interesting options for a base model: Heated leather seats and a CD changer (I am 43 and still do not own an I-pod).
Also only 48K miles but I will be racking them up pretty fast.
Very solid heavy vehicle with the 3.5 V6. Would have liked the 3.8 as in my van, but was not available in 2006.
Not the fastest off the line, my van was a bit quicker, but great highway cruiser.
No third row in the base, but five people in it over the weekend had no issues.
If you don't want a van and can put up with slightly smaller size it's worth a look."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,JuliaL., 04/06/2008,Love This Vehicle!,4,"I bought this vehicle slightly used in 2006 and have not a single regret!  I have three children and the space is perfect, not to big or small.  The gas mileage is great, I use synthetic oil.  This vehicle is a dream for a single mom like myself, very reliable.  Not a problem, not a complaint here!"
chrysler,pacifica,2006,jetfan2012, 12/20/2012,So Far So GREAT,4,"I purchased my 2006 Pacifica (base model) in May of 2012. The price was right and since I don't have a long commute, there was no need for all the extras (I drive about 3 minutes to the commuter parking lot). On the weekends, when running errands it is great. I usually have my daughter and my neice in the back and after about 30 minutes, they fall asleep. The ride is so smooth and comfortable and spacious, anyone who rides in the backseat falls asleep. The truck space? SO MUCH ROOM! "
chrysler,pacifica,2006,nate, 04/11/2008,Pacifica review,3,It has been very dependable we had a trailer hitch installed and it has pulled a trailer over 200 miles one-way to our cabin with no problems.
chrysler,pacifica,2006,nettech, 08/28/2011,"Solid, low cost Mommy-Mobile.",4,"We've had our 2006 Pacifica for a year now, and it has been a blessing for us as new parents.
The amount of things one needs to carry around for a baby is staggering, and our old Corolla wasn't cutting it.
Its comfortable, feels very smooth and solid while driving, and holds quite a bit of stuff, making it perfect for weekend shopping trips.
Only real downside so far has been the fuel economy (about 16-18 mpg on average, quite a contrast to a Corolla), but we knew that going in.
We purchased it in 2010 from a wholesaler for $10,900, which was a significant discount from its $28,000 sticker price.
If it continues to run for the next 4-5 years without any major repairs, we'll be happy."
chrysler,pacifica,2006,Cindy, 05/28/2008,Great SUV crossover,4,It's a fun car to drive.  It handles well in snow.  I like the idea of having a minivan size but a SUV look and handling features.  It's comfortable to drive with lots of storage and plenty of sitting.

chrysler,pacifica,2006,Allie37, 07/23/2019,Love My Pacifica....However!,4,"This is 2019 and I bought my 06 Chrysler Pacifica used about 4 years ago with somewhere around 126,000 miles on it. My mom bought her 07 Pacifica about 6 months before me. I liked it because it had a 3rd row and I could fit all 4 kids in it with no problem. I love the space it offers when folding down the seats. I've hauled just about everything in it. I like the interior, the comfort, style and look of it. I have the DVD system which came in handy for trips. Stereo and CD player are great too. However, shortly after my mom purchased hers, (at only 90 some thousand miles), her tranny went out and had to have it replaced. Shortly after that, my tranny went out, (about 130,000 miles), and had to be replaced along with a motor mount. My Pacifica is now at about 157,000 miles and I've had to replace 3 new motor mounts, struts, tires, and some other things as well. Must be a Pacifica thing with the transmission. I was told the transmission can't keep up with the motor. I have regular maintenance (oil changes, fluids checked, changed, and topped off) every 5,000 miles. Other than that, I love my crossover and can't beat the price.

I have heard numerous negative comments from others about the Pacifica over the years, but have absolutely no complaints.  We have been very disciplined about the maintenance, and even spent a few thousand in repairs in the past few years to get it in tip-top shape.  But I still really like this car.  It is the best vehicle I have ever driven in the snow, and with new bushings, still drives smoothly.  With over 130,000 miles, it still is a great car.

chrysler,pacifica,2007,db60, 05/23/2012,Third year of enjoyment,4,"Having purchased our Pacifica as it came off a Chrysler lease in 2009, we could not be happier with the performance, handling and comfort that we enjoy.
 Our Pacifica is the W.P. Chrysler Signature Series, and this mean upgraded leather, radio and other features that make this an enjoyable vehicle.

The interior is a dream.
The Navigation is in the center of the speedometer and is simular to
heads up displays.
The capability to handle 7 (that is right 7) DVD's between the radio and the external changer makes long trip with Grandkids actually fun.


The four captain chairs (all heated with individual controls) are extremely comfortable.
Toad trips of 6 to 7 hours are not unheard."
chrysler,pacifica,2007,Jason5, 01/08/2007,Excellent Choice,4,"I traded in a 2000 Dodge Sedan for the roomier Touring FWD in Magnesium. I shopped minivans and SUVs--needing a 3rd row for people and space for cargo hauling--and found this the better choice.  I'm extremely pleased with the 07's power, handling, ride and features.  So far fuel mileage has exceeded my expectations for the 4.0 with 6 speed.  No less than 19.6 mpg in mixed town and highway and a high of 24 on the Interstate at um ""good"" speeds.  Dealer experience was one of the best in memory as was the value.  I recommend you consider the Pacifica.  "

New engine is very quie. Love all the extras, GPS and the back up camera and warning system. LOVE THIS CAR! Dealership is excellent also. This is car # 12 from them.   "
chrysler,pacifica,2007,Garth Stapon, 11/20/2010,Underrated Performer poor MPG - in City,4,"This car is extremely comfortable. The six speed transmission gives decent highway mileage. We have seen some minor reliability issues. The axle seal on the transmission was leaking and that was covered under warranty. There were also some paint cracks on the hood which is made of plastic and that was also repaired by warranty. I found a cracked / chipped brake caliper on my car at 60,000 miles. The part was available as an  aftermarket part for $40 with a return of the core. We upgraded to drilled / slotted rotors on the front wheels and that enhanced braking. The temperature control system is sweet and the driver seat is VERY adjustable. The power is adequate. Traction control GREAT!"
chrysler,pacifica,2007,A.R., 11/26/2006,"Quality Good, Gas Mileage Not",4,"My 2007 Pacifica has the best fit and finish I have ever seen in any Chrysler product. It is also very comfortable, performs well, and has a great ride.  It handles very well for a vehicle its weight.  However, if you buy one and you believe you are going to get the EPA rated 16 city 24 highway mileage, you are dreaming! I don't know whether Chrysler has to provide certified results regarding the EPA numbers, but if they do, they are ""fudging"" big time.  13-14 city and 18-19 highway is more like it."
chrysler,pacifica,2007,Linda, 09/28/2016,My 07 Pacifica was screaming for me to sit in it.,5,"Once i did, it was over.  This is my first and newest vehicle I have ever owned.  When I peeped inside I immediately saw the 3rd row seat!  I got in and loved the look and feel.  As a grandmother of 3 and 1 child, the 3rd row was perfect.  As a person that likes to travel 12-14 hours to my second home, again perfect.  The vehicle is roomy, all controls are placed where easy to get to.  I love the arm rest as well.  The instrument panel is very attractive.  I love the lights.  My side mirrors do something crazy (but I love it) when dark.  Never seen such a thing on a vehicle!  The rearview mirror is the same.  Oh, can't forget about the memory seat positions.  I love that.  I can hit #2 and the seat moves back so I can get out easy (I'm close cause I'm short).  Then one day I noticed that when I open the door, the seat automatically goes to position #1.  Me.  I put it on the road about 45 minutes east of my home and the ride was so smooth.  I also love, although didn't know how to work it before hand, the shifter is pretty cool.  Overall, I love this vehicle and wish this one had been available when I made my first purchase of a 2001 Hyundai Santa Fe.  I feel like I am riding in luxury.

The tansmission shifts hard. Motor and transmission mounts go bad and the afteraftermarket ones don't last so you have to buy them from a chrysler dealer around $200 each list price. Egr valve goes out on these too. Front control arm bushings fail, front swaybar bushings wear out and cause clunking in front end. Around 150000 miles the radiator and a/c condensor failed. We liked the car but to many repairs are needed.

chrysler,pacifica,2007,Kevin, 09/03/2017,Couldn't be any more pleased!,5,"Purchased from Carmax with 17,000 miles on it, in 2009. I honestly couldn't have asked for a better vehicle. It's been mechanically sound, offers plenty of interior room, is comfortable to drive, is extremely practical, and has just been a great car. Because of that, I've owned it much longer than I would have any other, and have delayed a new purchase because of my happiness with this vehicle. The only challenge I've had is regarding the heating & air conditioning, and it's stumped the mechanic, but it's always been fixed. I actually figured out the problem recently, and replaced the ac blower motor and resistor, and it's as good as new. Love, love love this vehicle, and so wish they made the new Pacifica with similar body style, comparatively speaking. The new model is essentially a minivan, and who wants a minivan...

We have taken our Pacifica to Canada and back on many occasions, and all around its a comfy ride, very spacious, and my son loves it!!  I would recommend the AWD touring edition for snow dwellers. "
chrysler,pacifica,2007,Garth, 07/12/2009,Under Rated Over Performer,4,This car is great. We had a killer winter in New England last year and we had a set of Goodyear snow tires installed and with 4 wd this was a cacoon against anything that winter threw at us. Braking and confort are out standing. We had one mechanical problem with a transmission axel seal that was repaired under warranty. The car is quiet and the six speed transmission is very smooth on acceleration but sometimes get confused on quick stops or when doing a rolling stop when the light changes before a complete stop. It clucks and Chrysler flased the transmission which has improved shifting. The 4.0 L motor is a gem and works well on regular gas (89 octane is suggested). 5 star crash rating!!!!
chrysler,pacifica,2007,werx, 03/22/2011,Great used buy...if you're a grease monkey,4,"Let's first all agree that cars are built to break.
Every car is going to have problems and failures...it's how much you enjoy driving the car and how practical it is for your particular needs that makes a car worth it.

That being said...I love driving the pacifica.

It rides great.
It's quiet. It's loaded with features.
It's safe. It's big enough to haul to 2 kids also.

I've had to replace the usual Chrysler culprits like suspension bushings and motor mounts.
The regular maintenance of the car (oil,brakes,transmission fluid) are all on par if not above par with every other car I've owned."

Our 2007 was a nice vehicle, rode great and we put over 60,000 miles on it between early 2007 and Jan. 4th 2010.  We have 3 kids and with a roof bag, we vacationed and drove in style and comfort all over.  Problems were limited to a few warning lights which the dealer promptly fixed.  We liked the way it drove and the space. The look was ""spot-on"" for us too. Power was good, fuel economy was fine but not great, and shifting was a little odd sometimes but not bothersome (some people over-react to that).  We were so impressed by it's safety and features - we bought another 2007 Limited used one to replace it."

Marine Blue is great and they have thought of everything. Crash tests and roll over 5 of 5, not too many SUV can say that. The all speed traction control and ESP are standard as well"

A while later it was lunging forward and jerking at times when accelerating. Dealer could not find anything wrong. Took it back several times before they finally found the problem. It has been in for transmission repairs 4 times. Last week when I went to take my kids to school, it would not move. The emergency brake spring broke and shot through my rear brake.  ABS light and traction control problems are constant! Look up complaints on the Pacifica and you will find out a lot. I would never purchase a Chrysler vehicle again.

I have replaced a total of 7 in 45,000 miles.
I am not on my 2nd coolant leak.

We've now had it for 2 1/2 years and it's only been back to the dealership for free car washes.  (Knock on wood.)  Lots of room for 4.  Very back seat small.  Nice riding.  Easily the fanciest car we've owned.   After safety, reliability is the #1 concern for me.  This car has been tremendous in that department.  Nothing but oil changes for the first 30 months.   Gas mileage isn't great but it is big and safe.  The FWD does sometimes make me feel like I am holding on to the steering wheel for dear life, esp. when accelerating quickly while turning.  I am sorry to those who have had trouble but I just haven't had one issue."

chrysler,pacifica,2007,Garth, 10/31/2008,They Get it Right Then Kill It,4,"The first thing that struck us about this car is the styling. Although they built it in their minivan plant, it is a much better looking car. The updates for 2007 are a must have. The 6 speed transmission is giving us around 17 mpg in mixed city and highway driving. We see better than 22 if highway speeds are kept at a reasonable level. I agree that the more powerful motor and extra two gears in the transmission help the car to be quick off the line but it is also one of the most relaxed highway cruisers that we have ever driven. The crash ratings are unmatched in its class. The seats are very comfortable and the dual zone climate with rear heat control means that everyone is comfortable. "

Driven it to Bend, Portland, New Mexico, Texas, Santa Barbara, San Diego and many other trips between. 38,000 miles already in 2 years and I have no worries. It is a great looking car in addition.  Everywhere I go someone mentions how they like the design. Cadillac and Toyota liked it so much they copied it. I added a roof rack and a trailer hitch for the gear and bicycles for the longer jaunts where the Pacifica shines due to its comfort. Keeping this car forever."

The interior is very comfortable.  The sound system is good and the DVD entertainment is very clear.  With the 255 horsepower engine and a 4500 lb vehicle, the gas mileage is something that we will accept and live with.  Overall, I wish I had bought one sooner.

Six adults can ride and have plenty of room. The seats fold down and make it easy to haul all kinds of things, big and small. It drives very well. Smooth riding for all passengers.

I think a lot of the Pacifica owners are having issues with the 4 speed and the 3.5 liter.
The 6 speed and the 4.0 have been flawless.
Comfort is excellent as are the looks.
Bought the car brand new and havn't had one regret.
Probably buy another one soon, buick is getting old and I looked at the price of a 2008 Toyota Sienna $29,000, when a 2008 Pacifica is going for $13,000 with the same miles.

Driving it easy, with the 6 speed transmission, I was getting 19.8 in town, and 29.9 on the highway. It rides so smooth, and the performance is unbelievable! It is totally state of art. Load leveling, traction control, ABS, anti-out of control feature? Over 250 HP. 3500 towing tounge wt. I love my Pacifica. I plan on keeping it for a long time.

Engine performance is very good for only 200hp and a 4,400lb curb weight. Really powerful around town, breaks the front tires loose easily. Passing power (45-70) isn't that great, but not too bad. Handles curves very well considering larger size. Surprisingly, its a very good tow vehicle. Hardly can tell the trailer 2,000lb trailer is back there. Interior has held up well, but the seats get dirty very easily. Regardless, interior is beautiful and well put together. Love the sleek exterior, the car gets many compliments. I average 22mpg.

chrysler,pacifica,2007,William, 09/20/2009,So Far So Good,4,"Just purchased a Base Pacifica, I am a traveling sales representative. It is nice to have room for samples and golf clubs. I put over 1,000 miles my first week and so far I like it. I hope it proves to be a reliable vehicle. The only complaint thus far is the large blind spots but the big mirrors help a little.  William"
chrysler,pacifica,2007,Don_B, 01/08/2010,A real surprise,4,"I bought this car at the Chrysler dealership in Tupelo, MS so a road trip was in order just to get home.  The ride was extremely comfortable for the 3.5 hour trip.  The average gas mileage (Most of trip driven between 70~75mph) was 23.8 mpg.  Second trip to In-Laws resulted in as average gas mileage of 24 mpg.  This particular car came off of a Chrysler Lease and had 20,137 mile on it.  The fit and finish in this car are excellent and road noise is only moderate (belief that this is due to the type of tires).  Power is very good, and transmission shifts cleanly.  The car came with about 90% of all options and we had the Factory DVD installed.  Since we have had it, two road trips - No issues"
chrysler,pacifica,2007,OHWHYDIDI BUY, 10/27/2008,Mostly dealer ignorance,4,"Bought this car because I drove several test vehicles at work and was impressed. Tracked down an '07 (deals were sweet with employee price + rebate). Found an AWD Touring with the NAV package.  Drove great for about 40 miles, then the suspension clunking started and the water pouring in through the rear roof at the first hard rainfall. The list goes on.  Dealer resolved the leak (missing gasket on the roof antenna) and the other defects.  The bad ball joint sound is still present and both dealers (went in 7 times in 2 months) say that it's a ""normal"" sound. I wonder why the 5 I drove at work didn't do that.  Dealer says it's annoying but they all do it. Crappy uncaring dealers."
chrysler,pacifica,2007,William, 04/23/2010,Update,4," I am a traveling Sales Rep and have put 30,000 miles on my Pacifica since 10/09.  I still like the interior and ride. It does on ocasion groan in the driver side front end when I turn right. The tranmission on ocasion shifts hard. Other than those two issues has been a slightly above average car.  Thanks!  William"

chrysler,pacifica,2007,Steve, 12/09/2006,07 changes!,4,"I just leased my second Pacifica and Chrysler made all the changes that the car need over the 05 model. Bigger engine, back  up camera and just a few nice features to make a great car even better!! The lease programs on this car are the best out there! I am driving a $41,000 dollar car for under $600 a month on a two year lease!  15k per year and no money down. This deal cannot be beat! This is a lot of car!"
chrysler,pacifica,2007,kbern, 12/31/2006,Great Family Car,4,Exceptionally comfortable ride.  Good cargo space.  A lot of car for the money.  Good engine pick-up.  Very pleased with the quality of the vehicle. For being a small six cylinder it has very good pick up. 
chrysler,pacifica,2007,robin, 10/11/2009,what have i done,2,i purchased my pacifica from carmax in raleigh and it has been nothing but trouble.  i purchased it on 16 aug 09 and it has been in the shop 4 times and this last time they still don't know what's wrong with it.  each time i took it to be repaired the techs kept telling me the noises were normal.  it took the sup of service to ride with me to tell them the noises weren't normal.  the car has been with them more than with me.  maybe they should be making the payment.  
chrysler,pacifica,2007,Disappointed Again, 09/27/2010,Frustrated,2,"Received a very good deal but traded one lemon for another. Bought new in '07 multiple dealer visits for clunky transmission, seat shedding foam, ext and int trim fading not aligned, brake rotors bad,heater/air not working, engine oil consumption so on and so on. Bad rotors with less than 9000 miles that's bad quality. Multiple dealer overnight stays and lots of frustration. Third brand new Chrysler dud. Had a 2001 Voyager and 2001 Sebring both with multiple warranty issues both traded in within 1 year of owning due to lack of confidence in vehicle. Decided to try again after 6 years hoped for better got worse. No joke have had upwards of 40 warranties with this vehicle."
chrysler,pacifica,2007,J Bentley, 12/26/2007,Excellent Performance,5,"I just purchased this vehicle in late December for $9,000 under MSRP. My wife and I are expecting our first child in June and need a vehicle to accomadate. The front, rear and side 5 star impact rating was important in our decision to purchase. The exterior styling is very aggressive and sporty looking.  The interior is well designed but I understand why people have commented about the cheap materials used for construction in newer Chysler/Dodge vehicles. The performance and ride is what makes this vehicle stand apart from the competition. Acceleration is outstanding and the ride is very smooth and quiet. Caught myself speeding a few times well above the limit. Can corner fast without fear."
chrysler,pacifica,2007,Robert Phillips, 09/17/2009,LEMON,2,"Purchased the Pacifica used with 5,900 miles on it. Nothing but trouble. We owned two 05's and they were good one great one fair. We liked the car. THEN the tyranny started bucking (Would not down shift when going up an incline, (Not fixed we were told this is a problem with the Pacifica. Motor mounts four sets in 20,000 miles. The dealer says this is normal and a better mount has not been designed because the Pacifica has been discontinued. Good luck when the warranty is up. The trim has (all but three pieces) has been replaced and is spotting again. The drivers seat shreds the seat cushion when the seat motor is engaged, AWFUL NOW a noise is starting to come in the front suspension! "
chrysler,pacifica,2007,angela, 11/16/2009,DO NOT BUY,2,This car has been nothing but problems. Since I have bought this car in o7 it has been in the shop over 20 times.  They keep finding problems but then the big problem keeps happening.  When accelerating we lose all power and the car shakes uncontrollably. It has had flight recorders installed and still nothing.  Still trying to resolve the issue however the dealership stinks.  We have already sued Chrysler and have settled.  I would never purchase a Chrysler again. Thinking about selling which will result in us losing money
chrysler,pacifica,2007,Phil, 02/10/2008,"Great buy, Enthusiastic after 7 months",5,"Wanted to replace a 10 year old stationwagon with another one. After looking for two months at all makes and models of wagons, decided the Pacifica fit all my needs.  After 7 months and 13,000 miles I wasn't wrong. It's more than what I expected.  Great sport sedan handling. I sit up there with other SUV's and P/Us.  It's one of the best kept secrets in the car world.  The only thing missing is the pointed 3 star in a circle, but my bank account is not out an extra $20,000.  It's the first time I've owned an AWD and even though I lose a couple of miles a gallon, at 65 years old I've got peace of mind while driving on ice and snow.  A safe car for hauling my grandkids around. "

chrysler,pacifica,2007,Johnny Ximenez, 09/28/2018,MPG IS HORRIBLE!,3,"I bought a used 2007 Pacifica 4.0 in 2018. Had it for 5 months. The vehicle drives good. Motor sounds great. Took it to a regular mechanic and ran a code test and shows ZERO on codes. Not sure whether to take it to a dealer to see if it makes a difference.  Before I bought the vehicle I read that it's supposed to be 17/20MPG. I am getting about 12.8MPG. Mechanic can't seem to find issue cause there are no codes, tires are properly inflated,  air filter not bad, motor sounds good. ANY SUGGESTIONS??? HELP!!! This is with AC running of course. Vehicle has 80,000. Mechanic says it's to early for tune up cause these vehicles can go 100 000 miles before its first tune up

chrysler,pacifica,2007,danyella3_21, 06/17/2008,I'm in love!!,4,"I've had my Pacifica for about 2 months and I absolutely LOVE it. The interior is huge and very comfortable. The seats all easily fold down for storage. I love the radio controls on the steering wheel..right behind it, in the perfect spot. Every seat has it's own cup holder and air vents. I like the captain seats on the second row with the console in the middle. It rides 5-6 adults comfortably. The air bag in the front seat is cut on/off by weight, which is great for the 8-year- old that likes to ride in the front. There's rubber in the bottom of the cup holders that pulls out, so it's easy to clean messes! Dual air is great. I'm seriously in love!"
chrysler,pacifica,2007,David, 07/23/2008,What a nice surprise,4,"I had to get a car for a new sales job where I travel daily. Needed more room for people, and displays. I traded in my Lexus which I just loved, I never thought that the Pacifica could ever compare with the Lexus.  Was I surprised. I got a 2007 touring model with the 4.0 and 6 speed trans. This is by far the quietest, nicest riding, comfortable car I have ever owned. The stock stereo with Sirius satellite is unbelievable with a pounding bass and clear sound even at high levels. The ride rivals that of the finest European cars. ( I have owned BMW and Lexus prior). The 4.0 has plenty of get up and go and very fun to drive. Love the interior and get plenty of compliments on the styling.Love it"
chrysler,pacifica,2007,Donna, 09/24/2008,Love This Car,4,This is my second Pacifica. I love this car. I have had Cadillacs and Lincolns and this car has a lot better ride. The comfort is awesome. People get in and can't believe how much room it has. I have heard that Chrysler is going to stop making them. I hope this is not true.

chrysler,pacifica,2007,nothappy, 10/30/2008,Not Reliable,4,"I agree with many of the reviews that I read-- the car is a great design however, at 10,000 miles this car lost it. The transmission was ""clunky"" and with several transmission upgrades it seems to just keep coming back- as many of the others! It has broken down twice due to a gas gauge/ tank problems- as I am learning a not so rare issue. For this-- it is unreliable! After numerous trips to the dealer it still happens. I am tired of it! Why would this car come with a 6 disc DVD changer and no screen? Broken motor mounts- also common in the 2007."
chrysler,pacifica,2007,krissymom, 01/02/2009,Mileage not that great,3,"Never get over 18 mpg on highway, lucky those who do. I get the clumping also, and my pedal sticks (my 1996 Saturn did this also) how annoying. I love the style, the drive, the look. I wish that there were no console in the middle of the 2nd seats for ease of getting into the 3rd row-- my kids have footprints all over it. "

This one - not so good.  There was a recall on it before I drove it off the lot and the dealership never told me. Then my transmission started acting ""funny"", now my engine light seems to always be on.  All I can say is that I am not happy with the performance of my 2007. If I could give it back, I would.  Sorry Chrysler but you lost me with this one.  "

chrysler,pacifica,2007,richmondtexas, 04/25/2008,Love/hate with this car,3,"The Pacifica has unique styling, very nice appearance and great interior layout. Has an upscale look & feel. I bought the Signature Series which is loaded up w/ navigation, power liftgate, rear seat DVD, satellite radio, heated seats front & back. Signature Series interior scheme set this one apart from other Pacificas. Pleanty of power and a smooth ride. The bad: in 12 months and 10,000 miles of driving, this vehicle has been through 3 torque converters, both sway bars links, a driveshaft, had a side view mirror come off and had a splash guard (the big sheet of plastic in the wheel well) fall off. Worst of all, trade in value is less than half of new MSRP ($34540). Appraised @ $16k."

The exterior fit & finish are good but has one minor door mis- alignment.  Paint finish is excellent.  The interior is most comfortable. We get 26+ MPG on the highway and in-town mileage at 19+ MPG.  We're very pleased with the fuel mileage.  Ours is FWD with the 4.0 L engine & had only 14K miles when we bought it. I love the 6 speed tranny with the ""Power-Shift"" feature; but I am concerned about it's reliability as I read there have been problems with the TQ.  Time will tell! "
chrysler,pacifica,2007,JPacips, 07/17/2008,"Great Option, Buy a Pacifica",4,"We purchased our Pacifica to replace my wife's VW Passat. With only 1 kid, and a growing family we needed something larger, but not as large as a mini van. Not quite to soccer mom status yet. The 4.0 L is a great engine with adequate power, and plenty of pep. 6sp transmission is very smooth. Handles great. The back hatch is almost exactly 48"" inches wide (at it's widest) I just put a sign in it the other day with all 4 back seats down, worked great. The one major draw back is backing up. There is a pretty big blind spot, and it takes some getting used to. Back up sensors would be helpful(didn't come with ours). My wife loves to drive it, we highly recommend this car! too bad no more after '08"
chrysler,pacifica,2007,Peter, 10/30/2008,Good Performance,4,"My first Chrysler. It is great price with the features to match.

Ive never driven the older model so I can only imagine how that engine was.  Roomy and comfortable, I also like the standard safety equipment, traction control, and ESP.

This is a distinctively styled, great looking vehicle.  It handles extremely well, has great pep, is supremely comfortable, and can haul a ton of stuff.  No matter what highway speed you select, the engine is basically loafing (about 2000 rpm's)and has all the power you'll need for any situation.  I was a little concerned on gas mileage at first (17 mpg with a mix of city and highway), but it has improved steadily to a now acceptable 21 mpg.  For a vehicle with this much power and space, I can live with that."

This is one of the best made vehicles Chrysler has ever built! The AWD is fantastic, and the plush interior is top quality!

chrysler,pacifica,2007,jdt, 05/31/2008,Good buy if you get a used one,4,"I bought this vehicle because my wife and I wanted a vehicle with a 3rd row that wasn't a mini van and got better than 20 mpg.  I picked this out because the price was right.  I bought it used with 10,xxx at under $18k.  I'm a big guy at over 6 ft and 285 and I can comfortably get into the front and back seats, but I haven't tried the 3rd row (I own it so I don't have to ride back there.)  MPG has been around 21.5 since we bought it.  It has more of a car like ride than most SUVs but you still feel some roll on harder turns (it is based on a mini van frame).  It is a comfortable ride for long trips, and has plenty pickup around town.  Overall I'm pleased with what I got for the money."

chrysler,pacifica,2007,Les Heinrich, 02/06/2007,Read this before buying Chrysler,3,We purchased a 2007 Chrysler Pacifica and were happy until we had it washed.  After washing we noticed that all chrome trim pieces were etched or corroded.  We had less than 2000 miles and had the car only 7 weeks.  We returned to the dealer and were told they would contact Chrysler.  We have now had 3 conversations with Chrysler and they have basically said too bad that it is a normal condition in areas that use Mag Chloride on highways.  I believe this is a defect in the fabricating process since we have had a 1999 T&C van for over 8 years and show no sign of this problem.  This may be a problem in several northern tier states.  Beware before buying Chrysler in snow areas. Very Disappointed
chrysler,pacifica,2007,TRETIAK, 03/10/2007,great experience,4,"This Pacifica is Great!I through out my back this fall and it was hard to get down and sit in my sedan the seat height is perfect. I checked out 5 suv/ crossover types (Trebeca,XC90,SRX,Murano,Highlander),the Pacifica was the most comfortable seating the best support for my back. It is roomier than the others, the third seat is even comfortable with adults. The placement of all the controls are convenient when driving. I especially like the electric seat controls, they are laid out just like a seat on the door, the lumbar control,even the adjustable peddles,and the heat seat controls. Plenty of power with new 4.0 engine and the new 6 speed transmission with AWD and having 6 adults on board."

Just finished a 2500 mile trip.  Average city MPG is 18.5 and 26 MPG on the highway doing 75.  Would get 32 if I kept it at 60-65.  10% ethanol cuts mileage by 10-20%.

With all the goodies that came as standard equipment coupled with the optional packages, the price was very surprising. This is my 6th Chrysler.

There are so many cool features that it's hard to name them all.  Suffice it to say that I'm very happy with my purchase and I'd recommend a Pacifica to anyone."
chrysler,pacifica,2007,vkeiper, 03/24/2007,"2007 Signature series, favorite SUV yet!",4,"Just got the pacifica a few days ago. I was replacing an Eddie Bauer Expedition. I was able to find a Signature series with every option except the power moon roof. I love the location of the Navigation (in the dash cluster). The 19.5"" wheels really make a nice add on. It does not lack any power and every gadget you can possibly ask for. We were looking at the Lincoln MKX but wanted a 3rd row seat and I am so glad we chose this vehicle. The ride is much quieter and smoother than the expedition was and  not much less room. I was really surprised at the amount of space, I thought it was going to be tight once we got the whole family loaded in with the car seats and all."
chrysler,pacifica,2007,Peri , 04/07/2007,Above all expectations,5,"My Touring Signature Series performs much better than my expectations. The combination of the well-tuned 4.0 liter engine with the 6-speed gear, plus the smooth auto-stick gear, gives this car an outstanding perfomance. Moreover, the Pacifica looks awesome and stylish. It is worthy every single penny. "
chrysler,pacifica,2007,KimPgh, 04/17/2007,Why drive anything else,4,"This is my 2nd Pacifica. First one had many upgrades. I got the Limited AWD this time. Only thing missing is the kitchen sink. Chrysler improved the engine with the 4.0. It has great pickup vs 2004, has better gas mileage too. Passenger windows are same grade as the windshield keeps outside noise to a min. Love the DVD w/wireless headphones(no tangling). People in front can listen to their favorites on beautiful stereo system, with subwoofers. Nicer design on the outside. The Pacifica says move over. 4700 lbs of safety for my family. Suede and leather heated seats are a must. You can adjust everything to your liking. Looking forward to this car on long trips. This is the meaning of true luxury"
chrysler,pacifica,2007,mrktwatchr, 03/31/2007,Very Happy With Purchase,4,Have had this vehicle for 9 months and we love it. Very comfortable and a dream to drive. it's very stable on the road. Solid 
chrysler,pacifica,2007,GREGG, 04/07/2007,Happy Camper,5,"The favorite options moonroof, heated seats, power lift gate, and nav system. I picked the Pac up in VA and drove it to NY. 24 MPG cruising at 75. I would think the mileage could only get better. The reach into the back from the back of the car with the 3rd row seats folded down is a bit of a stretch but tolerable to get those grocery bags. The Pac is a great cruiser. We will see how Mom does around town. So far, she is beyond thrilled with the car. If the Pac, long term, is 1/2 as good as the '96 T&C we had, we will all be smiling. "
chrysler,pacifica,2007,Annette Brady, 04/15/2007,Happier Than When I First Bought,5,I just returned from three months in Florida and am happier than my first report. Car averaged 18 mpg. for local driving. and 25.7 on the trip back to Ohio. Driving in the South you have to atay at 80+ to keep from being run over. Car is a dream on the road!!
chrysler,pacifica,2007,Wendy, 04/17/2007,My 4th Pacifica,4,"My first Pacifica was bought back by Chrysler after 3 mo. The next one had minor problems and traded it in after 1 yr. 3rd one, Touring was great. Lease was almost up and with Chrysler push forward program, I got into a new one earlier. I went for the Limited with everything. I especially love the 4.0 engine. What a ride. The '07 is by far the best one yet."
chrysler,pacifica,2007,mrpops, 05/14/2007,Great Road Car,4,I bought my vehicle in Oct 2004. We travel a lot and always use this vehicle. It is comfortable and road steady. All vehicles should have the same feel. I wish the floor was flat when the rear seats are laid down. Good capacity.
chrysler,pacifica,2007,mremic, 07/11/2007,Not Just For Dad,4,"Purchased this vehicle for my Father and Mother. Dad and Mom are at 80 this year and I noticed them having trouble getting in and out of their old car. They looked and drove other makes, but decided on the 300. When we got to the dealership I asked them to look at   the Pacifica. He fell in love with it, and ""damn those SUV's on the road, I can't see around them"" attitude, was a thing of the past. Mom's quote ""Its so big, I don't like it"". They have since driven to PA. on a trip, and Mom, now on her 1 millionth trip to the store, loves ""being up there"". They  still smile when I ask them, how's the car now?"
chrysler,pacifica,2007,GREGG, 07/18/2007,3.5 Months and still very happy,4,"All is well with our '07 Pac. We were finally able to get out of the house for a wedding in RI and all four of us piled in. The Nav system was fantastic!  The fuel economy was equally fantastic, averaging 65-70 mph we yielded 26 MPG carrying a load of about 900 lbs.  Around town we get 15 mpg.  Honestly, we could do 800-1000 miles in a day with this vehicle. Between the DVD in the back, 4 heated, adjustable, tilting seats, the Nav system, and a 23 gallon fuel tank it was effortless. We stopped for lunch after 2.75 hrs and my son (6'4"", 220 lbs) could not believe we were in the car that long. He was involved in the movies in the back  seats. Most importantly, my wife loves it!"
chrysler,pacifica,2007,Michael Franks, 07/24/2007,A Great Crossover,4,"2007 Pacifica really takes this car to another level. New 4.0L V-6 and 6- speed tranny provide the performance transfusion that makes this a fun to drive vehicle, and fulfills its promise as a true car-like crossover vehicle.  Steering response is improved, interior noise is down and the rear camera is helpful.  Nice job Chrysler."
chrysler,pacifica,2007,davison, 07/22/2007,good pacifica,5,car is fun drive andhas excellent pickup and response. smooth on the highway and extremely quiet
chrysler,pacifica,2007,kragtj, 08/08/2007,'07 Pacifica Torque Converter,4,"Just replaced my wife's '04 Pacifica with an '07 WD Signature Series. The bigger engines was definitely a big improvement. This one has much more zip, even with A/C on. The ride is smooth, comfortable and quiet. I could drive this thing all day. The gas mileage isn't the best...not yet close to the rated mpg. We like the style and the feeling of safety of this big vehicle. However, I just took the car back to the dealer at 3,000 miles as the transmission ""shudders at about 1800 RPM while moderately accelerating thru the gears. There is a TSB indicating this is a problem with AWD '07 Pacificas and the torque converter should be replaced. I hope this solves the problem. Otherwise, we love it! "
chrysler,pacifica,2007,turksoldier, 09/28/2007,Excellent Car for the Money,5,"I have a fully loaded limited AWD. This car has everything from GPS to back up camera, bluetooth , 4 heated seats and DVD player, not to forget the Sirius radio and only for 31K. The ride is so smooth and very powerful. The suspension is smooth but you still have the control of the car. The interior is very luxurious. 255 hp is under the hood when needed. "
chrysler,pacifica,2007,Brooke, 06/20/2007,Surprise,4,"I have driven an Audi Allroad for 6 yrs. Came home from a trip to Europe w30 hs students to find my car replaced w the Pacifca. Now, I understand my husband is a Detroit boy but I was thinking I was a NY girl in need of a lawyer. Turns out the Audi needed a part that would take 6 weeks get here from Germany and it wasn't practical to keep. After much loud grumbling, I drove it.  I have had the Pacifica for a week now and have to say it has as nice a ride and some features that I really enjoy. It is smooth and very comfortable.  The only problem I seem to have is nonretractable side mirrors. I haven't driven American in 12 yrs. It actually really suprises me."
chrysler,pacifica,2007,Vic, 07/18/2007,Happy,4,"We have enjoyed this vehicle very much.  It is fun to drive, and comfortable riding. It looks like a high priced luxuary vehicle.  Fuel ecomony on the low side but very powerful engine."
chrysler,pacifica,2007,Kathy, 08/16/2007,Superb comfort,4,"We love this car! Comfortable for 4 adults on a 4000 mile trip, with room to spare (using a roof carrier). We consistently averaged 23-24 mpg on the interstate systems, driving 75 mph.  This vehicle is a replacement for a Lincoln Town Car, and it is every bit as comfortable"
chrysler,pacifica,2007,Julian, 09/30/2007,Good value for your money,5,"Great ride, lots of room, very nice looking vehicle, surprisingly good mileage especially on the highway. Seats are quite comfortably. A great value for the money."
chrysler,pacifica,2007,Big Chuck, 06/10/2007,Pacifica Fun to Drive,4,"This is my second Pacifica with even more refinements and comforts than my first one. I love the handing,  performance and safety features. I like the feel of sitting up higher than an ondinary sedan and performance is fine with the 4.0 L six."
chrysler,pacifica,2007,Jim Steiger, 07/21/2007,My Gold Pacifica,4,MUCH more room than my wife's Durango
chrysler,pacifica,2007,p-51driver, 07/30/2007,Happy customer,4,"Agree with excellent ride, great handling and DVD and video, ipod hookup etc are all great. Our in town mileage is 14-15. Our highway mileage is 26-27 at 75mph on the cruise control. Very comfortable and quiet for driver and passenger. "
chrysler,pacifica,2007,Raymond Nice, 08/08/2007,2007 Pacifica Limited,4,"The Pacifica Limited is very nice looking - exterior and interior.  We love all the features (it is loaded) and they all perform very well.  It is very quiet with lots of power and I am sure that it will go well in the snow.  We love the radio and the backup camera. If it is half the car that our Intrepid is (it has over 200,000 miles), we will be very satisfied."
chrysler,pacifica,2007,al hum, 09/02/2007,Love it!,4,"The ride It is roomy, even with tripletts in car seats. The instrument panel is easy seen,and we love the memory seat and mirrors. And it is easy enter and exit the vehicle...like driving a ""sports""van lots of room when third row seating not being used "
chrysler,pacifica,2007,Carol, 09/22/2007,Great car for the money,4,I have the Spring Edition  Lot of bells and whistles for the money.  Beautiful interior. Smooth ride.
chrysler,pacifica,2007,Bobby O., 10/22/2007,Best of Both Worlds,5,"I am a musician,  and I need a vehicle that can carry a lot of gear.  My worn out van was at the end of it's life and I was tired of getting no better than 15 MPG.  I tested many mid-size SUV's, and there are several good choices if you want a rugged ""off road sporty"" type of vehicle.  But I wanted something that could handle my cargo needs, drive like a true luxury car, provide lots of power with a smooth comfortable ride, has a stylish look and at a reasonable price.  The Pacifica is all that and more.  If you need a vehicle that can handle your big family, and/or some decent cargo loads, plus a smooth ride, lots of bells and whistles and some ""get up a go"", this is the one!  "
chrysler,pacifica,2007,stephanie, 11/18/2007,Great vehicle,4,We traded in a 04 Altima for the Pac. It was great car and really good on gas which I miss but we needed more room so we went to the Pacifica which my wife was looking at for a while anyway. She wanted 3rd row and I also wanted 4wd so I wouldn't have to worry about her on snowy days. The ride is al ot quieter than the Altima and smoother. A lot more room for are 2 girls. I love the looks inside and out. I was skeptical about the leather but so far I love it. The get up and go is great. like I said the mileage is ok but I have a Nissan Titan that gets about the same as the pac. The kids love riding in the way back and are always asking me to turn the radio up and go faster which gets me introuble with the wife.
chrysler,pacifica,2007,farout, 11/28/2007,Pacifica Touring AWD,5,The Pacifica is a real quality vehicle. The ride is so smooth! Fit and finish are almost flawless. Attention to every detail is evident inside and out. The Pacifica has value and quality at an affordable price.
chrysler,pacifica,2007,luxurycarlover, 11/27/2007,Fun!,4,"Our Chrysler Pacfica is great. It, in my opinion, is great looking. It has decent space, though obviously not as much as a minivan. It is comfortable, although people may complain about the comfort of the third row, it is usually only uses sometimes and by kids not adults. It can hold a decent amount of cargo. The electronics are pretty good, we got all of them. Over all, good car."
chrysler,pacifica,2007,prof, 03/19/2008,best mileage in a long time,5,"I have really enjoyed this vehicle.  The 4 liter engine and six-speed automatic make it absolute fun to drive.  I get about 16.7 mpg around town and 27.8 on the highway with A/C on and running at 70 mph.  The only vehicle I have owned that bettered it was a '79 VW Rabbit Diesel. (Except for that I've always driven large vehicles).  My special-ordered vehicle has HID lights which I love and backup camera with nav system which is also very nice. No moon roof which I hate. Mine also has dual exhausts.  The brake response is the best I've had in many years.  Likewise the steering. Throttle easily permits light, smooth getaways.  Good driver's position.  I also like the power liftgate."
chrysler,pacifica,2007,Bobby G, 03/21/2008,Very Happy So Far,5,The vehicle is perfect for family getaways.  Loads of room for everyone and everything!  Gas mileage is great on highway and there is plenty of horses for passing.
chrysler,pacifica,2007,mike, 04/01/2008,grreat suv,4,Just purchased my new car  and love it. The motor has plenty of power and you get a lot for your money. Can't understand why they would stop making them.  
chrysler,pacifica,2007,john, 04/12/2008,Not what I came for - but...,5,"We were in the market for a crossover type vehicle to replace our explorer - preferably used (after seeing the prices).  We narrowed it to the Edge, Mazda MX9, and the Nissan.  When we got to the lot, there was a Pacifica there - we decided to drive it since we had some time, but not really considering it as an option.  We loved it!! If you're looking at this style vehicle, you can't beat the drive and comfort of the Pacifica for thousands less (for a used vehicle).  Definitely an overlooked vehicle."
chrysler,pacifica,2007,trombone, 04/24/2008,Transmission,5,"If you buy one, be sure to ask or have the Torque converter checked because there have been many replaced (including mine) in this vehicle, which I found out after the fact.  The vehicle would start shuttering in the rear going up hills and they found out the TQ was the culprit.  A new one fixes it, but can be spendy if no warranty.  Otherwise its an awesome vehicle that I love driving!"
chrysler,pacifica,2007,Joseph, 04/25/2008,Luxury Bang for the Buck,4,"This is the 3rd Chrys we've owned and the best. We both are in our 50s and the ""step"" in & out is great.. performance, ride, comfort is purely Luxury. We got the Touring, with the Spring Special. Grandkids Love the 8 in DVD Screen. Love the styling and handling on the highway especially with the 19 in. wheels a Classy ""Car"". Chrysler needs to rethink doing away with this vehicle after 2009. VERY Underrated. What's a Chrysler Man do... "

"
chrysler,pacifica,2008,twistedtoes, 02/23/2014,Great driving experience!,5,"I, for the life of me can't understand why Chrysler stopped building such a great driving experience of the Pacifica. I'm totally amazed at how well this piece of equipment handles itself on the highway as well as in town. It's not sluggish when you want to pass another car and the fact that it's interfaced with Mercedes - Benz technology only adds to the driving experience. I just paid mine off, so the ride just got better!"
chrysler,pacifica,2008,Russ, 10/04/2010,Please start making the Pacifica again!,4,We bought a 2007 base model for our son to tour with his band and we had been looking for a late model Pacifica for a while ourselves.  A loaded Limited fell into our laps.  We could not have been more pleased.  Ride is great. Seats and all the adjustments and memory are required for us with me 6-4 and wife 5-4 although I don't give up the driving duties much.  It is our long distance car and I love to drive it.  Chrysler HAS to reintroduce this car!!
chrysler,pacifica,2008,jtg1961, 03/04/2009,Sad to see this baby go,4,"This is the second Chrysler Pacifica I've owned. I was happy with my 05 but wanted to upgrade to the 08 with 4.0L engine and 6 spd transmission. The difference with the extra power and smoother shifting is incredible. Too bad they didn't get it right initially but they have it right now, just in time to discontinue the line. What a shame, this is one of the best vehicles Chrysler has ever made. I bought one of the last of the 08 model year and hopefully it'll last a long time. The lifetime powertrain warranty should ensure that it does."
chrysler,pacifica,2008,chinatown, 10/26/2013,I was foolish enough to get rid of 2004...,5,"I had thought it was using oil. However, I later found out that it is normal with these cars as the lighter weight which improves the mileage is the reason.

Oh well.

Anyway an earlier post indicated the MP3 problem.
 I also experienced same. I later found this solution, after I had traded it in.

chrysler,pacifica,2008,Hunts, 08/06/2010,Love my Pacifica,4,"I own two Chryslers; one pacifica and one pt cruiser. I adore my pacifica so much. When we heard they weren't making them anymore we turned in our 2006 model for an upgraded Touring 2008. I can't even compare the two cars because they are so different. This is definitely my favorite car i have ever owned and love the comfort and feeling of safety traveling with my family. i hope it lasts forever, or they decide to start making them again. I wish both my cars were pacificas."
chrysler,pacifica,2008,cstrait37, 06/20/2008,"So far, so good.",4,"Got out of a lease on a 2005 Grand Cherokee (HEMI) and moved to more space, better MPG.  Got 0% 60 months and a GREAT deal because of edmunds.com  Wife loves the 6 sp tranny and the 4.0 L combined with the AWD.  Signature Series a MUST!  GREAT CAR!  Downside: Anyone in the CT area should NEVER deal with Action Motors of Danbury, CT.  Not enough space to explain all.  For instance got out of the Jeep (gave it to the dealer), 2 months later we get calls from a collection agency asking for the balance of $$$ owed on the Jeep.  Dealership never paid it off.  3 weeks and a LOT of phone calls later, it was taken care of. They are a MEAT MARKET.  You are just a number at Action Motors. Go elsewhere."
chrysler,pacifica,2008,Sandi, 05/26/2008,Safe & Beautiful,4,"We bought this car for its high safety rating.  We are tall people (5'9 6'3"") and can fit very comfortably in the front and second row seats.  The gas mileage we get is not very good.  This is our one disappointment.  The extras (which came standard on this model) are outstanding.  "
chrysler,pacifica,2008,Mark G, 11/19/2009,It Saved My Wife's Life,4,"My wife has driven 3 of these vehicles, 2004, 2006 and now the 2008 Touring W P Chrysler Edition.  The car is one of the safest vehicles on the road and it built like a tank with Mercedes technology.  My wife was rear ended (high speed)in a mulitiple car pile up on the freeway 5 months after getting the car and then hit a second time.  She walked away without a scratch or bruise and the car survived quite well !! Why stop building this car?  We would have bought them forever! Maybe decisions like this is why Chrysler went bankrupt. This car was heavily influenced by Daimler and was the best product to come out of their influence."
chrysler,pacifica,2008,Delores C Daundivier, 04/02/2008,Comfort Plus,4,This car is great for over 65 folks as it is comfortable and spacious. Very nice crossover. Room to travel long distances plenty of room for everything and easy on tired old bones
chrysler,pacifica,2008,Bob, 01/07/2010,A problem no one can fix,3,"When first starting my 2008 Pacifica, it sounds like the starter remains engaged with the flywheel for a few seconds. More so when cold than subsequent attempts. Starter replaced, problem not solved. Dealership is now saying the power steering fluid maybe thickening up due to the cold weather and the power steering maybe causing noise. Find this hard to believe for a car with less than 25k (or at all). Had other problems (tie rod, brakes, rattling noise in the interior) since purchasing vehicle with 18+k miles on it. Too many for a such a newer vehicle in my opinion."
chrysler,pacifica,2008,robrob1, 06/22/2011,Finally getting rid of it.,2,"Only the tip of the Iceberg. After 3,000 miles, they tried to fix the dreaded chronic transmission problems . (do a Google search).The sight of seeing the tranny in pieces from my new car made me regret my purchase instantly. They never really fixed the problem, so I was frustrated for 48 months. This car is also a MAJOR GAZ GUZZLER. In cold weather, the ''dual-exhaust'' system makes an unbelievable racket. Radio controls (and sound) are worthy of a '70's Corolla, cheap plastic and all. The idea for this car was right, but implementation was an unfinished nightmare. Too bad, it was full of promises. Pros: good ride, seats ok, roomy. Returning it next week, at long, long last. Good riddance."
chrysler,pacifica,2008,Yolanda English, 10/09/2010,Not recommended,2,"I bought my Pacifica for my birthday earlier this year. I was interested in it because I needed the 3rd row and was tired of being in a many van & I though it was cute. But having the 3rd row seat, it has no trunk room. You can't ride with the back windows down because of the noise the air pressure makes and it's a gas guzzler. I wouldn't recommend this car to my worst enemy. Also, when my batter died, I couldn't even turn the key to put the car in neutral to roll it back. To me, that's just not right. "
chrysler,pacifica,2008,Cliff Fortuno, 06/02/2018,Piece of junk,1,"The Pacifica is a piece of junk! The vehicle has had electrical problems where the dashboard lights first flicker, the radio goes static before finally the engine abruptly dies. It happens when driving in the freeway and in city roads. Replacing the transmission module, battery and cables as recommended by mechanics did not help at all. It is very unreliable. Besides that, the handling is like that of a school bus. The gas mileage is also pretty bad. I wouldn't buy a Chrysler product again.
"
chrysler,pacifica,2008,Ani, 11/04/2009,Touring 2009 Model,2,I have to post this here because there is no place to do the 2009. Our daughter bought the new 2009 Touring Model in January. She loved it at first but it has given her nothing but grief. Bad motor mounts. Transmission knocking and dealer says that is normal. One more thing also that I can't remember. She is so disgusted. In the garage again and again. 
chrysler,pacifica,2008,D, 10/05/2008,looks are deceiving,2,"Nice looking car, but it's only skin deep, interior is cheaply made, gas mileage is poor, lots of things missing that should be there like a glovebox light, ipod input, switches to shut of dome lights. The absolute worst car I ever bought. Tranny shifts hard, car starts roughly and stalls sometimes."
chrysler,pacifica,2008,Bob R., 06/07/2008,It's A Keeper!,4,"Quiet, solid, comfortable ride while driving. After test driving several mid-size SUV's (Toyota Highlander, Subaru Tribeca, Infiniti FX1, Suzuki XL, and the Veracruz), I settled on the Chrysler Pacifica.  I think this is an excellent automobile.  Chrysler should continue to produce it. It would be a shame to discontinue such a fine vehicle."
chrysler,pacifica,2008,Trail, 07/02/2008,"Satisfied, Great vehicle",4,"My first Chrysler and I feel we made the right choice, Great price with the features to match.

chrysler,pacifica,2008,2nd Pacifica, 01/08/2009,Great Crossover,4,I bought a 2004 Pacifica AWD when they came out.  Great crossover! My family and  I have driven all over the U.S. no problems. Lots of cargo space. Just traded in on a 2008 because of all that is on it unlike Ford/GM.  A lot for the money. Sorry that Chrysler is not going to continue building them.
chrysler,pacifica,2008,Retired, 03/12/2009,We love it,4,"Replaced a 2006 3.5 4 spd with this 2008 4.0 6 spd.  '06 had a transmission problem that could not be fixed before we had to travel.  What a difference. Must faster from the light, better milage on the highway but about the same mpg here in the Arkansas mountain community.  Did replace air filter with K&N and use synthetic oil.  Rides and drives better than any vehicle we have owned.  Can drive 800 miles a day with no problem.  Sorry they're going to discontinue.  Guess with the bumper to bumper lifetime warranty we'll drive it until it won't go."
chrysler,pacifica,2008,hmg, 03/30/2009,Investment,4,"Traded up from a GM product. This vehicle is fun to drive and the interior is great in the touring signature series. Chrysler can't fail with more cars at a good investment price and this stand behind bumper to bumper warranty coverage. No more pacificas, too bad. At least I got mine! Can't wait for a summer road trip."
chrysler,pacifica,2008,Vincent Black Shadow, 05/26/2009,Extremely Pleased,5,"Traded an 03 Town & Country that served us very well. Couldn't be more pleased with the Pacifica as a replacement. Refined and quiet, well done interior and great performance for a vehicle of this size. Haven't had it long enough to judge the fuel economy but I'm really not concerned. This is a very well made and well thought out car. Not to mention 30% off sticker from a dealer that was on the ""list"". "

We have LOVED it! Definitely an upgrade from our economy car before ;-) If you're looking for a car that's just the right size with lots of amenities, give the car a look.  *Disclaimer: Have only owned a few months, so I cannot attest to long-term reliability, but we are not worried about it ourselves."
chrysler,pacifica,2008,Stephen, 02/13/2008,Dream Machine,4,Wonderful automobile. Too bad Chrysler has ended production. Well designed interior and a first class ride. I've had many Chrysler products and this one is my favorite.

chrysler,pacifica,2008,Steve, 05/14/2008,Nice Car,4,"What a nice vehicle. Powerful comfortable. Just a treat to drive until you pass a gas station. I thought with the 6 speed transmission it would get halfway descent gas mileage. About 16 in the city, 27 or so on the road. (I'm sure I can do better on the highway). My 96 Grand Caravan did better in City driving. Overall this is a very nice car. I really like it!"

Misfitting dashboard, poor assembly, mismatched colors, really bad leather that appears fake in the way it wears and fades. We bought it new and the depreciation really hit hard. Sold it for penny's on the dollar! Avoid at all costs, it does not even belong in a rental car fleet! "
chrysler,pacifica,2008,Johnny, 05/21/2008,Very Junky Car,1,"The car may look nice but it is a piece of junk. I bought this thinking I got a steal but this has been the worst car I have ever driven. The brakes are very very bad, the acceleration is decent, the steering is not up to crossover standards. It's an overall piece of junk."
chrysler,pacifica,2008,Dianebkht, 01/17/2009,Great vehicle!,4,"Really nice vehicle, inside and out. The down side to the Pacifica is fuel usage. Drives great! Interior is protected, therefore making it easy to wipe off stains. Lots of space, no outside noise like the Town And Country I just traded in. Lots of leg room. Cargo is huge enough for a body (example people only) My Pacifica did not come with DVD so I will have one installed along with rims. I really got a great deal on my new Pacifica with me trading in a Chrysler. Now is the time to buy! Love the safety features as well! No bad experience at dealership nor with vehicle so far! "
chrysler,pacifica,2008,Brennen, 09/22/2009,Great Car! So Far...,5,"I absolutely love my Pacifica. I have the Signature Series with all the extras. Although I was worried that having so many power features could potentially mean expensive repair bills, this has not been an issue thus far. The Pacifica is extremely comfortable for four passengers, but it could have used a little more leg room in the third row. The seats are supportive, the the ride is smooth and quiet, and the engine and transmission perform well. I have had no problems at all with this car. I am extremely pleased my purchase."

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Ann M., 08/29/2016,Stylish and Modern some details need improvement,4,"I wish this minivan has all wheel drive. I don't drive my minivan in the snow as I live on a hill and it cannot navigate it. Otherwise,
Sleek Ride!  I feel like I am in my own private modern spaceship with beautiful dashboard - all cushy leather and modern controls.  It feels luxurious, spa-like.  I am just engulfed in massage!  Great 360 degree  camera - beeps on the side that you are about to bump into!  Rear camera is great because it also shows you your view from above.  The most fun is the SELF PARKING!  I love putting my hands high up in the air while the car PARKS ITSELF!  Then strangers come over to me and ooh and aah! This is great for NYC parking!!!   Here are the caveats:
1) NO SPARE TIRE -Chrysler swapped the interior space for spare tire for the vacuum system.  I bumped into a curb on a Sunday night - the inflator was not appropriate because tire had a large hole.  Needed a flatbed truck to tow it.  Now I have to wait THREE DAYS because dealer can't get tire . 2) the vacuum system is a great idea but they need to improve details.  Hose was not screwed down properly - so would not stay in place.  Dealer is having trouble screwing it down (in the trunk compartment) because of awkward positioning  Stowing the vacuum in the second seat side panel is not easy - this needs improvement. 3) seat stowage  - the old town and country was much better at this - not so easy and does not stow exactly flat or hidden 4)  the feature to kick and the door opens IS NOT AVAILABLE - false advertising

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Melissa, 09/14/2016,Limited model-Little disappointed,3,"I've had my Pacifica for now 2 weeks.  I got the limited model with sunroof.  First thing I notice is one of the screens on the UConnect is not working.  So dealership had to order another one.  The second disappointment is the noise coming from the roof.  It's very loud and annoying.  So I couldn't rate the noise level due to this.  Come to find out this is not the only sunroof problem this dealership has found with the Pacificas.  Hope they can figure out and fix this problem.  I would hate to know I've paid this much for a vehicle I can't enjoy driving due to this.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Will Nelms, 08/03/2016,Better than my Mercedes...,5,"19th Month update, car now has 18,700 miles, the due service light just came on for 2nd service.  To date, as complex and as many complicated electronics in this car, first of a new model and built very early in their release, I have had NO issues whatsoever.  Have only gone to the dealer for the first oil change and it was at no charge.  So very pleased with the quality.  Not much else to report other than I am very pleased with the car and its many features.  It is nice to be able to quickly lower all seats and have basically a cargo van that will hold 4 x 8 sheets of plywood.  I will say that I am very impressed with the AC, it cools extremely fast.

UPDATE-Owned car for 13 month-13,700 miles. Only to the dealer once for routine service, cost free.  Being a Limited with every electronic and an early build of a new model, I had thought I would have some issues but NONE! I found this to be a considerable upgrade from my Mercedes GL450.  The Chrysler is quieter, rides better, designed better, the front seats more comfortable & more leg room than the MB. One thing I don't like, the wheel tilts but does not telescope.  I am tall and like the seat all the way back, and would like to bring the steering wheel back towards me.  A minor gripe.  I bought the limited with every option. I was very pleasantly surprised by gas mileage.  I drive usually at 79 mph on the Interstate and the highway mileage was just under 28mpg.  The dash and electronics are laid our very well it is almost a full tablet. Be careful of dstraction.  I am most impressed by the radar cruise control.  I have had it on other cars but it was too abrupt and I would not use it.  Chrysler nailed it on this car.  I now use it almost every time I drive even in town. It works great in heavy stop and go traffic and you do not have to touch the brake or gas from 70 to zero and back to 70.    It has 3 settings, I have only used medium and it works perfect for me, smooth on stopping or starting and just about the right distance from the car in front of you.  Unlike another car, it does not sense the car next to you and make adjustments in error.  It also works well in the fast lane on the interstate, as the speed often in traffic flucuates +/- 10mph and you cannot use normal cruise control.  The car pegs it and made my long trips far less tiring. Anyone in the 2nd row loves the rear touch screen tablets.. We were driving in 100 degree heat and the car kept very cool very easy, the rear has pull down shades in addition to deep tint.  Another safety feature on the car, is lane assist, it will physically keep you in your lane in medium or high setting, but senses if you take your hands off the wheel. I assume they do not want one using it with radar cruise as the car would be driving itself.  I prefer the low or light setting, so I get a gentle nudge if driting out of my lane.  Even with the active system off,  the blind spot warning with a light on your mirror and an audible warning alerts you of a car in your blind spot and the lane assist nudges you to stay in your lane.   Another feature that impressed me, was the camera system.  You have the standard backup camera that can be switched into a 180 degree mode where you can see cars or people approaching from the side when backing.  It also has a front camera but what really impressed me was the 360 degree camera that gives you the view that you would see from a satellite looking down at your car. It is some type of virtual reality and even shows the color of the cars around you.  This car has the automatic parking system for both parallel parking and backing into a parking spot.  Both work well.  I have the upgraded stereo with 19 speakers, you could not get better sound.  Having all seats fold into the floor is a great feature. The limited comes with a huge sun roof, almost the entire roof of the car is glass. I do not use it
 and think it adds heat and would order without it. It also has roof rails that fold into the roof when not needed, making the car more air efficient and sleeker.  It comes with 3 high tech keys.  Each can be set for different drivers, you can even limit the speed of the car by programming the key. The Nav system is the best I have owned & with the Sat radio comes with live traffic updates and live weather radar and all kind of aps you can access from the car. This car has the vacuum and with it you give up the compact spare which imo is worthless anyway.  This car is designed  for road trips, I already bought a matching full size spare for when going out of town.  If I have a flat I want to change the tire and continue my trip, not be forced to try and find a matching tire.  If the spare takes up too much space, just buy a streamlined thule cargo box for the roof.  I think this is the best car I have owned and I have owned 100s literally.  I am a car nut and Chrysler hit a Grand Slam with this car. I like it better after a year and 3 long trips. A  Flawless car so far.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Scott, 11/30/2016,Excellent vehicle!,5,"I'm adding to my original review.  I've now owned my Limited for almost 34 months.  It continues to perform yeoman's duty as my daily driver to work, people transport to events, and ""stuff"" hauler on the weekends.  In the time since my first review I've replaced the tires, had regular oil changes according to the 10K intervals, replaced 2 windshields (irresponsible winter drivers), and completed a recall.  I changed out the 20"" OEM tires (you'll be lucky to get 30-35K) with Goodyear Assurance WeatherReady tires(20"").  So far no significant issues, no significant repairs etc etc.  I've never been out of service and continue to enjoy my Pacifica...which is about to turn 50,000 miles.  I noticed that a Pacifica aced the long term review (C/D?)  but is being reported as problematic in a more recent long term review.  As usual, I'm reminded of my first listserv/blog on Chrysler products back in the 90's where the original on-line ""trolls"" would report problems when they didn't even own a car.  While I believe it's possible...I find it unlikely that these catastrophic ""lemon's"" are actual owner's vehicles.  I've yet to find a local owner plagued by significant problems.   If you like it buy it!


I would start by suggesting that readers cast a critical eye toward some of these ""reviews""--their validity is questionable.  A few things I'd debunk.  First, I'm 6'3"" and have no trouble getting in and out or finding a comfortable driving position.  My Pacifica Limited is my work vehicle and I bought it party due to it's long haul comfort.  I find no lack of interior storage.  From the center console and door pockets to the glovebox and the empty Stow N Go compartments--there's considerable storage.  Someone suggested that there is no discernible difference between the new Pacifica and the former Town and Country.  Absolute rubbish--after spending considerable time in a previous gen van I can tell you that the differences are considerable.  You'll notice the same sentiment from professional automotive reviews as well.  I've accumulated just over 4000 miles in 2 months and performance, fuel economy and ride/handling are excellent.  I had questioned getting the 20"" wheel and tire package but am pleased with the appearance.  They also have no adverse effect on the ride/handling balance.  The seats are comfortable in any position and stow quickly when I need to haul materials over people.  Controls are fairly intuitive and my gas mileage has been respectable given my driving characteristics.  My dealership experience was solid, there have been no problems so far and I'd recommend anyone in the market consider driving a Pacifica.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Hate Toyota Stories, 06/17/2016,Only this could pry Mom away from her Sienna,5,"My wife loved her Sienna.  Me personally, I hated it but nothing ever broke except the automatic door shutter.  I can live with one thing broken on a 100k van used for a day care.  Anyway, I just didn't like it.  We sold it when we went overseas.  When we moved back to the states I got her to buy a Mazda5 for the fuel mileage.  Worked fine while we had 2 kids but when we had a 3rd kid it become close to worthless.  There's just no room in it.  Not only that, I had to put up with the constant drone of hearing how great the Sienna was.  ""The Sienna could do this and that and that better....  blah, blah, blah...""  It was like listening to fish stories.  The inside got bigger and it got even better gas mileage every time she talked about it.  So, we went to look for a minivan.  I was thinking Odyssey, she was insisting on Sienna.  On a whim we went to go look at a T&C, friend has the Dodge version and swears by it.  So off we go after looking at the Hondas and Toyotas all day.  And there it was.  I guess the dealer just got them in.  Never even knew what the Pacifica was.  Hadn't seen a commercial for it and I don't exactly look for vans or really even care.  Looked at a Limited.  Wife loved the sunroofs.  And the seats.  And the storage.  And pretty much everything about it.  Nice test drive.  Rode good, very quiet.
Went home that night and talked about our choices.  She was dead set on the Pacifica.  I about fell out of my chair.  After 7 years of listening to the Toyota hype she swapped brands.  2 weeks later I'm still shaking my head.
Anyway, we had them find what we wanted in the color we wanted.  Took them a day to have it transported to us.  We just wanted the safety package with the adaptive cruise and the tow package (and 220amp alternator).  I put 10 inch TV/DVD players in myself for $300 vs buying the entertainment package for $999.  We've only racked up 1000 miles but I actually love driving it.  It really is a great van and very well thought out.  It actually does get 28-29 on the highway at 70mph.  Didn't expect that.  And it is very quiet.  Very nice van and we're both really happy.  Looking forward to taking a trip in it.  Haven't heard a single damn Toyota fish story since we bought it.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,minivanman, 12/15/2016,The Ultimate Road-trip Machine,5,"This is by far the best van I’ve ever owned.  I opted for a fully-loaded Limited so it’s also the priciest.  I currently own a 2016 Odyssey and previously had a Chrysler TC and Kia Sedona.  
Drive:  Overall, the Pacifica handles very well.  It has the Advanced Safety Tec and the default settings for the lane departure are helpful without being obnoxious as is the adaptive cruise.  Leaving the park assist on can be annoying though because it sometimes beeps when stopping behind another vehicle at a red light or driving close to an ATM (you can quickly turn it off with the push of a button).  I expected the van to have a blind spot camera that would activate when changing lanes given the price range, but it does not—just the lights on the side view mirrors that light up like in my old TC.  I had to drive the van back from a 120 mile trip through snow storm and it handled well.  While driving in the white-out conditions, I wished it had AWD, but the Sienna is still the only one with that feature.  The snow covered the external sensors and the lane markers on the road so lane departure and adaptive cruise could not function.  A heating system for the sensors might be a good idea to deal with these issues.  The rear backup camera is low res—lower than my mid-trim Odyssey and when you’re paying a premium, you don’t want a fuzzy image.  The ride is fairly quiet, but I expected it to be quieter given how Chrysler touts the noise dampening features.  The unconventional gear shift knob is fine, but it stresses my wife out because she’s afraid that she might absentmindedly shift the car to park when trying to adjust the radio volume.    
Interior:   The interior is very comfortable with lots of storage throughout.  In my previous vans, I’d get annoyed when my wife reduced the center console to a counter for her massive purse.  The Pacifica addressed this with a space in front of the console big enough to accommodate a spare tire or her purse (but just barely).  The three glass panel roof is great and gives the already roomy van a very open feel.  I like being able to shift the second row seats up with car seats in place to allow easier access—especially for adults—to the third row.  A warning to morons like me, don’t try to shift the second row seat while your toddler is seated lest you meet the business end of the aforementioned massive purse.  It’s nice that the third row passengers have controls to recline the seats, but it would be nicer if both sides of the third row had USB charging ports.  I’m the last person to advocate for kids to have their faces in screens, but I’m even more opposed to hearing my kid piss in my ear about how it’s not fair that his sister can charge her device while he can’t.  Also, if you have the vacuum, that side of the third row has no cup holder (the other side has two).  Basically, the third row passenger sitting on the driver’s side gets screwed.  I like being able to kick under the sliding doors and tailgate to open them when my hands are full, but you can’t kick to close when you’re unloading your cargo/toddler.  The second row stow is the one thing I’m glad that was carried over from the earlier Chrysler vans.  I love using the compartments for extra storage when taking long road trips so the main cabin is less cluttered.   The lack of this feature made the hybrid version a nonstarter for me.     
Tech:  The nav system is ok if you’ve never used one, but the nav screen looks 10 years old.  I’ve always opted out of getting nav when I had a choice because I assumed it would be inferior to Google Maps or Waze on my phone.  The Pacifica’s nav only confirmed that practice.  Otherwise, the UConnect Infotainment system is very good.  It’s fairly intuitive and takes a few minutes of playing around to figure out how to control everything.  It would be nice if the theater allowed you to play two different DVDs on
 the two screens, but that’s not too big a deal.  I like being able to play movies off a USB drive that plugs into a port next to the DVD player.  You can play different movies off the same USB on the two screens.  mp4 format does not appear to be supported, but it plays avi files fine.  I was able to use my Roku mini (both screens have a usb for charging and HDMI ports) to watch streaming content by tethering to my phone.  I believe you can pay extra to have the van itself serve as a wireless hotspot, but it’s only 3G.  I ordered an HDMI lightning cable for my iPhone and will see if I can mirror to the second row screens.  
Bottom Line:  While it may seem like I’m critical in pointing out deficiencies in the Pacifica, I am extremely pleased with it and have no regrets (so far).   I got this van to do more road trips with my family and I am certain that we will travel in more comfort and have more fun than in any other minivan on the market.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Jaypoocha, 08/15/2016,"3,985 Miles in two weeks! My Pacific Impressions",4,"Overall, the 2017 Pacifica Limited with all major options is a wonderful minivan. I traded my 2014 Honda Odyssey Elite for 2.5 weeks ago for the Pacifica. The Pacifica excels in the following areas: 1. Front Passenger Seat Comfort is incredible with the 8 way power and lumbar support  2. Quiet cabin on the highway in comparison to my previous minivan  3. Great upgraded audio system  4. Great cabin visibility  5. The ACC - the adaptive cruise control works without flaw, except when changing lanes it attempts to break when not needed until it fully clears the lane  6. The dashboard cluster is very nicely designed and aesthetically pleasing  7. The stow-and-go seats are incredibly easy to use and stow. I love this feature on the Pacifica. 8. The electrically adjustable 3rd row seat is a winner for my kids on long trips for comfort!  9. Incredible fuel economy on the highway of 25.5 Mpg driving approximately 80 mph. and 10. The upgraded wheels on the limited are beautiful.  Since we purchased the Pacifica 2.5 weeks ago I have driven 3,985 miles!!! During this period I have discovered the following issues: 1. The FCW (forward collision warning system) does not function. I have received only one warning during the first 3,985 miles. In comparison, I received numerous per day on my previous minivan. I am thinking the system is either poorly designed or defective. I have a service appointment to evaluate this issue. I am hoping they have a quick fix for this critical safety feature since it is the primary reason I opted for the expensive safety package 2. I am unable to register my apps via the U-Connect App store. 3. The 3g installed is obviously an oversight for a car manufactured in 2017! Come on Chrysler, please step up to 4G/LTE! 4. The third row does not come with a floor mat! Any car with a MSRP of $50,250 should have a floor mat in every row. 5. The HID lights are incredible, but the high beams seem dim. 6. The upgraded video package forgot about the third row occupants by not offering a video screen and/or screens in this row. 7. The armrests have two positions, up or down, they can't be adjusted. All-in-all, this is a wonderful mini-van. The Pacifica, in my opinion, is probably the most stylish and comfortable minivan currently available on the market. I was able to purchase it for $42,499 after rebates and dealer discounts. If you shop around you should be able to get a great deal on the Pacifica Limited.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Tommy, 05/11/2016,Great Minivan,5,"Had a Town & Country, this is so much better. It is so much easier to get in and out of. We just got back from a 500 mile trip and it rode great, wind noise was non existent. It also does not look like a minivan, they did a great job on styling inside and out.

The only complaint I have is that the radio is always on. There is a mute button to silence it, however when you restart the vehicle the radio will blast you out unless you turned the volume down before turning off the van. They say it is just the type of radio, seems stupid too me.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Anonymous, 06/25/2016,Initial experience is quite nice,5,"We are driving this care for a month now, had a Sienna before and temporarily a Kia Sedona for comparison. It offers a nice, convenient ride, modern look, good accessibility and view from the driver's seat. We have the bigger LCD display and the rear camera is excellent. Rear cross traffic alert and blind spot warning work very well. The nine speed transmission doesn't allow manual intervention, but it is programmed well and has been working fine under all conditions so far. Gas mileage on highways is better than with previous minivans, in the city/suburbs the same. Overall we can recommend it as a stylish family shuttle that is sufficiently fun to drive.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Eddie K, 09/19/2016,Excellent Minivan with a few quirks..,5,"I have owned several Honda Odysseys over the last 9 years and coming straight from a 2014 Odyssey to the Pacifica is a genuine pleasure. The ride is sooo much quieter. The handling is actually great for a minivan. The engine and transmission are fantastic - very smooth and has tons of pickup when you put your foot down. Very very comfortable inside and the styling is 2nd to none. The kids LOVE this car. They prefer it over my wifes' Audi Q5 for the space, comfort and technology. Some very minor gripes...... It's not possible to enter a destination into the NAV when the car is moving and thats just ridiculous. You have to stop driving before using the NAV. Forget it. Use Waze. Chrysler - why can't my passenger enter a destination?  There are a few other strange bugs in the system.. Listen to XM with your phone charging via USB and then select NAV/Climate and the system transfers the audio so that i plays through your phone speakers. Meaning you have to then pickup and unlock your phone to stop it playing. I also cannot turn off the 2nd row heated seats from the front console for some bizarre reason. BUT dont let these minor issues stop you from owning what is an excellent vehicle.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Floyd Sense, 06/19/2017,A real surprise!,4,"I traded my 2016 Honda Odyssey EX for this second-hand 2017 Pacifica.  The primary reason was the poor human factors in the Odyssey interior design.  For example, if you wear polarized sunglasses and live in a sunny climate, you can't read the speedometer in the Odyssey - white numbers on a bright metallic background.  And, my 5'2"" wife could never find a comfortable driving position.  The rear lift gate was difficult for a short person to open and close.  The Pacifica has none of these problems and clearly Chrysler spent considerable time with the interior design and came up with a winner.  The dashboard design is just about perfect - the large screen is tilted towards the driver so as to be very easy to read and all the control knobs/buttons are easily reachable by the driver.  The controls are all logical and well laid out.  The navigation system is the best I've seen and is the first I've used that is better than my stand-alone Garmin GPS.  Destinations can be entered by voice and the system does a great job on interpreting what I say.  In addition, you can control the radio and other systems via voice commands.  The center storage bin assembly is very well thought out and provides a convenient place to store a purse or box of tissues so that it doesn't roll around when cornering.  There's even an additional USB port for charging phones, etc.  The rear lift gate has a power assist that raises and lowers the gate with an accompanying beaping tone.  The stow and go middle seats are fairly easy to store and when they're raised and in place, you can use their storage compartments to store other items.  The seats do not seem to be as comfortable as the second row seats were in my Odyssey, but they may be perfectly adequate - just haven't tried them on a long trip yet.  Shorter members of the family say they're just fine, but they seemed a bit low to me.  On the other hand, the third row seats are a bit deeper and seemed to be more comfortable than those in the Odyssey.  The biggest surprise for me was the gas mileage.  On the 128 mile trip home from the dealership, we got an overall 30.6 mpg average and that included the 2,000 foot climb up the mountain near home.  Over the first 115 miles, we saw 33 mpg over rolling hills at 70 mph.  Over the same route, the Odyssey usually averaged 26-27 mpg, never exceeding 28 mpg.  The new 9 speed transmission is as smooth as a CVT, but without the noise.  Braking response is more positive than that of the Odyssey, i.e., braking begins higher on the pedal with slightly more resistance.  The only negative I've seen thus far is the windshield mounted rear view mirror.  It gives a somewhat closed-in view to the rear.  We live in the mountains with very few straight and level roads and the Pacifica handles every bit as well as the Odyssey did.  There's very little body roll and you're never reminded of the large metal structure behind you.  If you're considering an Odyssey, please go drive the Pacifica before making the decision.  Hopefully, the Pacifica reliability over the long haul will be the same or better than the Honda.

Addendum: Some models do not come with a spare tire, just one of the slime patch kits and a pump.  You can add a donut spare (it comes un-inflated) in which case it's stored in the compartment in the far rear on the left side.  Without the spare, there are two smaller compartments, so when you buy the spare you'll want to buy the new panel that covers the spare storage area as well.  These items are not inexpensive, so it's a good idea to try and get the dealer to throw in the spare and panel if the model you want doesn't come with it.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,L Blair, 09/01/2016,"Best I ever owned, beats Honda, Toyota, easily.",5,"My 2017 Chrysler Pacifica LX, with the rebates and discounts (not offered with Honda or Toyota), was thousands less than either Honda or Toyota.  I paid 25,500 for the base model which is many thousands less than any other minivan except the Grand Caravan.   Its the quietest riding car ever.  Gas mileage is better than advertised by about 3 miles per gallon, as I consistently get 32 mpg on the hiway, and 27 combined city and hiway.   I had a 2014 Chrysler Town and Country, which was also a great van, but this is better as it gets much better gas mileage, is quieter, turns shorter and easier to handle.   The stow and go, not available on Honda, or Toyota, makes it the most versatile van ever.  I can use it to haul cargo or up to 7 people, or any combination of both.   The Pacifica rides quieter and smoother, gets better mileage, is more versatile, Turns shorter and handles better,  and even  costs less than Honda or Toyota, as I test drove these before buying the Pacifica.     I dont know if it will hold the resale value well yet, but someone thinks so as I leased mine for way less than a Toyota or Honda.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,david, 12/19/2018,World's highest mileage 2017 Pacifica,4,"Stranded in Hilton Head Ilsand on vacation, I rented a '17 Pacifica to get me, my gf and our two bikes and two kayaks home to Pittsburgh. I have a bad back and after the 700 miles trip (mostly at 80-90 because, even with kayaks on the roof, it felt like 60), my back was NOT SORE!! So, I bought one to use primarily for my job delivering auto parts to remote areas in western PA. (Sorry this site doesn't do paragraphs)... 

I drive 500 miles a day and now, as of end of 2018, I have over 227,000 miles on mine. Zero problems with engine -- even same spark plugs. I just had my first repair; the front drivers side wheel bearing went bad... At 10k miles, the electrical system started acting up occasionally; speaker making buzzing noise occasionally, back up camera not working 10% of the time, drivers window occasionally would go back down after you closed it and USB not working 15% of time (AHH, NO PODCASTS!!!!!). But all of the issues have self healed except for USB (tried many different brands)... 

At 182k the transmission started hard shifting which is a somewhat common issue. About 3-5% of the time between 2nd and 3rd gear the van would jerk equivalent to someone rear ending you at 5mph. So, really hard for a transmission!!... transmission shop said failure was imminent (paraphrasing, obviously;). But I figured out that if I accel briskly from 0-15mph, or really slowly, it doesn't happen. So here I am 45k later at 227k and it's only gotten a little worse... the dealer said the trans fluid is 'lifetime' and so wouldn't change it. This is, of course only true if lifetime = less than 100k miles. At 140k it started humming just before up shifting around 45-50mph. So, perhaps, had I had the oil changed at 50k for the first time, not 140k, perhaps I wouldn't be having a line pressure issue as I am. To change you need to; remove the drivers side front wheel, remove plug, siphon about 6.25 quarts out, refill with Mopar 9 speed ATF which is about $50 a quart at the dealership and $25 on Rockauto.com, you have to buy a $25 special dip stick to make sure... in all I'm so far happy with the van despite the, ah, quirks. Looking at a quarter million miles with only one wheel bearing as an actual repair and, of course oil, trans and tire changes is pretty good. The mileage is still consistently in the high 20's and I do tow a Bayliner 175 about 4k miles a year (boat and trailer 2500lbs). The infotainment system on the base LX is terrible. My 2012 civic LX was light years ahead. But, it's a mini van that's fast and super comfy to sit in and, I paid $23,500 and saw some 2019's for closer to 22! So, that said, it's a fine vehicle and not the ugliest mini van out there. -C'est la vie.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Thomas Aiken, 05/31/2017,Transmission almost killed my family twice...!!!,1,"We were on a trip to Tennessee from SC and we were on a mountain road in a pull off.   I put it in reverse and it went wild.   All the lights came on, transmission locked up, parking brake lit up and transmission did not work.   15 minutes of turning the car on and off finally reset it.   Drove home with no problems.   Couple weeks later my wife called me crying hysterically that she and our three young daughters were almost killed because she was driving on a busy road and the transmission locked up.   We limped the car into the dealership and 2.5 weeks later (4,600 miles) we were given the van back and told it was fixed and safe.   Last week I was driving my wife on a busy 55 mph road with my son and his wife behind us.   The transmission locked up and we went from 55 to 20 in 2 seconds and all the lights came on and locked up and I limped it into a pull off.   If it was an 18 wheeler behind us, we would have died right there.   We have now told Chrysler that there is nothing they could do to make me feel safe to put my family into ANY Pacifica.   They are now fighting us to give us our money back.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Jan West, 09/13/2016,Minivan Paradise!,5,"We absolutely love this minivan!  We've only had it about a month, so questions about maintenance costs and resale value are not applicable.  Regarding gas mileage, this vehicle had the highest of any of the vans we saw at 28 on the road.  The moon roof is awesome because it goes the full length of the car.  The most outstanding feature is the way the seats fold down into the floor of the car--so ingenious!  The roof rack tucks in--a lever opens it up when needed.  I think this is a streamline feature that will save gas mileage.  The amount I entered for the price is the advertised price we paid, without sales tax, other fees, and extended warranty.  The car, inside and out, is beautiful!  It is so easy to drive and very comfortable.  It will take us awhile to learn and use all the features this car has to offer.  It seems like the engineers thought of everything!

Update:  We have owned the minivan now just over 6 months.  We still think this is an amazing vehicle!  We could add that we wished there was more hanging space for clothing.  We bought some hooks that clip onto the headrest posts of the front seats that you access behind the front seats and this helps.  Also, we noticed that the speed control does not maintain the set speed when going downhill sometimes.  If I lower the speed by one mile, it seems to hold the speed in check better.  We bought rubber mats online to protect the interior carpeting. This is such an easy driving, comfortable ride!  We are planning to take it camping this summer and are looking forward to sleeping inside with the moon roof open.  We are happy to own such a luxurious vehicle!

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Sree, 11/29/2016,Do you believe this about PACIFICA TOU L PLUS?,1,"I bought a brand new PACIFICA TOURING L PLUS 2017 and drove couple of miles I found few issues. 1. 3rd row power stow and go had a problem. 2. When I was trying to reverse the car, it was stuck and not able to move back. 3. 2nd Day, it stuck middle of the road and completely stopped the engine. ""Driving"" mode came back to ""Parking"" mode and engine completely stopped. Didn't start almost 30 minutes. After that it started again. 4. After towing the car to the dealer's place on Sunday, next day which is on Monday, Technician drove the car to reproduce the issue. While he was driving, ""Driving"" mode came back to ""Parking"" mode and engine completely stopped. I did return the car to the dealer. It was really scary. Life and death issue. Thank god It' was not on the highway.  Again, I really like this Pacifica 2017 minivan but wanted to hear your experience. Please let me know if you run into similar issue.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Bill, 07/13/2016,3 Year Anniversary! And Still Lovin It,5,"OK, my wife and I are finicky about our favorite cars/vans to drive, for leisure or for work. She has a 2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee, I drove a Camaro most of the time.  We stopped at our local Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram dealership, for an oil change in the Jeep. So we are walking casually in the showroom, when we see this beautiful red color on a minivan, SUV? We both go towards it and say ""What the #@$$ is this!"" Dealership owner is walking by, he says ""good morning"" as do we, then my wife asked if it was unlocked, and if we could look inside? He says, sure! do what ever you would like to. So we did. My wife's wheels were already turning inside her head, and I was floored by the concept and features on this rather large vehicle. We were both experiencing something that seldom happens in our 32 years we've been married. We agreed on the spot, ""This is our next vehicle!"" The one on the showroom floor was a Limited model in the Red Pearl coat finish. We haggled a price with a nice salesman. looked again at each other, and said "" No, that's too much."" Salesman says there are two other models both in red pearl coat. We got outside saw the Touring model, and only noticed a couple of small details, the other had, and this one did not. What it did have, was 95% of the other options of the more expensive model. Great! Took it on a 15 minute test drive, came back, haggled a bit, got the price we wanted. We spent 5 hours total at the dealership, and bought a new Pacifica. We've had it for 5 days now, and loving it more each day. I have Parkinson's, and other health issues, my Mother is 82. My wheelchair and supplies fit in a few different places inside, while leaving plenty of room for 4 or 5 passengers. I can get out easier, as well as my Mother can get out without any assistance. Looking forward to many family functions out of town, now that we can ride/drive in comfort. 
Well we have spent one full year in our 2017 Pacifica. Going over the things I commented on in previous post. I stand behind them a year later. It has made several trips to WVU Morgantown WV. The comfort and styling still feel new ,(in a good way). We feel confident with our decision to buy. Definitely the right automobile for us!
Time sure flies. 2018 already. OK right to it, the bad. Really would have liked the option of driver seat memory, in the touring model. Being able to adjust the seat 9 ways is ok for one driver, but not two or more. Recalls=2!. Turns out they are both pre-emptive fixes. Glad it's not an emergency, or safety issue. The good. We hit the 10,000 mile mark in December 2017. Still feels new in many positive ways. Looking forward into 2018, and putting the next 10,000 on it.
July17 2018. We have been in the Pacifica for 2 years now. Wow, 17,000 miles, been to the dealer's garage for oil change and checkup. All good, still loving it overall. If this Chrysler model were offered in AWD, we would jump on it, and let go of our 2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee.
January 2019.... Time flies, and our Pacifica too ! Alright, the good to great; Ride is still smooth, paint is holding up well through 2 1/2 years of driving on her. Has gone into daily driving, no longer the weekender automobile. We sold our 2006 Jeep G CHK this past summer. So the Pacifica is the main mode of transportation. It's been a light-weight winter, weather-wise, that being so, the Pacifica has performed very well on snow, and ice.
Now the Cons; The memory option for the front seats, or the driver-side 9 way seat controls. In my consumer opinion, these options should be standard equipment for all models of the Pacifica !  I'm 6'2"", and my wife is 5'3"". Adjusting the seat with the 9-way electronic controls is both time consuming, and frustrating. Let's face it, you are not going to set the seat at your optimum settings every time you get in to drive. Full control electronic adjustment  WITH memory
 settings should be in BOTH front seats.
2019 models out, lotza talk about the hybrid. Will we see an AWD Pacifica by 2020? Probably not. The Pacifica we have, has done well in the snow, and winter mix. Still, we live in the Upper Ohio River Valley, and many locations, and some entire building additions, in our city have us on treacherous one way up, one way down access to these areas. AWD, and 4 x 4 are a necessary.
07/18/2019, 3 years now! Wow, The ride is still great, interior and exterior holding up well. There have been 4 total recalls, ranging from computer updates to actual replacement of suspect parts. Sounds worse than it has been. Our service center at the purchased from dealership is always a comfortable, stress free environment. They are courteous, and professional. Keep you updated on the service they are performing.  They have flex-able hours that make getting service appointments easier to make. Every employee you encounter smiles when they greet you, and nobody tries to pressure you if your checking out the showroom floor. The PROS are still pretty amazing. 2020 AWD?

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Patrick, 06/02/2017,Problems in the first week,3,"So, we were super excited about this car (or as excited as one can get about a minivan), and as other people mentioned, it shows really well and has some great features, but 1 week in (that's right, just 1 week) we've already having issues. Picked up the car on Monday; Tuesday it was in the service shop because the TV's didn't work; Wednesday/Thursday was happy with the car; Friday I'm making another service appointment because the rear/trunk liftgate no longer functions. Rating as 3 stars (for now), but anymore issues and I'll lower it to 2 or 1 star. Trying to be patient - but we'll see how long that lasts.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,pk, 11/06/2016,We love it!,5,"We've had the Limited Pacifica for about 6 weeks and have put about 3,000 miles and we all love it!   The front seats are super comfortable and feels like a luxury car.   Both my husband and I love the drive.  The van feels very solid, no rattling at all.  We did a very extended test drive on our van to make sure of this because of some of the reviews I've read.  No issues.   I would agree that the second row seats are not quite as comfortable the Honda or the Toyota.  Our kids don't seem to notice or mind and we love the stow and go option.  That was a huge factor for us and I have used it multiple times.   Actually our kids like the middle row stowed and sit in the 3rd row.   I've seen multiple folks mention the lack of 3rd row TV's.   Every kid can see a screen.  Also there are USB jacks in the rear for iPads, you could always but iPad/kindle holders behind each seat if you wanted.   We love they van!

Super comfortable, easy to drive, good on gas, and...dare I say...even a bit sporty in the curves. Pretty good looking too! Very pleased!

Update 3-17, After 5,000 miles and winter I can say....I'm getting 30mpg on the highway or a bit more and it's decent in the snow too. Still loving it!

Update 9-29-17, Have driven about 11,000 miles with a lifetime mileage of just over 28 mpg, haven't had any problems so far, looks and drives like new.

Update 3-29-18, Right at 20,000 miles and still loving this van. Today I drove from Rockford IL to Chicago and back and averaged a whopping 32mpg. Oil has been changed twice and a couple of updates to the software at the dealer, no problems of any kind.

Update 10-2-18, Have 27,000 miles on it, still zero problems, lifetime mileage 27.7mpg

Update 4-3-19, Have about 35,000 on it now, still zero problems and getting excellent mileage. It came with 17"" wheels but I put some 20"" aftermarket wheels on that really dress it up.

Update 10-3-19 44,000 miles and sitting on about 27mpg lifetime, still zero problems. I've managed to curb rash all 4 of my aftermarket wheels but....they still look pretty good. Continue to be super happy with this van!

Update 4-3-2020 The van continues to be trouble free and getting good mileage. Still running and looking like new. Am at about 51,000 miles now, still very pleased.

Update 10-3-2020 Still trouble free and looking good, over 60,000 miles now.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Steve Erickson, 10/30/2016,A cross country delight!,5,"We have had our Pacifica for about five weeks. We ordered our Pacifica early last summer. Shortly after it arrived in late Sept. we drove it from our home in Northern MN to SW FL. We now have almost 4,000 miles  on our Pacifica. It has been several years since we have owned a van the last of which was a 2004 Honda. We could not be more impressed with our new van. We averaged between 28 and 30 mpg on our trip to FL often driving into headwinds at freeway speeds. We paid extra for the safety tech pkg, which provides blind spot monitoring, adaptive cruise control and lane departure monitoring all of which are great safety aids. The Pentastar V6 with the nine speed automatic work flawlessly providing great performance as well as outstanding fuel economy. This vehicle is very smooth and quiet. It has a very solid feel with no rattles or vibrations and handles surprisingly well for a van. The seating position for the driver is outstanding providing a great view of the road. The Uconnect technology system is very intuitive and easy to use. The stow and go seats are an engineering marvel. They are very easy to use and make the Pacifica a very capable vehicle. The hands free doors and tailgate are an added bonus. We expect to own our Pacifica for many years. In recent years we have owned Two Lexus RX 350's, a Honda van and two Jeep Grand Cherokees. While I know some people have questioned the quality of Chrysler products our experience is they are as good or better than the other brands we have owned. If you are in the market for a van or full size SUV you owe it to yourself to test drive the Pacifica. You won't be disappointed.

We have added 15,000 miles since we posted the original comments on our Pacifica. All that I would add is we have had no problems in the first year of ownership of our Pacifica. We now have other friends that have bought Pacificas. Everyone seems happy with their choice.

Our Pacifica now has 36,000 miles. It has been trouble free and enjoyable to drive. We are getting a small amount of tire noise as the tires approach the end of their useful life. I will be replacing the original equipment tires in another 5-10,000 miles.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Tony T, 11/02/2016,What a minivan!!!!,4,"I currently own a 2008 Sienna XLE and always loved it.  I just returned from a 6-day family trip.  We rented a Pacifica and drove it (I think it was a Touring-L model) for about 600 miles.  I got to say Chrysler did a very good job on this van.   The ride was very comfortable and so is the driver's seat.  The handling felt like a sedan rather than a minivan.  The UConnect system was very easy to use.  I figured it out in minutes after getting the minivan.  The interior was very quiet.  After we came back from the trip and drove our Sienna home from the airport, my wife immediately complained about the road noise in the Sienna.  Overall, I really enjoyed driving the Pacifica.  I would only consider buying and Odyssey or Sienna before, but this van will definitely be on my shopping list when I am ready to buy a new minivan.  Anyone is in the market for a minivan should at least take a test drive in the Pacifica.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Abraham Miller, 12/07/2016,Pacifica Update after a year.,4,"The driver seat height adjustment was deficient for short people (needed a cushion). Required an expensive after market window tinting because of glare, and heat through all windows. Dealer charge for tinting windows excessive (got the tinting done at less than half the dealers charge). Never needed such a tint on my trade in 2006 Dodge Grand Caravan SXT, and neither was there any problem with the driver seat height adjustment on latter vehicle.  I went thru USAA for an extended warantee which was half the price that the dealership offered. I somehow feel the dealership has no interest in accommodating me, because I paid cash.

After one year, I am overall happy with our 2017 Pacifica except for one issue which is quite annoying, but not critical.

Recently, I noticed a parking sensor problem issued on my dashboard.

When I brought the car into the dealership, they said that one of the four sensor on the rear bumper was defective, and was probably caused by a rear end collision, and it would not be covered  by the 3 year warrantee, and  it would cost me over $400 to replace.

 Since there was no noticeable damage to the rear bumper, I disputed their diagnoses to no avail.   

Needless to say, I still feel  the dealership should have taken responsibility for this repair, but I have no intention to handle this replacement on my own, and therefore, I intend to just live with this problem, which doesn't seem to have degraded the performance of this vehicle in any way.
 
This is an update on this vehicle as of 12 June 2018.

Currently this vehicle is getting very little use as my wife suffered a stroke back in February of this year, and she was the primary user of this vehicle; however, I will be taking the vehicle in to the dealership to address for a second time the rear sensor problem, and see, if they are willing to fix the problem under the existing warrantee coverage.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Jennifer, 06/27/2018,Expect a lot of repairs,2,"What a huge disappointment this van was.  Let me state upfront I loved the pacifica’s styling and features.  It’s a beautiful vehicle.  All the interior controls are well thought out.  I loved the one touch button to move up the drivers seat, which assisted in getting the kids in and out quickly.  Stow and Go Seats cannot be beat.  However, I had my van in the shop more times in the under 2 years I owned it than I had all my previous vehicles in the shop, Combined! Every time I brought it in was a whole day lost, and I had to remove out three car seats and reinstall them in a loaner (if I got one) or just go without car for the day.  I had problems with electronics, transmission, doors, and more.  The vehicle does not shift properly.  It fails to shift up a few times a week and just gets very high rpms and then brakes weird when this happens.  The dealer cannot figure it out.  This really disturbed me because we were 20,000 away from the transmission warranty being gone too.  20,000 miles is about one year for our family.    I cannot even remember all the problems I had.  I know the service manager by name and he knows me.  This is not good or desirable.  I finally decided to cut my losses.  Just after my initial warranty ended, I of course had my first repair to pay for out of pocket at about 37,000 miles.  We looked into the lifetime warranty at this point through Chrysler, as it was clear to us that it would be needed.  The cost was $4,500 plus $100 deductible for each repair.  We decided not to throw more good money after bad.  I traded it in for a 2018 Honda Odyssey and am so happy!!!!  Will never ever buy another Chrysler Jeep Dodge vehicle.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Oculos, 10/02/2016,climate control fail,4,"I have had the car for one day. The panel vent mode on the climate control worked on the first drive, but is now inoperative. Foot well and defrost work fine but the panel vent mode is dead. Update to follow after I go to the dealer Monday, tomorrow. And the ""kick to open"" side doors and lift gate are only working about one out of ten tries. I'm doing exactly as the manual instructs so I don't think it's user error. In less than 24 hours I'm having more issues with this car than I have had in the last 11 years with my Lexus LX... I hope it's just a couple minor glitches.

One Year Update: I had a fuel pressure sensor fail and left the car at the shop for two days to get that fixed, no charge. My UConnect display sometimes freezes while playing music, and continues to display the same artist and song while the entire playlist just keeps playing along. The cruise control allows the car to speed up as much as 10 MPH faster than the setpoint on a downhill. That's ticket territory. On my Lexus, the cruise control holds rock steady uphill, downhill or sidehill! The ""kick to open"" seems to be working better. The premium audio system is not that premium. It seems like the frequency response is off. Music you are VERY familiar with seems like half the tonal nuance is missing. My Lexus sound system is head and shoulders above this product, it's frankly shocking how good it is for a car. Well this is a $40K car, not an $80K car so I guess the value for money is fine. I like the ventilated seats for our hot Texas summers. I like the auto set parking brake when you park the car. You can also set the parking brake while stopped and in gear, and it will release itself automatically when you step on the gas. The side traffic warning lights in the side view mirrors are handy. The back up camera is miles better than on my Lexus. These are things lots of new cars have, not specific to Pacifica, that my 12 year old Lexus does not have. So I guess a lot of what I like about it is the newness of it...And 25MPG beats the hell out of 14.7 that my LX470 gets! Overall I like it a lot, with a few little annoyances. There have been no recalls or major points of failure. We bought it strictly for the Stow and Go seating. Once you stow the seats in the floor, you can fit a ridiculous amount of cargo back there. Including 4x8 sheet goods flat on the floor!!! THAT is utility, and no other minivan has this capability. As well it has a low sill, so lifting debilitated 90 pound dogs through the big cargo doors is a LOT easier than other cars. That is huge for us. So I give it a B plus or even an A minus overall. Stay tuned for the next update...
Update 10-18-18: 35, 000 miles. There have been several recalls and service bulletins for the cruise control, the main computer, the outside temperature gauge, and a few other problems. I have to drop the car off at the dealer and get a ride from someone, not too convenient. So this car is far less reliable than a Toyota/ Lexus product, but all the problems have been fixed under warranty. But, once the warranty is out, I expect to be paying for some repairs. I am willing to put up with this for the value of the Stow and Go seating. If you don't care about having a huge flat stowage space that can accommodate 4x8 sheet goods flat on the floor, you might want a Toyota or Honda van. I'm sticking with this one for now.

After the first service, the Van would not start intermittently. Every morning is like tossing a coin if for start. I have taken this car 6 times to the Dealer in past 4 months and is there for most of the time. Every time the dealer says the problem is fixed, I'd have the same problem in next 2 or 3 days. Dealership would not take responsibility and neither Chrysler would take responsibility. Chrysler would come back and say they'd take some action based on their discretion at some point in future. My Pacifica 2017 seems to be a good case for a LEMON. I am currently checking if I can invoke Lemon Law.  Wish you good luck if you are deciding to buy this Mini-van.

Deal breaker is the front seat, I am 5'2"" and I have attempted to adjust the seat 100's of times and it doesn't work for me. I have bought 2 different cushions trying to pad the seats, thus far not working. I am in the process of having the front driver seat modified at an upholstering company. The bottom cushion is like seating on a metal bleacher seat. This was not identified on the 10-15 min test drive. However, the first time I drove 45 minutes I was in tears and knew that I can not drive this van. The dealership has been extremely supportive and trying to work with me. When I asked has anyone else complained about the seat and of course the answer was ""NO"". My seats are leather, have the cooling and heating units and was told due to the cooling there is an extra metal plate in the bottom of the seats. I also have the entertainment center in the back of each front seat.  I did sit in a friend's van that has cloth seats and no heating, cooling or entertainment center and they were more comfortable than mine.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,CSB, 02/07/2017,Cross Country Ride,4,"We bought our 2017 Chrysler Pacifica on May 5, 2016 from the Baumann Auto Group store in Fremont, Ohio.  We bought the Touring L model.
On August 1, 2016, we took a ”shake-down” trip to Denver, Colorado, driving from Tiffin, Ohio to Denver, a trip of about 1200 miles on the interstate.  On the trip west we averaged 70 miles an hour and averaged 32 miles per gallons.  While there we drove up to the Trail Ridge Road in the Rocky Mountain National Park and experienced no difficulties with the car.
On our return home trip drove 75 miles per hour and the mileage dropped to 29 mpg.
In November of 2016, we drove to Florida and again never experienced any problems.
We were very pleased with the performance of the car.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Amy, 03/20/2017,Changing review to read - DO NOT BUY!,1,"I loved my van - it drives great and handles great BUT service SUCKS!  I have had electrical issues for my van for months - rear door on driver's side will not shut and lights flicker throughout the van.  Has been in the shop since 11/28.  Chrysler Corporate won't even return my calls.  This vehicle is a lemon and I hope to have it declared that soon.  I am really wishing I had bought a Honda or Toyota - honestly anything but a Chrysler.  I read negative reviews before I bought this van, but wanted to give Chrysler a chance.  I love this van, but am done with it and Chrysler.  Take it from me, no matter how good this van seems, the support is not there.  They do not know how to fix issues that arise and the parts are always backordered.  STEER CLEAR!!!!

My review from when van was new:

I can't review on reliability or maintenance yet, since I just bought this van on Saturday, but so far I love it.  My kids and I agree that a mom must have designed this van.  Every single feature on the vehicle seems to be so nicely thought out and planned.  There is lots of storage room in the whole van and lots of cupholders!  My almost 16 year old son was unimpressed with the cool factor of going back to a minivan after mom driving SUV's for years but after he rode in and drove the Pacifica, he changed his opinion.  The safety features, including adaptive cruise control are awesome as well as the auto high beam headlights.  The theater system in the van is great and keeps the kids occupied and happy with games, music and movies.  The 2nd row heated seats are also wonderful.  I have owned both Honda and Toyota vans and this one is my favorite by far!  As a matter of fact, my plan was to test drive all three, but I stopped after I fell in love with the new Pacifica!

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Steve, 10/15/2018,Like riding in a limo,5,"It's such a smooth ride! The gas mileage is pretty good on the highway. It's huge inside - must look out for the outside of the car - it's really long and hard to get used to. I love the separate climate controls for driver and passenger - and in back. Very good visibility, but not as good as the Subaru Forester I traded in. It's a long step from the front seats to the ground. Not a fan of the front apron, which is susceptible to being beaten up by high curbs. Very smooth shifting transmission. Cruise control is a little jumpy when going down a hill.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,CarReviewer, 11/04/2016,Drives like a nice car!,5,"CarReviewer 2017 Chrysler Pacifica Limited with Mocha interior, advanced safety tech, towing, 20"" tires drives better than anything I compared in it's price range and even ones that can cost more. It has more features and free XM Sirius for a year, 5 years Travel Link, 0%, rebates, etc. You get a lot for your money when compared to other vehicles. Drives like a very good handling car. Traded in 2010 Ford Flex Limited Ecoboost which was a very good vehicle but Pacifica is better. Well designed minivan, very comfortable, handles well, quiet, smooth driving, good gas mileage, very good stereo, easy to use Nav, great looking inside and out, actually fun and enjoyable to drive, roomy, a lot of storage area, stow and go seats, safety features and more. Did a lot of research for many months even before Pacifica was available and test drove many vehicles including redesigned Mazda CX9, Infiniti, Explorer, Durango, Grand Cherokee, Nissan Pathfinder, Acura MDX, Toyota Highlander, Lexus 350 and others. Drove other minivans in past and didn't care for most interior styling. Pacifica drives better than crossovers. Doesn't seem floaty on highways like some crossovers. Very planted. You don't think your driving a minivan. Very well designed vehicle and put together well with quality looks and parts. So far extremely happy. I don't work for a dealership. Just a very satisfied consumer and I look forward to taking drives in my new Pacifica. I owned a first year model 2005 Chrysler 300C for over 8 years with no problems other than a knob breaking on NAV when they had knobs and got a very good trade in on a leftover 2012 Chrysler 300C Luxury Series I bought in 2013 - a very good vehicle as well. Even though one always wonders about reliability and buying first year cars, I've had good luck with Chryslers and they keep getting better.

Don’t be fooled. I’ve owned my limited pacific for less than 6 months and I have a list of at least 15 things that have broken already. I woke up this morning with a non existent uconnect computer on top of everything else, which means you can’t run the heat apparently. Honestly, I am not going to waste my time listing all of the other major problems including the transmission already?! Bad job Chrysler. Worst car I’ve ever owned. Good thing I have the unlimited warranty. You will pay for all my trouble and inconvenience. Horrible

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Gerald, 01/10/2017,Love/hate relationship w/ my Pacifica,3,"My 2017 Pacifica replaced my 2014 Odyssey. From a driving perspective, it’s a class or 2 above the Odyssey. It’s so much quieter and smoother to drive. 

However, from a functionality and reliability standpoint, it fails compared to the Odyssey. My Uconnect has many quirks and does not functionally normally. I’ve spent over 3 hrs on the phone w/ tech support but there are still many quirks that tech support can’t fix and they recommended that I take it to the dealer. Who has time for that?! The Pacifica’s interior is stylish, but it lacks many nooks and crannies for storage compared to the Odyssey. Also, all the seats are extremely difficult with car seat installation – seat bottom reclines too much, headrest protrudes too much, latch and tether difficult to use and limited 2nd row width to accommodate 3 car seats together comfortably. The Odyssey was 1000x better in this respect.  

So far I’m enjoying the drive. But I miss the day to day functionality of the Odyssey.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Donna Geslak, 09/29/2016,Wow. Feel of SUV with 20inch tires.,5,"It is the first car with the sportyness of an suv and the comfort of a mininvan.   Room for everyone and everything. 20 inch wheels a must.  Only thing that black interior color shows dirt too much, but 2 tone interior of mocha brown and black with light inside top really make the car feel roomy and regal.  Classic car with a very expensive feel.  Great alternative to Escalade.  Better riding views everywhere in car, more comfortable inside without feeling that you are driving a boat.  Pacifica handles beautifully and almost half the price of the Escalade.  Would recommend to anyone.  Get the glass top too.  Wonderful driving experience.  Just wish it was less expensive so that everyone could enjoy the ride with all the bells and whistles without the high price tag.  Lastly it is a very understated car.  I like that because people wont think to steal it first like a BMW or Mercedes, but on the inside it is loaded with luxury.

The 3rd row which is imparitive to my family of 5 is stuck.(and after looking at reviews I see this is common) The dealership (tacoma dodge) has been a nightmare of unorganized and uneducated people attempting to fix it.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Charles Slocum, 04/04/2018,Stop when it wants,3,"We owned the vehicle for 14 months (26,000) and its has been in for maintenance 12 twelve times. The Pacifica has had the engine stop twice while driving. Both times it was very brief (1-2seconds) but still causes great concern. The dealer can't find any errors in the onboard computer and can't find any issues to cause this problem. The transmission every once in a while clunks so severely that you would think you were just hit from behind. Again, the dealer can't find any errors in the onboard computer and can't find any issues to cause this problem, although the module that controls the transmission was recalled and replaced. We love the van and many of the features but feel very unsafe driving it.

Already so many recalls on it but that's not even a biggy for me. I was driving the car on a regular rainy day and the it just stopped running in the middle of the road (seems it's designed to be driven only on sunny days......large sun roof).  Anyway, the car won't start and had to be towed to the dealership. It took my crappy dealership a whole week to figure out what they thought the problem was. They replaced some capacitor only to find out that the engine had knocked. This is over one week later. I was told everything was covered under warranty until they did their tear down and found water in the engine----not covered under warranty; so now I have to deal with my insurance company; all this while running up an expensive rental bill because my useless dealership does not have a loaner. Chrysler is now telling me that paying for my rental is a courtesy that is not guaranteed! Useless car, useless company and useless dealership. DO NOT BUY ANY FIAT CHRYSLER PRODUCT.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Greg, 09/10/2018,Great Pacifica,5,"Owned this van since April 2017 and have almost 16K miles on it.   Has been flawless, except for about 3 recalls (software fixes and seat belt fix) which were all completed in one hour visits.  Combined mpg is about 23 and it lives up to its reputation beating out the competition on the comparison tests on youTube.  This is my 4th Chrys van and the last one was a 2012 T&C Touring L plus.   Granddaughter was so impressed with the van she wrote a school paper on it..... buy it you'll love it.   Tech and Entertainment options are the best.

Update at 19K miles:  On the Pacifica Forum (Internet Web site) you can find out lots of info on this van.  One issue that many owners have identified is paint blisters on the aluminum hood.  A number of owners have identified this issue with pics.  I have one blister on the hood.  Have not taken it in for repair yet.   Chrysler is replacing hoods or repainting hoods to fix the problem.   Problem is concurring because of the galvanic interaction between the mixed metals (aluminum and steel) and failed primers, etc....
Other than the hood issue the van is great, have owned it nearly 2 years and no regrets.

Update 22.3K miles, 2.5 years:  Again on the Pacifica Forum a small number of owners have noticed that where the front bumper fascia meets the drivers headlight there is a very small gap.   Mine has that as well.  Chrysler has replaced the bumper fascia for at least one owner.  Apparently the bumper wasn't installed correctly causing the clips not to grab or fail.  I will have this serviced when the hood blisters are remedied under the 3 yr 36K mile warranty.  Other than these 2 cosmetics (bumper and hood), best vehicle I have owned.  A friend in the development has a 2018 Toyota Sienna, says the Pacifica rides better and has smoother shifting, etc.... I agree.

Have 30 K miles on the van and no new problems or surprises.  Got the hood blisters fixed (hood primed and repainted) under warranty and the gap in the front fascia gap fixed by a body shop while I waited.  When you know what you're doing like this body shop did, it was an easy fix and no charge.  Dealer said if the hood blisters come back they'll fix it under the 5 yr 60 K warranty.  I have been driving nearly 50 years, and this is the best vehicle I have owned or driven.....  Although I was impressed by the Ford Explorer seats that  give a heavy duty massage......

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Not happy, 05/30/2019,Hopefully they'll fix all the problems,2,"I believe there have been 4 recalls already which is less than good...but hey, if the problems are fixed afterwards, not the end of the world.  Of course none of the recalls pertained to any of the issues I experienced with this unit.  ******The electrical system is flawed in a major way.  I've spoken to other owners of this model as well and they are having the same issues.  The monitor where you control the radio, navigation, climate control, etc.....randomly goes out.  Maybe for a few minutes, hours, days or even weeks at a time.  That's right...no radio, no rear view monitor assistance, etc....gone.  Oh and if it is working, it often times will show indicators that the phone requires service and another alert about needing to call 911 or something.  Very weird.  So, I took it in to the dealership.  I'm not sure they even looked at it but their solution was to put a whole new monitor system in for nearly $800 which I did not do.  Again, this issue has been confirmed with other owners as well.  Also, the sliding doors will sometimes not close remotely like they should...especially if on a slight incline.  I think all their units have a silly dial type knob that controls the transmission instead of a shift level.  I hate it but eventually you get used to it.  This is after you accidently try turning it into the park position thinking it's the radio volume control.  Yes, the seats fold down nicely in the back and I don't have other major issues at this point.....at least not yet.  I've had this unit for about 2 yrs now......and I'm.....not happy"

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Tony G, 01/13/2017,Change of Mind,5,"We went from being extremely excited about our new minivan, to increasingly frustrated.  First of,  this van shows off well.  The features, the ride, and its looks we thought set it apart from the competition.  It wasn't until we drove off the dealership when the headache began.  Driving off and seeing the engine light come on is the most disheartning thing an owner of a ""new"" vehicle can experience.  So now, we are stuck with a loner as we wait and see whats wrong with our new Pacifica.  I reached out to Chrysler to see if they can expedite this process (its going to be a week before my van gets looked at the dealership), but they didn't seem too concerned with the idea of one of their products coming off the lot and going straight to the shop.  I'm hopeful our situation gets better.  At this time, I would tell others to beware of Chrysler products.(initial review)

After owning our van for a year and 9000 miles, we are extremely pleased.  There were a couple hipcups in the beginning with dealership service being the primary concern.  The van had a few minor glitches as well, but reasonable considering it was a first year model. My family and I would buy this car in a second if we had to do it again.

One year and a half later, I would buy this van again.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Tej, 09/10/2016,Not the quietest,4,"I have turned in my 2012 Sienna and got the l plus. The claim that Chrysler makes ""quietest in its class"" is absurd. My old sienna was much quieter. The road and wind noise levels even with active noise cancellation is high compared to sienna that does not have active noise cancellation. The adv safety tech is okay, but is more like beta and needs lot of improvement. The stop and go is decent but active steering is awful, don't even try it.

This wouldn't be a huge issues, exept that the computer is horribly underpowered and the response time is extremely slow. I have also noticed a few mechanical issues with the transmission.

Its very easy to load and unload kids, strollers, and carseats. Tons of space behind the 3Rd row and lots more with the 3Rd row down.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,LoveTown&Country, 10/17/2016,Love our Town&Country. Dissapointed by Pacifica.,4,"We have a 2008 Chrysler Town&Country that we love; but we were wanting a new van, and so we went to test drive the Pacifica with the full intent to buy it. But we were extremely disappointed. When they re-designed the van, the designers clearly did not take into account that most people driving vans have families of more than two children (the whole reason to buy a van). While the Town&Country had 2 DVD screens, giving you the option for the third row to watch DVDs without the second row having to see it ( a great feature when you drive other adults in the car); the new Pacifica ignores the third-row-passengers completely. In the Pacifica, there are fantastic in-seat screens for the second row (they are installed on the back of the first row seats), but these screens cannot be seen from the back row when the 8th seat is installed. Which means that if you have any kids in the last row, they do not have the option to watch DVDs. Which seems a huge design-flaw as I know many families whose kids sit in that last row. We presumed that it would be possible to install these in-seat screens for the third row, an obvious fix, but our salesman informed us that that was not possible. So no DVD watching for the passengers in the third row. Meanwhile, if you decide to go  sit in that last row, you quickly realize that the headrests are tilted forward at a sharp angle, which was very uncomfortable for an adult. And they are not adjustable. When we inquired about this, the salesperson told us these seats were meant for children, not adults (so they did want children sitting in that row, just not ones that would want to be entertained by the DVD system). But here is were you run into a bigger problem. Children grow. They do not remain tiny forever. Our oldest just turned 15, and he is 5'9''. Still a child, but too tall for the back row of this minivan, according to our salesperson. Thus, he would have to sit in the middle row, leaving our younger children sitting in the back, whining about the unfairness of the screen situation (and no, you cannot have adjustable headrests installed in that last row). So, while we were really excited about the possibilities of this new van, if you have more than 2 children, the Town&Country was a much better model.

 not inflate. Tow truck came to take me to tire shop. The driver said those inflators never work. At the tire shop I was told
that they could not repair the tire because the sealer was pumped into it. So the cost of a new tire was very close to $200.
and two days to get an exact replacement. Then I found out that I had to replace the inflator sealant , 
another $80 some.and on order.  So a simple flat was going to cost me about $280 something and wait for sealer refill. When 
if I hadn't used the sealant it might have been repaired. To me this is a very bad system in order maybe to keep cost down

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Pat, 02/28/2020,I still love Wally,4,"My Chrysler Pacifica is named Wally and he is a great van.  The engine is smooth and provides excellent acceleration and decent fuel economy.  (The growl from the engine when you get on it always makes me laugh; I think he thinks he's a Dodge Hellcat!) 

The interior is roomy and comfortable with plenty of storage. I use it a lot for our family camping trips and with the fold-down seats, it can carry all of the gear with easy.

On the downside, I continue to hff ave problems with the side door switches not working.   I took it in for repairs under warranty  and they worked for a while but stopped.  Since there are 3 sets of switches for the doors (the overhead console,  the door handles and inside the rear seat area), it's annoying but not enough to spend a lot of money to repair.   I optioned for the 18 inch trims, which are beautiful,  but came with Nexen tires (no, I never heard of them either). They are noisy and terrible in the rain but surprisingly good in the snow.  

Finally, the most disturbing issue is that it is starting to rust on, of all places, the front of the hood.  This may be a feature they got from Fiat, which has the reputation for having the cars disintegrate in front of you eyes.  Hopefully,  I can have a body shop fix this.

Overall, I still love Wally and think the Pacifica is one of the values on the market.

( U Couldn't connect to register) Chrysler Corp HQ finally helped by getting Uconnect service people in contact with me. Why the dealer couldn't fix it was baffling.
Update: 7/25/2017. Two long trips, good mileage on the highway (over 28-29 mpg) smooth ride  although transmission has started slipping or clunking on a quick start. Seems to have trouble finding the right gear.  Front fascia keeps slipping out of position on right front and the back up camera features are off. Camera shows a picture, but Yellow lines showing where you are going are gone as well as the warning beeper when you approach something in your way. Went through the instruction in the owners manual and selected the proper boxes to check. Took it to an out of town dealer while travelling and they couldn't fix the missing features. Cell phones just stopped system pairing. Oil changes cost a lot! Synthetic spec and an extra filter. Dealer says change every 6K. Why synthetic oil then?

Update 7/26/19. Car still performs, dealer fixed the front fascia and blamed the factory for a ""Backward installed clip""  Back up camera features with yellow guidelines that come and go. Transmission clunking is getting worse. Read a web site review of the 9 speed trans,  45 complaints, can't duplicate, no fix. We will take it in soon to see whether they have a clue. Shift the other day was so rough I thought someone hit the back of the car, or I ran over something. Too bad for such a nice vehicle for freeway cruising.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Bill B, 08/26/2017,Executives and Engineers fail to learn or impress,3,"Finding anything other than a black interior takes an act of god. Really a color that absorbs heat and holds it, then shows every speck of dirt or debris possible. The transmission sometimes has a lag or can not decide what to do when you need it to, or you squeal the tires when you did not mean to. The engine has power but at higher altitude it needs to take a breath before moving. The second and third row seats are uncomfortable for extended road trips, not enough adjustment in the head rests on all the seats. Second row seats need more support and rests for adults with third seat removed. Infotainment system needs some improvements with ability to bounce between unset stations while scanning stations without having to set a station. Navigation system is a complete waste of every ones time from the guy who picked the navigation program service; to the guy who installed it and the owner. If you launch a BRAND NEW MODEL at least put in an up to date navigation with better accuracy than what you did. Navigation makes me want to rip it out when awaiting directions.

Chrysler claims  their 2017 Pacifica  will give one +- 19 mpg in-town, up to 29 mpg for highway driving with an average of 22-23 mpg combined.                                       I bought  my new Limited edition Pacifica van in December 2016. The vehicle is very nice but the gas mileage sucks. In town with no stop and go traffic and with no traffic and driving slow and no hard braking or hard acceleration, I get 13 -15 miles per gallon. I took the vehicle on two road trips where only my wife and I were in the vehicle  not loaded. We drive a 3-hour trip to a remote town ( no hills or wind at 70 mile/hour) and three hours back home the same way we went and the gas mileage was 21.5 miles per gallon.  So far I have to fill up the Pacifica  two tanks of gas / 500 milles-- a tank 18 Gallons. My average gas miles for these trips (town 10% of mileage and Highway 90%) were and is  +- 15 to 16 miles/gallon.  I have 1150 miles on the vehicle and Chrysler insist that only after the third oil change the vehicle gas mileage will get better ....wow...third oil change( 15000 miles). This vehicle is a gas guzzler and nearly as fuel inefficient as my 2002 V8 Dodge Durango. I cannot get Chrysler or the dealers to move and fix the van. If I listen to You Tube videos, everybody raves about the good gas mileage they get from theirs or the test Pacifica. What must I do????

I have now been driving this Pacifica for 11700 miles and its fuel efficiency is not good---dealers say it is normal---I get in town, driving like an elderly  person, between 11 and 14.5 mpg. On the Highway driving 70-75 miles per hour I only get at its best, 25 mpg.  The vehicle is nice but I will not recommend it to others due to it bad fuel efficiency!

08/13/2018
The Pacifica is really a gas guzzler nothing changed, it is still very uneconomical and fuel thirsty even after 16,000 miles it  sucks gas! I have spoken to several Pacifica owners. All say it is a nice vehicle but it is not fuel efficient! Chrysler lies about fuel millage!!!!!!!!!!!

Changing my own oil at regular intervals, rotating tires, that’s it. 

Very pleased

2/2020 update. Recently helped my parents move to a retirement home. 

It’s really great for swallowing up large amount of stuff and moving it from place to place. 

Easy for my mom and dad to get in and out. 

Handles rough Michigan roads and winter conditions with no problem. 

Since my last update, I’ve had no reason to bring it in to the dealership. I do regular maintenance on my own. 

Lastly, the pearl red velvet exterior looks great when I regularly wash it. 

8/2019 update. Three years in and still loving this car. Very quiet and smooth ride. It’s very comfortable for long road trips. My kids are fighting over who’s getting the car when we sell it.  

Some details:

Corrosion on hood, dealer matched paint really well and replaced. They even detailed the car inside and out. 

Occasional transmission lurches, dealer replaced torque converter. 

No other issues. 


8/2018 update. Really enjoying this car. Rides quietly and is very comfortable. Seeing 33mpg on the freeway/31mpg while towing.  The red velvet pearlcoat paint looks gorgeous. Trying to keep it washed and looking good. Lots of convenient features including radio controls on the back of the steering wheel. 

Took care of two safety recalls without any problems. The sliding, second-row doors are making grinding noises so we are having the ball-bearings replaced. Apparently, the bearing are on back-order, so we are waiting on those.

Engine and transmission are smooth and quiet.  AC is cold and love the auto-temp feature. 

2/2018 update.  Radio replaced since last update.  No reason to visit Chrysler service (and I’m picky).  Only fair that I upgrade the reliability in Edmunds to 4stars. Love the way it rides and how comfortable the front seats are.  Don’t love that Uconnect is a subscription service.  Kids don’t use the apps on Uconnect anymore because they cannot be added to.  Like I said, I’m picky.

8/2017 update.  Oil change was straightforward.  Oil filter is on top of engine instead of underneath.  Tows my 14 foot fishing boat smoothly.  Added weathertech floor mats to match interior.  Only issue is radio (sound and presets are acting wonky).  Dealer is waiting for new radio to come in (backordered).


Spreading a wide net for a good deal.  Dealer added nav, wheel group, inflatable spare, tow group, locking lugs.  First minivan.  First Chrysler.  No problems.  Ten days in. washed it already.  Seen 33mph on freeway.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Paul, 02/12/2017,Not for me... trading in for a grand caravan GT.,2,"My wife always leased a town and country and we have always loved them. Well Chrysler decided to kill off their best selling car and replace it with this and I knew I should have just bought out of old van. First of all, we do a lot of traveling. The town and country had overhead storage bins that we used all the time and it also had halo lighting like a limo above our heads. It was pretty cool. I was already disappointed that they dropped that feature. Another feature I miss from the town and country is the power vented 3rd row windows. This van cost so much more money and it already is missing 2 features I frequently used. Next, the 9 speed transmision (which I already know is a disaster) is awful. It will be totally fine for a day then the next it is shifting all weird and hard. When this happens the car literally will jump forward and it scares the daylights out of us. Have taken to the dealer 3 times for this and they tell me it is 100% fine and there is nothing wrong with it. This is very aggravating because I do not trust this vehicle on a long road trip or even driving in general. Also, another thing this van is missing is the 3rd row tailgate seats and flashlight from my old van are missing. I don't understand why they dropped some of the best features from the old van. The uconnect system works ok, but freezes every once in awhile which is aggravating. Also I don't know what they did for this van but it is not nearly as insulated as the old town and country. I hear every road noise, every chip, every sound on the outside. It's almost like you can't even enjoy driving it because it's so loud. I do know about the active noise cancellation but it truely does nothing. I had the dealer look into this too and they told me everything is working as it should and it is normal for Pacificas to have ""some road noise"". It's like they admitted this car was loud inside. And reading about the sunroof letting in all the noise is absolutely true. It's terrible. I basically do not like this car at all. Even the way it looks is ugly compared to the town and country. Now for the good: the sound system is great despite the loud noise while driving. If I'm on break at work I like to sit and listen to music in it and it does sound pretty great. Also the ventilated seats are nice in hot weather. It is nice to have a big touch screen compared to the smaller one on the town and country. And having a 3rd row charging port is great too. Also having a button to move the driver seat forward for stow and go is very convenient. Second row seats are very comfortable also. Overall, this car feels like an expensive downgrade from my town and country. My wife wanted another town and country because we have never had any reliability issues with them and we also like the look and features much better. We were disappointed to find out they killed it off. I did complain to the dealer about this car and they did tell me many people are going from the town and country to grand caravan because it's not for them. I just don't like the huge bulky look of the Pacifica either. I know it's a minivan but they really could have done better with the looks on it. I am taking a huge loss but I would rather drive a grand caravan then this van. Ordered a grand caravan GT and should have it by early spring. Can't wait to get away from this vehicle.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Steinar Andersen, 12/03/2017,My 5th Chrysler Minivan,5,"I've owned Chrysler minivans GEN1, GEN2, GEN3, GEN4 (but not Gen 5, I had gotten a 2009 Toyota Sienna XLS instead). So I am back in the saddle with a GEN6 Pacifica (a 2017 Pacifica). I've been VERY surprised with the gas mileage (averaging almost 30 mpg on the highway...... 23 mpg in local driving. I have the Touring L Plus and I have every option available on it (except for the Moonroof and towing). I've had it for 4 months, and it is heads and tails above my 2009 Toyota Sienna XLS regarding every aspect of it's experience. The infotainment system is QUICK. The rear entertainment system has been used extensively on a 1,000 mile trip back and forth to Nashville (and kept my passengers entertained and connected with full support of their electronic devices). The minivan is very quiet, and the NAV system is quite good. So far, only one recall (for the EGR and that was replaced within 30 minutes of my handing the minivan over to the service department). I wish I had a spare tire tho (for peace of mind). I bought this minivan for $38,000 and plan on keeping it for at least 10 years, I am praying that the electronics plus mechanicals prove better than my GEN3 experience (and that this Generation won't rust at the rockers like the Gen4).
==========================================================================
Update 12/5/2020  -  So, I have bought a new 2020 Pacifica within the last year (December of 2019)..I thought I would be in the 2017 Pacifica for ay least 10 years... but prices were right in December (and I got a Pacifica Touring L Plus WITH a Sunroof, an 8th seat, the 4th Gen Uconnect with Android Auto, & an actual inflatable spare tire). It was worth the upgrade & I prefer this one to the Limited.... because I don't have a power rear seat (which are problematic), I don't have the sunroof extending to the rear seat (allowing me to have an 8th seat), and having a spare tire instead of  vacuum.

Now THIS should be the last new vehicle I will ever buy (as the 2021 Pacifica has a new fascia - which I am not a fan of) & an android based Uconnect 5 (but it isn't 5 G - so why bother). This is the most I have ever paid for a vehicle (of any kind) & it is not depreciating like BMW's or Mercedes or Jaguars. Carmakers are pushing electric & will be changing a lot over the next 10 years... no need to buy anything for a while until the dust settles. I suspect electric will fall flat on its face... and the Internal Combustion Engine (along with plug in Hybrid technology) is the wave of the future. Pacifica already has a hybrid, but it needs to get at least another 5 years under it's belt (I am not impressed with the first iteration).

So to summarize... this Pacifica is very upscale, has the best infotainment in the industry, is quiet, gets great MPG, holds its value compared to the luxury car makers, has an indestructible drivetrain (the 3.6L V6 & 9 speed tranny), has stow-n-go, has EIGHT seats (which are all comfortable), & just really looks good. I wouldn't even consider the Toyota, Honda, or Kia (and the Mercedes is a old platform & is tired). HIGHLY recommended.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,sw44057, 08/07/2018,I expected more,3,"We've had multiple recalls in the year I've owned it. One day it stalled and rolled backwards down an off ramp and the brakes would not work. It has now started stalling for no apparent reason.

However the Uconnect is so bad I can’t believe they would release the system at all. Not fix for it. Software update is coming?? Whatever that means. You know you have a hardware issue when a software fix takes so long. No apple car play. I would wait for the 2018.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Anonymous, 08/12/2018,No repair by dealer so traded van. No buy Pacifica,3,"We had a Pacifica van and had a slamming in transmission hitch progressed to more frequently. After having van in shop 5 times and they could not find anything we traded it in. Have girlfriend who also had transmission stop working during snowy season and they were trapped on freeway with children inside. We took van to dealer multiple times and of course their line was we put it on the machine shows nothing. I asked them to drive it and they said they found nothing. There is documented transmission issues with this van. Unfortunately we traded it in to buy a more reliable vehicle. Plelase read reviews before purchasing this beautiful van.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Mike, 11/09/2016,Not designed for tall drivers?,1,"What were the designers thinking?  I went to try out the Pacifica based on reviews.  Adjusted seat and steering wheel but could not get into the van without undue difficulty as too low and cramped.  Could not fit comfortably in front seat, roof too low, controls not placed correctly.  Rear vision impeded by pillars and obstructions.  Vehicle ground clearance is too low and long overhang beyond front wheels (not good for places that have a lot of rain/runoff.)  Immediately tried out Dodge Grand Caravan.  No problems with ingress or egress.  Could adjust controls perfectly. Had several inches headroom.  With rear seat/ headrests folded, had no problems with rear visibility.  Conclusion - The Pacifica designers were all short people or maybe they only feel short people would buy one?  .  My sister-in-laws' husband had the exact same experience in another city/dealer and he is shorter/larger than I am (I am 6'2''.)  Why design a minivan only for shorter people????
"
chrysler,pacifica,2017,Charles Urban, 07/27/2016,2017 Chrysler Pacifica has 3 flaws,4,"The digital speedometer and computer screen are very difficult to see, read during afternoon sunlight. The transmission has lots of play when put in, out of park. The driver's and passenger seat are too far away from the door entry. It takes long legs, a big step from the ground outside to get into the seats.
"
chrysler,pacifica,2017,K-anon, 11/28/2016,"Paid a lot, got a lot",4,"My wife and I spent months researching and test driving almost all minivans on the market. The clear winner was the Pacifica. We purchased a brand new blue Touring L-Plus in September 2016. We've been driving it for nine months and have had a fender bender (rear ended) and had the van repaired. We've been on three big road trips and have over 9,000 miles on the van. We've been averaging around 17-18 mpg in the city and about 27 mpg on the highway, so pretty darn close to the manufacturer specs.

One annoyance is that the transmissions has to really kick into a much lower gear when you want to accelerate on the highway. Say you are cruising at 60mph, the transmission will be in top gear, but say you want to accelerate to 70 mph, it'll hesitate for a second, then shift anywhere from 1-3 gears lower to provide power to accelerate. It doesn't feel smooth or sound smooth, but if that's what it takes to get me better mileage, I'll sacrifice the 'smoothness'.

The storage space is just wonderful; the van is quiet, handles great, and has so far been very reliable. We learned that the rear hatch is made of partly magnesium alloys, so in our fender bender, they had to order a whole new rear hatch (it was expensive, but our insurance covered it). The Blueray/DVD entertainment system is super popular with our kids. Be aware though, they young kids (under 5) have no hope of figuring out how to listen to their movies on the headphones. We just use the 'listen in' feature and have to listen to their movies/shows wherever we drive. I recommend the van; we have no regrets about our purchase to date.

Update (May 2018) - We've had some electrical problems (door chimes not sounding, part replaced to fix) also, the power windows don't work consistently. We haven't been able to find out why this is happening or have it fixed. It's really annoying when it happens, and you have to cycle the van off/on to get it to work again. But overall, the mileage and the features have outweighed some of the annoyances. I am concerned about the transmission, but no major problems yet. We now have almost 30,000 miles in about 20 months of ownership.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,drramesh28@yahoo.com, 10/27/2016,Test drove Limited edition,1,"I have 2011 Toyota Sienna, its 5.5 years old and has done 68000 miles, so I decided to buy another mini van, since Toyota sienna has planned to release their next model in spring 2017 and Odyssey is planning to release their next model by the end of this year, I decided the new Pacifica limited edition because of the hype that I have seen in the ads. This van looks good from front and kind of OK from rear ( rear is little bit shorter looking). The interior has a good speedometer display and I liked the in seat built entertainment system ( has 1 behind the diver seat and 1 behind the passenger seat). The second/third row seats are thin when compared to front seats and that over all looks weird. The storage cabinet between the diver seat and passenger seat are poorly made of cheap plastic and does not compare to the quality and storage capacity of sienna. The drive it self was very average when compared to my 5 year old seinna. We were waiting for a green signal , when the engine vibration was passed on to the van and the entire van started vibrating, my wife and I thought that the sales rep was shaking his leg but he wasn't. This van is no match for the quality of Toyota or Honda's. Consumer report even doubts the reliability of Chrysler brands and I completely agree with them. Other tactics these dealers use is, they will advertise a very low priced deal ( saying ""get your internet price"", this vehicle was $48000 and was listed for $41650), I went to the dealer in schaumburg, IL and asked about it and they said that vehicle was sold out??? Sold out in middle of the night? Beware buyers. Quality absolutely sucks. It all looks good on TV, but test drive it for at least a few miles before you commit to buy.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Eugene Kesner, 04/27/2019,"Great vehicle normal, not so great at times",4,"On three occasions, two times during this month, I've had problems with the transmission not immediately engaging.  At least that's my belief.  I placed the gear into a drive or a reverse position.  Both times it appeared that the gear did not immediately engage.  After a short time, less than 30 seconds, the gear engaged and the vehicle rapidly moved in the direction of the gear selection.  I contacted the Chrysler Corp after each of those episodes.  I was told to take it to the local Chrysler dealer and have it checked.  I was told by the dealer they drove the vehicle several times and could not duplicate the problem.  There was nothing they could do without knowing what caused that problem.  Since the problem occurred just two times I didn't expect the technicians to be able to duplicate the problem.  I do believe this could be a dangerous situation.  Also, I have never been able to reach the advertised highway MPG.  The advertisement reflects the vehicle reaches 28 MPG highway.   I have attempted by proper driving techniques etc to reach that figure.  But, I seldom have been able to pass 26 MPG range.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Matt, 11/18/2019,Wacky Transmission and No Solution,3,"The Pacifica looks like a great deal on paper, and even test drives well. The features that it offers seem to check all the right boxes, and at a price that Honda and Toyota can't match. Watch out though! You get what you pay for. 

The transmission issues that are widely reported are true. The vehicle will randomly decide it doesn't want to shift from first to second gear, so then you're left in neutral for a second, not able to accelerate, until it finally decides to kick back into gear. I say ""kick"" because it jolts the whole vehicle like you've just been rear-ended even though your foot hasn't changed position on the accelerator.

We took it to the dealer with this problem prior to the 3 year/36,000 mile warranty being up and have taken it back multiple times over the past year. They've done all they can do at this point, but the problem still occurs with about the same frequency. It only happens occasionally and doesn't usually repeat in the same trip, so it's hard to even get the mechanic to experience the problem.

Everything except the transmission seems to work fine, so if you can live with this kind of random jerky transmission performance then this minivan is a great value. I couldn't put up with it, and after owning it for a year and a half ended up trading it in for a different make of minivan.

Good acceleration and reasonable mileage for a vehicle that has this much room inside.  It is extremely easy to drop down the stow and go seats and create a tremendous amount of room for hauling whatever you need.  With the seats up, it is easy to transport 6 adults.  The remote start capability is quite nice when you need to cool the car down in the heat of summer."
chrysler,pacifica,2017,David, 02/21/2017,Love our Pacifica,5,"The car is super comfortable. My have has difficulties finding a comfortable driver and passenger seat in cars because of her lupus, but the touring l plus has fully adjustable power driver and passenger seats, the limited did too but the ventilated seats were too hard. Ours has the advanced safetytec package, and I highly recommend it.This car seems to help you monitor everything without being obtrusive or annoying. The rear seat entertainment system on the L Plus is great with games you can play, inputs to connect devices and ability to control rear climate settings. 
Update: we've had our Pacifica for 2 years and we still love it. I did lower one star on reliability because I feel we've had it in the shop a few times. My wife says it has an electronics poltergeist because the radio had to be updated 3 times before it worked right, sometimes you open the hatch and the alarm goes off(no issue found) and periodically the sliding doors say power sliding doors not available, operate manually (dealer says no issues found). However these are infrequent and overall we really love it.

I have never bought a car from the Chrysler group and never bought an American car because of all I have heard throughout the years. Buy my wife and kids wanted a spacious car and we rented a Kia Sedona and a Toyota Sienna and enjoyed the space. So we traded in out perfect (German built) Mercedes GLA 250 4Matic for this Chrysler Pacifica Limited. AS we drove off the dealer lot we start hearing a noise like something was loose on the roof. We had to stop on the way home and found nothing visibly loose outside. It sounded something was just loose on the top. We quickly found out it was the roof glass that was not assembled tight. Went back to the dealer. They took it in and filled the top with dirty grease just to tell me that the glass was not assembled correctly and I had to take the car in next week so they could work on it. All this is just plain unacceptable and unbelievable to me. As I take full responsibility for actually going to a Chrysler dealer and buy this car, I recommend you to keep your money.

In my opinion, the factory roof rack is too small to accommodate cargo like two kayaks and/or bicycles and/or cargo boxes.

We'll be keeping our TOWN & COUNTRY,3,"Anticipated that the new Pacifica would be a new and greatly improved version of our 2014 Chrysler T&C and the Pacifica is NOT.   Although it rides noticeably quieter and somewhat smoother - that's about it.   It doesn't handle any better and it has less interior room and worse visibility than the T&C.   The second row seats fold into the floor more easily but they are not more comfortable.   Pacifica uses a keyless ignition system which I find annoying.  The gears are shifted by turning a small dial - why ?   It's so awkward and weird and offers no advantage over a gearshift lever.   The radio/media system has a big screen but is not intuitive and daunting and distracting to decipher.  Cost-wise, you get far less bang for your buck than with a T&C.   If you are in the market for a minivan, I would strongly recommend the T&C over the Pacifica any day.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Gizmo, 01/24/2017,Love the Pacifica but wife not interested in miniv,5,"I love the Pacifica I think it's gone a long way from the boring looking town and country. The view from the inside with the panoramic roof makes me want to go on a road trip!!! The dash looks very clean contemporary and techy- great use of space lighting and ""high end"" appearing monitors. Ride was smooth and quiet and everything my family needed but wife wanted anything but a minivan so being that it's her car she went with the pilot which is a great choice too but for me and our family of 5 (mom dad two boys and a baby girl) our trips to Disney would have been so much more convenient and spacious with the Pacifica! Happy wife happy life. Hope this helps!

"
chrysler,pacifica,2017,MAJOR, 08/25/2018,OWNER,4,"The fuel mileage is very poor and way below the posted estimate.  Vehicle seems to idle faster than necessary.   The van does steer much tighter in turns than our previous 2011 limited.  It is quieter than our prior van somewhat.  The windshield/roof line slopes back low over the front entry so you really have to duck your head while entering.  The shift knob does not click between settings and is next to the fan control and radio knobs so you have to look closely when reaching for one of the controls.  The gauge and center map display lighting is not easily adjustable for day/night driving.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Satisfied so Far, 10/20/2016,So far so good (4 months),5,"Bought this limited this summer before kick to open doors and vacuum included. 7000+ miles including a long road trip.  Excellent adaptive cruise and braking-- saved us from 3 accidents so far. Auto wipers and high beams work well.  Top of the line stereo a little muddy sounding. Gas mileage for me a bit disappointing-- averaging 18 mpg-- mostly city driving.  Handles great. Couple minor defects so far. Wish it came with apple car play this year. HIghly Recommend the Limited!

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Eliot C., 01/28/2018,Hooked on my Chrysler,5,"I have owned as many as 4 Chrysler vans ( and convertibles) over the years. My present van is a 2003 Linited  loaded with 250K ++ miles that does NOT burn oil and gets the rated gas mileage still. It drives like  great auto still highway and city. It tools along without vibrations and tracks true. Road sounds have been my biggest complaint not noted in the Pacifa at all.  Of course I have maintained my car extremly well with synthetic oils and replacement of mechanical accessories when they fail but NEVER touched the engine save for a rebuilt transmission and a valve and oil pan gasket change. It has been safe and comfortable and hauled tons of people and gear, furniture art and all manner of materials in and out (roof rack).  I have gotten my moneys' worth and more. Now it comes time to admit that I am ready for the new state of the art van although mine still looks great with minor rust and small dings etc. I test drove the Pacifica a number of times this year and researched the idea of a new car. I want a one year old because I do not want that first years' depreciation. It exceeds my needs and demands for a van or auto. I love the visibility, the safety of a heavier vehicle, and the mass of structure to protect me, my children, grandchildren and friends, clients etc..and all the features the Pacifica carries. Not enough color choices.  I drive a car a Long time so I have to live with a color I like inside and out.    Eliot

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Not happy, 05/30/2019,Hopefully they'll fix all the problems,2,"I believe there have been 4 recalls already which is less than good...but hey, if the problems are fixed afterwards, not the end of the world.  Of course none of the recalls pertained to any of the issues I experienced with this unit.  ******The electrical system is flawed in a major way.  I've spoken to other owners of this model as well and they are having the same issues.  The monitor where you control the radio, navigation, climate control, etc.....randomly goes out.  Maybe for a few minutes, hours, days or even weeks at a time.  That's right...no radio, no rear view monitor assistance, etc....gone.  Oh and if it is working, it often times will show indicators that the phone requires service and another alert about needing to call 911 or something.  Very weird.  So, I took it in to the dealership.  I'm not sure they even looked at it but their solution was to put a whole new monitor system in for nearly $800 which I did not do.  Again, this issue has been confirmed with other owners as well.  Also, the sliding doors will sometimes not close remotely like they should...especially if on a slight incline.  I think all their units have a silly dial type knob that controls the transmission instead of a shift level.  I hate it but eventually you get used to it.  This is after you accidently try turning it into the park position thinking it's the radio volume control.  Yes, the seats fold down nicely in the back and I don't have other major issues at this point.....at least not yet.  I've had this unit for about 2 yrs now......and I'm.....not happy

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Disappointed, 08/25/2019,Not worth it,1,"I chose the 2017 Pacifica Limited for all of the tech and options that the car boasted. I was quickly let down by transmission issues followed by paint issues. The 9-speed transmission will randomly hesitate and bang into gear, jerking the car and making a loud bang. Chrysler has no fix for this and since it happened randomly it’s impossible for the dealer to duplicate. Then, just after a year of ownership we noticed bubbly paint on our hood. Our dealer, who were awesome, had their body shop repaint the hood. Then a month after our hood was redone, we noticed spots on one of our sliding doors. Again, our dealer was great, submitted the claim to Chrysler, and repainted the door. By this point I had made up my mind to ditch this vehicle. I traded it in for a Pilot and haven’t looked back. I feel like this paint issue was going to keep happening and at some point, Chrysler/my dealer would no longer take care of it. So disappointing because as far as comfort and tech- the van was great. I would NOT recommend this car. 
"
chrysler,pacifica,2017,Mike, 09/25/2019,So far better than the last min van,5,"Traded a VW Routan (Town & Country badged as VW) that was a nice riding loaded van but in the shop every 6-8 months costing us over a grand.  So the next time the check engine light came on we traded it for this used van.

After the first tank of gas the check engine light came on - fixed under the factory warranty - evap device.

Wife finds it hard to drive with all the features and the touch screen.  She is used to knobs and buttons.  It will take some getting used to.  Ours has many options and the light color interior that was the selling point.  The trip color interior is awesome.

What we like - the lane assist is great for when you have to take your eyes off the road to operate the uconnect or anything that does not have a easy to feel knob or button.  The adaptive cruise control is awesome; we use it in town and on the freeway.  The front and rear sensors, cameras and the 360 camera are well worth having.  The cameras are a huge step up from the first generation of back-up cameras.  The sensors will pick up cars coming from a good distance when backing out of a parking space.

Ours does not have the sunroof and the entertainment system on the roof so head room and visibility is better; DVD players are on the back of the front seats.  Not as many cup holders as the last van.

The ride is much better and it is a bunch more quieter for both wind and road noise.  Electric assisted steering is new to use and takes some getting used to.  Easy to see out of but it would be nice to have fold down head rests for the rear seating to see better.  We keep the seats folded down to improve the visibility to our blind spots.  Looks like you can still get a 4' X 8' sheet of plywood in the back.  Nothing better than having the guy with a pick up truck watch you do that and put in 10' sticks of PVC pipe in and then close the back hatch!

Using the round shifter knob and electric parking brake takes a few weeks to get used to.  Not having a spare tire is a disappointment and I did not know about that when buying the van.  If you want a owners manual you have to buy it as you only get a DVD or download the PDF from the web.  It's about 800 pages!  Gas mileage is poor; not getting close to what is advertised.

Over all it is the best thing we have ever owned.

The way it drives, its look, its features (when they work), space, all are amazing!! However, from day one we have had our Uconnect freeze on us and the dealership can’t fix it and we aren’t the only ones. It is not worth it to buy this and have this issue. We can’t use our Bluetooth for calls, can’t use navigation system, can’t listen to the radio. When it works, it’s awesome! But it doesn’t work most of the time. It has been a terrible experience because of Uconnect. We will be trading it in soon and getting an entirely new make and model van. Chrysler needs to fix this, but they haven’t. People have issues with their 2019!! So, screw them. They lost us for sure. "

I feel like I've been ripped off. There is no DVD player, navigational,  and no USB for the children to charge up their electronics in the back seats.  I have told everyone that said they may be buying a Pacifica not to because  it is not for the soccer moms like the Town and Country. I told them to go to Honda. Everything on television is a lye.  Spacious. Yes. Front passenger seat is uncomfortable for a disabled person. Make sure you think about it closely before you buy it.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,James Autry, 08/07/2017,DVD troubles,5,"After one year and 4000 miles we are still very happy. We still find the electronics a little too complicated but feel if we drove it more we would be comfortable with it. We would like more cup holders in front and back.
We much preferred the console in our 2012 T & C. We especially like the collision avoidance, lane change and active cruise control features. We averaged 29.6 MPG on a recent trip from Philadelphia to Raleigh, NC. We still average around 18 Mpg for our normal driving routine.
So, after 3 years and 13,000 miles, we are still happy with our Pacifica. Totally love the adaptive cruise control. We have not had any problems to report.

Almost totally love my new Pacifica. Only problem is the DVD/CD system. Loading and playing a new disc takes at least 60 Seconds and can take more than two minutes if it is a well used disc. There is no hour glass or spinner to indicate it is working but there are pop ups that you 
end up futiley pressing on the touch screen. When it finally starts playing, on screen prompts like ""fast play"" or ""extras"" do not respond so you are forced to wait until they time out and watch the previews every time you play the disc.
OK, so now I have had the Van aboiut 7 months and have driven it 2200 miles. Still love it. Turns out the DVD problems were almost all me. I finally found a salesman that understood and shiowed me how to use it, then it was good.
Only problem now is the auto emergency brake release doesn't always work. (does always work in the shop.) Waiting for it to get worse so the mech sees it.
Finally, because I use it infrequently, the ""APPS"" screen is still confusing such that I have to pull off to do things like turn on/off the heated steering wheel.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Jim Finley, 10/29/2018,Love the car,4,"Shifter knob is a poor design;  four times the rear brake assist locked up.  Had to have vehicle towed once, my wife did not know what was happening on another occasion, vehicle was on ice and she kept trying to back out.  she burned the studs off the front tires because rear brake assist would not release. Two more events but we now had experience, and shut off car for 10 minutes to reset computer.  Ok if your not at an intersection like my first experience and was towed. Climate controls funky, goes from unable to warm to way too hot in 2 degrees of temp setting.  Windshield fogs easily and constantly.  On the positive side, very, very quite, smooth ride, handles great.  Electronics, touch screen, usb ports, perimeter sensors,  all good features. Roomy, comfortable, lots of storage space. Great gas mileage. Had to have DVD system rebooted, and Sirius radio takes 20-25 minutes to get acquire a signal.  Reprogrammed, have It down to 10 minutes.
11/11/2019  Update;  Sirius radio problems still remain after 2 years, and replacing the radio.  Still takes 20 min. to "" acquire signal"".  Brake issues have not occurred lately, climate controls still funky. Still consider this a great vehicle.

chrysler,pacifica,2017,Chad, 12/06/2018,Video and GPS interface is unsafe,3,"The video controls have no button info and is extremely clunky. For instance you have 4 direction arrows and an ok button. No play button. So when the kids are wanting a movie to play you are blindly trying to get it to work while trying not to get into an accident. Having to change disks or interact with the video system while driving is not uncommon and really being stopped isn't any better. The GPS is more of the same. The voice commands while driving are extremely limited as to what you can say. It does not find normal reference points (could be from the lack of understood commands and references), it starts by asking you what country you are in, if it messes up the voice recognition in the 5 or 6 questions it asks you, you have to start over which is 70% of the time. The styling is great, the performance is as expected from a known platform but the user interface execution with the knowledge there are kid demands is some of the worst I have ever used. As a user of a vehicle like this and as a parent you have enough distractions, trying to use basic functions of the interface shouldn't be your biggest distraction. You are taking your eyes off the road way too much to try to figure out the vague controls that you just end up pushing whatever because there is no function assigned but its the only thing you have. Whoever designed this must not have kids and missed the idea to design a safe, easy, and a stress free user interface. This van concerns me for the safety of my family when sending my wife and kids out in it.

Yes, Space is cleverly designed with seat or cargo compartment under the leg floor. There is a plenty of power under the hood and acceleration is really good. You will never get disappointed on the power. Keep in mind fuel economy thus shies a bit around 17mpg combined and 22 on highway. (all readings actual on long runs)The autobreaking on pre-collission is a bit tricky since it is depends on the speed if they are active or not.  Chrysler does not precisely say at what speed it starts monitoring. It definitely will not work while parking. But Automatic rear breaking starts working ok-ish  after I clocked 4000 miles.  Ride comfort and noise isolation (using ANC) seems really good. Very good entertainment system.

Very little problems and extremely versatile. The sto-and-go is amazing and only takes a few seconds to create an insane amount of space. You can literally lay a 4x8 sheet of drywall flat in the back. 

 As far as tech goes, this is one smart vehicle. With the adaptive cruise control, it will see what you may miss. This vehicle will preform a panic stop if a vehicle slams on their breaks in front of you. A great piece of mind. The parking feature is great also, not only will it parallel park itself, but will also perpendicular back into a parking spot. 

Also worth noting is the rear entertainment system with extremely clear pictures on both monitors. Cool idea that the right seat rear passenger can play preloaded apps against the left rear seat passenger. Only wish there were additional apps that could be downloaded. 

The camera system is also awesome. Reverse, front facing, right, left and a top down view that somehow seamlessly meshes them together is very cool and a tremendous help when navigating tight areas. 

Couple that with great gas mileage, a sporty look and plenty of power and it’s the perfect vehicle. "

I like the Atlas among all the SUVs I tested and sat in. I also looked at Odyssey and Pacifica. I like the stow & go arrangement. The interior is a shade better than the odyssey. the screen on the new 2018 model is much more responsive. The 360 camera sold me big time as I find that an extremely valuable feature. This is not available in the Honda, not sure why for such a large vehicle. It is a huge safety feature. The stop and go ACC is better than it functioned in the Odyssey (Which stops at 20 mph, unlike the CRV version). The 9 speed transmission also shifted much better on the Pacifica. The park assist function is so so. Hit or miss but helpful nevertheless. Between backup camera and 360 deg camera, you have more than enough assistance needed to park this big minivan. It is very big but does not drive big. Overall, I am not sure of the reliability unlike the great Honda. I have decided to give the Pacifica engineers my money. Hope it all works out. This is my first Chrysler product.

chrysler,pacifica,2018,ChrisP, 11/04/2018,Love it!,5,"I decided that I needed to write a review since other reviews helped me when researching my vehicle purchase.          I love my Pacifica. After 1.5 years of ownership I have had no problems and I am still impressed by the ride, and the fit and finish of the vehicle.      I have never owned a Chrysler product prior to this  and to be honest I was a little nervous about jumping into Mopar world.        I’m glad that I did.  We tested an Odyssey and a Sienna but we felt that the Pacifica seemed to have the same (or better) fit and finish, ride quality and options than the competition and at a lower price.      Things I would change:  -there are no paddle shifters or any other method to select specific gears (I live in a hilly area).  -headlights: like most new cars the xenon headlights look great but the light beams are very focused and don’t do a good job of lighting the areas along the sides of the road.  This is not specific to the Pacifica and all cars seem to be going this direction but I agree with consumer reports; xenon headlights stink.

chrysler,pacifica,2018,Chance, 12/07/2018,Great for our needs,5,"We went from a 2013 Sienna and have owned a 2018 Pacifica for approx. 1 month now. Overall fit and finish of the Chrysler is very well. The interior quality is almost luxury car like. Rattles and interior noise is Amazing. Driving the Pacifica from a sienna is also much better. The Sienna felt very heavy and would roll going around curves and dips and such. The pacifica feels much more stable and planted to the road. Even though the Pacifica is a bit smaller and you can tell it in some aspects, we felt like it wasn't a difference that we would notice.  The stow-n-go is great. Seat comfort is Great! The infotainment system one morning wouldn't show that I have heated seats and wouldn't let me turn them on or anything. I tried restarting the van a few times, but this didn't resolve till after work when starting it up and everything was fine.  This has only happened one time and I'm not sure what was going on.  I see a lot of complaints on the Transmission being rough and shifting clumsy, but I have never had it stumble or anything that I feel like I should be worried about it. Fuel mileage is beyond what I was expecting. We drove a 300 mile trip the first week we had it, and averaged 27.6. Around town and to the house (which is 10 miles in the country) and start ups to warm up (15-20 mins) every morning, we are now averaging right at 23 mpg. The sienna with the same daily driving we were below 19. Overall Great Van and Great Family Pleaser. Would recommend to other families needing a crossover or Minivan.

chrysler,pacifica,2018,Rose Marie C, 03/12/2018,"Horrible Car! Electronics Failed, Safety Hazard",1,"I have had this car since late August and have had electrical problems with it from the first week.   The electronics system went dead twice while I drove the car on a long distance trip.  A few days later, the side door failed to open and close electronically AND the car issued an engine malfunction message on the radio screen.   The Adapitve Cruise Control/Forward Cruise Control has also failed several times. Brought the car back to the dealer over 20 times to repair these problems. These are safety problems and should have been repaired immediately. In addition, Chrysler has falsely advertised that this car has wifi capability.  It doesn't.  I was able to connect a hotspot in the car for a month and then without notifying me, the hotspot was cancelled BUT I was still charged by AT&T.   I've contacted Chrysler about all of these problems and was transferred to 3 different case managers who simply tried to get me to sign a release in exchange for one month's payment of my lease.  I asked to return this car so many times and each time was stonewalled.  I have wasted so much time driving back and forth to the dealership to get this car repaired and the problems continue.  Buyers BEWARE!!!

chrysler,pacifica,2018,Ron, 03/27/2018,Sienna / Odyssey recent converts,5,"Having come from an 03 Odyssey and a 12 Sienna, my wife and I were all set to purchase another Sienna when our 12 LE was totalled.  But when we took a detailed look and test drive of the Pacifica -- we did not look back.  The Pacifica is a distinct step up in luxury and technology.  The ride is superb for a minivan -- the tight firmness of the Odyssey with the comfort and strong engine of the Sienna.  However, the Pacifica is better -- quiet ride, solid body, excellent technology.  We targeted our features:  Advanced Safety Tech pkg (for her) and Alpine / 8.4 in UConnect upgrade (for me) and Leather (both of us).  With the strong incentives, buying a new Pacifica vs a used XLE Sienna was $5K difference -- and fully worth it.  Both of us absolutely love our vehicle.  I have rented many cars/SUVs in my time (work) and really enjoyed the luxury of the Toyota Avalon/Buick Enclave-- the best of all the rentals.  This new Pacifica Touring L feels just like that -- in a minivan form!  Be sure to look at the 2018 version -- Apple Carplay/Android Auto is now standard and opt for the AST package if possible.

chrysler,pacifica,2018,LauraJ, 01/28/2019,Love it hate it- 2019 Pacifica L,3,"Love the  beauty, comfort, and feel of the van.  Perfect floor plan and seating arrangement.  Hate the transmissions rough shifting in the lower gears.  Driving around town can be a not so smooth ride while the gears figure out what to do!!  Have been to dealership many times to find out from the master mechanic that this is how the ZF 9 speed transmission behaves.  Waiting for a software update to smooth the slower speed shifting-then it will be the best vehicle ever.  Until then....

chrysler,pacifica,2018,Dad, 05/13/2018,Kids are proud of this minvan!!!,5,"We bought the S-package with 20"" wheels more because this car had the best price - but everyone is commenting on the appearance of this vehicle and the kids are actually proud to show this car  to their friends. For us adults, it drives great and is super quiet. Our gas mileage is better than the EPA average of 22.5."
chrysler,pacifica,2018,Stanton, 12/13/2018,Switched from a Honda Odyssey to Pacifica and back,4,"UPDATE: We drove the Pacifica for over a year and enjoyed it. It is a really good van option but in the end we really missed the standard features that Honda provides and the Odyssey was more substantial feeling over time. We just switched back to a new Odyssey and while there are some things that Chrysler is doing right on the Pacifica, they still need to work on creature comforts that Honda has nailed on the Odyssey. Also, fit and finishes need to be improved to truly compete with Honda.

Original:
Our family of six has had 2 Honda Odysseys, 2006 EX-L and 2012 EX-L, since we first needed a van so I was a little hesitant with trying out Chrysler but since they are the originator of the minivan I thought we'd try them out. I'm glad that we did so far. We've only had the Pacifica for a couple of months but love it so far. We've made a couple of trips in it and used for a daily driving...my wife is still amazed at the quality of the ride and performance this van provides. I enjoy driving it around, as well. Both of our Odysseys had suspension issues starting at 80k miles so we've yet to get anywhere close to that mileage (less than 2000 miles currently) but it already drives much smoother than both of those vans ever did. The legroom in the middle row seats is a little less than the Honda but the stow-n-go feature honestly makes up for it. Also, the middle row seats can fold forward while a toddler or infant seat is still fastened in which allows for 3rd row seat access without having to walk between the middle row seats. The rear cargo space is larger than the Honda and the seats sit a little further away from the rear door which is comforting considering two of my most favorite people in the world sit back there. The 3.6L engine offers quite a bit of thrust, as well, so if you are trying to get around traffic or just need to pass someone the power is readily available.

chrysler,pacifica,2018,Roger, 09/08/2018,Fantastic Mini Van,5,"After about 8 months and 10,000 miles, this mini van has been perfect.  We didn't look at any other vehicles because we wanted something that could kind of double as a pickup.  The seats easily fold into the floor and we can haul 4 x 8 sheets of plywood.  It is also great for taking trips.  There is plenty of luggage space when traveling with another couple.  The gas mileage is a little surprising, we usually get around 30mpg on the highway.

chrysler,pacifica,2018,Joyce, 10/11/2018,I was rear ended and totaled,5,"This vehicle is a delight to drive.  But the safety features on this van are incredible.  We were rear ended on an interstate hwy. the Pacifica was totaled...but we walked away safe and sound. No one could believe we were not seriously injured after seeing the van's condition.  I trust this vehicle and I'm getting a 2019 as soon as I can!

chrysler,pacifica,2018,Robert DeBolt, 10/31/2017,I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS CAR!!!,1,"I have had my Chrysler Pacifica Limited for 2 months and it is the worst car I have ever owned from a reliability perspective.  Five things have failed and it has been in the shop twice so far.   Whenever the car is wet, the hands free entry fails.  Whenever the environment is cold, the lift gate does not open fully.  The UConnect screen has gone blank.  I have a very hard time filling it with fuel if the fuel pump has a vent shroud around it.  The pump thinks the car is full and shuts off.  The rear (3rd row) electric seats have failed and the car is in the shop now being repaird (10/30/17).   I do not recommend this car!

chrysler,pacifica,2018,Mixed Feelings, 05/18/2018,"Very poor electronics & Finish, No gear control",3,"Computer get hanged and reset, again ..again .. again.. when it happens - no navigation, no radio, no warning... no solution.  Finish quality issues: Loudspeakers buzzing (more so on the rear - service found poor installation problems). Rear door starts acting up (after one closes them ..  a few seconds later they open by themselves). Navigation system, lightyears behind anything you can put on your cellphone. The Biggest handling complain ==> Gear only support D & L - any steep climb / steep slope down, the lack of control on the gear range (like any other minivan, SUV etc) you either press the breaks way too much , or car hunts for gears all the time. I was surprised how concerned I was and non relaxed on down slopes in Sequoia and Yosemite. This is by no mean my first trip, but this is the worst experience compared to other cars I drove there. On the positive :: Amazingly good seats for driver and passenger, Best in class seats for the kids in the back. Tested the competition.. the kids wont hear about the others.

chrysler,pacifica,2018,Bob K, 10/04/2018,First New vehicle in a looong time,5,"Rented a Caravan for a two couple trip.  Wife really liked it but it was very basic.  Looked at all minivans, drove Honda and Pacifica.  Pacifica won due to ease of interior reconfiguration.  Not perfect but for our use, much preferred. Found a dealer willing to offer a great price on the Touring L and was much impressed during the 65 mile trip home.  Will get comparable mpg as our Sable.  At our age this will get 7000 miles per year and will last at least 15 years or more IF the dependability holds up.  Chrysler’s seem to very good or awful.  We are hoping for very good!  We are passed the kid stage but Mom in Law will enjoy watching movies during our trips.  If someone is looking for a minivan, this one deserves a look.

Follow up comments...
Outstanding on a road trip.  Quiet, the movie system worked great for middle seat passengers, highway miles were 28 plus.  Very comfortable with lots of power when needed.  We remain both impressed and satisfied with this purchase.  If there is a complaint, it would be with Chrysler not using US made tires...Hard to understand that decision.

chrysler,pacifica,2018,Bill, 10/02/2018,3 month check up,5,"I would like to say that this car like any on the market is not perfect. Though I rate it at 5 stars it simply means that I am satisfied with the car's performance in each category and not that it exceeds all others.  Yes the Stow and Go seating is great and one of the main reasons that I purchased the vehicle.  I have not had any issues requiring service beyond the initial purchase. I Like others feel the 9 speed transmission could use some refining to be as smooth as older automatic configurations and I would like the option of greater downshift control.  What sold me on the car in the first place was the greater amount of options available for a car with cloth seats. Still there were options that I would have liked to have had, like the adaptive cruise control, but were excluded because of my preference. (Due to the Florida sun my personal first requirement is cloth seats.) The greatest detraction of the Pacifica was the ESS, the engine stops when you stop at a light.  (I will gladly pay the hundred dollar plus price for the electronic module that disables this feature once it is developed for this model.)  I have owned other mini vans of different manufactures and did compare them again before I purchased the Pacifica. I will admit that the Pacifica was not the first van I looked at but it did merit becoming my first choice.  I have also driven some competing manufacturers vans since I acquired this one and the experiences have confirmed that the Pacifica was the right choice.  I believe the U Connect system is the best electronic package of the three manufactures and I am pleased with the car as a whole.  It has proven to be both comfortable and reliable meeting my expectations.   Yes I recommend this van and would buy it again.

chrysler,pacifica,2018,Dave S., 05/14/2018,Delivered new with defective Park Assist,4,"After looking at the Honda, Toyota, Kia and Chrysler minivan offerings we decided on the Chrysler Pacifica Limited mostly because of the technology advantage this minivan has. The snow and go seating was a really important feature for us. I had sworn off Chrysler products after buying a new Jeep Grand Cherokee in 2002 that was delivered with at least 4 serious defects and the car was constantly in the shop for multiple days at a time. Unfortunately the Pacifica was delivered with the front park assist sensors not working and a message on the dash saying the system needs service. I really hope they have improved their reliability and that this is just a rare exception. Other than that we love the vehicle so far.

At 1st dealership employee duplicated it rolling backward while in drive (more than once) on a test drive. Chrysler said they’d buy it back, didn’t happen. 2nd dealership did not duplicate it, but did fix other issues such as back up camera coming on and dial gear shift jumping into R while driving on the highway, brakes, and radio with grounding the battery. Dealership managers say their hands are tied by Chrysler, I think their fingers are broken since they don’t return phone calls! This vehicle is an unsafe van that my family and I are stuck with.

The size and the comfort are nice and comparable to the Yukon we had before but all of the technology components are troubled to say the least. The auto sliding door have to be shut at least three time before latching. The radio will freeze for days on end, the auto start feature stopped working, the climate control screen also froze during winter providing no heat for two days. Take it to the dealer and if they can’t recreate the problem they won’t fix anything or replace parts. Yes a pacifica is cheaper but brace yourself for the $15k depreciation in the first six months.

chrysler,pacifica,2018,Bruce, 04/08/2018,Very Bad Driver Seating,3,"I was asked to up dater my review.  Nothing has changed except I like it even less that 6 months ago when I bought it the seat is like sitting on a bag of rocks.  My thoughts at that time were and still are: If I had driven this vehicle for a week before I bought it I would not have bought it.  The front seating is very uncomfortable.  The much touted front 10 way seat adjust every in every direction I don't want to go.  If I could get the second seat passenger seat as the drivers seat it would be great.  The driver seat only has one arm rest on the right side (they built it for a one armed driver I guess).  The seat is like siting on a slab of steel with a scrap of leather on top as a covering.  Living in Florida the leather is very hot all the time and cloth would be a much better choice.  I wanted cloth but could not get it with the other options I wanted.   The ""cooling system"" for the front seats does not do the job and offers only minimum relief.  The driver seat is not good choice if you have to drive long distances of for long periods of time.

Once all the seats are stowed there is enough cargo room for anything we've wanted to load.  Keyless entry and power door operation  are an added bonus. Overall, the vehicle feels high tech with an excellent navigation system and loads of operator conveniences. Interior is quiet during operation and the sound system is amazing.

chrysler,pacifica,2018,TS, 04/27/2019,"Cool van, not a tight ship",2,"I’ve had too many visits to the dealer for strange sounds, creaky suspension,  technology issues, and poor temperature & fog control. While the dealer has said they’re normal sounds, I’ve never heard them in other cars...So, if you like ‘normal’ sounds that don’t instill confidence, have at it. Otherwise, suck it up, get over the inferior looks and maintain the resale value of a Toyota or Honda. Chrysler hasn’t figured this out yet.
UPDATE: It’s been a few more months. The suspension is creaking again, the noise in the front left continues (official response from Chrysler was that this is ‘normal’ - I have yet to find another vehicle that makes this sound so I question the definition of normal).
The sliding doors decide to open back up when closing them from the exterior handle - that’s a new feature. 
So, this car continues to underwhelm. Such a disappointment.
FINAL UPDATE: I got rid of it! MUCH happier with my Sienna! Sucks to have lost the money.

chrysler,pacifica,2018,Lee, 01/12/2019,WORST MINIVAN EVER!!!!!!,1,"This is my 6th Chrysler minivan lease and I've always loved my Town and Country vans.  Chrysler changed to the Pacifica and ruined the entire van.  I will never lease this again and I'm so upset I have another 2 and a half years left with this one.  Shifting gears is a joke the whole car jolts back and forth, you have to make sure you keep your foot on the break when in between gear changes for a K turn or you're rolling back and forth and can hit something.  My van is not even 9 months old and we've had 2 recalls already.  When I get gas the attendant will hand me a receipt for like $28 say its full but the gas light says it's 3/4 full so he tries again and nope, can't put any more gas in it... so something isn't working there.  My husband then took it to try to fill it and the gas spit out at him.  My daughter is going to be able to drive in 6 weeks and now I'm worried about her with the gas situation.  Speaking of the gas, for a short mom forget it don't get this car!!!! when you adjust your seat you can't see the gas tank gauge so once it goes below half a tank you can't see it! I never know I'm low on gas until my gas light goes on!  During every day driving you need to lean forward every time you get in the car to check how much gas you have.  The newly designed controls are one of the worst features also.  The gear shift is now like a radio knob... right NEXT to the radio knob... and right NEXT to the temperature knob!!!! So you have to take your eyes off the road to turn any knob or just fish around blindly until you get to the right knob.  Your brain never actually adjusts to know where things are without looking because they're all the same!!  The screens and controls are also very confusing and require a lot of touches so you really can't adjust while driving, you need to make all adjustments before you pull away unless someone else is in the passenger seat.  The charging ports are so far under the dashboard you have to take your seatbelt off and practically lay on the floor to plug one in.  We have to leave cords in there permanently because forget plugging in while driving or even as a passenger.  The new ""CarPlay"" feature NEVER works right!!  There have been times I've been on a long trip alone or with just one of my kids and I'm using the GPS through CarPlay and it just turns off and on over and over again every 2 minutes, the whole ride.  This was dangerous and scary.  I've missed exits and gotten lost several times because of this.  A few times I had to have my daughter lean up and keep pressing the button every minute when it turned off because I was on a drive that I had no idea where I was going.  Ok auto start is supposed to be a luxury right?  So when it's cold you can start the car from your house so you can go into a warm car... well the heat won't work with auto start! The fan will blow but because the engine isn't on, it's cool air coming out, not the heat!!!!  So you waste your gas and get into a cold car?!?!   Oh and speaking of the engine.. this new feature to save gas that the engine turns off EVERY TIME YOU COME TO A STOP.... what the hell who wants that?????  Seriously the most annoying of all the new ""features"" Yes, you can over ride it.... EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU GET IN THE CAR YOU HAVE TO OVER RIDE IT.  I'm sorry, I have loved my Chrylers for probably 15 years now and I can't believe how much I hate this minivan and I can't wait to get out of this lease.  DO NOT LEASE OR BUY THIS VAN!!!!!!

chrysler,pacifica,2018,cshaws, 02/24/2019,Great Minivan,5,"After 1 year we’ve put on 10,000 miles.  Have had no problems and love this car as much as we did a year ago.  I just love driving this car for the quietness and smooth handling.
All the safety tech is great.  The hide away seats are the greatest for quick flexibility for our 3 dogs and 7 grandchildren.  So easy to reconfigure the seating.  Would never go back to not being able to stow the seats.


Decided to upgrade from our very reliable 2006 Kia Sedona.  After reading all the reviews and awards this van has won decided to give Chrysler another chance after having a 1989 Plymouth Voyager piece of junk. This is a beautiful car in everyway.  We got the tech package with all the safety enhancements ie adaptive cruise, lane change warning, blind spot warning etc.  Its a whole new world from our 2006 Kia.  The fold and stow 2nd row seats are so convenient, heated steering wheel and front and second row seats, sunroof, trim interior is very attractive Rich Brown with black flooring.  Great for our 3 dogs.  We bought a 2018 used that was a rental for 1 year.  Has 29000 miles but saved almost 35% from buying new.  Bought extended warranty  just to be sure everything is covered for next 6 yrs or 103,000 miles.  So far we love it in everyway, but only had it for 3 weeks.  Very happy with the upgrade.  Only thing this doesn't have is the entertainment  package, but we're retired and would never use it.

chrysler,pacifica,2018,SWANEY, 10/24/2019,EXCELLENT VEHICLE,5,"After reading reviews from some owners of the 2018 CHRYSLER PACIFICA, I decided to write a review on my PACIFICA.  I read reviews from a number of owners who had both some major and minor issues with their PACIFICA.  After owning my 2018 PACIFICA for 18 months I have  had no negative issues with the car.  It now has around 14,000 miles on it, and it has been back to the dealer only once and that was for an oil change.  We have owned mini-vans for nearly 20 years and have owned both the HONDA ODDYSEY  and the TOYOTA SIENNA.  Both were excellent vehicles. Once, a number of years ago, we rode in a CHRYSLER TOWN AND COUNTRY.  I felt it was a piece of JUNK!  It took awhile for me to even consider looking at the CHRYSLER PACIFICA.  We chose our PACIFICA with the LIMITED trim level, maroon in color, with the white leather interior.  It has all of the safety features and options that we could possible need.  A couple of weeks ago, we drove from Wisconsin to our winter home in Florida, and according to the onboard computer during the 1,450 mile trip, we averaged 27.5 mpg and that was driving between 75 and 80 mph.  The Stow and Go second row rear seats are excellent.  I personally think that CHRYSLER took all the best features from the HONDA and the TOYOTA and incorporated them into the PACIFICA.  I received a fair trade-in price on my Toyota, plus I received nearly $5,000 in factory rebates and incentives.  I would recommend anyone considering a new mini-van to check out the PACIFICA.

chrysler,pacifica,2018,PacFan, 12/20/2019,"24,000 miles and still love it!",5,"With over 24,000 miles and after a year and half, we couldn't be more pleased with our 2018 Pacifica Touring L Plus.  This is our fifth Chrysler minivan over the last 30 years and the best by far.  Love the quiet ride and almost European-like handling.  Excellent gas mileage.  We have the Sto 'N Go seats folded down for our two dogs' kennels (side by side behind front seats; can easily get dogs out using sliding doors).  Ours has Advanced Safety Tech package with adaptive cruise control, 360 degree birds eye camera, rain sensing wipers, auto high beams and more.  Love how oil filter is on top of the engine.  I use a vacuum oil extractor (suction tube goes down dipstick hole), so changing the engine oil and filter can all be done without having to crawl under the vehicle.  Highly recommend avoid buying any Pacifica that does not have the Advanced Safety Tech option.  Despite buying the lifetime warranty (no longer available from Chrysler), we have not had to take it in once for warranty work.  Yet!!  If the used Pacifica you are considering has been sitting on the lot for a few weeks, it would be best to replace both the main and auxiliary batteries.  Many of the minor electrical gremlins in these vehicles can be traced back to batteries that have not been regularly charged to keep their voltage up."

chrysler,pacifica,2018,Christine R, 04/13/2018,Awkward for short people,3,"The seat position could never be adjusted properly for me to see the side mirrors. I bought it for the blind spot monitor, but I had to turn my head a full 90 degrees to see the mirrors which was unacceptable. The HID headlights were frankly unsafe. Although they were bright, the distinct dark-light boundary and limited forward projection made me feel extremely uncomfortable driving at any speed since I always felt I was ""overdriving"" my visibility. Both of those reasons led me to return the car within a week from buying it. I could not get used to it and took a big financial loss because the car was just awkward and unsafe for me. One of the features that had not been pointed out by the salesman (and had I noticed it I would never, ever have bought it) was the fuel and emissions saving feature during which the car shuts off when idling at a light for more than a second. It starts back up when you take your foot off the brake. This feature could be turned off by a button however it's ""on"" position was the default and you had to do push the button every time you started the car if you wanted to inactivate it. For someone who has always driven old beat up cars, having a car turn off at a light while idling triggered significant anxiety. I would never have considered the vehicle had this happened while test driving it.

Beautiful blue van loaded.
bought new in 2018. Rear carpet replaced 5 times because when you put stow and go seats down it mashes the carpet down.

The next year it overheated  and they replaced the fans. Then the back hatch wouldn't close with button.
Horrible smell coming from defroster.
Several dealers said they couldn't smell it.
  Finally took to clay cooley dodge in Irving Texas.
3 mechanics smelled the stench.
They called me said they did pressure test and other test but couldn't tell what was causing the smell. Said Chrysler would not pay to take out dashboard to determine problem. 
Said it would cost me 1500.00.
Mechanics did great job Chrysler corporation is crap.

Although the stow and go seating is nice, I prefer the second row of seating to be sliding front to rear like in the Kia Sedona. The Kia's sliding seats provides extra space when hauling cargo like bikes and you need to maximize the interior space. The Pacifica's floor to ceiling space is also slightly less than the Kia as well. 

Owned ithe Pacifica for 4 months and have no mechanical or electrical complaints. Overall a great vehicle!

chrysler,pacifica,2018,Kathy K, 12/06/2019,New Chrysler Pacifica,5,"Purchased this 2018 Chrysler Pacifica because I have an older dog that cannot get into a SUV.  I really wanted a SUV, but after the first time I drove this vehicle, I new this was the vehicle for me.  It is standard model and has comfortable seats, backup camera, blind spot warning in the side mirrors.  The price was reasonable and I couldn't be happier.
"
chrysler,pacifica,2018,Nancy, 03/14/2020,Great family car,4,"I love my Chrysler Pacifica Limited and all of the luxury advanced features. The backup split screen with warning beeps makes getting in and out of a tight spot a breeze. The kids love the entertainment system and games and we can even plug in our ROKU for long trips (if you pay a $20 fee for unlimited car wifi through AT&T which is an option with the car). The safety features are great and I like how the battery turns off to recharge at stops. Being able to open and close all the doors is great feature. 

Cons:
1.  The ability to open the sliding doors and trunk by waving my foot has never worked consistently.

2.  Two of the 3rd row seatbelts have torn inexplicably. It could be that the automatic stow feature is slicing the seat belt. This has not yet been recognized as a recall.

3.  It has already had 5 recalls which is an inconvenient pain to get repaired. 

4.  One annoying safety feature that I cannot get to turn off is the speed warning. If I go more than 10 miles over the speed limit, a voice warns me. Often the car thinks that the speed limit is 25 when it is 35mph so I get an unnecessary warning. Also at freeway on-ramps the speed warning is annoying as it is impossible not to accelerate at these moments.

Overall, we love the car and would purchase it again...but not as a brand new one. I'd rather have someone else deal with all the recalls and save my time and money.

chrysler,pacifica,2018,Ca, 05/21/2020,Zippy Dog Limo!,5,"I never thought I’d drive a minivan, but with three large senior dogs I needed something easy for them to climb into and lots of cargo room. The super fast and easy stow-away seats are AMAZING and can’t be found in any other minivan. I love how sporty it looks especially with the black out wheels with polar white body color. The engine is powerful and smooth in all except the most mountainous conditions where is can sometimes be a bit clunky downshifting. I did have an electronic issue with the back door but a computer update solved that quickly. I only wish I could have gotten this in the electric hybrid but its a trade off with the stowaway seats because that’s where they put the batteries.  I’d also be in heaven if they offered this in AWD.

Took it on it's first road trip (out west from Ohio) after the first four months of driving it. Went on a 5000 mile round trip with four adults plus luggage and got 30 (that's right) 30 mpg a few times! ( average 29 mpg)  Taking it on another out west trip in June of 2021. The van let me down one time with a electrical issue when driving it local. Started the van and the wipers came on as did all the lights on the instrument panel plus the engine wouldn't shut off. Had to disconnect battery. Long story short there was a ground wire under the drivers seat that came loose causing all of the chaos. Towed it to the dealership and took the technician 5 ""HOURS"" to find it! Other then that what a great vehicle.

chrysler,pacifica,2018,Marty, 10/29/2020,Don't let the looks suck you in,2,"Van looks good and seems to be on the leading edge of technology. We have the S package that provides blacked out trim, signature leather seats, and black carpet. But all of that is a disguise to the problems you will encounter. Van has been in the shop more times in the last year than our Nissan Quest was in the entire 10 years we owned it. Electrical/Electronics problems, power doors will open after successfully shutting, power doors will just stop and re-open for no reason. Stow away latches broke on first use. Transmission is horrible, been to dealership 3 times for that and they say that all checks out. Even admitted that they sometimes will shift hard or weird. My 90 Mustang with a shift kit and gears didn't shift this hard. Now the latest round is the Auto Start/Stop service unavailable and hood corrosion. The start/stop was due to some auxiliary battery failure. Chrysler is aware of the corrosion on the hoods but requires you to go to a dealership that has a collision/body shop. So the one 5 minutes from my house cannot perform the service. I have also noticed that the climate control sometimes doesn't blow air correctly. Meaning it will be blowing on medium fan speed on A/C even though you adjusted temp so it would slow down. Navigation system is a waste of money. It will tell you its going to take 3 times longer than it really will and will take you a route that is insane. Thank goodness we are leasing and have less than a year left.

chrysler,pacifica,2019,Daddy- O, 01/15/2019,A minivan my wife wants to drive.,5,"We bought the Touring L plus with the s package, 18 inch wheels, sunroof, and advanced safety package.  This is our third Chrysler minivan and the two prior hit 100k mile of driving with it much fanfare.  Our 08 town and country had some pretty significant maintenance while our 14 was solid.  Both vans got the job done.  Trips to the East coast with 3 kids a dog a ski carrier on top and plenty of snow (by the way snow tires for these vans make a huge difference).   No matter what a work mule (horse might be over stating the grace) these vans were, my wife complained bitterly about driving them.  Poor handling and abominable styling.  So when I said we needed to replace the 14 Town and Country, I got a lot of push back against another van.  I have not gotten the wife out of the drivers seat of the new van.  I has great styling.  It has been called a sports van by family.  Handling is much better.  Advanced safety package is super cool and very useful.  Love the sunroof, big light.  Infotainment system is great.  Van is super warm in the winter.   So far this is a great van.  I don’t think a big family can do better.  The big SUVs are a chore to drive.  I have been exhausted on vacations driving them.  The Three row CUVs just don’t have enough storage when filled with people and traveling with luggage.

chrysler,pacifica,2019,L.J. Petrie, 04/04/2019,"So roomy, yet drives like a limo",5,"Edmunds rated Chrysler Pacifica #2 Best Minivan. I read somewhere else that the Pacifica was rated #1 for safety in crash tests. After owning, over the years, several Mercedes, BMWs, Infinity, Porsche, Jeeps, etc. I can honestly say the Chrysler Pacifica is one of the absolute BEST vehicles I have ever owned. Bar none. Our other car right now is a 2018 Lexus and I absolutely prefer the Pacifica in every way. We've taken it up to the mountains, out to the desert, driven it in snow and steep inclines, cross country to Arizona …. not a single problem and it drives like a limo. Huge sunroof. Easy to stow seating (just the push of a button) and it becomes an extremely roomy cargo van. I've taken it to the beach with 2 bikes, 2 surfboards, a kayak, 4 beach chairs and still had room for my spouse, two kids and our dog. Love it!

chrysler,pacifica,2019,jbonn, 01/25/2019,Super so far,5,"We took our new Pacifica up to Vermont, over 800 miles of driving up and back, the day after we picked it up.  It was fabulous.  It handled snow and uneven terrain like an SUV and we were pleased with the mileage considering the size of the vehicle.  The climate control system, which allows the driver and front seat passenger to have their own climates is a real plus, especially for older folks I think.  Front seats are a bit hard, but you get used to them.  They are good on the back though, no pull on the sciatic nerve.  Lots of front row space for bags, cups, keys, everything- which is hard to come back.  Excellent storage throughout the vehicle and the foldngo seats are a dream.  We're very happy with our purchase and would like to recommend Route #1 DodgeJeepChrysler to everyone for their efforts to make this deal a good one.

chrysler,pacifica,2019,Cassie Levy, 05/11/2019,Great Upgrade from a Caravan,5,"I have owned 2 Caravans and wanted an upgrade.  Both Caravans were reliable and never gave me a problem. I bought a Touring L (with several Plus features already installed) 3 months ago and have been very pleased with it. I needed more safety features and ease of opening and closing the rear cargo door. I wanted a nice entertainment package and this came equipped with the larger touch screen and a decent sound system. After using the blind spot detection, I wouldn’t purchase another vehicle without it. I learned with the Caravans to triple check before moving to the right and was still uneasy because of a blind spot in both of them. The only thing I haven’t tried as yet is the automatic parking feature. A little shy on that one. This is my first vehicle with leather seats—I always preferred cloth—but with the heating feature, I have enjoyed them and found them very comfortable. The second row seating is more comfortable than in my Caravan—I have the optional additional seat in the middle that folds down to make an armrest and cup holder. It is very easy to remove if necessary. I considered an Odyssey, but I have come to depend on the stow and go seating in the Dodge and Chrysler products. All in all, I have enjoyed driving this car tremendously.

chrysler,pacifica,2019,Laura, 01/27/2019,Love it hate it!!,3,"Love the comfort, roominess, and reliability of my new van.  Hate the very jerky 9 speed transmission at slower speeds.  The shifting of the lower gears creates a very jerky ride around town.  My radio was already replaced within a week of purchasing.  The vehicle has been into the service dept for the transmission 5 times until I finally took the service foreman for a ride and he stated this is how the 9 speed transmission functions. He also stated Chrysler will hopefully come out with a flash update to smooth out the slower speed shifting.  Amen.  I would wait on buying until this is fixed.  Too late for me.  I have 900 miles on my van and would love to trade in but not at a huge loss!!  Will change review if an update is made.
"
chrysler,pacifica,2019,8Mile, 03/06/2019,Outstanding,5,"This is an excellent vehicle.  I wanted an SUV, and drove the Mazda CX-5, Acura RDX, and Volvo XC60.  I guess minivans aren't ""cool"" anymore, but the Pacifica really stood out -  quieter, roomier, easier to get in and out of, and when the rear seats are folded down into the floor there is a ton of cargo space. Best of all, I took a long trip right after I picked it up, and it just eats up the freeway miles.  It tracks really well, stays on-center, and is a joy to drive.  Visibility all around is excellent. The infotainment system is easier to use than any of the the SUVs that I drove. I've not noticed any issue with the 9-speed transmission that others have noted here and on other sites, my Pacifica is just fine.  The only things to note - and they are minor 1) there is a bit of torque steer when you really jump on it pulling out into traffic, which is to be expected since it's FWD and has a pretty powerful engine; 2) the radio is just OK, I'd go for the top-of-the-line radio if I had a do-over; and 3) the MPG isn't at EPA yet, but I've only had it for a few weeks and I expect it will improve.  One other note - the dealer was fabulous.  I looked at the online price for a similarly-equipped Pacifica at every dealer in the state (and Edmund's recommended pricing), and came in to the dealer with a folder of print-outs, expecting the typical negotiations. I let the sales manager make the first offer, and it was well below the online prices from other dealers. I guess they really wanted to sell a car that day.  In the end the Pacifica was a great value, and is both practical and a joy to drive.

First trip at 300 miles the dealership told me both batteries were bad and replaced them.  Second trip at 500 miles, another dealership said the same, the batteries were dead.  Third trip at 1500 miles, a third dealership said the battery terminals were cracked and replaced them.  Forth trip at 2800 miles, became a major case and the dealership took 31 days to replace the Body Control Module they said was a parasitic leach.

chrysler,pacifica,2019,Wayne, 02/01/2020,She's a beauty!,4,"I'm a bit handicapped and have been looking for something other than a full-size van for a few years now, which can be converted into a mobility vehicle.The problem I have is that my shoulders and hips are still as broad as they were when I was in my prime. Most power chairs are small, by comparison [250 lbs. to 350 lbs.]. My chair weighs in at 525 lbs., indicating that it is wider and taller than other power wheelchairs.

When the Pacifica first hit the market I didn't pay any attention to it - just another Town and Country. I had already ruled out all of the existing minivans. My chair would not fit into any of them. I measured openings and went to mobility dealers in two States without success. On top of it all I still had two problems I continue to have with most cars and trucks these days - they are all designed to fit Asians. My head still scrapes door sill when I get in and once I'm bucxkled-up and on the road, I have to drive with my left shoulder curved up and forward, with a slight twist of my body. I have grown to accept this driving position in modern vehicles.

The only minivan I never looked at, nor had any mobility company tried converting, was the Pacifica. I got the vehicle specs and was pleasantly surprised to find that it appeared to be able to handle my chair and its weight. Of course, I went straightway to the dealer to check this out and discovered that the specs and my measurements were in agreement. ;>)

None of this would matter if I didn't fit in the driver seat. I slipped easily into the seat without having to scunch up, so I wouldn't hit my head getting in. Once the door was closed I still had room between it and my shoulder. YEAH!! I was in heaven! Now for how it performs.

I have had this car for two weeks now and have put on just over 2000 miles. Most of them on freeways over four mountain ranges. Some of it has been through rain, snow, and ice. Overall she has handled very well. Under these conditions I would prefer the AWD of my Toyota Venza over the front-wheel drive of the Pacifica. This would hold true with any car.

She is very stable and nimble in traffic. The blind spot warning system is quite useful. Her engine seems almost as powerful as a supercharged 3.8! I'm impressed! This old man needs to restrain the kid in him from doing a little after-market upgrading. I had heard of problems with the transmission, so I am tuned into those distinctive sounds, and such - nothing yet.

I am still trying to get accustomed to the engine automatically shutting down and turning on again at stops to save fuel. That little noise turning on again often makes me think it's a transmission problem. That's how overly tuned-in I am to the trans issue I've heard about. Yet, no such problem.

The cruise control gives me a little consternation. It's all thumb control on the steering wheel, which is great but the on/off button in the center is to easy to accidentally hit when you are adjusting setpoints or trying to resume speed. It needs to be recessed or moved.

I miss having control of my stereo on my steering wheel. It's a real safety thing for me.

The last thing Ihave a problem with deals with my phone. When I plug it into the USB port it automatically boots up Google Maps, which is fine. Unfortunately, the only way I can use the radio is to unplug my phone, find a station, then plug it in again to continue charging it. Surely, I will find an online owner's manual that will give me further enlightenment.

So far, I'm as happy as a sailor on liberty.

We absolutely LOVE our 2019 Pacifica Limited. We have the advanced safety package and the upgraded 20-speaker Harmon Kardon speakers. The sound quality is fantastic. Just as good as my Lincoln’s Revel system. Ride quality is smooth and quiet. Fast acceleration and excellent braking. Best steering wheel I have ever used. It looks gorgeous and its controls are super easy to use. Tons of leg room in all rows. Unlike the Honda Odyssey, it has a panoramic moonroof and surround view camera. Stow’N Go Seats are the best. Plus, it is the only van that allows you to lean the 2nd row seat forward WITH a child car seat in it so you can still access the back row. The rear UConnect theatre is top in class as well. Well done Chrysler!

chrysler,pacifica,2019,Jim, 04/20/2020,We love it!,5,"We were in the market for a reasonably priced vehicle with updated safety/tech features that had room behind the 3rd row.

The price of large SUVs didn’t appeal to us, and in the minivan market it came down to this and the Odyssey.

The panoramic roof and smooth ride sold us. We now have 9000 miles on it and we love every minute of driving.

In fact, I’ve now inherited my wife’s Lexus GX because she prefers driving the van.

chrysler,pacifica,2019,Jerry, 06/20/2020,A pleasure to drive,5,"I have had this Touring L Pluss Pacifica for 10 months.  When I first began driving it I enjoyed the quiet comfortable ride and the good handling.  I was disappointed by getting only 25 mpg on the highway.  Now I have 14,000 mile on it.  I traveled 300 miles round trip yesterday.  I averaged 30.2 mpg.  This is my seventh Chrysler minivan. The others went well over 100,000 miles with no problems.  One went 250,000 miles and was retired because the body was rusty.  I think that this Pacifica will go on for a long time too.  I traded a 2014 T&C for this one.  The Pacifica is quieter and has all of the safety equipment - lane sense, adaptive cruise control, rain sensing windshield wipers, backup camera with 360 degree view, safety tec, etc. I enjoy the sound system and play my tunes a lot. I blackened  the shiny surfaces on the dash and the chrome on the knobs to prevent glare.  Why does Chrysler insist on putting these shiny surfaces on their vehicles?  Any way,  problem solved. This is one of the best vehicles I have ever owned.

chrysler,pacifica,2019,Texan, 12/02/2019,Over priced for a poor quality product,2,"Test drove both the Odyssey and the Pacifica. The 2nd and 3rd row seats felt inferior quality compared to the Odyssey mainly due to the stow and go feature. Even though the Pacifica felt lighter, was expecting better mileage but the Odyssey was far better in quality and drive ability. Not worth the $35K

chrysler,pacifica,2019,Fredsmom, 10/19/2019,Been talking Chrysler Pacifica is next for 2 years,5,"Do your due diligence to determine if the size, storage, etc meets your needs.  Don’t buy more options than you truly need (or want).  For me, I got the adaptive cruise control, stow away seating, color other than black or another dark color on exterior OR interior, and storage which was at the top of my need list. The would be nice list included various power options, and techie type “toys”.  I found the Pacifica fit the bill perfectly."
chrysler,pacifica,2019,Baron GSD, 09/20/2020,Some disappointment after a year,3,"Don’t let the styling win - make the reliability record, transmission performance, seat comfort for all passengers and resale value guide your decision.  I wasn’t crazy about the Honda’s looks, which led me to buying one.  Chrysler impresses on many fronts with this model, but in its third year    in you’d think they would have worked these problems out.  Both batteries apparently were “bad” and left me stranded three times in one week.  I jumped it twice, myself - which seemed to correct the problem, but the way Chrysler’s electrical system is set up is actually very dangerous.  Technically, there may be enough to turn over the motor, but that’s not good enough.  An auxiliary battery is also required to run the plethora of onboard entertainment gadgets, buttons, whistles, etc.  Imagine going into the store and it’s 102 degrees outside.  You buy groceries and load the vehicle with groceries.  You get in and attempt to start.  The transmission gear selector does not light up and it says Vehicle must be in park to start.  No matter what you do, the vehicle remains in accessory mode from that moment forward until the battery is drained completely dead (unless you disconnect at battery terminal).  You cannot turn the vehicle off, but you cannot get air conditioning either.  You are stranded, but cannot leave a vehicle with dash lights all ablaze.  It’s infuriating.  But just wait - it gets worse, too because you’ll spend literally hours trying to get the worthless company that handles Chrysler’s Roadside Assistance to first answer, then after four attempts to secure a tow to a dealer I finally gave up in disgust and called a tow truck and paid $100 to tow in for a warranty battery replacement, which took the dealer the entire next day to diagnose and replace.  I was told good luck in trying to get Chrysler to reimburse the tow cost.  Very unimpressed with this low level of customer service.  Transmission is annoying sometimes.  Cruise control does not maintain speed often - and if you’re not paying attention could get you into trouble.  Hasn’t Chrysler had this rap before?  Like in the late 90’s?  Building style-forward automobiles, that perform well, but fall apart and don’t measure up after the sale?  Fiat, if this is your MO, too the Chrysler brand won’t last much longer.  Was hoping for better, but just more of the same.  Get the Honda!!!

chrysler,pacifica-hybrid,2017,cawwilson, 05/18/2017,Still haven't filled up,5,"We've put 800 miles on our new van and have yet to fill the tank up from the full tank that the dealer provided. The van takes approximately 12 hours to fully charge on a 120V wall outlet and will travel 40 miles solely on electricity. This is basically as far as we travel in a days time for preschool, groceries, friends, and errands. Once you run out of battery the gasoline engine kicks in however, it is so subtle that you cannot even feel or hear the difference. The interior rivals that of a high end luxury vehicle and the technology is second to none. We can even remote start the van through an app on our smartphones! The trip computer is telling me that we are averaging 48 MPG on the gas engine, so even if you run out of electricity the van is extremely fuel efficient due to the hybrid technology. This is my first Chrysler product that I've ever owned, but I'm seriously thinking about buying another after owning this for a month. This is the ultimate family hauler, and I'm so glad that I waited for this van instead of going ahead with an Odyssey or Sienna. Don't think twice, just buy this van!

chrysler,pacifica-hybrid,2017,Roumen, 05/17/2017,Welcome to the future,5,"You charge it at home for 2 hours and drive 33 miles on electric battery power. If you read this in about 5 years, this may not be news to you, but now it is great news. Ride in comfort short or long trips. Parks itself. Accelerates and brakes itself, even warns you if you have a car close by, in front, behind, on the side. Get close to the line and it will pull your wheel in. I know, right, future man? It has been now more than 2 years since we bought it, we drive it every day, charge it, drive it, charge it... We put gas in only when we take a road trip. Very quiet even with gas engine on, I guess because of the active noise cancellation. Vented seats save our asses in the desert. We had to purchase a spare tire set and only load it in the back (there is no dedicated space) when we go on longer trips. Don't buy the in-car WiFi, it is slow 3G, your phone is better. The sliding door is temperamental, does not close each time, the assembly behind the rear view mirror unglued from the glass, you can hear some squeaks of the rubber seals when driven on rougher roads. When the lead batter goes dead, no usual car guy workaround works, the car must be taken to the dealership and multiple computers reset, which means that the tow truck has to take it there. You can run the weekly store supply with the car in the day and take your daughter to the prom in the evening.

chrysler,pacifica-hybrid,2017,john h, 01/03/2018,I love this car,5,"The car isn't really a hybrid - even in city driving the gas engine kicks in; the hybrid charge discharges fairly quickly; I also own a Prius and the hybrid battery charges during driving, not so for the Pacifica; instrumentation technology is superb - when I bought the car I didn't remember that the light switch was on the dash - I touched the screen, scrolled to the info icon and entered ""lights"" and the screen displayed the page - very user friendly; all of the features are easy to follow - heat, heated seats, heated steering wheel, etc.; the vehicle accelerates quickly; the middle seats are easily removed (if necessary); it's fun getting used to the automatic settings - rain sensing wipers, dimming headlights; navigation works great; height challenged people may have difficulty getting in from the outside; my wife feels that the legroom in the second row is somewhat tight; I am the main driver so I cannot speak to the comfort of passenger seat, second row seat, or third row; have had the car only 2,000 miles, so am still learning and experiencing the many features of this car; should have had windows tinted; haven't driven the car enough miles yet to determine mpg, and other information - reliability, rain/snow, mechanical; usually drive about 24,000 per year between both cars;
THIS is now July - I use the car mostly for local driving (at the moment); I put gas in the minivan on January 25, drove 1051 miles through April 24, and filled the pacifica again with 9.52 gallons MEANING that the average was 110 miles per gallon, very few of the miles were more than 30 miles round-trip, most were 10 miles round-trip; since April 24, I have driven 840 miles, the gas gauge is still above 1/2 full; I use the charging cord that came with minivan, and charging takes a long time (after returning from errands I charge the vehicle which takes about 2 hours to fully charge 100% from 88%; our electric bill to charge the pacifica has not increased significantly; I enjoy driving this vehicle and am enjoying learning more about its features and accessories; I am glad that I made the purchase.

chrysler,pacifica-hybrid,2017,Rick Dunemn, 02/01/2018,bigproblems with the 2017 Chrysler Pacifica hybrid,2,"We purchased our new 2017 Chrysler Pacifica hybrid new in January 2017, from the dealer. It's delivery was delayed because of a safety recall while it was in transit and it has been in the shop for nine out of the last 12 months with parts being unavailable. Dealership works great with us, but the problem is with the Chrysler support team. it's as though Their belief is if you ignore The problem long enough it'll go away, the entertainment system has been down for the last six months with parts unavailable. Sliding doors will open when car is placed into park, liftgate does not want to stay open, blind spot indicators are intermittent, power windows are intermittent, transmission does not want to come out of parking gear, cannot adjust brightness of the dash lightsor the interior lights. These are just a few of the many problems we've had with the 2017 Chrysler Pacifica hybrid! This minivan was on national safety recall from June 5 Until September 13, and It's Sat on dealers lot for four months because Parts were unavailable from Chrysler during this time it was deemed to be unsafe to drive by the federal government! Car stoped running on the freeway, but the bright side is that if the car is not running then this really improves the gas mileage. initiated lemon law lawsuit, Chrysler has offered to replace it with a 2018 Pacifica hybred but under their terms we will lose almost $4000 in the deal.

chrysler,pacifica-hybrid,2017,Andrea, 11/03/2017,Great vehicle so far...,4,"We love the room that is in this vehicle and the third row seats going flat for storage or transporting big items. The Mopar voice connect is not great often not recognizing what you say and navigation is a bit off when compared to navigation with your phone. Don't get or add the Mopar wireless charging station as it requires you to then get a new case for your phone for it to work, they offer one free but then you would pay around $45 for another case unless you wanna switch back n fourth with you spouse. Second is that the cases only work or fit specific phone types and we have Moto G phones and they won't work. It just isn't worth it and the charging plate is far down on the floor of the car, honestly it is easier to just plug in with a USB cable. I love the triple pane sun roof, get it if you can, the hands free opening of doors is great. Not sure on cost savings for hybrid charging vs. just gas usage. With the included 110v charger it does take about 13 hrs to fully charge and gives you about 30 miles. The third row back seat could be a bit cramped for longer legs except for the middle seat. My 3 yr old likes the video aspect but it is too hard for him to reach controls for the other touch pad options on it unless we move the seat forward but then his legs get smooshed against the back of the front seat. If you can, order urs from factory with the 18"" rims etc because if you want to switch from 17's to the 18's after the fact it will cost about $425 per rim alone to do then you have to buy new tires too! I love sirus xm, nice but spotty coverage in areas so just beware. I am sure there is more but we just got this van 2 weeks ago.

chrysler,pacifica-hybrid,2017,Jim, 12/08/2017,Don't rely on Invoice pricing today,5,"Most dealers did not want to sell at invoice, which means nothing anyway as it was a little over $100 less than MSRP.  Difficult to know actual cost in this day as dealers are paid based on monthly volume sold but I was able to find a dealer willing to sell the hybrid at what they called employee pricing.  That worked out to a little over $3k off MSRP so made the leap and purchased.

chrysler,pacifica-hybrid,2018,Tony Bifulco, 02/25/2018,EVERY DAY IS A THRILL,5,"I can almost get by every day with a charge from the level one charger and not use gasoline. I go weeks at a time without stopping for gas and average 75-80 mpg local driving. Using a/c and heat cuts down on the mileage. The electronics makes you aware of maintenance needs and cars performance. The second row of seats pop out and with the third row down i fit 2 twin mattresses and box springs and frames with room to spare. My only glitch seems to be the control panel screen goes out occasionally and I have not had it back for service yet to get it checked out . Would liked to have had the memory on front seat position. The driver assist features are great. I don't see any significant change in my electric bill.

chrysler,pacifica-hybrid,2018,hamptona, 03/05/2018,I Love this Vehicle!,4,"This car is a parent's dream. It is stylish, comfortable, easy to fit 4 kids, has an amazing sunroof, handsfree sliding doors, great cargo space, beautiful seats, fuel efficient, and easy and pleasant to drive. The electronic Uconnect system is awesome... when it is working.  My car is just a few months old and the Electronic screen is ""glitchy"".  It freezes, leaving me with a crying toddler, that his ""show is not working.""  Chrysler put out a system update, but no change for us.  The dealer is stumped. I love this car, but am beginning to regret the purchase. Don't you buy a new car so that you can avoid the service department?  Sooo inconvenient.

Update 3/2020
We have had the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid for about 2.5 yrs now. I L.O.V.E this vehicle.  The UConnect issue is now fixed, no thanks to the dealer. Chrysler automatically updates the software somehow and it is now working correctly. Occasionally it will glitch, but then I just turn it off and turn it back on and it is resolved. We have 3 kids and the automatic doors are fantastic. No pulling on a heavy trunk door, just push a button. Just love all the hands free options. The seats are great and the flexibility of the third row is ideal. I can't remember what interior colors were offered when we built the car, but I would not choose black again for the carpet. It shows too much. I would rather tan or brown. Our seats are a light grey and they don't really show dirt and look great. The navigation system is good, but I usually plug in my phone and use Android auto. etc. I love not having to go to the gas station but once every couple months. We also have a Tesla, which is the bomb... as a mom who occasionally forgets to plug in the car, having the gas tank in the Pacifica as a back up is nice. Once you get the habit down of plugging in, I rarely forget, unless I park in a different spot at the house. I really really like our Pacifica and think it is the best family car.

chrysler,pacifica-hybrid,2018,Paul W., 11/30/2017,2018 Pacifica Hybrid Pros & Cons,4,"First items posted below are new.
The intermittent tail gate failure to close was finally resolved with replacement of the tail gate actuator. 
(New 1) - Like many new cars the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid does not have a spare tire.  The tire size on the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid is not stocked by most tire stores and if not repairable they can be very expensive.  A tire failure can ruin a vacation or even a trip to the store.  There is no room to carry a spare.
(New 2) - when plugged in and charging at the higher rate with a 240 volt charger be prepared for a periodic loud fan noise under the hood when the battery/electronic cooling system fans turn on.  Sounds like a jet in our garage.
(New -3) - Tail gate on occasion stops and reopens when closing.  Dealer reduced frequency with a tail gate calibration however the fail to close still randomly occurs.
Original posts:
(1) The biggest concern - will the 2018 Pacifica Hybrid be eligible for the $7500 federal tax credit?  As of today the government website, https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/taxevb.shtml   shows only the 2017 model with a tax credit.  The dealer misled us if we don't get the tax credit.  Update below - we did get the federal and state credit.
(2) No driver memory seat even in the Limited model - pain when drivers need different seat & mirror settings
(3) The ""REAL"" hybrid mpg once the stored electric charge is depleted after ~35 miles, is ~30 mpg with a mix of freeway and city
(4) Tailgate opening height is not adjustable like the Odyssey - tailgate intentionally opens high for tall people and will likely hit the garage door when parked inside and then automatically close
(5) Many of the controls are embedded in the display - in some cases would have preferred actual switches
(6) The 120 volt charger that comes with the car will take 14 hours to charge fully depleted batteries.  Will need to spend ~$600 for a 240 volt level 2 charger and have someone do the wiring for a quick 2 hour charge. 
(7) Very limited on storage compartments.
(8) Mixed reviews on the 3rd row seat head rests and access.  
(9) The driver seat is not comfortable for short folks, edge of seat hits in the back of the knee joint
(10) The U-Connect display has failed 8 times in two months, so far display recovers after ignition is turned off for a period of time.  Failure modes include (2x) totally blank non-functional screen (ironically back-up camera display still works), (1x) back-up camera locked on and did not turn off when driving, (1x) vertical blue and white strips - could see icons but couldn't select, (4x) display asked for radio security code blocking rest of display. 
THE GOOD:
(1) Handles well, nice interior and exterior design
(2) Looks like we will get the CA environmental $1500 rebate and qualify for a CA green HOV sticker
(3) UPDATE 7/2018 - We received the Federal $7500 tax credit, a CA environmental $1500 rebate check, $400 from SCE and the HOV sticker.  
(4) UPDATE 7/2018 - After multiple visits to Chrysler dealers and communicating with the Chrysler U-Connect rep - after 6 months Chrysler replaced our radio which had been frequently failing.  Chrysler installed a refurbished replacement radio and we have had no further problems.  In addition Chrysler gave us a reasonable cash compensation for our inconvenience with the radio.

chrysler,pacifica-hybrid,2018,Bob, 04/08/2018,Better than expected but not perfect,5,"I replaced my 2005 Chrysler T&C Limited with a Pacifica Hybrid Limited. With the federal and Colorado tax credits and the mfg. and dealer discounts the car only costs me a total of $310 per month on a 36 month lease. With gas savings its even better. So to be honest the purchase was mostly financial. However the vehicle is much better than I anticipated. The electric only performance is excellent. The car weighs 600 lbs more than my old T&C but actually feels lighter, more responsive, and quicker. A delight to drive. The car is very quiet but road/tire noise and ride quality are similar to my old T&C (which is good). Wind and engine/transmission noise are non existent.  Handling and acceleration are much better. Its impressive that they were able to improve the handling while not degrading the ride quality. A Level 2 charger is a must though (15+ hours vs. 2.5 hours to charge). So you need to install 240 volt service in your garage (added cost). The seats are a little to firm (my 2005 T&C front seats are more comfortable). The lack of Stow-N-Go 2nd row seats is a noticeable loss but an acceptable trade off. The dial shifter is awkward as is the Homelink in the visor (minor issues). The interior is quite luxurious (not a good as a German car but good) The touch screen is very good and the various entertainment and driving aids are excellent. The 33 mile electric range (I've actually gotten better) with a Level 2 charger covers 90% of my driving so its almost as good as a pure electric with the benefit of being able to drive long distances. And it can carry a 4x8 sheet of plywood! The combination of luxury, utility and efficiency(and eco-friendly) can't be matched by any other vehicle. If they fixed the few issues mentioned above and increased the electric range to 50+ miles this vehicle would be perfect.

chrysler,pacifica-hybrid,2018,Lori G, 06/09/2018,Buggy / Bad Interface Design,2,"We bought the hybrid Pacifica 6 months ago. We had never owned a Chrysler before and were a little nervous about that, but it was the only pluggable hybrid minivan on the market. That's really the only thing we like about the vehicle. We've had lots of what seem to be software bugs - inability to turn off climate control, Uconnect theater screen goes black (video player unusable), software upgrade errors, screens locked, prompting to re-enter anti-theft code again and again, etc. We called the dealer and they were unhelpful. My advice is to wait until a better car maker has an option.

chrysler,pacifica-hybrid,2018,YY, 09/17/2018,Best minivan out there,5,"OK, we are a minivan family.  We just don't see why a family of 5 should get anything other than minivans.  Previously we leased a 2012 Honda Odyssey touring.  That worked well but near end of lease we had transmission problem.  So we did not keep it beyond our lease. Then we leased a 2016 Kia Sedona SX.  At the time, we felt that was only available minivan with all the tech (adaptive cruise, blind spot, auto high beam) and yet a 8 seater.  Was super-reliable.  Would have kept it but it had poor resale value - in fact the buy out was more than the actual value of the car so we passed.  We just started leasing a 2018 Pacifica Hybrid Limited.  A $50K car - fully loaded, but with all the rebates and dealer discounts it was substantially cheaper (~$35K).  This is the most awesome car not only in terms of value, but also of its quality interior, ride and overall refinement.  Drives the first 30 miles in super quiet electric mode.  We only need to get gas when we go out of town.  The only complaint is 1) no driver seat memory (a pain - as we are used to his/hers seat settings; 2) no auto foldable mirror - for parking in tight garages; 3) lift gate not adjustable - I had to place foam on the back of the garage door to prevent the gate from smashing into the open garage door; 4) uncertain reliability (I see all the complaint about their Uconnect theater system - but ours has performed flawlessly); 5) uncertain resale value (but it is much more discounted to begin with - significantly cheaper than a comparably equiped Honda Odyssey Elite).

Update: March 2020 - only issue so far driver side automatic sliding door seem to not want to close completely - acting as if there is an obstacle and would then reopens - need to push button again to get it closed; gas tank would stop the pump way before tank was full and i had to repeatedly get it to go to fill the tank up completely (now I just leave the car ""on"" and observe the tank indicator) - fortunately not need to fill tank frequently due to mostly using electric.  Otherwise the car is still great - very happy about the purchase.

chrysler,pacifica-hybrid,2018,KK, 05/08/2018,U Connect theater systems corrupted,1,"A few months ago, we purchased the 2018 hybrid pacifica limited brand new, fully loaded, $50k.  The U connect theater system has not worked since we purchased the vehicle.  The dealership was unable to fix the corrupted system, and we were told there was no fix available.  I was told ALL of the 2018 theater systems have this issue, and that my system could not be replaced or repaired.  So, I am stuck with a brand new vehicle with a theater system that does not work, and even under warranty could not be fixed.  I spoke to several Chrysler representatives, spent countless hours on the phone, and the customer service was horrible.  Had I known that Chrysler does not uphold their warranty guarantees on their VERY expensive systems, I would have bought a different vehicle.

chrysler,pacifica-hybrid,2018,Rose M Brethen, 09/17/2018,Two strikes,3,"We traded our 2013 Ram 1500 Laramie Longhorn 4x4 for the 2018 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid. Loved everything about it until the first check engine light at 8 days old with 450 miles on it.  The same check engine light codes continued to come on.  The dealer would reset them and were unable to resolve the problem. They finally Involved Chrysler engineering and still couldn’t resolve the issue. They suspected a software issue with they battery charging system. It was 1 of 3 in the nation at the time. Chrysler bought it back and we replaced it with the same vehicle different color. At 450 miles the same problem occurred with the 2nd van. Same software issue.  Bottom line, in 10 weeks we spent 51 days in 8 different loaners, spent 60 plus hours of our time, several thousand dollars, plus untold time on the phone. This has also had an unfavorable impact on our credit. After all was said and done, Chrysler bought the 2nd van back as a lemon. We replaced it with a 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee Trailhawk that we are very pleased with.

chrysler,pacifica-hybrid,2018,D.P., 09/20/2018,"An expensive toy at $50,000",1,"I used the car for one week and then it would not start anymore. There is a switch inside the hybrid battery that got stuck in the open position. Current could not flow back to the power train. I had to use a towing to send it back to the dealer. Remember a brand new car. Turns out that the whole hybrid battery had to be replaced. The repair took one month. According to the dealer, Chrysler-Detroit was trying to find the best route to fix the problem without replacing the hybrid battery. But one month? This is a strange situation considering that this is a brand new car with less than 400 miles. It seems to me that this is pinpointing to a design flaw. I filled the tank completely before the car stopped working. Gas was available. Why not shutting down the hybrid system when it stops working and go to 100% gas power train? What if the bug had occurred on the highway while I was driving? Not a pleasant thought. I bought the Chrysler Pacifica Limited for the extended security package which is quite impressive. However the basic security, a running car, is not warranted. We were planning to make long distance travels with this car. What if that sort of problem occurs while I visit Canada or any national park in the middle of nowhere? I bought a new car exactly to avoid reliability problems. This is a car designed to be driven in cities and suburbs where road assistance is easily provided. I wanted a tool. It looks like I got a toy, an expensive one.

Update: After multiple unsuccessful attempts to get my car fixed it became evident that the dealer did not have the necessary expertise. I used the lemon law and got a refund.

chrysler,pacifica-hybrid,2018,Anthony, 12/07/2018,Beauty is only skin deep,2,"I am proud to have taken the leap into the realm of electric plug-in vehicles. I was ready to step away from gasoline only vehicles but knew I was taking a chance at buying the Pacifica hybrid when it’s only been out less than a year since the first major recall that removed it from the market.  I was hoping that buying the re-introduced model would have resolved any problems. But since ownership there have been already two recalls. My rearview camera has very odd color rendition especially transitioning from the garage and entering day late. I frequently get a message on my infotainment system to enter a security code to unlock the radio. Most recently  after charging in my garage all night. The hybrid van did not start accessories worked but the vehicle would not start. I had to tow it to the dealer. They have been unable to reproduce the problem after three days. I currently have 10,000 miles on the vehicle. I am quite unnerved that source of the problem has not been found. I predict I will take possession of my vehicle again without this problem being resolved. I expect to wait for the van to stop running or fail to start either in my garage or worse, hundreds of miles away on a road trip. My trust and faith in this Chrysler product is seriously a question. My kids love the seats and comfort and are oblivious to the electrical problems! Interestingly, the installed interactive screens are used by kids to connect their devices to watch movies, youtube, etc.

chrysler,pacifica-hybrid,2018,Jim, 10/14/2018,Unbelievable!,5,"We are now approaching 5 months of ownership. Nothing - nothing - disappoints on this terrific Plug-In Hybrid. The $40,000 + price tag is nothing to sneeze at, but thanks to the $7500 Federal Tax Credit its much less of an issue. And kudos keep coming in from expert reviewers to support my perspectives on build, quality and value. For example, check this out from CNBC published November 16, 2018: https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/autos-hybrids/the-2018-chrysler-pacifica-hybrid-is-the-best-family-car-you-can-buy/ar-BBPCAvA Honestly, this is probably the best overall vehicle we've ever owned and that stable includes Honda (1), Toyota (1) and Lexus (2).

chrysler,pacifica-hybrid,2018,Todd, 12/14/2017,Nice Van,4,"Classy interior, minivan exterior.  Traded a Toyota Sienna that I had for 6 years for this.  Immediately noticed how much less space is available behind the 3rd row (still much more than any crossover/SUV) and how nice the long sliding middle row seats were in the Sienna.  Also miss the dual glove boxes, the amount of space in the center console, 4 one-touch express windows and the 3rd row venting windows (these are more minor inconveniences to me that I'll get used to not having).  Other than those few items, the Pacifica Hybrid is a great vehicle.  Hard to believe it is only 6 years newer than the van it replaced as the technology is unbelievable.

chrysler,pacifica-hybrid,2018,Jerry Gentes, 08/06/2018,"2 years, 10 months - 62,000miles - still LOVE it!",5,"Update at 2 yrs, 10 mos: 62,000 miles.  Runs great, no recall issues in past 2 years.  During stay at home time (COVID-19 etc.), I didn’t need gas for 2 months while putting on up to 30 miles a day for errands in town - all electric.  Chrysler needs more ads to help people understand what a game changing vehicle this is.
Original: Edmund’s got one thing wrong on their review.  The 2nd row seats DO slide front and back - 5 positions in all.  The only gripe on the seats is the cushioning is a bit firm.  (Still love the seats in our 2001 T&C Limited the best!).  But, after 20,000 miles, I LOVE this van.  It gets awesome gas mileage!  Just drove from IL to MA - 1160 miles - 32.8 mpg!  I got 29 miles, at highway speeds, from the initial electric charge, but could not charge the battery after that.  It still ran over 100 miles on electric (!), using brake regen and coasting down hills.  It is all automatic - I just drive!  (First 10,000 miles, highway MPG was around 27.5.  At about 13,000 miles it appeared to be well broken in and began seeing 32-33 mpg highway consistently.). Also, love the Adaptive cruise control - makes stop and go slowdowns due to construction a breeze.  And we decided to bring along two trim recliner chairs, 40” high.  No problem!  Stow the rear seat in the floor with a couple hand pulls, and the chairs both fit easily leaving 4 seating positions with luggage room.  I have had some issues with recalls, but all have been handled by my Chrysler dealer with minimal hassle.

chrysler,pacifica-hybrid,2018,C.R., 10/02/2018,Saving gas is not worth risking your life!,1,"5 day old 2018 hybrid Pacifica with 250 miles loses braking and power steering when engine stalls during a three point turn. Car was headed towards curb with pedestrians. Braking felt mushy at stop sign before but became unresponsive while in turn. Standing on brakes and cranking steering wheel still led to hitting curb to come to a stop. Fortunately traveling at a very slow speed. Car left family stalled with oncoming traffic on both sides. Attempted restart for 2-4 minutes while traffic continued to back up on both sides continually an increasingly dangerous situation. Car restated. Had car towed to dealership. Too terrified to drive it.

chrysler,pacifica-hybrid,2018,St.Cloud, 11/02/2018,UFO Mothership with Zero Inertial Drive,5,"Amazing minivan, it's almost comical that the van is getting way better MPG than my compact cars. Saves time, less frequent visit to the pump which almost always needed at the least opportune time (eg. rushing to airport, work, dr. apptment etc). The 6 cyl ICE engine is also velvety smooth, can't say the same about 1st gen Chevy Volt and Ford CMax, engines - too underpowered in the later, which means the they're noisy when driven on hilly road. A great way to save the environment, if you have kids and haven't been thinking about the greenhouses and the havoc it's wrecking in the world, then shame of you. At the same time this is way more practical than pure BEV, which runs into issues doing road trips ie. ICEd chargers, broken chargers, long wait time, charge taper off etc., etc. In the city which's 80-90% of your driving, it'll run purely on electric. Runs 100% electric for my commute, charge at home and at work. Savings at the wallet? Don't just look at the gas vs electric bill, consider the brake pads that you save, the less frequent trips to the dealers for oil change. If nothing else consider that slash and burn agriculture saves a ton of money too, may even lower food prices, at least at the beginning that's until the chicken comes home to roost. If the cost isn't prohibitive to you, do the right thing, your kids and grand kids will thank you later..

chrysler,pacifica-hybrid,2018,Dr. T Rex, 05/31/2018,A game changer,5,"The Pacifica Hybrid is the first all new vehicle from FCA, and it shows in spades.  This van is a joy to drive. Limousine like comfort with all the doodads. I purchased the subtle red with a beautiful mocha interior that rivals any luxury car.  The seats are perfect for the mid size male. The height adjustment for the drivers seat barely suffices for the 5ft tall female driver.  The lack of a memory drivers seat is a minor nuisance. The visibility is superb for such a large vehicle.  The driving dynamics and the hushed sound levels and the comfortable ride make it the ideal vehicle for the over 65 tweeters who schlepp around their 90 year old parents as well as their adult children and grand children. The EVT transmission and the range blow away the gas only version. You will need to install a level 2 charger in your garage to get the most out of this vehicle.  I am getting 34 mpg in combined city and highway driving. The infotainment system is second to none. I think this vehicle is a game changer and puts Chrysler back on the map. A great Uber Black Vehicle if one is so inclined. I am 65 and this is probably the last vehicle I will purchase. It exudes competence, excellent build quality, esthetics and comfort. Forget the snobby SUV. You do not have to be a vehicle snob to see the relevancy of this vehicle for everyday chores or the long distance road trip with your extended family.  Kudos to Chrysler.

We live in a mid sized city and all of our errands have been on pure electric.  I have to say that the car handles in electric mode extremely well.  You pay a premium for this van but you are getting an excellent car with mind boggling gas mileage.  Overall, we are super happy with it.

When in reality, if you add a towing package, it voids the power train warranty.

chrysler,pacifica-hybrid,2018,Bern, 12/28/2018,Very happy but has some questions.,4,"Let me start by saying this van is great. But I'm not getting the promised 30+ miles on full charge. I average about 20-25 even at the best most efficient driving (not going past 55 mph). I tried everything, no A/C, no heater, no radio but the best I could get is about 25. My drive unfortunately everyday averages 30 which is why I jumped into getting Pacifica. I am using an installed level 2 charger which works well. It however stops at 80% charging and there is no setting I can force charge the van to 100%. The level 2 charger (indicating 80% charge) is consistent with the 20-25 mile range it actually does. The van LCD panel and light indicator shows 100% charge though. But the performance range is definitely in the low 20 miles. I may have to bring it to the dealer to be checked.

For 6 months (Mar thru Aug 2018) we never visited the gas station and got 75 MPGe on average.  This is Prius level economy in a 5000 pound, 7 passenger vehicle that drives like a dream in electric mode: quiet, responsive & extremely comfortable!   During our 500 mile vacation trip in Sep we averaged 33 MPG in hybrid mode. Chrysler deserves to be selling a lot more of these.

chrysler,pacifica-hybrid,2018,Rod Howard, 01/25/2020,Parts take forever,3,"While we love the van it has spent more than a month in the shop in just over a year of ownership. Almost all of the time is waiting for parts to be available. 
Bought this van late in 2018, it is a very nice car, likely the most comfortable car we have ever had and our very first van. After a month  I went out in the garage to find the floor covered in antifreeze, got it into the shop to find it had a cracked radiator. After a few days it was fixed and all was well. Fast forward to December of 2019 and the heat goes out and an engine light comes on right before Christmas, got it into the shop where they took a full day running diagnostic finally saying they found a loose connection tightened it and all was fixed. A few days after Christmas we are in the road with kiddos heading 6 hours away to visit family for the holidays, we are a few hours from home when the heat goes out again and the engine light comes on. We keep going without heat for the trip and get it into the shop on January 4, 2020 right after we got back into town. That was three weeks ago now and the shop finally left a message today that they got the parts to fix the heat and the heat was working.  They also said it did not clear the code and needed another part and that I should have my new van back in one more week. So if I finally get my van back next week it will have been in the shop for close to 5 weeks in just 15 months of ownership, very sad.
I would think Chrysler would look to have amazon do their distribution as they seem to be able to get about anything one could want delivered in a matter of days."
chrysler,pacifica-hybrid,2018,Jim, 04/01/2020,Kuestionable Kuality,3,"We bought the van at the end of 2018 to get the tax incentive, not a rebate! The van was an early 2018 build and the last one in the dealer inventory. I should have looked closer as this one was full of defects. Check engine light while being while in prep; they reset it saying it was because of the gas cap. (it's part of the fuel door) After a few days, light on again. 4 days in shop for isolation valve. Then the clunking started;, in the doors and front suspension, the dash had a defect that they said I might have done. they performed service on the wheel bearings and couldn't find the door noise. The 'bearing' got worse during the first road trip. The front strut was replaced. They ordered a new dash cover after it started to bubble in a different area. I couldn't schedule battery charge time; exterior trim misaligned and hard to fill gas tank to full are some more problems. They fixed the charge problem, but there are still rattles/clunking/popping noises coming from the doors and got another check engine light. It was an engine stall, light was reset.
The van drives nice, quiet and gets great mileage. The first year I only drove it 9000 mi. 18+ days in shop.

chrysler,pacifica-hybrid,2018,Krishna puttagunta, 05/21/2019,Awesome vehicle with safety and fuel efficiency,4,"I was driving 2016 BMW X3 and bought this van few days back. So far, the acceleration on electric and hybrid is amazing . The electric torque gives a good feeling of quick acceleration and did not get the feel that I am driving a big van. I bought new 2018 Pacifica limited and based on my two days of driving , I am getting 33 miles per full charge of battery and switched to gas. You may get bit more engine noise and lag in torque in hybrid mode initially but after some time it smoothens out and vehicle performs fine. I am yet to check fuel estimate on hybrid mode . Regarding the safety features, they work great. The lane assist smoothly glides your vehicle into lane and you don’t have to stress out much to keep the vehicle within lane like I used to do with bmw , similarly the camera and park sensors are of great help parking , taking out of garage and checking surrounding especially when in school. I even had active breaking come on and save me from colliding during my travel on busy highway . The pain point so far is that the side view mirrors don’t have electronic folding options and you have to fold them manually, it is pain to do so when taking in and out of my garage . Other problem I had was that the I forgot to close cap for plugin point and vehicle did not warn me and when I backed out from garage this cap got scratched on side wall. So far the vehicle is great for my daily commute of 38 miles

chrysler,pacifica-hybrid,2019,Ron, 02/02/2019,The van exceeded our expectations,5,"We needed a great deal more room to tote our various bits and pieces of sports equipment - some of it long and heavy.  We also wanted to dip our toes in the chargeable car market - but because we often travel off the beaten path we didn’t want to go all electric.  The Pacifica Hybrid Limited met all of our needs and then some.  It is stylish, beautifully assembled, quiet, easy to drive, smooth running and technologically advanced!  Because we have been able to use public chargers during our last few outings our combined electric/gas mileage is approaching 54!  That’s right, 54 mpg!  We fully expect, however, when it warms up (and we are using the AC) and are traveling to places without chargers and thus using the gas engine entirely our mileage will fall toward the 30’s.  Running hybrid we get about 30-32 mpg.  Still pretty amazing for a car this size and weight.  There are so many features in this car I cannot list them all here - things like regular cruise control and adaptive cruise control; front seats that bend forward to permit easy access; rain sensing wipers; auto-dimming mirrors; folding mirrors; the amazing  Uconnect system, etc!!!  We love it and got just what we wanted.  And a $7,500.00 tax credit to boot!

chrysler,pacifica-hybrid,2019,Jason L, 10/14/2018,Amazed more people don't buy....whats not to like?,5,"We have always had big 4WD vehicles like Yukon XL Denali, Suburban, or Navigator but recently moved to the Pacific NW and no longer needed the 4WD.  My wife was 100% against a minivan, and we were shopping for a newer SUV but with gas more expensive up here and on the way up, we were looking at midsize SUVs where the 3rd rows were not up to previous expectations.  We didn't want a car payment so I didn't want to spend too much.  I got her to look at a new 2018 Odyssey and she loved it after the drive, however typical car lot tactics made us run away from the dealer (I have bought probably 20 new vehicles, most never setting foot in except to sign paperwork when deal was done).  She decided she liked the Pacifica look better, but I was vary wary of buying a Chrysler product due to resale....look at one of their vans after a year on the gas side.  I told her if we were going with Pacifica, it was going to be the Hybrid because she does a lot of city driving where the 33 mile electric range would be optimal and with the 7,500 tax credit a limited hybrid was actually cheaper than a gas limited.  We drove 6.5 hours to find a deal on one and drove it back home.  The outside look is pretty please for a minivan.  The inside is top notch, everything inside is surprisingly great..very functional and comfortable.  It handles great, smooth powertrain, does not feel like you are in a van at all, its more like a luxury car feel.  The technology in this thing is great from the lane departure assist to the auto bright headlights, blind spot, collision mitigation, heated and cooled seats...it has it all.  Top that off with 30 mpg when battery is discharged, to using no gas when battery full and I think this will save lots on fuel for how we use it.  Wife has zero regrets on the trade in, she loves it so far.  Some things to keep in mind..the battery when fully charged says up to 33 miles before gas engine kicks in....when gas kicks in its seamless and you wouldn't notice unless looking for it, so you dont have to plug it in or worry about charging stations.  For the tax credit, research on your own but you have to have a 7,500 tax liability for the year to get the full 7,500 federal credit....so if you only had a liability of 5,000, you can only get 5,000 credit.  Reliability is my concern at this point...how long will everything last and keep working.  The hybrid warranty is surprisingly good.

The MSRP was over $50,000 dollars with my trade and dealer incentives I paid $33,000 cash to dive this fantastic cost saving Chrysler, FCA got this right they are ahead of all the others with this high MPG, Space, and luxury features, anyone looking for a PHEV could not want more bang for the bucks. 
In December 2018 I took delivery of a 2019 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid trading in the 2018 I had gotten, I did this to get a fully optioned Hybrid as good as the 2018 was near to perfect the 2019 is perfect with the exterior color I wanted to the folding outside rear view mirrors and even more than the 2018 had been lacking in options. I also got another $7,500 tax credit and another $2,500 TERP check which amounts to $21,000 thousand dollars total savings over all, and now I am in love with my Ocean Blue, Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid which I picked up on December 14, 2018 and put to this date July, 2020 almost 6,000 thousand miles on her using less than 15 Gallons of gas to get there it has a 16 Gallon Gas tank, using my level 2 charging home unit daily I am getting about 160MPG.

And trips, I'm averaging 28 MPG (75 mph for 2+ hrs).  The only issue I've had was the radio glitch that all Chryslers had that got fixed by an update. I feel safe in this van, the safety alerts are accurate and awesome. The storage is amazing and very well thought out. My kids love having their own captain chairs and say they are very comfy. The drivers seat gets 10/10 from me. The passenger seat got 10/10 from my 5 foot tall mom but only 6/10 from my 6 foot husband. The interior is very quiet when we drive, esp. When it's electric mode.

chrysler,pacifica-hybrid,2019,Nathan, 01/09/2019,New to the van scene,5,"I had been considering a van for a long time with 2 boys, ages 5 and 3.  We had an SUV but getting in and out was becoming an issue.  If parents want to ride with us, the SUV 3rd row was claustrophobic.  I also wanted a commuter electric vehicle to save/eliminate gas, ride in the HOV and save money.  Unfortunately my wife is against driving anything larger than her sedan so the idea of getting a van for her and an electric commuter for myself seemed a pipe dream....well, enter stage right the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid.  It’s obviously a van with all the room I was looking for but it’s also a plug-in, affording me the same advantages of the electrical vehicle.   I did exhaustive research and traded in my SUV for a 2019 Chrysler Pacific Hybrid Limited.  It is the top of the line version with all the options added.  Out the door was about $54k. But add in the federal and state rebate, it’s coming out cheaper than the gas version, AND I get my HOV lane.  It’s a win win as my wife can continue driving her sedan and I’m now commuting in a badass van.  I love getting pure electric miles and even when I ran out after 33 miles, I’m using a hybrid engine which continues to save gas.  I wish I had stow and go but it’s a small sacrifice for having a battery.  It drives great and thanks to the electric motor, accelerates very well for such a huge and heavy car.  The 360 camera is pretty awesome and the tripanel roof makes the interior light and airy.  The boys love the screens in the back with their remotes and wireless headphones.  Still kind of figuring it out.  Unfortunately the WiFi phone mirroring only works with Android but we get apple CarPlay which is awesome.  The option of opening doors and trunk by sticking your foot out is now going to be a must have on any future car purchases.  So far the only issue is the GPS seems a bit buggy as it would sometimes take awhile to load.  That’s my only complain so far.  I never thought I’d be driving a van, let alone a Chrysler van.  That said, it’s been great so far and once you get past the psychological barrier of driving a van, it really is pretty awesome.

chrysler,pacifica-hybrid,2019,Brian, 01/06/2020,"I loved this car, until it exploded at 6AM",1,"We've had a Pacifica Limited PHEV from August 2018 until June 2019.  We were extremely happy with it -- borderline evangelistic, in fact-- until the morning of June 15, 2019. At 7 am, we heard a loud explosion that shook the house and ran downstairs to discover the car burning in our driveway.  We called the fire department, and they were there in 5-6 minutes, but in that time the vehicle gas tank ruptured was the car was completely engulfed in flames 20 feet into the air.

The vehicle had been plugged into a standard 110V outlet overnight (actually, around 16 hours) using the manufacturer's provided charging cable. We hadn't driven it since the afternoon before. So it was fully charged at the time, and the engine was completely cool.   It had less than 10000 miles on it.

A neighbor's web cam caught the explosion. The vehicle was emitting a large amount of smoke for about 15 minutes prior to the explosion.  The detonation occurred inside the main cabin; it was powerful enough to send glass 30 meters either direction, and to bulge the roof and doors outwards.

Thankfully, no one was nearby to get hurt by the flying glass and everyone got out of the house; the only serious damage was to the vehicle, the driveway, and the nearby plants. If it had been in the garage, it would've been a different story (we would've lost the house for sure).

I called FCA immediately, and placed several follow up calls over the months, but have never heard back from them, despite multiple promises of a callback.  I have not heard of a root cause analysis, and they showed little interest in seeing the car after the fire.

This isn't the first battery fire while plugged in. Google ""A second Pacifica PHEV fire"" to see pictures of mine, and ""Pacifica Hybrid burnt to the ground"" to read about a nearly identical fire in Canada.

I can only advise all owners to install a smoke alarm in their garage if they park it there, and to install a self activating fire extinguisher in their vehicle.

Have over 10,500 miles total now and of that about half of the miles of electric ONLY!  Life of Auto that is 70MPG also be aware of many places with FREE Level-2 chargers, go shopping and come back to full charge.  Last time I bought gas was mid August after first oil change on trip home from Orlando and have driven almost 2310 miles since oil change and car says my range remaining is still over 567 miles.  On a long trip to Disney we hit an amazing over 843 miles on less than 15.5 gallons of gas, using charge stations in Orlando.  That's an amazing over 54+ Electric/Hybrid driving, and with the Tax Credit of up to $7500 depending on tax status brought our van well below non-hybrid limited, and Honda & Toyota models.  I just love our Level-2 home charger ability to fully charge in 2 hours and don't even think about going to Gas Stations or watch gas prices. With around town we have seen range of 30-40 miles depending on climate control settings and driving style and terrain.  Here is the simple math from NYTimes van such as Honda Odyssey around town gets 20MPG city based on average US gal of $2.96 gal it means it cost 15 cents a mile in town so if you drive poorly and only manage 30 miles in EV in the Pacifica to compare that would be $4.50 in gas at 20mpg, but only costs us at 13 cents a KW only about $1.70 to recharge, a savings of $2.80 a trip and when you use FREE Chargers or Solar power even more.  If you drove small trips everyday you could save over $1,000 a year in fuel savings, less engine maintenance since engine does start.  Save time at gas stations, and learn to drive well and save even more.  Imagine if you utilized free chargers everyday and you seldom used the 16.5 gallon fuel system.  You could save over $1,600 a year and over 5 years save over $8,000.  www.fueleconomy.gov and customize how you could drive EV or Plug-in Hybrid and save BIG!  We are way ahead of the annual savings since with apps like plug share have driven ranges of over 100+ mile trips on no gas, with just stops to eat while charging at free charging locations.  Now getting eMPG over 88 do 95% of driving on electric around town.  Usually can get between 30 to 40 miles on a charge depending on AC or Heat setting, and how you drive my record is still 44 miles on a charge.

chrysler,pacifica-hybrid,2019,Laurie, 04/06/2019,2019 Pacifica Limited Hybrid was a good year!,5,"Options vary by model features so confirm the BOM when you make the final selection.  The car qualifies for Fed energy tax credit and maybe state.  At $.10 per kilowatt electric cost.  The car will go 30+ miles on batteries so with 10 charges a month and 15KWH per charge maximum for less than 2 hours on a 30AMP EV2 means that for monthly driving of 300 miles in-town costs $15 versus 300 miles in a Town and Country van with gas at $2.50/gal and 20 miles/gal is $37.50.  That's over $200 savings per year on 3,600 miles!

chrysler,pacifica-hybrid,2019,Sparky, 09/06/2019,Love my Pacifica Hybrid Limited!,5,"One year in with 12k miles on the odometer I love my 2018 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid Limited.  My work site is 15 miles from home so I use electric for about 90% of my around town driving.  I plug in each night to my regular household outlet and let it charge overnight.  I once went 3 months between gasoline fill-ups.  The only time I add gasoline is for road trips and this van is a true road trip hero.  So comfortable on the highway, the two video screens are a massive hit with kids and with adult passengers.  Acceleration and hybrid gas mileage are great for such a big vehicle.  I had one recall repair in year one with no other issues.  UConnect is fantastic.  The turning radius is really wide forcing lots of 3 point turns compared to my old Toyota Sienna and that is about the only nock on this van.

chrysler,pacifica-hybrid,2019,Driving Miss Daisy, 01/06/2020,Best minivan on the market,5,"This is a spaceship. I bought the van in 2017 and I've been loving it since. I got free money from my Audi Q7 dieselgate, so this car is essentially free. Thanks Audi for letting me drive your car and helping me buy a new one. Edmunds is right, go for the expensive Limited Hybrid model with all the trimmings because you get to use them. I've used the adaptive cruise control on drives from LA to Vegas and San Francisco. The auto park feature is handy for street or mall slot parking. Have groceries and baby in each hand, no problem, wave your foot and sliding door opens. There's a backup camera, side camera, and front camera so it's great when trying to put your car in the garage or tight spots. The Uconnect system with 2 view screens in the back are great for kids. The GPS system has a gas finder which shows you where has cheapest reported gas and you can select it as a destination. Voice input is nice too, just say ""find nearest Costco"" and a list pops up. Fuel economy has been great. Electric only mode, I've gotten 35 miles from full charge to zero. eMPG says 54mpg but that's just estimate I guess. On my longest trip over 1000 miles from LA to Portland, I've averaged about 33mpg and this is for a 4500lb minivan. I've gone at most over a month without getting gas, but the engine will cycle and say ""fuel and oil refresh"". You can set the displays to your liking and I customized mine so it's like a video game. My driving habits are altered and I drive like 80 year old grandma but I don't care, my goal is to keep my kids safe and squeeze as much mileage as I can out of the battery. 30-35 miles battery capacity, I can usually drop of the kids at school, run most of my errands and make it home without using any gas. I have a level 2 charger from Chargepoint at home and I can fill it back up in 2 hrs. I had top of line Audi Q7 prestige model before and this minivan beats it hands down. I drove family and friends to airport seating 7 and all their luggage. I tried that once in the Q7 and it was a painful experience. Nothing fits after you raise the rear seats for 7 passenger in the SUV. I have 2 kids and putting in a double stroller is a pain in the Q7. You lose all trunk space. Demographics wise, I'm male, 43, college educated, west coaster raised in Texas. Yes, my friend made fun of me when I got the minivan and said I was ""gay"", ""middle aged"", ""losing my youth"", ""not cool anymore"", blah blah blah. I got over that BS. Yeah, try to fit 2 baby car seats into your Mercedes CLS and then go to Costco with stroller and try to buy a stack of toilet paper, diapers, formula, and paper towels and fit that into the trunk. The Pacifica is a good van to look at, it's real pretty in dark blue with light on at night, real sharp. Drives like a car, not like a truck. Honestly, you can rent one from Enterprise and try it for a week and you'll see it's really one of the best minivans out there.

chrysler,pacifica-hybrid,2019,James, 06/23/2019,Double Down!,5,"Okay, this is my report on the second Chrysler Pacifica Limited plug-in hybrid we’ve purchased. You heard me right, we were so impressed with the original Pacifica Limited PHEV purchased in June 2018, we went out and purchased a second one  in February 2019. We’re a Pacifica family!
So, what’s this love affair all about?
First, and foremost, quality. In my car buying lifetime, I've purchased Honda, Toyota, Lexus and Jeep Grand Cherokee. The inside and outside attention to detail, build and materials in the Pacifica are second to none of these - even the Lexus. The jury is not in yet on the original equipment Nexen tires, but so far so good.
Flawless performance.  No recalls, no defects (except the need for information center updates).
Comfort and quiet. OMG for the electric performance. Great torque. Smooth, almost effortless acceleration. The gasoline V-6 is nothing to sneeze at either.
Uconnect Information System & Theater  – this is amazing. A vast array of options to keep you connected, secure, passengers entertained and on the go – all displayed on a crystal-clear screen. Uconnect even comes with a VHR or Vehicle Health Report, which is a monthly report on vehicle performance and maintenance – tire pressure, engine oil, brakes, engine, safety, suspension and transmission. I really like this feature. 
Room for everything and everybody. The sliding doors make getting in and out of the rear seats effortless and because they operate electrically, you don’t need to be the Incredible Hulk to open them.
Mileage. We get the advertised 31 to 33 miles per full charge depending on driving conditions. And 4220 miles later, I’ve purchased just 19.6 gallons of gasoline on the one I drive! You can do the math, but that's 215 miles per gallon of gas. What's more, we've not noticed a substantial increase in our electricity bills since the purchase of the Pacificas. Bottom line: stingy on fossil fuels and good for environmental hydrocarbons.
Price. OK $49K is a lot of money, but for that you get an entirely modern, well executed vehicle that’s a blast to drive with outstanding build and quality. The $7500 Federal tax credit helps lessen the pocketbook bite as well.
Go for it!

chrysler,pacifica-hybrid,2019,Adam, 11/09/2019,Has ruined other cars for my kids,5,"After once swearing that she would never own a minivan, my wife can now hardly imagine owning anything else. Our last was a Honda Odyssey, which we enjoyed but starting giving me a steering problem in rain so I wanted something new with the latest safety features. We would never have considered Chrysler if not for the plug-in capability. But we are so happy with our choice. My wife uses it around town everyday and rarely uses gas. We only tend to need to fill up once a month around long trips. We enjoy the handling, the Uconnect, the great backup cameras, the space, and the safety features. We were blessed to be able to pull off getting the Limited, and my wife is starting to really love the heated wheel as it gets colder. I like the parking assist and 360 camera options, although my wife doesn’t trust them. 

The kids really love the dual screens (no shock there). We don’t let them watch videos except for very long trips, but they love the apps like an equivalent of Hangman that, on its most challenging level, has words none of us have ever heard of (they particularly like “smellfungus,” look it up, it’s really a word, and checkers). When we had a family trip with my parents, my mother in law, my family of four, and two small dogs, everyone was really comfortable. My kids now genuinely think traveling in my other car (a Mercedes C-class) is some sort of punishment because of the lack of screens and the difficulty getting in and out of the back (“difficulty” simply being the effort required for 99% of cars in the world). I told my 12-year-old that one day he may be inheriting the Benz, and he was very disappointed by the idea of not getting the Pacifica. He doesn’t care about prestige right now, he just knows what is comfortable and fun. 

The only downsides so far are that the placement of the automatic tailgate close button on the side of the back rather than the top of the tailgate can be annoying, and the parking assist did not work very well in the rain (another parked driver was not happy with how close it was advising me to get). But if it proves to be reliable over the long haul (a big if at this point), then we truly have our dream car (sorry Mercedes)."

chrysler,pacifica-hybrid,2019,Daonna Deas, 04/19/2019,Pacifica Hybrid needs towing capability & AWD,4,"I have owned two Chrysler Town & County LTD AWD vans. They have probably never gotten better than 23 MPG.  My current one has 125,000 miles on it, and can supposedly tow ""3,500"" lbs. I don't use that towing often, but I like to have it.  I am looking to replace it with the Pacifica Hybrid. But I see this lack: supposedly, it cannot tow.  ""Why not?"" is unclear: the engineers could have designed it to have its gasoline engine run the front wheels, and its electric motors run the rear wheels. This would make it AWD without a connecting driveshaft, and it could allow towing the 3,500 lbs via the gasoline engine alone (if, for some arcane reason, electric motors cannot be included in towing.)  So, as much as I really want the higher MPG of a hybrid, the all-gasoline vehicle may be preferable, annoying as is its much-lower MPG in the low-20s.
........................
Another minivan grumble: why are there never any cargo tie-downs within the vehicle?  These vans ARE used to transport bulky cargo, and having it slide around inside, unsecured, is annoying. "
chrysler,pacifica-hybrid,2019,Bill of Northern Wisconsin, 06/17/2020,Much better than any other vehicle I’ve ever owned,5,"What a great vehicle....smoooth!  Even after the electric is done, it’s still silky unless you really punch it.  Very comfortable seats and driving position.  I installed a 32 amp charger in my garage and it fully charges from 0 in just under 2 hours.  The U-connect system is the best! 
A couple details that are design flaws in my opinion are the ignition button is hidden behind the right side of the steering wheel and forces you to search for it rather than being in full view.  Then the seat belt hook-up slot is backwards...it’s hidden behind the release button which sticks up in the way when attempting to fasten it. 
I charge it after most trips and so far, after driving 750 miles I still have 3/4 tank of gas with an estimated 350 miles of range left.  With a $7500 federal tax rebate on tap, it’s a great bargain!

chrysler,voyager,2000,elurael, 02/15/2012,"2000 Chrysler Voyager 4-cyl, automatic",4,"This is the basic model (Base), and I bought it new in February 2000. It has a large 4-cylinder engine,
which allows for pleasantly surprising acceleration, yet 22 miles-per-gallon performance over all.
However, I did have to pay to add cruise control and a roof rack.
It does have an automatic transmission, which I also prefer.Everything else is manual (windows, door locks, etc.), but that is what I prefer. 
Aside from what I mentioned in suggested improvements, performance and function have been reliable and pleasing. At 70k miles, the brake pads have had to be replaced once and as well as the battery (at 10 years). I do try to keep it serviced regularly with 5 quarts of synthetic oil."
chrysler,voyager,2000,Belinda, 08/19/2008,Milage is age too,4,"I have had trouble with my trans too but I have a great trans guy. Just 1 adjustment no more leaks. After 125,000 mi my wheel fell off pass front. Hey 100,000 mile come on cars are driven more now than in the 60's. We hope in the car and dive 50 miles to go buy a pair of shoes and save $25. But do we remember to get the oil change every 3000 miles? Or do you have the fluids checked. every month. Your duty to your car is not to just put gas in it when it needs a drink, but to ck. under the hood every once in a while and if the driveway has a spot then take it to the dr. like it was your baby. in short be kind to it and it will be kind to you."

Water pump, fuel pump, radiator, thermostat, and tires.  Engine, transmission, and body are still in great shape, but crossing my fingers.  Brought it for $1,000.00.

I think it's a flaw in the design.  I used to love this car, I have 108K on it and the inside is still beautiful, the body and paint is great but the overall engine quality is shoddy.  I have a leak of transmission fluid and the repair would cost so much the mechanic told me to just keep replacing fluid it's cheaper.

Chrysler really did a nice job with this smaller version of their standard model. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a used mini-van.

The sway bar links and bushings are worn out every 6 months of driving due to the defective material that is used to save on cost. You drive down the road and it sounds like it is going to fall apart. The a/c unit smells bad for the first 15 min. They extended the warranty for up to 7 years, due to so many people having problems with this. I have own both a Chrysler and Dodge van and have had nothing but problems.

the emergency brake not being able to 
disengage, which in turn caused all of 
the rear brakes to need replacing. The 
secong time it wasn't starting at all

Predictably, a year later at 88K the torque converter locks up 150 miles from home. I have a 2000 Neon with a manual tranny that's one of the best cars I've ever owned, but I will never, NEVER buy another Chrysler product with an auto trans. I've read too many bad things about them. I can't trust a company that will not fix a widespread problem on one of its top-selling vehicles. That's a sign of a company that has contempt for its customers."

Actually has a sporty feel for a mini-van. Handles pretty well, I guess because of the short wheel base. Decent pick-up for a mini-van. Clean dash layout. Comfortable, too! Heavy seats don't bother me. Great value for the money. I compared it to the Town and Country; the latter was more luxurious but lumbered like a land yacht. Voyager is basic mini-van with  value and so far, reliability (except for that leak). "

Also, the sound system is pretty good. Only had problems with the taillights falling off. You'd be hard pressed to pass an '82 corolla. You don't make turns so much as you roll around them.

I have to say that once I drove the 200, I absolutely loved it. The press has been bashing the car, but I wonder how many of the ""experts"" actually drove it. The throttle tip-in has been criticized as too quick, quality too-low, fuel-efficinecy not good enough, and styling ""behind competition."" Has anyone seen and actually compared the competition feature for feature? The bottom line is that the 200 isn't a perfect car, but it is one that has a lot of character and quality to it. There is something very genuine about it. It's an underdog that over-delivers by my count. When price is considered, it's a clear win"

I average about six hundred miles a week and the mileage averages 26 to 27, city and highway. 29.9 highway only. Brakes have squeaked in reverse since I've owned it. Torque steer is really bad, you kick it you had better have a grip on the steering wheel. I've only had one warranty issue, the paint on the aluminum hood is bubbling. Dealer was great Chrysler is going to replace and paint a new hood for it. It's a blast to drive and is way more comfortable than the new ones, I've rented a couple of them for work and have issue getting in and out of them without bumping my head. The biggest thing to get used to is the visibility from it being a rag top. The windshield sits a bit too low. But so far I'm happy with it.

So now with 79,000 miles on it I'm still quite pleased.

Now at 130,000 miles and still going strong. No issues to date, just regular maintenance.

The dealership has done everything physically and mechanically possible and states ""they cannot fix the car"".
Chrysler's response is these are characteristic of this car; funny I don't remember seeing that on the sticker or in my owner's manual.
And the fun continues, as of yestserday, there's now a clunking in the steering column.

It's beautiful both inside and out and is a real head turner!
I've only had mine a week, but took it in to have SkyLink installed & several service guys gathered around it and got in to sit in it.
I came out of the office and one of them asked me, ""Have you seen our new 200?"".
I said, ""that's mine"".:-)


The interior on the 200 Limited is very classy!
You've got fingertip controls on the steering wheel and Chrysler did a great job with the symmetrical design of the dash and instrument panel. No dull square stuff. Very nice interior lighting.
You've got the Chrysler signature quartz clock in the middle of the dash. Both the interior and exterior are exquisite."

chrysler,200,2011,roadraven, 05/21/2011,First Chrysler,4,"The Chrysler 200 caught my attention because it had a nicer interior than many cars in it's price range.
The 3.6 L V6 was also a huge consideration.
It is equivilant to the Infiniti G35's that I had previously owned.
It's not as perky at start off as the Infiniti, but not bad.

I would not own one of the 200 models with the smaller engine.
I didn't drive one, but I feel like the 3.6 would be the only way to go.
The ride is better than expected.
It is very quiet and easy to handle.
The leather interior is very nice and similar to much more expensive cars."

Couldnt justify the $800 for a feature that most smart phones have for free.
The V6 is a must  this difference in fuel economy is 1-2 MPG for over 100 more HP.
The interior is very nice and the suede inserts in the leather seats looks and feels great.
Im a tech person so U connect was a big selling feature for me.
I have an iPhone that seamlessly connects to the stereo to allow for hands free voice activated dialing from your phones address book.
Simply say the name of the person you wish to call  its that easy.
You can also transition calls already in progress to the car and vice versa. "

Overall it seems to be a good car, good handling, seems to be fast enough for a 4 cyl and gets good gas mileage. Right after I purchased the vehicle I noticed issues with the cruise control.
Sometimes it would work sometimes it would not, the problem was intermittent. I had to take it to the local Chrysler dealership several times before they acknowledged there was a problem. Turns out it had something to do with the wiring in the steering wheel, the Chrysler tech said it looked like some one was in there before but no record of warranty work being done. Tech said it could have left the factory like that. Also breaks squeak in reverse."

Handling at speed is almost dangerous with lots of torque steer and no road feedback through the electric power steering. Fuel economy is poor (17 MPG combined).

It's a beautiful car great first car and we thought safer than the alternatives we had previously looked at! We were wrong. Since we bought the car we have had nothing but problems. It's got mechanical malfunctions in the steering and front end that we have yet to figure out how to fix and the rear end sways side to side so badly that if your going any rate of speed it will cause the loss of control of the car and spin you in a 360. It has never been wrecked or anything so this has to be a manufacturer defect. I'm now finding out that this year model of the 200's several have had the same complaints that Chrysler will do nothing about and there has even been loss of life due to these defects. I hope that Chrysler makes right by these cars by repairing the issues before someone's child is injured or worse being as this is a popular car among teen drivers and young adults. Like I said it's a beautiful car but is luxury and beauty worth the potential price of a life. I would advise to do ALOT of research before you buy this car for your own safety.

listening to music on that nice stereo. It's when I try to actually be a driver that it displays its inadequacy as a sport sedan. When you want to pass and you step hard on the gas, there is a noticeable hesitation before anything happens. Then you go, but not too fast. The transmission is a bit weird too. I'd like to talk to the engineer who decided to put a six speed in this car. Between 0 and 30 it goes from 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 and shortly after to 5. That's a lot of shifting in a short period of time; most of us 56 year olds don't need that. for full review see tkspitzernews.blogspot.com."

chrysler,200,2011,David Allen, 06/03/2018,Chrysler Whiner transmission noise,4,"At first it sounded as if my engine and transmission made much more noise than other Chrysler 200's. Turns out my underside and a side engine cover is missing. The huge bottom one has insulation on it. Not there and the noise reflects off the pavement and adds to the top noise.
And as I was told, get at least three opinions on transmission condition and do not repeat to them what each other says.
Looks like I'm good to go, and I find similar cars are $4000 for the transmission , the 200's 62TE can be had for ~$2200.

Next is how smooth and quiet it is at road speed. Then I put the pedal to the metal and unleashed those 283 horses, and boy, this baby flies! I read many reviews on this car, and it seems like for every positive review there was some character ripping it apart, calling it a warmed over Sebring, etc. Well, if you are in the market for one of these, the only advice I can give is take one for a drive and judge it for yourself.

I had set my budget at 25K out the door (tax and tags included). I also made up my mind that I would drive all the comparable makes & models before I made a decision. The Chrysler 200 was not even on my list until I had driven the Optima and Sonata, found that I was not happy with the standard 2.4 liter engine and the 274hp turbo would not fit in my budget. It was the 3.6L V-6 that made me try the 200S. To my surprise it was the quickest, quietest and best handling of the bunch and it had the media center, etc. Price w/rebates? 21,510.
Can't beat that - truly fun to drive. "

The seats are very comfy and I love the blue tooth ""UCONNECT""

The con to this car is the speakers and electronics.
The speakers aren't great unless you get the Boston Acoustics System (extra money)
So I plan to buy speakers elsewhere and upgrade.
My mother has the 200 S Convertible with leather seats and premium sound system and its amazing.
I couldn't afford something that nice so I went with the $8,000+ less model haha.

chrysler,200,2012,Alexandria, 09/25/2015,2012 200 V6,3,"I bought this car almost exactly one year ago. It's been in for repair way more than a car as new as it is with as low miles as it has. Cylinder head back in February. Then they rebuilt the transmission in May, brought it back in July because it was doing the same thing but they supposedly didn't find anything, then because it obviously didn't change brought it back in August they replaced a valve in the transmission, September the torque converter(which is something I told them to look at the second time they didn't find anything) AND the Cylinder head AGAIN. It's all under the extended warranty that THANK GOD I purchased. I bought it with 53K miles, it now has 70K miles. A car in my opinion should not need all those major repairs with those miles. Plus I kept asking them to look at the torque converter The buying exp. was terrible too, I was pressured into buying the car and he didn't give me a chance to look at many other vehicles. Outside of the major repair issues I love the car. I think it's sharp looking, rides smoothly when it's working, has great features and amazing power. Around 290HP is pretty awesome plus gets GREAT gas mileage for a V6. I love the LED lights around the headlights and the taillights too.

I looked at and researched mid-sized cars for 3 months before I decided on the 200. I liked the exterior looks of the malibu, but the interior seemed dated and the 2.4l engine was too underpowered for my taste. I finally decided on the 200 for two reasons, the 3.6l Pentastar is amazing 29mpg with 283HP. It is very quiet and docile at low throttle, but give it some gas and it feels like a rockestship! This engine is an absolute joy. The second reason was price, I walked out of the dealership at $20200.00 after all rebates and negotiations."
chrysler,200,2012,Kay, 07/28/2016,Great acceleration and sharp car,4,"I bought this brand new and got great pricing.  Was unsure about buying a Chrysler but this car has 80000 miles on it and I have not had one bit of trouble.  My husband is tall and not real flexible so he has trouble getting in easily.  My son is taller (and younger) and has no difficulty getting in and out.  The trunk space is too small for long vacations if 4 of us go, but we have made do. It also has a larger turn radius than I like.  It handles well otherwise and has been fun to drive. The gas mileage has been great. Traveled last weekend and averaged 31.6 mpg.  I am gifting this car to my son for his graduate school career.

Update 8/17--I gave this car to my son who is in Med school. He has always loved this car, hasnot had one iota of trouble, and with 84000 miles looks and runs like its brand new. He says we got an ""apple.""

chrysler,200,2012,fproctor, 08/09/2012,Limited with 3.6L V6,4,We bought this when after first looking at a VW Beetle. New styling of 200 is refreshing. Interior is classy in black. Lots of power with the V6; I expected there to be more torque steer during spirited driving with 283hp going to front wheels but the traction control keeps TS under control quite well. The mileage could be better but we bought anyways fully knowing what to expect. We traded in a 2010 VW Jetta TDI that had turbo lag the VW dealerships could not resolve.
chrysler,200,2012,Brocenter, 05/06/2016,Too many problems to be this new,4,"I have a 2012 Chrysler 200.  I have had it for 2.5 years.  I purchased the extended warranties thank goodness.  The heater core went out on the passenger side a year after I purchased the car.  I also had a recall done on the drivers side head rest in 2014.  In 2016 while driving home the drivers side head rest deployed hitting me in the back of the head VERY hard while driving.  I'm lucky it didn't knock me out.  All I wanted was my car fixed and Chrysler has sent their person over and did a review and sent me a letter stating it was nothing they did on their part.  So of course now I have my attorney involved.  I could have went to the doctor and built up a million in doctor bills because I know I have neck damage and it's causing issues with my arms but I just wanted my car fixed.  I really like my car, but it only has 69K miles on it and it should not be having these issues.  It handled really poorly when I first got it but I put good Toyo tires on it and now it handles great.  I hope they don't make a huge fight out of this because I really want to keep my car but I will get rid of it and never by Chrysler again if they don't take responsibility.

chrysler,200,2012,Fred Theoalagan, 04/08/2016,Stuck with this for a few months,3,"Have a Chrysler 200 that was rented for me for a few months.  Had it one week and already hate it.  Transmission is annoying.  Feels like something is wrong with car but apparently there isn't, was just told that's what the car does. They have a fleet and they all do the same thing, I was told.  It makes it feel like I am constantly making small acceleration/deceleration changes but I am not. Very uncomfortable when driven more than a few miles.  Rides is bad but can't tell if its the transmission or suspension.  Layout of and type of controls is nothing short of goofy.  The shift control is a knob right near all the radio knob controls, making it easy to reach for the wrong one.  Plus counterintuitive controls so it is uncomfortable to use. Emergency Brake is electric.  Seems entire car is dependent on a computer for all controls so, nothing manual.  Hate to know what would happen if the car's decided to accelerate on its own.   There would be no manual control to intervene.   If you are six feet or taller your head will rub against the ceiling in the back seat.   Does look nice though...

chrysler,200,2012,Roger T, 06/29/2016,Will never buy another Chrysler,1,"Wish I could afford to sue Chrysler for how off they are about the MPG. Have done regular maintenance on this vehicle over the 3 years I have owned it. No matter how easy I drive this vehicle I have yet to see overy 24 MPG. My average since owning the car is 21. This IS a 4 cylinder. Next, the acceleration is terrible. You press the pedal expecting it to go, wait 3-4 seconds of almost standstill then finally some movement. Not safe if you ask me when defensive driving is important. Braking has never been good. Any quick stop results in the entire vehicle shaking from its horrible anti lock. I have already been told that the brakes and rotors are good so again just terrible mechanics. There are many other things but my biggest pet peeve is the tricks Chrysler uses to force you back to the dealership for maintenance. For example, if you want to change the battery you must remove the front bumper, remove the headlight and then the battery. Even just changing the headlight bulb requires the same thing or removing the plastic in the wheel well. Ridiculous is putting it gently. Just look elsewhere at all costs. Buyer beware.
"
chrysler,200,2012,Lorri C, 10/28/2015,averaged- not the quality I was expecting,2,"I actually sought this car out; it was everything I was looking for. I purchased my 2012 200 Limited convertible in April 2015 with under 30,000 miles on it for $21,800.00 (a bit over priced but at the time I was ok with it). We test drove it at high speed on the highway, with top down and up, as a driver and a passenger. Since we travel one of the top things I was looking/listening  for was noise, and the only noise at the time was a small wind coming through the rear driver’s side window- I decided to deal with it since it wasn’t in my ear as a passenger, proving I’m not unreasonable.  Then the fun began.  

I used to have a 2008 Mercury Sable Premier, so I was spoiled. Even though they were both priced at almost $30,000 new, the 200 has nothing on the Sable. I have had several issues since buying it and after several trips to the dealer I’m left with ‘It’s normal’. The top squeaks when it’s up, sometimes worse than others and after a rain I can NOT put my windows down without a flood of water coming in… consistently.  Not drips, a flood. The drives side window would catch on the trim but they adjusted that. I have a bad wind noise in the car now, not sure where the hell that came from but… IT’S NORMAL, so they say! 

During this process I had been emailing Chrysler and they were getting back to me and following up regularly. After I got the final exam done on the car with the same ‘it’s normal for a convertible’ I then responded to Chrysler telling them I expected more from a 30,000.00 car. They did talk to the dealership and agreed… here’s a quote.  

“ they drove your vehicle and found the noise was the air rush on the outside of that car that would be due to it being a convertible. It is a normal noise. He stated you may experience a creek noise as it
will move due to it being a convertible. They found no water or air leaks.  He stated there is nothing wrong with the vehicle. He stated the body shop adjusted the windows. Some water will come in when the windows are put down. This is a normal condition when dealing with a convertible sports top. After thoroughly reviewing your request and the files on this matter, we respectfully concur with the decision rendered by the dealership.”

So I’ve owned a hard top and a soft top, the hard top was a Mercedes so I can let that slide but the soft top was either 96’ or 97’ Sebring. I wanted a better car and a quieter car which is why I got the hard top AND the Limited. What a waste of money! I could have spent less money and got the same quality. 


Other issues:
Delay in transmission- after you accelerate then let off the gas it will hesitates and drag back down. I was also told this is normal.

Uncomfortable- even if it’s listed as ‘premium’ leather. 
Navigation- Pain in the butt to use.     
Gas millage- not so good 
I wish it had memory seats and retractable gas peddle (I'm, only 4'11"")  

Pro's: 
Drives nice, little actual 'road noise', takes bumps well
Tight steering
Looks nice
Heat and air work well
Heated seats go up the back

chrysler,200,2012,scottporras, 05/16/2012,New Chrysler fan :),4," Got this car brand new (Blackberry Pearl on black interior with 17 miles) little over a month ago after getting in an accident in my Cadillac Eldorado, and have had zero problems, im very impressed! Gets good mileage (30-35 mpg hwy at 70-75 mph), comfrotable, with pretty good quality. I think its a great new gen Chrysler vehicle for anyone.

Has a surprisingly sporty feel to the suspension, hugs corners very well and feels pretty flat in the process, but soft and absorbing at the same time. Very nice interior with a majority of it soft-touch materials, gets lots of compliments from passangers. I4 engine feels pretty crude, opt for V6. As driving enthusiast I find it fun to drive."
chrysler,200,2012,jamcas2, 05/23/2014,Ok for the price but beware.,2,My car was bought in Jan of 2012. Since then I have kept the car well maintained. Having an oil leak I thought the people that did my oil changes messed up the oil plug. It turned out to be the engine oil seal. The dealership told me this is a common problem. Also at 26K miles my tires went bad. For this car being able to get tires with warranty at 100K miles this is bad. I was told the tires were not balanced. They were factory tires but are not covered. Also make sure you check your alignment often as this destroyed my front tires. I can now see the quality difference between Chrysler and Toyota. I owned my Toyota Corolla for 8 years no problem. Can not say the same about my Chrysler.

All of which can be changed for my taller husband (if I ever let him drive) It's fun to drive, sharp interior, 130 miles on it and used just over a 1/4 tank, great handling.

chrysler,200,2012,JustABill, 03/15/2019,Nice car,4,"Picked mine up at 7 years old with 100133 on the odometer. The price was right even though the mileage was high for the year. Overall it’s a clean, comfortable, fun, peppy car to drive loaded with nice creature comforts. Fuel economy from the 3.6L is a little lacking, about 24mpg combined for me so far. It makes up for it with its surprising power and handling. At 100576 the transmission started acting funky, still shifting reliably but not smoothly. I suspect the 100k maintenance hadn’t been done to the car yet. Will update after that gets performed. It’s long term reliability remains to be seen. Overall this car is super fun, the V6 is quiet, and it’s packed with features. Even though it’s essentially a reheated Sebring—you get a lot of handsome car for your dollar.

It still did the jerking after many transmission shops and talking with the dealer it took about 6 months to a year before the would believe me so they had me bring it in after about 6 hours they called and the bearing in the transmission had failed. Would have thought that they would put a new transmission to my surprise repared new parts a year later the same jerking and sluggishness when driving and yes I called the company and no help the dealer (galeana Chrysler of Columbia South Carolina  was no help sales men said it was my moms fault for signing the paperwork.

Cheap plastic accessory parts that break off. Rubber seals popping out around windows and convertible roof.  Windshield seal is separating, causing floors to be wet.  Infamous water in the dash from ac.  Ac fan is now making noise.  Dash lights flicker on and off.  Rear tires continue to have cupping, despite alignment.  There is a whistling sound when windows are up, probably another faulty seal.  Power windows USUALLY work.  If you are a smoker, there is no way to crack windows in the rain without interior doors getting soaked.  Extremely windy when roof is down.  Have to take off tires and other stuff to replace headlights.  Finally found the battery!  Have to take off tire to get to it. Really?  

I feel that all the great technology went into the engine and the sound system/computer (which is actually impressive) but no where else.  Very cheaply built, probably why it was listed as the most affordable convertible.

I found I missed many of the comforts of the Aurora...climate control, sun roof, V6 engine, etc.
While these options are available on other vehicles, the Chrysler 200 was priced far below the competition.
This would not have been my first choice in cars, but after 13,000 miles I still have not found another car I would choose over this one (for the money).

Overall - BEST VALUE.

I have to say I've had fewer problems with the used cars I've owned. My 200 currently has just over 30,000 miles my first service visit was right after I purchased it my key fob didn't work right you had to be within 5 feet of the car and press the button sometimes multiple times it turned out to be a lose coupler I had to take it in 3 times to get that fixed.
Next was some nylon string unraveling from bellow the steering wheel.
Then I had a knocking in the steering colum that has been fixed multiple times and lastly I just had the heater core and the radiator replaced due to heater failure! "
chrysler,200,2012,qpat2004, 01/11/2013,2012 Chrysler 200 Touring Review,5,"I have had mine for a week now. I was in a 2000 Buick LeSabre before this. I was looking for an easy transition and I found it in this car. I got the Touring model so I didn't get all the bells and whistles like heated seats, Uconnect, touch screen head unit, etc. Don't misinterpret, this care is loaded with many great features (listed below). The 200 rides very smoothly and is quiet for a very comfortable ride. It is also surprisingly roomy (even in backseat). I love the interior design with chrome accents. The exterior trim is classy and sporty at the same time which was exactly what I was looking for. I am getting the windows tinted next week to add to that."
chrysler,200,2012,Martin King, 03/23/2017,"New transmission at 62,000 miles",3,"62,000 miles and new transmission. Took dealer 4 weeks. Never had a transmission go out. I could understand if car had 120,000+ miles on it but at 62,000 miles, poor design, poor quality and poor craftsmanship in my opinion. Thank good it was covered under power train warranty.....

I like the design and standard features of the car(especially for $18k). I haven't had any real problems with it, and it still drives like it did when I got it. I will say that the transmission is rough, but I am a car person, so I looked up the gear ratios and noticed how far apart they are from first to second gear and that seems to be the reason. This should only affect the 4cyl because of its lower power. My fiance' has a 4cyl toyota corolla which does the same thing, so I think it is normal. I would have rather gotten the v6 for the power, but everything else is good. "

chrysler,200,2013,Matt Maloney, 06/12/2016,Going on 6 yrs owning (6 cyl model),4,"I bought this car used from Armory Garage in Albany NY as a certified pre owned with 14,500 miles and paid $14,800.  It was previously a fleet vehicle, so there were a few minor scratches.   I'm 5'6"" so this car fits me pretty good.   It's got a short trunk so is very easy to parallel park in the City.  It's quite peppy and the V6 has great acceleration.     I've owned the car for almost 5 years now and put about 45k miles on it.  There's been no major repairs necessary to date mechanically speaking.  I did have the front hood replaced under warranty as it was beginning to bubble near the front.  I think the car was in an accident (and the fact hidden from me) thus the bubbling edges on the hood and low price I got it for it, but the body guy told me he's seen it on others as well.  The other clue was the gap between the hood and grill vary from one side to the other.  I drove this car from NY to FL and back and it did not let me down.   A few annoyances:  both wiper sprayers broke.  I replaced them myself inexpensively with Mopar parts from Amazon.  Also, the recirculating actuator has gone bad twice making an annoying clacking sound behind the glove box when you use the heat or a/c.  

Pros:

Acceleration, handling, easy to maneuver and park in the city,  getting up to speed entering highways, stylish looking enough. 

Cons:  

Rotors.  The rotors had to be replaced at 18k miles due to shaking when braking downhill, and now at 44k the pads and rotors are almost due again.  The warped rotors first time around could have been a result from the car being a rental prev.  

Only 2 ports for charging/plug in gps .  (Touring Model)

Blind spot.  This car seems to have more of a blind spot than other cars I've driven.  Extra caution must be used when changing lanes.

Automatic gear selection.  At times it seems the car chooses a lower gear than I would like when going up an incline, it tends to bog a bit.  A quick step on the gas solves that problem downshifting the vehicle and delivering more than enough torque.  (Or slap shift is available as well).  Slowing down to an almost stop will occasionally make the transmission slam between 1st and 2nd gear, but no worries.

Trunk Space.  The trunk is smaller than most.  I couldn't fit a snow shovel in it so it had to go in the back seat area. 

Seats.  The cloth seems cheap but nothing a cover won't solve.  They are comfortable enough and the power seat makes enough positions for most.

Key fob.  Losing this key will cost you almost $400, but I guess that's on par with other makes and models.

Overall:  I like this car.  It's quick for a middle of the road sedan, unassuming looking from a police pull over point of view, and has been reliable to date.  From other reviews of the next generation of 200's, I would keep this before trading up to the newer versions.
"
chrysler,200,2013,Dale, 05/22/2016,Fun To Drive With V-6,5,"Of all the cars I've ever owned, I would say this is this funnest car I've purchased, and like my 1987 Chrysler Fifth Avenue I had 16 years ago, this is a car I like to be in. I have a 2002 Chrysler Sebring, which I'm selling and I do consider the 2013 200 a big step up in both quality and performance, although there is noticeably less interior space in the 200 versus my Sebring, which I believe is due to the seats having more cushioning and additional airbags within the cabin. I do like this version of the 200 over the current new version. My Sebring had the 2.7 V-6, while my 200 has the 3.6. Fuel mileage is better on the freeway with the 200, but I do get less mileage in town than I did with my Sebring. Once in a while I do get some torque steer if I happen to have more of a lead foot than normal, but other than that the steering is responsive and tight. I do wish I could raise the steering wheel just a tad more than what is allowed, because it's a tighter squeeze when I have to wear steel toe boots for work and the leg room in the rear is very tight, though I rarely have rear seat passengers.

So in updating this review, I downgraded the performance of the car primarily because, even after having software updates performed on the transmission 4 months ago, I still notice the transmission seeming a little confused with which gear it wants to shift to, as well as an occasional clunk while shifting. The update improved the performance, notably upon climbing hills, but still needs further improvement. I also downgraded the technology for the fact that FiatChrysler charges customers $150.00 for a navigation update disc for it's maps. That's a ripoff in my opinion. Lucky for me I kept the Garmin GPS I purchased for my old Sebring, and I can update that for free on my computer and use it in lieu of the built in system. 

The traction control in the 200 is great, as it helped the car up a steep ice/snow covered alleyway leading to my driveway. I've purchased new tires earlier this year and recommend the Goodyear Assurance Comfortred tires. These tires perform just as great on this 200 as they did on my Sebring, both in noise reduction and overall traction. With regards to the few complaints I have about the 200, I still like the car and it's still a fun car to drive. The flaws are noticeable, but not so much it makes for a miserable ride.

chrysler,200,2013,robcat20, 06/01/2013,A decent car,4,"I traded in my 2009 Ford Taurus SEL for a 2013 Chrysler 200 S Touring Sedan today. My first impression is overall positive. I have never owned a 4 cylinder engine before, and I am noticing a huge difference in power and speed. I brake tested the car by slamming the brakes at 45 mph. The vehicle did not loose control, but the stopping distance was sluggish. The vehicle is no comparison to the new Ford Fusion or some others in its mid-sized segment, but the overall value is far superior. I chose to save money and go for the chrysler. The interior is comfy and spacious which was a concern since I am a large guy and I traded in a much larger vehicle. "

I only have 2000 miles on it, so I can't comment on reliability. The powertrain is a gem - the Pentastar V6 is smooth and powerful and emits a nice thrum when accelerating, and the 6-speed transmission eagerly serves up downshifts. Fuel economy is so-so - 16 MPG around town and 29-30 MPG on a trip. The interior is impressively quiet with the soft top up - as quiet as many conventional sedans I've driven. My only complaint is the front seating - the lumbar bulge is much too big and much too high, which means I have to recline the seat, and the leg room is a bit skimpy for tall drivers. "

If you have sorta big feet it can hit the hood release easy,,, but okay here it is. it rained on Monday,and I barely went threw a puddle going about 40. it scared the life out of me. my steering wheel went back and forth like crazy sideways with the puddle. gotta stay away from that for safety!!! but i'm In Vegas hardly ever rains! in 5yrs,i'll be giving this car to my daughter for school if she keeps good grades!!!

The fusion has been back to the dealer going on 6 times now with this or that going wrong.

chrysler,200,2013,Kenz, 12/06/2018,Problems with heat,2,"When I first purchased the car there was a flapping noise in the dashboard. It turned out to be a rotator fan that broke. I thought it would go away for good once it was replaced, turns out I was wrong. I've had the car going on three years now. Every time it gets cold and I go to turn the heat on, it makes the loudest, most annoying flapping noise that continues for about two minutes. On top of that, the heat gradually gets colder on the passenger side. The first winter I had it, I paid $900 for a new heater core. That fixed it for that winter. The next winter, the problem came back. There was a warranty on the heater core, so I took it to the shop and told them the same problem was happening. They told me ""its only about 5 degrees difference on the passenger side"" which is a lie. When it gets icy, only the driver side of the window will defrost. I looked it up online and it turns out many other people have had the same issue with the heat not working correctly. That is the only issue I've had with the vehicle, everything else is great! If you live somewhere warm, its worth the purchase. If you live somewhere cold, absolutely NOT!

From the TPM needing to be replaced to everything under the hood being an issue. All the parts are priced high because it's a Chrysler but it's a crappy model so you're paying to put the best equipment on the worst machine. The battery is inconveniently placed. Even youtube university will advise you to take the car to a mechanic. It's built funny and unreliable. I love the car because it's my first car but for what I paid, I would've been better off getting another car. It was not worth it at all.

chrysler,200,2013,Steinar Andersen, 07/22/2018,An upgrade to my previous 08 Sebring Hardtop vert,5,"I previously had a silver/grey 2008 Chrysler Sebring Touring Hardtop convertible (with most of the Limited's options). So upgrading to a red/cream 2013 200 Limited Hardtop convertible was pretty straight forward (all controls and features are basically the same). Except, the 200's materials are much nicer than the previous Sebring's plastic finishes.  The 200's 3.6 Pentastar/6 speed tranny combination (with autostick) was a pleasant surprise compared to the previous 2.7/4 speed tranny combination from 2008. No more hunting of gears while on hilly terrain with the 200. The entertainment/gps system was also slightly improved and unlike the manufacturers constant need to further complicate infotainment systems (I have a 2020 Chrysler Pacifica that has a HUGE manual needed to find everything for its infotainment system), the 730 stereo has enough fun features without being overly complicated. The 200 also rides quieter. The cherry red exterior and cream interior is a striking color combination, and looks nicer than most other convertibles. The hardtop feature of the convertible is what wins with me due to better security, quieter ride, and the ability to drive in the winter without worries of the snow load during storms (only the Volvo and VW Eos had this feature but like the 200 convertible, they also no longer manufacture a hardtop convertible anymore).... otherwise, I'd have looked at the Mustang or Camaro convertible. Unfortunately, Chrysler stopped making these Hardtop convertibles in 2015.... so I bought this used 2013 to last me another 15 years as there is nothing being sold now or on the horizon that compares. The 2013 is the epitome of the three and a half generations of the Sebring/200 convertibles (1996-2014), and unless Chrysler starts making another one..... all I can say to the person looking for a good used convertible, is to buy a good example of a 2013/2014 200 Limited or S Hardtop convertible. You won't be sorry (just make sure you get an extended bumper to bumper warranty for piece of mind). I bought this one with 96,250 miles for $13,250 (including the 5 yr/60,000 mile ""premium"" warranty)...... and I consider it the best buy out there for a hardtop convertible. Bar none.

chrysler,200,2013,Kevin R, 03/11/2020,Have to get the Pentastar!,4,"I bought a 2013 200 back in 2015.
Ex rental car from Hertz, so it had a few miles on it but all the maintenance was up to date, also under $10,000 .
I had been looking for one because of  the great press about the pentastar 3.6 engine.
And i have not been disappointed , its a great engine giving almost 300 hp..on a small car.
The 200 accelerates fast and smooth..and the gas mileage is only a tiny bit more than the 2.7.
Never had any trouble in 70,000 miles mechanically..but some of the interior and body work appears cheap and shoddy. In particular the trunk latch going out..and you cant open it as there is no external keyhole on the trunk.
As i am cheap i just ran some cable from the front seat to the trunk and attached it to the emergency trunk release..just give it a tug and it opens.
The battery also is in a terrible place down by the front driver side wheel..and the light bulbs are an absolute nightmare to replace, unless you got flexible octopus arms.
But that engine and the 6 speed /shifter....beautiful.
Worth keeping despite all the cr$p.

I don't drive 4 cyl cars anymore. V6 is just too practical for mileage/power combination. I get low 20s MPG in town and 31MPG Hwy. I'm just not willing to give up all my power for the extra 6 MPG that a 4 cyl ""might"" provide. 
There is no way to shut off traction control. But I disconnected the brake sending unit and it shut off the traction control... I was just curious.
 You don't realize how much power you have under you with traction on. I could smoke the wheels off without even trying! 
It makes a huge difference with traction control on, it bridles that HP in a safe and satisfying way.
I've put about 10k miles on both cars. Have had no problems at all.
I did replace tires with some Kuhmos from tire rack, I love these tires and they're comparatively cheap too! 
My main complaint is the delay in downshifting manually. You tell the car what you want to do and it decides what it will do and when. My Mazda cx-9 sport shifter responds instantaneously, so it's an adjustment.
My other major complaint is that you cannot go even 1MPH and activate the top.  I used to be able to motivate the top on my old '03 Sebring up to like 15mph. Very helpful if that stop  light is just a bit too short for full activation. I suppose it is because the entire trunk opens up when moving the top, which might allow your belongings to fly away at speed. My old soft top was dysjuncted from the actual trunk space. 
A minor thing, cruise control sometimes will not turn on.. In either car, so I assume this is a computer function or malfunction. Sometimes it eventually responds and other times I have to restart the car. 
It did take 3 weeks for the dealer to get the main roof seal (maybe due to Wuhan flu shutdown, I'm not sure) .
They decided to replace a window track as well which only took a week to get.
The thing about this hard top is that I couldn't find any Bodyshop or convertible shop in Richmond, Va OR JAX, FL that would touch it, so you're going to be stuck with the dealer handling any hard top Issues. On the bright side, Whitten did a heckuva nice job on it. 
Of course, it's the same with any Mercedes or BMW as well. At least I didn't invest $50k+, So I don't mind a little upkeep when it happens.
I'm 6'2"", but I find it very comfortable to drive and ride in. I LOOOVE the 'Uge trunk! Even extremely useful with the top down! I did se reaearch before buyingtje 2nd one and I couldn't find ANY convertible with this much trunk space. It's so nice that it is such a practical car. 
The Bluetooth is a bit clunky but I'm getting used to it. The sound system in the limited is definitely worthy of a convertible. I can't even consider turning it up loud without the top down. I also still prefer my TomTom over the built in GPS, but buying used, I didn't pay extra for that feature anyway.  
I almost hate to tell people how good of a deal these cars are on the used mkt. I might want to snag a few more for my family.

chrysler,200,2013,Diane Moffitt, 01/03/2017,Designed Poorly,3,"This car is almost dangerous to drive. The rear window is small and the headrests on both right and left rear seats block two-thirds of your view. I have to keep the backseats down to see safely. The exceleration is unpredictable. From a stopped level position you can excelerate and the car will either lunge forward or barely excelerate.  The interior is cheap. My passenger side electric window control fell off the door and was hanging by its wires. The plastic chrome coating is chipping off the interior door handles and cut my finger.  With the front wheel drive in this car, you hear a lot of noise from the front suspension but checks out okay. I owned a 2002 Chrysler Concorde LXI for 12 years and it was a far superior product.  It saved my life when T-boned by a truck. This 200 Touring sedan is pure junk.

They improved the suspension in 2013 and with the added power of the 6 cylinder it makes for a much better overall driving experience. This is the last year for the convertible, so we plan on keeping it for a long time as nothing else comes close. FYI we bought this certified pre-owned with just 12,000 miles for just $18,500

I did put better tires made for rain and snow on it because it had hydroplaned. I haven't had any problems with that since. I finally found the fog lights and they go out quite a ways, a must in deer country. (it helps to read the manual). We took a long trip and I found the back seat to be very comfortable for a 5'5 woman. The trunk is spacious and deep. The only thing I would change would be the interior lighting. It is extremely dim at night. It could be a little brighter.

chrysler,200,2014,Bob G., 11/29/2017,Very Under Rated!,5,"This is my 3rd 200/Sebring.  My '10 Sebring was mechanically excellent but interior materials were hard plastic.  I put 160K on the old 3.5L without any issues.  The '11 200 upgraded with soft to touch materials.  No issues & traded it in with 156K on it after taking it from one of my salesmen at 82K.  The '14 200 I drive now has also been perfect.  I bought it with 8200 miles & it is at 121K.  No issues, just normal service items.  Quiet, solid, handles well, comfortable with excellent fuel mileage.  The I-4 mated to the 6 speed transmission consistently is in the low 30's without any issues.  It is not a race car but at 80 on the interstate it does just fine with enough passing power to be safe.  Oil (blend) gets changed once per month (about 4000 miles) along with rotate/balance each time.  For the money it is a great vehicle even though the auto ""experts"" continually bash it based on the models they test.

The V6 is pretty good. I wish they had developed the 8 speed AT earlier or given it maybe 20 more HP. But it is definitely adequate. 
  As one reviewer mentioned, interior lighting lacks safety lites on the doors and lights under the dash, As well as dim trunk lighting. Not sure why, with all the LEDs and attn to detail they missed that. But I bought some bright LED license plate lights that are tiny. She's about to get a lighting upgrade!
I've owned it a year & put new rear brakes & Kuhmos all around. 
When it's stored for long periods, the steering pops a bunch. But I discovered when I was driving it daily, the popping went away after a week or so. 
Super looking and riding vehicle. It's my all time favorite! Even enjoying the refinement over the raw power of the old 'vette.

chrysler,200,2015,dburchardt, 11/09/2014,"50,000 mile update",4,"I picked up my new 200 Limited less than a month ago and love it so far. The styling, in and out, is above all the other mid size sedans out there. I love the rotary shift and the 9 speed works well. The car feels like a quality auto. The doors and hood close with a quality sounding thunk. Much better than my wife's Rav 4 in terms of quality build. Chrysler has made a quantum leap from the previous 200. THe ride is quiet and comfortable without being floaty. The engine is smoother than Rav or Altima. I am excited to drive this car to work every day. I am getting about 34 mpg in everyday mixed driving. I drove Camry, Accord, Altima, Fusion, Sonata with the 200 coming out on top. Try it.
Update at over 20,000 miles.  Still love the car overall but the tranny is beginning to try my patience (more the programming than the hardware. The programming has been updated 3 times and every time it gets worse than the previous generation.  I really had no major issues with the initial programming except the cold (below 20 degrees) first 1-2 shift seemed very lethargic. That didn't change but then the highway downshifts from 9th would only go to 7th then up to eighth etc.  Now, after the last update, the downshift, when coming to a stop, has become very rough and jarring and some 1-2 shifts are very jarring. My wife even commented on it.  It is going in again next week for another reflash of transmission module, so we will see if anything has been remedied.  Otherwise, I love the car and it features.  It is super comfortable and doors, hood and trunk sound extremely solid when closed. Toyota could take some lessons. Still getting 34 mpg in mixed driving.
Update at about 28,000 miles. Still love the car and the tranny is behaving much better after the last reflash.  This is the most comfortable car I have ever owned. Seat comfort is superb and the features are great.
36,000 mile update:  Still love my 200.  No repairs needed as of yet besides normal maintenance. Still love the comfort and build quality.  Still at 34 MPG overall.
Just turned 50,000 miles and still am happy with my 200.  THe only type of repair required so far was a new battery recently. I just checked the milage today and still at over 34 MPG in everyday driving.  THe car is still super comfortable and overall solid. The tranny is behaving pretty well with no serious issues.  If they still made this car I would seriously consider another one.
I did trade the vehicle now.  We still own a FCA vehilcle as now invested in new Ram 1500

chrysler,200,2015,Middleaged Professional, 06/24/2016,Just drive it.,5,"The Chrysler 200 is a step above its competition, especially at this price point.  It’s smooth, stylish, elegant and well-engineered from every aspect inside and out.  My impression is that it is quiet, efficient and a genuine joy to drive.  Being frugal, I drive my vehicles for a long time before replacing them and bought one immediately after a test drive.  I encourage anyone considering a luxurious, fuel efficient classy sedan to simply drive one before passing judgement based on the oddly conflicting reviews (some rave about aspects that others claim to be abysmal) I’ve read or seen here and other places after buying mine.  As for my perspective, I’m a 6’, 200 lb, 40 something professional ($100K+ annual salary) with a graduate degree and most of my family and friends are in the same socio-economic circle.  Myself, family and friends all own, drive or at least ride in sedans ranging from Cadillacs, Mercedes, Buicks and Chryslers to Fords, Chevys, Dodges, Subarus, Kias and Hondas.  Some are brand loyal to a fault and I don’t begrudge them for it.  This is despite the many issues they’ve all experienced privately but don’t speak of openly and certainly don’t write on-line.  Things like serious suspension issues with Cadillacs to catastrophic transmission, engine and electrical failures with BMWs, Hondas, Mercedes, Subarus and Toyotas.  It’s as though all a dealer or manufacture has to do is call the repair/replacement a “service update” to satisfy them their car is still the best.  Besides, who cares that most of them are dissatisfied with or can’t figure out how to use their navigation systems and electronic interfaces with their smart phones which are designed to make life easier.  FYI – those interfaces all work flawlessly in the Chrysler 200 in my experience so far.  Since buying it, I have heard or read criticisms ranging from poor quality manufacturing (panel gaps? I’ve seen far worse in Hondas) and materials, to tight, uncomfortable interior (one was a ridiculous clown like attempt to fold themselves into the same back seat I can effortlessly get into, out of and ride in comfortably (I'm 5'10"", 220)), a ride so bad you couldn’t stand in it for more than 30 minutes before needing an ambulance rescue and even a claim of dangerous handling characteristics.  I think if you just drive one and judge it for yourself based on the merits of your own impressions, that you’ll be pleasantly surprised and may buy one, just like I did.  Update: 6 months and 6,000+ miles later, I like the car more than ever and have received nothing but compliments so far.  Although the ride and handling are excellent, I do feel the factory tires should give a more quiet ride in this car and I'll replace them with something else when the time comes.  My fuel economy has increased from an an average 27.5 mpg to 30.5 in the mixed driving I do and I've seen a high of 35mpg on a mostly highway drive one weekend through the mountains.  That drive impressed me not only with economy but also with how much speed and power the car had at altitude and how smoothly the base engine and 9 speed transmission pair.  *** My update is that I traded my I4 FWD Limited in on a nearly identical V6 AWD C (I like the blue color). Why? Was I not satisfied with the lower trim model and drivetrain?  No, not at all.  I helped Mom go car shopping which involved a lot of test driving. Much more than I had done myself when I was shopping for myself. She was interested mostly in import and domestic SUVs and sedans over a month long period of time.  It was extensive and a little exhausting.  What happened after all that? She chose a Chrysler 200, V6 FWD, top trim level and I loved the power and upgrades.  So, I got an upgrade in AWD for myself. Sadly, Chrysler, Ford and GM are all actively abandoning sedans in favor of SUVs now.  What a shame as many, such as this one, so clearly
 outshined there imported counterparts in so many ways and for a better price.  After another year, I like my Chrysler 200C AWD more than ever and it’s still getting as many approving looks and comments as it originally did.  I’ll definitely be hanging onto this one for a while as fewer and fewer sedans are available now.  Who would have imagined that a country with our automotive history and culture would wake up one day to everyone driving tall, clumsy station wagons?  I like this car more and more and truly lament the loss of the classic American sedan.  Since I last updated this, the tall station wagon takeover is nearly complete.  I've learned that Ford is now down to 3 cars, I think, and the future is uncertain for two of them; MOPAR is likewise down to 3, with one on the way out; GM is dumping the last of Buick's cars, more Cadillacs and Chevy's too, soon they'll just have the Corvette, Camaro and possibly one Cadillac.  It's astounding, soon the only option we'll have are SUVs and I'm not quite ready to join the Mommy/Millennial Minivan replacement ""revolution.""

chrysler,200,2015,Ryan, 11/25/2015,1 Year Review,5,"I am coming up on owning this vehicle for 1 year now.  I have the C level trim with AWD and it has not been disappointing.  Having come from only SUV's, I was not sure how well I would like adjusting to a sedan especially in snowy and wet weather.  I did my due diligence in test driving almost every car in this segment, and this one stood out more than any of them.  The most appealing for myself was having AWD and the V-6 as well as a very nice interior that is comfortable to drive on long trips and my daily commute to work that is 41 miles round trip.  I really appreciate the reviews I see on here that actually tried other cars for comparison and other trim models.  If I only went off the base model rentals cars I have had in the past, there would be some pretty terrible reviews but unjust reviews.  You really need to try the 6 cylinder versus the 4 to get your own opinion, but it has more power and boost than any v-8 I have owned in the past.

Looks (Exterior & Interior):  

Looks I feel are like comedy...very subjective.  At very first look, I loved the rear end lines and tail lights on this car.  I was not as much of a fan of the front end. What I did love about the front was the LED running lights that really stand out.  As far as the interior goes, I couldn't be happier.  The Nappa leather with heated/cooled seats as well as the hand stitched leather steering wheel that is heated is wonderful!  The remote start (which many other brands will have as well) is amazing for those hot and cold days, as your car knows what to automatically adjust to warm or cool the car.  The navigation Uconnect 8.4 is very easy to use and has great traffic and weather outlooks and updates, as well as letting you know when your favorite sports team is playing and the score.  The panoramic sunroof is one of my favorite options that really opens up the ride.

Performance:  

The quickness of the v-6 has been very impressive.  I have not had any issues with any weird shifts with the v-6 so I am not sure if that is more of problem with the 4 cylinder but something I would recommend driving both.  I drive mostly in dead stopped traffic both ways and will end up around 23-26MPG.  When I actually get to do more freeway and long trips over the mountains, I will average around 32-34 mpg. The second day of ownership I had to drive over the mountains to the central part of the state in very large snow storm.  I was very nervous coming from Jeeps that have always fared me well with their 4wd and ground clearance.  Again, I was very surprised!  This model uses the same base AWD system that the Jeep Cherokee uses and handles great.  I have had zero slipping issues and control as been spot on. I am not recommending this as an off road AWD rig, again this is just a 4-door sedan.  But if you are looking for something that is extremely safe and handles snow and other bad weather well than this works great.  The 9-speed that is made by ZF which also makes the same tranny's for Bentley, Rolls Royce, Maserati (sister brand) etc...  I was very concerned about so many gears, but this 9-speed has been 100 times better than my previous 5-speed Mercedes transmission that was always clunking into gear especially on hills.

Conclusion
This 200 and a complete 180 from the previous generation and has made leaps and bounds to make it one of the tip rated in safety, and interior qualities.  The combination of the Jeeps AWD system, ZF transmission, same chassy and brake calipers as the alpha Alfa romeo Giulia (check out the 2017 model), and the award winning interior made by Chrysler has been a great combination.  The lane detection feature has been great, and will easily put your car back in the lane if you drift.  The park sense has many levels of sensitivity and has done a great job keeping me from scraping my wheels and has stopped my car completely in a parking lot when a
 car was rushing behind my car backing out.  The self parking either parallel, or backing in is a nice feature but not something I use too often.  The automatic cruise control has been great for long trips on the freeway as it will adjust your speed according to the car in front of you and the car spacing you set it too.  I have read a lot of issues with complaints on the rear head room.  This is another issue I have seen on other cars and is more of an issue if you plan to haul a lot of adults.  I am not a tall individual at 5'10 and have had no issues.  My friends are all around 6'3 and will definitely be more cramped in the rear.  Luckily we typically never ride together as we all have our own cars.  For kids, I have used this numerous times to haul my niece and nephew and getting the car seat in and out was not difficult at all.

At the end of the day anyone's taste as far as looks are subjective.  But I would highly recommend at least trying to test drive this model, especially the C trim. MSRP was around 38K, and got it with no money down for $28,995 with every option.

chrysler,200,2015,Stingraybike, 01/28/2016,Fantastic car for money,4,"I have owned this car since buying it new in August of 2014.  I was replacing a tired 17 year old car. I had looked at many brands and i just would find myself back at the Chrysler website.  I had a set price point and I knew what features I wanted and ones that i didn't. As i would look at many different brands they just could not hit the price point i wanted, especially when it came to a fully loaded car. I also love the design they really hit it out of the park. I bought her fully loaded with the tigershark engine in the mid 20's, nobody was willing to touch that price point.  I was a little hesitant to buy a four cylinder since i was used to driving a six. I will admit after testing it, it was a little underwhelming but I was willing to give it a shot. From time to time I wish I would have looked more at the V6, but now after owning it as long as I have I am used to the power and know when and how to give it the juice to get the right pickup that I need. I have had no engine or powertrain problems it has been flawless. the trans is can be rough from time to time and may hunt a little and when stopping and starting from a stop it is a little rough as it does not kick down to 1st quick enough in my eyes but if you are making a proper stop by the rules of driving than it is fine. I love the interior features and options. Seats are comfortable, the rear seating can be a little cramped for a taller person but I bought it for myself and it is great for me. The size of the 8.4 screen is perfect. I like that most of the features are accessed through the screen and are well laid out and labeled.  I have had a few hiccups at the beginning with the Uconnect  infotainment system but nothing that didn't fix itself within a few min but overall it is fantastic.   It will also read and write text messages for you which is great.  I like the digital gauge cluster, it gives you all of the info you need along with turn buy turn info to help you navigate. The buttons and switches are well laid out, I like the rotary gear shifter, a lot of people don't like it but from moving from a manual transmission car all the automatic gear shifters are toys and a waste of space. The  headlights and fog lights provide perfect visibility and turn on when needed due to the auto light feature.  In terms of driving,  It took me a little time getting used to visibility but i have 0 problems now.   If i had any bones to pick it would be the lack of a CD player, but i am just old school. I have the panoramic sunroof and I love that feature on this car. The premium sound system is great. I love the remote start on this car as the heated seats will kick on if the temp outside is below 40 deg and the A/C will kick on if it is hot out.  As for the exterior i opted for the 19"" wheels, I love how she looks with the 19""s, I did also buy a set of winter wheels and tires as I wanted better winter traction and I didn't want all the salt from the Chicago winters to corrode those nice wheels.  To me the AWD would be nice but for me it is not needed as I have been driving in chicago winters all my life. I have only had two warranty issues , one was a turn signal that was collecting water, and the sunroof cover would pop off track, both were replaced without a problem. Other than a few small things this car has been fantastic. I have seen some reviews with people experiencing some pretty bad problems with them but luckily I have not experienced any. I would not let those few problematic reviews keeping you from considering this car.  I feel they did their homework and the design is fantastic. I love driving this car and always have to give it the lookback when you are walking away from it.

chrysler,200,2015,200cawd, 12/06/2014,200C AWD,4,"Purchased a 200C AWD with every option available at the end of July.  To date, have 7000 miles.  I am very impressed with the performance, comfort, and features of this car.  This one has the Pentastar V6 and has consistently returned 30+mpg overall fuel economy.  I'm blown away by this combination of efficiency and V8-like power.  The car accelerates very strongly.  It's been in for one warranty repair to fix a locked up media player.  A software update set all right again and the car has been flawlessly reliable since. A recent snowstorm gave the AWD system a good test and the car performed exceptionally well.  It feels very safe.  A worthy contender for a spot in anyone's driveway."
chrysler,200,2015,Bodega Bay Bill, 03/10/2016,Best Sedan I have Ever Owned,4,"As a point of reference, my wife and I have owned many Nissans over the years, including the Maxima and Murano. Consumer Reports typically gives very high ratings to these two cars yet they hate the 200. Sorry, but I have no idea what they are thinking. The biggest gripes seem to be the transmission and the rear seats. Okay, the transmission has perhaps too many (9) gears, although I do get a perverse pleasure out of saying to people, ""what, you only have 8 speeds?"" I use the paddle shifters, which makes the transmission perform much better. This car is quite fast compared to similar vehicles. My car has AWD which adds a few tenths to the 0 - 60 dash. Consumer Reports never tested the AWD version, which handles superbly. The rear seat is not that bad and certainly is comparable to the competition. If you want a roomy back seat buy the 300! I have sat in the back of quite a few cars that get better ratings and there is very little discernible difference. Measurements don't lie. Compare the rear legroom to other cars and you will see that the 200 is right up there with similar vehicles. 

I love the interior. The 8.4"" infotainment system is hands-down one of the best you will find anywhere. Steering wheel controls (paddle shifters!) are intuitive and easy to use. Seats are very supportive without being too snug. I have the heated seats and all-wheel drive and have driven this car in the snow - no problems at all. Our Murano does better but of course it has much larger tires with deeper lugs. 

The suspension is a little soft, but then this is the ""C"" and not the ""S"" model. I personally don't want to be pounded by potholes and the 18"" wheels are a good compromise. And despite the 295 HP and all-wheel drive, I can easily achieve 30 to 31 MPG on the highway. Fantastic!

This car seems to be rather polarizing but I have no regrets after 34 months of ownership.

chrysler,200,2015,Rod Reichardt, 11/02/2015,Great Car Flying Under the Radar!,5,"We needed a car for my son who just got his drivers license. It needed to be safe, reliable, economical, and all the other things a parent looks for in their child's car. My son wanted a car with leather, nav, good audio system, good looks and ""cool wheels"". Oh, it also needed to be under $20,000. Impossible? I wasn't hopeful but started by perusing cars on Carmax.com. After a few hours I noticed a trend of nicely equipped Chrysler 200s right in the range I was looking for. I read a few online reviews and began to realize that this car is one of the few great deals of the current car market. I realize hat styling is very subjective but I think this is a great looking car. The MSRP of the 200C we settled on was $12,000 over the asking price at Carmax of $19,998. It had 3200 miles on it. It is front wheel drive with the 2.4 liter ""Tigershark"" 4 cylinder with the 9 speed auto and the optional 19 inch wheels. Not a fast car, but certainly not slow either. The full leather interior is good quality. Not quite Aston Martin or high end Audi but very nice. The 8.4"" Uconnect infotainment system is really, really good. I wish there were physical buttons for the heated seats but the menu is only one layer deep on the screen so it's not much of an issue. The optional Alpine stereo sounds decent. It has a claimed 506 watt amplifier which provides decent bass.  The voice control and Bluetooth are really good. I had the 8.4 Ucinnect in a 2013 Ram 1500 and the firmware seems much better now. It seems quicker and much less buggy than the earlier version. The messaging works fine with my Galaxy Note 5 but not with my son's iPhone 6S. This car will cruise all day at 80-85 (we live near Texas Highway 130 which only has two speed limits; eighty and eighty-five. After a few hundred miles we are getting an average of 26-27mpg. Most of my son's driving is around town so I am happy with the mileage so far. I was not expecting much from th 2.4 liter power plant but it seems perfect in this application. Acceleration is just fine and it s quiet. The little sound you do hear is nice. Not at all rough like some fours in midsize cars. The only complaint I have about this car is the transmission. Th 9 speed will occasionally throw out a rough shift or shift too slowly. Sometimes it will hunt for the right gear. Hopefully the software will get better with time like it did in the Uconnect system. The car was new in January of 2015 and there is no record of it ever going back to a dealer. I have no idea if there are any updates for this transmission but I will be looking into it. It's not a big issue though. I have never noticed it when I have been driving. My son is a little less decisive in his application of the throttle so that may be a contributing factor. 

You can probably tell that we are very happy with this purchase. We like it so much that my wife wants to get one. I think the low used price is partly due to the ""rental car"" nature of the previous generation of this car. I rented a 2014 just a few months ago and felt exactly like a cheap rental car. The new generation feels anything but cheap. The build quality seems really high. When you're driving it it does not feel at all like a generic mid sized car. It feels a little ""special"".  I was not expecting that at all. 

The 200C is punching way above its weight. I have been shopping new ones for my wife and AWD V6 models with radar cruise control and every option in the book are selling for under $30,000. The only negatives I can think of are the slightly balky transmission and relatively poor resale value. I imagine they will eventually get the programming right in the transmission. If you're worried about the resale just buy used. This is the best I have felt about a car purchase in years. I neve dreamed we could find such a great car for such a great price. Definitely 5 stars from us.

chrysler,200,2015,cph, 06/22/2017,As good as it gets,5,"What ever you do don't take some of the negative reviews about this car too seriously. I've been driving cars for over sixty five years and most of these new cars today drive very well although some are pretty ugly. My judge of a good car are it's looks, handling, reliability, interior looks and Comfort.  Consumer reports has always from day one beat up on Chrysler products mostly unjustified. Over the years they have pretty well brainwashed car buyers against this brand.  There are always going to be buyers out there who aren't going to be satisfied with what they buy for one reason or another hell some of them told me back in the day I never should have bought my new 57 chev 2dr hdtp so I don't listen to them anymore, I make up my own mind. I will not buy an import though, buy strictly American brand. My 2015 200c has been a great car, no complaints, no problems, 39mpg highway, handles great, interior well laid out just a good solid car. Crawl underneath and see how solid this car is built and compare it with a few of the imports you will be surprised it's built heavier than almost anything in it's class. I  STILL THINK THE CAR IS GREAT.

I love the uConnect system.  So much better than anything else I've used.  The rotary shift and eParking brake are conveniently placed and add a bunch of storage under the center console.  The SafetyTec package includes all sorts of tech that still amazes me.  The ride is super quiet, it's obvious they thought a lot about reducing road noise.  

It has a high-quality feel.  The wood accents are nice, but I pay more attention to how tightly everything fits together, and Chrysler did a great job with this."

It has been awesome since day 1, Dealer serviced every 5k miles, $75 to change the oil on this car. Purchased the lifetime oil change package and an extended 7y/100k warranty. It's very good, We love driving it got the upgraded 8.4 inch screen. We love the Technology this car has and great gas mileage took a trip to Idaho from Oregon and got 38 mpg. The 9 speed transmission can be a little slow and clunky sometimes but my 6 speed fusion was very similar. I swapped out the standard noisy poor riding Ecopia tires for better Les Schwab premium tires at around 12 thousand miles, tinted the windows, The ride is very smooth and quiet, handles better. I think this car was a Good value for the money and the features are outstanding.  Even though Chrysler is stopping production of this car soon. I will be looking at probably changing vehicles in the future; but overall very happy with this vehicle so far, looks stunning. only have had to go to the dealer for the uconnect system update other than regular maintenance. very on top of that

chrysler,200,2015,Steven Wikoff, 09/06/2015,Love this 200 Limited!,5,"I have only just started driving this car as I just bought it this week, but I am in love with this car! It has everything I want and need At a very reasonable price point. I have owned many cars over the past 25 years, and they all have had their good points, but this 200 has it all in spades! There really isn't much to get excited about in the midsize sedan market, but the 200 maybe the game changer. I have been a loyal Nissan customer for 20 years. Overall I have found their vehicles to be reliable, attractive and a very good price-to-performance value. Most recently I owned a 2013 Nissan Murano and liked the car, but the mileage was terrible. I went for the bigger smoother V6 with AWD, but the gas was killing me and really much more room than I needed as primarily I used it as a commuter. So, after my car was totaled in a freak accident (nobody hurt but the car), I unexpectedly came on to the new car market. I knew I needed to downsize a bit, but I did not want a compact car, as they are just too small for my 6 foot frame. I am a little spoiled and want and expect all the bells and whistles, yet I had to have good gas mileage as I have a long commute everyday. I rented a 2015 Nissan Altima, and was fairly satisfied with it, not excited, but it felt solid, so I was going to go ahead and get it. Then I heard about the Chrysler 200. We had one of the first 300's on the market in 2005 and loved-it, but had to sell it for a mini-van for the kids. So having had a very good experience with Chrysler in the past, I decided to check out the new 200 before I bought the Altima. Am I glad I waited! The 200 blew away the Altima in every way! The body style was modern, Euro-classy, yet sporty. The interior appointments made the Nissan look cheap and even bad in comparison. When I compared the 200 Limited to the Altima S, it was a no- brainier. I would have to go up to the SV In an Altima and pay fairly more to get the same in the 200 Limited for much less cash. The only area I believe the Altima was better was the 4-cylinder engine was a bit more peppy, but not by much, and the engine noise was noticeably worse in the Nissan. The Chrysler is so much more refined and the interior fits like a glove. Chrysler was also offering fantastic incentives that made the purchase extremely attractive financially. Mileage is great, the center console system is attractive and very easy to use. It maybe the perfect commuter car ever! If you are thinking about an Altima, Accord, or Camry, do check this car out first as you may find, like I did, that it really can't be beat, and even is exciting!

chrysler,200,2015,Unhappy Chrysler Owner, 07/07/2016,Beautiful Car with Add-ons & Issues,3,"I purchased this car thinking that the bells and whistles of the vehicle would make up for the quality I had in my Dodge Charger. Within the first 30 days of owning the vehicle the transmission seemed to be shifting really hard and the radio would not work when I attempted to change stations, etc. We took it back to the dealer and they ""flashed"" the radio and then applied some update to the transmission. Within 2 months I was back again with the same issues, the same repair attempts were made. Two months later we were back again and they replaced my radio this time, then applied the same updates to the transmission. Every since then the transmission has continued to get worse with the shifting but the service department indicates that Chryslar has to tell them what to do with it.  The radio has started having the same issues and had to be repaired again as well. I understand some of the issues that are beyond the manufacturers control, like the component to the radio that seems to frequently fail but the transmission issues have almost caused me to be hit by another vehicle. This is no longer an issue but it is a safetly concern at this point. As of today the service department has submitted a request to Chryslar for guidance - we will see if anything comes from it.

It shows the Italian side of Chrysler. Kind of a Maserati look to it. After I took the test drive and saw the price, I was sold.

I bought the 200C with the V-6 and leather package which brings the Navi package. The car is built solid and definitely drives like a car $10000 higher in price. Interior is well designed and comfortable. High quality leather not the cheap material other cars have. A real looker. With it's 5 year 100k mile warranty, it's a no brainer. Me being a patriot, buying American was also a big plus. I'm shocked it isn't on the top 10 list"
chrysler,200,2015,Scott in W.PA., 11/13/2015,This Car Needs An Autobahn,5,"*** May 2016 Update 
Still purring at 18,700 miles. The good and the bad: The upper backrest of the driver's seat squeaks. Every little change in throttle and braking elicits a reminder that Chrysler needs a wee bit more development budget. The seats are brilliantly comfortable and contribute to forgetting the noise. The sunglasses holder also makes an occasional annoying rattle sound. Everything else is still awesome. Engine, AWD, fabulous dash, huge trunk and head-turning bodywork and wheels make this a truly enjoyable daily driver. A Benz owner asked me if it was a Tesla! *******



Purchased new in May '15 and have 12,250 as of Nov 1st so yes, I have piled on the miles. Traded in an aging '09 Audi A8L, so my basis for comparison is a highly ranked luxury sedan. 

Driving Dynamics
There is a bit of a mixed bag here. The star of the show is the engine. Step on it, and it pulls. Let up, step on it again, and it pulls harder. Cruising at 90 and stomping on it gets you to 110+ RIGHT NOW. It is amazing. Every bit as fast as the Audi A8L. The brakes are confident with minimal if any fade. Handling is good, not great. ""Sport"" mode seems to just make the steering feel heavier, not more inspiring. ""Sport"" mode does the usual transmission shift adjustments, and it does them very well. It also makes the car feel more like a rear-wheel driver as it disengages the traction control and makes it feel tossable. The 9 speed tranny does occasional hunting, and will sometimes stay in a lower gear going down hills. But it also turns less than 2700RPM at 110MPH. I remember my '86 GTI droning on at 3500rpm at 70mph all the way to Florida. On several Pittsburgh to Richmond trips, a rather mountainous journey, the 200S returned an unbelievable 31.5mpg, and that's with spirited driving at sustained 85+. The suspension is taught, and the 19"" wheels take a bit of the magic-carpet-ride feel away. But it is not unpleasant. Finally, there is the exhaust note. It is mean, nasty, gnarly, growlingly perfect. Perfect.

Concerns
Obviously the reliability issue rears its ugly head as we really don't know how this purring lion is going to hold up. I'm already experiencing a squeak from, of all places, the upper seat back of the drivers seat. At 6'1"" and 185lbs I am certainly not taxing the capability of the seat too much.
My other concern is the rear view mirror is so big it can actually block an SUV sitting at an intersection. I am forced to duck my head down to see under it. And yes, I've moved the seat down. 

**June 2016** Chrysler once again screwed me by announcing production is moving to Mexico and keeping their lease residuals ridiculously high on this car, so my $35k car in 18 months is now worth $16k at trade in. Thanks!! In 2001 when I bought their brand-new minivan they then sold it in fleets and my trade in percentage was even less! Sorry, but never ever again Chrysler. On the styling front, sad to say I can't distinguish the 200 from the Kia's and Huyndai's on the road. Say hello to my new Cadillac CTS4 with Performance Package that runs circles around the 200, is highly distinctive, and not an embarrassment to hand over to the valet.

**May 2017** Recently searching for a car for my daughter, I happened upon used Chrysler 200s' in the 35-50k range selling for $13-$15,000. No retained value whatsoever! Reinforces my decision to dump the 200 was a good one. Cadillac runs superbly...

**May 2018 Sorry America, your cars just don't seem to last. Goodbye, CTS and Hello another Audi A8.... a car that epitomizes fine motoring.

It feels like a luxury vehicle, fit and finish is excellent and is solid as a tank.
For those whose ownership has been a nightmare, of course they will rate it poorly. I would too if that was my experience. But go on any review site for any car, and you will see people have problems with every make and model.
I test drove both a V6 and 4 cylinder Honda Accord when deciding what to buy. The 4 cylinder was a non starter…buzzy and unrefined, IMHO. V6 Accord was merely competent. Nothing special.  
The 200 on the other hand felt like a substantial and smooth machine. I still enjoy it.
It’s one weakness is the transmission. It is not “sharp.” Shirts, while smooth are lazy. Also it’s no sportscar. But in general, I’m very happy with it. Too bad they are going to D/C the car, but so be it.

I called multiple times and was put on hold every time for so long that the sales department kept answering and retransfering me to the service department. It was winter time when i had the vehicle and the traction was terrible in the snow. The antilock brakes failed, visibility is terrible and there was front end problems. The transmission after being serviced shifted very hard in the cold weather. Fuel economy was not good at all. I was getting about 20mpg city and 29mpg highway with this car. I will never buy a Chrysler product again. I got rid of it and got a Subaru Crosstrek instead and I am glad I did because its a great vehicle.

Engine sounds good when new, beautiful style, feels much more expensive than it is, at first. Then come the never ending rattles, from door panels, pillar panels, vibrations of the engine making cups rattle in the cup holders. The 4 cylinder engine that now sounds like it has a heavy piston tap when at idle in gear with the AC on. ( Don't worry they say, that's the 'Multi Air' System its perfectly normal.) Then comes the real problem, the transmission. Driving the car in the 500 mile ""re-learn"" period after they ""update/flash/reset"" the car drives as normal as it can with so many gears. Once it ""learns your driving"" ( I don't race my car, I drive like a responsible adult, however racing it around like an idiot does make the car seem a bit more normal) the transmission does have a number of lovely added features such as; sudden lunges when downshifting, getting stuck in 3rd gear when coming to a stop to prevent you from accelerating normally through an intersection, half way through it will suddenly drop the transmission into second giving you burst of acceleration (almost like you have turbo lag accompanied by horrendous noise ) , loss of power while making a U-turn on busy roads, lunging forward into garage walls once its put in park. Harsh shifts, are a common experience with this car, if you decide to buy it know that you will often feel like someone is kicking you under your seat as you are driving down the road. You will also experience the loving surge the car has acquired since the last ""reset"" when cruising along at any consistent speed in 4th or 7th gear. I've decided it must be part of a driver alertness package my car wasn't purchased with. Thanks Chrysler for the free upgrade... The car has also had its fair share of ""phantoms"" with the 8.4 Uconnect system,  AC couldn't be controlled, freezing when phone was plugged in to the USB port, now randomly the ghost of Chryslers past (hackers) have come out to allow the Uconnect to mess with my phone if it is plugged into the USB system. I can tell the car to be on radio and it will shift back to play my phone every 2-3 minutes. If i need to charge my phone now I drive in silence with my phone turned off as well. You will meet many new people with your Chrysler 200, if its anything like mine the 10 visits to service in the 15k miles (nearly every 1500 miles, but whos counting I love being without my car, or a loaner) have allowed me to meet nearly every service advisor at both dealerships with in 35 miles of my house. In addition to talking with  number of agents working at Chrysler Customer Care. My newest introduction was to a lovely lady named TRIVIA who works for the customer resolutions department, in a review of Lemon Law dispute with the car. She has a wonderful habit of not answering ANY phone calls, returns voicemails when its convenient and makes appointments with you (at your request) for phone calls which she never makes, or takes when you call her at said time. She must be incredibly overworked at Chrysler in light of the companies poor build quality, and poor customer service standards. It all makes sense now why Chrysler is discontinuing the 200 and Dart. The company will be bleeding money by the time they are done with recalls/ buybacks/ and bad public relations but America will just bail them out again... Your Tax dollars hard at work.

The guys at the dealer know me by name as I've been there so frequently. Got a minute? I'll start the list of things I've been dealing with with this nightmare of a car. First, there's been at least 3 recalls which I had to waste my time taking to the dealer to get fixed, but okay, not too upset about that. Next the radio needed to be repaired once, and then replaced the second time it crapped out on me (I have the full package, navigation etc.). Again, I was pleased with the interior design of the car, and accepted that this ""is what it is."" However, what I'm still dealing with is this horrible 9 speed transmission! My car is currently at the dealer being fixed for the FOURTH TIME, for the same issue! The car jerks going from park to reverse or drive, jerks again going from first to second and back down to first, and they just don't seem to have the answer to how to fix it. First time I brought it back, they claimed to have fixed it. A few weeks later, same issue. Brought it back,"" and they attempted to fix it again. Before I left the parking lot of the dealer I was just playing with the gears to test it out, SAME ISSUE! I walked right back inside and said I'm not accepting this car. They took it back in and ultimately replaced the tranny. Now about two months later the problem is back and even worse. I'm about to get a third transmission and the car has less than 25,000 miles on it! The WORST part about this whole ordeal is that the last time they needed to take my $30,000 car for a week for repair, the rental I received was a $17,000 Hyundai Accent. And now they have me in a Chevrolet Spark! (If you don't know, this is Chevy's Smart car) I contacted Chrysler's Corporate and they assured me they would work with my dealer to give me an adequate fix to the car this time (4th times a charm I guess). They also said they would do their best to influence the dealer to put me in a nicer rental, and I ended up with a clown car! So, what do you guys think? You think I can trust that my car will be completely fixed this time around? If I dare brought up that I wanted some type of reimbursement for the fact that I keep being put in a car that is far from what I pay for, they say they cannot help me. I'm just so aggregated, and I'd say rightfully so. Chrysler, I ask you, is this how you stand behind your product? Do you expect to retain customers this way? I used to have a Dodge Charger, and I wanted a Jeep next, and now I think I have to stay away.

I have learned to put the transmission selector in Sport mode when I need responsiveness. I love the fuel economy. I love the power, especially in sport mode.  Everything else is excellent.

chrysler,200,2015,R/T, 05/17/2018,Bring back the Chrysler 200!,5,"I owned a 2013 Chrysler 200 and when I saw the re-styled 2015 models , I had to have one!  I did my research on the cars before I made my purchase. Make SURE you get the 3.6/V-6, NOT the 4 cylinder.  The V-6 pumps out 295 HP that has more HP than a Suburau WRX, which only has 286 HP. Also find a car with the ALPINE 9 speaker 506 watt sound system with the 8.4 U-connect touch screen NAV. (Navigation-Sound Group 1) With my Sirius XM subscription, the touch screen offers a current weather map with forecast/severe weather warnings and nearby gas prices!  I also have the ""Comfort Group""  that has heated seats, steering wheel & remote start.  What is AWESOME during winter months,  when you auto start the car, it automatically activates the heated seats, steering wheel & ups the blower speed on the fan control so your ride is TOASTY when you enter!  Also, you can keep your FOB in your pocket or purse and when you get near the car and place your hand on the door handle, it's unlocks automatically so you don't have to fumble around to open it!   I have the 200 S  model that has the 19"" Hyper Black factory rims with stiffer sport suspension and my choice of vivid pearl blue clearcoat and people don't know if my car is an Audi or a BMW! (snicker)  Let me tell you that V-6  is freaky fast with the 9-speed trans.  Some people complained of ""hard shifting""  which can be fixed with a re-flash at the dealer and the trans will adapt to how ""you"" drive and not the previous owner. (I had that done)  Yes, the back seat is door area is small for adults but this is my personal car and have no problem with that issue. Furthermore, most ""newer"" cars recommend full synthetic oil in their engine designs but thanks to  FCA engineers , only regular conventional oil is required saving $$$ on oil changes!  The front seats  are nice and comfy and the Alpine sound system has a ""surround sound"" mode placing you in a concert hall while motoring around and the 8"" factory subwoofer thumps pretty decent.  I put 3K on my car so far and I LOVE it!    FCA Sergio Marchionne made a mistake by ending production of this car.  FCA should have done a better job in marketing this car to the public by comparing the quickness and sporty lines of the 200 to Audi, BMW and the Suburau WRX as mentioned earlier.  The younger generation would have jumped on this choice of car big time, by advertising the 200's prowess as a sporty racing machine and not a droopy 4 cylinder grocery getter......

chrysler,200,2015,Robert Benson, 11/27/2016,Perfect Car !!,5,"The Chrysler 200C is a dynamic vehicle.  The V6 powered car supplies more performance, and fun, than most people will ever use. Zippy, while still averaging around 27mpg at 75mph trips, with 23 around town. Fit and finish is superb, the upgraded leather premium has to be seen to really appreciate.  The Mocha brown is as good as anything you will find in the car market - regardless of price.  The road handling is perfect.  The car with the forward anti-collision, distance control cruise control, self parking, has to be used to be truly appreciated. A really great car, best buy out there - bar none.

I average on a regular basis 25 mpg in town and 31 on the highway. She handles nicely hugs the road fine. I love the smooth shifting of a nine speed transmission, especially when going up hill never loses power and will respond if you need a little more power to pass its great.

The only things I'm slightly bummed about is the fact that the panoramic moon ruff doesn't actually open all the way up.  The other thing that bothered me a bit is that the S trim doesn't automatically come with the bigger touch screen radio, but I purchased this vehicle pre-owned so I'm not sure if these things were what the previous owner requested or if its just how it comes.  It also runs on E85 which is always dirt cheap:-)

chrysler,200,2015,Joe, 03/15/2016,Chrysler 200S,3,"Well I purchased this 200s my 1st new car in 10 years at first I was very excited to replace my old ""06 Sebring with this new powerful 3.7L pinta star powered 200s
first the engine is very fast and powerful no problem there, the 9 speed trans, well it needs a little, the 8.4"" display is really nice and I liked the nav system the heater controls are a mixed bag you have to use the display and the external controls to work the climate system you have to look at the display and select to work all the functions you have to take your eyes off the road and that is not a good thing just to change the heater controls, the comfort and ride is where this car really failed me, the leather seats are fancy but very hard and very uncomfortable, and the ride is very harsh and very uncomfortable after 30min. on the highway I had to pull over I could not take it anymore and the 38psi low profile tires id not help the situation. After owning the car for 4 weeks I traded it back in lost a bunch of money on it. I purchased a new 2015 Chevy Malibu and I am much happier with it.

chrysler,200,2015,Larry I, 03/25/2016,"Close to BMW, but not there - unsafe at high speed",3,"There are definitely similarities to the BMW. But overall, it's just not there yet. There is an emphasis on outward style, without the inside matching what is outside. Yet, there are definitely things about this car that excel. Driving in slow traffic is easy. The acceleration is good. Visibility with the side mirrors is excellent. But it's simply not as refined as the BMW/Mercedes standard. It's the little things. Some things are unnecessary. Like the cruise control that tells you that it's ready to put the cruise control on. BMW and others have a symbol. That's all that's really necessary. The rear window visibility is poor. The acceleration on the vehicle is excellent, but not quite BMW. The main difference, though, and what makes this very American, is that driving at speeds higher than 60 or 70 in this car is dangerous and unstable. This is typical of American cars. It has electronic steering, which makes it very easy to steer and turn when making turns when backing in and out and in parking situations. But unfortunately, this translates to sloppy and dangerous steering at high speeds. You have to keep your hands on the wheel. You can feel the car go from side to side when you just turn the steering wheel very little, for example, when driving at 60 or 70. It's unacceptable. Because BMW and Mercedes have designed their cars to travel safely at high speeds for decades, it's not a big deal. But for American cars, this is make or break. There are some cars that do well at this. But not many of them are American. And this car is not one of them.

chrysler,200,2015,dccarshopper@gmail.com, 10/29/2015,Rating from a long time Honda/Acura Owner,4,"Totaled my Acura RL on the highway. This rating is based on a car rental of the Chrysler 200 for 2.5 weeks. I am a long time Japanese car driver. I have rented Ford Mustangs, driven Ford Fusions ect. I never thought once about a Chrysler and this is the first time I have driven one in my life. I have driven some american made cars like Ford Taurus, Pontiac Grand Am.  I have driven Lexus, bmw.
I have to say, for a medium size sedan this car has decent acceleration, the drive is nice and the interior and body styling has a nice clean look. It does not have as much horsepower as my rl. But for a 4 cylinder this car can go when you need it to in traffic. I saw one on the road earlier this year and thought it looked great. 
I really thought this car was the size of my wife's civic. But, when I parked next to it, the car is almost the size of a Honda Accord. It takes up more space in my garage than the RL. The exterior body style has some bold and larger shapes to it than I am used to. So it throws me off a little when I try parking it. That is just a personal thing that one can get used to easily. 
The voice commands are easy to follow. The technology in this car is also easy to figure out rather quickly. Without reading any manual I figured out bluetooth, radio, media, voice calling ect. It is much easier to figure out than the Ford Fusion, which I am still baffled about. I didn't have time to read the owners manual driving 100 plus miles per day sometimes. 
I drove this car 1500 miles in 2 weeks. So, I put it to the test. The one thing I found quirky was in the voice command it is difficult to navigate to send a text message. It is easy to respond to one. But it asked me for some predefined responses to incoming text messages sometimes. And then sometimes the voice commands work, sometimes it shuts off and makes a weird noise.  I think this all could be cleared up if I had time to read the book. But for the most part, the systems in the car were easy to figure out. And this is my first upgraded car with newer wireless and blue tooth since 2004. The model was  a 2002 I last owned. Last new car we bought was in 2010. Cars have come a long way.
Cons: the hazard light button is directly underneath the center graphic console where you access the radio/ media source ect. I found that while i was fidgeting in traffic with the radio the hazard lights would come on. I probably turned them on by accident about 15 times over the course of two weeks. They need to move that somewhere further away from a high traffic hand area. The other part that I don't necessarily like is the compartment that is underneath the console in the middle of the front seats. It is hidden underneath and a little difficult to access. Especially when I commute nearly 3 hours a day. I need to pay full attention all the time I am driving so this is not the best place for a compartment when i need to grab things. However, it does have a nice slick look to where you can't see that console. So, function is my main priority, but if you like slick looks then it does look very nice.
Last thing I disliked, I felt like there was a lack of areas to put things I need access to. I commute a ton so I have to bring a bunch of things with me. I had piles of stuff on top of every surface. Even the cup holders that had cups in them had things piled on them. And when the wife took a ride I had to take the entire seat full of things out. The other cars ive owned have had bigger center consoles along with a slightly better thought out configuration that is a little more space efficient. Not a huge biggie for everyone. But when I drive hours to job sites. I need ease of access and efficiency. 
One thing I will say though, when I was younger I would have been in the market for a car more like this. I would say 20s to 30s. I can take a guess on price and personally I think this is  a great
 car for the money. The interior I had only had some trim leather. The seats were fabric but the wheel and some other areas had leather. The seats were very comfortable. The black powder coated metal along with the chrome accent inside has a really nice look to it. Aesthetically, this car is really nice. Even though much of the interior is plastic, the designers thought it out. 
The positives far outweigh the negatives and I feel this is a great family car. This rental has  given me a great first impression of Chrysler.  I never really thought much about a chrysler or even contemplated ever driving one. I will say, this makes me want to test drive a Chrysler 300. The new styles they have out look very slick. It is one of the best looking cars on the road.  
The entire time I was test driving hybrids due to needing great epa for the driving. I drove a brand new 2016 Ford Fusion Hybrid. This is also a very nice car, drives well and has a nice slick look. I think both the chrysler and Fusion have a really nice look to the body style.  The car is peppy and fun.

chrysler,200,2015,Kheareh, 03/11/2019,2015 chrysler 200C is a lemon,1,"I bought my car brand new and immediately starting having problems with it just stopping with no warning on the highway and on the street the dealership was initially unable to fix it they kept saying there wasn't anything wrong with the car and they also would not buy it back. They finally realized it was some type of harness. I got my car back and continued to have the same issues. They finally replace the transmission. When I had my brother in law who is mechanic look at it he said they didn't bolt the transmission down at the dealership. now I am currently having engine issues and going toward the end of my warranty my car has been in the shop 4 times for engine issues this year but they refuse to replace the engine and chrysler corporate is no help. This car is very unreliable and the dealerships ( Stateline Chrysler Jeep Dodge as well as Roseville Chrysler Jeep RAM) also do shoddy work. There was a woman who I spoke with last year from Chrysler corporate that was very rude and told me they already extended my warranty they would not give me anything else.

Bought the car with 9k miles 3 years ago and it now has 43k. It has been so much fun and hasn't cost me a dime other than oil changes and tires. The AWD makes this car a beast in the snow! The 3.6L engine is healthy and moves the car nicely while using minimal gas. Averages 35mpg(hwy) & 25mpg(city) in normal conditions. Not quite ""fast"", but quick and it handles well for it's class. Over-all I would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone who wants a sedan that is fun, reliable, and cheap to own!

The Carfax didn't show the 2 recalls on the car when we bought it. It's been in the shop for repair at least 10 times for updates, modules, trans, ignition issues, radio, key fobs, and brakes. Now we're stuck because it can't be considered a lemon because we got it used. I feel like I'm being robbed everytime I pay me car note.

chrysler,200,2015,honestreview2, 05/31/2015,"2.4 is ""a pleasant surprise""",4,"Only reason I am giving a 4 for reliability is because of Chrysler's previous track record with this car. So far I have had 0 issues. I saw the 200's when they came out and loved the new styling. I'll admit it is a bit conservative but I think that's what gives it more of a classy look rather than a more aggressive look that will not age well. Originally I was going to get the 200s with the V6 for that tremendous power, but after comparing the two, I preferred the way the 4 cylinder composed itself and handled. Even though the 200's 0-60 is 9 sec, in normal driving it feels much more powerful and very smooth. The transmission was a little quirky at first but after break in it smoothed out.

They claimed it only needed an update. Three days later I had it home. A month later the Transmission overheating light came on. Back to the shop. They ""couldn't replicate error"". Two months later engine light was back on. Replaced sensor. Six weeks later transmission overheating light back on. I had this car just over 16 months, and had warning lights come on five times. I ended up trading it in with only 27k miles on it. Transmission light came on again when we were heading to the dealer to trade it in. Some people are claiming this is the cat's meow. That it is only happening in the 4 cylinder etc etc. Be very wary of those claims.   Pros: Handles well in all weather. Three body trunk. Cons: passenger wiper stops right in front of the driver's eyes, very short headlight distance in low beams, surges while slowing down, rearview mirror blocks a huge part of right side of windshield. Tons of blind spots.  Engine and transmission issues galore.

chrysler,200,2015,james, 12/16/2015,missed the mark,3,"I never was a Chrysler guy.. nore imagined me considering one.. after all my research I kept going back to this Chrysler 200 limited just something about its look but price point.. now first my intial test drive was a good experience.. The car has the means to fit anyones needs..Now I do wish this car had more room to breath with power the 4cyl 2.4 def has the get up an go but the 9 speed tranny really holds it back and keeps it clunky more than 40 per of the time.. taking corners can be alittle sketchy but overall not to bad.. road noise was good and it glides over imperfections in the road..I really wasn't a thrilled owner after 3 weeks of having the car and at barely 600 miles I had to send car in for a new tranny and headliner due to it buckled and creased front to back on driver side.. I was startingto think this was a bad purchase.. but I took a breath and figured all new cars have there hickups from time to time.. but now with the new tranny in I started to notice even more roughness with the tranny esp when coming to a stop it seems to want to buck u around like a bull at a rodeo now Chrysler says this is normal for this style and not to worry.. kinda makes you wonder with that response..now entering the car can be tricky esp if your a tall person.. I'm only 5'7 and have hit my head couple times already.. the a beams are very oversized and can block your view..  fuel economy isn't bad currently getting 33.6 highway so not far off from there projected 36.. rear seats and legroom.. this Is where your eyes can play tricks til you actually get in.. and tend to notice foot room is bare minimal and comfort lacks just alittle...My overall rating on this would be 6 out of 10.. style is great but I'm very unsure if Chrysler should stick with there 9 speed tranny.. For the money not bad but sometimes i wonder am i really getting what i truly thought i was.. guess only time will tell..

Chrysler refuses to stand by their product (piece of junk). Went through the channels, customer care etc... got hung up on, mistreated on the phone and in general every single person involved had a lack of empathy towards the situation. I told them if they wouldnt stand by their own product, how could anyone else? They will not stand by their product, so neither am I.

I have a 2016, 3 days after purchasing the car a light came on. The CPU went out, they had to replace that. Within one year of having the car a heating module when out, the ignition coil went out, the airbag sensor malfunctioned, the car required SEVERAL updates, the transmission has issues and Chrysler has place this in writing on one of my invoices, but refused to fix the issue. The transmission jumps, stalls or skips gears when you are placing it out of park.  As you are driving the transmission will jerk, the whole car. The last incident that took me over the edge was the car started to rust, and they tried to say it was my fault, but the rust was under the paint, which meant it was a manufacturer issue. They gave me the run around for months before Chrysler approved the fix, this is after they received the pictures from the dealer.  I had to fight with them for approximately THREE months. Not to mention the dealership placed a false claim on my warranty and I had to terminate my relationship with them. I have had random strangers stopping me at lights, gas stations and, grocery stores inquiring if I had issues with my car and informing me of their woes. The dealerships, the customer service, the headquarters are all garbage, Chrysler will not stand behind their products and provide mediocre customer service.  I am telling you now DO NOT BUY THIS CAR!!! You will regret it...worst decision ever. I will never buy anything under the Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep umbrella EVER AGAIN!

A great car until the SECOND transmission went out at 156k, so on to the Germans for me. Tiring of $1000 repair bills every visit, I rolled the dice on a 2015 200S with every option sans LED lights and adaptive cruise. We'll be piling on the highway miles over the next 3 years, so the claimed 29mpg for an AWD vehicle sold me. The only other AWD sedan that came close was the Subaru Legacy, larger interior, more safety features, but it was an absolute dog on the highway. Got 18% off sticker and the ext warr for half price: made them throw in the True Coat (see: Fargo, the movie).

***Last Update*** Resale value in the toilet.....thanks, Chrysler for your draconian lease terms driving buyers away in hoards. Traded in for a Cadillac CTS4 which is just better in every department (except fuel mileage, and I can certainly live with that).

Lastest Update*** American iron couldn't hack it, so back to the Germans. My Audi A8 4.0T twin-turbo V8 is magnificent!

Before 6000 miles got recall to replace entire trans-axle unit; however, Chrysler advised it would be six months minimum before providing replacement unit. My car could not be driven but Chrysler had plenty of units for their ""state of the art"" assembly line. After much ado we managed to shorten time to about six weeks. 10/23/15 received recall on connector which may stall engine or shift tranny to neutral while underway with no warning. Chrysler has known of this since 2/13/15 according to NHTSA but still no part to correct this dangerous  situation.  Based on conversations and performance I am convinced their priority is assembly and sales- not the well being of those who purchased their product in good faith. This has been my worst new auto experience in my 70 years of life . Sorry for the wordiness but this is the SHORT version.  12/11/2016.  We've had four recalls so far and other issues as well.

chrysler,200,2015,Brendon N., 02/28/2018,Biggest Regret of my Life,1,"When I took the car off the lot for a test drive. It seemed adequately powered and comfortable. The back seat at the time was a non-factor, it was really where I just tossed miscellaneous items. I was impressed with the ease of which the infotainment and driver-assistance features worked. In fact, I think it's the best controls and layout I've ever used in a car. It's so simple, clean, and easy. Honestly, I wish I could rip off the center console and put it in a Ford to combat their tiny buttons and confusing features. This car is floaty. Every bump keeps me moving for seconds after. This car, at the end of the day, has its natural habitat on the back of a flatbed. I should've foreseen it. The first week I owned it, my friend hopped in the passenger seat and realized the floor was soaked. The A/C system was leaking from under the glovebox. Once that was fixed, I ran into more serious problems with the car's computer systems. I had to be towed when my car wouldn't get out of first gear. In a 6-speed, I could limp to a dealership. In a 9-speed, that first gear only just gets you going. I was revving in the red going 12 mph. But hey, that was the one time the car was actually moving with one of these problems. The other THREE times it ended up on a flatbed, I couldn't get the car out of park and all these errors were popping up on the driver's display. I'd be the first to admit I drive a lot. I have nearly 70k miles on this car of mostly long road trip thruway miles. But every time I approach the car now, I wonder if it'll start, get into gear, and get me to my destination. Not comforting. I've doubled my car payment and am looking to sell as soon as it's worth more than I owe. Can't wait.

chrysler,200,2015,John Donaldson, 11/15/2015,Rented for a week,2,"I found the Chrysler 200 4Cyl to have noticeable shift points, poor gas pedal response, poorly placed controls (shift knob, headlight switch), the sound system turned on every time I started the car even though I turned it off previously. The rental car lacked basic features of most large cars today such as Auto climate controls.

Trunk space was adequate, engine power was good after a lag when depressing the gas pedal.

The driver's headrest was about 1"" too far forward for me, making this the drop dead feature for me not to buy a Chrysler 200.

I would not recommend this car for purchase or lease.

chrysler,200,2015,MoePar Bob, 10/18/2016,Problems were not with the V6!,4,"Most of the bad transmission issues were with the 4 Cylinder, using the 9 speed transmission.  Just opt for the bigger engine if buying used.  The higher S and C packages equipped with the V6 and the same 9 speed transmisisons seemed to have mostly 'Dodged' this issue, pun intended.  I still am taking my V6 in to the dealer (unavailable until late October) for the recall maintenance, just to be sure.  The interior and electronics are top notch, especially the upgraded Alpine sound system.  Safety Package (adaptive cruise control, blind spot monitor, lane departure warnings) were valuable included features.  The engine is punchy and provides the power you want and need, but is not anything meant to be ""sports car worthy"" as this is the ""luxury minded"" Dodge branding.  The exterior look and design are what sold me on the car, the rest was icing on the cake.  Me and my wife literally fit inside the trunk (long held cargo space test we use) and we liked the two front seat compartments and additional (lockable) glove box.  Have only had the car for about a month, so no long drives or use of the Navigation yet... but all seem fine.  Yes a 9 speed transmission will have you ramping up and down into many gears at a time, but I wouldn't describe it as ""jerky"".  Resale value on these things suck, but that's mostly due to the stink from the 4 cylinders ruining the great job they did withthe V6's.  I would scrap the 4 cylinder option alltogether... I mean that's what Chevy did with the Impala's and that seemed to work out fine.

chrysler,200,2015,Joe, 06/07/2017,Maybe the worst car I've ever driven,1,"I rented this car through Hertz, and I've had it for three months. In that time I've come to loathe it to the extent that when I see another person driving one I want to pull up next to them and scream ""why?!"". I'll do the features I like first to get them out of the way: the center console and USB ports are well designed, the car unlocking when you touch the driver's side door handle is nice, and the volume control toggle on the steering wheel is cool. Now for the bad: I'm 6'4"" and I can't sit up straight in any of the seats, there are so many blind spots it's actually terrifying to change lanes, the transmission is weird and finicky and the RPMs jump up to 5,000 when going down even a small hill (also if you want to switch from drive to reverse while making a three point turn the reverse won't engage for a couple seconds), all the knobs in the middle console, including the gear shifter are the same size, so it's easy to throw the car into neutral on the freeway if you want to turn the AC down, the temperature controls are buttons so you have to hold them down forever if you want to change the car's climate, the AC also either blows too much or not enough, there's a button on the steering wheel to do voice activated phone calls and if you hit it on accident it goes ""THERE ARE NO PHONES CONNECTED"" super loud over the speakers and takes ten seconds before the music starts playing again, the interior lights and headlights stay on for way too long when you get in the car and don't turn it on, there's no CD player, the backup camera screen is tiny, the car automatically locks when you start driving so you have to constantly unlock it, and it gets terrible gas mileage.

Enterprise gave me this 200 for a 6 week duration and I absolutely hate it. The transmission in this vehicle had me scared the car was damaged, but apparently that is just how these transmissions are. Beware of the slew of knobs - including the gear select - that are all huddled together as well. I have also been having an issue with keeping the car at a steady speed on the PA Turnpike, the gear ratios seem seem to lag around and be unpredictable.  It is just a really cheap vehicle, I understand it is a mid-size and is not intended to be my TL, but this thing is just a cheap mess of bad build materials and quality, poor mechanics, and poor ergonomics.

I have had some American models but through this Chrysler 200 LX 2.4L is just a low type of vehicle I ever had. I do like the interior, lights systems, and instrumentals. However,  the engine handles not really good on the highway especially on the high speed (70mph+). I thought it is heavy type of sedan it should of handle pretty good, but nope it can't even beat 2.0L Ford Focus SE. Well, it is Ford so it might sound worse about how the appearance looks, but Ford now is a lot better and changed to the way the world supposed to.
This 200 does give a hesitate during idling basically on the service road speeds, while you are stuck in the traffic, then when you try to idling to maintain speed, it's just immediately, woof out of no where that almost hit the car in front of it.

chrysler,200,2015,Nitrous15!, 08/01/2015,meh,3,"The 200 has a nice look and room enough inside but underwhelms in performance, fuel efficiency and the stereo with the uconnect system is kind of lame.  So much sub but not enough power from smaller speakers makes bass heavy songs hard to enjoy.  I'm an audiophile so this really irritates me, may not be as big of a deal for others.  The distance between city and hwy mpg is pretty serious, about 19-22 in city and 28-40 on freeway (depends on incline/grade).  The 200 also suffers from a jankey throttle response.  I'll lightly press on the pedal and get nothing, a slight press drops gears fast and pulls you a bit abruptly.  Not fun.

I’m guessing that sales were not too good because the 200 is discontinued. This is a great car.
It is a 2015, not 2016

Car has had several wheel problems. The 19”wheels look nice but are horrible. They bend, crack and scratch very easily. Way to expensive to keep repairing/ replacing. Thank God i purchased the insurance. The “lug” nuts are not nuts but post. They swell and can’t be taken off without breaking. Don’t get a flat (which is almost impossible with the horrible wheels) because you may not be able to get the lugs off. Called Chrysler and they were very pleasant but say there is no problem. There is absolutely a problem and a dangerous one. If you can’t replace a tire you may be in big trouble. Traded it in.

chrysler,200,2016,amw0426, 11/23/2018,NOTHING but problems starting at 20k miles!,1,"This vehicle has had issue after issue.  It began with horrible shifting and jerking of the transmission - causing me to think I'd been rear-ended on several occasions due to the severe jolt. The problem could not be replicated the first couple of times I took it in for service at the dealership. -Though it happens EVERY time I drive. Finally, after the third or fourth time I took it in - I was informed that ALL FOUR MOTOR MOUNTS WERE BROKEN! They believed me at that point! They re-flashed the software and said it was fixed. It was not. I was forced to pay a $100 deductible so that it would be covered under the warranty later on. It made no sense to me, but I paid it anyway.  

Since then, this 2016 vehicle - has had NOTHING but problems. 
Transmission problems - continuous
Thermostat had to be replaced
Bad airbags and constant notification alert and light - occured at 37k miles (1k post warranty coverage!) $126 for them to tell me it would be a $500+ fix
Compressor came apart internally
Condenser went out
Serpentine belt broke
Wheel hubs - all four are going out according to the dealership - no doubt this is due to the havoc the jerking of the transmission causes.
NOW: The starter went out two days ago and smoke billowed from under the hood at the same time. The dealerships wants to charge me $1000 to replace the starter so that THEN they can determine what else is wrong and caused the smoke and noise while driving to work that morning. Plus the fee for diagnosis of approx $150.
I've since contacted Chrysler and an agent will get back to me on Tues or Wed of next week. Meanwhile, I have no car, nor a loaner vehicle since the dealership didn't have any available. I was informed I could rent a car and be reimbursed as applicable - so, if that means if they decide to.
"
chrysler,200,2016,Brian, 06/13/2016,Great car,5,"I really hesitated buying this car given the reviews of the 2015 and the transmission issues people reported; even with over $10,000 in discounts and incentives.  Eventually I had enough of my Elantra and figured I'd go for it.  I am VERY glad I did.  There really is a lot to like in this car.  It rides great, it's very comfortable, and the gas mileage is remarkable.  I'm getting 33 mpg in mixed driving.  

Some of the drawbacks are there.  You have to duck a bit to get in because of the styling, but my Elantra had similar styling so I'm used to that.  The rear seat has a little less leg room than the rest of the class, but the only person I regularly put back there is my 9 year old daughter and she's comfortable so that's not a problem for me.  If you have a couple of 6 ft. plus people you regular carry back there make sure you bring them on the test drive.  Also, the A pillar is a little bulky, but it was so big on the Elantra that I could have lot an elephant in it, so again, I'm used to it.

The only picky issue I would change is that each time you drive it you have to turn the cruise control on.  It would be nice if it stayed on.

It seems that Chrysler has mostly solved the transmission issues or I was lucky enough to get a good one as mine shifts smoothly and most shifts are imperceptible.  Shifting from first to second at low speeds can be a little bigger of an ordeal than necessary, but not so much as to go online and complain about it.

Chrysler's issue as I see it, is that they're always in a hurry.  Back in the 80's they NEEDED the minivan to keep the company afloat.  Then in the mid 2000's they NEEDED the 300 to keep going, and a couple years ago it seems they felt they NEEDED the 200.  Because of that rush there were some regular mechanical issues with the 2015 that could have been solved by waiting 6 months to launch the vehicle.  Now it would seem that either I have a good one, or those problems are mostly behind it.  From my experience with my 2016 I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone from a quality standpoint.....but ask me again in 50,000 miles, and again 50,000 miles after that.

It's not a perfect car but it is a pretty good one and it fits me and my family just fine.  Especially given the ENORMOUS rebates available now you owe it to yourself to go drive one if you are considering a mid size car.  Just remember with huge rebates comes huge depreciation.  Get gap insurance and plan to keep it for the long haul.

UPDATE 8/20/16:
I have about 4500 miles on the car and I wanted to update my review.  Everything is still going great with my 200.  Some of the drawbacks are still there; the rear seat didn't get any roomier, but my daughter didn't get much bigger either.  I still have to dip down a bit when i get in, but it's still not a big deal to me.  The cruise control switch still doesn't stay on when you turn the car off, but I've mostly gotten used to it.  Overall it's still doing great.  

I had mentioned that some shifts could be rough and indeed they still can be.  The switch from park to drive can be a bit rough.  Generally however I have gotten used to how to apply the throttle to mitigate most of the rough shifts.  It's a quirk but one that is generally manageable. 

That's something I'd like to expand upon.  The 200 may not have the best test results at the track and because of that it doesn't get great reviews by the experts, but for day to day, go to the grocery store, go to the golf course, drive to work needs, it's perfectly fine.  Some of the quirks are noticeable on a test drive, but are something I've gotten used to and not something I would even consider a problem at all.  I dare say that if I gave you my keys for a week you would notice some quirks immediately, but after the week is over most would not be a huge issue.  Some things may be, if you regularly shuttle around tall folks in
 the back it may not be the car for you, but overall I think 90% of people will find that it meets 90% of their needs.  

No maintenance issues except I'm going in for my 5K service shortly.  And gas mileage is still great; generally around 32-33 combined and easily pushing if not exceeding 40 on the highway.

Overall still going great especially for getting such a great deal; over 10K off the sticker price.  I'll try to keep updating this review, maybe at 10K intervals or so.

chrysler,200,2016,Bill Tabor, 07/24/2016,A Sporty Sedan That Delivers,4,"Had just purchased this vehicle on July 15th 2016, and at time of purchase really didn't know much about it, but considering the great looks inside and out, a great warranty, and of all the bells/ whistles this vehicles came with, although a little more expensive than the Ford Fusion and other vehicles in its' class, its' cost was justified depending on what you were looking for in a new sedan. The exterior of vehicle is sporty and luxurious in appearance, great body fit, and a flawlessly applied metallic clear coat paint job, not the case of which I ran in to w/ other new vehicles that I've purchased in the past.  Entering the vehicle can be a tight situation depending on your height, this is due to the 200 sedans low roof line which is low/ slopped, and further creating a space/ headroom problem once inside the vehicle for driver/ passengers six feet and taller.  Once inside/ seated I found the design and quality of materials used to make up same was of higher quality vs. competitors, again it was a mix of sport/ luxury which complimented overall appearance of vehicle inside/ out.  The seating was very comfortable and supportive, and making long drives less stressful and satisfying, and short drives fun.  The dash/ console are cockpit like design, and a dial for gear selection inspired by jaguar has taken the place of the traditional hand shifter.  Placement of instrumentation is good, all is within easy sight for driver.  Lighting of same is a nice touch that is easy on the eyes/ enhances the driving experience when driving at night.  What I am disappointed in are the speakers for stereo, I love music and these speakers are only adequate, I soon plan to replace them w/ aftermarket speakers of higher quality/ function. The sliding arm rest on nice sized floor console between driver/ passenger was a nice touch/ convenient, and since my limited lacked to presence of a cd player inside the console will be the right place for me to have one installed. Noise level inside passenger compartment while in operation is near zero other than the normal/ anticipated road noise of tires which is hard to muffle on any vehicle.  Wind noise is absent, ride is super smooth, steering precise along w/ a good feel for the road. Yes, the interior of the Chrysler 200 is smaller/ cramped than Ford Fusion and others, but once inside it's a great driving experience, up-scaled and nice to be in depending on what you're looking for in a sedan as this sedan is not for everyone. Trunk space is large for a sedan of this size, and just getting back to one more exterior feature that I love is the projection headlights that automatically self adjust for night-time driving.  Despite past complaints of the 2015 200 sedan of computer improperly processing commands to the 9 speed automatic transmission while in operation and creating an unpredictable driving experience, ie; lack of acceleration, hesitation of transmission to shift and adjust to normal driving conditions during city/ highway driving, for 2016 it appears Chrysler did correct this matter as from a standing stop from 0-50 mph my 4 cylinders performance is normal/ adequate, and while highway driving the 4 cylinder has more than enough power thanks to the 9-speed automatic, rpm's remain low, top speeds can be unthinkable, drive one and see.  But in ending keep in mind this is not a muscle car and expectations may vary as to performance standard of others.  To me the 4 cylinder engine is ample and responsive, it provides good performance for what it is intended.  If you want more power in this sedan the V-6 comes highly recommended, the call is yours to make, drive one and see.  Although new, I'll remain optimistic of my purchase and overall experience, this is one nice sports sedan that turns heads and meets my present expectations, I would recommend this vehicle to a friend.

chrysler,200,2016,oldschool3000, 07/14/2016,My 2016 200 limited has the V6 not listed,5,"This car is really handsome.  I bought it from an Audi dealer where it was used as a courtesy car.  Only has 2,600 miles on it and looks brand new.  I really like it.  Mine is black with black.  On the Audi lot it fit in so well among the Audis I couldn't find it when I first showed up to look at it!  The interior is stunning.  I have the moon roof and the largest touchscreen, too.  This is the 90th Anniversary Model.  The seats are cloth but have a very high end look as well.  I did a lot of research before selecting the 200 Limited.  As far as the 9 speed transmission is concerned, my works just fine.  I think issues people seem to be having are more with the 4 cylinder engine which may not have enough torque to really power this tranny.  Another possible explanation could be that we just aren't used to a 9 speed.  It definitely is a different experience than a traditional 5 speed.  The point of this design is fuel economy.  The trans uses the highest gear possible to have the engine run at the lowest RPM possible.   I took it up to 90MPH for a short spell and the tach read 1400 RPM.  There is a slight lag if you suddenly jam down on the gas from cruise speed but the trans sorts it out quickly and let me tell you, it is one powerful engine!  Goes like a mother.  The engine is very quiet at low speed but when you punch it, it lets off a great sounding snarl!   The best part so far for me is that I rarely see another one on the road despite traveling 50 miles per day to and from work.

Follow up: It is now June of 2018 and I still love this car.  No failures, no issues , no complaints.  Oh, and it still looks just as good and even better than many newer cars in the parking lot at work.   This is a lot of car for a great price.  Such a shame Chrysler, (and now other brands) are abandoning cars for SUV's and Trucks.

chrysler,200,2016,Ernie, 10/30/2016,An accurate review from an OWNER,4,"my credit is not good and it was hard finding a used car that was in great shape. After 5 hrs I was ready to give up. Then they bring out this 2016 black chrysler 200 with 10k miles. I drove it and LOVED the experience. I was approved and because they used the same bank as the one I financed my ford in, I was able to get it with NOTHING down. I've had it for 3 months now and I have to say, I LOVE this car. FIRST the drive... I sometimes think my car is off when I'm waiting at a light because it's very quiet but it roars if you mash the gas peddle. It's such a smooth drive and the seats are comfortable. Sometimes my wife drives it and I end up falling asleep. The gas mileage is okay. I just tried ethanol e85 gas after I found out it can take it. Needless to say the milage is much better and the gas is cheaper! Inside the car is great too. Volume and station control are behind the wheel. USB ports, cup holder that slides and reveals a hidden compartment aka STASH SPOT, LOL. Love the touchscreen and my xm/sirus radio. Climate control is amazing as well. Other than the gas which now is better with e85, I can't think of anything that I DON'T like about the car. Beautiful headlights and a beautiful body, I get compliments about my car. I read some reviews and laughed. A guy said he was 5'10 and heavy and it was hard for him to get in and out the car? I'm 5'11 240 lbs and I have no problem. Maybe is seat was to high, and you can change the elevation of the driver seat..some ppl don't care to look at these details and judge it. YOU have to own a car, not rent it, to get a review that is worth reading. I mean, like others have said,I see this car everywhere. if it was a lemon or a bad car,we wouldn't be seeing them a lot.

chrysler,200,2016,scott ross, 04/20/2016,My Wonder Chrysler 2016 200C,4,"I rented this car because mine was in the shop and loved the feel of the car and the interior was outstanding. I found out that my car was going to be at the dealership for a long time due to a part delay. I rented this 200 for 1 month and my wife fell in love with it. Long story short...my car was recalled and I bought a 200 with the works and it was the best decision I've made in a long time. If you're looking for a luxury look that causes stares to identify what type of car you're driving this is the one for you! Rich look for a reasonable price. Only down side I've had was that navigation is not standard feature for 200c model. I have the 8.4 Uconnect with the Alpine 9 speaker system but would have to pay $695 additionally for just navigation. Not pleased to say the least and at this point will not incur the additional cost for what should be a standard option in such a nice car. Overall rating 9.

It handles like a dream and all the creature comforts exceeded my expectations. The cabin is designed with all the controls within reach and the comfort is better than I expected.

chrysler,200,2016,Sharon O., 03/26/2017,tricky transmission,5,"I had the Chrysler 200S for only a few days. I had to make a sudden stop .Then the car went into Park, & I couldn't get it into drive for several minutes. I finally was able to drive the car home. When I went into the car the following day, it was again stuck in Park. It had to be towed to the dealer. They gave it back to me later that afternoon. but three days later, the problem occurred again, & again it had to be towed back to the dealer where it has been for almost two weeks. I am very discouraged.  Now, October, 2018 my""tricky transmission"" is working just fine. The car rides smoothly as well. 😊

chrysler,200,2016,Zorn C., 01/06/2018,King of it's class (mid-size),5,"Had car since March 2017 .. Got it with just 11K miles.  .. Have taken it from Charlotte, NC, to Michigan and back ... Milwaukee, and back ... And just completed a trip to Cincinnati.

.. These ('17s) are available with wonderful rebates, now ... Get the V6.  Get the V6, get the V6!  Not because there's anything wrong with the 2.4 liter  -> It's an awesome motor .. But they {in some cars} didn't match the 9-speed automatic transmission, to the motor super well ...
Also since mid-model year 2016 can get the middle-grade car, the Limited, with the V6 motor.

Mine's a C  - Top of the 200 sedan food chain ... It is absolutely AWESOME!  All wheel drive package.  300 horsepower (It isn't said, anywhere, but the AWD has a smidgen more power than any non-AWD 200  - Due to it having a different exhaust). ... Love the dash, in this .. How you can sift through all the different things, in the car, with the button on your steering wheel ... Easy to check on all systems ... Mine is jet-black, black leather inside .. Has granite grey rims; 19 inch ..  The dial transmission works, just great!  Some 'expert' car review places have gone on that ""Geez it has too many speeds .. Who wants to shift, nine times?"" ... Well you DON'T shift, nine times .. in regular driving.  Speeds 8 and 9 are highway cruising gears ... and are why with my V6 I got an incredible 31 & 1/2 mpg, on my trip to Ohio.

My car also has the manual shift mode with steering-mounted levers, for if I want to really fly, off of a light.  8.5 inch touch screen is the best, I've ever seen ... Better than my friend's, in his Camry (He even says this .. lol) ... I do miss a CD player.  But I'm getting all my albums on a couple USBs, to stick in and pull up and play.  One has about 40, so far.

As to the flap about the rear roof line [That Sergio, head of Fiat was waayyy to sensitive about, when he gave an interview ... He was not recognizing that Consumer Reports just doesn't like Chryslers, and has been biased, against Chrysler, for a long time]  [I mean kids getting in and out of the back, is no problem ... And really how many people who drive these have (other) adults, getting in and out of the back, all week?  C.R. took one item and hammered the whole car, because of it.  And a lot of people are quickly influenced, by Consumer Reports.  Thankfully, I wasn't]

So, this car is derived from an Alpha Romeo ... I think it's cool I'm driving something with some Italian blood.  
Summing up: I love this car ... Excellent power, takes the curves with aplomb ..  Seats could be slightly more comfortable, but they're ok. ... 100K mile powertrain warranty. .. And awesome tech  :) ... - Zorn
Update:  Oddly enough, Edmunds sent me an email, wanting me to update my review ... So I am.  - Sold her!  Wanted to put some money away ... and drive something slightly less glamorous. .. But I'm sure who's got her, is really enjoying her  😁

chrysler,200,2016,Henry Spindler,MD,Wonderful car,5,"I looked for a mid sized car that was good looking in and out, had a strong engine, and most of all had all of the latest safety features. The 200 was it. In 2015 only Subaru had all the safety features in this price range but was no where near as nice a car. Once you have driven a car with brake assist, lane departure ,backup warnings, adaptive cruise control,etc, you'll never feel as safe driving another. Beyond safety ,this car has a stunning interior. The trunk is hugh, but the back seat head room is tight like every car with fastback styling. Comfort and handling are excellent. it has every convenience you can think of ,heated steering wheel heated and cooled seats, remote start,lock etc either from the remote or the Internet....I can't remember them all. This car is a true bargin and a winner at any price.
1/4/17 update....I love this car so much, I bought another for my granddaughter. It is newer than mine, and the 9 speed trans now shifts very smoothly .  It is a tragedy that they stopped building this car to make more profitable trucks.

chrysler,200,2016,Shawn, 07/18/2017,Horrible 9-speed unreliable transmission,1,"When going from reverse to drive or even from Park to drive the transmission will go into drive at first up to about 5 miles an hour and then starts slipping for about 20 to 30 seconds with the engine revving and then finally goes back into drive with a big thump jerking you back into the seat and is sometimes kind of scary the worst part about it is it's been to the dealership three times and they say they can't duplicate the problem and I told them it was intermittent that it didn't happen all the time I even talked to the service manager after the third time of taking it in and he even told me that there was nothing they could do unless it showed a code that was bad or duplicate the problem and while telling me this he acted like I was bugging him so now I'm stuck with this car but I'm paying a lot of money for a car I'm scared to drive....SO NO I DON'T RECOMMEND ANYONE TO BY THIS TYPE OF CAR AT ALL

chrysler,200,2016,Mike F, 02/06/2017,200s 6 cyl loaded. I Love This Car!,5,"This is a great car. I have 23,000 miles on a 2016 model. Plenty of power. Interior with leather looks great. No mechanical problems at all. The only time I notice the CVT transmission are when starting cold and just the first shifts from park. Performance on the road is excellent. You can accelerate out of any situation and it sounds great doing so. I would have gotten the all wheel drive for the added performance and because the car is worth the investment. 
Ok It's now 2019 and I have 43,000 miles on it and still love the car. No problems so far. I put a great set of performance tires on it and it really helps stick to the road. When you really get on it the car stays straight ahead. Fingers crossed it stays this way. Will drive till 60,000. Then a Model 3 electric.

I bought it brand new with a couple warranties thrown in.    On the highway,  (with the V6)  this car flies!!! Very fast.  Could be faster if it wasn't for the horrible transmission.   If im on the expressway doing about 70, and i want to accelerate and pass someone, it'll think about it for about a second and half and then take off.   Bad, especially when a truck is coming up behind you in the lane you want to merge into...  too bad because it's a fantastic engine.   HORRIBLE transmission.   Great interior build quality and materials (Door closes with a solid thunk).

chrysler,200,2016,Dalia, 12/09/2017,Chrysler 200 is nice but it is a safety concern.,3,"I bought my car brand new from a well known dealership. It was the floor model limited edition. After 9 months of having the vehicle I started having electrical problems to the point it left me stranded on the side of the road. It was under warranty so I had that replaced. Then a few months later I started having transmission problems. Needless to say I am done with my Chrysler 200. I loved the car until it started having too many problems. I just cant do it anymore. I have a kid and thank God that both times that I was left on the side of the road he was not with me. It is now a safety concern of mine.

chrysler,200,2016,Weaver, 05/05/2016,"Well, you get what you pay for.",2,"I like the look of the new 200 which is what got me there. I wasn't looking for an expensive car, need met. The car drives ""OK"", handles, brakes, and features the same. The big problems with this thing is the computer/transmission relationship. IT SUCKS!!!!!  This car doesn't know which gear it wants to be in and at it's worse will just stop for a few seconds (when you need acceleration most) to think about it. Three times I've nearly been in an accident as a result of pulling out hoping for a quick acceleration only to find out that this car would rather think about it. To that I have found a solution should you find yourself in a similar situation (until you can buy yourself out of this dysfunctional relationship). I've been driving in ""L"" or low gear and while my gas milage has suffered a little, the power and acceleration are there when I need it, particularly in stop and go traffic or around town.  (On the open highway, ""D"" works fine.) In low, the computer takes over far before ""red line"" so no need to worry about blowing ANYTHING and it shifts a if it had a ""sport mode"", which it doesn't. SOOOO, now I just hate the car rather than loathing it. Beyond that, given that it's rated the worst car two years running the depreciation is horrific. I hope this helps.

chrysler,200,2016,Dissatisfied, 06/26/2018,Bad decision,1,"I purchased this vehicle (used) in Arizona in October of 2016.  Since that time, I've had issues with the car shutting sown because it's low on oil.  this is bi-weekly.  the car drinks oil like it is a dessert. I put at least a quart to 2 quarts of oil in the vehicle every 2-3 weeks.  It's not leaking out so where is it going.  It has been to the dealer at least 7 times.  It will shut down on you in the middle of traffic if the oil is low within the 2-3 week period (very dangerous, especially when you're on the freeway0.  the dealer says it does that to protect the engine.  well how about finding out why it consumes so much oil..and where is it going.  In addition, I ALWAYS have a check engine light.  It's intermittent and of course the dealer can't get a reading if it's not on.  the light popped on 2 weeks ago, I took it to auto zone for them to get a reading (because it was closer).  It said it was the catalytic converter.  I took it to the dealer the next day, it read the same thing.  I returned a week later to have it repaired (mind you, it was determined that it was still under warranty)..Wouldn't you know, it didn't read catalytic converter, it read a misfire so they didn't replace the catalytic converter. How can both places have the same reading and it turns into something else.  the acceleration is poor.  It slows down when it like and has to catch up to go up a hill.  I have not had this car a year yet and have spent most of my time with it in and out of the shop. I DO NOT recommend this vehicle because it is not reliable and it's costly.  I may as well have an oil pump in my back yard.   #verydissatisfied"

Took to dealer they submitted it to Chrysler who denied the claim and said it wasn't under warranty. I called customer care who said there was nothing they could do about it.

chrysler,200,2016,Anthony, 02/25/2017,Great Value on a Great Car!,5,"Although I have owned my 2016 Chrysler 200S V6 AWD for 2 weeks and have a little under 400 miles on the odometer I can say with certainty that I absolutely love this car. Due to my job and being in the North East I needed an AWD vehicle and this Chrysler more than fits the bill. It has a nice and aggressive exterior design and the interior is absolutely fantastic.  The front seats are comfortable and supportive while the controls are within easy reach. I purchased mine fully load with every option available. Heated and ventilated leather front seats, heated steering wheel, blind spot detection, navigation, panoramic moon roof, alloy wheels, rear seat vents and auto start. I traded my Honda Accord Sport for my 2016 Chrysler 200S and have been smiling ear to ear since. Previous to the Honda Accord Sport I owned a Mitsubishi Lance Ralliart that had a turbo charged 2.4 liter 4 cylinder engine yet my Chrysler 200S performs almost as well. Bare in mind that the Ralliart was a sports car and the Chrysler is a family sedan yet the 295 horsepower V6 has plenty of power when needed and the Sport mode will push you back into your seat if you get hard on the gas. 0-60 in about 5.8 seconds is plenty quick for me especially when my Ralliart went 0-60 in 5.5 seconds. Its basically an AWD family sedan muscle car that has a sweet sounding exhaust.   I will say that this car is by no means perfect. The 9 speed automatic transmission can be a bit clunky at times, the stock tires are terrible and rear seat headroom is an issue if you have passengers over 6 feet tall riding in the back. I'm not in love with the braking either as the car is heavy but it my opinion the braking should be more responsive. Perhaps I just need to get used to it. However, when you take over $10,000 in incentives into consideration and can buy a car like this for under $30K it's an absolute no brainer. 3 years 36,000 miles bumper to bumper warranty and 5 years 60,000 miles on the powertrain. If you're like me and are looking for an AWD vehicle that has sharp looks, plenty of cargo room, have little ones and want a vehicle that can get you from 0-60 in less than 6 seconds look no further than the Chrysler 200S AWD V6. It's being discontinued so get one while you can before it's too late.
"
chrysler,200,2016,DK67, 02/06/2018,Owned for nearly 4 Years Now,5,"I have not had it into the shop for anything except oil changes. Yes, the transmission occasionally (rarely) jerks in low gears 1st or 2nd, but not a big deal. It rides great on highway. I have the 4 cylinder, so it's not super quick, but it gets up to speeds fine and doesn't feel bogged down except for maybe when you stop and start a lot in city with AC running. I would have gotten the 3.6L if it was my only car, but it was a second car I bought to use as a daily driver. The 2.4L is fine for me. The looks, features and interior are good for the price. I don't know why people have trouble getting in, I'm 6'2"" and I don't struggle at all. The only interior rattle I've had is from the sunglasses holder, which I fixed with a piece of stick on vinyl to eliminate the plastic on plastic rubbing that was occurring. If you want to compare it to a luxury sedan, yeah, it's going to lose. It's also half the price and still performs great for a daily car. I purchased mine with serious rebates, so I paid only about 2/3 of sticker price, so I'm very happy with it. I have leather, heated seats, cruise, rear camera, blue tooth, touchscreen, usb, power seats an much more for under $20K.  I think Chrysler is making a mistake discontinuing these. My wife drives a loaded Chrysler Town & Country that has had several issues, but the 200 has been problem free. I have no plans on getting rid of it as it looks and rides like new.

Update 2-7-2019 - Still haven't had one problem and has never been into the shop for repairs. Changed oil, cabin air filter and rotated tires in December 2018. I only put about 3500 miles per year on it, but it's still nearly 4 years old, so I would've had some sort of problem by now if it wasn't a decent car. I drive it mostly in the winter and no problem when we went sub-zero last week. Still looks like new too.

PS: I have the 5 inch touchscreen multimedia system, and while it doesn't look very impressive, the functions and Bluetooth performance is excellent. I love the phone options that allow you to dial on screen, see your contact lists, recent calls and even respond to text messages with pre-set voice commands. My wife's 2013 T&C with the larger NAV system doesn't have these options...I don't know if they upgraded the system in 2015. It is super simple to pair your phone and use the system...no instruction manual necessary.  All the other features are laid out nicely and easy to operate as well, just push the button for the feature (Radio, Media, Phone, Climate, etc...) and the controls for that option are displayed on the touchscreen. Most controls have a duplicate button or knob to control from the console as well.

Update 8/11/2020: I finally had to take it to the shop. The passenger side heater was blowing cold air. They replaced a sensor that wasn't reading the correct temperature. It was under extended warranty, so it cost me $100. I also had to replace the battery, which showed no signs of dying...it just did one morning. Car still looks and rides like brand new. The 'jerky' shifting is almost non-existent anymore...at least I don't notice it. I still insist that Chrysler made a big mistake getting rid of these.

Great Price- bought used, 2016 model purchased 2017 with 9800 miles & paid $16,000 with dealer provided finance co.                2. Mechanical- still under warranty when purchased (1 warranty service replaced entire rack & pinion at 30,000 miles after i went off road,  shhh). Motor, transmission,  brakes,  a/c, starter,  alternator,  etc. performing great holding up strong now at 49,000 miles. using as company vehicle                     3. Performance- not a big fan of 4 cylinders, but surpassed expectations,  as expected has slow acceleration but have tracked highway mileage at over 49 MPG at 1800 RPM flat highway. Cold air.  Brakes average,  but i have stomped them hard several times and still has firm pedal but does not stop quick like truck brakes. Fully expect motor and transmission to hold out well until trade in at 125,000 miles. No complaints about 9 speed transmission shifts smooth for me.  starts easy,  idles and runs smooth.  Driven hard in Texas climate from hill country to desert terrain to Saltwater Gulf at 40,000 miles i have driven in less than 18 months.  Runs strong and durable.    4. Comfort/ features- interior is loaded as are most 4 cylinders to hide economy of the power train. Bluetooth,  stereo,  automated controls,  etc best i have had but newest vehicle i ever owned as i assume power ports,  etc.  are now standard equipment as phone,  computer,  audio,  video technologies merge.  Looks expensive based on dash (back uo camera, programmable features,  monitors for MPG,  air pressure,  temperatures,  etc. ).            Good driving experience for balance of economy cost for purchase  price,  maintenance costs (american made parts & labor),  operation (1 gallon of gas over 40 miles highway), & enough power for climbing hills,  entering freeway speeds, and carrying people and cargi load capacity. The back seat headroom never an issue for me as front extra roomy and just put kids or shorter passengers in back (mom slept in back on road trips). If you want fancy or  show not your vehicle but looks stylish inside and out for avg.  surburban family.  I would buy again.

chrysler,200,2016,Emma Hanson, 07/21/2017,lemon,1,"Bought the car brand new first month had to take it back when in cruse control going up a small sill will slow down about 7 miles form set control then coming down it will speed up over 12 miles and I say over cause I had to disengage the control to slow down, took it to the dealership and they told me it is the nature  of the model. Three months later I took it in for problems with front passenger carpet they semi fixed it, a month later took it back in for same reason they replaced it, about six months later took it in for a nose on the nob shifter every time I stepped on the beak and only with the motor running if you stepped on the break and put it on drive it wouldn't happen, the fixed that, it was a censer in the shifter.  Couple of moths later doing about 75mph down a busy Hwy I have a truck on my back when to accelerate to pass and get out of this trucks way, all my gages when haywire and car when from 75 to 45 check engine light came on and heat gage showed it was hot so I pulled over gave it a few minutes though well I'll limp to the nearest exit stepped on gas and guess what went back to 75 like nothing had just happened, however the check engine light stayed on so took it back in following morning after all this was on a Sunday, they checked it out said it was a censer in the transmission, fixed that got it back a week later, the day I got it back went home at home go put it in reverse there it set transmission would not engage, took it back next day they had the car for another week they couldn't fine nothing wrong cense then it shifts funny, and now just took it in for the carpet issue AGAIN. I'm at the point that I don't know what to do any more I just know I don't want this car. I love the car the design of the car the looks but not all the problems I've been having

I had the oil changed and it continue to do the same things. Some morning the car will not Start. You have to hit the button five or six times before it will start. They gas peddle has a popping sound to it. The check engine light came on Friday. I took it to auto zone and had it put on the machine, then took it to the dealer ship. They put it on the machine before it went to the back. At auto zone and at the service desk the both had five different codes for what was going on with it.

chrysler,200,2016,Richard, 12/12/2016,Chrysler 200 not good if you want to drive,3,"This is a great  car if you like having a car that will at random not want to start because it thinks something is wrong with the brakes. It is also a good find if you like taking the car to the dealer 4 times in 4 months and them having the car for 3 weeks of the 4 months you had it.

After the 4 months of hell the car hasn't  had anymore issues. They just need to get that extra quality check in so the car is good day 1 and not waiting for day 120.

chrysler,200,2016,Lewis, 08/29/2016,"No. No, no, no.",2,"I rented this machine for a week while visiting wine country (Napa/Sonoma) and was so glad to be rid of it. (Note: be careful when renting a car that says something like ""Toyota Camry or similar"" - the ""or similar"" may be a Chrysler 200) The driver's seat took two days to put into a quasi-comfortable position.  The grip to enable the driver to close the door was virtually unreachable, requiring you to nearly get out of the car to reach it. Worse, there seemed to be no way to turn off the radio, only mute it. This became problematic when I'd paired my phone to the entertainment system - the radio had to be on for me to hear my phone's GPS directions, but they were drowned out by whatever station the radio was on. And the radio (as well as the AC) came on as soon as I started the car, no matter how I tried to defeat it. The most incredible thing about this rolling disaster film was the transmission. It was beyond automatic; it was undecided. The car seemed to vacillate as to which gear it most preferred when going up a hill, shifting from low to another gear to another and back to low in a sort of random, capricious style similar to when our then-teenage daughters chose which lipstick to wear. Worst of all, the transmission is controlled by a knob on the center console. A knob! And right next to the transmission knob is another knob that controls the fan speed. It was quite easy to turn the fan up or down and instead turn the transmission knob. I'm confident the designer of the car is named ""Sparky.""

chrysler,200,2016,FDR, 11/29/2016,Not for Us...even with the Incentive,3,"What drew us in was the massive discount on this car--nearly $10,000. But the car's sluggish responsiveness and hesitant acceleration was a deal breaker. A 6 cylinder should handle better. Also problematic was the lack of rear seat room--only two adults fit comfortably--and hitting my head getting in and out. The car also did not have enough hauling capacity for our needs...we wanted to pit a trailer hitch on the car but it would void the warranty. No deal for us here.

chrysler,200,2016,Bonnie , 01/27/2020,Interior flaws,3,"My car has black cloth interior which is impossible to keep clean. It gets white stains(like water stains) apparently from just body moisture. I finally bought seat covers to hide it. It won't vacuum out. 
Steam cleaning might work but who has to constantly steam clean their car's interior?
It's definitely not the right material for use in a car! Also the color on the temperature arrows is rubbing off. The location of the headlight settings is to the lower left of the steering wheel where you knee hits it when getting in or out of the car. The transmission control is circular as is the fan control right above it which can be confusing. Your hand hits the emergency flasher button while adjusting other settings on the dash display.  You are forced to take your eyes off the road to make adjustments on the dash display. 
The car looks and drives nicely but these other problems should have been detected when the car was designed and tested.

I love the Uconnect system it is the best in the business. The gas mileage has been great I get up to 40 MPG on the highway and usually around 28 MPG with mixed driving. My only warning is that the backseat headroom is not too great and I think its even worse with the panoramic sunroof option. I love this car so much!

Now I have 16500 miles on the odometer. Only oil changes and tire rotations. This car versus my old Chevy cruze has been rock solid reliable. The 9 speed computerized automatic transmission takes some getting use to,  I don't feel it shift at all neither do my passengers. The back seat is spacious rather the head room is kinda tight. Love the European styling too. Sadly they are discontinued,  however I bought new so I'm upside down. I suggest buying them used much better deals and more affordable. The interior is top notch too, I average 26 mpg combined, in Wisconsin with hills and traffic as well as a lot of cold starts and morning too. Five star crashtests across the board sold me on it

chrysler,200,2017,clif, 12/06/2016,drive this car,5,"Don't read and believe some of the biased reviews on this car. Most of those reviews are kind of silly and are not going to effect how you like or dislike the car. The only fault I can see with the car is if your over 6 feet tall the back seat will be a little tight getting in and out but since everybody in my family is under that height no complaint from me. In fact I love the roof line it make's the car look very nice. Gas milage has been outstanding getting 40mpg on the highway and 28mpg in town. Drive this car and make up your own mind and don't let some guy sitting in an office somewhere make it for you. I've had the car long enough now to confirm my positive review from day one. Have had no problems but needed a new battery under warranty no charge to me, service was fast and friendly. Some of the negative reviews on this car make me laugh, things like not liking the color of the lights in the dash, no headroom in the back. seats uncomfortable, rough ride, road noise and on and on. Are they serious. I drove a lot of cars before I found this one and in my opinion it's right up there with the best of them. Drive this car up the freeway and when the transmission shifts into ninth gear watch the RPMs drop 400 and the milage jump up to around 40mpg, wow. The only other car in my opinion that was it's equal was the Buick Verano. I'm biased though I will not buy a foreign made car with a foreign name on it. People told me I could buy a Toyota they're made in the U.S, sure but most of the money goes to Japan and most of the parts are shipped into the country. Buy American with an American name on the car.

chrysler,200,2017,Lori E., 05/15/2017,Pleasantly Surprised,5,"I recently bought a 2017 Chrysler 200 after my Jeep Wrangler took a dive after only 92K miles. To be honest I was going to buy the Mazda6, but after driving that I was like ""no way""(it was too outdated and small). The salesman at the dealership showed me the Chrysler, and after a 3 minute argument about my not wanting one I finally said I would test drive it just to get him off my back. However, after sitting in for a minute or two and realizing how comfortable it was, and how I didn't feel cramped in it like I did the Mazda, and how great it handled on the highway, I was hooked.  I have a 14 year old who had his heart set on getting the Jeep when he was old enough to drive, but came in after hubby took him for a ride in the 200 and said ""I like it WAY better than the Jeep!"", so I imagine that he is going to steal this car from me when he turns 16. I'm really very happy with this ride. It's comfy, handles awesome on the road, and has just enough bells and whistles to satisfy my inner diva without breaking the bank.

Wow, a nice vehicle with an interior that looks and feels much more like a premium import than a domestic standard-bearer. Chrysler went way out on a limb to offer a truly world-class mid-size sedan.

chrysler,200,2017,Zorn Casteel, 12/13/2017,200C V6 AWD - King of the Mid-Size Segment,5,"(with possible exception to the 4-door Accord V6) ..... Have had car since March this year .. Got it with just 12K miles.  .. Have taken it from Charlotte, NC, to Michigan and back ... Milwaukee, and back ... And just completed a round trip to Cincinnati.

.. These (2016s and '17s) are available with wonderful rebates, now ... Get the V6.  Get the V6, get the V6!  Not because there's anything wrong with the 2.4 liter  -> It's an awesome motor .. But they (on some 200s) didn't build the 9-speed automatic transmission, to the motor well ... Also since mid-model year 2016 can get the middle grade car, the Limited, with the V6 motor.

Mine's a C  - top of the 200 sedan food chain ... It is absolutely AWESOME!  All wheel drive package.  300 horsepower (It isn't said, anywhere, but the AWD has a smidgen more power, than the non .. Has different exhaust.) ... Love the dash, in this .. How you can sift through all the different things, in the car, with the button on your steering wheel ... Mine is jet-black, black leather inside had granite grey rims; 19 inch ..  The dial transmission works, just great!  Some 'expert' car review places have gone on that ""Geez it has too many speeds .. Who wants to shift, nine times?"" ... Well you DON'T shift, nine times ..  in regular driving.  Speeds 8 and 9 are highway cruising gears ... and are why with my V6 I got an incredible 31 & 1/2 mpg, on my trip to Ohio.

My car also has the manual shift mode with steering-mounted levers, for if I want to really fly, off of a light.  8.4 inch touch screen is rhe best, I've ever seen ... Better than my friend's, in his Camry (He even says this .. lol) ... I do miss a CD player. ... But I'm getting my albums on a couple USBs, to stick in and pull up and play.  One has about 40, so far.

As to the flap about the rear roof line [That Sergio, head of Fiat was waayyy too sensitive about, in that interview he gave ... He was not recognizing that Consumer Reports just doesn't like Chryslers, and has been biased against Chrysler, for a long time]  [I mean kids getting in and out of the back is no problem ... And really how many people who drive these have (other) adults, getting in and out of the back, all week?  C.R. took one item and hammered the whole car, because of it.  And a lot of people are quickly influenced by Consumer Reports.  Thankfully, I wasn't]

So, this car is derived from an Alpha Romeo ... It's cool I'm driving something with some Italian blood.  
Summing up: Car is terrific ... Wonderful power, takes the curves with aplomb ..  Seats could be slightly more comfortable, but they're ok. ... 100K mile powertrain warranty. .. Awesome tech  :) ... ... ... Update - Chrysler made, in the marketing of this car (In part leading to it's demise. - FCA, you want me to sit in on your next new car marketing meeting?  Send me a note  -> You need me) ~ 
They did not promote this car {200C and 200S V6} near enough.  In their TV and radio advertising they did not spell out differentiation between the lower LX and Limited models, and my car. .. Most people thought it was just 'the Chrysler 200' ... While they would have had a lot more buyers for the high end ones ... if they advertised them.  .. They are jam-packed with features found in Audis and BMWs, which cost thousands and thousands more.  2. They SHOULD NOT HAVE called it the 200.  The last 200 car was starting to have some really bad things said about it (yes, some unfair) .. But the point is if they would have dropped the name, associated with a struggling, marginal vehicle - And came up with a brand new name, and presented the car it would be a different ballgame.  Sergio is an idiot, and I'm glad he's leaving - - Because he really believes that if Consumer Reports says you made a crappy car, you made a crappy car. ... Point is put this car out with a new name; it's a NEW CAR ... People wouldn't mentally have
 to get the bad taste out of their mouths, from the last model - to step in the car, objectively, and take it on test-drive.  
Yes also making sure the 9-speed trans was better synced to the 2.4 liter motor, would've been a good move .. But if they do those two things, they didn't - sales would have been huge, and the bad word of Consumer Reports' review wouldn't have had the effect on the perception of the car, it did. .. They may not even have written it.  (And I keep referring to it because go look at sales, of the 2015-2016 200  - They were pretty good; and when that hit they dropped off the cliff .. literally overnight)
... The car is NOT one of the worst investments they ever made .. Not itself ... It became a costly mistake, because of the way they mismanaged it's launch, and initial promotion of the different models.  Lots of stupid things ... Like they should never have let any 200Cs be made with the 4 cylinder.  Keep it at the lofty perch, at top car of the line [It has the V6.  This is a 300 horsepower car .. Period.] ... They confused everything. .. I still love mine  :)

chrysler,200,2017,Rasean Robinson, 05/31/2017,It’s okay.,3,"I got about $6500 in rebates to trade in my old 2015 Fiat 500. This car is definely a major upgrade (interior wise). I loved the car so far transmission shifts smooth only in certain gears. Going up hills and inclines the transmission is the worst! Shifts hard and the “dog clutch gears” slam making the car jerk hard as if someone rear ended you. Dealer gives a hard time with any complaints about the transmission.  I LOVE MY white leather seats, although they get dirty fast LOOKS GREAT. I get a lot of compliments with my car. The first 2,000 miles I thought i'd check the oil, it was extremely low. I know it's breaking in but now at 54,000 it burns a quart about every 1200 miles, they say it’s normal for this engine. The engine block looks as if there’s a little oil seeping out it dealer says it’s fine. It’s only going to get worse.  Overall, the car is very poorly built. I don’t think it’ll even make 100,000 miles. Interior is a beauty but mechanically and suspension is crap!!!

I’m looking to maybe buy one more since they are discontinued so I have one to replace this one in another 100k or so. Adaptive cruse is awesome, v6 is perfect balance of power and mileage, 9 speed has been flawless, interior and electronics is the best, only improvement would be a USB ports in back seat area. Awd is ok in snow, a little more spin is allowed before it kicks in than I’d like but it works great after it locks in . Brakes are good and pads last! I drive hard! Stock tires are crap (of course). The only repairs I’ve made is a new thermostat housing and gasket due to leak and new battery, factory one was crap (of course...lol). Do yourself a favor and Give this car a drive if you are in the market, don’t waste time on the I 4, v6 is a whole different animal- only way to go!

I operated the car throughout the entire state of South Carolina working for state government, putting on a little over 39,000 miles.  I cruised the highways from Myrtle Beach, Columbia, and to Greenville.  The car was great!  It was comfortable, accelerated well, and was quiet inside.  I wished I could have bought the car back at the end of my employment, but that did not happen.  The car was a good experience.  My wife thought the passenger side seats were hard, but I did not share in that complaint.  I am 6 feet, 1 inch and fit well behind the steering wheel.  The trunk was a good size, and the rear seats could be folded down to accommodate the equipment of any trainee that I was mentoring.  Of all things from my last state employment, I do miss that 2017 Chrysler 200 Touring being parked in my driveway.

chrysler,300m,2000,duster7, 01/22/2014,14 years and still going strong,4,"I bought my 2000 300M brand new (ordered from the factory) and have had nothing but a great experience with it.

The car was not as fast as my twin-turbo Stealth but very few cars could match that performance.
But it has room.
I am tall and even with the driver's seat in my driving position, I can sit comfortably in the back seat without my legs touching the driver's seat.

The ride is very comfortable without being out-of-touch.

The reliability has been nothing short of amazing.
Other than normal wear parts (tires, break pads, bushings, wiper blades, air filters, etc) the car has not needed any significant work.
Nearly 200,000 miles!"

I have to say I did keep up with the oil changes, most of my driving was highway driving for about 100 per day. The 300M has served me well. The problems I have had with the car was that all 4 of the automatic door locks needed to be replaced, warranty handled the cost of 2 and I footed the cost for the other 2. I even tried to get them to replace the last 2 before the door locks failed and the warranty ran out but no luck. Also the air-conditioner required about 1,000 dollars of work to get fix after 7 years. If those items didn't go wrong I may have gotten another. Surprise, but I'm driving a Prius now.    "

With factory chrome wheels and slightly fatter tires on the 17"" wheels, it looks very contemporary.  Most newer cars still retain the look the 330M pioneered in 1999.  No significant problems - Except for tires, all original equipment. (Almost all highway driving).  I'd buy it again."

Still had original EVERYTHING: shocks, struts, battery, brakes. Original owner did nothing but put gas in it(probably didn't even change the oil). I changed all those items and put new tires on it, then racked up 65k more over the next 2 years. It started everyday, got me wherever I wanted to go in comfort and style. Just had to change the oil every 3k. It was the best car I've ever had and it was only $7k (low price because of the high miles). I wish I could buy a brand new one, but they've been replaced with the new 300 (fewer features, higher prices)."

Big mistake.  I was suckered into believing in American made and falling for the cool exterior design...what was underneath was pure junk.  I can't tell you the amount of money, worry, disappointment, and absolute frustration this vehicle has brought me.  I remember bringing it home thinking I would baby it and have it for years...imagining it could be considered a classic some day...what a naive notion that was.  It's a Chrysler stupid!!!!  USA Auto Execs dismissed Dr. Deming who wanted to teach them about Total Quality Systems.  So he went to Japan where they listened."

Condenser ($700), power steering lines ($200) and front end parts needed replaced. I replaced many parts under the front end and still couldn't get rid of the clunking noise.

Had to replace complete steering box and sway bar in July of 2004.  Estimated bill from dealer was $2100 but they made goodwill adjustment and reduced it to $300.  In June of this year the air conditioner started blowing warm air.  Dealer checked for leaks and recharged for $246.  Now in Sept it is blowing warm air again and they tell me the Evaporator needs replaced at $1050 and the car now has 28.861 miles.  I has Chrylser for a adjustment and they refused.  Pretty good realibility from Chrysler for a car having 28,861  mile! Had previous Chryslers and never had to replace major components like  these. Won't buy another Chrysler."

Bought it in 2008 with 77K miles on it.
Since then I've had to replace the power door lock on the driver's side, the front suspension control arms, turn signal flasher and the oil pressure switch.
The a/c also doesn't blow cold because there's a leak in the a/c system (the condenser, compressor, or evaporator).
Not sure if I want to spend the money to fix the a/c.
Also the interior instrument panel lights were flashing, so I replaced the headlight/dimmer switch assembly with a used on purchased from eBay (that fixed the problem).

I love my car but in the first year I put over 4000 into repair from Front end popping (which came back after replacing knuckles) constant creaking sound in my trunk area. Speakers blew a month after having the thing. Constant electrical problems. My dash flickers and my heated seats dont work. Ive gotten all new tires and they still leak! NEW rims and they still leak!

Initially was leery about car, given Chrysler's reputation for poor product quality, but so far have been pleasantly pleased. Highway acceleration is good.  Sound system is nice, except two speakers are blown, and I can't stand the idea of paying for something that my 10-year-old son calls ""cosmetic.""  Only major mechanical problem has been a transmission sensor that put car into ""limp in"" mode.  Once diagnostic code was cleared, car ran fine.  I think my 300M must have been lovingly maintained by a doctor or something, because it's been--knock on wood-- relatively problem-free.  Insurance costing more than maintenance."

There have been some problems with the dashboard blinking, radiator, drivers window, headlamps foggy, dashboard cracked, rims leak  badly - and now some minor electrical and transmission problems.

lamp that goes nuts in bright sunlight, 
a crunching noise in the front end but

the Goodyear tires supplied from the

drive, handles as good as my Corvette. 
With the 3.5, 250 hp engine and auto 
stick couldn't be more fun to drive. I 
have the car for one month so far, so 
good. Now I have the best of both 
worlds."
chrysler,300m,2000,Chrysler 300M, 04/17/2005,Great car to drive and look at!,4,"I have to say this has been a trouble free car.  It has had no major problems. It is one of the few cars I have owned in my 73 years that I like as much now as the day I drove it off the dealers lot.  The new 300 is nice, except for more power in the 300C I would not sell my 300M to get one."
chrysler,300m,2000,wysure, 11/09/2003,Shoulda got the LS,3,"I chose this car over the Lincoln LS.  
I like the looks better and it had more 
power, BUT the quality is poor at 
best.  The chrome coating is coming off 
all of the lettering on the sides, the 
finish is so soft, it scratched just by 
looking at it, the wind and tire noise 
is unacceptable in a $30,000+ car.  
More?  The window creaks and is going 
to give at any moment, the steering 
wheel is deteriorating right in my 
hands and can't be cleaned.  Still 
more?  The strip of weatherproofing 
around the driver door came off 
(speaking of wind noise...).  I could 
go on...but you get the idea.  And just 
look at that 300C coming down the 
pike!!!  UGH!!!"
chrysler,300m,2000,Wesbar, 12/16/2003,DON'T buy this car without a warranty,3,"Overall quality of this car is pathetic 
as I've had one problem after another. 
The rack and pinion had to be replaced 
($800)after developing a dangerous 
amount of slack, the front passenger 
door lock actuator went out ($150), the 
driver's side speaker went out ($150) 
and now the fuel gauge is 
malfunctioning. I just paid the 
(Irving, TX) Chrysler dealership where 
the car was bought for a full tuneup 
($200) at the 66,000 warranty service 
and they can do absolutely nothing 
about the very rough idle the 
car has developed. I can honestly say 
buying this car was a mistake and I 
will have absolutely nothing to do with 
Chrysler products in the future."

love this car and I hope it lasts 
forever. I drive over 45,000 miles a 
year and this is the best vehicle I've 
ever owned. Nothing and I mean NOTHING 
has gone wrong with this car. It still 
looks great and it still turns heads. 
It is also very good (and predictable) 
in snow (northeast US). Fast and 
comfortable, handles great and has all 
the goodies."
chrysler,300m,2000,2nd chrysler, ,so sorry i paid for it,2,"2nd Chrysler product 1st was a 99 intrepid, and I loved it, but had  bushings, brake and alignment issues always,  never had any major work done. Got the 300 after intrepid was wrecked,  and it's been nothing but transmission problems, tire replacements,  and now when I accelerate,  and brake the car vibrates,  not sure what it is,  just had to spend $1032 at pomoco Chrysler in VA  to get seals replaced and a few other things. now less than a month later I will be back for poor steering, and the transmission is jumping when shifting,  and not shifting between gears when accelerating. I will never purchase a Chrysler again, and might sell it. over $3000 in the last 6 months, and more tomorrow."

It has all the options you could 
want,plus with Auto-Stick it's fun to 
drive.  It handles great for a large 
car. The suspension is tight with the

pickup and passing power. I've driven 
it from NY to FL and it's comfortable 
on the long runs."

Very comfortable, comes loaded: power 
seats, heated seats, leather.  Very 
comfortable car, large trunk, good 
power, I like the auto stick.  I go 
through  the mountains every day and 
just leave it in 3rd.  Good power up 
the hills and keeps you at the limit

purchased the veh but after I drove it 
10,000 miles and had to purchase a 
sensor in my transmission. Then at 
75000 miles I noticed slow cranking

over that last 101,000 miles:  Great 
looks (my opinion)and reliability. "
chrysler,300m,2000,antho59263, 11/14/2004,Very poor qaulity. Very displeased.,2,"This car has been a major pain & costly to own.  In the three years we have owned the car each of the power door lock motors went out one at a time costing about $200 each to replace.  I have taken it into the Chrysler dealer every three months since April 2004 for transmission repairs.  Each time the dealer gouged us any where from $200-$500.  Its also needed emmision repairs, speaker replacement, computer repairs."
chrysler,300m,2000,Alan, 04/27/2006,2000 300M,4,I bought this car used almost 3 years ago and have only had to replace the spark plugs and front brake pads.  The car is very reliable.  I recently got 32MPG on a trip.  I love the car's styling and comfort and plenty of power when you need it.
chrysler,300m,2000,markmgolf, 03/27/2003,Never Again Chrysler,4,"Last Chrysler product for me.  Glad it 
was only a lease.  In the first 18000 
miles, had a window motor replace, 
light switch replaced and the window 
trim shrunk and was replaced.  By 28000 
miles, the car had to be towed and the 
battery replaced.  Also, way to much 
road noise.  Enjoyed the ride and style.
Too bad the reliability was poor."
chrysler,300m,2000,Glen-S, 04/04/2003,Has been a great car,4,"In three years, I have yet to have my 
first problem with this car.  I have 
it serviced on the scheduled intervals 
but it has not needed any other 
repairs.  The car is a pleasure to 
drive, especially on the highways.  It 
is very comfortable and contains every 
imaginable convenience.  Chrysler has 
created a real winner in this car."
chrysler,300m,2000,Scottnjoan, 04/23/2003,Mixed feelings,3,"In August, I plan to walk away after 3-
year lease.  The car has been very 
reliable, luxurious and rides like a 
standstill at 80mph  but too big for 
tight parking spots, rather boring to 
drive, and starting to show some age at 
27K mi.  Also, security system starting 
to become sensitive and triggering 
alarm when I park."
chrysler,300m,2000,Grendl, 01/03/2003,Compared to 1966 300,4,"This is a more powerful car than I 
expected, having adjusted to the last 
decade's underperformance. I was raised 
on muscle cars, and have a tendency to 
compare those to everything I drive 
currently. My 1966 Chrysler 300 
convertible was a stylish, luxury barge 
that sailed down the road, albeit fast, 
comfortable, and with every toy 
imaginable. "

chrysler,300m,2000,W J, 06/08/2003,300M,4,"The 300M has both style and comfort 
when compared to the others in its 
class.   Easily much better on the eyes 
that the LeSabre, Bonneville or Crown 
Victoria.   Transmission had problems 
at about 50,000 miles, but via some

play,shimmy or noise & excessive tire 
wear: be aware the Chrysler dealerships 
tolerance for ""alignment"" vs that of 
independent hi-quality front-end 
alignments is considerable. We went 
thru original 4 Michelins 60K tires

chrysler,300m,2000,Len E, 03/30/2008,Solid Performer,4,"Bought new in 1999 and I couldn't be more pleased. I had to replace the door locks and power window motor like others here, but that's it - a total of about $600 in repair over 8 years.  Drives great and I've been impressed on mileage - 29+ in freeway driving with 4 adults and luggage. 22.5 in everyday city driving.  If you're looking for a low cost family car, easy to maintain but fun to drive - this is it.   "
chrysler,300m,2000,rbrowntx, 03/29/2002,Great with flaws,4,"Aside from the front end ""shake"" - we love this car.  We have had to machine the rotors twice (first time they were warped, second time for good measure after new tires and 4-wheel alignment), we bought new tires because the stock tires were falling apart (Good Year LS - th ebead was falling apart, presumably causing the front end shake).  The car drives fine now, though I understand the shake is common in the vehicle.  The car is also a tad bit hard to stop - I think the rotors are undersized for this size vehicle."
chrysler,300m,2000,Doc J, 03/30/2002,"Comfortable, Reliable, Fun Car",5,"My second 300M , both a pleasure to own. The first had a sticky driver's window and one faulty switch in 30K mi.  The second has been trouble free.
The only design fault I can complain about is the high trunk sill that gets scratched by heavy suitcases.  Hardly major!"

I have driven it for a long time.  It has only 110,000 original miles because I had another car for a while but...it still looks great and drives great.  I have maintained it but with the exception of new tires, batteries and routine stuff this car has been great!

chrysler,300m,2001,Jess, 02/16/2016,owned since 2005 and still in love,4,"I've owned my 2001 300m since mid-2005 and I have loved almost every minute of it. The car is super comfortable which is nice as we travel down south a couple times a year from MN. I say almost because I feel the handling on our snow/ice roads was not the best prior to the purchase of my snow tires. Now it's been as good as a FWD vehicle could be. But I also had my first real issue with the car with the drivetrain (or drive shaft, I can't recall) going out. Lucky for me I know a great mechanic with a garage so it didn't cost me a fortune to fix. The worst part was it went out 300 miles from home on I-29 on a blustery (okay, for anyone that's been to SD - WINDY!!) winter day in SD. Fortunately the vehicle still ran so we were warm, even if we couldn't go anywhere. I'm still fortunate with only 130,000 miles on it, but I've been very happy with the vehicle considering the price paid and how reliable it's been for me.

I'm now looking for something larger with my son and family, and have my heart set on a GMC Acadia (I am NOT getting a mini-van!) for the ease of getting to the 3rd row for my dog (not having to fold down seats or jump over a center console). Unfortunately the reviews are very poor so it sparked me to post a positive one for my very reliable, yet 15 year old, Chrysler 300m. I often find people only post negative reviews, and don't take the time to post positive ones. I'll be sad to pass it along to a new family but I know from my experience, it'll take good care of them!

chrysler,300m,2001,Lou's 300M, 11/04/2010,Lou's 300M,4,"I love this car reminds me of some of the old time luxury cars.  Had to replace two front door speakers $180.00 for the pair. At 30,000 all dash board functions went to key off position and would not return $800.00. I now have rust on the tip of the hood. To replace with OEM will cost about $2000.00. Sounds like a lot but keep in mind that this car has 90,000 miles on it and a is 10 years old. That comes to only $200.00 per year. Try to buy a new and equivalent for that money. I am going to do what ever work is needed to this car and will still have a great looking, riding, reliable car for years to come.

The driver's position, comfort and visability is great.Wind noise is at a minimum. My wife loves it. I have a Jaguar that is the finest car I've ever had. It is superb.

chrysler,300m,2001,holly25, 05/18/2013,Amazing car,4,"I finally had to get rid of this car at 162,000 miles due to general mechanical failure. However, I feel like this car's ""death"" was well-deserved and reasonably timed and I couldn't be happier with how it served me over the last 12 years. I never had any major issues at all with the car until 120,000 miles. Drove super well, no complaints.

These days I feel Chrysler has gone to much cheaper quality with some of their sedans (ie Sebring). This 300m is one of the great ones. Quality was wonderful inside and out. In its later years I did experience some condensation in the headlights which god knows annoys the crap out of me, but not a big deal. Most comfortable seats you'll ever sit in. "
chrysler,300m,2001,ddbates, 04/21/2015,I Won't Do That Again,3,"I bought my 2001 300m last summer. By December the transmission went out. When I bought the car it had picture perfect carfax. It was beautiful. I fell in love at first sight. However, the honeymoon did not last long. I had to replace the front struts and a tie rod end. $890. A couple months later the ac condenser went out. Even with repairs I felt the car rode rough compared to my Avalon. Finally the transmission went out. Really? I take care of my vehicles and even if I didn't I did not have enough time to neglect it. This car died at 175--- miles. I was the third owner and it came with maintenance records. Never again!"

Driver seat has never heated for me (I didn't think about trying this when buying a 4 year old car in July, lesson learned). I have some rust inside the driver (lower) door and some around the sunroof, but no leaks. My son blew my front speakers a few years ago and I'm researching their replacement now.

for ""full bodied"" folks that want a 
sporty experience and still have plenty 
of room for luggage and golf clubs in 
the trunk. There's also lots of room 
for passengers in the back. It handles 
real well and ""giddy-yaps"" when you

you ""kick"" the gas pedal she jumps

I'm impressed with the gas mileage and even in this day and age can't see getting into another car payment for what, 4 to 5 more miles per gallon. The styling is still impressive when all spit and polished and the chrome wheels are buffed up. I think I'll just hang on to this ole girl."

model, I kept coming back to the 300M.  
After looking at the Acura 3.2 TL and 
Lexus ES300, my eyes were still drawn 
to the 2002 model.  For the money, 
other cars in its class cannot beat the 
styling and it also makes this family 
man with three kids still feel like he 
can have spirit in his ride - it 
beautifully blends looks, conservatism, 
and the feeling of speed into one car.

The bottom line is that when the lease 
is up on this beaut, I'm hoping that 
the convertible version will be out."

loaded intrepid ES.  It is noiser than 
a Lexus or BMW, but hey, go buy one if

Engine consumes oil like crazy. Needs new valve seals and exhaust valve springs. Abs control module is out, tires keep going flat due to aluminum rims, ac compressor is out, all four struts need to be replaced, headlight switch makes headlights turn on by themselves and drain the battery at night, Egr valve went out, constant grinding from the brakes but pads and rotors are good.

After the first week, it started overheating, after that got fix the car would randomly just shut off while driving down the road. You'd have to pull over, shut the key off, and restart it, then it would just go like normal. That ended up being something with the idle..after THAT got fixed then my radio started blaring when you touch the volume button and you can't make it stop. Then all the lights inside start to flicker and wont stop until you shut the car off. Now, my transmission just went out. I will never ever buy a Chrysler again!!! "

It's a big car and I think the styling still turns heads.  But the cabin is too noisy for a car of this value.  Over 50 mph you must yell to rear passengers.  The ride is a little bumpy but that may be the sportier suspension.  The dealer had to replace the radio in the first year, a pain but it was covered.  The rotors warped and had to be turned at 24,000 miles.  I was seriously considering a new 2006 300C, but the transmission on the 2001 went this week at 62,500 miles.  That's it for me!

I bought my 300M in January, and LOVE it. I loved the styling and all else when they came out in  '99, but when they got all the chrome in 2001, I wanted one ever so badly. Super fast for a car this size with a v6, and excellent handling on mountain roads and perfect in snow (I live in Colorado).

brake will even disengage all the time,

I purchased a 1998 Dodge Ram Van, new, and vowed that it would be the last Chrysler product that I would ever own.
The Van didn't last 10 years until it was in the junk yard.

Recently I purchased a 2001 Chrysler 300M.
The car looks really sharp and is fun to drive.
I purchased it from a dealer who gave me a great price.
I know of the previous single owner and they took great care of the car as all the records show.

Second day with the car it began to shake at 50-70 mph.
There were LOTS of new parts.

Turns out the torque converter and timing belt need replacing.
Another $3k.

I only needed to replace the brake pads.
This speaks volumes to me in terms of value and reliability , not really seen on other used cars.
While the transmission shifts ultra smooth and works as new , just like the previous owner claimed (as he said that the tranny never had any problems , just a fluid and filter change).

chrysler,300m,2002,Whalehome, 06/17/2016,"Looks good, but breaks constantly.",2,"I'm sure that when this vehicle first came out, it excited the lower end luxury buyers.

Seat warmers, 4 disc changer, tape player, electronic display showing direction, gas mileage, estimated miles remaining in the tank, temperature, even tire pressure! Sadly, these are only great features if the rest of the car runs well.

I bought the car used and in seemingly great condition, however, shortly after, the Water Pump, A/C and Timing Belt all needed to be changed. Now the transmission is dying and preventing me from registering it further unless it gets replaced. Too many problems and repairs make it a frustrating car. The lower gas mileage of about 14-17 city also makes it an expensive and frequent fill up. She looks beautiful, but she has terrible car performance.

Engine performance is very good , and fair on fuel , with it's 3.5L / 255hp (dual exhaust) application.
In my opinion , there is nothing more ""boring"" than a car (it's engine performance) , where you are repeatedly confined by it's lack of power.
I don't like driving vehicles that practically drive themselves.

raised and lowered (the dealer's solution - apply WD-40 to the glass!). 
Electrical problems damaged the transmission. I contacted Chrysler directly

chrysler,300m,2002,very unhappy, 06/01/2002,think before you buy,4,"I would suggest that you think long and 
hard before you buy a chrysler 300m.  
The car is nice with leather wall to 
wall.  Drives great but the car is not 
worth a nickel.  The car drops at least 
$5000 to $7000 in value.  If you plan 
on keeping the car it is great but it 
is easier trying to pull teeth than 
selling your car to a private buyer and 
don't even think about trading in your 
300m.  It is not worth the material put 
into building the car!!!!!!"
chrysler,300m,2002,Sean k., 06/09/2002,better than all japanese put together,5,"Don't just take my word for it.  Go to 
a dealer and test drive it for 
yourself.  My sure you have an open 
road in front of you when you step on 
the gas.  I have owned just about any 
car you can imagine.  This is one of 
the best if not the best one yet."
chrysler,300m,2002,Tom, 10/08/2009,Reliable and fun,5,"I bought the car new and have driven it 80k miles. Replaced an O2 sensor,a set of brakes at 70k and tires at 55k, went with Michelin Hydro Edge hoping to reduce tire noise, but still too loud on some concrete.  It's great to drive on the road, handles like a sport car.  Too bad the computer shuts you down at 107, as the engine is still only at 3800 rpms.The Auto Stick is fun. Put the pedal to the metal and the tach goes right up to 6400 for the next shift. The body styling was ahead of its time, as many of the new cars have nearly the same roof lines. Last weekend took a trip of 700 miles, averaged 28.2 one way and 28.8 coming home, couldn't believe it. It's the best car I have ever owned."
chrysler,300m,2002,Not sure , 12/31/2009,300M Trade In Review,4,"This car has been driven to and from work (1 mile), up to other offices within New Jersey and to the New Jersey shore.  Regular servicing by a local repair shop.  No major problems.  No accidents.  Some blind spot in the back from a wide connection between back seat window and rear window.  Other than that it has been a good car."
chrysler,300m,2002,RaeWilliams, 03/01/2002,300 M,4,"I had a 2000 300M, and loved it - but
it got totalled.  I just purchased a
new 2002 Special, and love it even
more.  It's zippy despite the fact
that I can fit 4 large adults in 
it and go out to dinner."
chrysler,300m,2002,rish, 01/12/2012,Enjoying since 2007,3,"When I was looking for a car in 2007, a chrysler 300M was not even on my shopping list. I was looking at a couple of Pontiac Grand Prix's when my eyes caught this beauty. This car stood out in a room filled with more than 50 cars at a local dealer in Toronto. After road testing it with a couple of friends in the back seat, who by the way found the back seat to be ultra comfortable with support for the back of your knee, I instantly fell in love with this car. The performance from the engine was surprising awesome for a 3.5 lt V6 in a full sized sedan and so was the handling. Every time I take this thing out for a spin, I am very confident while taking turns that it wont under or oversteer. "
chrysler,300m,2002,Floyd Carter, 08/10/2009,My 300MS,5,"Purchased the car used,w/57000 miles on the clock. Why did they stop making this model. Its a great road car. Hard to keep the speed down. Handles great on curves and runs like a race car. Love the dashboard display. The tach is a welcome site. Never had the rpms over 3000. Covers a lot of ground with comfort. Only car I have ever owned that is still fun to drive after 2yrs. If you haven't tried Continental tires,they are silent. Chrysler did a good job with this vehicle. It's a shame they stopped production. Would like to see a 5spd manual transmission. Check engine light came on and shop replaced a oxygen sensor. It still comes on, but goes off after a day or so. No major problems as yet."
chrysler,300m,2002,Zengo, 06/21/2010,When it starts to break run away!,4,"I got the car with 45,000 km paid probably more than it should have, I traded my sebring for the 300M. First year no major problems, than it started. The front suspension started braking.  I had to replace many times over the front end such as: Stabilizer bars, link-bars (upper-lower) bars, brakes etc. Parts were expensive like Mercedes or some foreign car (no wonder they are going-under). Too many electrical issues lights flashing, engine light. The sad part is, I actually liked the car and did regular maintenance. Stay away when it starts showing problems Sell fast! I had too many problems (spent over $10000.00 in repairs since 2005). "
chrysler,300m,2002,Stu, 04/06/2002,Way Too Fun To Drive,5,"Looked at all the sporty 4 door full

perfect braking."
chrysler,300m,2002,IAA, 05/18/2002,Performance and luxury.,4,"The Chrysler 300M Special edition 
offers performance and luxury in a fun 
to drive full-sized car.  It is very 
agile on the highway and offers a 
firm, but very comfortable ride.  It 
has all of the comforts and features 
of European models at about half the 
price.  This car offers excellent 
value."
chrysler,300m,2002,bobastew, 05/19/2002,Back to buying American,4,"Pound for Pound, this car stacks up 
very well with the foreign cars that 
compete in its class - Infiniti I35, 
BMW 325, Lexus ES300, etc.  Engine is 
powerful enough to get the car moving, 
autostick is a plus when you need all 
of the 255 horses at once, handling is 
great with the 18 inch wheels, and the 
interior is engineered with comfort in 
mind.  I was nervous about buying an 
American car again, but I am very happy 
that I did.  After crunching all the 
numbers and driving the competing cars, 
I believe this is one of the best 
values for around $30K  You get a lot 
of car for the dollar."
chrysler,300m,2002,Greg, 08/08/2009,My '02 300M Special,4,"This is the best Chrysler that I have owned. The car is solid and feels great at high speeds. Fuel consumption is very good for a car of its size. As a live an learn lesson, the newest Chrysler Corporation may want to look back at its front wheel drive platforms and manufacture cars that are both fun to drive and easier on gas."
chrysler,300m,2002,mgkeane, 07/03/2002,Poor Man's BMW,4,"This car is a great combination of 
power, size, interior comfort and 
all-around convenience.   The 
cab-forward design makes for an 
incredibly roomy cabin, with a back 
seat that's finally one that could be 
considered comfortable for an 
average adult.  Tremendously fun to 
drive"
chrysler,300m,2002,honestascanbe, 09/10/2010,Not too shabby,4,"I purchased this car used with high miles so my expectations weren't the greatest. The first few problems i ran into would have been minor had I owned any other domestic car. I don't understand why parts are so much and mechanics cringed at the thought of working on it. The tranny went out and drained my bank account but I have the previous owner to thank for that.  I seem to continue to have issues with the power mirrors going haywire but otherwise no electrical problems. All told, I like the looks and feel of the car and if the new tranny takes it over 200,000 miles I'll be satisfied with my investment. Provided nothing else major goes wrong."
chrysler,300m,2002,Very Unsatisfied, 07/15/2002,Very Unhappy,3,"Purchased this vehicle and was in the 
service department for the first 8 
weeks of owning it.  On top of shimmy 
going down road, this car had a custom 
paint job contracted by the 
Dealership.  The paint continually 
chipped off and nobody at the 
dealership wanted to take any 
responsibility.  Once you leave the 
lot, don't call them, they are not 
concerned with your problems or your 
return purchase.  Finally unloaded this 
car for a Toyota Avalon XLS and love 
this car.  Sight was bad in the 300M."
chrysler,300m,2002,budoinst, 07/18/2002,Fine auto,4,"I am very pleased with the 300. It has 
handled all types of weather conditions 
and road surfaces. It is wonderfully 
soothing on long trips, leaving one 
with a relaxed feeling when arriving. 
The outside continually receives 
atares, particularly with the red paint 
that I have. It is the first American 
car I have purchased in 20 years, so it 
obviously spoke to me loudly. I am very 
pleased to have it and would suggest it 
strongly as a fine auto for the money 
and the value."
chrysler,300m,2002,DaveRT, 07/30/2002,300M,4,"Love the elegant interior. Always

You get near luxury options wrapped up with a decent body/engine.  I would be upset if I had paid 30k.  12k was better.

drive.  Lots of great features that 
are simple and easy to operate.  
However, the A/C leaves a lot to be 
desired, very slow to cool the 
interior and has to work hard to stay 
at a constant temp.  (My 2001 Grand 
Caravan Sport company car has a much 
better A/C at a lower sticker price.)  
And two trips to the dealership has 
not seem much improvement."
chrysler,300m,2002,cosmicbandito, 07/11/2002,High Maintenance,4,"Car has electrical gremlins that appear 
and disappear. With high mileage use, 
3000 mile oil changes become 
burdensome. My BMw needed only 10000 
mile changes, same with my Mercedes. 
The 300M is more comfortable than 
either of the other cars. If I followed 
the dealer service recommendations the 
300M would cost substantially more to 
maintain than the BMW or MBZ."

Buick, Lincoln, Volvo, and Chrysler. 
The only automaker that came close was 
Volvo; the deciding factor was that my 
grandmother chose not to get another 
station wagon. I am the ""car buff"" of 
the family so my grandmother and I 
searched together. My Grandfather has 
a '98 Town Car and has nothing but 
problems with it, so we were not crazy 
of Lincoln to start with.  We have also 
had Very Horrible experiences with GM.

chrysler,300m,2002,BioMan, 06/10/2004,Attention to detail?,4,"We bought this car for roadtrips and 
it performs quite well in that 
respect.  Mileage is a little 
concerning around town (~18mpg) but on 
the hwy is quite nice (~26mpg).  This 
car is soooo smooth and powerfull its 
almost too easy to speed. But whats 
with the 110mph speed limiter? My 
biggest gripe with the 300M is in its 
interior quiality.  Cheap plasic 
pieces that dont quite fit together 
produce annoying rattles in the dash, 
doors and headliner. Maybe Chrysler 
should speak to the folks at Audi 
about this issue...  Overall a good 
touring car for those who like high 
speeds and a roomy comfortable 
interior."

That is where is all stops, I road noise is like driving a pick up truck, you feel every bump and crack in the road, very disappointing in these area. Fuel ecomomy has run 20 combine highway and city, I thought that would be better for a V6, inside is comfortable, the AC is bad also, but everything is black inside, another mistake, rotor's are always rusting and making a mess on the garage floor. In short I can not wait until I get back to a Lincoln, have not had a Chrsyler for 32 years and hope never to have another"
chrysler,300m,2002,employee, 03/29/2002,Typical Chysler Quality,3,"My 300M looks great and performs as advertised.   But as with all Chrysler products, the dealership is poor and the my number of repairs are typical with poor US quality.   My passenger window would not roll down after the 1st month.   On the 2nd month, the dashboard split open where the passenger air bag is.   On course, it took weeks for the dealer fix the dash.   Only days for the window.  Unfortunately, I am a Chrysler employee, so I need to support my company and buy this junk.   Maybe after we lose more market share, management and the union will work together to produce a good car."

Handles great, fast (too fast?), roomy, room for 2 + golf bags in the trunk but noisey from road noise.  OEM tires lasted 20,000 at $300/each.  All in all next time I'd buy somethink else.

Chrysler issued a fix for the sound

and out. Very roomy. The engine has 
good pickup. The road noise is near 
intolerable--the Firebird we had 
before this car had wind noise, the 
300M has *road* noise and it is loud. 
The stereo is okay and really like 
having 10 radio presets. Gas mileage 
is poor. Visibility to the rear (out 
the window and in the mirrors) is very 
poor. Headlights flicker slightly when 
pressing on the brakes. Mirror toggle 
switch broke early on (repaired under 
warranty). Glovebox plunger switch was 
so strong as to push out glovebox door 
slightly--over a couple of months it 
warped the door!

chrysler,300m,2002,Gorn, 06/16/2004,My thoughts of the 2002 300M,4,"I've owned my 300M Special for 2 
years.  I gave me a compromise between 
having a fun car to drive and being 
able to haul the family around.  
Service from the dealership has been 
great with one exception.  They didn't 
do a thorough review of the car before 
it was delivered to me.  The air didn't 
work"
chrysler,300m,2002,Amfamman, 03/15/2003,Jury still out,4,"After owning my 300M for one year, I 
have mixed feelings.  Style both 
interior and exterior are excellent, 
except it is hard to see out back 
window when reversing.  Auto 
transmission shift from 1st to 2nd 
comes too soon for impresssive 
acceleration.  Wind noise is 
intrusive.  But car is responsive, fun-
to-drive, fast, distinctive, and 
generates lots of compliments."
chrysler,300m,2002,Poconos Bill, 07/31/2005,It is Special,5,"I've driven this fine car for 3 years and have no unusual maintenance needs (only"" oil changes; Brake Pads and Tires at 40,000).   I've enjoyed the Interstate Highway and secondary road competence. The only worry I have is the natural tendency to exceed any speed limit!  Some Tram Line agravation when I purchased this care was acutally loose lug nut related! (resolved with torque wrench check).  I love driving this car in the warm months - It stays mostly garaged in the winter as the tires ""Michelin Pilot Sports"" are not good in snow (and you are so warned when you buy these tires).  This M is special.  "
chrysler,300m,2002,Peggster, 03/18/2003,Fun for me..,4,"Fun to drive. Electrical anomolies in 
the dash. Love the power. Rear view is 
bothersome. I just use the side 
mirrors. I travel 100 miles to and from 
so the comfort is needed. But the trade-
in value is way too low on this car. If 
you only want it a short time, find 
another car. Large seating area and 
fold down seats make this car a smart 
decision for me. Lots of room for Home 
Depot purchases."
chrysler,300m,2002,Ryan, 07/29/2006,Average Guy's Performance Sedan,4,"From its introduction in 1999, I've been in love with the 300M. I bought a 2002 model used. The styling is aggressive but not cluttered. Interior space is larger than expected, and the leather seats are very comfortable. Good support under the thighs, which is usually a big problem for me. Instrumentation is classy and simple. The engine provides a lot of power, and has a great growl at high RPMs. My 300M is a lot of fun to drive, as it hugs the road more like a sports car than a 4-door sedan. Steering is precise with a good feel for the road. There is an unbelievable amount of space in the trunk--larger than my old '95 Concorde! Managed to get 27 mpg on a road trip. I love this car!"
chrysler,300m,2002,M, 11/18/2006,nice car for the money,4,"I got it 1 year ago. First of all, when I hear about road noise I will say check you tires, I got new set form tire rack, avon tires, those are grat both in noise, handling and price, half of what you have to pay for Michelins. Overall I will say that the car is fun to drive, I like it. Exchanging brake pads from standard metal to ceramic (cost the same) would get rid off the brake dust, great."
chrysler,300m,2002,David, 12/01/2006,Good Used Car,4,Funny that I just replaced the Michelins on mine with Avons too and it made a huge difference in road noise. Overall a beautiful car design that is aging well. I looked and looked and finally decided on this for my $10k used car purchase. I don't think you will find another car out there in the price range with all of the equipment. Car handles well and has decent power.  Interior design and fit definitely lags behind imports.  Gas mileage is poor too. Overall nice size and plenty of room.  
chrysler,300m,2002,S.Allen, 03/28/2003,Bitter Sweet,3,"I am discouraged with the steering on

many compliments."

Hit a bump and the orangy OBD (On Board Diagnostics) light came on [not to be confused with 'check engine']  Thankfully it was just a sensor, and it was reset, but the car is built like an airplane, with a zillion sensors that monitor everything except what you are listening to.  It adjusts temperature and seats, and this and that and wow is all I can say.  "

chrysler,300m,2002,LeeG, 03/11/2002,Great Value,4,"As a salesman I need plenty of room for customers, kids, literature, and samples.  This car has it all.  The trunk in huge, the styling is elegant, the back seat seats 3 adults comfortably (even with my drivers seat all the way back), and the performance is impressive.  With 250 horsepower and a relatively tight suspension I am satisfied.  The interior is sleak and the sound system is outstanding.  Foreign cars are too expensive and most are much smaller inside."

I was pulled over by a cop, who told me that my brake light had been illuminated for a lengthy period.  A few days later, I couldn't get the brake light to go out after I parked the car!!  I took the car to a Toronto dealer, who discovered that a connection to the brake light had shorted out.   It took them 13 days to get a replacement part, even though the car is built in Toronto.  As the car was too dangerous for me to drive, they provided me with a replacement car -- a KIA (!!).  Go figure."

The car has been solid. I first changed the front brakes at 87,000 miles and just did the rear at 107,000. I am still waiting to do a tuneup and change the original battery. More of the belts and hoses along with a radiator were redone at 63,000 miles when I hit a deer on the highway. The car has always had a fade to the left driving on the highway and the check engine light has been on since 24,000 miles(no one can seem to fix that), but I certainly a pleased with the car. There have been no major problems with the car and it has been reliable. A good car."

At first it was really fun to drive it handled great, sounded great really comfortable. In 2013 it had a Rod berring issue and the engine had to be replaced. It was replaced with a new engine with 80k mi. it lasted a year December 2014 with rod berring issues again. Replaced it again with 80k mi costing $1,100 (only cause its bank owned). The Chrysler 300m special has a bad engine which is the EGK engine only made for the Special with 255hp. Chrysler never recalled it. So if you buy this car at 115k and its the Special get ready for a Headache."

Up to spec with most new cars in terms of power, handling, looks, overall enjoyability. Interior should be an upgrade from standard Chrysler fare for the 300m but is okay with the carbon fiber trim though. Car has plenty of power, interior room, great handling, and is stone cold reliable. The 18"" wheels definitely make the car noisier, though. Also, the ""special"" is lower in the front so watch out for those high curbs! If you hit one it can bring the bumper out of alignment. Drawbacks of having a performance car. Absolutely love this car, they should have kept this one and made the newer 300 separate"

The exterior of this vehicle is fairly nice, and the interior is roomy and comfortable. That is the good.
It chews up rotors and pads.
The paint started coming off at 90,000 miles.
I have replaced 7 crank shaft sensors, 5 cam shaft sensors, 1 A/C compressor, at least 9 windshield wipers, and the oil has leaked since the week we bought it.
It stalls all the time, and now the tranny is starting to go out.
All I do is feel sorry for anyone who buys a car made by this company.

Both are fine cars, but the Special was spectacular in comparison.  It had larger wheels, better suspension, better looks, two tone interior and I feel like it even performed better.

Besides one poor sensor, which caused my car to turn off while I was driving, I have had no problems. I bought a full warranty on it so I guess it will cover the sensor change.

somewhat disconcerting to drive such a 
big, American car that truly handles 
like a smaller, imported sport sedan.  
But this unusual combination 
(especially at this price) makes for a 
unique driving experience that captures 
quality sport performance, great 
comfort/space, in a design that is 
surprisingly both classic and hot rod.  
An oddball indeed, but the probably the 
best value out there for a car that 
really does capture so many elements, I 
find it highly satisfying."

think I will be driving in the snow

exeption is the so called 360 watt

The speakers have no base and when you

The Special has met, and exceeded that model in every way, and I've only driven it 1500 miles! Plus, my graphite gray and charchol model is a great looker too! The only exception was that it didn't shift right until I changed the air filter, now it can show its stuff, and it's tail. It has almost all the features that Specials come with except the Nav/Satellite radio, and U-Connect, both on my wish list. Space, looks, comfort, higher performance, and the bells and whistles, make this a driver's dream. Today's gas prices make it a real value too."

I have serious issues with some of the engine failure reports I read on this site since I drive my 300m very hard and have hit the 6500 rpm redline very often with no engine issues at all. I had over 135k on my first one and 125k on my present 300m special and the biggest problem I had was a failed Japanese Denso map sensor at 120k miles. I replaced with the original with a better quality Mopar US version for 35.00. These are good reliable cars if maintained correctly with fluid changes as required in the owners manual. Also only use the lighter weight oil they tell you to use, using too heavy an oil and the bearings will spin in any newer engine!!!

get up and go.  However, the ride is 
VERY rough and the road/tire noise is 
always present.  The car looks great 
and you feel good driving it.  You just 
have to put up with the unforgiving 
tires/shocks and turning the stereo up 
a bit more than you normally would.  
It's thirsty too, but no more so than 
any other vehicle with wide, V-rated 
tires.  With all the deals now being 
given on 2003 and 2004's, I'm afraid 
there won't be much resale value.  "

it, we just wanted a new car.  In 
fact, this car was very easy to love 
and we consdered buying another as its 
replacement.  Our other car is a 1996 
911, so we are used to quality and  
performance.  The 300's performance 
felt much better than the review 
numbers say.  It's a very satisfying 
car to drive quickly on the interstate

not leather, its' a man made 
matedrial.  Lately the engine seems to 
have a mind of its own as it adopts the 
trait of crues control at speeds less 
than 50 mph and when creus is not on.  
Dealer cannot find it.  I'm always 
ridding the brake.  The shifting sensor 
recently quit.  Cost to repair $185.00! 
and a full day, no loaner either.  
Heating and air conditioning stinks.  
Dealer says they cannot clean filter 
without tearing the whole interior 
apart.  Costly.  Smells for 5 to 10 
minutes."

friendly too.  The front wheel drive 
with sports suspension holds the road

something to be desired, the quick 
acceleration and excellent brakes make 
this family car fun to drive.  Trunk

they had to reapply the adhsive to the 
clip that holds the window in place, 
that along with replacing a tranformer 
(?) in the engine so the fan would not 
run continuously, even thought it still 
does.  The car has plenty of get up and

It met and exceeded my expectations in all categories with the exeption of quality.  At about 40,000 mile it developed a leak from the transmission lines that needed replacement - $200 to fix - just as the vehicles warranty had expired.  Secondly I had falures with the vehicles Air Bag system that were replaced under warranty after 10 visits to the dealership.  I cannot be certain if it was the mechanics working on it or the parts they used, but 10 visits to the dealer on a 2 year old car seemed extremely excessive!  The ABS system was fixed under warranty though."

many others have fallen in love with
this car.  This may be the best car that
Chysler built in 2003.  The new 300/300C

chrysler,300m,2003,K. Bronstrup, 03/04/2007,Good Styling Otherwise Disappointing,3,"We traded in a 96 Jeep Grand Cherokee on this vehicle. Gas mileage averages 21 MPH mostly open road driving (worse than our Jeep). Since we bought the car we've lost all the transmission fluid due to a 99 cent clamp coming loose. We were quoted over $175.00 to replace a simple plastic clamp that secures the transmission lines to the case. The power moon roof broke and it cost us $25 to get an estimate of $1,350 to repair it (we wont bother). Overall quality is quite poor compared to Toyota, Ford or Mercedes. Due to the ridiculous cost of repair and maintenance this will be our last Chrysler FOREVER. On a positive note we have always liked the styling of the 300M."

They were both associated with the transmission...A trans light on the dash  which was reset by Mobil station Mechanic in July 2006 with no problem detected and a software update installed by Chrysler dealer in March 2007  which corrected a slight ""hitch""in the transmission when it shifted from 3rd to 4th gear.The only other""problem"" is with the ""air dam"" which is very low in front and has a tendency to ride onto the concrete car stops in every parking lot if I'm not careful.It is a little annoying to say the the least.Otherwise, its change oil and filters,gas-up and go (22 mpg). I also own a '93 Jeep Wrangler."

Which can not compair to this rocket ship. The only problem I have had is that there is a left pull, and the front end shop says they cant set the caster, for there is no adjustments for it. The settings are reversed from what they should be (31/2 left 21/2 right. when I get this corrected I know I will be in love for sure."

loving all the features others have 
written about, I was disappointed that 
the passenger's side mirror does not 
tilt in reverse like in earlier 
models.  I believe that is the ONLY 
thing I am disappointed in with this 
car.  Tight steering in high speeds, 
and it has get up and go.  I love the

it may be a different story (non-

The car has 237,000kms on it and is in completely original condition.

Being the second owner , the original owner obviously had it in a garage since new and took good care of it , without needing anything at all.
Judging by the short time I have had it , it is the best used car I have yet to see.
The car was starting and running fine (no ticking sounds or noises) , even while the sparkplugs were still the originals.
Even the air conditioning outclasses most others I have seen.
It has not needed any service."

It's embarrassing to have people in this car cause they can't put down the window. Don't judge a carby its looks, Chrysler builds garbage and it's no surprise they are in financial turmoil! I researched this car or 4 months before purchased and all reviews are ""great"".  This is the honest truth about this vehicle- don't buy one. And I bought the 80,00 warranty. "
chrysler,300m,2004,BoeingB17FF, 04/07/2010,Not the Cadillac I expected as a kid.,4,"This car exceeds what I wanted in a car as a kid - classy styling - by adding aggressive handling.  Boasting head-turning looks, it has no problem flying around corners near the speed limit with little assistance from the brakes.  It's capable of stopping fast enough that I'm worried about air bags deploying.  Sluggish out of early gears.  Has no problem picking up speed at higher speeds.  Mine was purchased used.  After manufacturer PCM reprog for Tranny control error code, the system shifts gorgeously.  Bad for the wallet as it coaxes me into driving 'a few extra miles'."

It will fly on the freeway, and rumble impressively in town. The 3.5 litre motor has loads of power. The interior design, bells & whistles are first class. However, it is scared of snow. Even changing to snow tires, the car is skittery and quite nerve wracking. It uses up brake pads every 10K miles. As mentioned in other reviews, the low profile causes the front spoiler to hang up on parking blocks, ripping the front facia loose. It's prone to have expensive climate control problems. The failure of an engine cam sensor nearly caused a major freeway accident."

It was great on the interstate or letting loose on county roads.  However, I got to drive dealership loaners more than I got to drive this car.  Purchased with 18,000 miles on it. This car had been babied & I babied it.  It leaked transmission fluid non-stop.  Thankfully I had a warranty, it was a $100 deductible each time it went in [7 total] which got to be steep but not as bad as the $1,100 they would've charged without the warranty.

sports car. Way To Go Chrysler!!!!!! "
chrysler,300m,2004,kajjax, 09/17/2003,Kaj's Take,2,"Generally have enjoyed the vehicle, 
like it's sleek and understated design, 
have found it to be somewhat unreliable 
having to have several major overhauls 
already!"
chrysler,300m,2004,clem6, 08/13/2003,pretty good,4,"Its a good car but at $30k some of the 
details and quality are not great.  
I've had several minor electrical 
problems.  She runs nicely but 
sometimes the acceleration is sluggish.
The car is also noisy and one of the 
door speakers rattles when the base is 
turned up.

Its a good looking car that is fun to 
drive."
chrysler,300m,2004,Extremely satisfied, 09/24/2003,An awesome car!!!,4,"This car handles like it is on rails, 
the brakes and steering are spectacular 
to say the least.  The fit and finish 
are outstanding.  The ground effects 
are a nice added touch and are 
understated and the dual exhaust, all I 
can say is, WOW!!!  I have loved this 
car ever since it came out in 1999 and 
I never thought I would own one but the 
deals they are offering on this car 
make it very affordable and an 
outstanding value."
chrysler,300m,2004,Big Gregg, 09/30/2003,Wanna have fun? Buy one!!!!!1,5,"This thing is a blast!!!  Handles well, 
quick, roomy for me (6'4"" 240#).  
Tremendous bang for the $$$$  With the 
Performance Package (read DELETE 
Electronic speed limiter)it will do 
145+...big time fun!!!!!"
chrysler,300m,2004,JLS, 10/03/2003,Serota Report,3,"Paint is very poor, scratch's very
easily. Very areodynamic thus if you are
a smoker ashes fly back into the
vehicle. Lighter is very poorly placed.
If you aror all the dash for a high
shine you will not be able to clearly
see through the windshield in sunny
conditions."
chrysler,300m,2004,pworks, 10/08/2003,Was going to buy a Lexus or Infiniti!,4,"I accidentally bought my 300M for a 
number of different reasons. My 
intention was to get a Lexus but after 
driving the 300M I liked it better than 
than new 330 and musch better than the 
Infiniti. I think this is one of the 
best values of any car I have seen.
I highly recommend this even to those 
who are considering the imported luxury 
cars. It is every bit as much car."

several competing brands.  I 
previously owned a Dodge Intrepid and 
loved it......so after driving the 
Grand Marquis and even the Maxima, I 
found that the 300M had just the right 
mix of room and performance.  The 
Maxima is great, but doesn't have the 
room the 300M has, and the Marquis is 
good, but doesn't handle like the 
300M.  I'm impressed."

chrysler,300m,2004,rfbreton, 10/20/2003,The most beautiful American car,4,"My 300M is Inferno Red with factory 
chrome wheels and a moonroof.  It is 
the most fun car I have ever owned, and 
it is the best kept secret in the 
world.  I have driven it through the 
mountain roads of Colorado at altitudes 
of over 10,000 ft. and the AUTOSTICK 
feature of the transmission was a 
fabulous tool allowing me to safely 
control the speed of my descent with 
minimal use of brakes.  I have averaged 
28 mpg highway and 22 mpg city, but the 
3.5L V-6 is ready to sprint at any 
time.    Chrysler has done a great job 
of proving that you don't have to spend 
$50,000 dollars to own a reliable, high 
performance good-looking car... and you 
CAN buy American."

more than I had hoped for...design, 
performance, value.  All the 
accoutrements in a top-notch piece of 
equipment are here.  My prior vehicle 
was a loaded '99 Concorde and this car 
blows it away in most every respect.  
Driving this 300 is a joy I really look 
forward to and highly recommend the 
automobile. "
chrysler,300m,2004,Frederick Jacobs, 10/25/2003,Problems With Design Of Car,4,"First the front end sits to low to the 
ground,when you pull into a parking 
space watch out for the cement tire 
stop because your bumper skirt will go 
over it and when you back up it hangs 
up and tears it loose from where it is 
fasten to the fender with screws and 
will scrape the paint off every time . 
The second thing there is a MAJOR 
SAFETY HAZZARD in this car that at the 
time of purchase they dont tell you 
about and that is until you read your 
owners manual will you find out it has 
to do with people that have pacemakers 
or know some one with one before riding 
in this vehicle, it has to do with the 
TIRE PRESSURE MONITOR SYSTOM."
chrysler,300m,2004,K0VH, 04/12/2005,300M still the best,4,"We bought a loaded new 300M a year ago, liking the style and needing FWD vs at the time the new 300 mobsta cars were only RWD. A year later we are very very satisfied, our first auto -ever- with NO warranty problems!!  Great styling, performance, handling and LOTS of interior room and comfort. You should be able to get good deals on used models with the same 3.5L V6 the new 300s have. The car handled well in the snow, heated seats worked great. Read the edmunds.com forum to see how many remain commited to this even since it initially came out in 99."

1/4 inch. Not a significant amount of

numerous vehicles, I finally decided on
a 2004 Chrysler 300M Special.  The car
is absolutely beautiful to look at, and
a blast to drive.  With a $4,000 rebate
and dealer discounts, I purchased the
vehicle for slightly less than
Edmunds.com TMV (which is a bargain!). 
I considered waiting for the 2005,
however after seeing the new design (and
price increase!), it was an easy
decision to stick with the 2004.  I
believe it looks much better than the
2005.  The car is sporty, roomy, and (I
hate to use this word) practical. 
Plenty of room, power and looks for anyone. "

car for the buck but the radio and the 
CD Player have each had their time to 
blow and therefore both were replaced 
within three months of one-another.  
Also, little noises from the dash would 
come and go.  While these little 
rattles didn't interfere with 
performance, they were annoying and of 
course when I would bring the car to 
the dealer, the noises would suddenly 
disappear.  The car has a lot of power

continue to enjoy driving it (with the 
exception of the occasional rattles)."

real looker as well as handy navigation 
system and MASSIVE trunk all while 
keeping her rear end tight.

The interior is gorgeous.  From the 
leather seats to the partial wooden 
steering wheel and dash, this car just 
screams class.  The stereo isn't quite 
as refined as you might expect, so 
don't expect to blast it without some

too uncertain about the Hemi in a 
MultiDisplacement version (Where 
cylinders cut in and out depending 
upon acceleration) in the first year

problem in Chrysler automobiles. The 
rear right window does not work and my 
trunk button on the inside does not 
work as well. The alignment needs to be 
fixed as well. Other than all that I

chrysler,300m,2004,Unhappy wayne, 06/02/2003,Chrysler isn't the car for you,4," My new car has dimples or dents and 
bondo holes in the roof quarter panels. 
Theirs also trash in the paint job. It 
looks like a $300 paint job. The 
factory rep said it was commercial 
grade and good enough. They did 
agree to fix the rust I found on the 
seams that I found when I pulled up the 
rubber by the quarter panels. I wish I 
never heard of Chrysler. Their were 
other problems also. I picked this car 
up in the rain thinking they would fix 
any problems I would fine later. Never 
again"

chrysler,300m,2004,Stacey, 03/27/2008,Best car I've owned,4,"I absolutely love this car...  I've only had it for 9 months but it is the best.  The only thing I've had to have replace was the a/c evaporator core but that, I hear, is a common fault in the Chrysler 300M.  This car handles great on turns and curves and the gas mileage is pretty good for a 3.5 V6.  The only complaint I have is the small gas tank."

In 2011 the dealer convinced me to try the 300 limited and I have been never disappointed with the performance of the car so far. I have now put 168,000 miles on the car and it still drives like  great.   I intend keeping the car   for some more years.

Bought it to tow a travel trailer.
Had no idea how luxurious it was.
Have been in Escalades, Tahoes, Burbs, etc.....this one has them all beat and costs WAAAAY less.

I get 20-23 on the highway, empty, and got an honest, pen and paper, 12 at 9000 ft, towing a 7400 lb. travel trailer.

Quiet, smooth, with all-weather confidence, and did I mention towing ability ?

When my mechanic checked it out before purchase, he was amazed at the structural integrity: ""You will win any collision""."
chrysler,aspen,2007,tuna66, 03/08/2014,Outstanding vehicle,4,"I purchased a new 5.7 4x4 Aspen new in August 2008.
To date, this has been the most reliable 
vehicle I have ever owned.
125,000 trouble free miles.
I have replaced one set of front and rear brakes, battery and two sets of tires, and that is all.
The suv rides like it did at 25,000 miles.
I would buy another in a second.
I live in Upstate NY and the bottom of all 4 doors are rotting.
This rig is thirsty.
Other than the rusting doors, this is one well built SUV."
chrysler,aspen,2007,Phillip, 11/25/2006,Impartial review - rental,3,"Rented for the Thanksgiving week, drove about 1200 miles round trip.  Before driving: A very executive, commanding looking SUV. Smart and simply elegant interior design, most everything intuitive. Driver position very nice and adjustable. Lots of nice controls on the wheel.  Driving: Be easy on the gas because despite its size, this SUV will put you in the back of your seat and keep you there through the smooth shifts.  Tires and shocks smooth away most jars yet you maintain a nice feel for the road. Road is nicely illuminated with the foglight combo.  Aspen makes the long haul trip easy, in town driving very manageable but keep your gas card at the ready and plenty of braking room."
chrysler,aspen,2007,Dennis Williams, 12/14/2006,Look Of Luxury,4,"It has the looks, comfort, & amenities of a SUV priced thousands more. The third row has enough room for adults. It has the power to pull my boat & it fits in the garage."

What a great all-round suv built by Daimler Chrysler!"
chrysler,aspen,2007,azmomof3, 07/05/2010,Love my Aspen!,4,"We have had our Aspen 5.7L Hemi for 3 years now.  We bought it brand new for the lifetime Powertrain warranty.  We wanted a vehicle that would tow and boy does this baby deliver!  We currently tow a 5500 lb. travel trailer and our Aspen pulls it seamlessly.  We pass larger vehicles going up mountains. My husband likes to say, ""Yeah, that's my Hemi passing you!""  We also wanted seating for extra kids and got the 8 passenger model.  Ride is so quiet - after 3 years of living on a bumpy road, we don't hear any rattles, or squeaks at all.  Brakes have not gone out in 3 years either.  Only thing changed out was rack and pinon steering, after 2 years of ownership. Aspen is a reliable work horse! "

We were looking for an SUV and saw this one, took it for a drive and were hooked right away. The comfort for my husband, who is disabled, was a big seller.
The luxury of the interior, with all the extras were just perfect.
 The price was affordable which really surprised us too."
chrysler,aspen,2007,Budd50, 01/02/2007,Very nice SUV,4,Chose this vehicle over Tahoe and Jeep Commander. Plenty of room for six adults. Handles very well. Excellent fit and finish. Bought with the HEMI.
chrysler,aspen,2007,BDBobo, 07/21/2009,Great Vehicle,4,I really like the style and comfort.  It is especially nice when compared to the competition and how much more their vehicles are.  This tows more than almost any other SUV and the gas mileage isn't great but it's good for an SUV.  It does better than my wife's Jeep Commander with the 4.7l V-8.  And it does almost as well with mpg on the highway as my wife's old 2005 mini van.  This is a great vehicle for the price and has been extremely reliable.
chrysler,aspen,2007,dscott05, 01/19/2007,Love the Hemi!,5,"Wow!  Nice to see an American Made  SUV of such high quality. Quality is evident everywhere - from the wood steering wheel, to the super comfortable leather. WE LOVE IT!  The stability control feature works like a wonder driving in a Snow storm. The HEMI engine is much more powerful than the Sequoia we drive, and the vehicle feels more substantial.  We loved the Five Star treatment at the dealership. So friendly and helpful!  This is our First Chrysler - but I'm thinking it won't be the last!  Good Job Chrysler!"

chrysler,aspen,2007,james, 09/18/2006,you did it right,5,Has the look of a Pacifica with the room of a suv. Design similarities like the ribbed hood have crossed over from the crossfire. Handles well not sluggish and does not wallow like some big suv's. Will tow my boat as well as haul my kids their friends and the dogs. Am very happy with it.
chrysler,aspen,2007,BRAE, 11/22/2009,2007 Chrysler Aspen,4,2007 Chrysler Aspen is one of the best cars I have ever owned. I leased the vechicle for 27 months then bought the car. Fuel economy is 14 city and 19-20 highway just as they have reported. I ordered this vechicle with everything and could not be more pleased with the performance and quality. A lot of car for the money especially when you compare with others in this class.  Very disappointed they will not continue to make in the future.
chrysler,aspen,2007,Mike, 04/15/2010,Great Vehicle,4,"We bought this used with 26,000 miles on it and are now at 36,000 miles.  It has every option besides the Navigation/DVD.  The HEMI is amazing and we love the style and how it rides.  Our 5 year old is able to get into the 3rd row seating by himself.  The 3rd row is spacious but a little bumpy riding back there.  The only issues that we have had were with the tie-rods and with the rear assist system.  Two sensors have had to be replaced.  Great Ride and we plan on driving it till it dies."
chrysler,aspen,2007,geswho69, 10/16/2011,Had it a year so far.,4,"We bought our Aspen 5.8l Limited Aspen in October '10.
It was used with about 90k km.
First the bad. The gas tank non-return fails. It was broken when we got it, gas spews out when it's full. 
Tires: The shipped Wrangler tires are no longer available. 1 flat = 4 new tires :(
That's it for the bad :D

Short answer, we still love it.

The ride is good, and comfortable. The finish is fine and mostly solid. 
Mileage is fair for a beast this size. The MDS is out of your control. Highway mileage was not THAT far off from a minivan, in city mileage is not so great.
The seats are very comfortable, and the uconnect is great.
Towing is un-noticable!

Short answer, you'll love this SUV."

chrysler,aspen,2007,~m~, 06/05/2008,Awesome ride...but we're trading down.,4,"We love our Aspen, it handles well and the bells and whistles are awesome. We haven't had any malfunctions to speak of, although my husband has noticed something strange at the pumps, he often fills up when the needle is on E, and as he fills the tank he expects the gallons on the pump to match what he knows the tank should hold, the numbers come close to matching. It's as if there's a few unrecorded gallons left in his tank (but it's a significant amt). The dealer has checked it out too, and no one can explain it. It's weird.  Our one complaint, the rear seats are FIXED. They cannot be slid forward or backward by the occupant to accommodate a tall driver or someone in the 3rd row!"
chrysler,aspen,2007,TN_SWEET_COWGRL, 08/08/2008,2007 Aspen,4,"I got mine with 2 miles on it pay cash for it .

chrysler,aspen,2007,Shane_WI, 02/15/2008,2007 Bought in 2008,4,"Certainly fun to drive with an excellent ride. Feels like a heavier vehicle with tremendous power (Hemi). 18 inch wheels offer nice handling and smooth ride. Lots of compliments on looks. Installed satellite (Sirius) at dealer. $700 compared to $185 from factory; so get it from factory if can. At 6' 3"", the door entry is small and seat is not wide for large behind.  UConnect is awesome. Rear storage is small with 3rd row up.  The lack of dual zone (driver/passenger) climate control is strange for vehicle that lists for $42,500; same comment for satellite. Interior is attractive, but leather is stiff. The small glove box on dash is annoying; center console is deep but awkward to access. "
chrysler,aspen,2007,jpeltier, 02/24/2008,Greatest ever!,5,"This SUV is fanatastic! I had an Expedition for a little while a couple of years ago but quickly traded it in because it felt and drove like a truck. The Aspen is a dream. I traded in my Pacifica which I loved for a little more room. Initially, I was worried about the ride but that was needless. It drives and feels like a car. "
chrysler,aspen,2007,GRB, 10/18/2006,Big bold and a dream to drive,4,"Wonderful ride quality at an exceptionally good price. Good equipment level and nice finishing touches. The ride is positive, comfortable and at all times you feel under control, despite the large size. Build appears solid and have not noted any drifting at sharper turns. "
chrysler,aspen,2007,Bucky Dent, 09/25/2007,Chrysler's invisible winner,4,"Chrysler has an invisible winner in the Aspen. We selected the Aspen after testing the following SUVs: Tahoe, Escalade, Yukon, Navigator, Commander, and Sequoia. None of them came equipped with as many standard features as the Aspen for less money. The ride, fit & finish, performance and looks are standouts in the SUV crowd. The 5.7 Hemi has terrific performance and decent mileage if you keep your foot out of the throttle. Its a shame Chrysler toss more advertising dollars at this vehicle to increase customer awareness. Im constantly getting complements and questions at the gas station with this rig.  "
chrysler,aspen,2007,Double B, 08/03/2007,Best hidden gem of all SUVs on market,5,"One word:  phenomenal. The second I saw a printed ad of this vehicle, I told my wife ""that's it.""  We'd been shopping for 12-18 months.  I rented one on a business trip and immediately began visiting dealerships upon returning.  Bought one used, saved thousands, couldn't be happier.  Were leaning toward a 2007 Yukon/Tahoe, but their 3rd seat has to be lifted out, doesn't mostly fold into floor like the Aspen.  Ridiculous. I'm an older Gen X'er and I still get told ""sweet ride"" by the younger crowd.  My kids are thrilled, wife hauls the groceries seemlessly, and I just punch the Hemi when hauling our boat.  Superb vehicle. This is the sleeper SUV no one's talking about."
chrysler,aspen,2007,AHurst, 09/02/2007,Value Leader,3,"Bought a Yukon Denali in March 07. Sold it 90 days later because I hated the 3rd row seats that had to be removed. To replace it, I test drove a Jeep Commander, Mercedes GL 450, Nissan Armada & Pathfinder, Infiniti QX56, Toyota 4Runner, Ford Explorer & Expedition, Acura MDX, etc.-all with fold flat 3rd rows. With 3 kids, I need separation on trips. The most accommodating vehicle in terms of comfort and functionality was the Expedition. 3rd row is comfortable even for adults. Steering is accurate and has good feel. Seats are fantastic. But V8 is weak! Jeep Commander (Hemi) was next and had more features than Aspen (i.e. rain sensing wipers), but interior was too tight. Aspen had same Hemi."
chrysler,aspen,2007,WWooten, 10/27/2007,So far so Good,4,"This SUV is the bomb. I get compliment after compliment on it.  It's loaded and I feel rich driving it. It came with a lifetime powertrain warranty, however, I purchased the extended bumper to bumper warranty which is lifetime as well. Yes, I said lifetime bumber to bumper. What can I say, I have had past problems with American made vehicles.  Although, I doubt it will give me as many problems as my Chevy Trailblazer and Buick Rendezvous.  That Hemi just hums.

I'm retired now and don't drive a lot anymore so mpg not an issuse for me, but I had back surgery and my Durango was very uncomfotable after that. The wife said ""do not bring home a white car"" so this vanilla color bailed me out! I average 14 mpg around town, my first Hemi got 8 and, I like having the accelleration getting onto the expressway and passing. My adult kids call it dad's pimp mobile. "
chrysler,aspen,2007,Lady Di, 05/11/2009,Love My Vehicle!!,4,"I definately would give give this SUV a FIVE-STAR.  It is such a great vehicle to drive.  It's reliable, classy, and fun. All the kids and their friends fit in just fine.  When it's just the adults, it's certainly a nice ride.  I compare it to the other SUV's out their, and this one tops them all, especially the for the price you pay.  Chrysler did good, just wish you were continuing to make them.  My lease is coming up and I now want a HEMI.  Oh, what's a girl to do!!!"
chrysler,aspen,2007,Lorne, 01/12/2008,After one year its still a lot of fun,4,"Wow, I am still having fun driving this beast after one year.  I own a 5.7 hemi limited all equipped except for the NAV.  I believed that all reviews are pretty accurate. However, I will comment on Canadian winter driving with lot of snows, freezing rains, icy conditions the driving is OK with the 20' tires but would strongly recommend winter tires but hard to find.  This is my 1st year with winter tires and nothing can stop me.  The 4 wheel drives is extremely precise and can not feel anything when all wheels are slipping.  My wife, kids and I feel extremely safe in the vehicle.  "

chrysler,aspen,2007,tjkenny, 02/10/2007,Aspen 4WD with Hemi,5,Couldn't care less about the Durango and was apprehensive to consider the ASPEN because I thought it was a Durango derivative.  Well I was wrong! The ASPEN is a new design that is very well executed.  Good fit & finish with nice responsive but comfortable handling.  Bought the Limited with Hemi and all options.  This car rocks!
chrysler,aspen,2007,Princeton, NJ,Home Run,4,"I transitioned to Chrysler several years ago via several company cars and manufacturers failed to live up to the design and quality I was experiencing with Chrysler. Well, once again Chrysler has done it! I have the 28J package in the Pearl Black and have already received several positive comments about the look. It drives flawlessly and there is plenty of room to fit my 6'5"" frame along with the rest of the family. The interior design is quality, leaps and bounds above the competition in addition to the 20 inch wheels along with Hemi put the Escalade, Navigator, and Denali series to shame. Chrylser needs to advertise more and get the word out they have a winner!"

WE purchased this vehicle because of its looks and because we have not seen to many of this car.The people that think that the aspen is a redesigned Durango need to look twice. The only similarity is the platform that both sit on.
chrysler,aspen,2007,Anthony, 09/30/2007,Aspen 4WD (non-hemi model),4,"This is not a Dodge Durango- from the wood grain steering wheel to the leather heated 1st/2nd row seats you know this is from the flagship brand and not the step child Durango. Chrysler did an excellent job, quiet roomy interior, all the amenities, the back up sensor works great and is a must on a vehicle this size. Plus with 0% financing and lifetime warranty, there was no choice but to buy this!"
chrysler,aspen,2007,Data Diva, 05/31/2007,Best Kept Secret,4,"I bought this SUV after falling in love with one that my sister has. It is worth a test-drive so that you can erase the stereotypes about Chrysler/Dodge. Both the exterior and interior are superb, and it seems as if they have practical engineers on the job who designed the car for everyday cost-consciuos people who want an SUV to envy! The features in the Aspen make it worth way more than its cost. The features rival those of pricier car-makers but with a no-frills price. As a VP in marketing, I believe the Aspen was created to boost Chrysler's SUV appeal, so they put all these top features as a repositioning campaign and more folks need to discover the secret."
chrysler,aspen,2007,Doc, 09/12/2007,Best SUV for money,4,"From the very first moment you can feel the comfort and ease of handling. It almost drives itself, with a smooth ride and fast response. After driving it on a trip, how could you ever consider driving anything else.  It's a keeper for me and when I am ready for a new vehicle it will be on the top of my list.  Chrysler you did it again, great job as always."
chrysler,aspen,2007,Aspen, 09/21/2007,Chrysler knows America,4,"This is not a pretend SUV, I have owned SUV's for 15 years and watched them become watered-down, shadows of themselves.  In '02 got a new Suburban loved it, but GM has done nothing significant with style or powerplant.  Chrysler has shown they can combine rugged performance and styling to come up with a vehicle that performs and is appealing to the eye.  GM and Ford have allowed their large SUV's to become oafish by comparison.  Their design teams just do not get it in my opinion.  Europe and Japan aren't making anything comparable for under $70k."
chrysler,aspen,2007,Houston Midtown, 06/06/2007,Duly Impressed,5,Love the power. Starts very quickly. Brakes were a little soft at the beginning until I backed down a hill at 10 mph and applied the brakes. Sound system is awesome. Drives very tight and responsive.
chrysler,aspen,2007,MSolcz, 08/08/2007,Traded A BMW X5 for this vehicle,4,"Traded up in the right direction. This vehicle is a far cry from the Import.

This truck rocks. Drives as smooth as an ocean breeze. Picks up like a rocket and is better on highway gas than my 4 cyl car was! Its not as good city but not bad either. Plenty of room and better features than some of the supposedly ""top of the line"" trucks. Chrysler has truly outdone themselves on this one! People are sleeping on this truck but that's okay. I dont mind being the only head turner in town "
chrysler,aspen,2007,goldenboy, 10/15/2007,An improvement over yhe Durango.,4,"The 5.7 engine is the engine of choice. I had the 4.7 engine in my 2005 Durango and it use to be weak on hi-way passing power,  4 cylinder engine cars would smoke me. Everything about this suv is premium, a steal loaded with all options, and still 20 grand less than Escalade(66,000). I can't believe the amount of  compliments I get on it."
chrysler,aspen,2007,aspenlover, 10/20/2007,Chrysler has a head-turning hit,4,This is my second Hemi (1st was Dodge RAM truck which I also loved) and my 1st SUV. The Aspen is a total headturner.  I constantly get asked about it. Love the ride and the J package rocks with the black metallic paint and leather interior.  My husband can't stop raving about how comfortable the vehicle is and he does a lot of driving. Although he has to ask permission to drive my Aspen!  Ordered all the options except DVD entertainment pkg. LED interior lights are great also.
chrysler,aspen,2007,Fatboy, 04/10/2019,Solid,4,"Got this Vehicle used with about 67K on it.  It has been reliable vehicle for the most part.  Gets about 20mpg Hwy  13 mixed.  Roomy enough for three kids and decent trunk space.  Interior is very plain and not enough storage or cup holders.  Instruments are well laid out.  Overall, I am very satisfied with this vehicle and I wish Chrysler still produced it as I would love another as I now have about 167K on the vehicle."

Even though it looks a little like a Durango....I get asked all the time how I like it and told that it sure is a beautiful vehicle. As a side point..a Lexus backed into the bumper, my damage was 800.00 his was 4,000.00. I'd say it's pretty sturdy. To bad the Lexus didn't have rear sensors like my Aspen does.

Bottom line, it's comfy, stylish, responsive, quick and only costs around 32K, as we all know, you can't get an Acura for that, as if I'd want one after this gem! If you pass this up, go back to Uranus or whatever other planet that is in the deep cold of overcharging for the same vehicle that is everywhere, just slightly ""Emblemed"". I love it!"
chrysler,aspen,2007,Lee, 12/06/2007,Better than most thought,4,"To set the record straight, I own a 5.7 HEMI Limited. I've driven most all the SUV's in its class and this one feels the lightest due to its power. The fit-and-finish comments I am reading just aren't true; the Chrysler interioir is on par with what you will find on the market. The fold-up second row seats are the easiest to use for my small wife.....use one hand and 2 clicks. My Jeep Commander, in contrast, is much harder. Styling is hit or miss but everyone looks at it and asks us about it because they have never seen one before and they all comment on how pretty it is. Bottomline is that it hauls, hauls all 4 of my daughters, wife loves the bells/whistles.....great buy!"
chrysler,aspen,2007,ORVISMAN, 03/26/2008,Love it!,4,"Got the Hemi (MDS)... We love this vehicle. Does everything expected, well. Drives, handles, hauls... no complaints other than the gas mileage.  But what large SUV gets good gas mileage.  Very happy with this buy!"
chrysler,aspen,2007,Vonna, 04/18/2008,Stylish,4,Got a great deal through warehouse club.  Feel as though I have a vehicle as good or better looking than the majority of the SUVs only I paid much less.  I get comments all the time on how nice the SUV looks.  Roomy enough to haul just about anything and very comfortably seats people even in the third row.
chrysler,aspen,2007,Dave, 05/23/2008,Great Vehicle Overall,4,"We bought a used 07, All options, Hemi, Nav, Remote Start, everything.  I bought it in Atlanta, GA I live in Roanoke, VA. Trip home was good. 455 miles and got 21.2 mpg on the Hemi MDS engine.  No complaints on gas.  A vehicle this size! Thats good. It could have been better I suppose but I was on and off the gas, since I had a new toy! It has a smooth ride, very quiet. The Hemi climbs the mountains effortlessly.  I was going 80 mph up the mountains at only 2000 rpm. It gets a lot of looks.  The 20 chromes really set it off.  The third row seat access is by far the easiest out there.  The lever on the second row seat is so simple. Get the Hemi with MDS. No use for the Flex fuel, No 85oc here."
chrysler,aspen,2007,Jake, 05/29/2008,First SUV,4,"Bought this as a left-over new 2007 after looking at a Pacifica, and glad that this is what I chose.  Highway miles with the 5.7 Hemi are between 21 and 23 MPG.  Keeping the tach under 2000 rpm helps a lot.  Towing is no problem recently towed a 6 x 12 U-Haul trailer loaded and still got 14 mpg.  Towing a boat is like it isn't there.  Comfort is great, the  ride and handling are excellent.   Fit and finish are excellent.  Even with gas going through the roof, I don't see me trading down."

chrysler,aspen,2007,Bill, 05/07/2019,This is a big luxury SUV,5,"I own an offshore power boat and wanted something that could pull it on trips better then my Jeep Grand Cherokee. No comparison between the 2 SUV's. I have the 5.7 HEMI which is about 100 horsepower over the 4.7 V-8 and still get about 1 mpg more. I guess it doesn't have to work as hard or just a better design. This is a heavy duty SUV with a lot of bells and whistles. I don't use the sunroof much. There are too many added features to list on this SUV. I'm very impressed with the room and comfort that 8 adults can ride very comfortable. The dual vented and ease of sitting anyplace. The rear bumper sensors are a good feature and automatic rear hatch. The storage behind the rear seat is okay, but not huge. The second and third row seats fold easily or split in any configuration. Driving this makes a trip very comfortable with a long list of features and I don't need to push down on the gas pedal much for it to accelerate and leave traffic behind as I watch the tachometer, which means the engine has a lot more if needed. This SUV is a beast, but handles like a car. It has excellent acceleration and braking which is very impressive for a large SUV. You feel very secure if in an accident because everyone in this vehicle would survive as it's built much stronger then other SUV's or any car. This vehicle is unmatched in towing from everything else I have used. A good look under this vehicle will surprise you. I have a little  over100K on this now and feel it should be good for at least 500K miles.
Vehicle details won't let me update to correct engine as I have the Hemi, not the 4.7L

chrysler,aspen,2007,Danielle, 01/30/2020,This baby has comfort and style!,5,I love my Aspen it has plenty of room and it is a comfortable ride. Literally the only complaint I would have about this vehicle is the gas on average I get about 14 mile to the gallon. But overall I have had my vehicle for going on 2 years and the maintenance on it has been minimal. Basically only have worried about oil changes and tire rotations. I would highly recommend this vehicle if you are wanting a spacious and comfortable ride. 
chrysler,aspen,2007,skii, 01/18/2008,Great family buy!,4,"This started out as a vehicle for the wife and kids, but I find myself behind the wheel more & more. Great look, feel, and handling for the price! Even the base model demands respect!"
chrysler,aspen,2007,jason, 11/09/2007,Sweet,4,"My wife and I just bought the Aspen. This thing rocks. We got the HEMI, DVD, NAV, leather heated seats and so on. We bought this as a lease return and noticed the fuel is a little poor, but it is a big suv with lots of power. Everyone who has seen it has loved the interior and the exterior as well. Mention it has a HEMI and they say wow. The gas mileage is about 16 mpg in rush hour traffic, not to bad."
chrysler,aspen,2007,CT, 05/03/2008,More for Less,4,One of these loaded is as nice as any luxury SUV on the market and costs thousands less. Great buy and have never been happier with a vehicle.
chrysler,aspen,2007,chryslersuks, 09/28/2012,Epic Fail om Customer Satisfaction,1,"Long story short, We paid Cash for a new 2007 Aspen and had issues from the first year with the air cond. ""freezing up"" on us when we drove over 2 hours. We use this vehicle for business travel. After several ( more than 3) attempts to correct the issue we filed under FL lemon law and sent letter in to Chrysler Corp. and they argued that the timeline was an issue. I fought and fought with over 5 ""case mgrs."" and 3 supervisors about the issues we have with the car for over the past six months in 2012. I only asked for a permanent solution, but after over 6 mechanics and 3 different dealerships, they just want us to keep going back to the dealer to try to fig. it out. To no solution, we are..."
chrysler,aspen,2007,JimM, 04/02/2008,Lemon,3,This is an excellent SUV for the Price. The limited has all the features other similar SUVs have at a lower cost. Unfortunately the vehicle has been in the service department 4 times because the engine malfunction light comes on and causes the vehicle to have drivability issues. I have been to 2 different dealerships and nobody can find the cause of the issue which has caused a serious safety issue. Be cautious about buying this new model
chrysler,aspen,2007,It's American Made!, 04/25/2008,Made in the USA,4,"This is a great SUV. My first was a Ford Explorer. I loved it. However when switching between the two for the past 9 months showed me what a great ride the Aspen is. Very smooth. Didn't buy it for the mpg... But, it isn't very good. IF you drive really slow, even on highway, 20 mpg is best. If you have hills, wind, to pass, etc the mpg drops to 16 quick..."
chrysler,aspen,2008,IOJ, 10/14/2010,Fantastic SUV!,5,"We've had this vehicle for almost 2 years now and I have to say that is CERTAINLY the best SUV we have ever had! We have had Durangos in the past-- although nice they do not compare to the Aspen--especially in looks!  The Aspen's ride is incredibly smooth!  These vehicles do EXTREMELY well on snow and ice! We put 37K miles on our Aspen, and it has never had 1 problem of any kind. We have had Nissan Armadas in the past which only get 16- 17mpg on the highway whereas the Aspen gets 20 mpg. With the towing capacity and luxury you get for such a low price, I would definitely recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a completely reliable, luxurious, and high quality SUV for a reasonable price."
chrysler,aspen,2008,Greg, 05/18/2016,"8 years, 85k miles, 0 problems",5,"After eight years and 85k miles, I've not had a single problem with my Aspen. It has not a squeak or rattle, and the engine still runs without a trace of vibration. The interior still cleans up like new after detailing even after eight years of kid/dog abuse. Our dog goes on the leather seats a lot and her nails haven't so much as scratched the leather. My factory brake pads lasted past 60k miles. The 5.7 Hemi doesn't exactly sip fuel, but it sure does tow when needed. Other than seeing the trailer in the rear view mirror, I can hardly tell I'm towing at all. Off road handling has been good on mountain dirt roads and beach sands. 

Other than scheduled maintenance and battery changes, I've not had to shell out a dime's worth of maintenance for the Aspen. AC is still as strong as ever; no seals, gaskets, belts or hoses have needed replacing; no degradation from wear and tear yet other than cosmetic items. As the original owner with a lifetime power train warranty, I don't see much incentive to replace the Aspen any time soon.
"
chrysler,aspen,2008,Jim Chalon, 10/25/2010,Completely Fantastic SUV-already own 3!,5,"I bought my first Aspen in 2008 brand new.  So far I've driven it 40k and it has NEVER had any problems of any kind!  After owning it for 2 years I bought 2 more.  The ride is extremely quiet and smooth and seats are comfortable. Leather interior is VERY high quality. Gas mileage is great at 22 mpg on the highway.  This vehicle does VERY, VERY well on snow and ice.  I tow a large boat and haul 6-7 adults with it regularly.  Handling is SUPERB!  When I found out they were going to be discontinued, I bought 2 more.  All 3 have never had any problems.  I would certainly recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a reasonably priced, large, high quality, luxury SUV."

updated 4.12.2017 by Tracy Brown........well, readers,  I still own my Chrysler Aspen Limited 5.7L Hemi RWD.........and I like it more today than before my last review..........I probably have the last Aspen Standing..........Chrysler put a gazzillion dollars into the Dorango Makeover, and they will never but never re-coup that money on the DOGG of a  Dorango  !!!!  I would have, had I been Chrysler, never badged this SUV the Aspen.........I would have dumped the dorango brand, and re-upted the badge of the long time ago, Chrysler luxo finned crusier the "" Imperial ""  its was pure luxary..........and I would have marketed this (ASPEN)  as the Imperial, and aimed it directly at the GM's  Caddy Esclade, and the Ford Lincoln Navigator, and brought back the rivarly of the ""Big 3""  auto makers from the 1960's and 1970's......there have only been two men in the automotive business ever, that were geniuss,   Mr. Henry Ford and the great Lee Iococa !!!!   everybody since those two men,  and even up to this date.........could not walk and chew gum at the same time........ok ok put the tomatos you are about to throw at me down please .......... I am only talking about domistice car makers.........gezzzz  give a guy a break.

10.13.2017 update..........I was right with this review then, and the review stands firm of/for my Chrysler SUV is even more worthy of high praise today.......and I have the support of the worlds finest and most all around knowledgable mechanic...............because my daddy told me way back when..........son, get yourself a good heart specialist, and a great mechanic..............words of wisdom for the ages for any car guy.............lol    
Tracy Brown
and on to a 10.13.2018 update........well I am still right about the above review.......however Mr. Chrysler threw me a curve......on the lifetime warranty.........they decided not to send me the manditory 5 year renewal notice to have my aspen inspected by the dealership..........and so my warranty will not be renewed by chrysler........the little back stabbing lieing cheating theiving pricks.......and then there is the totally negative bias from the slimy little creepy people at carfax, a few key strokes from those ignorate num nuts cost me $4000 in equity on a $150 dollar insurance claim from a parking lot incident with my aspen, while I was in the store shopping..........man o man do I hate carfax for sure they made this tiny tiny little incident sound like a huge roll over 6 times at a nascar race !!!!!  but, I'm good to go for another few years, but I will never but never when the time comes,  ever purchase another chrysler product !  a company who cheats its customers, just for the fun of it, any maybe a couple of dollars and maybe not, but that company Chrysler does not earn loyalty from me, and should not from you either.
tracy brown
well its 4/15/2020 and time to again to update my previous reviews, by adding that I still own it, I still use it as my daily driver, I still love it ,  its big, fast, and beautiful, and dependable, reliable, and drives like a brand new luxo cruiser, and still looks like fresh 2020 transportation just off the detroit assembly line........ 87003 miles and runs like top and purrs like a kitten until you open it up, then you get to power and the roar of the big cat...........I love it then and I love it now.........
tracy brown 
well its 10.15.2020 and time to update you
 with my continuing review and remarks........it was time for a little touch-up paint on the ol girl, but wouldn't you know it the jerrrks at chrysler presented me with another curve ball to chase around ..........lol  the early built Aspens have one paint code for my cognac pearl coat (red/maroon) and the later built SUV's have a different paint code no body seems to know what is what everybody uses the later code thinking that is it only because its the only paint code listed however the color is different so you have to literally become a paint detective to find the correct paint color paint code if you own a early model painted Aspen.......I love my truck and absolutely hate the company that built it, and if you own one of these truly great vehicles then you know exactly what I am talking about.......your pal, tracy

chrysler,aspen,2008,cvh, 02/18/2009,Great truck for the money!,4,"When I first saw the Aspen, I had no idea what kind of truck it was.  Chrysler does not advertise it, but am I glad I found it! We purchased a limited 5.7L Hemi and couldn't be happier with the performance.  Compared to the Chevrolet trucks, you get a lot of nice extra features for the money! We love the heated leather seats, navigation system, rear DVD, Sirius radio, and roomy third row seats. Gas mileage not great, but we didn't expect it to be. The ride is smooth and quiet and the pick-up is outstanding. We previously owned a Chevrolet truck and I would never buy another one after finding the Aspen. It's a great buy!"
chrysler,aspen,2008,Adamsafe, 12/09/2008,2008 Aspen,3,"Replaced a Tahoe with this. Solid vehicle, but its not a Tahoe.  Transmission not as smooth as GM. Seat construct OK. Ride is nice, power is there, but lags due to transmission.  Nice features, interior. Overall, good value for the price, especially in comparison to Tahoe."
chrysler,aspen,2008,bcarefull, 01/02/2009,Nothing but trouble,2,I have had nothing but trouble since I bought my Aspen. Lots of electrical problems. Still have equipment that's not working. The dealer I bought it from still can't get it fixed. I have two freinds with Aspens both not happy. I tried to trade it in and the dealer told me I would lose more than 15 thousand than I payed just months ago. Should have bought a import.
chrysler,aspen,2008,popsicle, 06/07/2009,Super Vehicle,4,"So far, so good. This is an incredible SUV. It has everything and more that we were looking for in an SUV. It is roomier, and the best ride available. It was very reasonably priced and we loved it from the minute we looked at it. It drove and rode so much smoother than any of the other SUV's we test drove, that we just kept going back to it. This one is totally loaded with all of the extra features - I know I will love it!!"
chrysler,aspen,2008,Ms. Frugal, 05/28/2008,Nice SUV but read this before you buy?,4,"I really do like my 2008 Aspen but I wish I would have noticed a few things before I purchased it. #1, the sunroof does not go all the way back as in flush. Therefore, it causes a bit of noise that will require a wind deflector. #2, The Antenna, I don't know how I missed this but being as though none of my past models had it, it just slipped by. But, why in 2008 are there still visible antenna's? It's really annoying going through a car wash! #3, Even though it is an SUV, it SUCKS gas like crazy. I did get the Hemi engine but I don't stomp on the pedal at all. A full tank of gas gets you about 350-375 miles, so I guess it's not to bad but don't forget the 5.7 engine requires 89 octane gas!!!"
chrysler,aspen,2008,nancy, 07/29/2008,Love it!,4,"My husband bought the ASPEN for our 13th wedding anniversary, we went to trade our Town & Country minivan and my eyes caught this beautiful SUV, I said I want that one. I had never seen it before.  Mine is cool vanilla, the ext is fancy and the interior is comfortable. I feel so protected my I ride it.  I spent about $70 a week on gas.  How about yours?"
chrysler,aspen,2008,NewGuy, 12/31/2008,Not too shabby,3,"This is a fantastic vehicle for families. It has tons of interior room, rides very smooth, has gobs of power with the Hemi engine, and the MyGig system coupled with navigation and DVD is exceptional. The voice commands in this vehicle are the easiest to use of any I've seen (several)."
chrysler,aspen,2008,Big Ski, 01/03/2009,Good but not great!,3,"Let me first say that I enjoy my car. Not sorry that I leased it.  I'm 12 months into a 36 month lease but I know that I won't buy once lease is over. I previously owned a Durango so the Aspen was a logical progression in staying with Chrysler. I love the luxury of the Aspen over the Durango (lots of cheap plastic in Durango) but the Aspen is not as nice to drive as the Durango.  For some reason my Aspen feels sluggish at times. It also doesn't seen to handle as well as Durango. Aspen's looks and standard equipment are great for the money. I've gotten more for my lease dollar than I would have with Tahoe, Armada, etc.  But I'll probably look at different SUVs once lease is over."
chrysler,aspen,2008,Louie, 03/09/2010,Good for the money,4,"We bought our Aspen used with the 4.7 liter engine and so far has been impressed with the vehicle. The only problem we had is with the door panels leather coming unglued but they were replaced under the warranty. On a trip from Louisiana to Connecticut we Average 24 miles a gallon at 70 with 5 grown ups and luggage, that was very impressive. It was the best price vehicle in its class ,the third row seat can fit grown persons for long trips and the vehicle itself it not overly huge. Mechanically so far has been solid no problems."
chrysler,aspen,2008,rakcmei, 10/23/2008,Love My Leftovers,4,"Leftover '08! Love this thing. Rides so smooth. Powerful but not too big. I've only had it a few weeks, but thrilled with it. Took a couple of long-ish trips and kids were very comfortable in the back 2 rows. Have an issue with the aluminum clad wheels clunking, but there is a TSB coming out for it."
chrysler,aspen,2008,weemax, 04/29/2009,run dont walk,2,We bought our Aspen in Nov at a dealership 600km from where we live. During the first 100km we noticed a very anoying humming / virbration noise coming at highway speeds.  It has progressed to the issue happening all the time.  this truck has been in the shop for over 50 days and now chrysler is advising it is a known issue.  We are in litigation for a FULL BUYBACK.  stability on the SUV is very poor and now with the over extensive work done I'm sure the integrity of the vehicle has been compromised.  The latest noise since it's last return from the shop )kept for 30 days!!) is a very loud clunking sound from the rear end.  Like I titled this review RUN dont walk away from this vehicle
chrysler,aspen,2008,Unhappy customer, 01/11/2010,"Nice to look at, frustrating to drive",3,"I bought a 2008 brand new after trading in my 2001 Dodge Durango, which was bought new. I was told the Aspen was a step up. WRONG. At 22k miles it started making this loud churning/humming noise. Dealer made me buy new tires. Didn't resolve the issue. They have replaced everything that rotates and spins from drive shaft, trainy, front end, rear end .. now the steering wheel vibrates.  I have never had as many issues with a vehicle than I have with this. My Durango was in the shop once for a recall. I wish I had that SUV back! "
chrysler,aspen,2008,me, 06/07/2010,Never Again,3,We traded in a Jeep Liberty for this Aspen and it is great as long as you do not hit any bumps.  It has been in the shop 4 times for the same issue.  It totally loses control going over bumps in the road. Barely missed a person on the sidewalk due to the vehicle bouncing so badly after hitting a manhole cover in the road. Going to have all the shocks replaced tomorrow (AGAIN) to see if it resolves the issue.
chrysler,aspen,2008,Aspen Owner, 10/07/2008,"Functional, good value vehicle",4,"Purchased my Aspen in September 2008.  So far it has been enjoyable to drive.  The best thing about the Aspen is that it is a functional car.  I have the second row bench seating (for child's seat).  Also, the third row folding down and stowing is a nice option.  Other similar size vehicles either don't have a third row or you have to physically remove the seats and store them somewhere else.  I got the limited signature series(J pkg) with the 5.7 L Hemi.  Gas mileage was to be expected about 14 - 15 mpg.  The interior is great with MyGig, Navigation, DVD player and rear camera.  To purchase the same vehicle from another manufacturer would probably have cost me $10K more.  Good car overall."
chrysler,aspen,2008,Matt, 11/10/2008,Chrysler Aspen Limited Fully Loaded,4,"I leased my Aspen with every available option it could come with. It is a real head turner in the HD Silver Metallic paint and 20inch rims. It would be better if the rims were chrome (Plastic Caps) but hard to notice to the untrained eye. No complaints. Only one problem, and I see nobody else in the reviews taliking about it. Between 67mph and 74mph there is a whole body vibration which the dealer and Chrysler engineering cannot fix. They have replaced every moving part outside of the engine itself including all rims, tires, driveshafts, manifolds, axles, etcetcetc. Love the truck, but they admit it is a lemon law vehicle. "
chrysler,aspen,2008,coolride, 02/05/2009,cool to drive,4,Excellent SUV to drive.  Great value and fuel economy is better than expected.  Full tank gets you more than 500 miles.  
chrysler,aspen,2008,Don, 02/24/2009,Very Nice SUV,4,"I am 6ft 7 300lb man with a wife and 4 chidren. I wanted a big vehicle that I could get in without breaking my neck and if I hit a bump not knock myself out. I test drove  5 other big SUVs. The only other SUV I could fit in was Ford Expedition and it was OK but it didn't do anything for me so I kept looking. My wife saw an Aspen at a dealership and asked if I would test drive it so I did and I purchased it the next day. I got the fully loaded limited. We love it. I don't have a heavy foot so when I drive I can get in the city 17mpg, on  the hwy going 70 mph got 25 mpg. I think that is great for a big SUV. The Aspen is as good or better than SUVs that are a little higher in price. "

chrysler,aspen,2008,tnvol, 01/21/2008,"Way better than Tahoe, or Expedition",4,"Got the 2008, with the hemi variable engine displacement engine. Extremely smooth ride, excellent handling on highway and in city driving. Not burdened with a lot of useless luxury items, but is loaded with very functional and fun stuff. Carried 4 adults and 2 kids  very comfortably. Gas mileage is what you would expect for a vehicle of this type. Love it and would recommend it highly. "
chrysler,aspen,2008,RJS, 08/20/2009,Excellent Value,4,The Aspen is a very smooth ride and very quite.  This makes listening to the Sirius Satellite Radio even more enjoyable!  To me the interior is more like a high end SUV.  The plastic on the outside however gives this away.  I am very happy and do not agree with the editorial.  The second seat leg room is fair but the fold down seats in second roll makes more third row leg room. 
chrysler,aspen,2008,pg, 05/20/2008,Aspen Signature Series,4,"Got the 2008, love it, love it, love it.  I traded in an explorer (which I thought I loved). Wow, what a wonderful suv.  I bought the signature series (w/all the bells/whistles).  Gorgeous two tone leather.  I live out in the country and drive about 100 miles a day...what a comfortable ride.  The radio, mp3 player, back up camera--all nice.  the room for the kids in the back (big and roomy-no one touches anyone). The gas is what I expected (avg 16.3 mpg)  Of course I would love better gas (but for what I am getting, I can live w/the gas price).  Would recommend to anyone.  This SUV rocks. "
chrysler,aspen,2008,its ok, 04/07/2010,Not a bad truck just needs better gas mileage,2,Eats up gas. Bad shakes at about 68 to 75. Some come with no foot boards.

chrysler,aspen,2008,MarkE, 05/04/2009,Aspen Worth the Money,4,"In preparation for the birth of our first child, we researched every make and model possible to best fit our key needs.  The Aspen gave the best ride and overall cost-effective features of any large SUV under $40k.  A comparably equipped Tahoe or Expedition would have been thousands more.  With a little over a year and 12k miles into the purchase, I have no regrets and would buy one again.    "
chrysler,aspen,2008,MD Cain, 06/01/2008,Great SUV,4,"Got it in Light Sandstone and it looks awesome. Don't understand all the people who worship at the alter of "" all Japanese Brands are great and all American Brands are junk ."" We had a 2004 Durango and never had a minute's trouble with it. Like some of the other posters I don't understand why Chrysler doesn't promote it more. You see a lot of commercials about Ford's voice recognition system but the My Gig unit blows that away and they never promote it! I know these vehicles are not selling well due to high gas prices but the upside for us is we got it for $10,300 off of MSRP. It ended up costing less than our Durango did 4 years ago which had way less features. Great vehicle."
chrysler,aspen,2008,kaptain, 06/03/2008,Great!!,4,I purchased the signature series 2008 with a Hemi. I love it! I also own a Concorde and the gas mileage isn't that much of a difference but the space is! Rides great and handles really well.

chrysler,aspen,2008,James P., 07/06/2008,I Love My Aspen,4,This is a great SUV. Lots of interior room and a very comfortable ride.It has a very upscale exterior design and I love the chrome accents. Would highly recommend the 28J package. I have gotten 17.5 mpg so far with still less than 1000 miles driven.
chrysler,aspen,2008,Keli, 07/22/2008,2 month old owner,4,"We looked for almost a year before we decided on my Aspen, now I'm wishing I waited for the hybrid. So far my Aspen has needed to go in to the shop more times then a new SUV should. MyGig has locked up with the UConnect so the phone nor any sound would work. My sunroof is leaking & yes I have the DVD player in the back just behind the leaking sunroof. There is this high pitch noise that comes from the AC/Heater when its on higher then 2 that drives me crazy due to ear trouble. RE:gas,not sure what to say because the dealer keeps saying just wait till you have over 3000 miles it will get better. This weekend it needed a jump to get start? Don't get me wrong I do love it just wonder if lemon?"
chrysler,aspen,2008,Amy, 09/08/2008,"Beautiful SUV, but options DO NOT WORK!",3,"This vehicle is very fun to drive, however I have had mine in and out of the shop 30 days in the past 6 months due to electrical problems with the electronic options. The DVD player which has been replaced 3 different times is still not fixed, so I need take it back to the shop once again. I definitely think mine is a LEMON! "
chrysler,aspen,2008,aol, 09/15/2008,looking good,5,So nice to drive and not pass your car a trillion times on the road.  What an expensive looking car.  Never go anywhere without receiving a compliment.  Very roomy but not too big.  A great package deal of optional features.  Chrysler don't advertise it very much. But it will become popular by sight when it arrives in person any place.  Many people stated they heard about it but never saw it before.

I am IN LOVE with this truck.  I've had 4 back surgeries and just chucked my Toyota Sienna XLE.  This is my first American car in 15 years and I'm trilled.  Took a LONG ride today and it was so comfortable and quiet.  Loved the heated leather seats on my low back.  Even with the 20"" beefy tires, it just floated.  No road noise to speak of.  The power lift gate is super, remote start, MyGig Alpine is fantastic, even came with 12 mos. free Sirius.  Listed for $42K and paid $29,400 spankin' new.  It was a steal! I can pay for a lot of gas with the money saved from Lexus or Caddy! THRILLED"
chrysler,aspen,2008,jmcolosimo, 12/26/2007,Well kept secret,4,"Chrysler doesn't advertise this vehicle as it should.  This is a fine, quality SUV especially if you buy it with the 28j package.  With this package, the Aspen is far and away the best bargain...when compared with Toyota, Ford, or the GMC products of like kind. This vehicle is way beyond the Durango.  It's quality is as good, if not better, than the aforementioned SUV's, but about 8-10k less."
chrysler,aspen,2008,bak, 01/06/2008,Nice Truck,4,"I have been a big fan of Edmunds for a long time- but I have to disagree here. I have a 2005 Durango and recently purchased a 08 Aspen (because we enjoy the Durango so much).  While I agree that the trucks look very similar there is a huge difference inside the two vehicles. Even though they are similarly equipped, it is obvious that they went to great lengths to differentiate the two vehicles. The gas mileage is worse even with the same engine (hopefully because its new).  "
chrysler,aspen,2008,shemadeitinaz, 01/13/2008,You won't be disappointed,5,Chrysler won't let you down with this one either.  I have been out looking at SUV's for over six months and overall with interior and exterior features along with the Hemi under the hood I couldn't pass this one up for the what you get for your money.  I am not trying so seet 7 adults so the kids have plenty of room and are easily distracted by the DVD system anyway.  Definilety go with the 28J package there just isn't anything left on the wish list that isn't covered.
chrysler,aspen,2008,Mrs.Thais, 02/07/2008,I love My Aspen,4,I traded in my 06 Pathfinder for my Aspen and I have to say that I love my car. When I drive it just glides along the road and parking has always been a challange for me and now with my back up camera its a cinch! The Aspen is roomy and luxury to max for the money . As for the gas mileage its great. If you're going to complain about gas then a SUV isn't for you. Not only is it a fun car with the ability to just plug in your I- pod or download some personal pictures but it's a classy car and I agree that this is one of Chrysler's best kept secret. 
chrysler,aspen,2008,agist, 02/26/2008,Great Vehicle.,4,"I just purchased this vehicle and am very pleased so far.  I have recently owned  Lexus and Nissan vehicles(both cars and trucks).  This truck makes me wonder why I ever payed the premium price of owning the other vehicles! This thing is great, quiet and smooth ride. A ton of features for the money and really quick. I got the one with the Hemi, Nav, My Gig etc. Anyone looking for a great vehicle at a great price, this is the one! Great job Chrysler!   "
chrysler,aspen,2008,Bobby Price, 03/14/2008,What a super ride,4,"I have owned 4 cadillacs, 2 chevrolets, 5 chryslers, 1 pickup, and now my second suv.  This 2008 Aspen is by far the finest ride I have ever owned.  I would recommend this Signature Series to everyone.  Yes, a little rough on the pocketbook for gas mileage, but it's worth the sacrifice for the comfort and the ride. This ride makes everyone stop and take a second look!"
chrysler,aspen,2008,MOPAR1, 12/07/2007,Impressive,5,"This is the only SUV I have ever owned that gets better and better each and every time I drive it.  The HEMI engine has power to spare. Consider the 20"" wheel group as it seems to have a much smoother ride and suspension. Luxurious, sharp & very inexpensive to lease for a 45K vehicle."
chrysler,aspen,2008,Nickie, 04/12/2008,Love the Aspen,4,"I love the ride it looks great, has everything you could possibly need in a vehicle for about $10,000 less than other SUV's. I got the one with the hemi to pull a travel trailer. Top of the line w/o 4 wheel drive msrp was $42,500 can't beat that."
chrysler,aspen,2008,Brian, 04/14/2008,Aspen Limited,3,I have owned a number of Dodge/Chrysler products. I really like the Aspen. The MyGIG Nav system is great. The Hemi is strong and overall he looks are outstanding.
chrysler,aspen,2008,ESA, 04/16/2008,Nice Ride!,4,"Replaced my 300C with the Aspen.Definitely a better fit for a family who doesn't want to go minivan crazy! Seats adults and kids comfortably and makes its presence known on the road. Although the Aspen comes with some pretty cool standard features, only adding minor upgrades has been hard to deal with after the purchase (Nav. and entertainment system would have made this a nicer buy). Chrysler should also think about moving the body style further away from the Durango..I know as an Aspen owner I get a little peeved when people say, ""oh, you went and got the Durango?"" - NO! Overall, it's a sweet ride. "
chrysler,aspen,2008,Linda, 04/21/2008,Chrysler's Best Kept Secret,4,"After 6 months of researching all of the crossovers, I stumbled upon this great find.  My previous car was an Expedition; rode like a truck.  This is a smooth, comfortable, classy vehicle.  All the bells and whistles you can ask for and absolutely affordable.  Plenty of leg/head room for adults; comfort measures for the kids.  Navigation system and media center is a great perk!  Able to download CD's to hard drive and eliminate clutter in the car.  Looking forward to taking it on long trips!"
chrysler,aspen,2008,jan, 04/22/2008,Best SUV on the road,4,"This is the perfect SUV.  I have the j package with the hemi, 20' wheels and all the extras.  It fits all of us with comfort and ease. One of us is 6'5' one 5'11' and one jumbo sized. I got the cool vanilla exterior color an it looks beautiful.  I love the heated seats, back up camera, and gig touch screen radio and gps."

Saw the 2008 in the dealership when in for first service in April, 08  Liked it because of enhanced features on most options.  Thought I'd trade out and knew I'd get hammered on the trade.  I didn't expect to get slaughtered.   Dealer quoted me a trade value of $23,500, or 12,500 less than purchase price 3 months earlier, and was only willing to cut sticker price on 08 by $4,000.  When people realize that these pigs not only guzzle gas, but they'll guzzle your equity, we wont be seeing many more. "

chrysler,aspen,2008,5.7 Hemi, 01/02/2009,Best SUV on the market.,5,"I purchased this 5.7 limited Cool Vanilla Aspen with every option but tow package. I got it used with 35k miles. It has nav, dvd, rear heated seats, flat folding 3rd row seating. 20"" rims, The car is beautiful and comfortable. After 35K the car runs and drives perfect. My mpg have been 16 city, and according to the computer 23+ ave. hwy. When I filled it up I got 19+ I think this is excelent for a ture 4x4 high and low and full time 4x4 options. I paid 23800 + 1800 full wrap life time warrenty and 1000 for gap. So I got a great deal. There is not a car with all the options and saftey out there. This truck rocks."

Best SUV for the money and I haven't found a flaw yet - other than the gas mileage, but I knew how bad that was going in and was willing to make the sacrifice. It wasn't any better than the compact 05 SUV I was driving, but it was certainly better than some of the other full size models I was shopping for. "
chrysler,aspen,2009,Shandor Weiss, 09/11/2015,Best body on frame SUV for the money,5,"I absolutely love my 09 Aspen with the 5.7L gas hemi engine. AWD, J package, 20"" wheels. It's beautiful to look at, to sit in and to drive. Bought it used with 72K miles. This is a real SUV although it looks like a luxury car. I live in the mountains of Oregon down a long winding gravel road,  and have to go over a 4300 foot pass on I-5. It handles like a dream, especially after getting new and better shocks and tires. The hemi has awesome power, even carrying a heavy load and going up a 6% grade it can accelerate like a sports car to pass trucks. Smooth, comfortable handling. The firm heated seats are great on my injured back, as is the remotely operated rear lift gate. I've had many other SUVs, from Subarus to the old Jeep Grand Wagoneer to a 99 Durango with the 5.7L hemi. The Aspen is far better than all of them. I need to tow a horse trailer and it has more towing capacity than bigger SUVs that cost a lot more. It is almost perfect, I just wish they still made them.

Update: I've owned this Aspen for 9 months now, and I still love it. I love seeing it when I go out the door, I love getting in it, I love driving it. I put on a chrome brush/grille guard made for the same year Durango, it looks awesome. It handles great in mud and snow, too.

It runs wonderfully, and its fun to drive.
I'm 6'4"" tall and it is very comfortable.
I don't know why Chrysler stop making them.
I don't care what Edmunds says this is a great SUV.
I know the gas mileage is average, but it is a truck."
chrysler,aspen,2009,tpedwards, 04/28/2010,Aspen Limited HEV Excellent so far,5,"I wanted to replace my 2005 Durango Limited with another exactly the same. Problem is, they are no longer made. After looking at Jeep Commander (ugly), Ford Explorer (too small), Ford Expedition (too big), Chevy Tahoe (rear not flat), Toyota Sequoia (too expensive) I finally decided to try to find a used Durango or Aspen. I found an Aspen HEV for a reasonable price.  I drove from Battle Creek, MI to Indianapolis, IN spent the weekend then on to Bowling Green, KY and finally had to refuel. 553 miles of mixed highway and city on one tank!  I love this SUV, but I have to imagine that Chrysler discontinued due to sluggish sales and expensive to build."
chrysler,aspen,2009,cappecan, 02/03/2015,So far a great investment!,4,"I purchased my 2009 Aspen hybrid used with 76K. I've owned it now for around 4 months, and have put 14K on it that short time. In this tine, my Aspen has been an absolute dream to drive and own. Most people who see the hybrid badging ask to see under the hood and are rather shocked when you cruise around on electric power alone. I've had no issues thus far aside from routine oil changes and tire rotations. It snows often where I live, and the AWD system handles wonderfully in the slippery slush."

This SUV is fast, especially in cooler temps and is a huge improvement over the first generation hemi. It's an excellent SUV: it's safe, the interior layout is perfect,
the steering is light but feels great, it's quiet when you're cruising but really roars when you give it a few or more rpms. MPG can be good when you're cruising at highway speeds but watch out for stop and go traffic - then it's a different story altogether. Reliability has been great so far. Also, these are incredibly rare to see. A complaint I have is that there is not a single hemi badge on the suv!!"

Been in the shop for over 80+++ days and chrysler refuses to take responsibility and own up to its flaws and buy me out of it.
Tried over and over to get it repaired and finally the dealership may have the right part to fix the problem. Really stinks that they only made a handful of these cars, beautiful and very fast, but when they break down no one knows how to fix it. ARRRRgggh! I would never have bought it if I knew how expensive it was to repair it. Lemon car for sure in my book. Anyone else have issues that cost them thousands $$?"

Steering in wind was no problem with one hand.  Hugs road very well.  Nice acceleration.  Brakes were on the money.  A/C worked brilliantly in 105 degree Texas heat.  Middle row seating could use 2 or 3 more inches for leg room.  Driving visibility was excellent.  Blind spots are minimal.  Rear camera was a bit blurry, but sensors worked well.  "

But since I purchased the car it has been in the repair shop 5 times. for a total of 37 days down time.   Part of the problem is only quailified trained mechanic's can work on the car.  My dealership has one, so if it is his day off we are out of luck.   We have had trouble with check engine light, transfer case, leaking sunroof, computer control module, catalic conveter,paint peeling and now it has been in the shop for 12 days and I still don't have it, because it needs a starter battery.

chrysler,aspen,2009,hannonlaw, 04/19/2009,One Great Vehicle,4,"Editors wrong on this. One great vehicle.   Vehicle smaller than a tahoe; parks easier. Has a fully usable third row seat which an adult can ride in. Have myself ridden 100s of miles in the third row and find it adequate.  With seat configuration I can haul six young men and all their baseball equipment. Have an Enclave too, and this rear set entry easier.  My best buddy says the ride is better than his wife's BMW. Have the Hybrid, and it is a treat to get 18 - 20 mpg in city driving, 4+ mpg greater than my durango which i also loved. Quiet, ergonomics great (better than Tahoe), great electronics and sound. Admit finish could be a little better, but fit, usability and style tremendous."
chrysler,aspen,2009,Greg, 05/14/2009,Impressed,5,"Smooth ride, comfortable seating, plenty of space to take the family on a twelve hour ride to our vacation destination, then twelve hours home.  This vehicle is worth a serious look for those considering the large SUV.  The price is a pleasant surprise, and comparing it to the GM and Ford equivalents, we saved many thousands and got a great vehicle.  The hemi has smooth fluid acceleration and alot of power."
chrysler,aspen,2009,rob94551, 10/18/2009,2nd Aspen,4,"This is our second Aspen.  First has the Hemi. The new engine combo is slower off the line and the Hemi doesn't really kick in until high into freeway speeds, but the transition across the power band is smooth, and is fast enough.  The smoothness of the ride hides the rate of speed increasing.  The add on specials make the car a great value and a lot of small things are thought of (rear view camera), etc.  Great sound system.   Only thing I can think to complain about, if I had to, is the gage that shows if the engine is in electric, combo or power zone.   The car is stable and corners well on mountain road downhills.  The AWD helps with handling, and much improved over non-AWD Aspen"
chrysler,aspen,2009,gomer99, 07/01/2011,Mileage is Terrible,3,"Just traded my 2008 Silverado pickup for a more elegant puller for my travel trailer.
Big mistake!
The Aspen is, indeed, elegant, with all the bells and whistles.
And, with a tow rating of 8900 lbs, it outpulls my truck -- and any Suburban or Expedition on the road,
BUT: Mileage empty tops out at 12.5, feather-footing on country roads, and was 7.7 for towing the trailer.
Looks good, but will be dumped for a diesel next week."
chrysler,aspen,2009,aspen_j, 07/08/2009,Love My Aspen,4,"Had a 2005 Durango and this Aspen drives more like a car when compared to it.  What really sold me on the Aspen was the heavy discounts, Sirius Backseat TV, remote start, alarm, chrome wheels, power liftgate, and 3 rows.  All other brands didn't fit my budget with those same features."
chrysler,aspen,2009,rock47, 07/27/2011,The Beast,4,I have owned an Aspen for 4 years now and it's been nothing but the best for me. I think the middle row has plenty of room and the seats lay back giving you more room. The third row is a little snug but don't anyone sit back there but the kids. I don't know what Aspen anyone else is driving but my Aspen rides smooth!. If I had to say anything bad about it I would say the price of the Aspen is a little steep! and the gas mileage could be a little better. The other sad part about it is they don't make it anymore and I don't wont to go back to a car.
chrysler,aspen,2009,Travis, 01/13/2010,I know why they really quit making these,3,"I have only put on 2000 miles on this and its been to the shop twice.  And still has problems.  Won't start all the time.  Engine light is one, sometimes flashes (that means there is something seriously wrong and not to drive it). The ignition light flashes, going back to the shop tomorrow.  Only goes 35 mph right now.  My navigation system is broken again.  It lasted two days.   The dealership says there is nothing wrong. But then I get it and it wont start. There is not much leg room in the second row.  No cargo space.  If you travel you need a luggage carrier.  If it didn'e keep breaking down I would love it, but there is always something wrong.  I only have 2000 miles on it.  "
chrysler,aspen,2009,2009ASPEN, 10/07/2008,An awesome SUV,5,We recently purchased a 2009 Aspen with the new 5.7 liter HEMI. On the way to work my average MPG came to 22.7 which is incredible for a vehicle of this size and 376 horsepower. Edmunds needs to update its information since the new HEMI is more efficient and has more horsepower than the 2008. The build quality and ride is incredible. Chrysler has done an excellent job! 
chrysler,aspen,2009,Nice Vehicle, 12/29/2009,Nice Vehicle,4,"Bought the dealer demo in Jan. 09 and received an AMAZING deal for what we got. I love all the neat accessories like remote start, heated seats, anti roll, and all those other features you don't even know you have. Have had some issues with the roof racks warping and wind noise. Took to the dealership and they did not take care of issue. Thankfully there is another dealership in the area we can take it for service.

chrysler,aspen,2009,M J Reardon, 03/26/2009,Excellent Hybrid SUV,5,"There's one simple bottom line for the Aspen...VALUE.  This is an excellent full size hybrid SUV, and the gas mileage is good and improving with break in, which you should expect.  Interior and electronics are outstanding.  Handling and ride are very very good, and the big HEMI is there when you need to fly...which you will.  With the tremendous incentives and willingness to deal right now, we purchased this vehicle for a price we simply could not pass up...FAR FAR below the MSRP. With the identical two mode hybrid system as the Cadillac Escalade, you could pay >twice the price we did...but in this economy that simply begs the question ""what planet are you from?"". If you can find one, buy it"

I wanted a Hybrid vehicle, but also desired 4-wheel drive for the winter weather.  The Chrysler Aspen Hybrid was the perfect choice.  The driving is smooth.  I average 20 mpg around town, which includes some interstate driving.  The vehicle is solid with all the luxury features one would desire.  My model has all available options."
chrysler,aspen,2009,Stan in Texas, 09/10/2009,Great Vehicle for the Money,4,"We actually wanted to buy a Tahoe, Yukon or Expedition.  However, a comparably equipped Chrysler Aspen was about $12K less.  That's a lot of money, so we went with the Aspen.  I've never been a Chrysler fan, but I am willing to give them a shot.  I think Edmunds was too hard on the Aspen in their review. So far (2100 miles) we LOVE our Aspen.  This is a leftover 2009 model and the dealer ship was REALLY dealing.  They knocked $11K off the sticker price and gave us $3K more than we owed on our 2007 Explorer."

chrysler,aspen,2009,Kevin K , 08/12/2009,Smooth Hemi Power in a Large SUV,4,"My first impression was that it had a CVT transmission its shifts so smooth, but NO. The transmission does not seem to give the same punch throughout a wide range, my Nissans in the past were much better in that area. Interior makes you feel that you are in a nice vehicle, it is also an attention getter on the exterior. For a 6,400 LB SUV it accelerates fast, you are king of the Trucks/SUVs on the road without a Hemi. Will take ""most"" 6 Cyl Cars as well, just stay away from some of the import powerful V6's like the 2009 Maxima. It is a little bouncy on major dips/bumps, but not overly so. The Brakes are sufficient, but could stop a little better. Handling on sharp bends is average at best."

I didn't expect to keep this car as long as I have but, it just keeps on going.
Had a little annoying issues like passenger rear windown would not roll down for a few years then suddently it decided to start to work and hasn't stopped since. 

The only real beef with the car is where they put the drink holders. With the gear shift in park, you can't put anything larger than a soda can until you put it in gear. No CD player is the other. "

chrysler,cirrus,2000,pltaylor, 06/07/2009,It's still a great car!,4,No major problems with this car at all. High road noise in car. Good sound system with 5 disc multi CD player and cassette deck. Excellent trunk space. Interior leather seats are very comfortable for driver. Also comfortable for other passengers. This is my 2nd Chrysler. I traded in my 2 door Sebring for a 4 door sedan.

chrysler,cirrus,2000,B, 11/23/2015,I regret buying this car.,1,"I bought this car back in April 2015. 2000 Chrysler cirrus. With 193,000 miles on her. It is now November 23 rd 2015 and I'm ready to drive this car into the river and let the fish make it their new home. When I first got it we had to replace the sway bar, then the tie rod end in August. Come mid to late October the car starts cutting off. Everything dropped to 0 the transmission would jerk and she was back firing and missing pretty bad and I had about 20 seconds to get off the road before she cut off. But she would start right back up and go again.  So I had several different mechanics check it out. The fuel pump had gone out so we replaced it and put spark plugs in it. The car still shut off again but this time nothing dropped to 0 it just straight cut off, and the missing and the back firing stopped  It didn't matter if I was in a intersection or on interstate doing 75 mph ( I had both happen)  so we replaced the manifold air intake censor and the map censor and she did great this morning going to work but coming home she cut out on me again but did not turn off. They said next thing to replace is crank censor. 

Sooooo before we started replacing things, I looked up this car and read issues with it etc. so basically from all the posts I've read, around 200,000 miles the computer chip screws up. I can't tell you how many posts I read trying to figure this out. Those folks replaced everything and some including the computer and it still didn't help. Soooo I'm going to replace the crank censor if that doesn't help. I'm getting rid of this car. I can not afford to put a computer in it and I only paid a 1000 for this car I've put a 1000 into it. I'm a single mother and i can't afford to keep doing this. If anybody out there has a solution please let me know.  [contact info removed] I'd greatly appreciate help. I'm really sick of sitting on the side of the road or taking a bus to a certain place and having to walk the rest with a 1 year old. I just for once would give anything to drop my baby off and get to work on time and not have to worry or beg someone to pick my baby up and take us home. Thank y'all. Love and light to you all.

chrysler,cirrus,2000,Jaras500, 09/02/2010,"51,000 miles and lots of problems",3,I bought the Cirrus two months ago and already I've had to fork over almost $700 in repairs.  The car looks nice and the inside is beautiful but that's about it.  The car won't start when it's hot outside or if it rained the night before.  I am having a tuneup done on it to see if that will fix the problem but I'm not getting my hopes up.  The parts for this car are very expensive and you have to take out the entire engine just to get a tuneup done.  Stay far away from this bucket of junk and buy a Toyota Corolla or Chevy Prizm.  At least with them you won't be stranded in a parking lot in 90 degree weather or pouring rain.

chrysler,cirrus,2000,SkyWlf77, 10/13/2007,Fun Car with only a few Quirks...,4,"This car is a blast to drive. The 2.5L V6 is a little sluggish to get going, but once you're moving, mash the gas and prepare for some fun. The gearing is very low in this car, so even in overdrive, the engine is in its powerband. Just keep in mind that this hurts fuel economy (I average 28mpg with a 75/25 city/highway split). The seats are not comfortable for long trips due to a lack of padding. The interior is plasticky and cheap looking/feeling. I've had issue with tie rods and strut mounts giving way prematurely. Tires make a large difference in ride quality.  Car is still going strong at 150,000 miles."
chrysler,cirrus,2000,Nicolas Tweedel, 12/13/2018,Cirriously a great car.,5,"I have to say a very underrated car. I have the Chrysler Cirrus LXi version from the last year model (2000). I bought her a year back as a commuter car here in Houston. My work drive is 75 miles round trip, and this is at least 5 days a week. I bought her for $800 bucks with 154,000 miles on the clock. The only thing I’ve done do her is change the oil and put on the cheapest set of tires I could find. She’s been an absolute beast. Everything works. Even the sunroof, A/C, heat, all windows and all power door locks. Not even a single interior dash light is out. Not to mention not a single warning light is illuminated. Surprisingly no squeaks or rattles. The interior is quiet as a brand new car. I thought this was going to be a fixer upper project car to which I’d be fixing a lot of things frequently to keep on the road. I am using it just for work to keep miles off my nicer car and SUV. But she’s been such a good car, I drive her everywhere now. Without any worries of her leaving me stranded. Quiet, reliable, handles very well for almost 19 years old. The transmission shifts so smoothly you can’t even tell. The 2.5 liter Mitsubishi V6 is still pulls very strong, and the 41TE 4 speed electronically controlled Chrysler auto always seems to have enough torque to push you back into your seat at any RPM. I manage 26 mpg on my mostly highway mile commute. I’ve always been biased towards the Chrysler/dodge/Jeep. Even throughtout their many change of hands of ownership. But this car again I will say was extremely underrated, and if maintained properly I think she will drive for a long time. I’ve put over 10k miles on her in almost a year of ownership and she has never let me down . And all I do it put gas in her and change the fluids when the manual says to. I think she was a steal at $800 bucks. And rare with a sunroof. Previously well maintained or just a good quality automobile.

Back seat leg room may be largest in its class. The one odd problem that I've encountered was a faulty gas cap. $10.00 for a replacement cap - no big deal. Although I've not had this problem, I've heard that Concorde 2.7 motors can go bad due to sludge. I'm wondering if synthetic oil would be a good defense against sludge.  Does anyone know?"
chrysler,concorde,2000,Bill R, 10/17/2016,A Nice Car,4,"I own a 2000 Chrysler Concorde, 2.7L engine, gold exterior, beautiful black leather interior, center console, bucket seats, 150,000 miles on the odometer.  I purchased this car in 2013 when it had 75,000 miles on it.  Pros: Excellent handling, excellent highway gas mileage for a large car (I average 27-28 MPG traveling monthly from Baltimore to Scranton, Pennsylvania, and 30-31 MPG on my return trip. The distance one way is 220 miles.).  Plenty of interior room, especially in the back seat.  Large trunk area. Beautiful, sleek exterior styling, and the interior leather seats, console, instrument panel, and dashboard are very attractive.  Very reliable....I've never had a breakdown of any kind...save for a bad battery and the need to replace a transmission sensor on a previously owned 1999 Concorde.  The 2.7L engine provides plenty of power on the highway but is somewhat under powered for city driving.   With good tires (I currently have Michelin Primacy P225/60R16) the car is fairly quiet and very smooth on a blacktop highway, but is quite noisy on concrete highways and concrete bridge overpasses.  I am hoping that a new set of Michelin Defender tires will lower the road noise on concrete roads.  Overall the noise in the cabin is probably about average. Most noise coming from the road, with some wind noise and a slight amount of engine noise.  Cons:  Limited interior head room for a tall person (I'm 6'-2"" tall and must slouch down to see properly).  Limited visibility which make parallel parking very difficult.  It is very difficult to judge where the front and back of the car are when parallel parking.  The transmission will buck a bit if you slow down for a red light, but then accelerate if the light turns green before you come to a complete stop. Consequently I make sure to accelerate very slowly in this situation. (I did have to replace a transmission sensor in my previously owned 1999 Chrysler Concorde because of accelerating before coming to a complete stop).  The 2.7L engines are known for having sludge build-up problems so be sure to replace the engine oil every 3000-5000 miles.  I use Castrol GTX, an anti-sludge oil. The battery is hidden in the right front wheel well and is very difficult to access.  The headlights and bulbs are very difficult to replace. Braking is well below average and feels mushy (I've been told that this is normal but I have my doubts).  Overall a very reliable, beautiful, fuel efficient, roomy, and well-handling car if you properly care for the engine and transmission.  More specifically, replace the engine oil frequently (due to the sludge build-up problem) and accelerate slowly. Do not accelerate quickly from a stop or before coming to a stop and the transmission should be fine.  The overhead cam sensors on these engine will go bad before 100K but can be easily and inexpensively replaced within 20 minutes if you have any mechanical aptitude."

A few days after I drove it off the lot the cam sensors failed and the engine stopped running - leaving me stranded on side of road.  It was repaired at a cost of approx. $400, plus the $90 tow. After that it was OK except that it burned oil. Now, at 69K miles the engine has blown! I'm told it is a very common problem with the 2.7 liter V6 engine and Chrysler has a kit to repair it. I'm told it will cost between $1000-$1700 to fix this problem. Although I love the looks of this car, it is not worth the trouble. It is comfortable to drive and has nice lines.V6 is junk!"

He drove it mainly back and forth to work everyday (100 miles) So it racked up miles quickly. In 2006 he gave it to my sister with 260k who promptly ATTEMPTED to destroy it, she knocked out the bottom of the windshield washer fluid reservoir, crashed it into a ditch, backed it up into another car, and fried the A/C jumping it the wrong way. I got it in 09 with 280k. I still runs...and sprints, beautifully. People rap on the engine a lot and admittedly mines broke two, and interior rod snapped but that couldn't stop this car. It doesn't have quite as much acceleration as I would like but it is a massive car. It also gets 31 mpg highway.."
chrysler,concorde,2000,Jack in NJ, 10/28/2004,"One year review, bought used",4,"I bought the Concorde exactly 1 yr 
ago.  I was looking for a car for my 
daughter when I ran into this for $8k, 
42K miles at a dealer in mint 
condition.  What a buy!

I am comparing this to my wife's Lexus 
so consider that when looking at my 
ratings.  BTW, my kids prefer riding in 
the Concorde over the Lexus.

If you are looking to buy, CHECK the 
brakes.  Factory rotors are a problem 
but I knew that and factored it into my 
purchase price.  4 rotors & shoes cost 
me $750, be advised.  Otherwise, no 
trouble (15k miles), unlike the other 
posts.  OVER maintain Chryslers, 
especially the transmission.  There is 
a front differential that gets

chrysler,concorde,2000,MarylandJoe, 12/26/2006,ChryslerConcorde_2000,4,"2000 Chrysler Concorde: the best car I've owned. I bought it new.  Interior: well engineered: plenty of leg room, easy access to knobs & switches, and very luxurious.  For a car this size: outstanding 30 mpg on highway and 27 mpg in city. The only maintenance that I do religiously is oil/fluid changes, and replacement of tires, brakes, wipers... It has not let me down yet.  Sleek look: body features and the paint (metallic steel blue) are still in excellent condition after all these years. The ride is smooth and very comfortable with ample power from the v-6.  The only concern - door weather- stripping came loose and does not stay in place - seems to be a bad design. Any fix ideas?"
chrysler,concorde,2000,Mark, 02/17/2007,happy car owner,4,"I'm the original owner and have always babied my cars. I have to say I am very pleased with this vehicle and am SO thankful it has a 3.2 and not the infamous failing 2.7 motor. Lots of pep. With a few accessories it's a looker in town. The only downsides which I've learned to live with are wipers with a mind of their own which mechanics have no idea what's up with them. Just the intermittents. On my third factory radio. Door weatherstripping keeps shrinking and shrinking and causes it to hang. And as many chryslers, the factory chrome lettering is peeling off. Overall, I would recommend this car."
chrysler,concorde,2000,kasmic253, 12/08/2011,Amazing Ride,5,"I just bought a 2000 Concorde LXi for $3000 in Augest and im proud to say that this is an amazing yet huge car! I put 4 new Michelin tires on it but my father got the darkest window tints on it and I can barely see backing up at night...oh well. I'd like to get a backup camera installed just for this reason. Fully loaded with practically everything reasonable. Sunroof, 4 disk cd changer, etc. Only probs are that the ride side of the cup holder is broke is annoying but looks funny and some of the paint is scratched because I brought from a concrete contracter guy and the passenenger window doesnt roll down but I am fixing it here soon. Amazing 3.2L DO NOT GET THE 2.7 OR YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!!"
chrysler,concorde,2000,Unhappy, 03/05/2007,2000 Chrysler Concorde,3,"We received this car from an estate.  It was very well taken care of with only 62,000 miles.  The car drives and handles great.  Interior and trunk space are more than adequate.  We've had to deal with some minor weather stripping problems.  Then two months ago, the infamous 2.7 liter engine blew because of excessive oil sludge and timing chain problems.  Chrysler has hired a company to deal with the engine problem claims.  Their compensation is insulting and inadequate.  Do not, under any circumstances, buy Chrysler products.  I'm very disappointed with how they are taking care of their customers."

so I needed a full sized car to handle 
us.  The 2000 Concorde LXi fit my

it), good gas mileage at about 25 mpg 
overall, stylish looks, and a great 
interior with a superb stereo system 
make this car an pleasure to drive."

the car over heated all the time even though i fixed the thermostat, water pump,radiator and the fans in it and when i took it to the Chrysler dealership they were baffled. wouldn't recommend it to anyone and i learned not to go for looks only performance "
chrysler,concorde,2000,BL Elliott, 09/13/2010,Disappointed to say the least,3,"I saved for months to buy this car. I loved the room in the back seat and trunk area is HUGE! Loved the streamline look of the car with leather and a sunroof. Then it started. A/C failed, power windows failed, rubber seals around the doors were falling off every time I opened the door, and don't dare take it to a car wash. And if that wasn't bad enough, the 2.7 engine started to ""tick"". Come to find out that this engine is famous for SLUDGE. It gets trapped in the top of the engine and kills the horsepower and overall performance of the car. Very disappointed in this ""American"" car. Makes me sad to know I might have to buy a foreign car to get some reliability. It's just sad. "

chrysler,concorde,2000,bowman271, 05/31/2008,Poor Investment,4,"I bought this vehicle with 78,000 miles.    Aside from the door weather stripping problems this seemed to be a great car.  Then at 102,000 the check engine light came on.  I was told by Chrysler that the engine was known for trapping oil in the upper engine causing excessive oil sludge.  This was the cause of my problems and because of this I had to replace the crank shaft sensor and another I can't name at the moment costing me $650.00.  I was also told by Chrysler that I would need a rebuild in the near future witch would cost me $6 ,000-$7,000.  This apparently is an existing problem since 1997 with the 2.7 lt engine.  I will never buy a Chrysler again.  Very, Very disappointed!"
chrysler,concorde,2000,buyamericanonly, 06/07/2008,Great Car. Why Buy Import Luxury?,4,"I have had my car for almost a year. Purchased it used with 57k on it. This car has all the bells and whistles as the more expensive import cars but half the price. The 3.2 engine is very strong but I still get mid 20's on the gas mileage. It is very comfortable on the inside and plenty of room. The trunk is so big ""You can fit 5 bodies in there."" The only problem I have had is having to replace the weather stripping due to shrinkage and the headlights filmed over a little. There is no reason to purchase a more expensive import car when these cars are half the price and just as reliable. Take it from me I am a sales manager at an import dealership. Just follow the scheduled maintenance."
chrysler,concorde,2000,Midwest Mom, 06/15/2008,A sinking ship,3,"I bought this car used 3 1/2 years ago with 65,000 miles on it.  I loved it for the first year, then the air conditioner stopped working, $1000 repair.  The weather stripping around the doors is too small and had to be replaced.  Another year later the door locks began making a horrible sound.  Another year and a half later and the 2.7 L engine is trash, despite regular maintenance and religious oil changes every 3000 miles.  This car does not even have 100,000 miles on it.  I can't afford the $4000 repair, and many shops won't even work on this engine because they don't want to warranty it.  Best offer I've had for the car is $50 after tow cost.  I feel like I've been lied to and ripped off. "

Dealership can't figure out why wiper delay doesn't work properly when below freezing. Replaced radio 3 times. Weatherstipping shrinks and falls off. But, if you can put up with these little things and slap on a few exterior accessories and tint the windows, this car will make heads turn! It looks really sharp and rich. Handles tight and is peppy with the 3.2 engine. Transmission no problems. Lots of room and very comfortable. I would recommend it. Just don't get the 2.7 motor or you'll regret it."

refinement.  Otherwise, the car is 
great.  70,000 miles and it's still as 
solid as the day I drove it off the

car was small gasket leak in the 
transmission.  Very reliable compared

After 2 months front hub assy failed. 2 months after that vibrating engine and oil lite stayed on. Renewed Engine put in. 2 Wks later speed sensors need to be replaced. After 1 year and 3 months renewed engine went out again. This car is just setting up with a car note/full insurance still on it and being paid!  "
chrysler,concorde,2000,chryslerhater, 04/29/2010,Engine,3,"I cannot understand why a huge company like Chrysler produces such a poor product. the 2.7 liter engine is a joke. I have seen so many reviews of people having to replace it, completely ridiculous. I maintain the car perfectly, never drive above the speed limit, never accelerate fast, in others words, I baby it. And at 113,000 the engine goes out and when I am looking around for a used one I have had dealers literally laugh in my face because it is such a common item. In their words they ""hardly ever see that engine unless it is blown"" thanks for nothing Chrysler."

plethora of cookie cutters out there.  
The ""leather"" trimmed seats could 
actually use at least another 
micrometer of color. Other things 
worry me to.  The paint on the lower 
plastic parts have already worn off 
and have been repainted at about 
20,000 miles.  The dealship gave me 
such a hassle. So much for FIVE star 
service.  Hopefully Mercedes can help 
these shmucks out at Chrysler and not 
let the lack of quality at Chyrsler 
infect Mercedes.  Also the dealership 
where I bought my car scratched it 
from bumper to bumper.  They called 
it ""prepping"".   Live and learn...."

Then the door locks started to make a bad noise when you use them. Then the engine blew. We have found out that about 2/3 of all the 2.7L engines have blown and there might be a class action suite against Chrysler. If you do get a Concorde DO NOT get the 2.7L engine. I know of engines failing anywhere from 15,000 on up. We have had a few Chrysler vehicles in the past but I will never buy another one again, it is a shame because I have a relative who works for them."

One word describes how this car rides:  
smooth.  There are plenty of places to 
put coffee, too, with two cup holders 
in front and two in back.  The seats 
are comfortable, with plenty of leg 
room for all passengers.

I would recommend this car to anyone 
looking for a big sedan.  It has lots 
of interior space, a huge trunk, and is 
very reliable.  The mileage is also 
pretty good; I average 26 MPG on my

At 74,000 miiles the 2.7 L engine blew, need to repalce or rebuild.  After doing much research I found many major problems with this engine.  Oil sludge builds up and the parts do not get lubricated.  Chyrsler is not accepting responsiblity.  Many, many people are stuck with repair bills in the thousands of dollars.

little on the lower side, but that's to 
be expected  with such a large car 
being pushed by a 2.7l six cylinder.  
Huge trunk and plenty of room.  We've

Currently, it is at a dealership and 
in need of a $5000 new engine due to a 
thrown rod.  It has less than 75,000 
miles on the engine, so what gives?  
My 1990 GMC Suburban with 200,000 on

Faced with this option I decided to replace the car.  Research over the past few weeks has revealed that the Chrysler 2.7 liter engine appears to have many problems.

When we bought it we chose to replace it's battery and tires, tinted it's windows and have changed it's oil every 3000 miles - nothing more - and today it still drives like a new car with reliability and very good fuel economy!

My wife (fiance at the time) bought this car in July '04 with 31k miles on it.
It's been nothing short of a workhorse for us.
Of course at around 50k miles, the check engine light came on, and looking around online, I found tons of reports of the dreaded engine sludge fiasco, but it seems mine was a later 2001 model that avoided this issue. The light turned out to be for an emission issue that didn't affect how well the car ran.

While we have all heard stories about the previous owner being an old lady that babied the car, in this case, I knew the owner and knew that to be the case. The car had been maintained by a local Chrysler dealership with 3,000 mile oil changes and had 42K at the time of my purchase. At around 50,000 the transmission welded itself solid, common problem with this model. Now at 75K it has major engine failure. What a piece of junk. Chrysler should be ashamed. And this is on top of the fact that the trunk supports are weak and the trunk constantly falls on your head when retrieving items from it. My first Chrysler & my last"
chrysler,concorde,2001,dlong163, 12/10/2012,"167,000 strong... good bang for the family sedan buck!",4,"The 3.2 liter models were superb to other offerings at the time.
If you don't like the exterior design, add a spoiler, and voila!
This car is reliable, has never failed me.
I have kept with regular maintenance since I received it at 114,000 miles, and the previous owner kept it and recorded it as well.
The only major problems I've encountered is the ABS pump failing (not a huge deal) and my frame was warped when I drove over an unmarked curb, causing a clunk I can't eliminate despite all new front suspension.
I can't blame Chrysler for a business not marking their curbs.
Overall, a great car.
I've met owners with 250K on their daily drivers, I'm sure this one will make it!"
chrysler,concorde,2001,Marc Sheltra, 06/17/2018,Concorde applause,4,"Mine had very low mileage for the year and as a result somethings are in exceptional shape other things time is not great for so I’m looking at air conditioning replacement and a few other things that don’t age well with time.  The car is exceptionally roomie very comfortable and stylish good looks and I understand it’s one of the first cars totally created by a computer as far as optimization of space aerodynamics etc.   3.2 L engine is spirited enough to move the car briskly you might think it’s a luxury sports car of sorts. I find service parts to be reasonably price and the only complaint I could have his gas mileage around town is 15ish.  You get the best gas mileage obviously on the highway but mostly because the car is low presents very little wind drag so it doesn’t require the horsepower you would think for car of the size at highway speed. I.e. it’s  aerodynamically slippery . Interior is very well appointed and a classy style not soon to fade. Although it has no gps or MP3/booth to othe smart link, find an old cassette adapter and plug in your smartphone and voila....state of the art nav and music plus phone calls lol perfect.

chrysler,concorde,2001,CEHE4KA, 06/04/2003,"Very nice, very good, but trans sucks",4,"I bought a 19 months old LXI with 
20,000 on odometer to replace my 1993 
LXI.  The car is great, but the 
transmission is tuned so the RPMs 
rarely go below 2000 under 40mph.  This 
makes the fuel economy in city traffic 
worse.  Also the trans does not down 
shift fast enough.

The other problem that I have with the 
car is damage it sustaines in 
collisions.  I had a low speed front 
end collision 4 months after buying the 
car (first accident ever).  The damage 
was massive.  I learned that the bumper 
with this grill is not very durable."

Although I had done oil changes regularly the engine was caked with gunk! I still owed...so I replaced it and am using premium gas and better quality oil. So far with the refurbished engine I've put 72,000 miles on it. Other than the car just up and dying on me the one time, it's been extremely reliable, starts great, still runs smooth and has been roomy enough to accommodate my growing children. The paint job still shines. When I'm ready to purchase another car I will consider a Chrysler again, with a different engine. "

Now a 167k the transmission axle on the passenger side is loose and and noisy. Father don't buy this car for your daughter's first car to take to college. Other minor issues are door windows move slow and the window control switches won't stay in place. When i bought the car it rode great and still looks great but every 30 thousand i have to put in the shop for a major repair i love the car but i don't think i would buy it again. 
chrysler,concorde,2001,70_Malibu, 10/04/2006,Beware the LX model with the 2.7 liter!,3,"I purchased the car used (with the 2.7 liter engine) as a a roomy rather fuel efficient, full sized family vehicle.  The car had 65,000 at the time of purchase.  Less than a year later, at 75K, the internal water pump failed and flooded the engine with coolant, and also a loose exhaust valve guide caused the valve to wiggle and not seat seat properly, in turn causing damage to the valve seat.  Hence the cylinder wouldn't hold compression.  The total cost of repairs was $2,481 !!  The 2.7 liter has an awful reputation of premature, catastrophic failures.  Research the web!!  I did, but it was too late for me!  Stay away from the 2.7.  Trust me."

Perhaps 6 months after the purchase I know why. I started hearing rumbling/throttling noise that sounded internal. Smaller garages wouldn't touch the problem.   No engine lights were on. I thought Chrysler would know what it was better then anyone. They're more expensive but they would know their car better than anyone. I had to replace the crank shaft at a cost of $3,100. I contacted Chrysler to see if they could help cover some of the cost since it only had 66K miles on it but they were no help. The dealer kept my car for 8 days with no loaner.

was because the antenna is in the rear 
window, and when the rear defrost was 
on it had a little static if listening 
to the radio, no biggie.  Slightly 
rough idle, but is very reliable.  You 
get a very nicely finished car for a 
great price, but you get a slightly 
rough idle that runs excellently.  I 
see no problem there.  "

car we knew based on past experience,  that we wanted a new Concord. We 
were extremely happy with the performance and luxury options and have not 
been disapointed with the new car."

chrysler,concorde,2002,George Budlong, 08/10/2008,One of my Best Cars,5,"This has been one of the better cars I have owned.  I get 28 MPG on the highway and around 21-22 mpg in the city.  I have all the ""bells and whistles"" on it except for a moon roof. I maintain it on a regular basis and only have had the usual wear and tear like brakes and front end alignment.  I hesitate to trade for an economy car as the mileage would not be that much better and I would sacrifice the ride and comfort."
chrysler,concorde,2002,Tony, 03/13/2009,Owned 2 years so far,5,I have owned my concorde limited for 2 years almost and i would have to say it has been one of the best cars i have ever owned.  After 2 years and buying it used the only thing that i have had to fix is one tire from running over a nail.  Unfortunately the only thing that i could complain about is the trim piece on the hood that has started to weather and the glaze has started to peel off other than that the car is great.
chrysler,concorde,2002,orlando, 06/14/2009,Best Car Ever,4,"I bought this car used with the 3.5L engine in it in  2007 and since then I had no major problems with the vehicle other then the A/C which stopped working.It turned out to be a broken hose which cost me $275 to fix.Other than that ,do your general maintenance and the car will treat you right.Love the factory navigation unit it came with but updating the disc can be pricy if you get it from the dealer ($250)."
chrysler,concorde,2002,lemon02, 09/04/2009,MULTIPLE ISSUES,4,"Shortly after we brought the car in for its 60000 mi maintenance which included coolant flush & fill, it overheated several times.  We brought it back to the garage & they told us that some particle had gotten stuck in the system.  They flushed & filled it again (no charge).  A couple of years later it developed a fuel leak which goes away after engine warm up.  We brought it back to the garage for this & they replaced the fuel injector seals but it still leaks.  We have brought it back several more times but they cannot fix the problem.  My suspicion is that the leak developed as a result of the engine overheating some years ago.  Several other issues as well. Not enough space to write here"

not buy another crysler because the 
service is so poor"
chrysler,concorde,2002,Bremen Sedai, 10/21/2002,Concorde Rocks,4,"This is definately one of my favorite 
cars. Chrysler has done for the large 
sedan what it did for the convertible: 
completely set a new standard for 
design and value. The Concorde's ride 
is better than many 'luxury' vehicles I 
have ridden in, and it's options are 
well designed and appealing. The 
quality is great and the price is more

again."

No major mechanical problems, just routine maintenance (changing fluids, brake pads, tires). Real-world fuel mileage averages in the 21-24MPG range (the advertised 28MPG only happens if you drive at or below 60MPH) Some minor electrical problems: window motor went out, flickering dome light.

truly delighted and satified with what 
Chrysler has done to this model.  Lots 
of power both under the hood (engine) 
and dash (stereo).  For the price this 
is porbably the best value of any car 
on the market.  The interior and 
exterior looks are second to none.  
Having just turned 50 I'm enjoying 
myself as much as I did in the 60's-
70's with the muscle cars of that era.  
Living in Canada I would have thought 
that heated seat would be standard in

chrysler,concorde,2002,lea, 03/27/2002,pleased & disappointed,4,The car does idle rough when stopped.  The reason we have been given is that the car computer is set to thin out fuel after the 2000 mile break-in period to give better fuel economy.  Blind spots which are a concern. The heat/air controls have been noisy and blend door replaced.

chrysler,concorde,2003,TanyaB, 06/23/2010,2.7 L engine failure,2,"I bought this car 6 years ago and was very pleased with it at first. A very nice ride and handled nicely in bad weather. For the most part, it had been a good car. Then, out of nowhere the check engine light came on and before we could get it in to the shop, the car completely died. Our mechanic told us that it was complete engine failure due to oil sludge. Keep in mind, the car doesn't even have 90,000 miles on it yet and oil was changed regularly. I have since found out by doing some research that Chrysler vehicles with the 2.7 L engine are prone to major engine issues even at relatively low mileage due to defects in engine design. Do some research before buying!"

chrysler,concorde,2003,Computer Guy, 01/15/2017,"Used comfort comes at a price, over and over again",3,"The Chrysler Concorde is fairly stylish for a sedan.  The huge windshield and low hood is great.  I've owned this car for 5 years and put 75,000 of the 175,000 on the odometer.  I the past 5 years I've replace the TRANSMISSION (twice) and the ALTERNATOR.  The other parts were just due to normal wear and tear, and those being the brakes, tires, wheels, headlights (excessively foggy), windshield, battery, and two radiator reservoirs bottles.

The dealer just worked on the car in January ($1006) because of a valve that let to the engine light coming on.  Something to do with emissions.  I have had many cars, I have never had a motor blow.  The car was regularly maintained.  this is my first and last experience with a Chrysler product. "
chrysler,concorde,2003,Scott George , 05/16/2007,Great Family Car,4,My Concorde is the best driving car I've ever owed. The only problems are its to low to the ground for large folks like me. It is missing hand holders on the front passenger side which are needed. The body style is boring. The car rides great and it loves highway speeds. The car feels very safe which is good going at highway speeds.

With the limited package, this car provides both luxury and performance.  I commute 150 miles roundtrip each day.  The luxury quietness is calming before and after work.  If another car wants to ride my rear and then zoom around me, this car has enough horsepower to be competitive (almost always wins if in the same V6 class).  Keep the oil changed and the exterior washed and waxed and this car is a very good value."

The back seat is very accomodating, and it is very comfortable everywhere.  The sound system is great too, along with the leather seats.  Even as a used car, the condition is excellent.  The only issue that I find being a problem is fuel economy and some wind noise, but otherwise this car is great on the road.  It rides very well, and makes you feel secure behind the wheel.  "
chrysler,concorde,2003,Hollis, 12/19/2006,Great touring car,5,I've had this car for three years and love it.  We live in a mountainous area but the Concorde has power to spare.  Gas mileage on the highway is often over 30 miles/gallon.  Because we are rural we often travel over three hours per trip.  Our Concorde is so comfortable and roomy that we enjoy the trips.

In fact, it drives so easily, you can drive it with one finger on the wheel. The trunk space on this car is unbelievable.

After test driving both, it was a no- brainer, the Concorde blew away the Neon, in comfort, ride, power & interior. (Neon was noisey, bumpy, cramped. Although it had a cam sensor error shortly after purchase,(had to be replaced), and then an engine check light and rouph idle for a couple weeks, it finally went away and has run great ever since.  It gets 24mpg in town and 32mpg hwy, unless the A/C is on, then its only about 22/28. Driver's seat it very adjustable even the lumbar support. The leather seats are soft and east to keep clean. It has lots of room and drives like a sports car."

Easy fix. Drive belt tensioner had to replaced twice and the exhaust valve seals needed to be replaced at 155,000. I just drove 1800 miles across country and got 29.5 mpg. That's not bad for a car that has over 150,000 miles on it. Oh the standard tape deck is garbage."

out of the dash.  Wires and all.  Had 
it fixed, did it again.  Going back to

I have already spent thousands trying to remedy the problem. The electrical will dim upon occassion.

far superior and everything like driver

ride compared to our old Honda Accord

compare it to the comfort you get.  It 
gets around 24 to 26 miles per gallon.

well. The car offers a comfortable 
driving position, and good head and 
shoulder room. The low roof line limits 
how close you can pull up to traffic

I was not looking for this car but, when I found it I instantly fell in love! The car is fun to drive, plenty powerful (you won't be beating Corvettes in it - if you want to race high-power sports cars get something else), and handles much better than my BMW 330 did. 

Two issues I'd like to speak to: the engine mechanicals are a bit loud - relax, you're not about to throw a rod! Rearward visibility obviously isn't like a mini-van, but you'll acclimate to it quickly. If you want one, buy one, you be glad you did! "

There is no doubt about who built this car, it's German heritage shines through in performance and design. Simply stated, this car is absolutely fantastic from its brilliant skin to it's impressive manners and a plush interior that isn't found in many cars 3 times it's price.

chrysler,crossfire,2004,Mike, 06/19/2016,Awesome car for the price,4,"Bought the 04 model because everything was standard that year. Not a daily driver for a guy 6'3 (6'0 probably the limit) but I bought it for weekend use on backroads and getaways .  I like it's uniqueness in my area and it's rarity in the world. Yes you can find better performers, but not for less the double what i paid. The brakes approach supercar status with it's stopping power and the Mercedes drivetrain is a big plus. My car has 93k on it but most of those miles were between 04 and 2012 so I had it inspected by my mechanic and he found no issues.  A fun car and well worth the price if your looking for a coupe on a budget.

chrysler,crossfire,2004,Scott MacMillan, 08/01/2008,"25,000 miles and still happy",4,"My Crossfire has all of the build quality and reliability you would expect-- but rarely get from a German made car. After 25k miles there are no rattles or squeaks, mechanically it hasn't missed a beat, and the factory original tires (Continentals) have only just given up the ghost. The car is a sports car, not a grand touring car, and as such has some sports car short comings, chief of which is a slightly cramped interior package. Anyone over 6ft will find that this isn't the best long distance car on the road. But for short jaunts and weekend escapes it is pretty much unbeatable. Excellent (but not superb) handling combined with ""one of a kind"" styling makes the Crossfire a joy to own. "
chrysler,crossfire,2004,1hot6, 11/26/2008,Middle age; no crisis,4,"I traded in an 06 Mustang, show car, for my 04 Crossfire in March 08.  While I honestly do miss some of the Mustang's personality I absolutly love my Crossfire! This vehicle surpasses any other car I've owned to include a BMW z3. It's not the fastest but then again who really is?!  The car handles flawlessly and Ive found myself pushing upwards to 80mph on back country twisties. It gets looks everywhere I go and best of all there aren't a lot of them around unlike the ""me-too"" Mustangs. Only problem was my own doing as I put an aftermarket exhaust which causes occasional vibration/resonnance but the car sounds like it should for the looks. It's destined to be a classic! No more built after 2008"
chrysler,crossfire,2004,Dave V., 04/13/2017,Best Car For The Money,5,"I bought my 2004 Crossfire not long ago purely by chance. I had pulled into a used car lot to look at a Porsche Cayenne when my wife spotted the Crossfire. Turns out the dealership had just repossessed the car and offered it to me for what was owed on it. The price was so reasonable I couldn't turn it down. I have had many sports cars and my last toy was a Jaguar XK8 but have had several Porsche, Jags and others that cost much more. While at 60 it isn't the easiest car to get in and out of it isn't too bad and somewhat expected. I had loved the way the XK8 had performed and I was surprised that the Crossfire actually performs even better. It is just a great looking and fun car to drive. Me not being content to leave any car alone I have replaced the stereo with one that has bluetooth and have done a few other things and will do more as I am looking at putting in a dash kit in carbon fiber as while okay I think it will dress it up inside a little. I have also ordered a performance chip although the car is already fast enough without it.Looks, style and performance at an affordable price, what more could you ask for.

chrysler,crossfire,2004,ugetcaughtupinthe, 04/10/2008,Just awesome,4,"I love this car. I have tons of fun driving it on the highway, but the real rush is on country back roads. The car hugs the road. I drive hard and fast, and I almost never hear the tires (especially over the more than ample stereo). The wing that comes up at around 60 mph lets me know that I might want to back off the accelerator, but I usually don't. Its interior is small, but I mean come on look at the car. The controls are difficult to figure out, but easy to use, and there is a cup holder hidden in the center console. The vehicle isn't that bad in the snow and ice either (it has a winter mode, but don't try busting through snow drifts). Overall, its a steal for any true 2 seater."

N I love it great car I took turns at 85 mph n only 35 zone no problem handles n drives great ..I did hve to put valve cover gaskets on at 74k n replaced exhaust at 74k but only cause there is no e check here so I took cat out on exhaust ect.. I did hve replace belt idler pulley at 74k ect.. Just basic maitence so oil changes unless u do them yourself are pricy cause it uses 0 40w pure synthetic racing oil so keep tht kinda stuff in mind ...but mine is auto with manual it has both thts the one I recommend do not get the manual with clutch get auto with manual slap stick also does OK in winter it has a winter/summer selection on transmission ..n also the coupe with all options has a really nice stereo infinity doores with tweeters n amplifier with sub woofers in all factory which is nice n I'm pretty sure thts not available on the convertible ..which I hate rag tops so but a hard top removal one would be great also all Mercedes Benz mechanics told me not too buy the car in the last year made cause its a set model n dnt hve Mercedes drive train n it has a fixed wing instead of the Mercedes tht deploys at 61 mph n retractks at 37 n also last year onez made have a supercharger on a Chrysler v6 instead of a Mercedes motor n thy ones with the supercharger had problems but just put a super chip in it its better than the SRT one ..highly recommend this car but remember the maintance cost on it cause I only take it too Mercedes to get worked on n its same car as the slk also the color on mine they made the fewest of which to me is the best color its silver saphire blue metallic it changed from a light real pretty blue to silver depending on sun n time of day

One was the door had rust building up due to the weather striping not being properly put on. The warranty took care of this. The other was the car has no spare tire. I had a blow out and no way to fix it. Since Chrysler does not offer a good road side assistance program on flat tires for a car that they make with no spare tire, I had to leave it on the side of the road and wait for help at 3:30 am . At the end total bill was $995.00 including the tire. Don't get me wrong I love the car, however I will never buy a Chrysler again due to the warranty leaving me stuck out.

chrysler,crossfire,2004,Lisa, 06/16/2019,Big rewards,4,"I've had 2 Crossfires, the first one was a convertible.  The convertible had plenty leg room and very few blind spots, absolutely loved it.  Tboned a stopped truck at about 35mph and came out with no major injuries, I'm guessing because there was such a long hood I was safer.  Bought  a hard top afterwards and love it too.  I have a problem hitting my head on the door frame getting in and also this car has a lot of blind spots but otherwise I totally love my Crossfire! I need to buy a bigger car so I can pick up my grandson but I will definitely keep my crossfire, I mean I can't be in ""grandma mode"" all the time lol.  If your buying one be prepared to pay a lot more for oil changes, this car takes 8 quarts of pure synthetic oil.  That's one thing I wasn't prepared for. It does have a comfortable ride even for long drives. All in all, this is a great car.

seats are a little small for 62, but 
good. Turn signal switch is too close 
to cruise control. The side windows 
are tiny, the C-pillars are too wide. 
Both pedals and the wheel are heavy, 
as the whole car is. They feel numb,

suspension? The engine is OK, the 
breaks are horrible, I locked them up 
twice on a hot asphalt of Vegas, while

locking them up."

Chrysler unable/unwilling to fix warranty item, tried to buy back for half value. Dealer claimed no responsibility, deferred to Chrysler. Both unwilling to do the right thing by consumer.

describe this car. From the moment I

tell how much attention it demands. 
This car truly demands respect on the

somewhere, people always have questions 
about the car, how much it costs, etc. 
The handeling is great and it truly is 
an absolute joy to drive. It's 
definitely a lot of fun shifting the

the red and black interior which 
definitely give the car more character.

The body had no nicks or scratches and looked brand new. It has been a fun car to drive and I always get positive comments on this looker.

Due to our snowy Canadian winters, I had to park it for about 5 months, but cannot wait to uncover her and hit the freeways again. It turns heads wherever I go, and people just stare and ask what it is constantly. I am only 5'8"", so getting in and out are a breeze. It handles like it is on rails, and makes every trip fun! I know it's not as fast as the 350Z or TT, but I feel it is a much sharper looking car, and lives up to the Mercedes name in every way. I have driven Jags and high end Acuras, and this car feels and looks more expensive. If you have the chance, buy one and hold on! This is a future collector's car for sure!"

(they drove down the value of the vehicle.)  Because of that, I purchased a luxury sports car at the price of a Kia!  The car is perfect for me, and I paid less than 1/2 its value when it was 1.5 years old, with only 4000 miles on it.  It is better than any other sports car I tried:  better than 350Z, Madza, TT, Honda, etc.  Only the Porsche Boxster was better, and it would have cost me 2x as much.  The car has speed, great handling, great looks (everybody stares when I drive by), and  great gas mileage.  It also has great trunk space no other sports car can match.

with my hands and it is very hard to 
use this switch. The sun visor can't be 
swiveled to use on the side windows. 
The seats are BAD. Not just 
uncomfortable but on a trip of any 
duration you will have to adjust the 
seat several times or just stop and get 
out to give your back a break. The 
drivers seat has lots of adjustments 
but if you are 6' or over you will have 
to move the seat all the way back to 
get in or out, and it can take for ever

Great everyday driver with plenty of power to handle hills and highways, Have been from Monterey to San Diego and also to Vegas and back, and it's perfect for long road trips for two. After 11/2 years, the car is still tight with no problems to report;just rountine maintenance. Interior is quiet & comfortable with super sound system.

to drive a Maserati with a 24 value V-6 and 
find that the Crossfire feels as strong (except

more than 10 min and you'll agree.  The 
car feels good and is as tight as you would

tires, because the factory rubber is 
similar to racing slicks, & would 
promote off-roading in the winter. 
 The Crossfire is way too much fun to 
drive. "
chrysler,crossfire,2004,MARYHELEN HAGGE, 11/14/2003,Crossfire review,5,"Incredibly fun to drive.  Noticed 
immediately by colleagues.  It only 
has two seats which means you can't 
pick up people.  That limits your 
opportunity to show off this stunning 
vehicle.  Accelerates well.  Handles 
curves adroitly.  Comfortable on long 
trips.  Easy cruise control."

chrysler,crossfire,2004,Dvetteguy, 11/30/2003,Crossfire is one hot ride,4,"The Chrysler Crossfire is in fact one 
hot ride. It would be easy to leave it 
at this by just saying that everyone 
that sees the car thinks that it cost 
much more than it does. I have found no 
one that does not love the looks of the 
car. It does not nook as generic as 
most of the cars in it's class. The 
ride is solid in the way of a Mercedes 
sedan and performs great. Handles great 
as if on rails. I also own a Corvette, 
and have owned z-cars, a Porsche, 
Mustangs and Cameros. This car is the 
real deal. Check it out before you buy 
anything else.You also receive matching 
luggage.  "
chrysler,crossfire,2004,jeff fisher, 11/30/2003,Crossfire Stirs Passion - Play.,4,"If you're looking for a car with 
serious road presence - Crossfire is 
for you. Grip is tenacious from huge 
wheel/tire combo and well-sorted 
Mercedes suspension. 5-speed auto is 
smooth & learns your driving style as 
you go. V6 power is plenty (for 0-60 
in 6.4 secs)and an even torque band. 
Not a noisy sports car, a 
sophisticated coupe - and different!"

chrysler,crossfire,2004,Jerry, 06/02/2005,Helpful Tips,4,"This if my first sports car and I love it.   Ride:  You do feel the road but it is not uncomfortable  Tires:  Expensive to replace aprox $1,200 for a full set  Oil Change:  Conflicting reports, dealer says 3,000 miles and $100 to change oil.  Book says 7,000.  I would go by the book and shop around for better deal on the cost  Visability:  Lots of blind spots, be sure to have your side mirrors set properly and you will be fine.  Also, when parking if you can have the nose out it is much safer.  To accomplish this you can either back in or pull through to the next space.  Interior:  I am short so the seating is not a problem. For those with longer legs it is much more difficult"
chrysler,crossfire,2004,CWT, 11/24/2003,Too Much Plastic,4,"This could be a really great car except 
there is just too much plastic in it.  
The door handles should be metal; the 
side vent accents should be metal (the 
plastic really cheapens the looks which 
in turn reflects on a lack of 
confidence in the product); this car 
also needs to have a ""moon roof"" 
option.  Do all this and then you will 
have a really great car and sales 
volume would go up directly!"

couple of weak spots.  Draws a lot of 
attention everywhere, especially when 
the rear spoiler comes up.
Suspension / wheel combination makes 
the car a bit hard on bad roads but 
does a remarkable job in the handling 
department  --  at least up to 110 
mi/hr. Over 110 the car gets a little 
light and somewhat hard to keep 
pointed.  Traction on wet roads is 
remarkable considering the weight / 
power ratio."

forward to my moring drive into work

is nothing like it on the road. This

handles just as promised. While it's 
not long on a roomie truck, that 
certainly is not why I bought it.  The

chrysler,crossfire,2004,Kent, 08/15/2005,Great car,5,I bought my Crossfire this summer and have been very glad I did.  The car was used but only had 2500 miles on it.  It is one of the most fun cars I have every driven and handles fantastic. My gas mileage has been very good so far averaging around 21.0 which isnt bad at all. The Mercedes SLK engine is very smooth and willing to move and the six speed for the most part is smooth.  The car is the sapphire blue color with the two tone leather inside which in my eyes is one of the best colors offered. It does get ALOT of attention no matter where I go.  Being taller (6 2) I was concerned about room inside but that is not an issue although I am still trying to get the seat just right. Fantastic! 
chrysler,crossfire,2004,Elizabeth Klotzer, 08/30/2005,I love this car!,4,"My fiance and I purchased a 2004 Chrysler Crossfire in July, 2005.  It was essentially a new car, only 19 miles on it.  This car replaced my old Chrysler Cirrus.  I LOVE the Crossfire!  My two dogs, a Collie and a Corgi, fit comfortably in the hatchback and enjoy looking out the window.  The hatchback has more room than it appears: we fit the dogs and two large hiking backpacks in there.  Incredibly zippy and turn heads everywhere, this car drives like a very expensive sportscar.  You can really tell that 3/4 of the Crossfire is Mercedes components.  I might regret my decision in winter, but boy this car is something to drive! No real complaints, although the rear is difficult to see out of"

is you can't brag about and you know 
how those Japanese car drivers like to

handles cornering extremely well, 
great at making tight turns and makes 
a wonderful autocross car.  The huge

the rght rear view is non-existent,

wading through alot of dealer B.S. to 
try to buy one.  I'd hate to see the 
non 5 star dealers.  I don't find 
the ""lack of rearward visibility"" to 
be an issue while driving.  Only when 
trying to back out of a parking space. "

it's the most fun car I've ever had...

Easy to drive, easy to maneuver through 
traffic.  I haven't had it in 6th yet. 
I'll have to hit the Interstate later 
today. 

You'll have to learn to navigate via 
mirrors since the back window is small.

If you're shy, you'll make all kinds of 
new friends.  People stop me everywhere 
to ask me about it.  "

Porsche, 300Z, & a Supra. I was 
thinking about buying the BMW Z4, but 
then after driving the Crossfire I 
totally forgot about the Z4. I had to 
have the car after I drove it, and this 
car is a buy not a lease. What I love 
and suprized was the handling and the 
attention I get. A week after buying it 
I took it for a test and I was doing 
85mph without brakes on a 25-35mph road 
i was suprized felt like i was driving 
my porsche, i love it."

great, although it really wasn't a

last. "

its second-to-none looks and go-getter

people. I find it so funny when they 
ask,""what kind of car is that?"" Then 
they ask the price, and then when I 
tell them, they are shocked it is so 
reasonably priced.  Alot of praise to 
Chrysler for finally making a fun fast

told the Nissan sales person I would be

I don't think so, I test drove the X-

grabs the road like nothing I have 
ever driven. The speaker system kicks, 
and the looks kill. When I pass people 
I feel like I am in a Porche or 
something because everyone slows down 
to look. 

The Turlock Delership made me an offer 
unlike any other. Also the service you 
get from Chrysler because of owning a

Given that I paid $23,464 for my new

It is crisp in response, throaty in  
exhaust note, and cornors on rails

Entrance and exit take getting used to -
unless you are a professional jockey or 
swimsuit model, in which case size and 
body stiffness are not a problem.

I have to admit, the resale value on this is most likely not going to be great, but it is such a great looking specialized car. It is my first two seater, and it takes getting a little use to, but it is fun to drive.  I agree with other people that the cup holder is not great, and the rear visibility takes getting use to, but the one thing that bothers me is the fuel economy.  First, it uses premium fuel, second, it goes through gas very fast....however, that might have something to do with my lead foot, but i can't help it driving this car....in all, i love it and it get noticed...in a good way."

It's definitely a head turner. It's fun to drive, very fast, and very quick. It corners like a dream. The only thing I'd change about it is the cup holder...too small, and a little better gas mileage. But it doesn't do too bad. About 22mpg. Chrysler's biggest mistake w/ this car was not advertising it very well. I think that most people are intimidated by it's looks and think that it must be way out of their price league w/o even checking it out."

The handling is great, and it's very comfortable on long drives.  I have had the car for 2 years and I haven't even thought of dirving anything else.  I love the interior and the exterior design.  Overall the performance is great and I would highly recommend your readers to take one for a drive.  But, be careful, as you may end up buying one!"
chrysler,crossfire,2005,boeroboy, 03/23/2011,"Fun and rare, but buyer beware.",4,"Basically an affordable variation on the Mercedes SLK.
Fun to drive with top down on a nice summer day.
Six speed manual is smooth, but could be geared a little better for fuel (gear 6 in the manual is actually lower than gear 5 in the auto for some sad reason).
Fuel economy in my experience is 28-34 mpg.

Just beware that most ""Chrysler"" parts in this vehicle are just Mercedes parts with a Chrysler sticker and a massive markup.
Remember the Crossfire was a lovechild of Daimler/Chrysler and is no longer made.
If you buy one, be sure to join the Crossfire owner club/forum for help since most dealers don't remember what to do for Crossfire service besides take your money."

My times were consistent, the SRT-8 ran a 14.6 at 97 mph. There is just pure fun and excitement driving my SRT-6 on or off the track. It looks good, it turns heads. I will admit that I wish there were more interior features like a n MP3 player, but then again it was a 2005 model. I got my SRT-6 for half the price, brand new with only 63 miles.

It has only needed oil changes. Mine has only 34,000km, not miles, on it...so about 20,000 miles. Not only is it fun to drive but I get compliments on it wherever I go. People want to know what it is! I think Chrysler/Daimler made a big mistake when they quit making these cars, but on the other hand, mine is or will be a collector car. It is in excellent condition and it is better looking and faster than anything on the road. It was made in Germany and can do the autobahn with speed and agility. I'd buy two of these cute cars if I could afford to. They are great cars! Good on gas too."

chrysler,crossfire,2005,Mark Crossfire, 11/11/2018,Love my Crossfire but...,4,"The Crossfire is based on the long-in-the tooth Mercedes 320 SLK, and has the same virtues and vices. Expect relatively high maintenance costs (just like with the MB). Others have reported the usual suspects, including sticky key, TPS, several twerky sensors, and inevitable oil leaks. If you buy the Roadster know the rear window will fall out, and the hydraulics are very $$$. Do not buy a roadster unless the window has been reglued and the hydraulic cylinders replaced or plan for an unavoidable expensive repair (or seriously negotiate on the price). Center-line handling is bad due to obsolete design. The interior has too much plastic, and the radio and GPS is, as to be expected, pretty outdated. Many Crossfires are higher mileage so expect leaks with gaskets, main oil seal, engine mounts, and transmission mounts. Now the good news... maintenance is very Mercedes-like and can be predicted. The car is still a head-turner, and I find the 215 hp sufficient for normal road use and has surprising acceleration due to light weight.  Grip is phenomenal, especially with good summer tires, and nothing beats driving with the top down. I put a Magnaflow cat-back on mine and it sounds awesome. The seats are good and have the usual adjustments. Treat the Crossfire with some TLC and you'll get many happy miles out of the vehicle. This is a car for the love of driving without breaking the bank (except for maintenance), and is meant to cruise with someone at your side.

I know a lot of people who also use them as a daily driver, but I don't trust the other people on the roads enough.  This is a head turner .... I get so many stares that it is almost embarrassing.  Right after I got it, I walked out of a take out place to see a group of people gathered around my car.  My heart plummeted - I was sure it had been hit.  As it turns out, a crowd of people just wanted to stand around a look at it.  That will make you smile every day."

The Mercedes engine gives it wonderful power and ""super get up and gone"".  The Mercedes suspension handling is first-class and the ride is always a thrill. Lots of sensors, 3 braking systems, 18 and 19 inch tires, beautiful looking engine and a sexy as heck exterior design.  And with all that, it is a totally fun car to drive.  Try one and see.   "
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Jaybird777, 11/11/2009,Incredible car,4,"This car has unbelievable power. Power off the line is tremendous, and faster than most other cars on the road. But on the highway, this car is a madman. At 80 mph on the highway, punch it and you better hold on, and that's no exaggeration. It is scary fast. Muscle car fast.  Quality is also superb. As other reviewers have stated, the car leaves you with no doubt that it is a high end Mercedes. If you can find one, buy it now- they are silly cheap for what you get. These will be collector's items- there is no doubt in my mind. But, they'll have to wrestle it away from me!  Some say the ride is bad- I disagree. It's a sports car. Ride is really pretty great. Worth every dime. "
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Jamil, 12/27/2015,What a sleeper.,5,"This car is amazing. So this is my third car and I'm 21 so best of believe I race my srt6 ever now and then. I have beaten 2015 mustang gt, 2015 camaro ss, audi, 2014 dodge challenger and charger r/t and I'm pretty sure down the line even more. This is a 10 going on11 year old car beating newer cars like it's nothing. I really don't believe this car is really only putting out 330 hp and 310 torque. I know it's a mercedes amg engine and there numbers are different but wow this car is beating 400 hp cars. My favorite part is it keeps pulling and pulling and I have gotten up to 160. I would never trade this car in and I'm definitely going to do some mods later down the road but all I have to say is I'm in love with this sleeper.

chrysler,crossfire,2005,triplefire, 03/02/2009,Buyer Beware,3,"Bought this car confidently after reading so many positive reviews. Purchased Certified used from Chrysler with 38400 miles. Love the styling and handling, especially the two tone interior. However, within 2 days, I noticed a VERY annoying rattling coming from the panel behind the seats/ tonneau cover. Within one week the GPS Navigation stopped functioning. Within a week and a half, I found oil leaking from the rear of the car and the lights are dimming and getting brighter while idling. I thought this was supposed to be a CERTIFIED vehicle! Don't be fooled by Chrysler's so-called Certified Used program... "
chrysler,crossfire,2005,catlady, 04/04/2007,All Flash,2,"The Crossfire may be cute and look fun, but underneath the hood there is a significant lack of torque, and inside, the seats are just short of back breaking. I bought the car with 5,600 miles on it and was told the woman who traded it in had a bad back. Now I do too. I had a Nissan 350Z and there is absolutely no comparison between the two cars in performance or comfort. The trunk is useless too. Opening is so narrow it's difficult to get anything larger than a shoebox in. I've also had to have two new stereo's put in because of the skipping CD player. Get a Z."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Mark V, 07/02/2018,An unknown gem,5,"I like owning a fun car, and the Crossfire certainly qualifies.  It is sporty, nimble and gorgeous.  It gets lots of attention since nobody knows what it is.  What it is is a re-skinned Mercedes SLK  turned into an art deco boat-tail roadster.  It is also mechanically bullet proof and cheap enough to have worked on.  thee cars are getting harder and to find.  I recently added a Crossfire coupe SRT6 to my collection.  It has a 330 Horse power AMG hand built engine...talk about FUN!

chrysler,crossfire,2005,gregtwelve, 07/27/2008,A great sports car,4,"I bought this car 2 years old with 3000 miles on it for half of the sticker. I was looking at used corvettes. I couldn't be more pleased with the purchase. It out accelerates 99% of the all cars on the road, looks incredible and gets decent gas mileage. I would have preferred a manual transmission but the Mercedes 5 speed tap shift auto is excellent. Handles great. Only downside is a stiff ride over bad pavement. As long as the road is decent it is not an issue. I plan to keep it a long time. I have yet to see another Crossfire srt-6 in over a year of ownership, and have only seen a total of 2 or 3 Crossfires on the road in that time. I love that exclusiveness."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,RON, 05/07/2009,MY TOY,4,"I bought this just for a summer toy. It's a blast to drvie and I get (nice car) everytime I'm out. People always stop to stare. I have got over 30mpg at times. It has only has 16000 miles on it and not one problem. It rides a little rough but we don't have the best roads in Ohio. The 19"" wheels and low pro tires makes cornering fantastic. The interior is a little tight but I'm 6ft and 215 lbs. Probably a little large for any two seater. But it was affordable and with the top down,it's just as desirable as any other 2-seat sports car out there."

One ragtop one coupe. The crossfire is an amazing car. It's very solid & drives incredibly. It's also better looking & faster than 95% of the cars on the road. Fit & finish need attention! Rust issues MUST be dealt with. Troubled areas are bottom of the doors (because the weather stripping holds water in, instead of letting it drain) & under the wing mounts. BARE METAL...Really? Daimler???? Other than that the car is awesome! I'm a Chrysler man & although this isn't really a Mopar, it was a complete Chrysler design & concept. Unfortunately, Daimler never advertised it,

Before buying check on price of oil-change and tire replacement.  The 19 inchers in the rear are not only hard to find, but will require you to get a second job to pay for replacements.  It's an ego booster to have the kid at the drive-thru say ""cool car,"" but you pay for the opportunity.  Make sure your local dealer knows how fix them.

About a week ago I found a clean 2005 example with 26K miles for $16K. It is smooth, well-balanced, fast enough, and purrs like the old Triumphs-as least from my memory! I share it with my wife (have to decide between it and a MB CLK500...a tough choice let me tell you!). The styling is so distinctive, and the chassis is solid enough for fast curves, yet the ride is actually quite smooth overall. If you are considering a Mercedes SLK, try out a used Crossfire. It is its fraternal twin for less $$$."

Lots of power under the hood with 320 SLK engine, light weight body and wide tires. I could easily cruise from 50 to 100 mile an hours in 3 seconds and yet the engine still has plenty of horse power underneath the hood. I try 130 mph already and feel like I am cruising at 75 mph. I ready feel that this car can out perform the 350z in acceleration. For those of you that may be interested in the sport cars, should go out and test drive the 350Z, BMW Z4, and the 2003 Corvette.

Bought it with 3k miles for $29k.  Have the SRT-6 version.  Took the wing off (I'm 50, and thought it looked silly with that large wing).  It really is a blast to drive, but watch OUT for those potholes - it drives really rough.  Wish it had ""tunable"" suspension like I hear the corvettes have, or SOME cushioning in the seats from the road.  Gets LOTS of looks, like folks say!  Only had it a few months, so don't know about reliability.  Also wish it had more places to store ""junk"" stuff (those rope-style holders on the door are pretty useless).  "

If I had another mile of road it would have broken 150. Stable as an arrow, and the delightfully furious muted exhaust tone was music in my ears.

The Crossfire is not at the same level as the Z3, but it is great fun, and such an unique design.  Definitely NOT just another boring plain vanilla that makes up the bulk of cars on the road. Plus, because the basic chassis & engine is from Mercedes (when they were still married to Chrysler), it drives solid as can be.  Wife likes the auto transmission, and I love the fact that I can use it as a manual whenever I want to. And the ""trunk"" is way bigger than most roadsters out there.  "
chrysler,crossfire,2005,James Werstak, 11/29/2008,Love this car,4,I have owned my Crossfire convertible for 3 1/2 years and still love to drive it. The only drawback is first gear on the manual transmission which is way too low. From second gear on up it runs strong. The original Continental tires drum and hum right around 17- 20 mph. and OK after that. I have had them trued and rebalanced which helped for a short while. They will soon be replaced with a different top name manufacturer.  Gonna keep cruising with the top down!

When I gave it back I actually purchased 2 SRT-6 crossfires because I was so impressed with the 1st one. The SRT-6 crossfires are awesome vehicles. They have the sharpest styling on any car I've ever seen. Chrysler always has great designers. The underspinnings are Daimler, and feel solid and ride with quality. You can't go wrong with these cars. Also with less than 2000 SRT-6 versions made of the coupe and ragtop, they will be worth money someday. I highly recommend this car!"

The SRT- 6 Roadster is one of the coolest cars that you will ever see, if you will see one at all. Only 928 SRT-6 Roadsters were built world-wide in one year only. This gem of a sportscar is just what I needed. It runs and handles great. The stiff ride is part of the high performance package. So if you need a softer ride, buy the base or limited model. The sticker states that this car has 90% German parts, all Mercedes. Great car for sure. It will only see sunny days."

However, with 48 year old ankles, I never wanted a stick version of a vehicle, so this ""AutoStick only"" is just fine with me. The sound system is superb and the 18-19 tires command attention. Needless to say the sleek and paint job have turned some heads already and the whale tail makes me feel like a proud Jonah!  The mileage is better than my old Ranger. Blind spots? I don't intend to be driving this vehicle in reverse, so I know I will be just fine.  More on it, later"

Just change the pulley right in front, increase the air flow a bit, hook it up to a laptop to change a few parameters and you'll be pushing 390 horses and 200 mph in a flash. And the car will handle like its doing 50 mph.  That's 4.8, 0 -60. Low 13's in the quarter.

Gas economy is acceptable for it's pickup and speed. I get more compliments on it's appearance. I'm very impressed w/ its storage capacity. I live in Florida and love the a/c system in it...cools down FAST! I was specifically looking for a 2-seater now that the kids are driving and this has been a stellar purchase.

The long nose and grooved hood is the cooless!  The spine that follows the entire length fo the car (inside & out) is just like the early Stingray, minus the split window.

I have owned 2 different Chryslers before and had so many of the lot problems before, so I took a chance this time around. And I am still grining from ear to ear about it. This baby is fast, smooth, roomy, and even gets decent MPG. So far I have averaged around 17-18 city, and a solid 28 on the highway. Man, this is one car I pray Chrysler does not drop.

chrysler,crossfire,2005,YoungFellah, 10/04/2006,Bang for the Buck,4,"One of the biggest complaints about this car has been a result of the competition which surrounds it in that mid $30,000 price bracket.  You have BMW coupes, the 350Z, the G35 coupe, the S2000, to name a few.  And those cars are phenomenal in their own rights.  But I got my Crossfire for about $20,000, and it wasn't even a year old.  And be fair, which of these cars looks the most exotic? I think that as good as the other cars look, the Crossfire is in a different class. And it is fast enough.  The Mercedes 3.2L motor that's under the hood is low on BHP, but it has a fat torque curve that really starts stomping at 3000 rpms. 6.1 0-60 seems good.  And the exhaust note! "

That is not a problem with the SRT-6 with silky- smooth 330 BHP supercharged V6 - Daimler/Chrysler should have kept the AMG nameplate on the engine.  The car is really quick and, because of the suspension and braking upgrades, handles much better than the conventional Crossfire. I was worried about the ""rough ride"" described by numerous reviewers, but have not found that to be the case.  Overall, a great car for the price ($29k - brand new).     "

If you are taller then 5'8"" and portly look out, the cabin is tight and leg room limited. But when you want some fun, disengage the traction control and grab some throttle."

It's fast, it's elegant, and it's a head turner almost everywhere I go with it.  My only gripe with the car is that it was only available as a 5-speed automatic with AutoStick.  I feel that a manufacturer of a true sports car would give buyers the option of purchasing such a car with a manual transmission primarily, and possibly offering an automatic transmission.  Unfortunately because this is an Mercedes-Benz AMG at heart, it is only offered as an automatic.  Otherwise, the car is a blast to drive and definitely a conversion starter.  I would recommend getting one!"

He wanted a Crossfire since he moved in with me in - 2005 - the same year as the car. We absolutely LOVE it!  We got black with a black roof with the two tone gray leather interior and it is so slick looking.  Kids on bikes yell, ""NICE CAR!"" when we drive by.  Old men stare at it when we are at a stop sign.    The first thing I noticed when I drove it was how tight the steering was. Then I noticed how the car really clings to the road - it is amazing.  I have no complaints although we've only owned it for 3 whole days :-)  I feel like a superstar when I'm driving it!"

If you buy, be prepared to be stared at. People will break their neck for a look.  I purchased in Houston at $15,000 off the sticker for a new car with 90 miles on the odometer and full factory warranty.  My wife and I broke it in on a 600 mile roadtrip from Houston to Amarillo. The car handled beautifully and was actually much more comfortable than expected.  On cruise control, the car easily handled the hills with no downshift ever.  Passing capability is awesome.  Negatives so far; very stiff suspension, limited rear view and the dang cupholder.  "
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Chris Vann, 09/30/2017,Stevie Ray Vaughan would love this car,5,"Caught in the Crossfire... those words have been playing repeatedly along with the heavily blues laden guitar riffs of the great Stevie Ray Vaughan. I bought this car to replace a well worn Toyota Highlander. I wanted something fun to drive and a C5 or C6 Corvette was just out of range for my cash on hand. I happily stumbled across a 2004 Crossfire in Amethyst Silver metallic and fell in love immediately.  She used to be somebody's baby, and was turned out of her warm garage into the harsh desert sun for unknown shortcomings. They must have just fallen out of love, hey, it happens. She was dirty, her boot filled with the random flotsam and jetsam of life including uncashed checks and dirty socks. A few hours of derailed cleaning, a good scrubbing, and she was shining like a diamond in a goats ass. She just needed someone to love her again and she has responded accordingly. This car is truly a blast to drive. The 6 speed transmission is easy to work, clutch throw and pressure are exactly right on and the cockpit is laid out finer than your church clothes on a Saturday night. It is my first German car I have ever owned and it just makes sense, frightening really how much it makes sense. The only drawback I have discovered this far is my golf clubs do not fit in the boot. I have not come up with a solution, I'm considering building a small trailer that looks like mini Crossfire that would hold my clubs, cool and functional. I am averaging 25.8 mpg with the a/c on full blast, and a couple of quick jaunts at just over the speed limit. I do recommend using the cruise control on the highway, it is way too easy to lose yourself in the guitar riffs coming out of the speakers and allow your right foot to rest heavily on the responsive accelerator.             Day by day,night after night,
Blinded by the neon lights.
Hurry here, hustlin' there,
No one's got the time to spare.
Money's tight, nothin' free,
Won't somebody come and rescue me?
I am stranded, caught in the crossfire
Stranded, caught in the crossfire.

Tooth for tooth, eye for an eye.
Sell your soul just to buy, buy, buy.
Beggin' a dollar, stealin' a dime,
Come on can't you see that I
I am stranded ,caught in the crossfire
I am stranded, caught in the crossfire.

I need some kind of kindness, some kind of sympathy oh, no
We're stranded, caught in the crossfire

Save the strong lose the weak,
Never turning the other cheek.
Trust nobody don't be no fool,
Whatever happened to the golden rule?
We got stranded, caught in the crossfire
We got stranded, caught in the crossfire
We got stranded, caught in the crossfire

chrysler,crossfire,2005,xfiretampa, 12/18/2007,Love It,4,It was my dream car and luckily I was patient & was able to purchase exactly what I wanted! Very fun car to drive. People can't keep their eyes off of it. Hopefully will upgrade to the SRT in a couple of years!
chrysler,crossfire,2005,dejohnny, 12/18/2007,They don't know how good it is!,4,"Hands down, this is the best car I've owned. AMG tuning and Chrysler styling, what a combination! The car is just awsome."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,GGGUY, 12/01/2008,Love my Crossfire,4,"Bought my Crossfire Limited Roadster a few months ago. Car had 13,000 miles and cost 17,600.00 after a little haggling. My old car was a 1997 Mazda Miata. What a difference. The Crossfire looks better, rides better, gets good gas mileage and could blow the doors off the Miata. Can't wait til spring. It's cold and slippery here in the great white north. Crossfires are not winter cars. "
chrysler,crossfire,2005,vegas , 03/09/2009,great car,5,have had  2 corvettes . they may be quicker but no where near the quality of this crossfire . get fantastic mileage on the hwy and around town . this was chryslers hidden secret . what do you need more speed for this is the usa no audoban here  . very cofortable and very quick . didn't have to pay over 40 thou to pass everything except a gas station .really fun car will keep minr forever until it becomes a collector . then you can all eat your heart out . no need for more speed her have more than enough . chrysler should make more of these 
chrysler,crossfire,2005,CrossfireChick, 06/28/2009,Fun!,4,"I've been wanting a convertible for a while. I was waiting to buy my Corvette but this car caught my eye. It's sexy, fun and incredible to drive. I love the stares as I'm driving or parked. On warm sunny FL days, going topless (the car, not me) is incredible. Super fun! Hope to keep this car for a long time."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,R Frye, 06/10/2005,CROSSFUNER,3,"Wife and I bolth fell in love with design  Bought it just for fun car and it is all of that,and more. Added bonus is we live not far from wine country , in any direction. We found with top down trunk holds overnite stuff plus two cases of wine. With top up five cases So we are looking foward to driving all summer."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Ebody, 06/29/2005,Crossfire is little known gem,5,"I just got a 2005 Limited Coupe after searching car dealers for 6 months for the ""right car"". I looked at BMW 3 Series Coupe, Mini Cooper S Conv, Caddy CTS, Corvette, G35 Coupe, 350Z and Boxster.  With the rebates, the Crossfire had the right mix of price, comfort, sporty (always wanted a 2 seater), insurance cost, gas mileage, power and off course, handling. It gets almost as many looks and questions as my PT Cruiser did when it was new. The car rides great, my wife and I actually slept in the passenger's side during our trip to Florida when we switched off driving.  The crisp handling saved our life by avoiding a vehicle that cut in front of us on interstate road construction."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Lee, 07/09/2005,My dream car,4,I love this baby!   I even had a policeman stop me and tell me what a great looking hot car this was!  This car rides like a dream. Very comfortable seats and lots of bells and whistles to play with.  Only drawback is no trunk space....maybe just enough to put in a small overnight duffle bag.   This is one great hot car!!!!
chrysler,crossfire,2005,joe faughnan, 08/16/2005,Great Car,4,"This is a fun car to drive and it really turn the heads of people that are standing on the side of the road or in vehicle we pass. Every time I have to get gas, some other driver almost always asks for a ""tour"" of this vehicle. Very distinctive design that I still get positive comments on. Some folks in the trade magazines have complained that the motor is ""too small"", yet this car has been driven above 145 mph. I don't know how much bigger an engine is needed. There has never been a mechanical problem with this car. It was recalled once for a new radio with a better display screen, as the original one ""washed out"" in the sunlight. All this and a 70,000 mile/7 year warranty."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Art in CT, 09/10/2005,No Wires Crossed,5,The Crossfire is a wonderful blend of sports car and sports coupe.  The performance is very good with ride and handling being in the firm and controlable area.  The styling is well... you either like it or you do not.  I am constantly getting inquiries and thumbs up from folks on the road and in parking situations.  The 6 speed manual is fun to drive and the gearbox is very nice.  I have about 11000 mile on the car now and have not had a single issue or problem.  So I would rate the build quality as excellent.  I have added a clear shield aftermarket bra to the front of the car to stop rock dings.  Downside of the car is when you are backing out of a parking place.  Vision is limited.  
chrysler,crossfire,2005,George E. Murphy, 10/09/2005,Car Of My Teenage Dreams,5,"I can recall reading Road & Track as a teenager when I was supposed to be doing homework; all I wanted in life was one of those beautiful touring cars. I have gone through my share of economy, functional, mini-van types and finally I have my car of my 14 year old dreams. Chiropracters should thank all of us for the way for the way it twists necks. I had a Porsche driver pull next to me on the highway and give me/it a thumbs up! I love everything about it, acceleration, comfort, handling and particularly styling. I had to wait until I was 65, but it was worth the wait! "
chrysler,crossfire,2005,J Santiago, 11/04/2005,11000 Miles in 6 Months!,5,"Wow! I drove 11,000 Miles in 6 months! Had a ball driving every mile of it. Drove it to Chicago & Nobody had my car (they all had imports that cost double!) But it turned heads, even when my car was dirty with all the brake dust. Thought about getting the 6spd, but didn't think that was too practical-got the autostick, gives u control when u want it. The auto drop- top is awesome.Interior is super sharp (vanilla & black leather)& the free luggage was a great bonus! Don't miss the lack of trunk space, (that's why I have a dodge dakota too)the sound system is great w/subwoofers.My only complaint is that darn cupholder.You need a spill proof mug if u are drinking coffee.I love it!Funnest car ever"
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Brian, 03/11/2006,Love My Xfi!,4,"I had previously looked at them upon release but decided the price was a little too much.  I JUMPED at the chance when the emp price was released on them.  This car is almost perfect.  There aren't many in my area, so naturally everyone stares and asks me about it constantly.  I cannot goto a gas station without someone talking to me about it.   I demo'd an s2000, rx8 and a 350z before buying and decided on the smoother ride over that slight more power the 350 had.  I can say this is a luxury sports car without hesitation.  The service is a little pricey on the car, dont let a salesman fool you.  I nearly died when I got a $125 oil change bill.  (9qt synth and MB filter)"

chrysler,crossfire,2005,Xfire Lover, 06/20/2006,Good For What it is,4,"For the price and what you get, this is hands down the best-bargain 2 seater luxury coupe on the market.  For $26,000 or less you get a mercedes in mercedes clothing. You will either love or hate this car.  I love it.  You might too.  Definitely take it for a test drive.  Warning: More likely than not, you'll end up buying the car after the test- drive. "
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Joseph A. Millikan, 07/10/2004,Dream Car,5,"I simply can't tell you how much I 
enjoy my Crossfire.  It's a peppy car 
with classic looks and really makes 
driving a pleasure.  It's fun to turn 
heads when I drive past them.  
Especially nice is the automatic 
spoiler which raises around 65 mph and 
lowers at about 35 mph.  I have the 
silver blue model and it's a charm."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,jps, 11/16/2004,Better than my Porsches,5,"Believe it,  I have owned three 
Porsche 911's and this Crossfire has 
garnered more looks, great 
questions,and more enthusiasm than any 
car I have previously driven.  Even in 
car crazy Los Angeles.  The build 
quality from the Karmann works is 
excellent.  The driving experience is 
just right and the kids and grownups 
keep staring."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Dorothy, 12/18/2004,Luv my Baby,4,"Great Manueverability, fun and sporty, 
this is a great car to drive.  I get 
questions and receive comments from 
other people all the time.  There is 
only one thing I would change and that 
is the cup holder, it is not driver 
friendly and has broken once already.  
Otherwise it is a great investment."

standpoint, as well as from a quality 
ride. Great modern appointments on the

the bar high for this collaboration. A 
real pleaser - through and through."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Faith, 06/18/2005,My Yellow convertible,4,"My husband surprised me with this yellow crossfire convertible..which I love. It is the perfect size, has great speed, is fun to drive, and I get many compliments as well as inquiries about it. We plan to pay it off and it is a keeper. I like how it handles, the gas mileage is great..and we have taken it on some  fun trips."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,jag21082, 10/15/2005,Fantastic Purchase,4,"I was concerned when buying this car about the space issue, being 6'2, but I found that since I drive by myself, it hasn't been a problem.  I love the way the car looks and even getting compliments in car crazy LA. The performance is more than adequate for city driving, and the car feels like a tank on the freeways.  The seats in the car are superb, and the stereo begs to be turned up even louder.  The manual tranny is very slick, despite reading negative reviews from various sources. I haven't put too many miles on the car yet, but with a tick over 4,000, the car feels very solid, no rattles or issues.  The air conditioning works extremely well, and the heated seats are a nice touch!"
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Keith, 11/27/2005,Traded in my Jaguar for Crossfire!,5,"I bought this car and traded in my leased Jaguar 4 months early!  I was debating between a BWM z4 or the crossfire.  I am sooo happy with my choice.  The car is great from looks to driving.  I get a lot of comments and looks.  The top down makes this car look like a million dollars.  In fact, most people who ask what kind of car it is ask ""did you pay about $50k?""  I plan on keeping this one a long time."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Bob Komoroski, 03/31/2006,A Real Fun Car,4,This is one of the best sports cars that I have ever owned.  The only disapointment is the poor cheap cupholder in the center arm rest.  The pick up on the car is very nice and the exterior design superior. Glad I made the purchase when I did. 
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Fort Laud SRT6, 10/08/2006,My first sports car!!!,4,"I've owned a black SRT6 for about 2.5 months now. I bought it as a weekend/fun car. Despite only coming in an auto tranny, this car will satisfy the power hungry... believe me. Friends that have ridden with me (and the few close friends who I trusted to give it a test drive) commented on the rapid acceleration, smooth shifting auto tranny & great handling/traction. It pulls hard & upshifts from 3rd to 4th around 105 or so at full throttle. Trust what the reviews say about it & ignore the very few negative reviews because it's a superb performer. Also, consumers held off on buying these at an unfair 45K so they can be had for a reasonable 30-35K w/low milage!! I paid $30,600 w/3400 miles!!!"
chrysler,crossfire,2005,SRT-6, 11/04/2006,Great car except fuel,4,"I purchased my Crossfire in May. It is able to drive for everyday use but only for the riches, because the fuel consumption is less more than 17 L/100 km."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,wyrfox, 11/16/2007,A better looking MB-SLK!,4,"After careful looking and research, the option of getting MB's engineering and Chrysler's art deco styling was too compelling. I found my Xfire on Craiglist and it was love at first sight. The car is fun to drive, gets great milage (27-29 HWY) and as the Caddy ads say, ""the car returns the favor!"" Bit of warning, the dealerships are flakey with only a few Xfire trained techs, but the private MB folks around will understand every aspect of the car. An Mopar will sell parts to anyone. "
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Brian, 05/25/2018,A Bit Outdated,5,"All Crossfires are a bit outdated in terms of technology unless you upgrade the infotainment system. The SR-6 is wicked fast.. Loved the whine of the supercharged engine!!!

This two seater is also a head turner and I am constantly getting thumbs ups and questions about the car.  The Crossfire is built at the Karman plan by Mercedes and sold in the USA by Chrysler.  The six speed manual is crisp and short throw make it a joy to drive. The brakes are excellent.

There are many excellent machines out there, but all contenders were dismissed as ""too"" harsh, cramped expensive, etc..  The srt-6 roadster was the best fit with our needs. Comfortable, sufficeint space and plenty sporty. We got a great deal by bringing prices of vehicles that have sold on eBay and those listed in cars.com. We negotiated up from these prices rather than down from list. A phenomenal backroad car that I would highly recommend."

Once I found just the right way to turn the handle, it worked like a charm.  Cruise control lever gets in the way of turn signals. Also when using cruise control it does not keep the same speed when going up hills. Needs premium fuel so make sure you have plenty of cash.  Although a summer car, it was not bad in snow with the traction control and antilock breaks especially in the mountains of VA.  Very nice pick up for the base V6.  I am sure the SRT-6 would be radically faster.  I also like the speed shift automatic.  It gives more pickup faster when engaged... just make sure you remember to change gears!"
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Tim Gordon, 06/02/2005,enjoy,4,"This nimble little car is not only comfortable with terrific handling, but is certainly a head-turner with it's retro design. I always get a lot or praise on its looks.."

chrysler,crossfire,2005,david, 03/30/2005,Rear view restriction,4,The design of the rear window and or either back side window is limited because of their narrowness.  When making a left turn the driver has to reach back over his shoulder and strain for a clearance view of on coming traffic. Also in parking lots the visual is greatly restricted and one must be careful in backing up.

chrysler,crossfire,2005,Alan, 05/01/2005,2005 Crossfire,4,"I feel that the Crossfire is one of the Best built cars on the road today. It is solid, well built, everything matches up, nothing miss aligned.  It handles the road like no other. The only thing they could have done to make it better, is to make a little more room for us tall people. I am 6'3"" and it is a little close.  "
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Robert Barclay, 05/16/2005,"Crossfire Review, 2005",4,"The only drawback is that can't carry anything in the car, not even golf clubs (have to put in front seat).  fantastic car to drive.  I have people constantly come up and admire the car."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,david macdonald, 05/16/2005,cool ride,4,"I simply love this car, it rides smooth and quiet, has plenty of power, get more attention than I need or want. Talk about a chick magnent! The top works smooth and with no effort.The sound system is great!"
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Bridge, 06/02/2005,Lots of Looks,5,"My Crossifre Roadster is an amazing car. It is my ""mid life ENTITLEMENT"" car! People actually go out of their way to tell me how beautiful the car is. I is fun to drive, and very comfortable. The seats are great for my back. I just wish the cup holder was larger and the navigation system was a little easier to use. My wife thinks the luggage is an amazing feature."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Mike M, 06/10/2005,The best car decision I ever made.,5,"This is my first sports car, and I am really glad I purchased this model. I have never had so many people stop me and talk about the car. Great performance on both winding roads and straight out on the highway. I now look forward to the long trips across Northern Nevada. Catch me if you can."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,<3mycrossfire, 06/10/2005,<3mycrossfire,4,"I honestly love my crossfire, I owned a Jetta before this, so I am used to the German drive, but was wanting something different without sacrificing quality, and this is it... I also own an Escalade, and love the American handling, this is the perfect fusion of both. One of the most comfortable interiors as well... "
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Happy in Dallas, 06/10/2005,Fun!,5,"This is the most fun I have had since I drove an SL in the mid 80's.  The performance is great, but what do you expect from a car built in Germany.  The style is so much better than the SLK, and it's basically the same car.  I get compliments and questions about it almost daily.  It handles well on the road and gets reasonable gas mileage."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Peggy, 06/11/2005,"Second Childhood Fun, Fun, Fun!!!!!!",4,"After reading about this ""Spec"" model at an auto show in early 2000 or so, I thought....if this ever comes to fruition, I must investigate!!  Well, to make a long story short...It did. I investigated. I fell in love.  The romance is still going strong!!! I am an older ""cool"" woman (as my Grandchildren call me) who has always had a love for cars that was instilled in me by my ""sonless father""! I was very fortunate and at this point in my life having the time of my life with the Crossfire as a sidekick!! The biggest thrill is the manual handling...making me truly feel a  ""part"" of the whole process.  (The quick glances that come my way aren't so bad either!!!! I feel l9 again!!!!!!"
chrysler,crossfire,2005,bboop1956, 06/12/2005,our crossfire,4,"we just bought our crossfire. SO far so good,, we LUV it, its a fun car to drive and you get alot of looks in it,, its just a sharp looking little sports car, plenty of leg room. its great having the top down. the top is easy to put down also.  the only thing i dont like is when the top is up u do have a bad blind spot so you do have to be careful. not sure if a person taller than 6-5 would like it,, my son is 6-4 and the top of the windsheild is at his eye level.its just an all around nice car"
chrysler,crossfire,2005,jbjtkbw00, 06/13/2005,Oh my...,4,"While not my first two seater (I've had to very fun to drive Honda CRX's), this is definitely the most fun and quickest that I've ever owned.   Yes, I'm a new owner, but I've put a few hundred miles on it in just over 24 hours because I just had to drive it all over Orlando.  This car turns heads and gets me the looks.  The lines are so smooth on this car and anyone that appreciates the classics should love the trim on this baby.  The engine has a low lion's growl to it. Not as storng as a Viper, but it's right there.  Tight on corners and quick from the stoplight.  I hope to return to update this review in a few months.  Don't miss out on this car!!!"
chrysler,crossfire,2005,T. Gordon, 06/14/2005,hot number,4,"This car is truly a good performance car...good acceleration, excellent handling and a favorite of the CHP I am certain..."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Matt M TX, 07/10/2005,1 year and still loving it!,4,"The styling of these cars is what drew me to them. I always get compliments everywhere I go and you don't see too many of them around so they stand out.  The engine is smooth with a nice broad torque band and decent power. The car begs to be driven fast so I do wish there was more on tap but still not bad.  The interior is not for everyone. I find it cozy but some may find it cramped. The car sits low so plan on a bit of climbing to get in the door. The fit and finish is great and the materials look good.  The convertible top is high quality and surprisingly quiet.  My first year has been a joy. This car exudes fun with a nearly perfect balance of performance, comfort, and economy."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Zach, 07/22/2005,Fun to drive,4,"This car is a eye turner, and it performs just as good as it looks. The cup holder is a waste, needs a better location"
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Max, 08/13/2005,Second Childhood/ Age 65,5,"I have 4,000 miles on the car, mostly in the neighborhood.. I feel like a ""traveling"" sales person for chrysler! Everyone wants to chat about the car!!  The crossfire luggage was an unexpected bonus, although the roll- about wont fit the trunk!"
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Cobra953, 08/14/2005,Outstanding Car....,5,"This is an outstanding, but underrated car. Of course the positive side to this is the fact there are not many on the road, so you don't see yourself coming and going. 5800 miles, no squeaks, rattles or other problems. One trip to the dealer for an early oil change ($24.00 with my oil). Just bought the extended bumper to bumper warranty from Chrysler for 7/100,000 miles. This is a keeper!!"
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Nicole, 09/10/2005,I love my Crossfire,4,The style of the car is great! People walking by give me the thumbs up. Daily people comment me on my car.  You just feel good when you're driving. It is a so much fun to drive.  I think that the style is going to age well.
chrysler,crossfire,2005,dobro, 09/25/2005,I Ain't never had Too Much Fun !,4,"Roadsters are for FUN, period.  I've owned MGs, a Miata, and have driven a dozen other ragtops,and the Crossfire is the most FUN of them all. As Crossfire demand slackened, I got a screaming deal on a barely used 6 speed Limited Roadster, and I still have to pinch myself to see if I'm dreaming. It's as if a Cadillac had a drunken fling with a Boxter, and the result is this precision German machine wearing a rodeo belt buckle. Great handling, great top mechanism, great stereo, great aesthetics. A keeper."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,I love it!, 11/04/2005,I love it!,5,"I had the opportunity to lease one since I have a family member that works for Chrysler.  I absolutely love it.  The best part is, I'm only 20.  When I first got it, I got nothing but compliments.  People were always asking me about it.  I actually talked to a guy for a half an hour about it since he had just gotten one too.  Being 6'2"" made it a little hard to get used to, but now I have no problem sitting in it.  My brother and I, both of whom are the same height, can fit in it no problem.  Defenitely worth it.  It's my everyday car and I wouldn't want it any other way."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Marc B. Mankuta, 11/05/2005,Exceptionally well made car,4,"This is a Mercedes Benz, in Karmann built, Chrysler clothing. The car looks fantastic, drives beautifully and is one of the best built cars I've owned. The interior materials feel first rate and the convertible top mechanism looks like mechanical ballet going up and down. So far there is nothing I don't like about the car. It is a steal at current market prices. Not a sports car to compete with Corvettes or Porsches on performance but a beautiful, open top, comfortable cruiser to compete or exceed them on all other levels most especially price."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Steve Thompson, 11/21/2005,Fun to Drive Turns heads,5,"Have been looking at this model, as well as the BMW Z4 and the 350Z, for several months. The Crossfire has the best value, with all the great rebates offered by Chrysler. Having lots of fun driving, no problems so far, looks great, and look forward to driving this car each day."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Jaxjr, 12/24/2005,Tremendous Value/ Quality/ Fun to Drive,4,Look up 'Refined' in the dictionary and you'll see Crossfire's picture. This is fully Mercedes and one of their better models. I love to drive and be seen in this beauty. It is a great cruiser with a comfortable ride at 80. The engine is smooth throughout the rpm range. Tiptronic tranny is not good: it is perfect. Tires hold the road is the tightest turns. Fun to drive and fun to find value without overspending. This car is a winner! 
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Ron, 12/24/2005,This is the one,5,"Never have I had so much fun driving a car! Everytime I drive it someone comments, whether it's a ""thumbs-up"" or something else. One of my best purchases!!!!"
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Cobra953, 12/31/2005,Daily driver's can be fun,5,"I have been driving this car everyday for the last 11 months. It's fun, fast, and reliable. I find it can corner with the best of them, and although it is not a HP giant, it will run the interstates and two lanes with power to spare. I have had it back to the dealer twice, for oil changes. That's it. Not a squeak or rattle."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Rick, 01/01/2006,Don't buy one,4,"Fabulous car!!! Please don't buy one. I like being in the minority! Although the hp numbers may not excite you, the styling, handling and actual performance will."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Teresa Meyer, 01/02/2006,Teresa's review,4,"Really a fun car to drive.  Love everything about it except the cup holder and the fact that I can't put my golf clubs in the trunk.  Took a long top-down road trip on a curvy road and it was the greatest fun.  I tested the BMW Z4 before deciding on the Crossfire which is quieter and has a more gentle ride.  Not comfortable driving in the snow, but that was expected, use my SUV for that purpose."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Crossfire Bill, 01/05/2006,What a Car.,5,I bought a Blaze Red Pearlcoat Limited Roadster for myself for Christmas. Quality was excellent. I have had more fun with this car than any other car I have ever had including Mercedes and Toyota sports cars. I would buy another one in a heartbeat.
chrysler,crossfire,2005,bsblair, 01/09/2006,2005 Crossfire Ltd Roadster,4,"Sure is nice to have a car with torque, 2 A4's, turbo 4 w/ quattro, great cars, but no acceleration 0-30.  Bought a roadster, can't wait for warm weather to drop the top.   Room for more ammenities, but that would just drive up the cost. My wife's RX-8 has it beat for handling, but this car is more for cruising, with the top down."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Antonio, 01/09/2006,Eye Appeal,4,"My Crossfire has sure captured the attention of all motorists I have encountered. This vehicle is extremely well built, excellent road handling and fun to drive."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Yuri, 02/06/2006,MerChrysler!,5,"I bought this car after looking at many others such as Mustang GT, G35, 350Z, Audi TT and M-B SLK.  The Crossfire is a far more interesting vehicle and reminds me of nothing else out there is bland car land.  Only the TT has as much chararcter.  It may not be as fast as some of the others, but it has other amazing qualities. I love the look, the ride and the fact that it is not one of 160,000 sold. Quality is amazing since the ""donor"" was an excellent car to begin with. However, the main reason to buy a car such as the Crossfire is the way it looks. This car looks better than many exotics costing 4 times as much.  I love this car and it was flawless in the 15 day Florida trip I took it on!"
chrysler,crossfire,2005,riley34, 02/07/2006,My Crossfire,4,"After approx 4k miles I can say that I am very happy that I purchased this car. The features are great, the ride is styling and the value is unbeatable. A couple of minor items are 1 or 2 more DC connections, radio could be more straightforward to use and a Sirius option would be nice, a spare or ride flat tires and finally some better after market stuff from MOPAR."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Casey, 03/01/2006,Classy,4,"Love it!! Owned 3 Z's but this one tops them all. Classy, Sharp and a Lot of Fun to drive. Feel very safe even though it is small. The luggage is nice too. "
chrysler,crossfire,2005,William, 03/10/2006,Just Plain Great,5,"Saw it...Bought it...could not believe the value, fun and looks...yes a head turner...bought a black on black roadster...drives amazing well...great built car...you know it is a quality drive."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,ek, 03/14/2006,Fresh Yet Classic Styling,5,I enjoy everything about this very uniquely styled fun to drive instant classic. So many other cars look common. This is a special automobile inside and out. Wow! A blast to drive. There is no other car in the world I would rather own.
chrysler,crossfire,2005,joe, 04/08/2006,very happy,4,I have owned a lot of cars but this one is a blast to drive. I am a very happy with this purchase. The top is fast and easy to use.
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Napasonoma, 04/11/2006,This is it!,5,"I have owned this car for 8 months and it has been a blast to drive.  It has great torque and HP.  It's all you need to have to enjoy this size car.  It is not a muscle car but a sports car and can it handle, it is glued to the road.  The quality is German it shows everywhere the fit of pats and the even lines, look under the hood everything is well laid out and uniform.This car turns heads at every intersction."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Wendy Powers, 05/06/2006,Fast and Furious Crossfire - That's Hott,5,"This car has been a pleasure to drive for me. The convertible top goes down with ease and looks stylish in the process. The way you can switch over from automatic to stick shift is also nice for those tight situations. The heated seats work so fast, that is a huge plus! I also received a complimentary Chrysler 3 piece luggage set that fits perfectly in my trunk (it is so cute, the wheels on the luggage are just like my actual car wheels, all chrome and shiny)."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,MARK READER, 05/18/2006,Love my Crossfire,4,This car is fun to drive it's a real head turner when ever we drive it someone always comes up to look at the car or asks what it is. I even had a guy get out at a stop light and ask where we got it.
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Liza, 05/20/2006,Great Car,4,"I love my crossfire!! It is so beautiful, I enjoy looking at it everytime I get in to drive it.  The steering is ultra precise, the interior surfaces are cutting-edge, and the controls are thoughtfully placed! Not to mention the excellent brakes which have reacted well when I needed them to! Good Job Chrysler!"
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Ken C, 05/23/2006,SRT-6 Coupe - A Real Sleeper!!,4,"I purchased my Graphite Metallic SRT-6 7 mos ago. The plan was to buy the SRT- 6, drive it for a couple of years until the price of a used Cayman S got within my range, then sell it and move into the Porsche.  I really underestimated this car! Suspension, handling, acceleration, and build quality have all been tremendous. The more I drive it, the more impressed I am.  I'm not clear why the SRT-6 hasn't gotten more positive press. I guess attention has been more focused on the new Vette and Cayman S. With the incentives available on the SRT-6, the price is below $40K, making the SRT-6 a bargain compared to similar performing 2 seat sports cars.  Like the title says: A Real Sleeper!!"
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Cary, 05/31/2006,Excellent car,4,"My last car before this one was a Porsche 911 so I really didn't expect much when I got behind the wheel. But I was very pleasently surprised by the strong, predictable power band, incredible cornering, excellent braking, and styling that never seems to lose its appeal.  For a small car, it isn't particularly fuel efficient but apart from that, no complaints."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Joni B, 06/01/2006,The best kept secret,4,"This car is a blast to drive and to look at.  It turns heads every time I drive it.  People don't know what it is??  I hardly ever see one on the road.  The performance is very good, love the auto stick.  Inside is very roomy and I do not feel right up against the other person.  Loved the luggage that showed up at our door about a week later, not that I think it will all fit in the trunk.  Love the auto top.  Takes bumps very well.  Love the big wide tires.  Sharp looking car!!!"
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Texan, 06/05/2006,Still Lovin,4,"I was concerned after a while if I would become tired of the design but after two years, I think this is such a cool car.  I have owned Jaguars, Lexus, but nothing htis fun to drive.  I really enjoy it.  People love to look at it and if they only knew how much fun it was to drive."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,joa32649, 06/05/2006,"Fun,and more Fun!",4,"Fun car to drive it feels like you are on rails glued to the road. Tires 18 inch in front and 19 in rear plus traction control and stability control a big plus. Can't wait to try it out in the mountains in West Virgina! The only complaint is the controls and the way they are laid out they could have done a better job! It is a head turner and if you like attention this is the car for you,every time I take it out it draws a crowd. Most people think it is a German or Japanese car. I love the car take one for a test drive and you will want one! Fun,Fun!"
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Don, 07/02/2006,Great car,4,"Great handling on the road, 27.7 miles/gal on trips. 19 mpg in the city if you are conservative in take-a-ways at the lights.  "
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Rick Powell, 07/03/2006,Lost in Love,5,"From the minute I saw this car I had to have it. The lines are better than the more expensive european built sports cars. After driving BMW and Porshe this is a step up. Drop the top and enjoy life. Wish they had been available 20 years ago! Buy one now, you won't be disappointed."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,joe, 07/08/2006,loving it,4,This car is great. I have had it now for a few months and love everytime i get into it. Can't wait to leave work and put the top down. The cup holder is kinda of useless if u ask me but who cares about that really. 
chrysler,crossfire,2005,D. Davis, 07/08/2006,Love my crossfire roadster limited,5,She drives like a dream.  Hugs the curves and has lots of pick up.  I enjoy the sound of the exhaust system.  The top raises or lowers in about 22 seconds. Anyone wishing a fun car for nice days would love the roadster.
chrysler,crossfire,2005,REM, 07/10/2006,The Best of the bunch,4,"I have the car and have had in the past BMW, Corvette, TransAm, Audi to name a few, this has been my favorite. The ride is smooth, choppy, no way, drive the Corvette for that. From my experience driving this car it is put together well and is fun to drive, the pick up is good I have had people eat my dust many times, lol. The navigational system works so I don't know what the hell the idiot that said it didn't do or maybe he should learn to read or follow directions, it gets you any where you want to go, I'll prove it to anyone, I have travel just using the system. If you enjoy driving than this is the car to have and my God every where I go heads turn and they all ask what kind if car it is. "
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Matt from Mass, 07/21/2006,Two Summers and still great,4,Purchased the crossfire in November and stored it for the winter. I have been enjoying the car for two summers now and wouldn't part with it. Milage is better than estimated with the automatic 24-26 city and 32-34 highway and that's at 70+ top up. Corners unbelievably tight. Complaints are the cup holder(why even bother)and the 2 way adjustable passenger seat. (why not make them the same?) The car is still an eye catcher.
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Malesa, 07/25/2006,Fun to Drive,4,"The car itself is awesome. It turns heads everywhere I go. I love the fact that I have a car with so much style. It's a great conversation starter because everyone wants to know more about it. The luggage set received in the mail was a wonderful surprise and it's almost as much fun as the car. While there are a few things that could be improved on, the car is awesome to drive and I would not have picked another convertible in its place."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,SUSIE, 08/04/2006,MYCROSSFIRE,4,"I love to drive my Crossfire with the top down .I get many compliments on what a ""cool"" ride it is.I notice a lot people looking at it and admiring it. I recently moved to  Florida from Michigan (brrrrr)so I will be getting a lot of Quality ""top down"" time all year long.Ilove my shiny Black Ragtop!!!!"

When I first heard that I might actually be able to afford a Mercedes Benz with an American nameplate, I ordered my state-issued ""Crossfire"" personal license plate.  The performance is great, the fuel economy is wonderful, and I get excellent service after the sale.  Mine is a six-speed, and that adds to the fun.  The next stop is Biloxi, Ms, for a weekend of gambling..."

chrysler,crossfire,2005,Philip Smith, 08/18/2006,Best Looking Car in America,4,"I was not in the market for a car when I finally went to see a Crossfire.  I loved the way it looked so much, after test driving it, I did not leave the showroom without one ordered which was delivered that same day. Without a doubt the best looking car designed, and wherever I go people ask me about it, point at it on the road.  A unique design.  All other cars look alike. Crosslfire is fabulous. 32 hiway mpg and 25 average"
chrysler,crossfire,2005,HDReeves, 05/04/2004,US-German Relations,4,"This car is definitely fun to drive, 
especially on winding roads.  It has 
excellent lateral acceleration.  It is 
a little slow in its straight aheas 
acceleration; there is a brief lag 
sudden acceleration while in motion.  I 
have had the car since October, 2003, 
with no mechanical problems.  There is 
not much storage, but plenty of cockpit 
room for sitting.  If you are not 
planning on a lot of luggage, then this 
is a great way to get where you are 
going...or no where in particular, if 
you just want to have some fun."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Jeana1norse, 05/08/2004,Great car,5,"This is a great car all around.  It is 
really more like a Mercedes than a

on the inside.  The performance is 
better than I expected as well."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Scott Rabe, 05/09/2004,My Crossfire is Awsome,4,"The Crossfire looks expensive from the 
exterior and interior and drives like 
an expensive sports car. It is solid 
and effortless to drive on the highway 
and in the city and gets a "" thumbs 
ups"" and looks from people driving both 
very expensive and ordinary cars. The 
low profile tires, the 19 inche wheels 
in the back and 18 inche wheels in the 
front, add so much to the look of the 
car. The speed activated spoiler is a 
feature that makes me smile every time 
it operates. The 215 hp engine propels 
the car very fast for this 62 year old 
male and solid handling on curves is 
again a cause for smiles.

awesome, and is fun all around.  The 
look with the top down is classic and 
clean.  The convertible top is done 
much better than the Viper which is 
twice the price.  Nice gauges and 
quality sound system.  I would like 
more horsepower though.  At 215hp, its 
less than I'm accustomed to in my 
Cadillac CTS (also a fabulous car!).  
Speed lines on the hood are a great 
touch, as well as the 18"" front and 19"" 
rear wheels.  Better rear visibility 
with the top up than the coupe version 
of this car.  Great trunk space with 
the top up, and plenty of room for 
groceries with the top down."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,typool, 07/07/2004,Excellent car,4,"My husband and I waited since last yr 
for this convertible.  Absolutely love 
it!!  Very fun to drive, great 
handling.  We have had people follow us 
to take a closer look.  The kids think 
it's cool because we have had lots of 
honks and whistles.  This is a 
great ""us"" car...no french fries, happy 
meals, softball equipment, etc.  Others 
with convertibles have remarked about 
the hideaway top when it goes down.  
Trunk space is minimal when the top is 
down but hey..who cares!!  Less clothes 
to take for those fun weekend getaways!!"

chrysler,crossfire,2005,a2alicat, 07/28/2004,Amazing Ride!,4,"I've loved this car ever since I saw 
it as a concept at the Detroit Auto 
Show.  It's sleek, sexy, and loads of 
fun to drive.  Handles extremely well, 
especially on curvy mountain roads.  I 
only wish my daily commute included a 
mountain drive!"
chrysler,crossfire,2005,autobuyinghelp, 07/27/2004,A feel good roadster!,4,"Before purchasing my Chrysler Crossfire 
Roadster Limited, I owned a 1995 
Corvette Roadster for the past five 
years. I'd grown very attached to the 
power and handling of Corvette.  After 
test driving both the Honda S2000 and 
Audi TT Roadster, I was convinced that 
I would not be satisfied with anything 
less then a Corvette, but that was only 
until I drove the Crossfire.  Its 
styling and ""high tech"" look first 
attracted me, but it only took a short 
drive to convince me that there was a 
lot more then just its good looks.  It 
certainly is one of the most 
comfortable, fun to drive vehicles that 
I've ever owned.  The V6 Mercedes motor 
is powerful and smooth."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,BearsMom, 08/02/2004,My Ebony Princess,5,"This is one of the finest vehicle I have
owned or driven in my life-and 30+ years
of owning vehicles. She is a comfortable
and cute little princess with great
handling around town or on the Interstate.
She is a real head turner and has one
flaw-the steering wheel only telescopes
and does not adjust up or down. Alas,
she is a joy to be enveloped in and
experience the drive/ride!"
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Juan Garrido, 08/08/2004,Best Car I ever had,5,"The car is incredible.  It gets a lot 
of attention and it's fun to drive.  
Even though it does not have the most 
horsepower it is fast.  The car feels 
and looks great.  It gets a lot of 
attention on the road and everyone is 
always asking questions about it."

chrysler,crossfire,2005,dq, 09/10/2004,head turner,5,"I cannot drive this vehicle without 
having people stare, stop, and ask me 
what it is. The ergonomics are 
fantastic, and I disagree with some of 
the interior reviews that I have read. 
The leather seats are right out of a 
Mercedes, and the dashboard is tight 
and without rattles (trust me I 
previously owned a Mustang Cobra). I 
miss the lower end torque of the 
Mustang, however at 130 + mph I would 
rather be in the Crossfire."
chrysler,crossfire,2005,Frederick Harris, 09/09/2004,Delighted new owner,4,"In general the design, style, ride, 
handling and comfort are A+.  
Performance bespeaks the heavy 
structural members of the SLK rather 
than a light zippy street machine.  
Hence the image experienced by the 
driver is that of owning a Mercedes 
under an incredibly innovative 
Chrylser-designed skin.  Just right 
for babyboomer trendsetters whose nest 
is now empty and can therefore afford 
a moderately-expensive roadster."
chrysler,crossfire,2006,Aldo, 07/31/2010,She is 100% Merc & Chrysler in name only,5,"She & i say She, is a Peregrine Falcon. On the highway, all other cars for her are pigeons,  with the exception of a few eagles. She is 100% pure German Mercedes, with with nothing of Chrysler in her, except the name. For those that don't believe, lift her hood & check out the 12 spark plugs on her 6 cylinder engine. And what a fine engine she has! It pulls like a turbine fed small locomotive, just like her 8 cylinder big brothers! Love her!     "
chrysler,crossfire,2006,Cincinnati Slim, 04/20/2007,A fun loving beauty!,4,"This is such a cool little car! Beautiful, impractical, cramped and hard to see out and I'm just crazy about it. Like a super hot girlfriend, you overlook her bad habits because you're having so much fun!  Some car reviewers have said the car's chassis and brakes are so good that It could use more power. I'm sure not complaining. I think it's a blast to drive yet, unlike most performance cars I've had, it is very forgiving. The ESP/Traction Control/ABS systems work very well especially in bad weather. It really makes you feel like a hero."
chrysler,crossfire,2006,rampage, 02/10/2008,What a deal,5,"I bought this on a whim when I was looking for a Mazda 3 wagon a year ago. The $19k price tag was a deal maker.  Driving it is a treat and I'm still impressed with its handling, braking and looks. The 6 speed manual taps the power in the engine efficiently and it feels great to be pressed back into the seat upon acceleration. The only drawback is that is does not go up icy hills well so it's garaged when it snows.  My 6'3"" tall husband cannot strech his legs out straight, but he is very willing to make the sacrafice. Cargo area is plentiful for everyday and weekend jaunts. I swore I would never own a Chrysler product but this is the best car I've ever had.  "
chrysler,crossfire,2006,ShirazRoadster, 10/18/2008,Beautiful Styling & a Great Ride,4,"Bought the car last summer on a whim, $14k off the sticker price helps, right? The car is great once you get it out of first gear (they should have combined 1st and 2nd, you have to shift too quickly), has styling that gets a ""Nice car!"" at least once a day, and has gas mileage that is much better than I was expecting of around 22-24 mpg. "
chrysler,crossfire,2006,Shagfire, 08/18/2007,Awesome!,5,"I've only had the car a couple of weeks, but it is a blast to drive! It gets a lot of looks from passersby.

Driving this car is like becoming part of the vehicle, you become one with the seat and thus the car itself. I am so glad I found this vehicle. The car is a brand new 2006 with  13 miles on it and I have only had it for 2 weeks but the car is sexy, curvy,sleek and so retro in design. I love this car and I absolutely love driving it. It is a true head turner. Thanks for the dream come true. "
chrysler,crossfire,2006,Clyde Bailey, 06/18/2018,sporty vehicle but with problems,3,"This model car has a history of electrical problems, and mine is no exception. I've spent over $4000 trying to solve one problem that it still has--it frequently won't start on the first try--turn the key and you get nothing--no lights, no sounds, no start. I've replaced every item in the starting system without changing the no-start situation. Hot/cold weather, long-term parking, frequent use, all have no effect on the starting problem. I've discovered that when it won't start (about one time in a half-dozen attempts), pumping the clutch 2-3 times usually solves the problem. Twice I've gone outside and found the flashers working on the left side of the car without being turned on. Had to disconnect the battery.

chrysler,crossfire,2006,glmiller, 05/22/2009,What a Car!,5,"The car is fun to drive.  The power for such a sample car is unbelievable.  The gas mileage is reasonable and the craftsmanship is outstanding. Some of the problems is that it only has one cup holder in the cabin.  Also when getting the oil changed, if you don't do it yourself, be ready for a shock.  The filter is $31.00.  The engine takes 8.5 quarts of 0 W 40 which is not cheap.  So the total cost for a change will run between $110 to $120.  But the enjoyment of the car is well worth the price. "

The cupholder does work once you get used to it. Yes, the Console isn't a high point, yet you can upgrade to almost any material ie wood. Legroom is short and I'm maybe 5'10"". Still it's seats are good for a roadster. Put aftermarket Chip in and yes it was quicker but electric fan always stayed on. Took it out. Don't miss the little extra HP. Drove SLK 320 liked Crossfire better cause it looks better yet could not find extra price value with the MB. Ex wants car back. Would like to buy it. NO WAY MAN"
chrysler,crossfire,2006,bigdaddy0345, 12/22/2009,poor service,3,"I have had this car for awhile and have no problems till I brought it in for service. Had the oil changed and now I have a leak. Twice in about the leak and they said no leak, till I gave them the paper with oil on it. The car is great, but the service stinks. Don't trust corporate, they will avoid fault. I think I will stay with a Hyundai"

This car is the most fun to drive vehicle I've ever owned!  It turns heads everywhere I go.  Great craftsmanship and handling. I hate to see Chrysler stop building them."
chrysler,crossfire,2006,Johnnie Mack, 02/23/2008,A supercar for most folks,4,"Coming up on a year with this car, and have had nothing but good experiences. No glitches, just a nice commuter vehicle for my wife and I. Very nimble, and fast enough to suit me-the numbers suggest it will accelerate as fast as my old '89 Trans Am, but I'm out of the ""rat race"".  Tires are still in very good shape, and just 2 oil changes for maintenance.  A few negs-the seat is probably better in the Limited model, so maybe a retro fit is in order-this one generates complaints from my lovely wife of 31 years.  And the radio is annoying.  As we know now, the car has been killed by the new Chrysler. I guess a notchback version with a removeable window is out of the questions now, eh?"
chrysler,crossfire,2006,Larry, 09/26/2007,Crossfire Limited Convertible,5,"Purchased Spring, 2007 for daughter. This car has it all; looks, ride, power and safety features. For the price, we could not find a similar convertible with all these features.  The dealer incentive was the selling point.  We are pleased with the gas mileage, upper 20's on the highway and lower 20's in city. The only negative point has been a small water leak near the top and drive window. Expect to get this repaired easily."

chrysler,crossfire,2006,Lee11800, 05/05/2008,Crossfire Roadster,4,"Was looking for a two seater sports car and considered Z-4, Miata, and similar cars.  In my opinion, Crossfire is by far more top tend than Miata, cooler then Z-4 and others.  I drive this car to work, 24 miles a day, and love it.  Head turner for sure, glued to the road, great average full economy of 24 mpg, and drives like it looks.  Great value."
chrysler,crossfire,2006,shypoke, 05/17/2008,2006 Crossfire,4,Excellent car for a two seater.  Get a seat cushion for long trips if your back end is bony like mine. Use high-heel gel pads for your elbows (at the obvious places).  I looked at lots of this type of car... wouldn't have anything else.
chrysler,crossfire,2006,Mark, 01/29/2019,Had my crossfire experience,5,"I owned a 2006 crossfire from 2008 until 2018. Loved that car. But i was ready for a new experience, so I bought a 2015 lexus rc350 fsport. The tech and amenities were literally 12 years newer which the cross simply didn't have. Not that that was a really big deal. The cross, even as a ltd, was very fast. It handled well in the snow. For a rear wheel drive. Steering was fine. It was really hard for me to trade the cross. Very hard. But I wanted another experience and the rc has fit that. And that was the only car that would have enticed me to sell the cross. I could have easily kept that car the rest of my driving life in a sports car. That's how good that car truly is.

chrysler,crossfire,2007,Gene Randall, 08/08/2017,2007 Chrysler Crossfire-Pretty wonderful,5,"Make sure it has good all season tires-Goodyear has a set. These tires are very expensive.  Make sure no fluid leaks, radiator secure, lighting all works properly, Tmps light works properly.  I have had two of these cars and both reports a false positive.  Eventually was able to sort the problem-two tires were under inflated-light will signal with this condition.  If one low then waits until that tire is 25% low.  I had a convertable and now have a coupe.  I personally perfer the coupe.  The convertable is fun and may handle a bit better.  Both cars pull one ""G"" on the skid path.  Steering is a little old fashion-recirculating ball instead of rack and pinion.  However this is a solid car with Mercedes running gear, driveline and gauges and switchgear.  So if you are looking for a Mercedes vehucle without cash outlay then this is the car for you.  I paid $7000.00 for each one- the coupe is a 2007 and has 78000 miles, the convertable was  a 2005 and had 105000 miles.  I would recomend that you buy the lowest milage car you can find.  Also check service records and make sure proper oil changes are made .  8.5 quarts of Mobile one full synthetic.  Also make sure that it has always been filled with premium gas-otherwise can cause engiene issues.  Also might want to replace the Key Fob cases- can be had on Amazon for 10.00 each.

chrysler,crossfire,2007,Len, 10/03/2008,Best car for the money,4,"I bought my '07 limited for $19k with 2000 miles in April 2008. I like it because it is a great balance between comfort and performance, and for the money I didn't consider anything else. It is fun to drive, good on gas, maneuverable and relatively quick. I am 6'2"" and fit comfortably in it, the seats are supportive yet the matte orangy-brown leather is soft on the back.  I drove the car on a 4 hour trip through NYC traffic and was comfortable the whole time. I could not imagine having the car automatic, but don't get along with the shifter sometimes. "
chrysler,crossfire,2007,norman, 02/28/2018,"fun to drive, but with some problems of concern",5,"great vehicle, airbag was on the list to be replaced.  convertible window -poor- overweight. causes window to separate from top.  not covered by extended warranties.  if you buy one, its worth it, but look to have something that protects you in case this happens.  Chrysler made the top only.   top needs to be stronger to hold window: If you buy a new top, just make sure it is a quality with some kind of warranty.

Update: Top replaced with guarantee, window came apart again had rear window re-done.  I would highly recommend this vehicle, for just the fun factor alone.

These cars are a real value if you can still find them new. The car runs and handles very well. It also rides very well for a roadster, is extremely solid, and has very good fit and finish. Hopefully it will be reliable but it also has lifetime, unlimited milage drivetrain warranty and I purchased lifetime, unlimited milage wrap around Chrysler warranty for additional $1,200 with a $100.00 deductable. Peace of mind for major repairs if you plan on keeping the car long term as I do. The car looks great and is just a lot of fun. Only comes out on nice days. A real keeper."

Lifetime warranty on the Mercedes powertrain, This was the bargain of a lifetime! Handles fantastic, after 300 miles appears to get >21 MPG driven hard. Great midrange & higher lateral Gs than MS3.

chrysler,crossfire,2007,Norm, 01/19/2008,Norm's joy,4,I replaced the wiper blades . The original were hard and did not clear in rain. The inside of the inside door pull had burs and was replaced.No other problems. These problems were corrected by Chysler without charge.This car hangs on curves and the road like glue. A great sport car. I have had 5 Corvette's and this Crossfire is as much fun to drive. It is all German except the skin. The crafsmanship is top of the line of most sports cars. I have had many complements on the looks of the car. You will have to drive it to appreciate it. Rumers are that the production will stop after 08 so this car will be a classic. 
chrysler,crossfire,2007,erzer, 11/29/2008,XF - eXtreamly Fantastic,4,"A highly under rated car by many people simply because of the Chrysler name. This car handles very well in the curves and with the auto shifter, it's very easy to downshift when needed.  Average MPG is 25 highway mostly. This is my daily driver, but stock tires (Conti's) are not good on any snow, wet driving is good; you'll need better tires if driving in winter conditions;rims are staggered but you can go with staggered tires if you can find the right ones.  Costs for avg buyers to think about - high profile tires, premium fuel, 100% synthetic oil (only change every 7k).  Overall, this car is worth the money and I'd say undervalued.   "

But this car really has plenty of pep.  The car is solid compared to the Solstice and Sky models.  In addition, the car has far more features than the GM and most of the other import convertibles.  You can't beat the price of a used Crossfire.  Bang for the buck, it is the best two seater on the market."

However, the complete lack of lumbar support, somewhat cramped interior ( I'm 6', 200 lbs ), lack of cup holders, other than 1 pop up, which doesn't work, kept me from buying. However, now that Chrysler is selling them at $12,000+ off msrp/sticker, the deal was too good to pass up. These cars are very high quality at a bargain price. :)"

I have not driven many sports cars but this one is fun to drive! You have to be in reasonable physical shape to get in and out. Mom don't fit... I immediately got an extended warranty and Xylon(sp?) coating from a Chrysler dealership. Hopefully it will prove a dependable car for a long time as I tend to keep cars for 10years or so.

I've been driving SUVs for the past 15 yrs and felt no reason to switch.  As a likely symptom of my midlife crisis (??), I found myself wanting a new car.  Not just any car.  I wanted a different car -- in a true sense of the word.  I didn't want a Lexus or BMW.  I was quite smitten with the look of the Infinite FX35.  It was different and cool.  I drove one.  I was completed deflated.  It was a boring ride.  Then, I saw Crossfire. I felt stimulated and intrigued.  I went and drove one.  I was hooked.  It was gorgeous and different on the outside.  Driving made me feel something powerful"

Almost no body roll. -Styling is great to ""tragically unique"" -Bulletproof Mercedes parts. -Sporty suspension might be a con to some, a definite pro to me. CONS: -Tire noise from it's $220 (!) huge rear tires is understandable. Wind noise and plastic creaking from its cheap interior is not. -Steering is numb, pedals are squishy. -Impossible in rough weather. -Standard coupe compromises, trunk, leg room, ect. -6.5sec to 60MPH is just okay. -Blind spots are workable, but still there."

Sticker was 41,500, we got it for 32,000 total (tax, title, etc.) and are very happy with the car.  The best feature of the car is the styling - very unique.  I get positive comments most everywhere I go.  Have a bad day at work?  Do as my wife and I - drop the top, go for a ride in the country and you'll be smiling.  This car is comfy for a short wheelbase, 2-seater, the seats too.  I plan to keep this car for a long time, as is my custom.  If you own a Crossfire, join the Crossfire International Car Club Inc. (Google CICCI) - you won't regret it.  "
chrysler,crossfire,2008,sportcarman12, 03/17/2012,Great Handling Car,5,we bought our Chrysler Crossfire Limited convertible in december 2010. I was amazed by the looks of the car & was impressed with the prefromance & handling. So far we have had no problems with the car but we change the oil every 3 thousand miles and you get better preformance if you use the best oil you can find. Yes on road trips the tires are loud but that doesnt matter because everything else about the car comprimises for the loud tires. we launch from 0-60 im 5.6 seconds & the breaking on the car is just amazing. Those of you who are looking for a very good sports car for a low price this would be the car for you. You can get the srt-6 used for 22k or get the regular for 15k-25k. 
chrysler,crossfire,2008,Bobbylew, 08/22/2009,So Far So Good,4,I am very happy with my car. It handles great and so far is quite dependable. Watch out for the trunk lid. I made the mistake of leaving it half way closed after getting something out of the trunk and I wound up killing the battery. When I purchased the car the one key didn't work. The dealership had to get the replacement from Mersedes and they told me it would have cost me $150. for me to buy one if it wasn't under warranty if say I lost mine. I haven't had  any other problems so far.
chrysler,crossfire,2008,Len, 11/26/2008,Fun to Drive,4,"I bought this vehicle new some 10 months ago. I use this car exclusively for pleasure driving and consequently have less than 3,000 miles on it. The car handles well and is fun to drive on back roads. It lacks raw power and is not a head-jerker off the line. The auto transmission is slow to shift. I don't regret buying this car but would buy a Vette if I had it to do over again. But the price difference between the Crossfire and Vette is steep - I believe the Crossfire is a better value for the buck.     "
chrysler,crossfire,2008,TomD, 01/19/2009,I love it !,5,"Bought my '08 in mid December in NY and drove it home to South Texas as an early Christmas gift to myself! Great price (15k discount) and great car. Very solid machine and inspires confidence. Everything works as it should and I am very, very happpy with purchase. Average gas mileage on 1750 mile trip was 25.3 mpg, nearly all interstate. Make sure your bill of sale says new! I see some new ones for sale (by Chrysler dealers) as used, even with only 10 mi. on the odometer, to avoid the lifetime powertrain warranty to the original owner. Be careful!"
chrysler,crossfire,2008,M.Heiden, 04/06/2009,No Comparison Anywhere...,5,"This car is ""proof"" positive of how over rated Toyota and Lexus are.  This car looks great, drives great and was more than reasonable to purchase.  I refuse to drink the Kool Aid and believe that everything from Japan is great...  This is my second one, a 2005 coupe and now a convertible.  My last Corvette almost rattled my teeth out of my head, and my kidneys still don't work properly.  I think I'll buy one more and leave it in garage for when these wear out at 200k..."
chrysler,crossfire,2008,Andrea, 06/02/2008,Absolutely Love it!,4,"I was looking for something sexy to replace my Jeep Liberty and certainly found it in the Crossfire.  It's gorgeous, fun, and gets much better gas mileage. Of course, it helped that the dealership knocked $12K off the list to sell it...and yes, it was brand new!  Is it worth the list of $37K? No and that's why they're discontinuing them.  But, for $25K? Absolutely!"
chrysler,crossfire,2008,caremanager, 08/09/2008,My wife loves her new Crossfire,4,"We are very happy with our Crossfire. My wife could have picked any convertible she wanted in the $40k range. She chose the Crossfire because of it's beautiful styling and head turnablity factor. She absolutely loves her car. What made it even better yet was the incredible deal we got on this vehicle. We just couldn't say no to the $29,900 price tag for this fully loaded car. No other convertible even came close to that price with this many features. The time is right to get this end of model year German built sports car."
chrysler,crossfire,2008,Orlando Realtor, 12/05/2008,Love it,4,"Had to downsize from a 06 Vette, (times are tough for realtors) Love my new Crossfire which I bought for 22k with only 1200 miles. Spoiled as I am from the Vette I truly lo the styling. Everyone in the office said they liked it better than the Vette, looks like my bosses 500SLK without the price, test drove one of those too and still decided on a Crossfire. Haven't tried the navigation yet and miss it from the Vette. Seats stink comparably, however with a lumbar pillow I suffice. Flawless power top although it's slow. Decent stereo for the price. Good pickup even if its not lightning fast. Stupid cool active spoiler makes people look. Love the side fins! Half the payment of the Vette so I'm very happy"
chrysler,crossfire,2008,Zoom, 04/24/2008,Love It,4,"Love the design,  very comfortable for a two seater.  Loads of trunk space (for a 2 seater).  Can easily get two golf bags and weekends worth of gear in it.  Not a drag racer but has plenty of giddy-up.  Reasonable cost after good discount.  If you love it, keep it since the resale value is almost nothing.  "

chrysler,crossfire,2008,Bob out West, 09/16/2009,Personal Bang for the Buck,4,"Mercedes chasis (albeit older) and handbuilt coachwork with more art in its tail than 99% of the entirety of other cars on the road.  This is entirely impossible for less than $50k, let alone the price at under $25k.  My history includes a Jag, Tiger, Jensen, X 1/9, 2 Mustangs, CRT (manual) and more, and the fun/comfort quotient on this ride dwarfs them all.  Some say that this is more of a boulivardier than a sports car, but it is rock solid, planted like an oak on the road, and goes like scat.   Blind spot and rear view sounds bad, but after 1k driving it becomes second nature and unannoying. Cup holder is less than useless, Nav and radio both hopelessly outdated. "

We should have know then to just take it back.  Anyway, it is now on the 3rd transmission at 108,000 miles.  I can't even begin to say how many times the belts have broken.  We will NEVER buy a Chrysler Van again.  "
chrysler,grand-voyager,2000,family_guy1, 03/10/2012,Great car except for the rust,3,"I got it at 80k now has 105k replaced front brakes, water pump and several pulleys as well as the belt. The big stuff was corrosion issues. The rear brake lines were rusted out at the ABS Pump which is under the van. I also had to have the power steering lines replaced from corrosion. Also one of the gas tank straps rusted through and snapped in half.
The body has rust issues at the bottom of the liftgate, above the rear wheel wells and the rocker panels by the rear wheel and under the front drivers door. The front hood is also prone to rust as well. The weird thing is many of these issues are caused by factory installed plastic stickers covering the drain holes."
chrysler,grand-voyager,2000,raindance74, 10/13/2011,"Great car, very fun & reliable !",4,"I bought this car back in 2005 with 160,000 miles on it. It now has over 250,000 and still runs strong. Its the base model without all the bells and whistles, and in the 6 years I've owned it, I only had to replace the fuel pump. I've never replaced the transmission or engine, and it get good gas mileage. When you remove the rear seats, it has more room than a truck bed. They did have a recall on this model year for the clock spring but I repaired mine myself and Chrysler USA reimbursed me for the costs and sent me a check (you can also take it into any Chrysler dealer for free to be fixed). Highly recommend this auto."

with a vehicle.  The gas mileage is 
poor, the vehicle has been terribly 
unreliable and we have had over the 
past year 3 significant issues with 
our transmission.  The power of the 
engine leaves much to be desired, the 
tires wear inconsistently which our 
dealership tells us has been an issue 
with the Voyager.  In total it has 
been to the garage about 15 different 
times in the short time we have had 
it.  I will NEVER buy another 
Voyager/Caravan again."

one of these! "

V6 3.3 engine with a tow package.  The 
only drawback I have is the interier 
has a few rattles in it and the front 
and side cup holders are not deep 
enough for larger cups, as in fast food 
cups. I have had both Caravan and 
Voyager minivans and I liked them 
both.  I would buy another one."

My wife owned one first and we kept that one for 140k miles. Air went at 180k on my car and 140k on hers. That's about it. Cost about $8k less than the SUV's when I bought it, and have done everything from camp out of it to commute at 65 mph day in and day out. Kept me safe in one deer/car crash."

We had the tranny and differential rebuilt (it's one unit) and she's been running strong to this day.
She's at 226k and showing no signs of giving up.
Our friends always want to take our car because it's so comfortable.
She always has plenty of power and is fun to drive.

I expect to drive it for at least 2 more years.  To avoid a new car purchase, I recently detailed the interior and ordered $400 worth of replacement trim, including the hood molding and a pair of speakers to replace the blown front right woofer.

I have had lots of trouble with the tires, actually the wheels cause slow leaks so I put air in the tires almost as frequently as I put gas in the car, and I am on my second set of tires due to premature wear on the tires.  Also the front bumper is peeling and the finish/paint is looking a little faded on the entire vehicle.  I upgraded to Michelin's last time and they are getting chewed up.  "

The car performs well and the 3.5 litre, 250 horsepower engine has plenty of power and gets pretty good mileage.      

The car has a roomy interior and substantially more rear leg room than most cars, many of which cost substantially more. I can accomodate four men comfortably and get four sets of golf clubs in the large trunk.  Try this with most other cars.

We had some door lock issues and repairs you would expect after 131k miles but otherwise no repair issues. I could probably drive it another 50k miles but the deals on the '09 300C are just too good to pass up. I'll be saying good-bye to my LHS tomorrow when I turn it in for my new 300 hemi. The 300 is a great looking car but I must say the interior on my LHS offers more. I'm hoping I will enjoy this new car as  much as I have the LHS."
chrysler,lhs,2000,Hawkeye, 06/01/2002,LHS Lover,4,"Great Car - my 2nd LHS - also had 
a '99. No problems with either one 
except for sticking power windows 
(stronger door motors installed). This 
was because the seal was so tight it 
gripped the windows - a testament to 
it's quality."
chrysler,lhs,2000,LHS, 08/30/2009,Great Car,5,"I bought it used in 2001.  It has been a great car. The only thing besides routine maintenance was a drivers side power window motor.  Bought a new motor from NAPA for 65.00 and spent 45 min changing it. I have never gotten less than 22mpg and as high as 30mpg across New York. Highway average 28 and in town 23. It has almost 110,000mi and runs and looks like new.  I got 50,000 out of the first 2 sets tires. I have not been back to the selling dealer for anything since I bought the car. It has been a much better car than either of my Honda accords were."
chrysler,lhs,2000,HeyBlu, 12/18/2009,I wish they still made them today!,4,"I bought this car used with nearly 58K miles. I now have 147K and have had no major issues. Replaced AC compressor twice, and starter once. The suspension is about due for repair, struts, etc..."

With 253 horses under the hood, this 
car jumps off the pavement.  I put alot 
of miles on cars.  This one is fun to 
be in, comfortable, and user 
friendly!!  The only minor problem with 
it is that the back window is hard to 
see out of.  Also there is no place to 
put your sunglasses. Overall this car 
is a must buy!"

Chrysler when I travel so much, I did 
not know what to expect with my LHS.  
It has been an excellent car.  Runs 
good, looks good and more importantly, 
has had to be in the shop only a couple 
of times and those were ""trim"" issues.  
Would highly recommend this car to 
anyone."
chrysler,lhs,2000,Mike O, 02/21/2008,Great Car = Best I Ever Had,5,"This car is still going strong at 103,000 mi. Still original brake lining and get 25-27 mpg on the highway. Engine uses no oil between changes. Car looks good and drives great. I wish the new Chrysler was fwd so I could trade. Only criticism is road noise. I would like a quieter ride. Only repair was an air cond evaporator at 78,000 mi. "
chrysler,lhs,2000,jimsberg, 02/20/2003,Chrysler LHS,4,"An unbelievable bargain; can't wait to 
drive it every day.Far better than 
previous 1994 LHS. Fuel mileage 
somewhat disappointing: 18mpg in town, 
24-25mpg on highway. Actually is fun to 
drive (handling)in a way that Ford and 
GM luxury cars are not."

absolutely enjoy this vehicle.  
Chrysler made the mistake to 
discontinue the name, LHS has more 
character than the sister car (although 
just as nice), the Concorde.  It 
handles nice, rides wonderfully, has a 
great sound system.  A great head 
turner...even had an 80+ year old lady 
comment on the chic style."

back seats are comfortable for my

of us, but the car has rarely needed 
anything.  It has been a joy, 
especially considering the reasonable 
price.  I expect to own this car 10 
years."
chrysler,lhs,2000,Art Schoepfer, 04/10/2004,"Great car, flimsy trim",4,"Overall, this is a great car, roomy, 
good styling, and well built. One 
obvious defect, is the exterior plastic 
trim which becomes brittle after 2-3 
years. The plastic hood trim on my car 
actually blew off my car when I was 
traveling on the highway. I complained 
to Chrysler about this, but they told 
me this is normal for this car, and 
they don't intend to do anything about 
it. It costs more than $150 to replace 
this defective trim."
chrysler,lhs,2000,LHS, 08/21/2006,Great Car,5,"Great car. I have owned it over 5 years and 90,000 mi. It has never been back to the dealer for anything. Original tires went 42,000mi and the second set still have 1/3 of the tread left. One set of brake pads at 65,000 mi. At 86,000 mi I changed the timming belt as preventive maint. No other repairs or problems. It still looks new, gets great gas mileage, and is fun to drive. Great car in every way"

chrysler,lhs,2000,New England, 04/23/2005,Love It,4,This is a big car that feels smaller when you drive it.  It holds the road well and handles better than expected. The styling stands out and and looks as good today as it did when I bought it.
chrysler,lhs,2000,Joe C., 06/20/2005,Best American car made in 2000,4,"I never imagined that a car this large would show between 27-30 MPG consistently on the road and 21 in the city.  Chrysler has a winning formula in the LHS.  Sadly I must part ways with it as it is time to move to something new for my business.  If you can find one like mine, buy it with your eyes closed!  These cars are excellent - few mechanical problems, high reliability."

chrysler,lhs,2000,Ted Pysh, 10/01/2007,Owner/operator,4,"I bought this car in 2002 for $18,000 as a ""winter"" car. I sold my other vehicle and kept this one. I didn't care what went wrong with it and so...nothing did. Finally put in new brakes at 73,000 miles. Put in a new battery out of ""guilt"" after 6 years. This car has never let me down. Starts and runs beautifully in any weather. Excellent winter driving car. Great road car. Gets 20mpg. consistently which amazes me for a big V6 engine. It's just a wonderful vehicle. Currently 86,000 miles, but starting to show its age and regretfully I'll have to trade it in."
chrysler,lhs,2000,Ted Price, 07/25/2007,A wonderful American car surprise!,4,"I have had this car for 5 years. It has never let me down. I didn't need new brakes until 73,000 mi. I put a new battery in it (6 year old battery) mostly out of guilt, because there was no problem with the ""original"" six year old battery. The gas mileage is about 20 mpg in town (sometimes more). I bought it as a ""winter car"" to replace my Lexus but wound up keeping it. It had 18,000 miles on it when I bought it. Now has 85,000 and runs like a top."
chrysler,lhs,2000,New Birdman, 11/13/2002,Well Priced Luxury,5,"I had been driving Intrepids for the 
last 6 years and considered a 300M when 
I bought the new 2000.  Went with the 
LHS because of the room--plenty inside 
and a cavernous trunk.  Nice interior 
touches that create a more elegant 
look.  Very comfortable ride without 
being too boaty.  Power is good.  
Shifts smoothly.  I put about 24K miles 
a year on it and have had no problems."
chrysler,lhs,2000,Mike Caldwell, 06/22/2003,2000 Chrysler LHS,5,"I traded a 94 Cadillac Seville for this 
car.  The Chrysler has more options 
than the Cadillac and is much cheaper 
to operate.  Gas milage is about 28-
30mpg on the highway depending on my 
speed.  At 70-75 it usually gets around 
27-28 mpg."
chrysler,lhs,2000,Mshelley, 04/14/2008,Awesome,4,"Bought this car in 2002, have loved it since.  Great ride, lots of fun. We live in NE so lots of snow and this car handles beautifully. I haven't spent a lot of money on it, beyond the normal wear and tear stuff. We replaced the brakes twice, and unfortunately we had to replace all four door locks, that was a bit pricey.  As far as performance nothing has gone wrong.  I just bought a new car, and am still keeping this one, can't bare to part with it.  Will keep it till it really dies."
chrysler,lhs,2000,Corey Van Buren, 04/25/2008,Great!,4,"I am the second owner of this car and it has been great.  It currently has 185,000 miles.  The fuel pump went out at 90K and I have replaced the front bearings but everything else on the car is fine.  The body and the interior has held up great, it still sparkles.  "
chrysler,lhs,2000,Totaly Satisfied, 09/06/2018,NOW almost an Adult at 18 Years Old,5,"My Father purchased this 2000 model car new in 1999.  He never had any trouble with it and passed it onto me a few years ago.  The ride is smooth and excellent and despite its big car feel in how well it ugs the road the gas mileage has been great for this size car. The instrumentation is all clear to see and while today electronics have gone way beyond most cars built in 2000 the LHS was at the top of the game.  I would not hesitate to purchase its replacement model the 300.  This was a gem of a car that is still ticking.

better value in a luxury car. 
Everything from style, comfort and 
performance cannot be beat at this 
car's price. My wife and I have driven 
this car 55000 miles and have yet to 
put a single dollar toward anything 
other than routine maintenance. It is a 
pleasure to own and drive, and we get 
daily compliments on its appearance and 
style."

chrysler,lhs,2001,Golferbill, 11/09/2005,Best car ever owned,4,Had two Cadillacs before this car.  Fell in love with LHS design when it first came out.  Waited two years and monitored owner bulletin boards until all bugs and complaints seemed to have been worked out.

chrysler,lhs,2001,TW, 09/26/2009,150000 miles on original battery,4,"Best car I have owned. I have driven this thing 150,000 miles and it has only had 2 malfunctions. Shift Cable broke which I discovered was a design flaw in the cable. Also had to replace the Control Module.  Still have the original battery though.  Love to drive this car on the highway. I hugs the curves and holds speed through the mountain roads.  I can't find a car that gives this styling, features and ride."
chrysler,lhs,2001,Marx, 10/13/2010,This is luxury,5,"I bought this vehicle used just about 3 months ago with over 116,000 miles on it. Drives great, runs like a cheetah, could accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hr in just a few seconds. The music and speakers are perfect, the 4 cd exchanger is very convenience. The all electronic chairs, doors, steering wheel music control system button is so awesome. Large spaced trunk."
chrysler,lhs,2001,golfpro, 08/13/2002,execellent car,4,"had good luck. excellent ride. power to 
pass when needed and to get onto 
expressways."
chrysler,lhs,2001,sporty, 03/01/2002,not too great as i hoped,2,"This car is defenatley not what i had expected. The reliablility of this car is poor, everything keeps falling apart as the mileage on my car goes up. The breaks wear out every once a month, which is costing me extra money. The windshield wipper broke off after 6 months of usage, and even the glove compartment hadle came loose. 
  Overall: don't buy this car unless you don't mind paying extra for maintnance."
chrysler,lhs,2001,AAJL, 08/30/2003,LOTS OF ROOM AND COMFORT,4,"ONLY PROBLEM IS WITH CHROME TRIM ON 
WINDOWS. APPEAR TO BE MANUFACTURED WITH

BUT TOOK PATIENCE WAITING FOR DELIVERY. 
LOTS OF ROOM IN FRONT AND BACK. CAR IS 
LOW TO GRD AND FRONT IS OFTEN TOO LOW 
FOR CURB HEIGHT. OVERALL LOVE CAR."
chrysler,lhs,2001,Charles, 10/09/2005,My LHS,4,This auto has been an overall joy. My only critical comment is that the MPG could be better (~22-24 HWY) for a 6 cyl. I've had it now for almost 5 years and all components have worked well. I had expected the interior to be a bit quieter on the Highway given that this is a lux sedan - but folks share that when I change the ORM tires out (about another 30K miles) that will change. No wind noise to speak of which was a big improvement over the last auto. Even today it still is a sharp looking auto -  haven't seen anything else that zings me to trade it in. Engine is smooth and has enought spark to make it out of tight spots with little if any delay. Sound is really good with the BOSE system.
chrysler,lhs,2001,Marye, 07/23/2004,Great Car!,4,"This car is true luxury! I really love 
the spacious interior and the spacious 
cargo area. The ride is very 
comfortable with little outside noise. 
The audio controls on the steering 
wheel makes for easy control of music. 
My only complaint is that visibility at 
the back is limited by the high 
seatbacks and humped trunk. An 
excellent investment, however, and 
luxury at a relatively low cost."
chrysler,lhs,2001,softcoal, 01/29/2007,Chrysler LHS - Wish they still made them,4,"Bought this car new 6 years ago - have taken numerous trips in it, including a 6 week vacation with enough clothes for the whole trip - never a major problem - great comfort - lots of room in car and trunk. Chrysler luxury cars have all the features of the more expensive luxury cars at a lot smaller price.  This is our fifth one, but now we are in a quandary because the 300 series is so ugly - If you find a used LHS to buy, get it!   "
chrysler,lhs,2001,White LHS owner, 08/09/2007,Good car to own,4,"I have owned my 2001 LHS for slightly over a year now. Bought it with less than 25,000 miles; now has close to 40,000. It has been a very reliable car. My wife and I appreciate the heated seats in the winter. Much quicker car than I would have expected. My only complaint is that there is little leg room in the front; however I am 6'7"", so that is not a common concern for most people. My wife (who is a 'normal' height) is very comfortable. As mentioned in other reviews, interior noise is more than I would like, but it is not overwhelming. All in all, a very nice, comfortable, reliable car for a cheap (used) price.  I would suggest finding a low mileage, well taken care of car."
chrysler,lhs,2001,Chris S., 07/19/2007,The best car I ever owned,4,"I travel a lot in this car and it's just reliable. Now with more than 100k miles, just keeps going and doesn't require a lot of maintenance. Very comfortble and solid performance!"
chrysler,lhs,2001,Doug, 09/11/2007,Great car,4,"I enjoy the comfort and ride of the LHS - Luxury Highend Sedan. Even though I live in California and thought I would never use them, but the heated seats are a great feature during the winter.  Nice looking car"

After the extended warrentee expires however, I will not be able to afford to own this car!!!  I bet I've had the equivalent of $12000 of work done on this car."
chrysler,lhs,2001,curtwells, 12/03/2018,by far the worst,3,"Where can I begin. Brought the car with 103,000 miles only one owner. It looked great only a few  dings. About a week of ownership I decided to give it more gas on the freeway to past a car in front of me. Open up the passing gear on the trans car response was beautiful until I came up stopped at a light. When I proceeded to go I heard the clunk sound of a sprung bearing. This would be the beginning of the nightmare to come. Subframe, Transmission repaired twice, heated driver seat, and the abs motor which none are regular maintenance parts been replaced... . .

chrysler,prowler,2001,Brett D Garnett, 08/12/2015,MY ONCE IN A LIFETIME TOY,5,"Be aware that this is a car to be driven seldom and seen often!!!  Heads will turn wherever you are and people will congregate and ask questions including can they have a ride!!!  What is it? Etc, etc, etc...  I thoroughly enjoy driving this vehicle as I have a Mulholland Edition (Midnight Blue) with extra hand painted pin stripping and accents...  The front chrome grill also sets it off!!!  The car holds its value and my 2001 has only 7700 miles on it so it's like new.  Do not buy this car if you looking for comfort and a quiet ride.  This is a cruiser with high engine sound and a blasting sound system.  Just enjoy the attention it gathers and the great looks this vehicle has.  I love every minute I'm behind the wheel and also when I'm cleaning and babying it!!!  I've noticed that everyone around the car has a big smile on their face!!!  So Be Happy!!!

I recently took her out for a short drive and WOW!!!  She drives great, still turns heads and what a sound from the pipes!!!  :)  My wife and I so enjoy the ride and overall experience.

that's not why you buy a Prowler), but 
this is by far the best car I've owned

if you don't feel like being social, 
because everybody and I mean everybody

First one sold for $141K last $175K I'm holding on to this one, keep the miles low and hoping for a great return. If it never happens Who cares this is fun to drive and will never drop below 20K.

chrysler,prowler,2002,dblang, 12/01/2008,Great buy for the money,4,This car is unbelievable. Hand welded aluminum frame. A car built like this would be three times the price. The power to weight ratio would not be able to handle 300+ h.p. Everyone is right about the attention. Thumbs up from everyone. Not a bellybutton car like a Vette. Buy one and love life.

I enjoy the leather seats, being a dog groomer means lots of dog hair, but the leather is easy to clean. My only complaints are that the ride is a little noisy and rough (but i think it needs new shocks, being a 12 year old car), and i have had issues with the alloy wheels. the rims have slightly corroded (nothing visible to naked eye) but it was causing my tires to lose air regularly. bead seal was quick inexpensive fix.

I only paid $2,500 for it, 85,000 mi, and numerous people commented on what good condition it was in (I had test drove another PT at a different dealer; it was higher priced and was in bad condition). I learned to drive stick in this car; it is particularly more easy to stall in this car than in other stick shifts. It's not very good in the snow, so it's best to wait until the roads are plowed and salted to take it out.  I have a lot of tall friends (around 6 ft), and for being a small car it has a lot of leg/head room!  It is also a dream to parallel park and is very spacious on the inside!"

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2001,elsa anzalone, 09/24/2016,Love this car,5,"I bought my 2001 PT Cruiser in 2003 with 36K miles. I love the sunroof and the shelf in the back. It was always fun to drive and while Chrysler was not known for reliability, I didn't think I had a lot of problems because I am attentive to maintenance. I have had my car for 13 years and gone from 36k miles to 172k and STILL love it.

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2001,LittleSocrates, 12/31/2003,Very pleased...,4,"My used '01 PT was purchased a few
months ago with high mileage - about 75k
- from a dealer. It's a 5-speed, which
really helps the 150hp engine with
pick-up. The exterior is beautiful and
seems so far to be well constructed and
road-worthy. The interior is very
comfortable, but has some odd control
placements, and only the driver's seat
has a center arm rest. For such a
high mileage car (for it's age) this
baby has been a cherry piece. It still
drives like the newer model I test
drove, and is quite fun to pilot. Gas
mileage could be better (I average 23),
but it could be worse. All in all,
excellent buy. I may well consider another."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2001,Dennis, 07/15/2010,Best Car I've Ever Owned,4,"Bought in 12/2001. Now has 98K. Replaced suspension & exhaust w/better quality aftermarket. Car has no lean into curves like other PT's. Replaced 16x6 wheels w/17x7. Replaced air cleaner w/cold air box for more power & better sound. Sunroof glass shattered, brake caliper bent, bad LED light but no other probs. Always synthetic oil. Never a prob w/inspection. Disabled & it fits my needs perfectly. Cargo area will gobble up anything you want to put in it. Fits 4 tall adults w/no complaints. Can't really fit 5 because of load limit not because there's not enough space. 3 recalls all important. One of the best designed cars I've ever seen. Daimler cheapened subsequent years so avoid them."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2001,bike_canoe2, 03/06/2011,Chrysler is #3 for a reason!,2,"After owning a PT for 100,000 miles, I can only say it is an ok car.
GM's 4cyls get better gas mileage and have more power.
Ford's are more reliable. The turning radius is too big.
The seats are hard, with only one arm rest for the driver and none in the back.
Paint has lasted very well, it still shines.
There are better options on the market that you should consider.
I found out by my mechanic that this engine will be broken if the timing belt breaks"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2001,Cindy, 01/18/2010,PT PROBLEMS,3,"Bought 2001 PT Cruiser in 2003 with 34,000 miles on it. At 86,000 overheating caused head gasket to blow. Went ahead and replaced water pump, oil pump, timing belt, all accessory belts while engine was torn down hoping to save some labor later on down the road. Cost to repair 1,792. 2 yrs. later started to lose oil.The bracket that holds water pump in place broke and moved forward into oil pump and timing mechanism. Had to replace water pump, oil pump, head gasket, timing belt, accessory belts etc AGAIN. $2,200 for repairs. 13 months later overheating AGAIN. Needs cooling fan. Cost $720. Sunroof motor $750.

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2001,Shannon, 07/24/2010,Powertrain Computer Module,3,I have 2001 Pt Cruiser with 100400 miles on it the Computer has been replaced 3 times in less then 2 months. Does anyone have idea as what could be causing this problem. The EGR valve has melted and needed to be replaced 2 times in less then a month.
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2001,Kimberly, 09/14/2015,"The design is poor, not a good snow car",2,"My ex got this car used, at about 100k miles, for around $4k. From the beginning, I noticed that it seemed to have very poor suspension, and within a short time period the control rod and the tie rod ends started to fail on it. 

The car is now at 143k miles, and while the engine in it is still excellent and in good shape, the real Achilles heel of this car was its design. It was made for looks, and for mild climates; it's not made to last. 

The giant rear end on it seems to have proved too much for the frame design. The control rods went out twice over the 43k miles we had it: the suspension and ride were terrible, like a crackerbox really, and now that I'm dispensing with the car, the ball joints have failed, the tie rod ends (again), the CV joints have failed, all in the back of the car. Once it gets older, a bumpy road can cause steering to be tricky. The steering often pulled to one side, and the electrical system was also glitchy, failing several times in the rain, along with dead brake lights from time to time. 

I really don't recommend this for snowy climates. It's very bad in the snow; there isn't much clearance under the front bumper and it had a tendency to get stuck pretty easily. The high profile didn't handle wind well.

As others have mentioned, the rims had a constant tendency to peel, and the tires lost air constantly. 

On the upside, it had good gas mileage and it never did break down completely on me. It was a dogged car, a good engine in a poorly made body, and if you're a car type in a warm climate who has the time and inclination to fix its little foibles I'm sure it might even be a good deal. The engine is still just cherry in it, it goes at a nice clip once it gets going. I don't hate this car, but it's been very expensive and troublesome mostly due to the frame, electrical and tire issues.

At 199,000 miles she still starts like the day I bought her. I got the stick. The clutch held out until 165,000 mi.  Had to replace the fan motor at about 100,00 and replace timing belt as general maintenance. If you take proper care and maintenance it goes for ever. It is fun to drive and handles very well on the curves. Took it to Ohio (3500 mi) and back when it had about 185,000 mi on it with no problems and that was with it filled from floor to roof and back hatch to front seats with boxes of my mother-in-laws belongings.

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2001,Ultimatealtima89, 10/13/2008,2001 Chrysler PT Cruiser Touring,4,My Dad owns a 2001 PT Cruiser Touring. I really like it and it's pretty comfortable and looks nice. I've heard for a such a small engine it has better power than expected. I do have some complaints though. First of all the gas mileage on the PT Cruiser is a joke. It is a Chrysler so it has a plastic cheap looking dashboard but it doesn't look too bad. It has no front center console or rear folding center console for rear seat passengers. The back seats are uncomfortable because they are very straight and not reclined back. The rear power window buttons are basically on the ground so anything on the ground can roll the window down without you knowing. Other than those its very nice. 
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2001,Clinton70, 11/03/2008,Stunning design with crappy drivetrain,4,"If you want a car with one of the most awesome designs ever, in and out, and have alot of money to feed it gas, this is the car.  Actually, the mileage is still better than a pickup truck but at 17 city and 22 highway, the V6 Mazda 6 and Buick LeSabre's I had later had way better mileage and more power. Chrysler always knew how to make cool looking cars and put crappy engines and cheap plastics in them, even in 2008. Reliability was pretty good though, outside of a broken vent knob (plastic!), cupped tires, and even after a ""fix"", the alignment was still off. This car never left me for dead though and it went on a 4000+ mile trip to the west three times. It was the perfect road car too."

It's the biggest little car I've ever had (bought my first car in 1961). It's great in town - fits into small parking spots. And it handles well on the parkways and highways. The fact that it doesn't have the power of my previous 8-cylinder cars was a consideration when I bought it, but, for a 4-cylinder it does well, even at high speeds. It also handles snow and ice like a dream. Powers me through all kinds of winter weather.   "

Versatile space allowed two kegs and bags upon bags of booze to be transported. Bizarre power window switch placement, nice 5MT shifter, clear gauges, knuckles hit passenger seat when operating e-brake, single centered interior light a stupid idea and seating position too high and not laterally supported.  Car now gets no better than 20mpg at absolute best, and burns thru a quart of oil just over every 1000 miles with no sign of leak, even up on lift.  I need three additional quarts between oil changes.  Questionable fuel gauge accuracy.  Odd masking tape residue marks on gray bumpers appeared."

Only down side is, my husband decided it would be a good idea to put in dual exhausts. Which is nice as it improves performance and sounds like a hot rod.

After writing to Chrysler, they agreed to pay 75% of the repair and towing bills.  I purchased this car primarily for its comfort.  I have a very bad back and can't do bucket seats.

I love the way the interior looks and I like that the passengers in the backseat have access to the window controls. It is a 2001 model, but I am getting a new car because in the 2 years that I have owned it there have been several problems, such as: replacing the head gasket, air conditioning went out twice, and now my dimmer lights turn on by themselves and run the battery dead.

Apparently, they are very hard to work on due to the arrangement of everything inside. I hit a fire hydrant on the front right side and my insurance company wants to total the car even though it is fixable. The problem is the cost of the labor since it's so hard to work on. Other than that, I love the car! It's great for hauling large items since it's got removable back seats and it's always been really reliable. It was even pretty good on the ice in the winter time out here in Colorado! I would rather have my PT Cruiser fixed than have to try and find a car as good as this one!"

Although it's been an accident magnet, it has survived several minor crashes and a major clash with wildlife and has done very well. My only complaint is that I keep my cars a long time (10 to 12 years, over 150,000 miles) and my little PT isn't holding up to age like I'd hoped. The wheels are a chronic problem for mine and several others I know. They corrode from the inside out and lead to slow leaks in the tires. The chrome peels away if the wheel is fixed. Radiators also seem to be a common problem. Body trim is popping off. So while I love my PT, Tom just isn't aging as well as I'd hoped. "

black PT.CRUISER. It looks awsome when 
its cleaned up. Everywhere I go 
everyone is staring trying to see in, 
to see whos driving it. Now everyone 
knows it's mine, I live in a small town 
so of course evertime they see me they 
have to ask about it. I was the first 
to get one here, now there are 4 more 
in my town, but not like mine. Every 
time me and my husband decide to go 
somewhere we always chose my PT. to 
drive. I will not go anywhere unless 
I'm in it. To sum it all up its the 
funnest and greatest vehicle I have 
ever owned."

functional styling and genuine fun to 
drive! The design concept of retro car 
and mini-mini van versatility is 
perfect for my needs. The upright 
seating position is a plus for stiff 
knees. Fit and finish are excellent and 
with the dual exhaust, running boards 
and detailing I've added...it's the 
coolest PT in these parts. Going for 
the Turbo!"

It took a while to get used to the limited rear visibility, but that was no problem after a week or so. It's underpowered - even with a 5 speed manual. Handling is *terrible* in adverse conditions - especially snow. Strange masking tape marks appeared on the corners of the rear bumper. All that being said, I'd buy this car again in a second if I needed something that was both stylish and had the room to pack stuff in. "

My biggest complaint is a common one; fuel economy (20-) and performance. Another major factor is its complete inability to drive in the snow (Connecticut). The power to weight ratio just doesn't work. It strains at highway speeds, especially uphill. It's a good looking vehicle with lots of functional space but I wouldn't buy it again without some design changes."

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2001,architect.ed, 01/23/2006,My First American Car,4,"I fell in love with the styling, read all the automotive magazine reviews and found an early model for sale in Florida while visiting my dad.  I bought the car without a test drive, and was actually worried that maybe I wouldn't like it as much as the reviewers did.  No fear, I love this car, for its versatility, driving ease, and comfort.  Had it now 5 years and no problems - none.  Still tight and solid feeling.  Poor gas milage (22mpg average) is my only complaint.  I hope that I can keep it another 5 years, but worry a bit about long term reliability issues of most American cars.  It is not a German car but certainly better than I expected."

I never took out the seats, but carried hot water heaters out of Home Depot with no problem. Only put 2 seats down.Clearly one of the most dependable autos I've owned.  Seats are comfortable and keep you erect for long trips.  Noise is average for me.  I never expected a Cadillac/Mercedes.  I bought this for trasporting small loads around and for basic transportation.  A/C was OK. Never a problem, but in summer in FL, I sometimes felt warm in the start up process.  Brakes rear seem to get a grind once you begin your day, but that goes away-rear brakes after you depress brakes once or twice. "

I have a 2001 model that I purchased used in 2002 with approximatel 8500 miles on the odometer. I now have a little over 40000 miles on it and I have not had any problems with the vehicle. The utility of the vehicle is exceptional, you can really load the back with bulky items such as a large 36in TV, by simply dropping the seats.

the second was about $1480. I had 60k

Despite that we have a ""bumper to bumper"" extended warranty, it never seems to cover any of the issues and each service is several hundred dollars a time and at least $100 to diagnose.  The car has a VERY dangerous blind spot so you must adjust the mirrors exactly and take your eyes off the road to look behind you in both directions to change lanes.  The car is so underpowered that it cannot make more than 60 mph up a hill with 2 people in it.  The gas mileage is on its best day 20 mpg highway so don't buy this for fuel economy.

The window sticker said 20/25 and we could live with that but the actual gas mileage has been very irratic. We get between 16 and 22. we are comfortable in it but the gas is going to be expensive.
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2001,REM, 06/23/2006,1st PT,4,I bought this vehicle sight unseen. It has taken five years off my life and has gotten back to enjoying music in the car.
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2001,Tim, 09/16/2006,Tim Pt,4,This PT CRUISER IS A GREAT CAR TO DRIVE. We have taken it to many car shows and put a lot of custom parts on it. 
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2001,vincentorta, 11/03/2006,The Practical Transport Cruiser,4,"So far I am absolutely thrilled with my new PT.  What does PT really stand for anyways?  Oh well, I've been wanting one since the year they came out with them...whenever that was?  Seems like a long time ago.  I bought another vehicle and was totally displeased...we won't go there.  So far the PT is everything I'd hoped it would be and more, despite my families feelings against it.  They rented one while on vacation and said they didn't like it.  Said it was uncomfortable, they didn't like the window buttons locations...etc.  Compared to what I was driving, a 1985 Honda Accord, the PT is like a slice of heaven.  I'm taking it on a trip to Ga. from S.C. this weekend...we'll see how it does..."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2001,Doug, 12/02/2006,great idea,3,"I think the PT cruiser is very ergonomically designed. It's very comfortable, easy to get around town in and great for picking up groceries, etc. We have had problems with its constant hesitation, but hope to get problem taken care of next week."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2001,joplav, 01/02/2007,Class Act,4,"Reliable, fun, safe, it's mechanically reliable until the 1st timing belt change,at 128k miles, and then the upgraded belt was installed, the door locks malfunction. Otherwise, the car is the best I've had since my driving experience. I started driving in 1971 and have owned many a Dodge,Ford,& Chevy, and one foreign, Suzuki. Especially, in the snow. It handles better than most SUV's of todays times,and most 4 X 4's. I'm looking forward to my next PT, in a year or so, a 5 or 6 speed, 250hp. My finances will hopefully get better and I won't have to finance, this is whats holding me back. Economically the best overall drive I've ever experienced. I'm sold."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2001,Jeff, 02/27/2007,Great Car,4,"I've put 85,000 miles on this vehicle and it still drives well. It's been serviced for brake shoes, new tires, and the driver's side power window. I had to replace the radio at about 50,000. That's all. Not bad.  Feels bigger than it is. Cruises well on the freeway at 80 mph. Still feels solid. Handles well for a FWD car.  The build quality is more like a Honda than a US maker. Still no rattles. "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2001,Me Too, 03/05/2002,More fun to drive than my Jaguar XJ6,4,"I drove a '96 Jag and my husband was in the market for a new car.  One day when the Jag was in the shop (again!) they gave me a PT Cruiser as a loaner.  I loved it, told my husband he could drive the Jag and bought one a week later.  I've hauled a sheet of Wonderboard, a 9'x 12' carpet, kids, pets, etc.  It's like a van but much cuter and sportier!  I love this car!!! Mine is Inferno Red to match my cell phone.  Great for all my soccer mom type of driving and hauling."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2001,johnwstefan, 03/06/2002,Love that cruiser,4,"Had it for a year now.  Still an absolute blast to drive.  Build quality is exceptional for price paid. Nothing rattles or sqeeks.  Seats are comfortable and interior is roomy.  Really like how flexabile this car is and, obviously, how cool it looks.  We still get stares!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2001,Debi, 03/01/2008,Burst baloon,3,This is a fun vehicle to own and drive. I love it. The downside is Chrysler has changed parts company that have me replacing my control arm bushing because they split after 22 thousand Km. putting me outside the warrant period. 
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2001,Shawn, 05/19/2007,PT Cruiser - Excellent To Own,4,"Our PT Cruiser was purchased new in 2002 and has been a blast to own as a daily driver. My parents even bought a PT Turbo. The design and build quality are first rate. People still stop me today and complement how attractive it is. The interior has loads of room and due to the multi-configurations of the seating can haul larger loads than expected. It is a mini, fuel efficient, SUV.  The back seat height makes it comfortable for rear passengers to the extent that it is the preferred lunch transport for colleagues - and they are driving BMW 5 Series.  I would recommend it to anyone seeking a well built, stylish, fun to drive alternative to the boring econoboxes (Civic, Scion, VW).  "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2001,QA, 06/06/2007,Big Mistake,2,"Because the seats sit higher, you are able to enjoy an overall better view of the road. However, I wouldn't recommend anyone to purchase a PT Cruiser. The workmanship on the car is poor. The parts are of poor quality and break quickly. The price to fix the vehicle is outrageous due to its design. It is a completely unreliable car. I have owned the car for 3 years. It has brokendown and needed towed 4 times. Each time I was told that the part with the problem 'wears quickly' and 'it is not unusual to have it replaced'."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2001,eugne, 07/04/2007,Good car for 3 years only,4,"I was driving PT cruiser since they first appeared in 2001. I loved this car. Utility, fun to drive, look, everything is good. Except reliability. After 3 year and 15,000 miles I replaced rack and pinion.  At 30,000 replaced computer, engine harness and other details. If you want this car, you must  buy extended warranty, or better yet, keep it for only 3 years. I paid too much for not having extended warranty and Chrysler corp does not care. Finally got rid of it and no more Chryslers for me. Only imports. "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2001,Happy owner, 09/26/2007,Happy owner,4,"I have owned my PT Cruiser for over 5 years, which is the longest I have ever owned a car.  I can't find anything on the market that I like any better.  I have spent less than $1,000 in repairs over 5 years and it is going strong.  I'm sure when I buy a new car one of my kids will be driving it for another 10 years."

a car in this size."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2001,roro, 11/03/2007,Practical and reliable around-towner,3,"I've had great experience with this car, now nearing its end.  The car has always run well and trouble-free, except for a cat converter replacement at about 110,000 miles. It drives well for a tall car, and with a stick shift it is fast enough.  Loads of room to haul stuff. (I can get a couple of mopeds in the back.) I think it has been much underrated for practicality and utility. People think only of style when they think PT's, but that is hardly the whole story."

Edition.  I wanted this car for three 
years and it has lived up to my 
expectations.

What I love most is the design and 
attitude.  Three years after the 
Cruiser first appeared on the street, 
it still turns heads.  I do not find it 
disturbingly underpowered, and my two 
large dogs can walk around the rear 
with the seats down.

If kept clean and shining, this car 
makes people smile.  I'm all for that!"

but this vehicle has been 100% spot 
on.  From delivery to over 30,000 
miles: zero defects, zero problems.  
Change the oil and enjoy.

Loaded with everything on it except the 
roof rack. Everything continues to work 
perfectly.  From cross country trips 
with 4 adults, to hauling sod, Its been 
hands down excellent.

Could you find a better vehicle?  I'm 
sure you can... for twice the money.

The dealer experience has been 
outstanding.

Would I buy another?  You bet! But this 
time with the turbo.  (Maybe a turbo 
convertible next year? - Chrysler, are 
you listening? - Put the turbo in it!)"

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2001,why pt, 03/26/2002,PT pity,2,"2002 Ltd has 7000+ mls on it.  Sure it has a lot of features for the price, but what is with the build quality?  Drivers window rattles from day one.  About 3000 mls lower dash lights stopped working.  At 7000 mls the vehicle rolled backwards in park with key out of the ignition.  And most recently I had an accident from brake problems at highway speed.  But Chrysler had a special investigator look it over and he said he couldn't find any error codes.  So in his opinion there is nothing mechanically wrong with it.  Good for him, he can have the car.  I will NEVER drive it again.  I am trading it in, and it looks like Chrysler is unwilling to help me at all.  How very Ford/Firestone of them."

Thankfully an extended warranty was purchased because the transmission went on it two times and the radiator had to be replaced soon after I purchased the vehicle. Other than that, the car was perfect. I love and miss my PT cruiser. I was rear ended. My two children were in the back and did not have a scratch.

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2001,Rod Grodt, 04/03/2018,Great Second Car,5,"We bought our Cruiser Limited as part of an estate sale for $1,500. It had just 131,000 miles on it. The car had been hit on the left side, so that door is not from a limited. When they replaced it, they put manual (toggle control) mirrors on it which I replaced. We can't seem to get a remote to program, but are content to unlock the passenger door and use the electric lock function to open the doors. The car's only problem since we purchased it is a sticky ignition that sometimes locks up. Other than that, no problems. The car is comfortable and performs reasonably with the 4OD transmission. There is a ton of cargo space and the interior configurations are amazing. It's great around town and great on the highway, cruising nicely at 70-75. It's tight and there is virtually no wind noise. We bought it as a second car, but it's more fun to drive than our new one. It was Motor Trend's Car of the Year in 2001 and I can understand why.

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2001,ssjmerfolk, 07/22/2019,Good car in suburbia,2,"I bought this 01 pt cruiser with 48k miles on it. It has been okay as a car. Incredibly fuel inefficient for the size and power of the car. With such poor fuel economy, I expect all wheel drive features or more horsepower. The car would be a great car for someone in a mild climate with flat terrain. In Vermont, this car is dangerous to drive during the winter and can barely get up a paved road with a hill on a clear day. The handling is clunky at best with a wide turn radius and a strange weight distribution. Don’t get this car if you have any commute or drive in the winter. Summer driving to the Senior center and back seems appropriate."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2002,Brent, 01/20/2016,Love/Hate relationship with my Cruiser,2,"I bought this car from a coworker after some financial difficulty forced me to get rid of a car with a payment.  I paid $1500 for it, so thankfully I didn't spend much up front.  The previous owners had not driven it for a few months, so they put a new battery in it for me.  For the first few months, I really had no complaints.  The car definitely showed its age (it was 11 years old with about 120k miles on it when I got it), as the interior was pretty worn out and the bumpers were faded, but overall the car looked good for its age.  I noticed one day that my air condition started blowing hot and looked at the dash and saw my car was overheating while sitting at a stoplight.  Took it to my mechanic and he replaced the radiator, after telling me that I should probably get rid of this car, as they are notorious for radiator and cooling system issues.  I wish I had taken his advice.  I'm currently on my 5th radiator, and I've had the thermostat, the radiator cap, the fan, the fan switch, numerous sensors and wirings, two batteries, new tires, and an alternator replaced.  The car still overheats, and I have to keep antifreeze with me at all times.  My mechanic believes it's leaking out through the head gasket, so it's most likely torn to shreds.  The A/C went out completely last summer, and the compressor has a massive hole in it.  I've spent about $5000 on a $1500 car to keep it running.  Now, for the good things.  Honestly, I enjoy driving my car.  It's comfy and roomy.  I drive in town and on long drives (1+ hours) and my legs don't get tired like if I'm driving a car.  I enjoy that it sits up a bit higher than most cars, so it's much easier to get in and out of each day.  It's quite fun to drive, and has plenty of power for a car it's size.  The car has tons of extras and options, like a moon roof, PW/PL, tilt/cruise, premium radio, and heated seats (which is super nice in the winter).  It's not loud driving it on the highway, and it drives very smoothly.  It handles snow and ice like a champ.  I am looking into getting a more reliable vehicle quite soon, but in a way I'm sad to get rid of my little headache of a car.  It's not very reliable, but in so many other ways, it's a perfect fit.  Be wary buying a used PT Cruiser.  They have lots of issues among all the model years it was produced.  If you need a reliable daily driver and don't have time or money for frequent repairs or breakdowns, I'd avoid it.  If you're looking for a fun car to drive or as a second car to play around with, go for it.

The only other problem I had was my timing belt went out. It's durability is amazing. I ended up having a few accidents in it before I totaled it when a deer hit me. It drove so smoothly. I totaled it with 119,000 miles on it. It was great while I had it. "

The timing belt went out which was around 1,000 dollars to fix. We ended up putting over $2,000 into it, then 6 months later it broke down again. Then 3 months later it broke down again. OVerall it was a good car until the miles got up there. Also has a horrible resale value. The value decreases very quickly. If it has low miles its a great car. Very roomy."

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2002,Lee Rhodes, 03/19/2016,"P.T. Cruiser, great little runner!",4,"This car has been a joy to own. I bought this one used in 2007 and it has been consistently reliable. The only issues I have had are age related. A crack in the dashboard (which was completely preventable had I only bought a dash cover), both hydraulic pistons which hold up the rear lift gate need replacing, The headliner is just now slightly peeling back from the front window edge, and the cruise control failed which is caused by a module which Chrysler has known for years was faulty yet continued to produce and install in many Chrysler models including its mini vans. Just recently, this 13 year old vehicle is starting to burn a little oil. It loses a quart every 6 weeks. However an engine rebuild for this car is only $1600 which is surprisingly inexpensive and takes only 10 working days. The PT Cruiser shares the same chassis as Chrysler's Neon and the PT cruiser is a much heavier car. I have an automatic transmission and it is supplemented by a K&N breather kit which improved gas mileage by almost 2 miles per gallon. This car currently has 178,000 miles on it and if I rebuild the engine I am confident I can run it for many years to come.

I do not know why I bought the second one.
Both had the same problems - replaced radiator $1200 both times; suspension problems with tie rods, wheel hub assembly.
If I open the hatchback it causes my brake lights to fail, because according to Chrysler dealership, the wiring rubs as I open the hatchback.
The camshaft sensor had to be replaced $350. Now it is going out again after being replaced by the Chrysler dealership less than 8 months ago.
Very expensive to repair.

Few months later my fog lights wouldn't turn off, which killed my battery stranding me many times. I had to remove the fuse that controls it. Currently my car makes a horrible noise (similar to a cats fighting) only when I turn to the right. It also makes horrible sounds when I first turn it on and drive.

We just spent 1500 dollars on repairs this winter and today she called and her steering wheel is locked up and won't turn."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2002,Shotgun, 02/20/2010,Still like the car.,4,"Bought the car used in 2005 at about 56,000 miles. Have thoroughly enjoyed the car. Haven't had many problems, but when I did, I was appalled at the repair price, and the unusual failing of parts that normally don't fail. In 2006 the transmission failed. Cost $3,250 for a rebuilt one. Since then, the sunroof has jumped the track and screwed up the linkage. No 'repair parts' are available from Chrysler. Cost $1,200 for a new one. Then the starter when out. Cost $500 to fix.  It's time now for the timing belt replacement (95K miles)& dealer quoted about $1000 to replace it (includes new water pump). Transmission is acting up again but may be low fluid problem. I just topped it up & so far ok."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2002,Blaze, 05/06/2010,Love my PT Cruiser,4,This Hot Car is so comfortable. I smile each time i walk up to my Cruiser. I still can not believe it is mine. The leather inter. is so classy. Every stitch is perfect. Turning corners is a breeze. Handles like a Rod.
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2002,Jamie Clemons, 03/04/2015,Cat with a PT Cruiser,4,We go a used PT Cruiser for a steal and have not had any major problems with it. We really enjoy driving it. It is like any other car you have to take care of it. It has all sorts of bells and whistles power everything and a moon roof. Its comfortable and fun and me and my wife both like it. 
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2002,Kbtoys, 04/24/2007,Longterm Lemon,2,"This car has no go, and uses more gas then my truck. Just traded in with 88,000 miles on it and was lucky it made it. Once the car hit 80,000 miles everything fell apart. Sensors kept going out every 2000 miles. Something with a transmission sensor went out and had to get the car towed. Save the trouble and buy something else."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2002,Steph1163, 04/11/2008,Love my PT!!!!,4,I bought this car in 2006 with only 2800 miles on it!  I got very lucky.  I have always had great luck with the car.  The only problem I have had is that the light cover for the windows roll up fell out.  My PT has been the most reliable car I have owned!!!
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2002,Ernie Weber, 05/01/2008,Body Creaking Noise,4,Wife and I love this car which now has 79000 miles. Trouble free with great ride and handling and versatility. For the past year we have had a creaking noise in the chassis. Local mechanic cannot locate nor could local dealer. This noise occurs primarily after coming out of a right hand turn. Not while driving straight. Bouncing up and down while standing still fails to duplicate the noise. Has anyone had this problem and how was it fixed?

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2002,Andrea G, 12/03/2008,Very Pleased,4,"My husband and I purchased our PT Cruiser used with almost 60,000 miles on it in 2004.We have driven it a total of 29 months. It sat for about 9 months after being hit by a mid size SUV on the passengers side while riding in town. My three kids were in the car and everyone was safe.Today the car has almost 108,000 miles on it and drives great. We have had to replace the following items: rotors, brakes, calipers, tie rods and the radiator. The repairs were not as expensive as I had expected. I am often recieving compliments on the vehicle. I drive anywhere from 40-60 miles daily for work and couldn't have been happy this past summer with the price of gas being what it was"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2002,CrUiZeR, 10/07/2009,Love this car!!,3,"I've owned a 2002 PT for almost 4 years. Bought with 60,000 miles, now have just over 100,000. Have had VERY few issues with this car. I never head out in the morning with the fear that the car won't start or get me where I'm going. Runs great and gets some good speed on the freeway. Not everyone's cup of tea, but the car is beautiful, especially with a spoiler, chrome accents, and aftermarket mags. Interior is well designed and comfortable. Would recommend this car to anyone looking for a nice family car. Now I'm just looking for something more sporty."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2002,Yankeemare, 09/17/2008,We have a Love / Hate Relationship,3,"I LOVE this car and HATE the constant repairs!  2 full sets of brakes in 3 years, new transmission at 80,000 miles, fog lights won't turn off - had to have the lights disconnected, but the LCD interior light stays on all the time, engine overheating, water pump, thermostat, timing belt and serpentine belt being replaced as we speak (97,000 miles).  I love the design, comfort, interior, passenger and cargo capacity, and it's very easy to get my grandson in and out of his car-seat in the back seat.  I'm shopping for another hatchback but it sure won't be a PT Cruiser and that makes me very sad.  If Chrysler could up the reliability quotient, I'd be a PT Cruiser buyer / owner forever"

a bit of a mid life crisis??? Maybe 
just a little as I did not go out and 
buy the expensive sport car...anyway 
the car is very cooooool and great to 
drive.  I think the pick up (engine) is 
pretty good, of course could be a bit

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2002,budoinst, 07/18/2002,Fun car,4,"We just purchased the Cruiser and got 
it loaded---Woody, sunroof, spoiler, 
etc. Unusally quiet, solid and fun to 
drive around. Extremely well done 
interior and exterior and very 
comfortable. The automatic could be 
better suited in gearing, but gets me 
where I need to go. The braking and 
handling are first rate and the 
accessibility and combination of seat 
movement is staggering and well laid 
out. A fun car that could only use a 
bit of power boosting."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2002,PW, 08/08/2003,A Luxury Car It's Not,4,"The car is excellent for what it's 
supposed to be.  However, if you are 
use to luxury, you won't get it here.  
You'll get lots of space versatility 
and reliability.  You won't get power, 
fuel economy, or luxury.  The noise 
level is high, and the stereo hard to 
hear with any real quality.  We have 
tried for 2 years to love it, but 
failed."

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2002,ct, 06/07/2006,not tickled,3,"Since purchasing this car in the last year I have had to replace the battery , 2 starters, and now the transmission due to transmission pump failure which affected the gears and no warning from engine light until the car was dead on the road. I am not confident in driving this car. Also the a/c needs beefing up and the gas milage is awful. The brakes constantly have to be adjusted and always squal.I feel i may be at the beginning of an electrical problem. This car was babied from the first owner and also by me. For the car only having 49,000 and 4 years old this is no Dream car. Don't let the looks deceive you......."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2002,PT Cruiser Reliable, 07/27/2006,PT Cruiser is Reliable,4,The PT Cruiser is a very reliable car with routine maintenance.  I have owned a different model car with each of the 5 new car purchases I have made in my lifetime.  I would rate the Cruiser as one of the top.  It is very reliable and has not had any major repairs.  I stay very close to the maintenance schedules and have driven this car all over the US in every sort of weather without issues.  I plan to give this car to my soon to be licensed teen.  The leg room and posture makes you feel like your driving a mini-van (I had an knee injury and a stretched out leg wasn't feasible).  The ability to remove the back seats make it as convenient as a van if you need to carry lots of cargo.  
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2002,tommy, 08/05/2006,MY PT,4,"My family bought our PT Cruiser in August 2002 about 9 months after my aunt had just bought one of her own. Compared to our other Daimler-Chrysler models (97 Jeep Cherokee, 03 Dodge Dakota) The PT has held up the best, gets the best gas mileage and the biggest problem we have had with it is changing the tires at only 20k.  Our repairman said that DC has been putting low grade (20k or less) tires on all new models in order to save money."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2002,Ray, 12/19/2004,Think before you complain,4,"People should think a little before they complain about the power or engine size or handling. The handling is harsh b/c of what Chrysler had to use to keep the cargo area spacious. The engine compartment cannot fit a I-6. It costs less than $20,000 base. You can't add AWD b/c of the aforementioned suspension issues. Don't complain that it doesn't have it. "

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2002,Joe, 01/14/2007,many problems with my '02 PT,2,The reliability of my pt cruiser is terrible.  After the warranty ran out the dealer finally figured out what the problems were. I am putting $300 oxygen sensors in my car every 2 months. I will never buy another chrysler product.

Nothing major happend except for the very poor gas mileage, and there is no performance at all. Second year brakes and suspension went out. Had to replaced the front and rear brakes and the vehicle only had 50,000 miles on it. Also at the same time the struts go out. Third year major problems, transmission will not shift gears. Had to get it towed and no one knows what to fix. Never again."

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2002,Amelia, 09/23/2018,My first car,5,"I've drove other cars before, but this has been the most functional car I've been in. I got a great deal for the car, 3.9k for a car that's done 40k miles on it. The air conditioner is great! I got it in the summer and it has helped my experience! Not only that but I love the seat warmers!! Actually, that was the most surprising thing haha, a 2002 car with seat warmers?! Nice... Now, I have noticed a few things with it-and it might be because of its age?- but it's slow when it comes to accelerating. Example: I have a upward hill leads to a highway and I find it takes longer to go to 60 when needed too. I learned that you really have to put your foot down. Another thing is that the car is poor at turning out, like when I come out of a parking lot I have to make sure I turn hard. The car does wide turns, so if you consider this car, make sure you get the feel of it's turns. Overall, I think this is a great car for first time drivers. The car is really great in that I can see over my shoulder a lot better :) Also wanted to note that almost everyday I find a new function to the car, like a coin sorter! The biggest thing I worried about the car was safety, especially when I did more research, however, I would say after driving with it for months, it's a very safe car. It brakes hard, has traction, I had no problems with the transmission, etc. Overall, I got a grandma car, it was probably only used for local shopping haha. I love the car a lot!

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2002,barbara vauter, 02/14/2019,Pablo Cruise,5,"This is a great car, fun to drive, tough and classy at the same time. My PT Cruiser was a Touring with only basic equipment: automatic transmission, ac, power steering, am fm radio and cassette player, sunroof. Now for the one big drawback: It's difficult to service. Two different very good mechanics told me the insides were built in such a way that it took a lot of labor (a long time) to do repairs. So be aware that the labor costs might be a little high. Some PT Cruiser owners have also had engine/transmission problems and suspension problems. Yet everyone who owns one of these cars loves it!

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2002,WinDaddy, 05/24/2007,Happy in my PT,4,"I've got 106K miles now and haven't had any problems with the car. There's a slight clunking from the rear occasionally under hard cornering just recently started. I understand it's worn suspension bushings on the rear, so I'll be replacing those soon. At 40K I installed aftermarket springs and shocks to improve the handling. A bit stiffer ride, but well worth it. I also installed a Borla aftermarket exhaust and AirRaid intake. It has a nice growl, and power is OK with the 5 speed manual. I would not like this car with an automatic. Just replaced timing belt- it's more expensive than most- you have to disconnect A/C hoses and raise the engine up few inches."

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2002,Travis Culver, 12/28/2005,What a disappointment,3,"There are lots of high reviews for the PT...this is not one of them.  This thing LOVES the shop, rocks and gas stations.  In the 3 years we've owned it, it has had 3 of 4 window motors replaced, approx. 8 windshileds (no, not kidding) a rebuilt transmission, squeaky brakes, a bad EGR valve, and malfunctioning fog lights. Even though my wife and I love the PT for it's looks and functionality, we are sick and tired of the cost of gas and the trips to the shop.  If the tranny hadn't one bad less that 500 miles within it's 70,000 mile warranty, we would have been in for $3,000+ in repairs. Wish I could say better things about a car we had high hopes for, but just wishing we'd never bought it."

Bumps that used to torture my old cars are all but forgotten in this one (I mean, you feel them, but you don't FEEL them).  Yes, it has its negatives--a light weight that makes me question its winter fortitude, and 20-25 mpg is a lot less than what I'm used to--but I kept my old car for those things.  Overall, though, it's a great car.  Granted, I haven't had it very long--but if anything goes awry, I'll be sure to write back!"

Also kids are grown so no longer needed the size. My only complaint about this PT is gas mileage and power. I'm getting about 20-22 mpg comb. Which isn't great for a 4 cyl. but I was getting 13-15 mpg on van. I put $55 filled it and got almost 2wks. Also running AC. So it's better. The van to fill was nearly $100. Wish engine was a bit more powerful for getting out of sticky situations, but it's not bad. But I love the style. Mine is pearl blue, mint and chromed out. it's a head turner. It's built great, nice and tight and this one came w/every option so it's blast to drive. I'm having fun with it"

comfort of the seats. They seem a 
little too shallow (short from back to 
front). I'd like better gas mileage 
but it's good for the type of vehicle 
it is."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2002,dvdirv, 08/15/2002,My First 4 Months With the Cruiser!,4,"The PT Cruiser is a vehicle that is 
hard to describe:   part car, part SUV, 
part truck.

It performs well on many levels 
including comfort, smoothness and 
quiet inside the cabin.

It's shortcomings are primarily the 
low MPG for such a size vehicle (21-
29).  "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2002,Wyatt's Mom, 08/14/2002,IT'S FUN TO SHOW OFF!!!!,4,"I HAVE HAD MY CRUISER A YEAR AND A HALF 
AND LOVIN' EVERY MINUTE... JUST GOT IT 
BACK FROM THE BODY SHOP WHERE WE 
CUSTOMIZED IT WITH  SOME GROUND 
EFFECTS. AT THE SPEED OF 90 IT'S SMOOTH 
AS ANYTHING AND DOESN'T SHAKE PASSING 
BIG TRUCKS. IT LOOKED COOL BEFORE THE 
GROUND EFFECTS AND WING BUT NOW IT'S 
DOWNRIGHT STRIKING. IT CAN GO TO CAR 
SHOWS AND STILL CRUISE THE STREETS. NOW 
THAT'S VERSATILE!!!  I ESPECIALLY LIKE 
THE INTERIOR ROOM. THE ONLY PROBLEM 
I'VE HAD WAS A NEW SUNROOF SWITCH 
REPLACEMENT. IT HAS BEEN VERY 
DEPENDABLE. I LOVE TO SEE THE LOOKS ON

disappointed in economy. Ride is good 
and firm, turn radius a bit wide. It 
could use some power, once it shifts 
from low, second is weak moving 
comfortably in multi-lane traffic over 
35 mph without full throttle downshift. 
Seats are firm, storage is good, take 
out rears are great, CD radio is nice, 
but speakers are weak. Exterior emblems 
have rough edges and snag most cleaning 
and polishing materials; bumper finish 
too rough (catches polish no matter how 
hard you try to prevent it)."

excellent.  This car is really a steal

PROBLEMS!! NONE. As most PT owners will
tell you it is a little underpowered. I
have that cured with my next PT, Which
is the 2003 Turbo Dream Cruiser II,

their homework before  making the Pt,
and did it right."

suspension.  Powered well, but not a 
muscle car. Stylish and well built.  
Dependable.  Short on trunk space if 4 
adults pack for trip, but otherwise 
very practical with flip down seats, 
etc.. No warranty issues here, but the 
plastic pull-out drawer under passenger

road ... Blew the doors off a hot V-8,

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2002,DreamCruising, 10/23/2002,Solid Ride,4,"I was concern about the high price of 
this vehicle, the low crash ratings for 
the driver (2 stars)in the 2001 models, 
and the poor gas milage (20-22 mpg 
city). Still, I have been impressed at 
how well this car is designed, both in

just very artistic. In time I have come 
to like this car a lot--crash ratings

been a very pleasant expierence. In the 
year and a half i've had this pt, it 
has not had, one problem at all that it 
needed to go back to the dealer for any

hauler the amount of stuff it can hold 
is surprising. Even with auto. trans.

The only bummer about my PT is the crappy gas mileage. I ran out of gas in Pasadena at 273 miles (for those with poor math skills, that's about 17 miles to the gallon)!  I have yet to get over 20 mpg and I've been watching my foot."

comfortable.  When you close the door 
or hatch, it feels solid and not flimsy 
like some other cars under 20k.  It has 
the best headlights I have ever had on 
a vehicle and it seems to hug the road 
very well for a smaller car.  When I am 
on the highway, the big rigs don't push 
me around."

interior is deceptively roomy, 
classically appointed, and combined 
with very unique exterior lines and 
styling. Removable 65/35 tumble seats 
nearly converts the rear to a bed and 
breakfast. The basic 4 cylinder will 
not give you whiplash, but will allow 
you to pop and go when needed.  Road

PT.  I like it's reliability, style, 
and comfort.  It is a well built 
vehicle.

The one shock I received today was that 
the front rotors are non-turnable, in 
other words they are throw away rotors 
according to my dealer.  I have owned 
other vehicles for many years and miles 
and I have never had a problem with 
worn out rotors.  My PT's rotors had to 
be replaced after only 30,000 miles."

It gets so much attention from the ladies that I wish they had made them back in ""the day.""  The gas mileage isn't as good as my 400 hp Vette, and it isn't fast, yet it has yet to show any wear or any problems. The looks would have worn thin though, if this car wasn't the most practical thing I've ever had.  The few complaints I read from other reviewers  seem to be related to having bought poorly equipped versions.  "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2002,speed42, 11/26/2003,wouldn't give it up,4,"I fell in love with this car the day I 
saw it at the Detroit Auto Show as the 
Pronto Cruiser.
Back then it was just a cute little two-
door coupe. Before it hit the lots, it 
grew two doors and lots more 
versatility.
Unfortunately it also gained a few 
pounds, and lost some sportiness. I 
wouldn't trade my stylish inferno-red 
hauler for anything. It's already 
helped 
me move twice.
I wish I'd waited for the turbo 
model, but I'm glad I got the 5-speed 
and cloth instead of leather seats. 
Also, 
the optional ABS brakes have already 
saved my butt a couple of times. Well 
worth the extra bucks."

It's not only fun to drive, it's a 
great hauler for my dogs, their 
crates, etc. It's amazing to have a 
smaller car - which I like - with big-
car room. (I know it's classified as a 
truck, but it sure doesn't ride truck-
like!)

Now, I'd keep this car forever if they 
hadn't come out with that incredible-
looking convertible. Will I get one? 
We'll see."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2002,gmh, 04/16/2004,A Great Alternative to Any TRUCK,5,"Had only minor initial problems. Fixed 
at no cost and quickly during first 
year. Clutch fluid leak, was still able 
to carefully drive to shop. Engine 
control module fault which actually 
caused no problem driving just kept 
idiot light on until module was 
replaced. Otherwise very good handling 
and power with typical mileage around 
town at or better than 25 mpg and 
highway miles 29-32 depending on speed. 
Normally as i use this vehicle for work 
loaded down. I changed my original 
tires at 63000 miles no bare spots just 
needed a little better tread depth in

another 5000 on tread left if winter

We have a 60 month loan which will be pd off this Nov., however, we have been told by a body shop that based on their examination, without $3,000.00 additional work completed on it, it will not be running by Nov.  Tire rods, struts, AC compressor, a bearing have to be replaced.  We have had problems with the quality of work at a local dealership closer to our home in Greenwood (not Eastgate, but Tom O'Brien). Defective tires, stripped lugnuts, one Mgr not ok."

vechicle that we could take others 
in.  All out other vechicles only 
transported 2 people.  Also we did not 
want to spend a large amount on a car 
that would be used very little.  This 
car will carry 4 adults and a child 
very comfortably and it rides like a 
much bigger automobile.  Also a luxury 
equiped model with all the options was 
priced fairly.  Fuel economy and 
performance are adequate but not 
impressive. Style, comfort, handling, 
and versatillity are great.  Very 
quite inside as long as all windows

designed vechicle and no problems at 
all.  "

that I can carry 2 large dog crates or 
3 child seats when I pick up my 
boyfriend's cousins from the daycare. I 
thought this car was too small and 
looks like a hearse. There is 
incredible space in the cruiser. The 
best part is that it doesn't take but 
maybe a min. to cool down a hot car. My

never completely correct the fluide

Drivers seat has been replaced. The clock won't keep time, and every CD played skips. On windshield number 4. They seem to crack from stress. Front windows have came off the track twice.

My wife picked out the car and I didnt care for it much until I had to transport some building material to the house. Although a small looking car I was surprised at the open space it has when the seats were folded down and the amount of weight it would carry. Was almost like an inclosed pick up and still drove very well.

While certainly not in the same league mileage wise as a Civic, try fitting a 36 inch TV in a Civic.You can't have everything.The PT costs less than an a Accord, fits the same amount of people and cargo as a minivan and has a much better engine than anything in its price class.  If you get 15mpg, you probably have never changed the air filter.  "

First time the dealer blamed it on a bad power steering motor steering motor and topped off the antifreeze.  2nd time no cause found.  3rd time found a bad fan relay.  4th time (58k mi) water pump failed, causing head gasket to blow, warping the head, damaging a piston & a ring.  2 weeks to fix.  Chrysler not fully honoring 7/100 powertrain warranty, making me pay ~$500.  Front discs & pads at ~40k.  Plug wires after 55k.

Overall, I like the car but its reliability isn't what I want. The 1st 2 years were great, but then one little thing after another started going wrong.First the headlights wouldn't turn off-had to get the car jump started and take it in to the shop. Then the horn wouldn't work. Then it started overheating-had to get the car towed in 2 times for that. Then the brake lights wouldn't work-got them fixed 3 separate times. Replaced battery several times, replaced brakes. If it weren't for these annoyances I would never buy another type of car-I absolutely love the ride, the look, the comfort,the room."

About the only improvement I would make is slightly larger front seats (the bottom- and I'm only 5'10, 180lbs)that are more adjustable. Thats it!

That's why you buy it. For those who complain about it's performance - go buy a sports car. This car, with it's 2.4L engine, was not meant to go 0-60 in a sec. Our Dream Cruiser replaced a 6-cyl. minivan, and the PT has more pep then the minivan (weight to engine ratio a factor). This is the MOST fun I've ever had with a car - and that is it's purpose.

Good pep, mileage (auto) at 22 overall right now, and it's climbing as I put on more miles.

All cars are compromises - this one suits me perfectly."

Chrysler intended the Cruiser to have the 5 speed as it's primary transmission, as it fits with the styling.  The auto is for those who want the look but just can't figure out how to drive a stick.  It's a given that an automatic will have less power and lower gas mileage.  That said, this car is a great deal if you get the base model with a few add ons (power locks, windows, CD)."

For the first half of a year I really enjoyed it, but suddenly in the middle of a winter it stopped shifting gears. After I added transmission fluid, it worked well till the spring. Once it got to be warmer the old problems went back, and the car would stop shifting gears whenever it likes. Now I went through three months of nightmares already  and need to pay about $2,000 for the repair, for the warranty is already expired. It was the last Chrysler vehicle I've bought."

I bought my car, and I did not know that one of the lug nuts was missing because it was covered by the large hub caps; 4) The paint job on these cars is mediocre-most cruisers I have seen have faded paint; 5) I do not like that you have to turn the ignition key all the way back, to turn on the radio.

Many of the issues are due to neglect and ""I'll fix it when it breaks"" attitude. These cars require preventative maintenance. They were designed with a European philosophy. European cars are higher maintenance than Japanese or American cars but much more rewarding to drive. This is my second 2003 Base manual 5 speed. Purchased and loved my new one in 2003 but needed a minivan so kept it 2 years/24,000 miles. Fast forward to 2019 and I just purchased an Inferno Red 2003 Base M5 speed with 29,000 miles on it. It was well cared for. I changed plugs myself, changed the bushings on the shifter cable and it runs like a dream. Fun. Peppy. Yes, most people don't or can't work on their cars. But find a decent mechanic, change the fluids especially the coolant with factory-recommended HOAT coolant and you will prolong the life of all cooling components. Same with engine oil. I saw ads for PTC's, many with over 200k miles. So the variable is the care. Lots of useful info and YouTube videos about repairs online. A good dealer is the best chance of getting good advice on engine issues. Specialty shop for suspension, etc. These cars will be collectible in a few years.

Only problem noteworthy is the lift gate hydraulic struts stick and Click really loud when opened. Only BIG problem, this car is HORRIBLE in the snow.  Will NEVER buy a car without ABS ever again.  Great for cruisin and moving stuff as it has LOADS of space, just really not recommended for northern states who get lots of snow."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2003,scott s, 07/29/2009,nice ..but complete junk,3,"When I bought this car,  it was my first car.  I was very happy at the time I bought it. I bought it for 10,000 dollors and ended up putting another 7 on repairs. I only had this car for 6 months.  3 of which it was in the shop. It drives Nice, but it has to many problems. I need a new engine.  The turbo leaked twice. The radiator leaked twice as well. The car overheated with coolet in the car!I am to poor to put that much money into a car .. So I traded it in for a 2208 Chevy silverado and gas isn't that much worse"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2003,willb, 09/02/2009,Dont think I would buy american again.,3,By day 8 check engine light came on. They did nothing more than reset it & it would always relight within a day or 2. This car was in the dealership more than at home the first year. so many things went on with this car I couldn't even begin to report it all here. They also always wiggled out of letting me use the warranty on alot of the repairs. So as a result I have spent thousands in parts and labor. Now that I have found a reliable independent mechanic and have replaced most parts on it its now reliable and fun to drive so many years later. The dealership was a nightmare from day one. Was called back after 1 wk to redo sales contract (from 0% interest to 5%) 
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2003,Fred, 09/06/2009,The best car I ever got,4,"My dad gave me my grandmothers Pt, and since I owned it, that thing has been a blast. I have only had to change the timing belts only about twice and that's it, That lil car saved my life I could Have died the day i got into a wreck but the air bags went off, and the safety cage and the firewall held up. That car was a troop and I loved it for what it was. And if you have anything to say about Pts i will knock it down. That was my first car And i beat my car up and ran it through rouge traines and it took it. P.T. guy forever "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2003,greg, 09/22/2009,2 year review,4,"I bought the car in november of 2007.  It is the 2.4l 5 sp manual.  My ONLY complaint is that the bumpers came with tape marks on them which looks like crap.  The seats are somewhat uncomfortable but still better then most Japanese cars.  For a 4 banger it has good pickup and go, though i hear the automatic is a different story.  It's front bumper is really low so be careful with high curbs on driveways.  love the amount of space inside and the versatility and number of configurations you can do with the inside.  I fit 40 8ft 2X4's with all the doors and windows closed! No major problems as of yet and i have 46K on her, so hears hoping it stays that way!  "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2003,krb21, 06/11/2010,Oh my goodness,2,"I hate this car! I bought this car as a graduation gift to myself and hate it. I've had it in the shop more than I think I've actually driven it. I have 123,400 miles on it which is a lot but even before that I've had the tires changed twice, the brakes make a weird noise, there is  a loud rattle on the back hatch door. This car has given me problems since day one. I bought it and the next year it failed inspection because the tint was to dark. I've never added anything extra to the car. Just need a good family car. It sucks gas! I fill up 2 times a week just from going to work, picking up my son, and going home. I wouldn't recommend this car to my worst enemy!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2003,Daughter Diane, 06/22/2018,Great for the older crowd.,5,"My Mother owned this PT cruiser and we took her on vacations to just about every National Park in the west.

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2003,Teresa, 02/27/2018,Piece of Crap from Day one,2,"I bought this car with less than 90,000 miles on it. A normal car would have lasted much longer. This one however lasted me for two years before the thing started to fall apart. The only good thing about it, is that I drove it to Baltimore to meet my favorite celeb Mike Rowe and even THEN the radiator hose blew off. Figures. The day I purchased it, the calipers stuck. Almost caught the wheel on fire. Then the front end started popping. I fixed the tie rods, lower control arms, axle, alignment, everything like that. A year later, the car began over heating. Then the coolant fan went. And then the popping returned and now it's leaking antifreeze and the calipers are stuck again! I'm no longer fixing this car and I'm planning on selling this hunk of crap. The parts are cheap - sure! The LABOR is where it gets expensive. It's not worth it. It's a pretty car, and that's about it. I say my prayers Everytime I leave the house because I don't know if I'll make it back in one piece. Stay away from this car! You'll go broke as hell!

Then again, most people who like their cars are out driving them and having fun, not sweating over a keyboard. I read the reviews and then went out and bought a 60k miles, fully optioned turbo/auto stick 2003 GT for $7,995. One owner, clean as a whistle and rides/handles/accelerates like a champ. I have driven it all of 40 miles and since buying it for my wife this afternoon. Will we still love it after another 4,000 miles? Will my good car Karma prevail? I'll write again, same time next year. Then again, maybe not -- if we're having fun. "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2003,RMorgan, 02/21/2016,Practical and fun!,4,"Not the quickest of it's generation or class, but with a 5-speed manual, it has good acceleration and better gas mileage than with automatic trans. Great use of interior space - tons of cargo options with folding and removable back seats. Very stable at highway speeds and good handling on winding roads as well. With four wheel disk brakes, this car stops on a dime!

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2003,Frisco Pete, 04/21/2010,Squeaky Brake Problem Solved,5,"Wife and I owned car for 7 years. A good driver on city street and very stable on highway with solid handling and ride. Engine has very good passing power on country roads even with four passengers. Front and rear seats are very comfortable for long drives [+200 mile]. Many passengers have commented on roominess and comfort when riding in car. I have performed all maintenance since purchased and found it easy to perform oil/filter; spark plug, battery and brake maintenance [see suggestion below]. We found PT Cruiser safe, reliable and a fun car to drive with a design that still turns a head or two after all these years. I think it will become one of the design classics down the road. "

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2003,Nancy M, 08/04/2008,Lemon Car,2,"I have had nothing but problems with it since I bought it.  The transmission has been slipping since 2 weeks after I brought it home!  The dealer's computer can't find a problem, so they won't fix it.  Now I'm past my warranty period and they tell me that the repair is at my cost! also, I had numerous problems with it that aren't supposed to happen.  The Strut spring snapped in half, covered under warranty (but should never happen), the engine mounting bolt flew out and took out my power steering pump with it (that should never happen), the battery cable spontaneously burned up (mechanic was surprised my car didn't catch fire!) and that should never happen,either! I'm trading it for a Honda!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2003,dsundancer, 10/08/2003,Ugly Little Car,5,"Before my wife test drove one, she only 
refered to the PT as, ""that ugly little 
car"".  When i was replacing MY car, she 
didn't think she even needed to test 
drive one as I would be the ""primary 
driver"".  Now, i don't even bother to 
keep a key for it on my chain as it's 
now, ""HER ungly little car"".  We both 
love the ride and the power is adequate 
to any task we can even imagine...and 
we travel a lot.
The seat flexibility is something Jeep 
could take a lesson from.  
It handles great, is quite spacious for 
even 5 and production quality and 
appointments are as good as it gets in 
this price range.
PS: I now drive my wife's ""old"" car."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2003,schatzieII, 09/30/2005,3 years ownership,4,"No problems at all. Added dual exhast and airaid system. Opened hood trim for ram air effect. Very very fast. Have automatic -it downshifts to first say at 20 mph... hold on.. smokes tires and the ride is wild. Utility is great. Best gas mileage on road 23 MPG. Get a boost gauge. Install on PVC line. I get 13 to 15 lbs boost.. 25 vacuum. Drive at 15 vacuum in city for best mileage. Turbo will save your butt getting into traffic. Stay low on chrome.

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2003,Roger, 11/12/2005,Dependable & Fun to Drive,3,"Fun to drive and quick to pass. 60 to 80 is a kick. Turbo is definitely worth the money. Very flexible with rear seats that fold, flip and fold or remove. Seats 4 adults comfortably. Wish it was a little wider. Car has been very reliable and really like the AutoStick. Allows you to take off in 2nd gear in snowy weather for better control."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2003,Gaguy, 11/13/2005,Try the Chevy HHV,2,"I have had more problems with this car than all my other vehicles combined. First off, the head gasket leaked oil before 300 miles and had to be replaced.  Then the ventilation system recirculation door opens on its own because the underpowered engine is not capable of providing enough vacuum to keep it closed when going uphill.  The infamously bad Chrysler automatic transmission went out at 31,700 miles and had to be rebuilt.  The mechanics had the audacity to suggest someone that I put something in the transmission to cause it to fail.  If they really thought that they should have refused repairs and given me the chance to take them to court but I think they knew they would lose."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2003,n1nj4r0u63, 09/07/2006,Eye Catcher,4,"To start off, the PT is a great vehicle. I love the 'hybrid'ness of it, as I can haul people, haul large items, or just book it down the highway like a racecar. The seating position is very upright and gives the impression of an SUV. I have grown to appreciate the centrally located window controls (though it still is a bit odd sometimes). The car really needs a warning beep or light when the head/parking lights are on, either that or standard auto on/off. Silver with standard painted silver wheels gives the whole car a monochromatic look that glistens in the sun and is easily recognizable, keeps the interior cool as well. Overall, a very impressionable car! "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2003,Wanabeeditor, 03/02/2007,"Truth about the PT, from a real owner",4,"Great car for the price. No unscheduled service stops or repairs after 27,000 miles. Just tire rotations and oil changes. It hugs the curves well on off ramps and loves to eat up 40-45 MPH curves with the cruise set at 55-60. The handling gives you a lot of confidence in the platform. Steering feel & effort is very good with a nice on center position. It takes very little correction to keep the PT in your lane. The engine is well suited at 150 HP to motivate our 4 speed auto PT just fine, low R.P.M. torque is pretty standard for a 4 cylinder car. Even the engine at idle sounds a bit retro which is nifty, but takes on a smooth feel/sound at speed. Hauls anything, great gauges and supp. seats."

I ended up hating this car 1 year later not because of its reliability but because of its looks. This car is definitely perfect for older people. Why anyone under 50 would drive this car is beyond me? Although, I wasn't forced to purchase, it was a regret. However, no big maintenance issues. I just think it has no sex appeal. "

tightly and stops on a dime. With the  
the traction control on the extreme

faster speeds, the tail end tends to 
float around. The interior has just 
enough retro but not to flashy. The

I looked at:

Pick-ups--not my cup of tea
minivans--definitely not my cup of tea
SUVs--never go offroading, never had 
problems driving in snow before
Vibe/Matrix--no low end torque
Protege Wagon--no power
Subaru WRX--not very quick with an 
automatic trans (which I need for my 
wife), no need for AWD

That brought me to the PT GT:
-it's fast, very fast
-handles as well or better than the 
Protege
-sterling build quality
-very reconfigurable for tons of room
-best looking of anything out there"

Well after 2 years I got my turbo! Its 
a hoot to drive, but has been in for a 
belt replacement at 400 miles, and a 
new drivers seat is on order due to 
bad leather on the side bolster( 
cracked and wearing at 2000miles). 
Also I got about 12mpg from the first

it to me. The GT is no race car but has 
PLENTY of get~up~n~go with 4 adults in

more driver friendly. My 2 biggest 
gripes are: the turning radius is as 
large as a 18 wheeler's and it's kinda

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2003,Lady Ech0, 02/19/2003,Buda Love,4,"I named my 2003 Steel Blue 
Cruiser ""Buda"", because it's rounded 
features just make you smile - like 
Buda.  With a 5-speed manual 
transmission, the car handles even 
better than anticipated, corners well 
at high speeds, and has lots of power.  
One thing to know, you must have your 
hands on the wheel while driving, 
especially on rough roads because the 
steering is sensitive to the road, 
probably due to proximity of linkage to 
wheels and axle.  But this is true of 
many cars.  The PT Cruiser is one of 
the best cars on the road.  I love it 
and I can't wipe the grin off my face 
while driving my ""Buda."""

driven a PT about a year ago, and was
underwhelmed.  The GT PT is another

turned off because you thought it was
underpowered, try the GT Turbo."

The back liftgate wouldn't open so I had to take it in for that. The AC fan went kaput one summer in S. Alabama and shot out a lot of Freon on the H.P. discharge valve. I had that replaced 1 day short of owning it for three yrs. It wouln't idle worth a d, the dealer said the injectors were dirty and had that ""cleaned"" for a 180 bucks! (my bad) It started idling rough again shortly after that so I raised the idle speed myself with a little wire. I used it for a maintenance work car for three yrs and workrd great for that. It was fun to drive and held a lot of stuff, stereo was good"

SUVs, the PT fit the bill for my needs

fun to drive, really fun to drive.  
Sometimes I intentionally take the long 
way home from work.  Although it is no 
pickup, you can fit nearly anything you 
want in the back and/or will seat 4 
adults comfortably.  The Turbo, w/the 
heavy duty tranny and sport suspension 
make it a ball to drive.  I test drove 
the auto (w/slapstick) and the manual, 
maybe I am the last American male to 
choose a manual transmission, but the

And the funky smell that some others have come across is the engine coolant. I've noticed that smell last winter and occasionally when the AC is on. The AC doesn't get as cold as my first car did. But its comfortable. The rear stabilizer bar was not installed even though it's on the window sticker. It needs one for a better ride. The turning radius is not tight enough and there are a few blind spots if you happen to be five foot and under. Had some paint problems with the metalic paint. Dealer finally fixed. After contacting HQ. "

a PT.  It is fast and fun!  I've had 
mine more than a year now and I still 
love it.  Build quality has been 
terrific.  Loved Chrysler's PT ""Block

Daimler has done good things for this 
legendary US automaker!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2003,MRWizard, 12/09/2003,Hot Little Car,4,"Straight from the factory this car is 
FUN!! Compared to the standard PT, the 
Turbo handles better, stops faster, and 
has such features as antilock brakes, 
traction control, sport seats, 17"" 
wheels, and of course, a very 
impressive engine. From shopping malls 
to car rallies, this is a car does it 
all. A comment recently made to me sums 
up my feeling about the PT Turbo. I was 
recently at a ""luxury"" dealership, 
surrounded by 50,000 dollar plus cars. 
One very stately looking gentleman 
walked over to me and said: ""Boy, that 
is some car"". Boy, was he was right! By 
the way, if you buy one of these cars, 
you had better get use to the attention 
it draws.   "

The PT GT Cruiser gives me all I wanted.  I love looking at Tara (my GT's name) and taking her on long drives here in CA.  When I need power she gives it and when I need to haul supplies she accommodates with space to spare.  Chrysler did a good job making a unique styled vehicle with power to match her great looks.  There nothing on the road that looks like her except maybe an old Woody."

I have an older dog and it is a 
blessing to be able to fold back the 
back seats and let her enter the car 
through the back doors.  She then has 
plenty of room to move around as we 
take a trip.  It also has tons of 
storage room, which is great.  Being a

It handled well, looked great and was the first car I purchased that I actually wanted.  Sorry to say, I traded it in last November, 3 years later.  At 60K, the head gasket was leaking and replaced.  It had problems in the front end at 75K and had the springs, wheel bearing, tie rods replaced.  When I traded, the rear end was making much the same noise and I was looking at more, expensive work done.  Nice car, but if you drive like I do, it is not the most reliable.  And the gas mileage is as listed, very poor.  "

right at home on the freeway at

really has pep. Int is totally retro & 
cool, & stereo sounds incredible. 
20 Mpg nothing to scream about, but 
just a total blast 
to cruise around in. Cranberry color 
hard to keep clean, but put some 
effort, it is gorgeous. Nasty smell out 
of air cond sometimes, so 
watch out. Seems to be a ""norm"". Has SO 
much room in the back, can't fill it. 
Nose gets ""dinged-up"" easy, but 
touch-up paint ($12.95) takes care of 
that (or a bra at $150). So

addition and really completes the 
package.  The 17 in wheels are great 
and the handling is taught yet 
forgiving.  Granted its not the car you 
want for autocrossing but for spirited 
day-to-day driving (w/o baby).  This is 
a great car.  Cant wait for the first

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2003,Lingomaster, 03/13/2003,PT Bruiser,5,"My wife wanted a new car and the 
Cruiser was cute, practical and had 
sufficient space to haul antiques in. I 
agreed with her selection criteria, yet 
I was able to persuade her to wait 
until the 2003 model came out. I test 
drove a 2002 Limited Edition, which 
lacked some extra oomph to catch up to 
its cuteness and functionality. Our PT 
Turbo offers just that and more. 
Overtaking other vehicles is no longer 
a chore. No, it has indeed become a 
pleasure to leave others standing in 
place. Here, on the Autobahns of 
Germany, our Patriot Blue Cruiser feels 
right at home when it can strut its 
stuff at 100mph plus. My wife is now

Now the CV joint is slinging axle grease.  I bought this car new because of the reviews I've read hear, big mistake.

An oil sending switch, a balky airbag light, and resetting the trip odometer is the only trouble so far.  It does not burn oil in between 3000 mile oil changes.  Original tires lasted 40,000 miles as did the brakes.  Good on long trips and loves the highways.  I get 19 mpg in town and 24 on the highways.  Ride is firm but never harsh and handling is as good as it gets with my all season Yokohama performance tires.  Interior comfort is great for both myself 6 Ft and wife 5Ft.

Very comfortable for my 6' 2"" 290 lbs football defensive end-esque frame. I just bought a 03 w/ 14k Touring Edition Deep Red. My complaints are a slight vibration between 800 and 1200 RPM through out the car. I'm not sure if this is normal or something that needs to be addressed. All 4cyl. engines vibrate.

two P.T.'s, my first was a 2001 Silver
Limited, and now I have a Cranberry
Touring.  I use it more for a mini van
for my craft business. Soooo comfortable
to travel in and drives like a dream."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2003,Liz, 03/14/2007,I loved my car until recently.,3,"We bought our car new and loved it right away.  It has lots of room and can carry a lot.  I loved the look of it and I always thought I felt like I was sitting in my kitchen chair when I drove it.  Last year I changed my mind, I no longer love my car.  We have had it in the shop during the past year 8 times for the same problem.  It won't start.  The battery has been replaced 2 or 3 times, the starter has been replaced twice, the starter relay once and the wiring harness once.  The last repair did last for many months but we are back to the same problem again.  We would never, ever buy another Chrysler.  Very bad reliability."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2003,Cathi, 05/02/2007,"Cute car, poor quality mechanically.",3,"I was so excited to get this car. That didn't last long, we had to replace the battery the first week we brought it home. It was purchased new. We have replaced the battery 2 more times since. Head gasket leaked the first year, a/c has been out several times, radiator leaked, now the transmission is completely out, needs rebuilding. I have had this car only 4 years. Turn radius is limited, gas mileage is poor. Drawer under the passenger seat won't close without much difficulty. Very disappointing.  "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2003,AHUNT, 04/15/2003,It's Awesome!,4,"I have had my PT for all most 2 
months.  I love it.  The car handles 
well and has unbelievable accelleration 
for a 4 cyl.  Electric Blue Pearl is a 
beautiful color that goes great with 
the  17"" chrome rims.  Everyone that 
rides with me loves it too.  Autostick 
is good for quick acceleration in short 
areas (i.e. short passing zones."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2003,Peter, Paul and Mary,A fast Cruiser,4,"We already liked the Ltd, but this one 
is the best. It has all the versatility 
and room advantages of a mini-
van/SUV/wagon (except a third row of 
seats which is useless anyway) and 
performs like a sports car (~7 seconds 
for 0-60 mph)."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2003,Karen, 05/09/2007,Consumer Report said don't buy a 2003,3,"Too bad I didn't find out until 3 years later!  Replaced power steering pump, ABS is out, sensors burning out all over, replaced pricey turbo belts in first year, my dash looks like a Christmas tree with all the failure lights I have had to respond to. I love the car, but I hate the money I have to put into a car I am still paying for. Oh, and it has the turning radius of a brick.  But love the look and heated seats and all the really fantastic extras -- a ton of room, really great for moving!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2003,boomers pt, 09/04/2007,Not happy with performance,2,"Traded in 300m for Cruiser, have 77000 miles on it. I have had passenger side wheel bearing replaced 3 times and drivers side replaced once. Going on the third set of tires. Car is in the shop at least once a month. Numerous front end issues. Thank God I purchased the extended warranty. Added a K/N filter no improvement on gas mileage. Have had struts, tie rods, and numerous other front end replacements"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2003,Pickle32, 04/25/2003,Smooth and Fun,4,"This car is a blast. Not only does the 
turbo put a zip in your step it is 
such a smooth ride.  exceleration is 
great and the look of the dream 
cruiser does not go unnoticed."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,nightfrog65, 04/08/2013,Average Vehicle,3,"Wife owns one of these, so I get a chance to drive occasionally.
Not overly impressed with this car, but don't hate it. 

Acceleration is average, but the engine seems under-powered for the weight of the vehicle. The turbo version is better.
Wife's car is auto-perhaps the 5 speed is better suited for the engine.

Working on vehicle is difficult for many tasks given that engine is tightly wedged in compartment-changing timing belt and water pump is a real nightmare-I let the dealer do that job :) 

Styling is ok-wife likes it better than I do. 

That being said, it is pretty roomy on the inside-can easily fit 5 adults and cargo. 

Fuel economy suffers due to weight of vehicle."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,OverlordR, 09/01/2010,"Bigs good, littles--not as much",4,"I bought my PT GT used with about 37k miles. After the dealer performed a realignment the handling became quite good. I have been in a few low-speed front impact accidents, and the car has protected me quite well and been repairable. In a region of weather extremes (-20 to 105 degrees), I have never once been unable to start my car, outside of my effort to stretch more time out of my battery (college student). I commute to school, about 800 miles a week the last year, and the PT GT is quite an able speeder; it merges quickly and confidently on the highway and can hold 80 mph at a mere 2500 rpm. Much of the car is rock-simple, but the vitals (engine, drivetrain) are rock solid as well."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,citygal57, 10/29/2013,"A FUN-TO-DRIVE, VERSATILE CAR",4,"I purchased my 2004 PT Cruiser GT a year ago after an auto accident had totaled my 2001 Ford Escort (no great loss).
I had driven one previously as a rental in Florida and fell in love with it.
When I bought it a year ago, it was fully loaded, all chrome, leather interior, great sound system, automatic seats, sun roof, spoiler, etc.
It was a one owner vehicle and had around 55,000 miles on it; I paid about $6,000 for it."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,Hutchmonkey, 10/23/2005,One of the Best Vehicles I Have Owned,4,"The PT is one of the best vehicles for the money that I have owned.  Road noise is minimal, with no vibrations, rattles, etc.  The interior comfort is adequate, with lots of headroom and leg room.  I am 6ft/260 lbs. and am very comfortable in the driver's seat.  The only problem I have had was a ""skip"" in the engine - the dealer replaced the plugs and plug wires (free) and that took care of the problem.  Gas mileage averages 28-30 highway and 19-20 city.  The best feature is the versatility of the cargo space.  I do clowning/magic shows, and the storage space allows me to carry all of my props with easy access.  Distinctive body style also appealed to me.  This has been a wonderful car!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,turbocruiser, 04/24/2005,Enjoyable ride,4,"I've always driven larger vehicles and after looking at several PT's I decided on a Platinum series. I was suprised by the pep the turbo adds and the 'roomy' interior. I've driven the car about three months/2000 miles now. People constantly look and ask qestions. The car handles well. The headlights are bright, unlike our Caravan. The local gas mileage is at 18. Highway, well I've travelled across state once and the mileage wasn't much better. Probably due to the fact I couldn't contain myself. The car is a pleasure to drive. The mid-range acceleration is so smooth and quick. Yikes!!! Maybe the next road trip I'll set the cruise. Until then . . . ."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,MDH, 10/16/2009,Tranny at 65K,3,"I like my cruiser, but I feel leery of the reliability. I've replaced the control arm bushings at 50K miles(known problem) and now the transmission went at 65K miles. Luckily the tranny was covered under the 7/70K warranty for a $100 deductable. Just an FYI for anybody buying a used one, Chrysler will let you register the car for warranty coverage even if you are not the original purchaser(Im technically #4). I registered mine right after I bought it in 12/08. Just call them and say you want to register. Might just be the 7/70 warranty (2003-2004), so check.  I'm not sure I would buy another one, especially when I drive about 20K miles a year."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,Kathy, 08/07/2007,Pretty nice little car,4,"A good car, strong and reliable. Great around town, and fine on the freeway. The only problem we've had is with the idle when the AC is on, but if you turn the AC off it's fine, and we didn't notice this when we first had the car so maybe it's the AC."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,PT Gal, 11/14/2003,'04 PT Turbo Platinum Series,4,"This is my second PT and I can't find 
any negative aspects to report. 
My 'old' 2002 PT Limited Edition was 
great in all areas but power, it was 
just too gutless and had to be floored 
to get out of everyone's way. Hence the 
upgrade to my new 2004 Turbo Platinum 
Series. Stunningly sharp looking, 
chrome everywhere, luscious leather and 
suede seats, loaded with all the 
goodies I'd ever want .. and POWER! 
Chrysler really stepped up to the plate 
on this series. Bravo!"

mileage cause ive onyl had it for like 
a month. 6000 is an ESTIMATE. I have a 
2004 Electric Blue Turbo Cruiser, and 
I love it! The exterior is so cool, 
the interior design is a pratical as 
my wife's 2004 XE Limited Edition 
Toyota Sienna, which is the most 
pratical car in teh world, more than a

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,drivenitall80, 03/15/2013,I Rock this thing,4,"K, so i bought this inferno red 2004 pt cruiser gt with a premium sound system a year ago for my gf when someone totaled her focus, then we broke up and i kept the car because i was making the payments. Well ive but a crap load of asome bumper stickers on it, these awsome momo TEN-S black wheels on it, had the windows tinted, and every friday night me and my frreinds pile up into it and we go out cruisin and clubbing, i <3 this thing, we crank up the radio and roll all the windows down, its so much fun, i call it a chrysler party cruiser, i even actually have vynl stickers tht say party cruiser, and the way i take turns and sometimes DRIFT youd think the body was gonna fly off the chasis."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,Jimmy T., 08/27/2008,Platnium PT,4,"I bought this car because of high gas prices and my Explorer was a gas hog.  This car is a blast to drive with the turbo. Nice interior with chrome accents and leather and suede seats.  Platinum silver exterior paint looks real nice with chrome wheels.  Was surprised with fuel mileage, only gets 21 city.  Should do better. Brakes squeak when you first start out but stop after a few stops.  Checked brakes and they have no wear, a mystery.  But overall a great car for price. Only $9000 with 32,000 miles and loaded."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,Chris, 03/21/2008,Troublesome PT!,2,"We purchased our 2004 PT (new) in Feb 2005.  We are currently at 64K miles & are not happy campers.  We have had 4 service calls for engine jerking when starting the car.  Dealership did a tune up and changed spark plugs the first time.  Back to the dealership 21 days later (same problem), changed the spark plug wires (warranty).  Back again 45 days later because of defect with the new spark plug wires (warranty).  Now we are back again, but we are out of warranty.  We had to replace the tires at 30K miles.  We were told (by the Goodyear location) that the back end is out of alignment (from the factory) and cannot be fixed.  We have 2 Hyundais with +160K and have never had service issues!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,Front Runner, 04/09/2009,Saved My Life !! Truly Incredible Car !!,4,"This was the best car I've ever owned. 61,000 miles on the odometer and not a single problem with it, not even a light bulb.  The high output turbo matched to the 5 speed Getrag transmission would put an ear to ear smile across my face every time my right foot headed for the floor.  Towing my two waverunners or my fishing boat was a breeze and the temperature gauge never budged from midpoint. When it was tire change time, I upgraded to a 215/50R17 size Conti Contact and the vehicle just got even better.   The start of my review stated ""was"" the best. After getting tangled up with a Porsche on the highway, I slid sideways off the pavement at 65 plus mph and ended up rolling the car."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,PT Convert, 11/23/2008,Will be getting a 2nd Cruiser,5,"Have manual transmission, & has been the best MPG of any 4 cylinder vehicle I have owned - 33 mpg is top, but consistently get 30 mpg. (Keep records at every purchase.) Removed the back seats (takes a minute) & gas mileage went up by aprox. 3 mpg. Actually feels better on road without back seats. Hauled a washer, dishwasher & 8 ft 2x4's in it with no problems (hatch closed). Has more cargo room than Jeeps & Chevy Trackers. No repairs (normal maintenance)  or problems. Do my own oil change, & love the access to oil filter and plug. Wish all vehicles were that accessible. Plugs: only use standard, not platinum: these will cause running problems. Love it and want to get 2nd!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,Cody, 07/22/2006,Even Dad loves it,4,"This has been an awesome car for us. Reliable and safe.  Fits all of us nicely.  Even I love to take it out without the wife, and have a little fun in town.  It is definately a very underestimated performer.  I have shocked more than a fair share of Mustangs and import tuners.  I'm 6'2"" and 235 lbs and I don't feel cramped in the drivers seat.  We bought used with 2000 miles on it.  It was a lemon law car from Pennsylvania.  It was supposed to be some random electrical problem, but none was ever found.  This car hasn't so much as hiccuped in the year we have had it.  Will buy another Dream Cruiser this year or the next."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,ryukenden, 06/16/2005,GT Cruiser,4,"this is one fast car. engine feels like a v6 rather than a I4.  lots of pep for tackling hills and overtaking with stock ECU. stock HP and torque numbers are impressive enough (220HP / 245 ft-lbs.) but i installed the stage 1 upgrade. the 17"" rims with 50 series tires inspires confidence when taking corners. impressive cargo space. gotta love that versatility. turning radius is too wide for this vehicle but that's the tradeoff for having larger rims. the stock goodyears breakaway immediately on rain-soaked roads."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,gary rodrigues, 10/28/2006,great car,4,"this is a great little car and has multi purposes. it once fit a new 32"" screen door inside, by folding one rear seat, and the front seat.

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,RetiredPT, 08/09/2007,04 Cruiser,4,"I've had to make 2 repairs The lower control arm bushing at around 52,000 cost $530 and the cooling fan at 67000 $900.  I don't think these items should have worn out at the low mileage."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,LUVITTTTT, 09/19/2007,Very Fun,4,I've had no problems with the PT Cruiser at all. Much more power than I expected. All the controls are very handy.

Had some leaks in my d/w took it to the dealer found out leaking from rack and pinon which had to be replaced and solenoid which had to be replaced. I had the extended warranty as my car only came with 3/36. Cost me 300.00 with deductive,front end alignment and power steering flush. Trouble with the a/c 2x the warranty covered less deductible.

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,greenmamba, 04/10/2015,PT Cruiser Touring,4,"Bought new. Very dependable little car. Lost the transmission with 155K showing. The timing belt replacement was a lot, but for a ""throw away"" car, it's been fantastic. So much that we're looking a Chevy Trax because it reminds us so much of the Cruiser, BUT, the Cruiser is here to stay. Still looks and drives pretty good (a good ""ten footer"" now). Wish we had gotten the turbo. Will make a great spare now."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,disappointed, 10/01/2009,problem from the beginning,2,"My problem is that I have had multiple front end and suspension problems. In four years I have had multiple wheel bearing, three sets of lower control arms and numerous trips to the dealship complaining about the rattle in the front of my car. Now I have more suspension problems, a broken motor mount and a blow head gasket. It is a shame because I really love my car just hate the poor design."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,Sheila, 05/07/2010,Never Again,3,"Bought my car used w/low miles. The brakes have always squeaked, had checked twice for the same thing. They say they just squeak. Oil pressure light has come on several times for no apparent reason.  Check engine light comes and goes. Couldn't find out why. A/C went out the end of last summer, I live in TX and need air.  Now my ignition will not turn either way, so I can't drive the car. Mileage is the same as I got in my Grand Cherokee Laredo, maybe not as good."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,OldSchool, 09/24/2004,A Grandmother's Toy,5,"With more than 150,000 miles, and two 
grandkids, my wifes 95 Lincoln Town 
Car was showing its age in the form of 
repair bills. Its replacement would 
have to offer good mileage (something 
the Town Car didnt), versatility with 
regard to storage (the Town Car has one 
heck of a trunk), comfort (a Town Car 
signature trait), and style. It had to 
fit in with a stable of Retro 
Vehicles, which includes a 2000 Dodge 
Ram 1500, a 2003 Jaguar XJ8, and the 
venerable 95 Town Car. The black, 
2004, turbo, Touring Edition, with the 
chrome package fit the bill perfectly. 
My wifes only question is: Should I 
drive the black Jag, or the black PT?"

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,Christina, 05/13/2010,Worst Car Ever,1,"I had a 2001 Hyundai Elantra before this car and never had as many issues as I've had with the PT Cruiser.  Granted I purchased it used, but within two days of purchasing it the mechanical issues began.  I've had to replace the torque converter, battery, PVC hose, a torn CV joint and front left axle.  It makes a grinding noise between 45-60mph, vibrates during idle and starting first thing in the morning, and this morning it almost stalled on me while driving 75mph.  It's also very uncomfortable. I feel like I am sitting on a bag of rocks.  This is the only car I've driven where you have to push up for the wipers, not down and the window controls are in the center of the vehicle.A true lemon"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,rubbertoe, 10/10/2010,Cool looking good value,4,"Chrysler transmissions are fine they require proper service that means use the mopar fluid and change it when recommended. If you are not a mechanic don't mess with it. My pt has 70,000 mi. With no serious problems. The downstream o2sensor went out simple fix. A/c needs one can of Freon a year no big deal. Mileage isn't great but it's adequate I get 17 city and 24 hwy remember it's a wagon and it's heavy."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,Keri, 02/03/2009,Won't Buy Another,3,"I couldn't wait to get a PT after the bad taste my previous dodge had left...however, this car is just as bad if not worse.  In 2006 extensive engine work had to be done and in 2009 extensive work had to be done to the engine again.........the car only has 55k miles and the oil is changed as it is supposed to be.......wish I knew what the lemon laws were......this will be my last Dodge/Chrysler auto!"

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,Zarkster, 07/22/2010,Gave Me Nightmares,3,"I bought this car with 13K miles on it, back when Consumer Reports actually recommended the Cruiser. The first two years were OK, but then disaster struck. The whole shock system went down, struts, bushings, brakes, and everything else had to be replaced at around 50K.  The next summer, my transmission went KAPUT.  Luckily, the car was still under warranty.  Now, I've discovered that all the struts, bushings, axles, and rotors need to be replaced again.  This car has caused me to have nightmares about driving it down hills, and then going totally out of control and careening around corners."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,R. Taylor, 12/05/2004,This car is fun to drive.,3,I traded my well loved Neon R/T for this car and have been well pleased. I miss the quickness and agility of the R/T but love the spaciousness and versatility of the cruiser.
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,Dwighthp, 03/31/2005,Overated and no resale value,3,I bought this GT June 2004 the sticker was well over $26K absurd for this car! While paying far less it was still way overpriced for a econobox. Resale value is abysmal! I decided to sell the car after 3 months of liking it and the next 6 realizing it was a poor choice.  Those who claim not to have engine noise must have the stereo turned up. On the highway Chrysler's poor insulation with elevated DB levels and wind noise. Shut the doors tin can sound. Besides the Leather seats interior trim materials are cheap. Engine warning light turned out be a wire upgrade with plugs no factory notice. My suggestion get a Subaru WRX if you want performance and quality in a small car. 
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,Sherlena, 11/26/2003,Excellent Ride,4,"I have been keeping an eye on the 
Crusier, since they brought them out 
waiting for a higher performance engine.
After they brought out the Turbo,my 
husband and I decided to go try one 
out. I had my eye on a decked out green 
on with detail and the chrome wheels. 
We found out it was not turbo, but we 
tried both to compare and I do not see 
that much difference in regular driving.
Also, the regular ran smoothier and not 
as rough as the turbo, I was not 
impressed. We ended up getting the one

Perfect car to 'dress' up and is always getting attention whereever we go.  Changed tires from the factory originals and what a difference it maeks - now even quieter and faster !

At just under $15,000 this ""BASE"" auto has Air Conditioning, Power Windows..Power Brakes, A CD player with 6 speakers, a spoiler, deep tinted windows and alloy wheels. I really wanted a 5 speed manual for the fuel economy and the dealer was happy to sell it because most people today want the automatic transmission. (I think this car had been sitting for quite a while just because it was a ""standard"" transmission) Even with the 5 speed..fuel economy is not too good. Some owners I hear average less than 20mpg with the automatic. The fit & finish on these Mexican made cars are just outstanding! The interior is full of top grade materials too! "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,sweetc, 07/23/2006,Bought a Friday car!,3,Unfortunately my experience has not been great.  Although everything that has been wrong with it is somehow related to the wheels so this could just be a Friday car. Even at the dealership they couldn't understand why the wheel bearings were falling out or the brakes wore prematurely (there was a notch worn through them). I love the style and I love the versatility. Gas mileage isn't great for me average 19-20.

I like driving it, but the seats have to be the most uncomfortable seats I've ever experienced. Like a park bench. And it has no guts at all, none. The fuel economy is very poor. Much worse that the sticker said. The fun part of the car is all the extras that you can get. Unfortunately, the resale value is a joke. If you purchase from a dealer, after the 1st year, your upside down & it won't be worth even close to what you owe on it."

comfortable. Plus, it's really 
practical for hauling stuff (that's 
the story I told my wife, and I'm 
sticking to it). Almost no turbo lag 
(pulls hard from about 2000 rpm), nice 
handling with a little body lean in 
curves, but it's a tall vehicle, so I 
expected that.  I also drove the 
Limited turbo, but liked the seats in 
the GT much better.  I've had lots of 
compliments on how nice and how 
comfortable the interior is. If this 
car is as reliable as PTs seem to be, 
it will be my favorite car ever."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,taupismoon, 10/09/2004,The best car I have ever owned,4,"This is the best car I have ever 
owned!  I like getting in my car 
everyday to drive to work.  People ask 
me about it all the time.  What is it 
like and how does it handle.  I have 
never had a better vehicle before.  
Chrysler was inspired to build this and 
I just love it!"

now I love it. Dotta was awesome to 
deal with (thanks Anita).
Very comfy! Very cute! Great!
Only down fall: fuel economy.
I'm only 28 with 2 children... I'm not 
ready for a mini van. The PT was a 
perfect choice!
GREAT FAMILY CAR!! All of my children's 
friends want to ride in it."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,J.SHOCK, 12/07/2004,My rating suprised me.,4,"This car is great when it comes to 
comfort.  The gas mileage matches my 
2002 manual transmission Ford Ranger.  
The cruise control could be in a better 
position.  Transmission is a little 
jerky between 0-20.  Front wheel drives 
are usually like that with 4 cylinders 
wound tight.  When matched to a manual 
transmission, they will do that.  Great 
room for passengers and storage.  
Smooth and quiet ride.  Great handling 
on 15 inch rims.  Factory sound system 
stinks."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,wayne, 12/11/2004,Cool Vanilla GT,4,"This is a fun car to drive and with the 
turbo it will really get going. Two 
major gripes that I have is one, the 
blind spots are insane on this vehical 
and two, the cup holders will only hold 
a standard size can or bottle. If you 
drink fountain drinks that have cups 
that are larger than average like a big 
gulp you are out of luck. Other than 
that the car runs and drives great in 
my opinion. One other thing, if you 
smoke don't forget to bring your own 
ash tray, because it is not equipped 
with one."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,Doug Halby, 12/27/2004,Even Better the 2nd time around,5,"This is my 2nd buy of a PT Cruiser. My 
first one I loved (2002 Silver Ltd 
with Manual Transmission). I traded it 
in after 53,000 miles. After one test 
drive of the 2004 GT (Auto 
Stick/Turbo) I was sold on it. The 
Horse Power boost is incredible & a 
usable range for everyday driving. 
Autostick feature allows almost 
complete clutchless control on wet or 
snow surfaces or is fun to use when 
you really want to drive.  "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,Michael, 01/14/2005,Still smiling,4,"This car is fun to own. Performance is 
very good although it needs a 5th gear 
in the auto box. There is almost no 
road or engine noise at any speed. 
Reliability so far has been perfect 
(7500 miles). It rides and handles well 
and is comfortable inside. Mileage is 
good for performance - 22 around town 
and 27 on the Interstate."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,SCCA NUT, 02/20/2005,Don't Settle for Less than a GT !!,4,"My wife and I both loved the styling of the PT Cruiser, but during test drives and renting one on a Florida vacation decided that we'd buy one if Chrysler ever put a real engine in it. Well,  they finally did it!! In 2004, Chrysler put in a 220 horsepower turbocharged 2.4 liter four banger and followed it with a Getrag 5 speed tranny and limited slip differential. Who woulda thunk that my wife parked her chic car Cabrio and won't let me get the keys to the PT-GT. She comes home with reports of blowing the doors off Mustangs and the like. Good thing it has traction control!! Like the car you ask ??  No, we absolutely LOVE this car!! It tows our 2 jet-skis or our 16 foot jet boat with ease."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,Ace Gere, 03/04/2005,Car Guy gets his gal a car.,4,"I remember this cars info commercial. I really liked it then. Then the WRX came out and I forgot about the PT. Now that I'm married with a child the PT looked like a good choice. But, my wife did not want a hatchback. So, we were looking at small cars like Hyundai Sonata or Dodge Stratus. Loved the Sonata but out of my price range. (broke college student) When an old friend at a dealership pointed it out I thought my wife would shoot it down. Instead the willy old carsales man gets her into a Turbo Touring and she fell in love. We could not afford that one without braking the bank. They did have a certified used Non-turbo Touring. we bought it for less than $12,000. we love it."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,gary r, 04/03/2005,PT Does it all,4,Versatility is great.  Can be used to haul larger items with fold down or removable rear seats.  Head room is fantastic!  I would categorize it as in between a SUV and Mid size.  I can put 4 large adults in this car very comfortably!  Great stereo!  Easy to use cruise control.  Economical for every day use!!!  Quiet ride - no rattles or shakes!  Corners extremely well. Handles excellent in snow with Front wheel drive.  Long distance milage 30 MPG.  Accelerates strong.  No problems to fix!
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,KLP1102, 10/17/2005,Awesome Ride!,4,"We've even been to California and back, Since we had no problems, Three of us rode comfortably and had room for all the stuff, We're off to Nevada next! Our Nieces & Nephews even Love to cruise in it as much as we do."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,bm, 12/21/2005,Not Bad At All,4,"Comfortable and roomy. Seating is excellent, seats fold and remove for more space although they are very heavy. Mechanically sound except for an occasional miss in the engine too infrequent to worry about. Back brakes squeal, took it into the dealer and $30.00 later I was told there is no problem with them and they continue to squeal. Gas mileage is lousy and acceleration is poor.  I knew these problems before I purchased it and its pretty much the same across the board, ( gas mileage and acceleration) but am happy with the car, would recommend it to other people, and would probably buy another one."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,wayne, 08/14/2006,Swiss Army Knife,4,"After test driving a number of vehicles, I ended up purchasing the GT Turbo. The GT turbo has all the attributes that you find in a more expensive car, but most of all it provides for great flexibility. You can configure the interior to haul five adults and or items. It is extremely roomy in side, allowing entery into the vehicle ,with out whacking your head into the roof line, which is unlike other Chysler products. Contrary to other writers, I have obtained 20 miles to the gallon in the city, which I think is acceptable, for a 215 horsepowered vehicle. "

This car is still a 'Head Turner' and the dark gray platinum paint with all the chrome accents make a great package.  The car has great acceleration, and still gives adequate gas mileage.  This is the swiss army knife of autos with all the different configurations."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,Piggy, 01/08/2007,Speechless,3,"I just bought the car a few weeks ago with 40,000 miles. Thank god I bought an extended warranty because it is already going to the shop. My wife noticed a hesitation in the acceleration while driving down the highway, the new brakes make a lot of noise, and the engine makes a squealing noise at cold start-up until engine is warm. I hope that this isn't the beginning of endless problems."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,CalsPT, 02/06/2007,2004 PT GT,4,"Purchased the car new in 2003. The HO turbo makes it a blast to drive. The Auto-Stick is useful for holding a gear while descending hills. The car still exhibits good NVH, no squeaks, rattles, nor wind noise. The car was taken back to the dealer only once under warranty for a blown audio speaker. "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,Thos. Zachary, 10/19/2007,Ask the man who owns one,4,"The car starts well runs well accelerates well. Short wheel base makes the ride on poorly maintained roads is somewhat rigid. Winter driving is good. Trips to northern Michigan are pleasurful,gas mileage 28 to 30. City short drives with air on in is as low as 17mpg. Only poor features , Horn that belongs on a childs peddle car  and recessed speedometer shadows does not make reading easy.

Over a six month period it was in the shop 7 times for check engine light.  The first 6 months I owned it I had to have a rental car a total of 2 weeks.  These cars are very poorly built (in Mexico). Also, there is a lot of road noise.  The stereo is barely audible on the highway.  I will never buy another Chrysler."

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,Hayabusa4u, 08/09/2006,Great car with lousy engine,3,"This car was very reliable and I never had a problem with it, but is horribly underpowered. The gas mileage is awful as well. I was actually scared a few times getting on the freeway because I couldn't accelerate fast enough. I will never buy another PT Cruiser. To top it all off, the resale value is a joke. The car was not even worth half what I paid for it just 2 years earlier. I just bought a Toyota Camry and what a difference. It gets great gas mileage and can actually accelerate up a hill. I hope the next PT Cruiser has some power, and better resale value, because I really do like the styling."

There were no vehicles on the highway at the time. We took the car to a glass place and were told there were no stone chips and they suggested we take the car to our dealer as chrysler may cover the cost of a $900 windshield.They felt it was a stress crack.  The dealer told us the warranty for glass is 20,000 kilometers  and we were over that so were out of luck.We have contacted chrysler and are waiting for a response. "

Nice chrome accents, especially the

That's why I love the PT... it's as if

know if I really wanted one enough to 
take on another car payment.  Once I 
sat down in the drivers seat I was

you name it.  I even used the rear deck 
shelf for changing my daughter's

enough GREAT things about it."

car I've ever owned.  The interior can 
be configured in so many different ways 
that the car is useful in many 
situations that a ""normal"" car is not.  
I especially like the fact that the 
front seat can be folded flat and that 
the rear seats can fold, tumble 
forward, or be lifted out altogether 
giving you the sense that you have a 
small wagon.
I also have never been asked so many 
questions about a car that I've owned.  
People are always asking me if I like 
it.  They also comment positively on 
the Inferno Red color and the retro 
look.
The car has a very tight feel.  There 
are absolutely no squeaks or rattles "

easy to park,like a small car but has 
plenty of headroom inside, and feels

still have everyone in comfort. But when 
I finally went out and purchased it, I 
was proven wrong. This car is large on 
the inside, and has a great sound 
system. The moonroof that is included is 
a freat feature, althogh I did put in 
the extra for automatic and also for the 
ABS braking disk on the front. I also 
got the heated leather / suede seats

very satisfied with the comfort and the 
ride.  The gas milage is around 21 
miles to the gallon in-town, which is 
the same as my Chevy Venture. I 
recently drove it on a 750 mile trip 
and got about 24 MPG. The PT is a fun 
car to drive, but no speed demon since 
I have the non-turbo engine.  The  
problem I have had is that the engine 
died once at a stop light.  It started 
right back up and I haven't had a 
problem since.  The dealer checked it 
out and couldn't fine anything wrong 
either."

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2004,dougm, 01/15/2004,Things to know about the base model PT,4,"I don't know what all the fuss is about the 
non-turbo being sluggish.  Our 5-speed 
manual will lay rubber off the line.  Back seat 
looked like less leg room than our Neon, but 
once inside, due to the upright position in 
which one sits, there is actually plenty of 
legroom.  The upright position also allows 
for great visability out the front of the car.  
While waiting for our appointment to have 
the optional clear coating applied, small 
scratches have shown up indicating a very 
thin, non-durable coating of paint.

what is wrong and they just say

tracks or holes in the road"" which, 
obviously, exist on almost ALL roads.

I moved from WI to TX and hauled 9x its max load pulling a trailer. The car did not give out not even when I knew I broke the engine. Literally. Never did it leave me or my family on the side of the road. Best Car I have Ever Owned. I rebuilt the old engine and purrrrrs  like a kitty.... Update 6-1-2016, still have this car, besides changing the oil every 4,500 miles, I check the water levels once a month, and the oil levels, once a week. Its still by far the best car I have ever owned. I love it at the beach when I go fishing and I love it at work to and from. Minor issue, due to my hobby of fishing, I will need some work on minor rust areas. As it turns out, ocean water is not any cars best friend. Besides that, I'm at 180,000 miles now and still, the engine is going strong.

I can speak from experience - this car did wonderfully in a front end collision at 50 mph. I walked away unhurt. Now to the car itself: This car was reliable, never in the shop for any major repairs.  I loved the leather seats and seat warmers. The top is so easy to put up and down -  I commonly did it while waiting at a stoplight. It had decent trunk space and could easily accommodate 4 passengers. My major complaints with this car were the poor gas mileage (mid/high teens in the city) and the worst turning radius of any car I have ever driven. The car also had some pretty significant blind spots when the top was up."

Well, now at 50k miles and 7 years later, this has been the most trouble free car ever. The plan was to sell it and use the proceeds on a new car, but it still looks and drive as new, she still loves it and for the $5000-6000 it's worth, is still half what I paid 7 years ago. Huge value in my mind."

Basically there is plenty of room, with the back seats up, for my two hunting dogs.  This was the only reason I bought it, because of the large cargo area."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,aut0savant, 01/31/2015,Design Flaws Kill this car for me.,4,"The problems start by design. This car is not user friendly when it comes to roadside emergency. the way the engine is set up, its almost impossible to simply replace a tire under an hour. the spare tire retainer is bolted under the car that must be accessed from the trunk. If you ever wanted to replace your spare tire with a full sized tire, the retainer is far to small. 

The thermostat retainer is very poorly designed. Chrysler has made it in such a way that its almost necessary to remove the intake manifold rather work around/under it. When the thermostat seizes -- rather than have a high-pressure release, it will just rupture a hose (usually the smallest near the air filter.)"

You'll recall from my last review that I was still waiting for the parts from Chrysler which may/ or not come in December. I decided to search the web again for rebuilt parts. I finally found a company in Oregon that rebuilds the cylinders better than new. Better yet, they have an exchange policy that allows you to get the new parts up front and return the old ones for a credit. The Chrysler service team actually had to call them to find out how to install them, as they only know how to replace the complete unit (which you can't get)! I must say they were very helpful and I'm sure they never want to see me again. That's all for now!"

I don't know if there is a little something not right about it, or if its normal for a turbo, but it seems to lack power.  Taking off from a stoplight, the rpms easily push near 3000, but the acceleration is still just 'normal'.  Some days seems better than others, though.

Non of them even begin to compare with the drivability and fun that this little car affords.  Gas mileage is around 25 mpg, but it does have a turbo and 220 hp.

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Pt-cruiser :(, 01/14/2010,Lemon Pt-Cruiser,3,"since I purchased this car, all I've had is problems. -1st the door took air and was very noisy, had it 'looked at' 5 times to be told, that I'd have to like with it. -The the door take in water when in a carwash or when in heavy rain - Had had constant noise with the motor and of course when you take it in does not do it for them, grrr - Brakes  needed to be changed 4 times - the 'bouching' it's a suspensing thing twice - I had to buy the extendeed warrenty at a cost of 1200$, was less expensive to take that then the repair cost I had to place on it at a lil over 60k - then the a/c stopped working and had to get all 4 tubings replaced and had to par a 100$ detection, yada yada yada"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Mikey, 08/29/2010,Mr T's PT,4,"I've had my PT Touring Edition for 5.5 years.  For the most part it has been a very reliable, consistent performer. I'm a big 6'3"" guy and I test drove a lot of small SUV-type vehicles.  The Cruiser was one of the few that gave me plenty of leg room without banging mt right knee into a center dashboard console. I kept to the maintenance schedule and after 71,000 miles, other than front brakes, tires and a leaking valve cover gasket I haven't had to put any money into it. Now for the bad news - it has a very wide turning circle which is very annoying trying to park in tight spots. The mpg is not that great for 2.4 4 liter engine and the engine is dog while running the AC."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Pete Rackett, 02/28/2005,World's Best Kept Secret,5,I bought the PT Cruiser because I was looking for a car with van capabilities but not a van appearance or van handling.  I commute 150 miles round trip daily and the PT Cruiser is still a fun drive and easy handling vehicle.  The stick shift gives more than enough get up and go and it can carry a huge load with the two back seats removed. 
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,stu, 09/10/2006,cheep fun,4,"This car has almost been trouble free except for the gas gauge problem.  Three times to the dealer to fix <19 days total>.  Other than that its been trouble free.  I have 34,000 miles on it.  Very bad gas mileage only 19-20 in the city and not much better on the highway.  overall the most for your money than any car out there."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Sherry Griffin, 01/15/2007,"Fun, Economical and Reliable",5,"Love this car!  Really enjoying the sporty look and feel, standard transmission and one-touch control for the convertible top.  Have had my car for a little more than 2 years and it is very reliable.  The fact that it has a comfortable back seat was a big selling feature, too.  It easily accommodates four adults.  Gas mileage is 27-29MPG consistently.  Would recommend the PT Cruiser Convertible to all ages!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,JenniferDenise, 05/22/2008,Steer Clear of Chrysler PT Cruiser,2,"I've had nothing but problems with this car since I purchased it.  I barely get 16 mpg when I should be getting over 20. The car stalls when the air conditioner runs. It won't shift going up hills and has a lot of trouble taking off. The check engine light flashes during every up-hill battle.  I've replaced the brakes, rotors and spark plugs twice. I was told it needed a tune up which was done but the problems came back a few months later. I've now been told that it needs another tune-up. I paid 10,000 on the car and I've now paid over 4,000 in two years on ""maintenance"". My powertrain warranty hasn't covered the cost of any repairs to the engine or transmission. I'll never buy Chrysler again"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Missy, 06/16/2010,Frustrated with this car!,3,"First I have to say I love the look of this car (I have a convertible) and it is fun to drive BUT the problems I have had are disappointing.  First the computer was bad and it had to be towed 6 times before they found it. (That's me standing in a parking lot with a dead car that many times.) Luckily, then it was under warranty. Then the list began: the battery has exploded, the air conditioner went out and cost a thousand dollars, there is some kind of short they can't find that causes a pop and the dash to go out when I'm driving.  I could go on. It's sad because I love it but I'm ready to punt!  The amount of money I've had to spend on this car already is ridiculous.  "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,nat9, 12/31/2011,Worst Car Ever,2,"This car is the most unreliable car I have ever owned. Several ongoing challenges; I have had to change camshaft sensor, powersteering line, window motors would constantly stick and windows wouldn,t move. Terrible with gas, I have to fill my tank twice per week. A/C stopped working after one year, only blows hot air. This car has cost me so much money. I purchased this car January 2006 and have owned it almost 5yrs. When I first purchased this car I felt it was too soon to write a review. Very dissapointed that I will need to purchase a new car again. When I am driving on the highway, i feel like the wind will blow the car away because of the flimsy, lite material it is made of."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Mike C, 03/22/2017,High cost/&high repair cost,2,"The overall value of the car is far less than the value of the car. Ratio of 1/5. Because of the many problems, an hard to service per mechanics, an cluster panel failure, this car should be restricted to hobby driving to grocery store, but not suitable for city an high traffic driving. You will end up paying for it twice based on repairs.

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Steve, 06/16/2005,My favorite car ever!,4,"I've loved these cars since they came out and finally got a base model 2005 5- speed. It is the most fun I have had driving ever. With the manual, there is no need for a turbo, because this thing takes off when you hit the gas. I love the roominess, the feel, the drivability of this car. And I got a very cool color in Electric Blue which still turns heads! A great car!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Ron Sliter, 01/27/2006,Don't Buy One,2,"We purchased a brand new PT Conv and we have had nothing but trouble with it.  The original dealer was no help in repairing it and we took it to another dealer Integrity Chrysler Dodge with the same results.  To add insult to injury Chrysler Corp has been no help at all.  The car stops running for no reason and won't start back up again until it's ready.  I have had this happen at 70 mph on the freeway and at just about any other speed.  The radiator also cracked and had to be replaced and the car doesn't even have 10,000 miles on it.  Buy a Mustang at least they run and you can get them repaired.  I will never buy another Chrysler product and neither should you. "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,garcande, 05/31/2013,Still Got the PT Cruiser Blues,3,"Hi, it's me again. I've already told you about the AC going out and the top not going up or down. Now, after I picked it up from the mechanic the last time it started making a thumping noise in the front right. I thought it was something the mechanic had done, but no, it was the right front motor mount! Now, Chrysler recommends you PULL the engine to replace the mount, but my man said he didn't have to do that. Only cost $700 this time. And by the way, he said, there were only 2 out of 4 bolts holding the mount on and that's why it broke! Also only 2 out 4 bolts on the power steering pump at only 27K miles! To be continued..."

Oil light comes on every other time I start ignition...cannot be fixed after four attempts by two seperate service departments.  Smart Glass is not too smart when it's cold and we have any type of moisture.  Glass freezes and will not go up and down until the car gets warm enough to loosen the windows and worst of all is fuel mileage.  Sticker says 19 city/25 highway...hah!!! I baby the gas pedal or drive like a madman I get 18 in the summer and 17 in the winter. Sorry Chrysler, I have had it with your poor quality, poor fuel mileage and terrible resale value.

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,delrosen, 11/22/2008,Piece of Junk,2,"Avoid the temptation of buying this car with the thoughts of cruising with the top down. Severe suspension problem. Major repairs/replacements required, including control arms and hub bearing before the car even had 40,000 miles. Now the motor mounts have failed at 41500. Looking through other reviews, I see the same issues reported. Wish I'd found this site and read the reviews prior to my purchase. "

It is very fun to drive and my mom loves the car, but I keep it up. It is a very easy car to wash and wax untill you get to the lower grill in front. The engine that it has is only in 3% of pt cruisers so it's cool. The tires for the 18 inch wheels are expensive but look soooo amazing. "

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Buckskincolt, 12/20/2007,Pay or Pay,1,"Don't buy a high maintenance PT, you need to change plugs every 30k, they get pathetic mileage 20city/24hwy. Brakes grind like they are shot but they are ok, I've had a head oil leak that Chrysler had a service bulletin on but made me pay because it was 1k out of warranty? And check your used trade value!! This car is only worth $5500 trade in if it were a Honda civic it would have a trade of $9300. This has got to be the worst car I have ever owned, sure it's cute but beyond than it is a poor excuse of an automobile. American automakers at work. Where is Lee Iacocca when you need him. This car is a fall back to the 70's when all Chrysler products weren't fit for the road. Think, don't buy!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Andy, 09/20/2008,Third Cruiser,4,"This is our third PT Cruiser. We had  a '01,'03 GT, and now our '05. The GT was probably the best car of the three a lot of fun to drive and it was a 5 speed, the other 2 are automatics. Until now we have had good luck with the cruiser's. We should have researched this year a little more before we bought it. At 45,000 mile control arm bushing are bad, had to have them replaced, at 48,000 miles fan motor had to be fixed drawing to many amps when air conditioner is on. We do like the Chrysler car styles, but workmanship seems to be fair. Good thing i have the extended warranty 7/70000. this will probably be our last Chrysler product."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,LM, 01/15/2010,PT CRUISER,4,"WOW!!! Can't say enough positive things about this car. I purchased new 3/2005 changed the oil every 3 to 4,000. I have 185,000 miles on her and she purrs like a kitten. I've replaced brakes twice, tires 3 times and replaced rear shocks. My fault for using it like a truck. That's it. I haven't had this type of reliability from my Honda CR-V. What a work horse! Couldn't be more satisfied for the money."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Chuck P, 03/28/2010,Raditor,4,"This is a very reliable car, it's not going to win any drag races, but considering the fuel economy and the spacious amount of interior room, the car is very good. Only negative I've had; is I had to replace the radiator at only 70,000 miles, as the bottom valve was leaking, and not repairable, had to purchase another radiator."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Sunny, 06/19/2010,Desert Delight!,5,"I bought this car used (CARFAX showed one owner with low mileage.) I love and have always driven convertibles. This one has a very tight body due to the roll bar with very low noise and /or rattling for a rag top. I get about 24 mpg around town. It' perfect top down in the Palm Springs autumn, winter and fall. For triple digit heat (100+F) in the desert summer, the triple insulated top and forceful a/c keep it very comfortable. The interior is roomy, even for a 6'2"" guy like me. The ""theater"" seats put you in a higher position. I haven't had a single repair and the turbo provides high performance when needed. Fun to drive, attracts attention (I've had several offers to buy it) and reliable!"

Sure I've had some mechanical issues with it, but nothing that's left me stranded. Car came with the extended Chrysler Gold Plan that covered the front control arms (common problem, the bushings like to fail), the oil pressure switch (common failure in a LOT of Mopars) and the front wheel bearings. I work for a dealer so I know the issues these have (multifunction switch, wiper nozzles like to die, but the biggest problem was the control arms. The A/C suction line died too but that was also covered under warranty. Gas mileage sucks, but hey, it's a 220HP turbo monster convertible!"

We like how you sit up high in it, like an suv, very comfortable to ride in, stylish, and I am getting really good gas mileage. This car gets alot of attention with people wanting to race me. We absolutely love the color midnight blue. I would recommend this car to anyone!!!!!"

I am a 72 year old Senior as are most of my friends.

The Cruiser GT convertible is like driving a convertible SUV with a rocket engine!  I love it!  I was impressed by the build quality, and the performance.  The car is very quiet and has a very well insulated soft top.  With the quirky styling and the Plum color, it gets lots of smiling looks, and compliments in parking lots.  It is just a fun car to drive!  Beyond the fun factor, the car hugs the road and with ABS and traction control is secure in wet and snowy conditions.  You would be hard pressed to find a fun, powerful, distinctive looking convertible that is this well equipped for a better price."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,NaNa, 02/28/2005,Love it!!!,5,"I absolutely LOVE this car and get complimented all the time!  I have mine in Cool Vanilla.  My only complaint is, while there is plenty of leg room in the back, if you have a car seat in, it is hard to fit 2 additional passengers in the back.  Cargo space is excellent, love that the seats fold down.  Considering how expensive gas is, it is pretty fuel efficient.  The pick up is excellent and best of all, this car fits anywhere! "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Ken Nemeth, 02/28/2005,Fun car to drive,4,This is a classy looking car that is fun to drive.  The only drawback so far is the average gas mileage.  You expect a small car like the Cruiser to have really good mileage and it does not.  Still a great car to drive. It is a company car and I am looking forward to taking the trip in it to Florida.  I love it ... wanted one from the day I first saw it.

It has been very useful and enjoyable mainly because it has a large cargo area but doesn't look like a bloody minivan!  It is very stylish inside and out and is comfortable and roomy for us both (we are both tall).  It has been perfectly reliable so far.  I can't believe we payed only $13,880 for this new car when it listed for $17,220.  It's fun to drive and really looks good in Inferno red."

We are both very tall and there is ample head and leg room for both.  The cruiser is very fun to drive.  The car has a lot of style outside.  It has a personality, and is more that just basic transportation. We get an average of 20 mpg in the city.  Acceleration is fairly good for a 4 cl.  So far we are glad we bought the car especially since we paid less that $15,000.00"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,DT, 11/05/2005,Red Hot PT,4,"I have always wanted a PT since they came out, and finally got one. I have the Inferno Red Base PT, and I love the looks. The only issue is the gas mileage. I have a 96 Voyager with the same 2.4 4 cylinder and 3 speed auto, and it gets better mileage in town than the PT. I only have 6k on the PT, so maybe it will improve. My wife wasn't crazy about the PT at first, but she drives it all the time now. I think when we finally get rid of the van, we will go with a ragtop PT. Seating is up high, with a good view of the road. The seats are a bit hard, and get somewhat unconfrontable on long trips, as there is no lumbar adjustments.  Otherwise, this is one Red Hot PT that rocks!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,John King, 11/08/2005,Wife's first new car,4,"The PT replaced my wife's 72 VW.  It is the base model with Auto trans air cond and power windows.  It is extremely roomy front and back. I'm 6'3"" and have more than adequate leg room in the back seat.  My wife is a school teacher and has to haul a lot of supplies which fit easily in back with the seats folded or removed.  Only drawbacks are so so fuel mileage (19 city 24 highway) and it takes two hands to open the tail gate."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Pat, 01/03/2006,Excellent car,4,"Great car.  I don't know where to begin.  I love everything about the car.  It's great for familys, people who travel, New Drivers, pretty much anybody.  Performance of a car, but SUV and Mini van features.  The back seat folds down and comes out.

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,David, 02/03/2006,First time Chrysler owner,4,Great small vehicle. I tested several different makes & models before trying a PT and discovered I had been wasting my time. I wanted something that would not scare you when trying to get onto the freeway or passing someone. This GT will get you there quick and safe. I do like the front of the 2006 model better. I've never had a problem with my car and I drive 80 miles a day round trip to work. My wife loves it so much that we're thinking about selling her Gran Prix GT and getting her a GT-PT also.

The seats in the Limited were much more comfortable, and seat comfort was my ""only"" issue in the rental. I purchased a former rental vehicle and saved oodles off a new car PT price as a result (didn't take a hit on first year depreciation). I took my four (good sized) teenagers for a ride with the spouse and went shopping. Three teens in the back seat rated that back seat a unanimous ""thumbs up"". After grocery shopping and a few other stops, we still had room in the trunk! Even my husband, who is 6'1"" and 245 pounds, found the ride comfortable, especially head room.

The ability to change the rear seating around as needed has really been handy. Also once I put in a K@N air filter in I was able to get as high as 33 mpg on the highway and about 28 city.  Would only recommend the 5 spd due to the lack of power though unless you live somewhere really flat.  If I were going to change something I would have had the power locks and rear truck release as standard equip.  Also the shifting is pretty stiff compared to say a toyota.

no real blind spots. On line I was able 
to see if it was in my price range, and 
figure what my payment should be. I 
actually enjoyed my car buying

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Rhonda Raven, 05/06/2005,MY Car,4,"After putting a lot of money into getting my paid off Buick LeSabre fixed, then having the CHECK ENGINE light come on again, I had had enough. So I went and got me a brand new PT Cruiser with only 22 miles on it! I've always loved the look of these cars and they are even more fun to drive than I could have imagined. It is so roomy and spacious inside even though it may not look like it. The PT Cruiser is listed on uglycars.com which offended me at first, but I don't care.  I absolutely love my plum PT Cruiser!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,blondie77, 09/16/2005,Not A Good Choice,3,"I keep trying to like my PT Cruiser, but it just isn't the right vehicle for me.  The body is too big for the engine, so driving uphill is a real challenge.  Unfortunately, I made a wrong choice and will be trading it in sooner than I had planned."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Donna Ancsanyi, 09/19/2006,05 PT Cruiser Convertible,4,"I got my PT Cruiser convertible in April of 05. I always liked the PT from when it first came out. This car is the cutest car I've ever owned. It drives great, the turbo has great power especially when merging into traffic on the major highways. The a/c works great,all electronics work well. I like how when the top goes down all the windows do too at the same time. I would recommend this car to anyone who likes a convertible. I get alot of compliments on the car all the time. It is a definite head turner. The model I have is the Dream Cruiser Series which makes it alittle different then the usual PT, being that the convertble top color matched that of the car. A great choice in car selection"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Barb Jellison, 04/13/2007,Dream Cruiser is a Dream!,5,"I've had my turbo Dream Cruiser for 2 years. It has never been in for service, except oil changes. Everything has worked perfectly. I am amazed at how solid and quiet the double layer top is when up. With the top down the seats are set deep enough to be safe for my dogs to ride along. We drop the top on warm winter days and turn on the heated seats. It can go up or down at a stop light with a turn of the locking latch and one button push, and the windows go down with it! The stereo with a 6-CD changer is great, and the auto stick is a fun feature. I get more compliments on this car than any I have had before, especially the Lava Red color with matching top. The ""Smart glass"" is amazing too."

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,garcande, 05/25/2013,The PT Cruiser Blues,3,"I recently purchased a beautiful 05 Cruiser Touring Convertible with only 26,000 one owner miles. I bought it from the local Lexus dealer who said it was a trade in. It looks immaculate and garage kept. I had driven about 1000 miles when the electric top riser went out. I took it to my mechanic, he tinkered around with it, but said it wasn't his area of expertise and he was going on vacation. The next day the air conditioner went out. I took it to another mechanic and it was the compressor, of course, and cost $1200 to fix. By contrast, the air on my 96 VW just went at 15K miles! And, I still haven't fixed the top. To be continued...Update to 2015. Car ran fine for a while, ended up selling it. Guy who bought it called me a week or so later and told me the engine died and all the warning lights went on. This Cruiser is a lemon. Maybe some of them were good, but not this one. Oddly enough Fiat is assembling the Fiats that are sold to the US market in the same plant in Toluca, Mexico. I've heard they are riddled with problems, too!

I bought in May and by October it was at the dealer for 7 weeks because the whole instrument cluster was shot to hell.The problems have not stopped since.I have replaced the drive shafts 5 times already.The box is not big enough to list all the problems that I have had.If I did not have friends who are mechanics and had to bring this car to the dealer, I would be near $20,000 in repairs.With one year left in payments near $4,000 I am so tempted to drive this piece of junk thruogh the front window of Chryslers head office."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Ron Pool, 06/16/2009,I Disagree,4,"I have been reading some of the reviews on this vehicle and I am glad to disagree with a lot of the negative comments. I am sorry to read that some have had disappointing experiences but for me, I couldn't ask or more.  Except for having a nis-aligned top, which the dealer quickly corrected, I have been blessed with having a marvelous experience with this little car.  Gas mileage is poor but that's because of the turbo engine.  Which, by the way, really scoots this little gem down the road.  I've had it leased for four years and now I intend to buy it out.  Those who say the warranty is faulty have a bad dealer.  Talk to the regional Chrysler rep.  I like this car!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,garcande, 09/27/2013,More Blues from Chrysler,3,"Well folks, I'm still waiting for the convertible top motor. I had to pay $762.00 back in June before they would order the part and they still can't say when it will come in. It's missed two due dates and now they're saying December, maybe. They can't give me an explanation, either. Other than that the car has been running fine, though I only drive 10 miles a day to and from work.
That's all for now."

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Purrdy Thang, 11/28/2006,Purrdy Thang,5,I love the way my pt handles both in the city and on the highway. On my last road trip my pt got 40 miles to the gal.The ride is very smooth. The inside is more spacious then it appears to be.
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Daelen, 01/05/2007,Fun in the Sun,4,"I have wanted a convertible all my life, and am not a bit sorry I chose this one.  It handles beautifully, has a smooth comfortable ride, the bucket seats cradle you.  The single latch one button operation for the top couldn't be simpler.  This is not a good rainy day car, water will run off the top into open doors or windows due to no gutters on a ragtop, and rain will also run off the lid into the trunk.  The turbo model has good pickup, and there is enough room in the trunk for 2 peoples weekend luggage.  If they could improve the fuel economy even a little it would make this car the best in its class.  Having the Glove Box lock and unlock with the doors would be a really nice feature. "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,texas lady, 05/27/2008,PT Cruiser Convertible,4,The way the trunk lid opens could be improved.  My butt is actually sticking out to the public as I have to bend over to put my things into the trunk. Gas mileage is not as good as one would think with it being a small car with a four cylinder.  I average 19 around town and 22/24 on the highway.   Fun car to drive. I absolutely love my convertible top.  Easy to put down and back up.   
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,TDH, 11/20/2008,Bad Cruiser,2,"The car was fine for the first two years, but it has been a headache ever since. The turbo blew out when the car was 2 years old. It was still under warranty. The dealership performed shoddy work, and it ended up in the shop again for repeat repairs. I would never again purchase a Chrysler. I have spent almost $10,000 in repairs. I hope Chrysler and it subsidiaries go down in flames. No bail out!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Tisa, 07/13/2007,Worst Car I've Ever Owned,3,"The turbo failed completely at 29,000 miles nearly destroying the engine. At 36,035 mi the car began to barely run, jerking on any acceleration, stalling if air conditioner is used, backfiring and putting.  "

As a car I have to say its horrible. 16 MPG average (not city)!! It rumbles when you drive it. I wish i never bought it. You can't take it threw a carwash because of the top. You sit high compared to most cars, witch can be a good or bad thing. The car is slow and i am not exaderating about that, I got passed by a civic and I had it kicked to the floor. This car does not come with ABS atandard or Traction control, there is drumb breaks on the rear tires so when the raod is wet you have no traction and the car slides all over the place"

I have used up my towing allowance with AAA. Chrysler keeps saying theres nothing wrong or they don't know how to fix it, it is a great looking lawn ornament don't be fooled like I was by the great style it is not worth the aggravation and expense. We have all the receipts from the repairs to prove these claims. "

If you live where it doesn't snow, or have another car for winter driving, this is a wonderful ride !
"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Royal Crown, 06/12/2008,Fun PT cruising,4,"This is a plain-vanilla model, no turbo, 2.4L motor with automatic.  In the first 2500 miles, it took 100 gallons of real gas (no alcohol additive, or whatever that is they put in their to supposedly reduce polllution.)  The additive drops it about 10%.  With AC on around town with the additive gas it gets 17-18mpg at 20K miles, 25 or 26 on highway with real gas  gas mileage was disappointing, as the government estimates were 17-25 city and 22-30 highway. Am amazed at those reporting much higher gas mileage.  The ""headrest"" is wrong for me & there was no way to get it out of there to put in a suitable one.  I didn't like black top, but it was all that was offered.  End of complaints."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,White Rhino Chick, 07/09/2008,Absolutely problem free,4,"I have had absolutely no problems with this vehicle.   I just at had to replace the axle shaft but that was the first major thing to go wrong with this vehicle.   It gets 32 mpg and I have changed the oil and rotated the tires every 3,000 miles.   Highly recommend this car if you can't afford something like a Hybrid! "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Frustrated, 11/27/2008,Constant Repairs,3,When we first purchased the PT it seemed like a great vehicle. The gas mileage was always in the high 20's. Had maintanence preformed at the scheduled time and thought we were taking good care of it. Once the problems started the milage suffered and is around 22. At 28000 had the headgasket replace to take care of an oil leak at 48000 replaced the right and left lower control arms and bushings at 56000 the battery shorted out leaving the vehicle total dead at 58000 replaced spark plugs and wires and now the transmission seems to be having problems. Most of the miles are from the 60 mile round trip to work on the open highway. Never owned a vehicle with so many problems with this low of milage
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,theccur, 01/15/2009,Pocket Rocket,4,"With 225hp and select shift, this car can be a hoot to drive. In town it has excellent flingability. On winding roads the brakes could be more powerful and the handling less flexible.  Unfortunatly, I paid a premium price for a car that, aside from the drive train, only has a few extras (and leather) over the base model. No, I wouldn't buy it again, but on the whole its been a good deal thanks to the premium extended warranty.  Despite low mileage, the turbo eats CV joints and there have been other early, more minor, mechanical failures.  Gas mileage, highway and city, is unacceptably poor. Think SUV, which it definitely is not. "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Kyoti, 08/12/2009,My 2005 PT Cruiser Touring Edition,4,"I bought this car new in 2005. Decided to wait on a review until it was a few years old. I like to test something out for quite awhile before giving a review. It has low miles because I mainly use it as my work/commuter car. But it is a pretty reliable car. Haven't had too much problems with it. My oil relay went out and my CD player went out as well. That's the only problems I've has with it in the 4 years I've had it. It doesn't get as good of gas mileage as I would have thought...it gets the same as my old 1998 Mustang V6 and I think that's pretty bad actually, it should get better than that. All-in-all good car. "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Kris, 09/09/2009,Very bad car,3,"This car has the worst turn radius! It also has lots of problems with the engine. My blew at 70,000 miles and Chrysler won't fix it.

So far I absolutely love the car.  The only downside to driving it I have found so far is when you start it, it sounds like a common, weak 4-banger that will make your right leg sore to drive it.  Of course then you put it in drive, barely touch the throttle and it takes off like a rocket, all while the motor sounds like its barely even trying.  While driving down the road, just imagine you have a very powerful v6 engine under the hood, and you will never know the difference.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone. "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Arlisha Anderson, 07/19/2010,PT LOSER,3,I bought my PT Cruiser from Nissan Woodland Hills.  It worked great for the first 4 years but now it keeps overheating!  I now call it the pt loser or pity cruiser. Just don't buy one! 
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,SandiH, 12/03/2004,Not as good as the original,4,"I had a 2001 PT wagon, which I absolutely loved!  Traded it in for the convertible, and was very disappointed.  New turbo engine was great, but I found I really missed the cargo room of the original.  Even taking convertible into account, the trunk is VERY poorly designed and hard to access -- even for weekly chores like groceries.  Also found the seatbelt uncomfortable -- hit me on the neck, and isn't adjustable.  I'm 5'5'', and felt as if the driver's seat had to be pushed way forward to reach the clutch.  Sad to say, after just 6 months I traded it in (at a loss of $9,000 in just 6 mos!  So much for holding its value!) for a Lexus RX330.  "

I'm not going to say this is close to a Porsche, but it is a lot of fun and a real head turner, guys and gals, and it gets lots of looks and questions. We've driven it on two trips, 1500 miles and 2800 miles..great trip car, very comfortable, GREAT performance from the turbo engine, very comfortable with top down. At Interstate speeds, we can converse at normal voice levels, and hear the radio/cd player, which, by the way,is easy to use and has good sound quality. "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Scott In Buffalo, 12/16/2004,From Honda to Chrysler,4,"When I traded my 02 Accord SE for this vehcile, I was very apprehensive about my first ""American"" car in over 10 years.  Overall, I have had the cruiser for about a month and am satisfied  with my buying decision.  It seems at this point the imports are not willing to deal.  I was even told by a local Honda dealer ""We don't really negotiate on our Accords anymore, they sell themselves"".  Well, not to this consumer.  The cruiser is an excellent vehicle on a long trip.  Everyone is comfortable, including rear seat passengers.  It takes a while for gas mileage to improve but I am finally getting about 22 MPG in a city/hwy mix after about 4 weeks."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,D. Johnson, 01/09/2005,PT GT,4,"I needed a car that was practical, and when I drove the PT GT I found a practical car I actually liked driving.  In good or bad weather, the PT handles well, and has been a pleasure to own and drive.  "

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,W. Robb, 02/10/2005,A Grown Womans Opinion,4,"I love my red PT Cruiser.  My husband & I own a bar & it suits both my business & personal needs.  The ability to reconfigure the rear area from passenger seating, to dog transporter, to cargo areas make it PERFECT for me.  I can afford most any auto made, but choose my PT Cruiser because it's cute AND practical.  It's nice to drive a car that does not look generic."

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Rob Man, 02/17/2005,Niche vehicle,4,"Okay, it's not for everybody. As a ""mini-mini-van"", it has no peer. Get the 5-speed and enjoy a modicum of performance (and the joy of rowing). As for utility, it's HUGE inside. With the limited edition, you get all of the creature comforts plus a fairly good handling vehicle. It's noisy above 60 and the chassis gives away it's truck heritage. Also, the trade value drops by half in only two years. Still - I'd buy another in a heartbeat! I often coose it over my Japanese luxury-performance car and my bread-and- butter Japanese economy car for sheer fun. I repaet that it's not for everybody, but if you're looking for a vehicle with certain special qualities, the PT Cruiser may just be it!"

When on the hwy. and a semi-truck passes by, I do not get 'blown' away.   I am a tall person, and there is exceptional amount of room in the front, and comfortable amount in the rear seating area.    It's a fun car to drive, and the turbo engine delivers when you need it.   "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,BethThor, 02/28/2005,love it,4,The only complaint is some minor whirring and whislte from the engine at times.  Probably the turbo pressuring up and relieving pressure when coming down.  Yee Hah!
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,pwpaar, 03/02/2005,PT Cruiser - Happy in Akron,4,"My 2005 PT is the third one I've purchased.  I've liked all of them. They are easy to maintain and are reliable.  The only problems I've encountered are tire/wheel related.  As the chrome deteriorates, the beading on tires allow air to leak out.  The local Goodyear dealer burnishes the rims and that usually solves it. It's very easy to change oil and filters on PTs."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Cuzbear, 03/02/2005,Cruiser Happy,4,From the very first moment I saw the PT Cruiser I knew it was the car for me. It is the most perfect vehicle for my needs. I didn't expect to have people wave at me just because I was driving the car of the year at the time.  The design is also very useful and handy.  I carry all kinds of stuff in comfort and ease.  PT is reliable and has never let me down.
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Paul, 03/27/2005,PT Turbo Ragtop - Exactly what I Wanted,4,"When I first drove a PT Cruiser I wasn't sure what to expect. It looked smaller than I expected but drove larger than anticipated. The only disappointment was with the 2.4 liter 4 cylinder; it seemed to be underdesigned and my mind was changed...I decided that I would not buy an anemic retro- style vehicle.   Then I saw the articles in the press about the (then) upcoming Turbocharged convertible and thought that it was worth another try.  I preselected the most challenging road in Akron, Ohio near the dealership and took two test drives; one in a 2.4 cylinder and the other in the 2.4T.  Finally I had found the car I thought I wanted from the start.  Thanks Daimler-Chrylser, you made it!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Pasquale Capocci, 03/29/2005,I Love My PT Convertible,4,"For the price it is a really nice car. It is very roomy and comfortable for a convertible. I drove it all winter and it is very quit with the top up, you forget you are driving a convertible."

After purchasing I have experienced nothing more but pure enjoyment with comfort, ride and  dependability. I cannot stop loving the Classic look of the PT Cruiser and I still enjoy the looks I get from other people while sporting my car. I purchased the top of the line the PT Cruiser Limited Edition in Cranbury, with top of line ""wheels"" as well, and I have received many, many compliments about what a ""nice"" car it is!! I'm very happy although I must say.... I enjoy putting the kids in the back seat with the tinted windows and no one can see in. I enjoy people asking me about my PT Cruiser. My mother loves my PT Cruiser!!!!!!!!!!!"

Solid feel to vehicle and no rattles or squeaks, top fits tight with no air noise and roll bar keeps cabin quiet with top down. An excellent buy, for a distinctive car that doesn't look like everything else on the road. "

This one is frisky and fun to drive.  The turning radius is very wide but this is the only negative that we have found.  It is very comfortable and the back seat is roomy and the most comfortable of any other convertible that we have owned. It is also very quiet. We have our first GPS in this one.  It gets us where we want to go.  In fact, we won't buy another car without one.  "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Nick, 04/14/2005,PT cruiser fun to drive,5,This car is just plain fun to drive. With the 220 HP turbo it will get and go. If you like sporty cars this is the one for you.

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Quincey, 04/16/2005,Fun Car-Poor Mileage,3,Heads turn with the top down. Fun car to drive. Car was great in snow. Poor gas mileage is the only negative thing we found. Almost have the car a year now.Tunk opening a little awkward.
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Gary, 04/17/2005,PT Convertible - Fun and Affordable,4,"This is a fantastic vehicle for the money.  It is fun to drive, always getting looks from people and the worst thing that's been said about it from people looking/admiring is - ""How Cute"" The mileage has been very acceptable, the Sport Bar does cut down the wind noise on the road with the top down so you can hold a conversation and not a shouting match. The boot is not difficult tp put on and take off - when done correctly - it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure it out. And in the 10 months we've owned it the top has been up MAY 5 times. I mean come on, why have a convertible if you don't put the top down."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,JB3, 04/16/2005,I love my car!,4,"I've owned my cruier convertible now for a year, and have very little negative to say about it.  I have the GT Turbo model, so needless to say, the performance is excellent. The handling is very smooth on the road, and the easiest car I have ever driven. The car is roomy, comfortable, stylish and still turns heads after a year.  Four fit comfortably in the car, and there is ample leg room for everyone, front or back.  The trunk is also roomier than I thought it would be.  This is a well put together and thought out vehicle."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Kathy Furnas, 04/17/2005,I love my car.,5,"I love my PT Convertible.  I have had it a year now and for the first time am not ready to trade it off.  Such fun to drive, especially with the top town.  Comfortable, fun and sexy.  Can't beat that!!!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,pallidun, 04/28/2005,New PT convertible,5,"Had an orginal PT, this one is so much better in every respect, design, engine performance handling etc."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Tina , 04/29/2005,I love this car!!!,4,"I  bought this car about 2-3 weeks after it came out on the showroom floor. It handles very well and the top is quite easy to operate, especially when getting caught in the rain!  The only complaint I have is the trunk. When you're putting something in it, you have to bend under, and I've hit my head more than once, but the pros far outweigh the cons in my opinion!!! "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Robyn Hurd, 04/30/2005,Makes the Drive NOT Boring,4,This car is exceptionally fun to drive. I like to drive with the top down (Florida) nearly all of the time and the ease of putting it up and down (One button) allows this. You can easily go Up or Down at a Stop sig! Plenty of Power. Amazing interior room. And Cute as it can be!
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Gerald Harry, 05/01/2005,midlife crisis,4,"We love the look and preformance of our Convertable PT,it is fun to drive top up or down........."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,John1096, 05/12/2005,Time Will Tell,4,"This vehicle is basically for my wife..she liked the ""look"". What I have found is that the PT cruiser makes good use of interior space, is comfortable and fun to drive. I am not sure if the ""Fun"" factor will remain as time goes on..that is small problems, parts gets loose , rattles performance drops etc...Only Time Will Tell!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Judybl, 05/17/2005,A pleasant surprise,4,"Needed a fun car to tow behind our Freightliner(Chrysler) motorhome. Always looked down on the PT Cruiser, but tried the convertible and have been in love with it ever since.  Standard transmission makes the power of the small engine very adequate- As a pleasant surprise- there is virtually no road noise with the top up, and very acceptable noise with it down. Lowest price model had all the accessories we think are mandatory (remote entry, power windows, and even compass and temperature)  Chrysler build quality on this car built in Mexico is impeccable- even better than the Lexus RX300 we traded for it.  Would we buy it again- yes."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Michele, 05/27/2005,PT,4,"Great vehicle in a small package.  Easy to enter and exit (even with a bad knee). Great acceleration, this car makes us smile."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,The YARDI Guy, 05/27/2005,"So far, so good...",4,"I just bought it, after a few thousand miles in Chrysler Sebrings.  The Sebring is great on the highway, but a little ""boaty"" in the city, not to mention too AARP for me.  The PT, on the other hand, is just ""ugly enough"" to keep things on the light side.  Plus, it's nimble enough and small enough to zip around the burbs.  50 is as fast as I can do in the 300 mile break-in, so I hope it does as well over 70.  For that matter, I hope I do, too!!!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,lee bolding, 05/27/2005,Cruisin in style,4,"Have only had good experiences with this auto .. Very solid heavy feel - holds the road well, good acceleration."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Lang, 05/27/2005,The Lang account,4,I love to drive it around every where.  Every where I go I get comments about how good it looks.  It drives smooth and has awesome pick-up.It's a great little car with plenty of space in the back seat.
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Barnum, 05/28/2005,Not bad so far...,4,"Veh has great functionality, very comfortable for four adults. 4 cyl w/auto is spunky. Most always can be configurable for whatever I need to carry. However, even when I really try I can't get better than 20 mpg city, and have never gotten over 22 on the highway. That's pitiful for a 4 cyl engine. RAV-4 will probebly be next car-  too bad, because I really like driving the Cruiser..."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,AIMNICHOLE, 05/28/2005,Love it!,5,"This car has been amazing!  I have so much fun in it!  Also with the glass back window, and the airtight top, you cant even tell it is a convertible with the top up, it is awesome!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Rick, 05/28/2005,Gt Cruiser is a HIT & Mighty FAST,4,"There isn't a car made that has as many after market add ons available. Adding to an already supurb automobile. Chrysler did this one right. The turbo has no lag and has a wonderful spooling up sound, handles as well as any sports car I have ever driven. I am totally in love with the performance and handling of this vehicle. 15 in tires on chrome rims add to the road handling manners as well as the 4 speed auto tranny with the shift matic function. Truly awsome and made with attention to detail unrivaled by other US manufacturers. Two thumbs way-way up for the GT Cruiser. I'd buy another in a New York Second."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Robert Thompson, 05/28/2005,Great enjoyment,4,"We fell in love with it in car magazine pictures. Full blown love when we actually saw one on the lot. Took it home to try and it has not left. Great fun, great ease to enjoy the top down. Great purformance and gas mileage balance. The turbo is wonderful. Only down side has been having to replace the front brakes after only 18K miles of normal city driving. We simply love the little thing that is not so little and really works for us. Drives great, looks great and we get great comments on it every where we go. Thanks Chrysler for contintinueing to put out exciting cars. I just wish I could have a HEMI in it."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Jo, 05/28/2005,Love my cruiser,4,"It's hard to believe I am taking time to answer your inquiry but I love my car so much that it is worth the time.....Driving with the top down and the roll bar in view makes me feel l6 again...when I park it even if next to an expensive car, my little beauty gets the looks....I have owned Mercedes through Corvettes, and this is my number l favorite.  Only downfall is trunk space, but small price to pay for driving this American Beauty....  Jo Zarnoch, Director of Real Estate, River Run Country Club."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,CINDY, 05/29/2005,New owner sothern california,4,I just purchased the pt turbbo conv cruiser .....Fun to drive good looking sports car feel . Has a nice punch with the turbo ..Only two complaints i have are the lack of ability to get into the trunk without bending down really low ...And the seats are a tad bit shallow in the front could be about 3 inches more in length other than that its a cool car and we love it !
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,jqd100, 05/29/2005,Fun Car with Real People Appeal,4,"We have a fully optioned GT with inferno red exterior, tan interior and tan top. We decided on PT because wife liked comfort of high seating positon. This car attracts more attention than any car I have owned. We didn't buy it for that reason, but has turned out that way. Kids to the elderly are fascinated by it. I am amazed how people will go out of their way to talk to us about the car. Nearly all conversations end with them saying: ""I bet you have fun in that car"" We do! We live in central Florida and the top is nearly always down. The car has given us no problems, initial quality was good. We have had a good dealership experience. Of course, it is a small town dealer we know."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Keith and Aileen, 06/01/2005,Great little retro,4,I have had zero problems with this car. It is my second PT and both (the other was a sedan) have been outstanding in every way. I've had 60+ cars and these two have been two of the best. 
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Wm Mangano, 06/10/2005,Fun PT Cruiser Convertible,4,"No doubt about it,  this car not only performs well it looks good doing it.  I have owned many new cars,  and by far this is the most fun to drive."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Denis Cich, 06/10/2005,PT Crusier,4,"This is a great car to drive. we have the Turbo engine in a Touring model and this thing has plenty og get up and go. It seems that the gas mileage could be better since it only has the 4 cylinder. I haven't had any service problems, but only have 15,000 miles on it so far. Plenty of room in the front compartment for the size of the car and it's fairly comfortable."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,PMARMORATO, 06/10/2005,2005 Ptconvt,4,I think this is a great second car fun to drive good running has some get-up and go and nice to look at i get alot of thumbs up with this
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,The YARDI Guy, 06/10/2005,A realistic rating,4,"My first review wasn't posted, so here's a more informed and probably more realistic review than my first.  This car is a street-legal version of the bumper car you find on the carnival midway.  That said, I like it very much - too much to subject it to a supermarket parking lot or a recently oiled and sanded road.  But, honestly, a four-banger automatic is not a ""10"" in performance.  And 20/26 MPG is mediocre at best.  It IS tops for fun, especially the ""hey, look at me - I bet you wish you were driving under the sun in this than ""couped-up"" (that's a pun, not a misspell) in that Lexus"" smile I wear when I'm behind the wheel.  I even like stoplights so I can give them all a good look-see!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Cindy, 06/12/2005,I love my cruiser!,5,"Very roomy and adaptable with fold down seats; can fit quite a bit in the back! lots of interior extras; love the moon roof! It's so comfortable, smooth ride, turbo engine gives it lots of power,spirit and whoooosh! The most fun car I've ever driven! I'd thought of getting a VW but once test driving the PT w/Turbo I was sold! It's so cute too! Mine is Inferno red..My ""Wild Cherry Mobile""! "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Larry Harris, 06/27/2005,Love our PT convertible,4,We get more compliments from people than I can believe. Every where we go folks tell us that the wife's car is very sharp.The performance is unbelievable with the turbo and the 4 wheel disc brakes stop the car very quickly with little fade. The power top is a breeze to raise and lower also.
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,jtdev, 06/28/2005,It has it where it needs it - TURBO,4,"Love the little car. So much HP and speed. Seats are too firm and center console could have been designed better, but overall, fantastic little car. "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Cindy, 07/07/2005,The best,5,The convertible PT cruiser is the best car to drive. It is a lot of fun and highly economical as well. 
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,NeverPT, 07/08/2005,bad...,2,"bought it brand new but already had a couple of problems after owning it for less than 3 weeks. chirping noise due to misalignment of belt. air conditioning doesn't work well. Brought it to dealer today to have belt replaced and have AC checked. car seats are not comfortable. gas mileage is OK. the first tank got 24.2 mpg, not bad. "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Larry E Nave, 07/23/2005,Great Small Wagon,4,"I just purchased my PT Cruiser, I traded in a 2003 Durango for it. I liked my Durango, but wanted something easier on gas. The Cruiser fits the bill, fun to drive, for a 4 cyclinder it has great get up an go. My Son has a 2004 Touring and my nephew justed traded his 2002 for a new Touring also, they love them. I have always be a Chrysler person, have had Dodge, Plymouth and Chryslers."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,DEXTER, 07/23/2005,Doesn't get any better than this one,5,"I had a 2001 pt,  traded it in for this little power house.  The performance is outstanding.  The braking very precise.  The convertible top is the easiest to put down, everything with one hand.  Thanks for making this vehicle chrysler!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Michael Smith, 07/26/2005,I should have had one of these all along,4,"I have a 2005 base, 5 speed, convertible. I can't believe how much attention I get with it. Everyone wants to go for a ride. People thank it's a $30,000.00 car and when I tell them that I paid around $18,000.00 for it they ask me if I got it used. nope! The 5 speed is fun and shifts so smoothe. It could use a little more power but with this car you just want to kick back and take it easy anyway.. It rides and handles great. I expected alot of noise with a conv. but I was so supprised at how quiet it is. The way you sit and the way everything is layed out makes me feel like the car was made for me. Alot of thinking went into it. the only thing I would trade it for is the gtversion"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Gloria, 09/13/2005,Poor gas mileage and VERY poor in frontal,2,We had alot of problems with the starter switch and in a frontal crash the engine came up into the firewall which caused alot of personal injuries to driver and passanger.  We did not get good mileage in city driving.
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,amerigo88, 10/20/2005,Classy Silver Convertible with verve,4,"Driving this convertible for 3 weeks now.  Took 1,000 mile trip second week.  MPG fluctuates a lot, but looks like will be close to 22 city/29 hwy. I've seen 21 low and 40(!)high so far. Top is almost always down and a/c off. Only hiccup was fuel gauge dropped to dead empty for about 15 minutes, but no problems since. Trunk setup is surprisingly roomy and stooping is not as bad as I expected. My girls act like the back seat is in a roller coaster-fun.  Turning circle a bit wide. Haggled dealer into AM/FM/CD/MP3 player to replace AM/FM/Cassette due to some bait and switch resentment. Glad I did.  Base audio sounds rather muddy, though. 70 mph with top down and windows up is fine on freeway."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Ed Morrison, 10/24/2005,It' Fun and Practical,5,We are a 2 PT family!  Love the styling and the turbo makes all the difference in the world in performance.  It's fun and practical for a convertible.   We love our 2003 sedan and the 2005 convertible with the turbo is a great addition to the rolling stock.  
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,KEN KNOWLES, 10/28/2005,Not enough gears/ room,4,Needs to have more gears 4 isn't a enough.  Rpms go way too high at higher speeds.
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,rick, 11/09/2005,fun car,5,"i would sum this car up in one word- great. the car handles good, drives good, gets good gas mileage etc. we live in a mountain region and so far we are very pleased with this car."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Gregg, 01/02/2006,My Favorite Car Ever!,4,"This is my 2nd Cruiser. Leased an '02 Limited for 3 1/2 yrs and liked it so much I bought this one. I had no trouble at all with the first one for over 23,000 miles and not with this one after 2000 miles. Even after after 4 yrs I still like to look at it, and smile whenever I see another one. The 180 HP turbo has great pickup, a big improvement over the base engine. I also love the look and functionality of the interior (glad I got the '05-I don't like the int/ext changes on the '06). I can't imagine driving another car-I hope this one lasts forever!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,4CatMom, 01/07/2006,We love this car!,4,"My husband and I (ages 31 and 28 respectively) bought this as our ""family"" car once we start our family. We actually hated the look of it when it first came out but during our honeymoon in 2004 our rental car turned out to be a PT Cruiser and we fell in love with it. It is so roomy inside it surprises you! I've been driving it exclusively for a few weeks now and can't imaging driving anything else! I have filled up the back with groceries as well as other items. The folding back seats are great for long or oversize cargo. "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,kc from washington, 01/22/2006,The best safety rating,4,"I got one of the last 2005 PT's in the area.  I didn't intend on buying the Limited Edition but glad I did.  My insurance gave it the best safety rating they offer.  Costs me less than my Suzuki Vitara (worth half the value).  I love the way it handles; drives very sporty.  I live in the country and it handles great on the many curves and inclines.  Wish the gas mileage was better, but it's worth it."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,madis saarniit, 01/23/2006,Driving in Style,4,"Every time I drive my turbo PT Crusier ragtop I turn heads. From the ease of getting into the car to the decievingly large amount of room inside, comfort seems to be the key. It has a great sound system and is a very smooth drive. The only drawback I can see is limited visability when backing up while the top is up.  "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,T, 01/25/2006,PT Cruiser 2205 touring,4,"Been very reliable,just oil changes,handles well and has enough power for everyday driving, could do a little better on fuel economy.A great little car"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,D.G.J., 02/04/2006,Our newest PT Cruiser,4,"This is our family's fourth PT Cruiser, a black '05 Limited with the ""woody"" treatment.  We still have two PT Cruisers, an '04 plum (the wife's) and an '03 patriot blue standard shift (belonging to my business) - both of them basic models.  We love this car, not only for its classic ""retro"" look, but because it is extremely comfortable to drive and functional.  All are a joy to drive.  We took our '05 on an 8,600 trip around the country in July-August 2005 with absolutely no problems (in fact, no problems in the total of 19,000 miles now on the odometer).  I just hope the are still making the PT Cruiser when it's time to trade in the '03 - but that won't be for a while."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,mare, 02/25/2006,I love my Baby !!,4,This car is so much fun to drive!! I always get stopped by people to ask about it. It handles the road very well. I live in the north east and was going to take it off the road for the winter but did not want to give it up. I have been very impressed on the way it handles in the ice and snow
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Robert Shaw, 02/28/2006,It's a fun car,5,"Thoroughly enjoy driving this car around town.   Have received many, many compl- ments about from complete strangers.  Still received them and car is almost two years old!!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Fun seeker, 03/27/2006,Affordable fun,4,Lots of fun! affordable!  I bought mine used-20k for 15k.  I thought it was most fun I can buy for the price.  love neo-classic desgin. My first convertible-I always wanted one. Love sitting position as it is higher than most passenger cars.  Interior size is perfect-as big as some midsize cars.  Back seats are great-You can actually sit in them! Interior design good. Stereo is not very good but it serves its purpose.  Car drives ok-not as smooth as other compact cars I have driven.  Turbo is fun!  Exterior size is compact so easy to control execpt for the blind spots with top up.  Insurance cost is very high-about 35% more than my 2001 Altima. Gas mileage- low 20's city/hwy combined
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,mackama, 04/07/2006,Room for a big guy,4,"My wife has always liked the PT, and when it was time to replace her Ford ZX2, went went looking for a four door to make it easier for our grandchild.  After driving the PT, we were sold.  They did just about everything right.  Its only drawback is the fuel ecomomy. We went from over 30 mpg with the ZX2 to under 26 with the PT."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,V eronical, 03/07/2004,Turbo is the only way to go,4,"Looks and is smaller then regular PT. 
Handles nicely on accelaration because 
of turbo. Regular gas saves at pump a 
bit. Younger feel to it. Deck space 
really small, but compensation is the 
freedom of the convertiable. Top easy 
to open and close. Safety bar looks 
cool. Ride is definetily a sports car. 
Front wheel drive only maybe not for 
all.
Seems air tight when closed up while 
driving. "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,marymary, 04/25/2006,Survived a Deer!,4,"I love this car like I have no other! Fun to drive with the top down and turbo roaring. This week a deer ran in front of me while I ws driving about 35mph. The impact didn't feel bad, felt like someone threw a basketball at the car. The deer was unfortunately killed. When I assessed the damage I was surprised how extensive it was. Bent hood and radiater, dented left fender, bent both grills...about $4K in all. I am so impressed at how little impact that I felt (airbags did not deploy.) The 2006 safety rating just came out and were excellent for PT's. The survivability of an accident in this car vs. a larger vehicle had always gnawed at me a bit...now I feel better."

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,PJ, 05/23/2006,Wonderful,4,"I have only had this car for a couple of days, but I love it! I have owned a Jetta for 6 years and this is WAY better. I love the ride, the interior and everything about it. It gets the same gas mileage as my Jetta which was 30 miles fwy. You can't go wrong. I do see some of the things people in their other reviews had said, but they aren't annoying after you drive a Jetta. "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Dyna, 05/31/2006,Great car fun fun to drive,5,I love my pt  gt convert. it is the most fun car I have ever had.

is such a hot car.  I have had this 
car for less then 2 days and already 
have had 10 people tell me how much 
they love the styling.  I have the 
Electric Blue with Dark interior.  It 
is so hot! This car isn't the GT, but 
it has so much power.  I wish the 
tires where higher performance with 
better grip because I have smoked the 
tires four times from start to 40 and 
once while going 20 and hitting the 
gas."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Susan Skinner, 06/03/2006,Tons of Fun!,4,"Traded in my 94 4 Runner for a 2005 PT Cruiser GT Turbo in Cool Vanilla with a khaki top. WOW! I Love it! It is solid, fun to drive - makes me wake up hoping each day is nice enough to put the top down! This model has a lot of power so it takes some getting used to in pulling out from a stop-one day I over- corrected. Not used to all that pep. Any complaints I have are minor. Its hard to grab the seatbelts from behind the seats, there are visibility issues - but overall I couldnt be happier with this cool car!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Paul from Pomona, 03/23/2004,Just got one,4,"Great speed and acceleration, with 
great handeling. Tight with an 
unexpected quiet. The most fun I've had 
driving in a long while. Great back 
seat, with comfort and not too much 
wind/noise. It feels like a big sports 
car. The best of both - sports and 
sedan. Fun watching the heads turn.  "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,texag, 03/23/2004,New Cruiser,4,"Just bought my new Touring convertable 
last weekend.  Drove down country roads 
near my home, and was very pleasantly 
surprised how smooth the ride was.  
This is the most fun to drive car I 
have ever owned."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,JR Ero, 03/26/2004,Satisfying Experience,4,"The Convertible PT's main strength is 
its flashy looks and its distinctive 
interior/exterior design. Fun to drive 
with the turbo spririted acceleration 
and smoothness. The layout of the dash 
and its stylish body give the car 
character. The backseat are roomy 
enough to accommodate two adults in 
comfort. Top is easy to open and close. 
Safety bar looks very cool. The PT is 
definitely worth the price."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,CalvinX, 06/17/2006,PT Cruiser Convertible,5,"I purchased this car when I turned 40.  I actually researched and purchased this car ""online"" before they were available to the public.  Two years later I am still very pleased with my purchase.  For the price, it was a very good purchase."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,MICHAEL YANKO, 07/09/2006,GO TURBO or stay on the porch!,4,"I'm in love with my car again!!!!  I'm a convertible man for the last 30 years and I must say I'm very impressed with this awesome vehicle.  I have a bad lower back and the way these seats fit me is like they were designed by my chiropractor....the height fully raised is perfect...the lumbar is firm, and because of the roof height there is no lower back strain on me getting in and out.  When I test drove a new Touring Turbo ragtop I and took it on a drivers ed obstacle course, then to a vacant parking lot to find out what it would really do....I smoked the tires, tried to roll it, ..and although I didn't buy the new one I tested...I decided the PT Cruiser Turbo covertible was the one for me!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,wilky, 04/08/2004,I love it,4,"I picked up my PT cruiser convertible 
over a week ago and love it. The ride 
is smooth and quiet. I was surprised 
even when the top is down how quiet and 
great the car drives. The weather has 
been only in the 50's and still have 
loved driving the car with the top 
down, I can't wait until the summer. I 
think the turbo option is a must for a 
little more pep!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Pammy, 07/20/2006,Just Crusin',4,I think this is the greatest car!  Not only does it handle well but it gets a lot of attention while driving.  Nice pick up... love driving on the open road.  
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,Martyh1957, 04/14/2004,Reliving my 20's,4,"This convertible is great!  I love 
being on of the first to own it.  The 
engine is very peppy, the sound system 
is wonderful and I love the rag top.  
If it would only warm up a bit and 
stop raining!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2005,alyne, 04/18/2004,PT Touring Convertible,4,"Purchased April 6 2004.   This car has 
a blind spot the size of an elephant, 
use of the side mirrors may help to 
correct this.  I love the intuitive 
and ergonomically well-placed control 
buttons on the dash.  Lots of head and 
leg room  front and rear.  The colour 
matched sport bar looks great.  The 
cute little trunk is a tad awkward to 
access. The 2.4L Standard Turbo, using 
regular gas, provides plenty of power 
for city and highway driving.  
Assembled in Toluca, Mexico. .  I love 
it!  "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,opcfan, 07/17/2014,The small red pt,3,"I got this car used in a very good shape with a manual. After a new clutch and a full tune-up i drove this car from Nyc to Miami and back. The car was extremely comfortable, able to cruise at 90-100mph with no drama, good handling and 30mpg. Driving in stop and go traffic and getting 20 mpg is not fun but hear compliments from old people. The car never had a mechanical issue."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,sim40son, 12/24/2011,Wish I knew how expensive it would be to repair,2,"I have had this car since 2007, it was fine for the 1st year but I had to put brakes on a fairly new car.
Have to buy new tires all the time it wears them out, new brakes every year because of the ceramic brake pads bad design.
wiring harness went and something else that was not suppose to ever go bad, chrysler paid for that.
I have had to put new wheel bearings on, when the timing belt brakes it takes out the whole housing expensive, even a tune up is outrageous.
I am reviewing cars this time.
I like my PT cruiser, but I do not like the huge expense of repairs, chrysler parts are expensive.
My mechanic told me that chylsers are very expensive to repair.
wish I new ahead of time."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,mikeru669, 09/05/2012,Reliable car over the long haul,4,"We purchased our 2006 Cruiser with 13K miles on it 66 months ago, we now have 115K miles, we traveled all over the country on all kinds of roads. The Cruiser has been one of the most reliable cars we have owned. Only recurring problem, camshaft positioning sensor replaced twice since car went over 80K. Takes about 15 minutes to replace. Had a Neon prior which the Cruiser is based on. The Neon was one of the 2 or 3 worse cars we ever owned."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Susan E. Craig-Gilson, 04/03/2015,Great Looking Car - Lots of Issues!,3,"Bought in 2009 with 43K miles. Within 3 years had to replace the entire back end of car - sometimes certain pieces TWICE! Get only 18 to 19 mpg in the city; maximum I've seen is only 23 mpg and that was only once. Now it seems like I have to replace things in the front. This car is not driven like a maniac; I drive it very safely. Bad vision out of the right window; you can't see cars on the right side. Costs about $50.00 to fill a tank - every week. Fits a lot of stuff inside and is extremely attractive but very expensive on mechanical problems and for gas.  Fabric seats are starting to rip (no, I have no pets or children in the car)"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,John Wilde, 12/27/2015,Old faithful,5,"Bought new, now has 87000 miles. One of top 5 of over 85 cars I have owned. Reminds me of my  Renault 16, with all of its virtues and few of the annoyances. Great road car. We actually preferred it to the Volvo V70 T5 and Buick Lesabre we owned. Quiet, comfortable, great cargo space. Reliable: only timing belt, water pump and brakes replaced at 75,000 miles. My wife and I can't understand why some people hate this car. Still going strong
"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,dgs49, 01/22/2013,Cool & Fun Wagon,4,"This GT wagon rides and handles exceptionally well, and accelerates briskly once you get the turbo to wake up.
The riding position is surprisingly high, but I got used to it fairly quickly. I posted this because I didn't see anone else with the turbo and a stick.
My mpg is a lot better than I've read here (22-23 combined) on 89 octane.
With these cars out of production, the resale value is sinking rapidly, which is a good thing for possible buyers.
Mine had 56k miles when I got it and it is very tight and rattle-free."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,PAC for PTC, 10/22/2006,PTC Owner for Life!!!,4,"I love almost all aspects of my PT. My only negative is gas mileage and I miss gas tank on drivers side. I drive mostly city but feel the gas issue could be greatly improved on. As for the window controls, they aren't clunky, it just takes time to get used to reaching for the middle dash. Handles like a dream, great on quick maneuvering. Drove a mini-van for 20 years and am pleased with the cargo versatility. Visibility is really nice as seating is higher than in a comparable small vehicle, Seat height makes it very easy to get in and out of. Love the fun styling. I'd miss the towel bar as I have it decorated!!! Very easy to hand wash. Next goal: Limited Edition - Loaded - Can't wait!!"

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Ed M, 05/21/2010,Love my GT PT convert,4,"Bought the GT PT Convert in April 2010, it is a 2006 and the owner was a senior, car had only 7,900 miles on it!  So far just needed a new driver's door mirror- it broke and dealership covered it.  Gas is definitely an issue, but if you want the extra horse you gotta pay.  This car is flawless for five years old.  Only use it three or four times a week, plan to keep garaged and immaculate.  Hope to preserve as a collector item.  Chrysler only made the GT Conv for two years 05 and 06.  Have orig build sheet and window sticker- love this car and plan to keep into it's antique years."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Tink, 08/06/2006,Just plain fun and an eye catcher,4,"I LOVE my PT cruiser convertible.  At first it wasn't what I wanted, but top on my list was to get a convertible and this one was the most affordable.  It is purple and believe me I get lots of comments.  The interior is spacious, it's easy to get into, the trunk is not bad, not huge but sufficient, gas mileage is acceptable.  My biggest complaint on this model is the lever that pulls the front seat foward, my 9 yr old has a rough time with it and sometimes so do I.  Overall this is a terrific car!  Its not as sleek and sexy as other convertibles, what it lacks in 'looks' it makes up for in personality!  "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Jo, 10/08/2006,Please - where did you all get your PT?,3,"I have had nothing but disappointment with my PT. Yes, it is cute and sporty, but the last 4 tanks of gas have gotten me 17.4, 17.3 16.4 and 16.4 miles to the gallon! I have called,  had the car looked at with Chrysler giving me excuses about the engine is new, it needs to be broken in, you are not driving it right, you have to change how you drive...It is a 4-cyl car, I repeat 4-cyl car, and should be getting better mileage. I drive 50% city and 50 % highway.  My parents 8 cyl Jaguar getting better mileage...  The car is simply average but sells on emotion, sentimentality and looks. My only regret is that I may be waiting 1 year to trade it in for a better performing and economical car."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,ptcrusier, 04/06/2013,Used As A Designer Car,4,"&#65279;The second owner which we were looking for a vehicle that is good on gas, is reliable, room, and
with a look for the designers.
Never had a only have had Jeep Wranglers with Chrysler and
being a car and not a car person it is cool to drive at night how it lights up.
The only problem is
the AUX set broke when hooked into a I-PHONE but most factory stereo are junk any way.

Very Happy with this car and am going to set up for company used vehicle runner/ designer cars. 
COST OF OUT COME EVALUATION!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Jeff, 07/17/2016,DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL CAR!,1,"I purchased my 2006 PT brand new,and 4 clutches and over $4000 spent just on the 4 clutches later I still have the car.  Just replaced the 3rd radiator. First clutch went out at 20,000 miles and Chrysler would not cover that because they said it was wear and tear.  No I don't ride the clutch, either. The vehicle weighs 3300 pounds and drives and feels heavy, in fact it has a truck chassis. i just bought a top of the line Toyota Avalon 2015 that weighs about the same as the little PT.  Expect the PT to have  a very poor turning radius, but comfortable inside.  Very disappointing gas mileage for a 5 speed, I never got better than 21-23 in the city, I expected better.  Overall I have spend more on repairs and rental cars over the years than I paid for this car, keeping the car only because I had no other options.  Just spend over $2000 on a timing belt (I just have 120,000 miles) and another $450 on a radiator, the third one.  I guess I'm a glutton for punishment.  Some things I do like, the back seat folds down and the storage capacity for a small car is excellent.   If your considering this car, I would totally stay away from the 5 speed at any cost and keep in mind the older model cars (like mine) have timing belts instead of timing chains, much more expensive to replace, so make sure you check that out before buying any PT model.

After only 6 months with a brand new PT Cruiser I had to have the engine replaced and the entire electrical wiring replaced. The car has spent more time in the shop than it has spent in my drive way. Do not buy a pt cruiser. 
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Bob, 12/02/2006,My PT Cruiser,4,"This is my everyday drive to work car. Mine is the five-speed stick wagon. The edmunds review does not do the standard engine justice when paired with the manual trans. It has more torque and off-the-line power than the '95 Neon I used to drive. This is a nice car to drive in most any traffic with the hydraulic clutch and a nice shifter feel. This is no hot-rod by any means but it is a nice, useful flexible car."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Cindy, 08/09/2008,Luvin my buggy,4,"I have had a Blue/gray Turbo convertible for 1 year purchased used at 6000 miles.  Luv it.  Like the roll over bar. VERY disappointed that Chrysler is discontinuing the convertible.  Needs Improvement with gas mileage, rear visibility, turning radius.  Would love GPS, self dimming rear view, and backup warning system  Otherwise, everything I wanted in an economical classy convertible, a real head turner.  "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,pt109, 07/08/2010,New arrival,4,"I've had less than a week and have put almost 800 miles on the the little thing. Last car was a Crown Vic so torque seems a bit on the thin side. Love the top down and quiet with top up. as far as styling goes people either love or hate them. I love it. every time I get behind the wheel I think beetle because of the body color dash and view over the hood. Ride/handling trade off seems perfect for this sporty but not sports car. I was hoping for better mileage than my Vic but so far it is about the same. Disappointing for a 4 Cylinder, but I didn't buy it because it was an econobox."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Anonymous, 12/06/2010,Family pet,4,"We bought this car new.  180 hp turbo has get up and go. Amazingly comfortable, expecially considering exterior dimensions. Seats front and rear are comfortable. Lots of room. Easy to see out of. Ride is smooth. We take it on trips in preference to our 2005 Volvo V70 2.5T. Very reliable. Only one repair: windshield washer nozzle replaced. Dealer says front brakes look like they haven't been used. We love our Cruiser."

I haven't had any problems with it so far. I have seen a few reviews about mileage complaints but so far its doing great on gas. It's stylish, comfortable, and most importantly affordable for me. I am most definitely happy about this decision."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,blue star, 06/29/2008,Love My PT GT!,4,"According to my service adviser the PT is among a few cars that only come in for maintenance.  I drive approximately 100 miles per day and she is a joy to drive. It has loads of passenger room, the rear seats fold down flat to allow a good surface to carry lots of things. The controls are easy to access, she drives smooth as silk and the stiffer suspension lets me enjoy curves.  She has new Eagle Tires which are an improvement over the originals, the Turbo is responsive, fit and finish is very good, bluetooth, sirius radio and 6 CD changer. Originally I leased a Touring model to be sure, I'm sure I love this car.  It's distinctive styling is a stand out but she's not just beautiful..."

I always had luxurious European cars with big engines. I also spent lots of money for them. With P.T. I get the same pleasures for a lot less money.  It is not as powerful engine as my previous cars, but I cant ask for more. Still, it is fast when you need to get out of the way, and that is what counts!  With P.T. I am getting luxury and economy all in one cute little funky wagon! P.T. is a great women car!  I am a female professional and P.T. makes me look good."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,l8dybg79, 08/04/2011,Looks were deceiving.... VERY disappointed,2,"PLEASE reconsider if you are wanting to buy a PT.
I bought my '06 used, but only 11 months old & very few miles.
I have had a lot of AC problems, heater core, wheels, brakes, and tire problems.
AND the back door lock doesn't work (gets stuck locked) until you manually unlock it... a pain when you have kids.

It handled well on snow/ice.
But that about the only positive thing I can think about it.

The biggest complaint I have is the 18-19 mpg!
And thats driving 20 miles highway to & from work every day!
WHAT A GAS HOG!!!! NOT WHAT THEY SAY IT GETS.
And.. I keep up with the maintenance... oil changes, etc.
I would definitely reconsider buying a PT Loser! "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Harvey Clark, 10/15/2016,cute ain't always good,2,"This car gets about 16 mpg city and 21 mpg hwy, and MUST have premium fuel. Repairs are VERY expensive and best done by a dealer, you will not be able to do anything yourself. The entire car is poorly engineered. The battery is half hidden under the fender and very hard to get in and out, I tried to replace it once and did $250 in damage to surrounding parts ( plastic- dealer only ). The drivers seat adjustment switch is molded into a large plastic panel on the side of the seat. If you are short enough to comfortably drive the car, then you are to short to get in and out without putting pressure on this piece. Ours has broken twice, it's $350 to replace ( dealer only ). These are just two examples.This is my wifes' car ( her 2nd ) and has only 70K miles since purchasing it new, the AC is currently out for the 5th time. When I drive the car, I tilt my head to the right to keep from touching the headliner, and still have limited forward visibility. The roof line is so low in front it is a chore to see a traffic light and I am just a little shy of 6 FT. By the way, her first PT cruiser had to have an engine replacement at 13K miles.

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,bacon777, 06/22/2012,"177,000 Miles Later",3,"I bought this car in 2007 as a used car and got my moneys worth.
I just passed the 177,000 mark and have had no serious issues but decided to trade it in after I started having my first mechanical problems.
The thermostat went bad and then the heater core followed so instead of paying 800 to fix it, I decided it was time to trade it in, but 177,000 miles without any mechanical issues is impressive.
Drives nice, was reliable, and fairly inexpensive but parts can be constly.
I was told because it uses Mercedes parts as Mercedes owned Chrysler.
Also, you have to deal with the ridicule of driving a PT Cruiser but if you're an older lady, you shouldn't have that problem"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,What was I thinking?, 10/18/2008,What was I thinking?,2,I have a 2006 PT. The gas mileage is robbing me blind. I had only had the car for 4 months when the air condition may the car run hot. I would have to pull over for it to cool off. I was stuck out of town when it first happened. I missed 2 day of work. The steering wheel shakes. I've had the tires rotated and aligned. I say it at least once a day that I hate this car.

HOW TO CLEAN THE SEATS: Use Woolite Oxyclean Spray...it removes all stains and makes the seats look new again.  I've had this car at the dealership too many times (thank God I have a warranty).  Would not recommend this car to consumers.  Overpriced new...and taking a BIG chance buying it used.  Lastly, it's a gas guzzler."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Michael, 09/11/2005,GT Turbo,4,"This PT is fun to drive and has more than enough power. Gas mileage is not great but respectable. Handles good on the highway. Manufacturer paid a lot of attention to detail and it shows. Turning radius needs to be corrected, cannot make a u turn and expect not to hit curbs. Needs light in glovebox and under the hood. Owner's manual should be for each model instead of multi-models."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Kasia, 09/24/2005,Base Convertible is an amazing value,4,"I purchased my '05 base convertible for less than $18K.  It now has 19,000 miles on it.  It is far better built, better looking, and better performing than its modest price would suggest.  I average about 28 mpg in mostly highway driving, but the mpg drops dramatically in city cycle driving.  Caveats for winter drivers: ""SmartGlass"" windows freeze in cold weather, and the side defoggers are weak for harsh winter conditions.  Overall, a great value!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,LLG, 08/21/2005,Love in Bloom,4,"I really love this car.  It is fun fun fun to drive and I love fussing over it at home like I was seventeen again and it's 1969. The dealership was totally awesome..no pressure they didn't know they were making a sale by leaving me alone with this beauty. The ease of the top is great and makes it accessible at a moments notice. I named mine ""The Last Hurrah!!"" Also the PT cruiser itself never really did much for me...but this convertable just said we were made for each other!!!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,rpesti, 09/12/2006,'06 PT Cruiser convert,4,"I like this ""little"" car. Excellent seating (i'm 240 6ft) seat a little hard, may soften up. Could be softer like the sebring seats- it's a cruiser after all.  Basically, all is well but the gas mileage. I'm not a leadfoot driver but i'm getting 17 mpg/city 22 highwy. Much different than what brochures say. Purch 6/06 1850mi at 9/06. Called both dealer and mfr & they say you know -these mileage estimates are done under certain conditions & everyone will get different mpg according to their driving habits Blah,blah,blah. Seems the engine is too small for the size of this car like it's under a load and straining  i have the touring ed w/ turbo.  I look forword for the v6 edtion!"

It turned out to be a great buy - only had 2 warranty-covered problems.  I traded it on the 2006 with 23K miles.  The '06 is fantastic -  nice upgrades from the '01.  Mileage could be better although the '06 is better than the '01 - needs another gear - 5-spd auto.  But all in all, a pleasure to own - really cheap to own. Cost me $600/year in depreciation to own the '01."

Then on the 11th of Dec. I started to hear a noise in the front end and the engine was shaking so, I figured I would have it looked at when I got my next check. Well every day it would start out ok but after the 3rd day I stopped driving it. The reason I stopped driving it was because on my way home with my dogs and I was coming up to a red light and there was a truck in front of me and I had the brakes pushed as far down as I could when the brakes did not even work and a terable grinding sound so I  pulled the park brake and still hit the truck...we were ok just shaking and the truck...But what gets me is the brake light has never come on , or a airbag deploy...I will try to sell it but I will let them know of this problem and im sure to lose a good part of what I paid..Let's just say people have to die before a recall on most all parts and y his car is truly not safe.

Fast forward to two years later we have had new bushings, new engine, new axle, and much much more work done to it. It still shakes in third gear they cant seem to fix it and it is not a normal shake the original dealer that we bought it from has finally said it is normal and won't have anymore to do with it.

It is a base model but has a lot of options that others don't offer. Have had a lot of compliments from people i've never seen before. Only thing that I'm not really thrilled about is the gas mileage , or should i say the lack of gas mileage. Highway mileage averages about 23 or 24, not good.  Other than that it's a really awesome car."

I don't think I am getting any better mileage. I too have had with water/snow staining the seats,they look terrible. I have had my car at the dealer 5 times now over the last month. The power steering unit went out. I had also reported a leak. The first time was reported over-filling off fluid, continued leak. I believe an oil ring was replaced, still a leak. Today I am told the head gasket needs replaced. I will never buy a Cruiser/Chrysler vehicle ever. I am greatly dissapointed in what I can't wait to get rid of it!"

I was looking for something with good fuel economy as I drive 90% in the city. I liked the looks of the PT and the salesman talked me into it due to it having a gas ""sipping"" 4 cylinder.  I have no idea how people are getting 17 or more mpg?  I've put in new plugs, tuned it, and put in a KN high flow filter and I average 15.9 mpg with a standard commute. The shop says ""to bad"". I gave up 4 wheel drive, room, and v8 performance for an extra 3mpg?  I've had similar problams with water staining the seats, I can't get the headrest in a comfortable spot, and the speakers already sound like they are about to blow? I would never buy one again."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,anniepoo, 01/27/2008,Love it,4,"I traded in my Jeep Grand Cherokee for this fun, zippy little car after renting one while on vacation. I have always wanted a convertible, and living in Austin, we have the perfect weather for it, seeing as we really only have about 2 weeks of winter here. It is such a blast to leave work, put the top down and take the long way home.  I get lots of comments on how 'cute' it is compared to the standard 4 door model."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Ms. Lee, 08/07/2009,No Regrets So Far,3,"This was a used car purchase. I love the style & design of the car but everything else is pretty much a disappointment.  The gas mileage is poor, the seats are uncomfortable and stained, the window openers should be on the door, making a U-turn is a joke, the car shakes a bit at 65 MPH, and it is hard to see out from the back and front sloping window design (very dangerous). Luckily I have had no problems with the engine, steering or anything electrical. (keeping my fingers crossed).  "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,cool car, 10/31/2009,cool car,3,i purchased this car after renting one love the ride and power rentel had 42000 miles on it i bought this one brand new at first hated it it was bad on gas but after about 25000 miles it was like some one flipped a switch 24 mpg and car is driven by two different drivers would own another one curently have 50000 miles on it
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,musemgr, 05/23/2010,If you have a big butt like me,4,"Then this might not be the car for you. I traded in my luxury car for this due to the recession and I love that it's dependable and economical re gas, service and repairs. It's a little noisy (but I admit I was spoiled) but the cost differential makes up for it. Oh and don't go without Cruise control. I hate that I'm missing cc."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Yolanda Johnson, 08/26/2005,gas guzler,2,My biggest problem is gas. This car eats up gas.Under the hood is too compacted. Can't see anything or if anything is leaking
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Gerry Grossman, 10/29/2005,Stylin' and Smilin',4,"The PT is a comfortable, beautifully designed sun-tanning machine.  With the turbo it is fun to drive, and with the top down, it's a blast."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Brad, 05/08/2006,2005 GT/2006 Limited Owner Reviews,4,"Have two - a 2005 GT and a 2006 Limited.  The 2005 GT is truly an amazing car for the money with great build quality.  Visually, the design integrates some of the best styling cues of the 30s and 40s, but the design and engineering is cutting-edge.  I haven't had this much fun and performance since my 1964 GTO!  The 2006 Limited gets over 25 MPG, is comfortable and a great value.  Both have lots of room and a solid, quality feel."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Gloria, 08/09/2006,Love this car,4,"Love how the car handles and looks.  I've wanted one after I first saw the first one come out.  I have an electric blue.  My youngest son said why did you buy one of these, but after he road in it he loved it.  I have all the special features, heated leather seats, sun roof, 6 disk cd player, auto stick, and more.  It has the speed, smooth ride and is a blast to drive.  My husband dosen't get to drive it much because I love it so much.  Also my friends that have been in it also love it.  "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,PT Cruiser Facts, 08/16/2006,Too expensive with the gas prices,3,"I am at 12,000 miles now and getting 17 highway mpg.  I have the 4 cyclinder engine so there is no power and no fuel economony.  The car also needs a 1/4 mile to turn so its not the most nibble bike on the block.  The car has no wind silencers so you may want to bring your earplugs if your going to be going over 50.  The car is attractive and very spaciouse but when a minivan made by the same company gets better gas milage something is wrong."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,karl, 09/01/2006,fun to own,4,"i have really enjoyed my 2006 cruiser the 2nd month after i bought it i hit and killed 2 deer while going 40mph the only damage was it knocked out the black plastic in the front bumper and cracked the clearcoat on the bumper. i get around 22-23 mpg and i have an k&n airfilter in the airbox. the a/cdoes ok but when you switch it to recirculate it does very good. i do recommend a bra for this car because of the front design, bugs love to hit it. the seats inside are very firm  that is a minor drawback, lots of room inside also"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Carrie, 01/25/2007,My first American Made Car,4,"This is my first American Made car.  I love the styling, the color and the ride.  I am VERY disappointed in the gas mileage however.  I was told by my dealership and by most websites that this car would get an average of 30+ mpg, it's a 4-cylinder so why wouldn't it???  Mine averages 17-19 in the city and 23-25 on the highway and this is when I am actively trying to keep my mileage down...no idle, coasting when I am able, avoiding accelerating.  This is unacceptable and it would have prevented me from buying this car had I been told the actual numbers.  American automakers have got to get fuel economy in check if they want to compete.  I will be going back to Japanese on my next car purchase."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Scalhoun, 06/06/2007,Love my PT,4,My PT has been a great car. No mechanical problems at all. My only suggestion would be to make the headrest more comfortable. It tilts forward or isn't the right height for my height. It's to tall. This makes me lean forward the whole time I'm driving. It's the only complaint I have about this vehicle at all.
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Blake, 09/29/2007,Fun car to drive,4,"I bought this car when I transferred to L.A. and couldn't be happier.  It is fun to drive, great retro look and has excellent pickup.  I looked at several convertibles and found the Cruiser to be the best value for the money.  Has the weight and feel of the pricier convertibles - more car than the Miata.  Bought the fully loaded model and got a better discount."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,robin toth, 04/03/2008,really nice,4,"This little car rides good in winter, and I only had all season tires on- lots of snow and some ice on roads.. It is fairly quiet although the heater is noisy when on. Overall very satisfactory vehicle"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,56981101, 05/05/2008,Radiator replaced TWICE,3,"Have had radiator replaced twice - both times the radiator CRACKED - first time, hit a small cat, second time, a pothole in the road.  Currently having problems with the car overheating and no one can find anything wrong with it.  Purchased in December of 2006, basic model.  Our only requirements were that it fit three car seats in the back (it does), and that it have A/C (it does not, although we were told it did).  Not happy with this vehicle overall.  Will be trading soon, if we can get a decent trade-in on it.  Not counting on that, though.  I agree with the person who said PT Cruisers are lemons."

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Joel Sander, 07/14/2006,06 PT 4dr Touring Edition,4,"We bought this vehicle for 4 reasons, American made, unique looks, economical price, and fuel economy. We are very pleased with it, after several months of driving now, and about 5,000 miles on the ticker. With the cruise control set at 62 mph on the highway, (I'm in no hurry) I can get 35 mpg all day long. It is roomy for a small vehicle, and quite comfortable. With the 5 spd manual it is a fun, spirited car to drive. 0-60 takes only 8.5 seconds. It is a lot of vehicle for the price you pay, and as reliable and trust worthy as the family golden retriever. If you are looking for a bargain in today's $3/ gal. society, and like to buy ""American"", look no further."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,mrloyd, 08/12/2008,Horrible car,1,"The car gets 17 mpg, which is awful. You can't see traffic lights if you are the first car because of the sloping roof. The seat feels like you are on a bar stool and about to fall off, and is so narrow you have to sit on top of the bolsters, and I am thin! Front end drags when you hit the slightest dip. When cornering, tornado effect throws all loose items around car. Passengers usually complain of motion sickness. If something falls off the seat you will have to pull over to retrieve it. If you try to get something out of the passenger floor, the seatbelt will stab you in the ribs quite painfully. The removable seats are so heavy you can't remove them, or but them back. This car is terrible"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Spencer, 05/12/2010,Good car overall.,4,"I have had the car for almost a year now and am happy overall with the car. It has good power with the turbo, but the engine is a little loud under hard power. I have had a 2001 limited PT and a 2005 Convertible base. They all have been great cars, but the non-turbos have no power. The interiors on the 2001 and 2005 are far better then the 2006. The seats are notas good and the fit and finish is not as good on the 2006. Winter traction is very poor, but it is fwd. The headrests of the 2006 are very poor as well. Reliability has been very good on all the cars. The GT rides a little ruff, but handles well. The Turbo is quick, but nothing great. I have a 2006 Mini Cooper S which is faster"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Jo, 02/03/2007,Hmmm...,3,"After 1 year I am averaging 17 mpg I get excuses from service dept. ""You don't drive it right, different emissions, only under certain circumstances. will you get good MPG, the car is new, others are getting less (and this is something to be proud of?) When will the fuel mileage increase? I even got a call from Chrysler Corp. More excuses..."

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,1Daddeo, 12/03/2008,Car with pep,4,"We test drove a regular PT and found it to be sluggish. We just about gave up on the PT, when I found out that the GT version has 230 HP (I chirped tire in 2nd gear on the automatic) as opposed to the standard 150 HP. The car is not only stylish, but has tons of energy. The suspension and steering are tight and responsive. The new interior fits well the exterior. I only wished they did a few things extra like a glove box light, a light near the door handle and a little more chrome on a retro looking auto would help, but they make tons of aftermarket parts so you can customize to your taste."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Sidney, 08/16/2009,No worries,4,"We change our car from the Jeep to Chrysler PT, we pay $8000 and a warrant for another 70000miles. We think the price is worth, also it runs in good condition. We like the space inside, not like the Honda & Toyota's skinny space. The fuel consumption is reasonable too. We like it."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,mw, 06/21/2010,Worst Money Pit Ever,3,"I bought this car with low mileage as a dealer shuttle car.  I figured since the dealer used it to simply shuttle people back and forth it would be reliable.  Wrong, even the best mechanic couldn't save the horrible reliability of Chrysler.  I have spent over $3500 in repairs to keep the car from over heating and to regulate the engine fans.  My mechanic said he sees this all the time on Chrysler cars.  No wonder this company cant stay afloat.  I will never ever buy another Chrysler again.  Thanks for making the WORST American made cars around.  Stick to Ford."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,S Ramos, 09/10/2005,Glad to have it,4,"I like the fuel economy.  That I have a better view, because I sit up higher than a sedan.  Visibility all round is very good because of the larger mirrors and windows. The metallic blue color I selected (electric blue) really stands out on a sunny day and evenings."

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Robyn, 07/06/2008,Horrible Gas Mileage,3,"I bought this car new after selling a 1996 Ford Explorer.  I thought with a 4 cyl it would get good gas mileage. It was HORRIBLE. My '96 Explorer got better.  I kept it for 18 months, and recently traded it in for a Chevrolet HHR.  I was very disappointed in the gas, and at over $4.00 a gallon, could not justify keeping it any longer."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Naomi, 07/30/2008,Worst gas mileage ever!,4,"I am getting between 11 and 14 mpg!  I love the car and receive many compliments.  Then, I tell them about the gas mileage.  Chrysler has lost several sales because of the mileage.  Much as I do not want to, I am seriously thinking of trading in the car because I cannot afford to drive it."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Soccer Mom, 08/19/2008,Disappointed,2,I have had this vehicle for a little less than 2 years and I am seriously worried that it will not last another 3 years.  I downsized from an SUV to save on gas only to find out that I average 23.5 mpg in this 4 cyl car.  My SUV got 20-21 avg.  I am very disappointed with the overall structure and mechanical performance.  My 6 year old broke the glove box latch by trying to open it. Won't buy another Chrysler.
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,dutchman, 08/19/2008,PT ruined 2 holidays with malfunctions.,3,"We fell for the shape of the PT. thus far we had two major failures (engine management system blocked the car because of 'blocked fuel line'??. replaced spark plugs and cables (myself, check the costs!)) and have had the antenna replaced 4 times. Still don't have reception, only in larger populated areas. Consumption in congested cities like where we live is absolutely sky-high. We hit the 14.1 liter/100km every so often. Doors creak terribly, it wakes our sleeping son in the backseat. Materials are bad: seat material stains with water (unbelievable but true!),dashboard creaks,a rattle inside te steering column. Good things? The looks, but the novelty wears quickly. The headroom in the back"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,HateThisCar2008, 09/01/2008,What A Piece of Junk!,3,"Bought used with just under 20K on it, and now has 25K. Had for just 5 months. In that time, the 1st time we turned on the a/c the car would shudder/stumble and then almost stall. They replaced the compressor. After that, it did the same thing (which they said was normal, ha!), but then it didn't even blow cold. They replaced the fan control module. Then the lower control arm bushings needed to be replaced. And now the car is going out of control in traffic! Step on the gas, it doesn't kick into gear, and when it finally does go, the power steering goes out and you're lucky you don't die! But the dealer gets no codes and it test drives fine, so it MUST be fine according to them. NOT!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Unpleased...., 09/04/2008,Can only Blame Myself,2,This is the first car that I got financed and in the spirit of wanted to trade this trash in I finally started reading reviews of other vehicles. I decided to see the reviews on the 2006 PT Cruiser that I currently own and must say AMEN to gas mileage being a joke and I never knew water could stain like coffee. I can only blame myself for not reading reviews before purchasing.
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Button, 09/04/2008,Bad Dangerous Buy,1,I am very disappointed in my PT cruiser. Steering ratio super bad. Visibility when backing is dangerously bad. There are blind spots. Looking to buy another car and other brand as soon as possible.
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Italian Capricorn, 10/24/2008,"A good deal, but nothing to brag about",3,"It is not an economy car.  I purchased it for my son, who just got his driver's license.  The back seats can be removed, which is a plus when a teenager is driving the car.  Studies show that the collisions occurs when a number of teenagers are in the same car.  Reducing that number to only a driver and a passenger reduces the risk."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,summergurl08, 12/10/2008,Hate It,3,"I bought this car a year ago thinking I would be much happier with this car then my previous one but i hate it. Water stains the seats. It really makes the interior look terrible. I had to replace tires on this car after only having 20,000km's on it. I drive this car in the winter and half the time the fan doesn't work. Try driving a car with fogged windows all the time! I am looking to get out of this car very soon and would not recommend this vehicle to anyone"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Billysandiego, 12/13/2008,This car stinks,2,"I downsized from my F-150 hoping to save on gas mileage, so far, not that great. But the upside is that as currently it stands the radio turns on and off when it feels like it. Only my right front blinker works. My battery dies if you leave the radio on(when it decides to work) for more that 5 minutes. The 12 volt plug in the center console doesnt work. The airbag light comes on just for fun. The automatic door opener in the back works when it feels like it. I'm just waiting to see what else on this car falls apart. But I like the interior design. Oh and yeah water does stain the seats. Thank God I live in San Diego where it doesnt rain that much."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,PTsilver, 12/16/2008,Good car for the money,3,"I am not sure how people are getting less than 20 mpg. I have the standard engine, automatic transmission, and am getting 22 city and 25 highway MPG.  You cannot drive this car like it's a Corvette. Revving the engine up to 4.5K rpm routinely isn't your friend. I bought the car used with approximately 50k miles, and am really enjoying it. No issues to date so far, and it's a joy to drive.  Styling is retro, which is a huge change from my prior car (Lincoln Continental). The engine is a bit sluggish, but it is not a blemish on the enjoyment factor. I have experienced a bit of engine vibration at higher RPM's, but it's not too noticeable.  Fit/finish is fine...no issues. "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,RIMIKE, 12/29/2008,Good enough,4,"Gas mileage is great with an aftermarket air filter-26 to as much as 30 MPG. Seat material is prone to staining. After 30,000 miles steering has a slight shimmy at 20 to 30 mph. I liked my 2001 plain jane with 4 wheel disc brakes much better."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,SCGURL1974, 04/01/2009,Piece of junk,1,I have never owned a car that has had so many issues! I bought this vehicle almost brand new and in as little as a year I already had issues with the fuel pump and a year later my power steering has gone out. Of course it is no longer under warranty so I have had to pay all this out of pocket. The dealership mechanic told me he sees the cruiser all the time. I should have kept my Kia!! This vehicle is a piece of junk and I am stuck with it. Chrysler should be ashamed and I will be writing them a letter.
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,mdthompson, 05/23/2009,Learn to drive before you whine,4,"I use my cruiser to deliver pizza.  It never gives me any problems in any type of weather.  I have seat covers so staining is no issue for me.  If you know how to drive correctly and take care of your vehicle it will reward you.  The only time I've had to take it to a dealership is for body work after people ran into me, which stopped after I got flame decals applied.  I've put more mileage on my cruiser than anyone here and it never fails to perform."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,jms, 07/08/2009,Money Pit on Wheels,2,"In the year and a half that I have owned ny cruiser, it has had repairs done on steering problems 5 times.  I think the whole steering system must be new!  Also, the air conditioning drags the idle speed down when waiting for traffic lights."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Wallstherb, 07/10/2009,PT is the best bang for the buck in NYC,4,"I love my little tank.  It takes the streets of NYC without fail and the only problem in the gas.  For a little car it drinks gas in traffic.  I love the fact it is little for parking and the room is great inside.  For the money I love it in Brooklyn, NY and with the cost so low I can get the bumpers re-painted from everyone hitting me when parked.  A++ for anyone in NYC who wants a car!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Peggy, 08/18/2009,I love mine!,4,I personally have not had any problems with my cruiser. It has plenty of room for a 4 cyl and plenty of storage and space if needed. We have 5 people in our family and can all take long trips in comfort and style. We have owned numerous vehicles with no such luck. Gas is really good in mine and it still drives like a new car. No problems what-so-ever. I would definitely recommend this car to others. My mother in law has had one for the last 7 years and has never had a problem with hers. She just loves it. She recently traded hers in for a 2008. Good luck to everyone and hopefully you will enjoy yours as much as we do ours!
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,texas cruisin, 11/25/2009,Fun Fun Fun,4,"This car is just plain fun.  I have always driven large SUV's because of kids, but loved the look of the PT Cruiser.  I bought this one for a steal and I LOVE it.  It is responsive.  It makes me happy to drive it.  It never fails.  The positioning of the instruments have taken getting used to, but I think it all lends to the different kind of car you see from the out side.  Fuel economy is a about 20 city 24 highway for me.  The seats do stain very easily so I bought covers.  I love driving this car."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,michigan pt, 01/02/2010,"looks great, but",3,"wish the car rode better, mpg is very disapointing 20-22 city and highway. expected more on highway. purchased new and spent multiple times in shop for sensors. paid for bumper to bumper warranty. brakes seem bad since new and has always had weird steering shimmy-like bad rotors, was told there was no problem and they turned the rotors. thankful i bought the warranty 60 months/65000 miles. no out of pocket. learned my lesson with my LHS, which i miss, that was a great car."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Still Cruising, 01/25/2010,Parking Challenged,4,"I bought my Limited Turbo new.  It was the styling that sold me. I love the roomy interior vs: the small exterior. Tall people don't do too well in the back seat however, (heads rub the roof).  The original tires all went bad before 25K. Mechanically it has been sound. Has plenty of power for my needs. MPG could be better.  Turning radius is wide so plan ahead, that's my only real beef right now. No issues as of 28K. Overall I have been happy with this car. Someday I may even calibrate the compass.

My extended warranty of course is over and the motor blew! This is the most unreliable car I have ever had. The customer service stinks with Chrysler. I wish I could get out of the car, but resale on these is so low I'm stuck with it."

But we were being blown by Aveos, Corollas, Sentras and Neons.  It's fuel economy averaged about 21. In handling my Corolla CE could run circles around it.

I love the look, and it drives so smooth. You have to go and test drive this car. I'm a single mom and have a 1 yr old we are so happy, we found the perfect car for us!! Thank you Chrysler for building this vehicle. "

It is a reliable and fun car. I get good performance from the PT.  It is easy for seniors to get in and out because it is a bit higher and our folks like to ride in my car.  Seats 4 adults comfortably and can have 5 if younger children in back.  There is enough leg room in both front and back.  Good trunk space.  Great for tailgating/picnics - having the table in the trunk area.

I needed all 3 as a second car with little time to dicker about it.. and this car excels in all 3 areas - and I can't beleive what a fantastic buy this was for under 14K! If you're looking for good reliable ""basic transportation"" and don't want to break the bank.. check this out. It's one of America's best kept secrets!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,speedo, 02/22/2006,2006 PT,2,Roomy Interior for bigger people with great leg room. Nice cargo space.Poor Fuel Mileage on automatic standard 4 cyl. Poor steering wheel placement for long rides. Easily fatigued on long rides over 150 miles for large/tall people. Performance lacks in every aspect.Rides like a cheap import. Brakes are somewhat lacking. Could use 4 wheel disc standard.
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Fran, 03/28/2006,Cute little retro car,5,My Mom has had a PT Crusier since 2001.  I was looking for a car and decided to look at the 2006 PT.  This is a wonderful car with so much character.  The upgrades that have been done since 2001 are amazing. The retro look really works well. I cannot wait to save money on gas this will be a huge savings. 
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Bob, 04/11/2006,Great Car,4,I went from an 88 Jaguar XJ6 to a 2006 PT Cruiser basic and am very happy with it.  It rides well and feels substantial.  I was taken with the exterior design when they first came out but didn't like the dark interior. The 2006 has a great interior and friends with more expensive cars have love the dash.
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Mikekoz13, 05/08/2006,Great car!,4,"What a great car. After totaling my Aztek, I looked at a lot of car models. They all looked very generic to me with the exception of a couple of Hondas & Toyotas.... and the Cruiser. I don't pay extra for the ""privilege"" of owning a Japanese car so I looked at the Cruiser at my salesman's suggestion. I couldn't believe I could get a car this nice for an on the road price of less than $14000. I was a little worried about gas mileage after reading some reviews but I'm averaging 27MPG combined and almost 31MPG highway. WOW! I'm only sorry that I didn't buy a Cruiser the last time I purchased a vehicle two years ago."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,mrssgtjones, 05/19/2006,Loads of fun,4,"I love this car! I wanted something a little bigger than a compact sedan, but didnt want the fuel consumption of an SUV or the dreaded station wagon. This car is cute, affordable, reliable and has the perfect amount of space for a family of three on a road trip. The only things I would change are the seats. They could use widening. I'm not overweight, but my behind hangs over a little, and the turning radius is a little wide. Other than that, its perfect!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,mrsestanley, 05/22/2006,"cute, but 90% wrong",3,"i find this car to look great, but inside, i have a horrible time getting used to it.  my husband is 6'5"" and 300 lbs and he can drive it with no problem.  however, the window levers are placed in the middle of the dash and that is an awkward place, the cup holders sit in awkward positions and aren't suitable for most drink or cups, the steering wheel doesn't adjust much, the seat are so hard and the front sits so low that it's already cracked from speed bumps.  i like it, but would definitely shop more for something less awkward.  oh, acceleration and gas mileage are awful.  it costs $45 to fill up with today's gas prices and it rags during acceleration and is LOUD!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Sarah, 06/17/2006,Get'cha one!,4,"People definitely have a ""love-hate"" relationship with the pt cruiser style; they either love it or they hate it.  I, of course, loved it.  When it first came out in 2001 it was too pricy for me but when I realized how steeply the price had dropped I had to have it.  My previous vehicle was an SUV and this was an EASY change for us, a family of three.  The cruiser is at least as roomy and much, much more fun.  I've always loved the exterior which hasn't changed much over the years and was pleasantly surprised with the interior of the 2006 as well. This car feels, rides and handles great. I can't believe the price is as low as many MUCH less impressive vehicles. "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Toledonana, 07/08/2006,not happy with 06 'improvments',4,"I've had 2 Croozers, 00 and 02, and the 06 seats are awful!! I was so disappointed when I test-drove I may go look for an 05 instead.  It feels like you're sitting ON the car now instead of IN it.  There's less headroom than before and the whole interior feels smaller. I'm 5'6"" 220 and I'm not comfortable in this car anymore...it makes me cry!  I've got to hold down the cost so I can't go for a Limited or GT with their adjustable seats, even if I knew it would help! I've even looked into getting the seats rebuilt aftermarket but it's crazy that I have to even consider it.  I love the rest of the car but the seat problem is too big to ignore.  What a shame they improved the wrong thing."

The one I chose is the basic PT Cruiser but it had to be Electric Blue! This little baby gets super mileage and it is soooooo comfortable and has lots of room for passengers as well as the hatchback area holds alot too! I love shopping at Lowes and have toted home alot of plants, mulch, etc and this car can handle anything I purchase and then some in the rear storage area! The '06 has been redesigned with minor changes here and there and it is a wonderful improvement on all the little extras they've put in. I am 5'7"" tall, all legs and have plenty of room in the drivers seat! Get a PT today, you won't regret it! :"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Kzac, 08/06/2006,The family truckster,3,"Fit and finish on my car have been first rate. The car is very fun to drive and handles well. The seating and view are very good. The interior space and extra storage are great. I was surprised to find out the car needed fron rotors at 15,000 miles, additionally I have never been able to achieve the rated mileage, my car gets 18-20 in the city and about 23 on the road using the cruse control at 55-60 mph.  I live in the south so we have to run the air conditioner in the summer.  I also don't like the shudder mine makes when you first start from a stop sign. It was fun to drive it through the mountians but the 18-19 mpg realy hurt our pocket book. "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Bukyman.com, 08/22/2006,Just passed 3K miles.,4,"This vehicle started the retro-craze. It is beautifully ugly! I have enjoyed every second in this still head-turning panel van. Chevy has tried to copy it recently and Ford knows better. I picked the cheapest on the lot because I needed a low cost commuter. Air is my only option, but the Cruiser comes with tilt wheel, power windows, power locks, and a stock stereo and speakers that rival my old '91 Dodge Shadow ES Turbo that I equipped with an aftermarket Sony Explode sound system. The bass on the stock 6 speaker system is incredible! The base 2.4 L 4 cylinder is more than enough to power this vehicle. By 4 cylinder standards it is fairly large and would take most 6 cylinders. I love mine!"

This car is great on corners and has an excellent pick up when you give it a little extra gas. the top is easy to put up and down the boot is a little cumbersome 'til you get used to putting it on correctly. It has been fabulous on gas, and Im getting more mileage to the gallon then it represents on the stats. The trunk is not large but the back seats go down and there is an opening from the trunk into the back seat for larger items. This is the most fun Ive had in years. Dolores "

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Frankie, 11/03/2005,Lots of fun!!,4,"I have only had my PT Cruiser for a month but a week after we got it we went on vacation to the Great Smokey Mountains. It was wonderful riding through the mountains with the top down. The transmission was great going up and down the mountains. We didn't use the brakes much. I love the get up and go and the sound of the turbo. The trunk held all of our luggage, plus. You just have to bend over more to get to the trunk but that was fine. I traded a Lincoln Aviator for this car and it was the best thing I have done in a long time. No regrets!!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,edna b, 11/24/2005,i like it !,4,On the whole i like it...they could have finessed it a little better..i think the 2006 has more to offer...The one thing I don't like is that when you step on the gas it has a tendency to fish tail   a little.. i am not use to that...

Only problem is that we've lost all dash lights and instruments, door locks, etc. on two separate occasions.  First time dealer replaced a computer module.  Second time it was reset.  Keeping our fingers crossed it won't happen again.  Current mileage 4500."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,BudO, 03/31/2006,Red Wagon,4,"I'm 6'2"", 240 lbs. and find the PT to be comfortable to drive except for the wings on the front seats, they dig into my thighs.  The power/torque in this engine is more (automatic transmission) than  adequate.  I have read that others are experiencing poor mpg.  I drove our new PT to Denver from our home in the mountains last week that included cross town driving for a total of 200 miles. I held it to 55/65 mph because it had 145 miles on the engine. I was very surprised to achieve 33.6 mpg.  "

I drive a 1997 Caddy with a Northstar V8 and 110000 miles on it.  On a recent trip to tampa I got 27 MPG. My wife loves the PT but a brand new 4 banger should get better gas mileage.

Retro dash with that old school clock is awsum as is the lite interior color. Finally a car with character again. Extreemly roomy interior but take home two, their small.

I really appreciate its loading capacity,  which allows me to carry big suitcases as well as my children´s musical instruments.  "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Sam and Linda, 06/14/2006,Gas mileage is great!,5,"We get 23-25 mph with air conditioning. We get 30+ on the highway. Plus, if a car cuts in front of you the PT is so easy to maneuver yet it hugs the road. We feel very safe in the car and its look is wonderful. We both love the PT so much out next and next and next car will be a PT Touring. Just wish we could get the Bright  Blue color again. Hear its not available any more! "

I drive 400+ miles a week and get great gas mileage. Great handling on the road. Very cute look..love the look. Priced right! As long as they are made will be only car ever owned. Storage capability is excellent. Chrysler has surpassed any other car maker with the pt cruiser. No comparisons! In a category all its own.
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,Jeff, 09/07/2006,Great car,5,Bought my mother age 78 a Stock 4 door PT Cruiser. The car came Nicely equipped and rides like a bigger car. The 4 cylinder is bigger than most. It has full size 15 inch wheels and lots of head and legroom. The new interior is excellent for the 2006 model year. She got the car for $2200 down and $120 a month for a 27 month lease.  Great deal on a 4 door sedan.
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,sumner baum, 09/13/2006,Chrysler GT PT Cruiser,4,"This is a fun car to drive with two exceptions: 1.With the turbo, it gets about 15.3 mpg in combined city/hgwy driving. 2.The turning radius is very large requiring back and forth motion.  On the plus side, the car is very tight and the driver's seat can be adjusted very high making it very comfortable."

The handling in the limited edition is good as is the ride, for a small car."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,ckrivin, 12/19/2006,Base PT Cruiser... a dissapointment,3,"I'm happy with the build quality, room and reliability.  But the car is not very good for highway cruising; it is noisy, vibrates at speed and doesn't have much passing power.  Also the gas mileage ... it gets just what the window sticker says, but not the greatest for a smallish car."

It's small on the outside, extremely versatile and roomy on the inside, with great headroom. The engine could be a bit zippier, but the car is very well laid out and it feels extremely tight and rattle free.

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,crystal, 03/12/2007,Better GPH and a lil' more pickup,4,"We just purchased this car last month. It seemed like the MPG was going well at first, but it took a downfall. I am an all city driver and need good GM. I am sad that I was mislead on the MPG. This car is a little sluggish on acceleration (turbo may be better). Other than these two things I totally love the car! While I can live with a little bit of slug I can't live with MPG. Sadly, it may have to go when I can get something else. Or, maybe they will improve it next year and I can get a better PT. I think they look smoking hot. - Hope this helps anyone looking at these cars."

So far, after 9000+ miles my highway average is 21.5 mpg. I owned a 1990 Plymouth Sundance got 31 mpg highway. I'm very dissatisfied with this. I talked with the dealer and their statement was ""that's about it"".  TV commericals states PT gets 29 mpg.  Not true,very poor."

Every time I turn around something is wrong and I am always told by the dealer that the car is fine well then in about 2 weeks the car is tore up again. I really can't wait to get sell this car and just b/c I have had bad customer service with this car I would never buy another Chrysler again. Oh, wait, and when it's raining if the rain gets on the seats it will stain big time. It has a really wide turning radius. Don't buy a PT."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2006,kt, 04/17/2008,Too Many Repairs,2,"Loved my cruiser for first 32,000 miles. I traveled extensively in my job so maintenance is always a priority. In 50,000 miles bushings replaced, left front wheel bearing and it's still not fixed. The other wheel bearings will need replacing which shouldn't have occurred for a much longer time. Transmission problems, over 4 RPM going 50 mph even though the dealership said it was fine. Difficult to handle on the highway which wasn't a problem in beginning. Met other 2006 owners who travel a lot experiencing similar problems. One who buys PT Cruisers said 2006 has more problems than all the other PT Cruisers he has owned. Maybe this is why they didn't put the 100,000 mile warranty.  "

After a couple years it started making a loud  noise when I turned the wheel to park.  It got louder till one day I could hardly turn the  steering wheel.    Had a broken power steering belt. Cost around 300.00 to fix.  Couple years later, same thing happened.  It always seemed to happen in the winter when it  was cold and snowy. It happened a 3rd time!  Other than that I like the car.

Chrysler was  notified and they  stated  that this  was a service problem  and I would  have  to  have it  repaired at my expense (I  had insurance to cover  it) and  it  happened again and the  insurance  Company  replaced  the  Engine.

The ride is absolutely firm and first rate. Material quality is very good. This car is really quiet on the freeway. And, I got a lot of really great equipment with the PT. Be sure to get a Touring level with the Signature Package. The chrome wheels look great with the car. The Boston Acoustics Sound System is a must as is XM Radio. I am really doing to enjoy this car a lot. I was not expecting this much WOW factor. "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2007,mike, 12/19/2007,Happy,3,I had a Corolla but turning 50 I wanted to treat myself to something I could call mine. I don't like to spend a lot of money on cars. Driving this car makes me feel good and young like I want to just hit the open highways. So it burns a little more gas than most cars. Hey treat yourself. Don't leave too much behind because someone else will have no problem spending it. Happy motoring  
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2007,jake, 12/02/2016,The good Ole PT Loser,5,"Been a fantastic car.  Regular maintenance (especially changing the timing belt every 100,000) is important with any car, and this one is lasting because of it.  Fuel mileage could be better for a car that has a 4 cyl, but overall it isn't bad.  Has just enough power to pass and accelerate aggressively, but isn't overpowered by any means.  The transmission shifts smooth and crisp and the ride is what you'd expect from a smaller car.  It's not had to have any major repairs outside of regular maintenance and basic wear and tear stuff that goes wrong with every vehicle.  I've seen many reviews stating that these cars chew through brakes, but that's not the case with mine...I believe driving style has more to do with that than anything else.  The rear doors open farther than any other car I've ever owned and getting in and out of it is very easy, almost like getting into a small SUV.  With all the positives are some negatives.  Mine does have a little shake to it between 45 and 50 MPH, and the turn signal lever has caused me to flash my bright lights at a few people.  Overall though, everything about this little car has been up to par and well exceeded my expectations.  I will be buying another one of these when I need another car.

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2007,wiscman, 07/28/2010,"Nice car, but...",3,"Nice car. Comfortable, with high seating. Aligning the mirrors is important since there are some potential blind spots. Gas mileage poor. This fairly light weight wagon only gets about 22 - 24 mpg on long drives. My 1995 explorer with 275,000 miles got the same. City mileage is far better, however. Highway ride is a bit noisy, but not objectionable. Sporty maneuvering is not in the car's job description. My explorer again could hold a tight curve much better, and the turning radius was tighter. However, the car looks cool, with nice amenities. For replacement, I will be looking at the Kia soul or forte, or the Hyundai elantra touring."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2007,Dale, 01/13/2008,A Lot of Car for Not A Lot of Money,4,"If you're looking for a well appointed convertible but want to keep your purchase in the low teens, look no further than the Pt Cruiser Touring with the 2.4L turbo 4 cylinder.  Build quality, ride, and handling are very good.  The 4cyl is a little rough at idle but has good acceleration due to the turbo. The convertible has a heavy car feel to it.  At highway speeds, the car is suprisingly quiet with the top down.  You can carry on a conversation without shouting and/or listen to the radio.  The PT has a real backseat for two, and the trunk is adequate.  While retro styled cars are past their prime(the reason why the price is so low), the Pt is still very attractive and very fun to drive.  "

I loved the car and wish I could have kept it too! pros: fun, cute, no mechanical issues ever cons: not much room inside, bad on gas.. i did have a tear in my carpet which is odd it was barely driven... and my visor broke off one morning just simply opening it, guess the plastic was cold. For the price its an fantastic little car! I bought it at 27 years old and was so much fun. Now it was to hold my son and husband... just not enuff space.. but I will miss the ""turtle"" "

I have only had the car for about 3 years and now it over heats very easily, the check engine light will come on and it shutters, down shifts hard, and then sputters to a stop. the fan for the a/c doesn't work so the interior wont warm up in the winter now (or cool down in the summer) it has very poor gas mileage for a little car, I know its not a sports car but its gutless! I keep up on the regular maintenance (oil changes, transmission flushes, tire rotations) but cant afford to fix all the other problems that it shouldnt be having if I'm keeping up with regular maintenance! oh and the turning radius sucks! "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2007,Fred Tuttle, 08/28/2015,Mistake,2,"Purchased new.  Underpowered, yet relatively poor mileage (16 city, 24 highway),  has always consumed an excessive amount of oil (about 0.1 qt per 100 miles), and a turn radius that once got caused a traffic stop for suspicion of DUI.   Besides ordinary and expected service:  A/C fan controller failed at 35 K,  again at 70 K and again at 100 K; A/C evaporator core at 80 K;  cam  shaft sensor at 66 K, followed by a cylinder head at 80 K;  passenger seat airbag sensor failed at 70 K;  transmission failed at 90 K; and weirdly, three of four in the initial set of tire went flat within first 25 K, with no further problems after they were replaced.  Approximate  excess repair cost to date:  $15 K.    Total cost to purchase and operate to 100K:  $0.47 per mile plus insurance/interest.   Bottom line:   nice styling, reasonably roomy and comfortable, but better, cheaper options were available.

The mileage could be better, but as I'm retired, I now put on only about 1/2 the miles I did when working, and it's mostly short trips. I have back difficulties and with the Cruiser I managed to take a trip to Door Co. WI, without discomfort. Heating and cooling systems are excellent. Love the compass, outdoor temp gauge, and # of miles 'til empty. And everyone thinks it's a""cool"" car for a granny to be driving! I'm totally pleased with my PT Cruiser!"

I have actually beaten a Porche in accelerating from a dead stop...my car was first to overtake the other..but then, of course, the Porche overtook me pretty soon thereafer, even though we both started at the same time.

I've had it for 3 and 1/2 years and have put a little over 18,000 carefree miiles on it.
Well, the CD player has had a CD stuck in it since it was a month old and the front wheels love brake dust... but that was a homemade CD - so maybe it was our fault, and I don't mind cleaning the wheels (very easily done.) 
The only bad thing about the car is the gas mileage.
My other car is a Lincoln Town car, and it averages around 14 MPG (in a very hilly area just outside of Pittsburgh, PA).
My PT with a 4 cyl only averages 17MPG.
I was thinking it was because I only drive it on such a limited basis (but after reading the reviews - I have discovered diff.)"

Traded it in on a new 07 PT base Auto. trans., ac, Sirius radio, non-turbo. Replaced camshaft positioning sensor under warranty.
Currently has 25k miles on it. Never added oil to either PT in 58K mile of driving. Gas mileage for both was 18 (city) and 35 ( highway)

I suddenly needed a vehicle last year and was not prepared to spend much.  I love the comfort of the interior seating and the car handles beautifully.  Gas mileage 19-21 mpg, definitely limited power but I don't mind. Other posts are correct, the seats stain easily and the horn can stick.  Rides more like an old fashion truck than a luxury vehicle. Loads of fun!  I feel like I'm driving to the beach every time I'm in it."

Routine service like starter, alternator, brakes is all to be expected but it didn't seem to matter how much I put into it mechanically, every few months a new problem would arise. At 120k it started pouring oil out, had a blown head gasket. Kelley Blue Book value was less than an engine rebuild, so I cut my losses and donated it as is. If your thinking of getting one, don't. I wouldn't take one for free!"

Cheap to buy and maintain and insure. Production has ended at the end of 2009. Parts will be available for years. I think Chrysler made a mistake in getting rid of this one. HHR sales have never equaled PT's. This car/suv will be a retro classic and we all want to go back to the past.

I have put about 2000 miles on it so it is difficult to rate anything other than performance.  I only average about 17 mpg in all city driving and am very disappointed in that.  I have previously owned a 1999 Chevy Tracker an got about 20mpg on it doing the same type of driving under the same conditions.

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2007,Pedro, 09/21/2017,My first love affair but on wheels!,4,"Since I purchased my vehicle, it has worked in an excellent manner. I love how much space this car offers in its trunk! If you ever need more space, you can always fold the rear seat and get even more room! The stereo speakers sound nice and my stereo came with the AUX input so I can connect my phone to stream my Spotify playlists. The interior is gray so it can get dirty at times although I don't struggle with keeping it tidy.  The only things I would have liked to see on this car would be better fuel mileage (I average around 24 in city and 26 in highway) and it can have loud cabin noise whenever I have to drive on train tracks.  As for repairs, I've only had to replace all my brakes since it made a screeching sound but if you keep it on constant watch, it'll take care of you! I'd recommend this retro ride to anyone and it even beats a Trax in terms of practicality in my opinion.  I'll even want to buy a second PT Cruiser because it has been a reliable ride and I enjoy its practicality that the interior provides.

Right away it overheated and needed a new battery. The cooling fan and relays had to be replaced. I replaced spark plugs and wires with a new coil pack, new fuel injectors, map sensor, camshaft positioning sensor and it still runs like crap. I have only owned it for a couple months now and every week it is something new. I replaced front and back brake pads with new rotors and drums. There is no power to the engine and gas mileage is iffy. The whole thing shakes even after getting my tires balance twice. Overall this is a junky piece of crap and must be Chryslers April fools joke to society. I think I'll be going back to GM. I have never gotten rid of a car so soon and put so much money into it with no difference in how it runs.

Over and above that, it does seat 4 people comfortably, it has ample trunk space and it looks nice. It is not an economical vehicle. Bet on around 21mpg/overall (terrible for a 4- banger). With the auto, the engine is sluggish. It has been fairly reliable. Most issues were covered under the manufacturer's warranty and they were mostly minor (except for the CD- player, which just stopped accepting CD's and the battery going dead at 33K miles). The CD-player was replaced (w/a refurbed one). The battery was replaced (the tech told me, Chrysler refurbs all their batteries and then resells them as new in new cars?????) "

The check engine light went on and off intermittently for a year, mechanics had no idea what was wrong with it. Whenever anyone sat in the passenger seat, the airbag light dinged loudly every 5 minutes. The car shook violently when idling or over 45-50mph. At 60k miles, the engine was completely shot.

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2007,Daniel, 04/30/2009,My experience with the '07 PT Cruiser,4,"I bought my '07Cruiser touring edition in '07 and like many features of this car including: the old style look of a 1940's car, the dash board features (outside temp., compass, avg. mi. per gal., mi. till empty..etc.), good cd player, good ac and heat, unique ""handle bar"" on passenger side, well thought out middle console with 3 cup holders and middle storage with sliding arm rest, smooth ride, good brakes and easy gas pedal, back seats fold down and can come out for plenty of cargo room, stylish interior of textured material. Feels more upscale than you actually pay for it. I recommend this car to those who appreciate old style of cars & who want something that looks nice w/o paying alot."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2007,Sick to my stomach, 01/03/2008,2007 Chrysler PT Cruiser,3,"This car has by far the worst gas mileage in the CITY that I have ever experience in my life! I used to have an 84 Chevy Caprice Wagon Estate and it got better gas mileage and was a more comfortable ride. For shorter people like me (I am 5 foot 3) the car is extra roomy, but for someone a little bit taller I would be a little bit concerned in the front seats. I simply hate this vehicle and I can't wait for them to repo it. It's not even worth paying for any more... I am just going to take the hit to my credit and move on amicably. They will just write it off as a loss and sell my debt to a collections agency anyways. I have never in my life been disgusted with a vehicle until now. "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2007,unhappy in GA, 08/09/2009,Pain in the Butt,2,"I bought this car for a franchise that I later sold but kept the car. At 20K miles it needed new brake pads & rotors and again at 40K miles!! The A/C compressor died at 30K. Now, the check engine light is coming on and it is driving very rough. There is only 40K miles on this car, folks! I would never have bought a Chrysler if it was not the car of choice for the franchise I owned at the time and will NEVER buy one again. "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2007,rawhite, 08/14/2009,Still goin!,4,"Presently I have 83,000 miles on my PT Cruiser. I've only had to replace brakes once, tires once and of course numerous oil changes!!! I do a lot of highway driving and get decent mileage, about 25/mpg. Its a joy to drive!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2007,Second time Around, 11/04/2009,Second Time Not As Good,4,"This is my second PT.  The first was an 02.  Both were five speed and got surprisingly good mileage-22/28.  While I like the keyless entry on the 07 but the reliability has not been as good as the 02: I have replaced the AC fan (28000), THE CLUTCH (29000), and the control arms (31000).  When I traded the 02 in on the 07 it had 73000 miles and the only thing I replaced were wheel bearings. The 5 speed is fun to drive addition to providing better acceleration-a common complaint-and better mpg."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2007,Mike, 12/21/2009,I Love This Car!!!,4,"I had a 2006 Chrysler Sebring that was hit and totaled by a drunk driver.  I needed a new car, so I decided on a PT Cruiser.  I have the Touring Edition with a 5-speed manual, and I love it.  Even though it has the 4-cylinder engine, it will get up and go fast.  Love the space, and love the dashboard design.  Gas mileage could be better, but that's more me than the car. I also love the color, Opal Metallic.  Overall, the car is a great ride and versatile too!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2007,Atum, 01/08/2010,Mileage could be better,4,I purchased my cruiser in May 2007 when I transferred form NYC to Ft Lauderdale after I had rented one for my interview and I loved the way it handled and the mileage wasn't bad but it was not as good as other cars of the same category which is a shame considering that this car is really cool looking and handles extremely well. I did not have to change brake pads until I hit 30000 miles in 2010 but then again changing brakes has a lot to do with ones driving not the pads themselves and that's considering I'm a bit of a speed demon :)
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2007,kidsasuke, 06/30/2013,It was so nice at first.....,3,"We bought a used one of these for about $7500. It looked brand new and handled fine, but then the problems started. We had to replace the brakes twice, and the check engine and airbag lights both stayed on. It ended up costing us about $2000 in repairs and is crap for mileage. We calculated it at about 13.9 mpg doing mostly city driving. The handling feels smooth, but the turn radius is pretty cruddy considering its size. We would've been better off buying a Corolla."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2007,Rwiggler, 05/23/2010,OK for what I paid for it.,3,"Bought this one used with low mileage. It has been ok transportation but has had several costly repairs including AC fan at 40,000, fuel injectors at 40,000. We all know about the lack luster gas mileage and performance. It is roomy though and what do you want for $11,000."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2007,Wayne, 08/10/2010,Love it with 2 exceptions,4,"Bought it for looks and cheap transportation. Satisfied with looks and roominess, not with gas mileage. Averaged 27 on a 2100 mile trip, expected much better from a 4 cyl. Also, the horn sticks. Had it repaired while under warranty. Lasted about 3 months - still sticks. Reading other reviews, seems like a inherent problem, but I'll live with it. All things considered, yeah, I'd buy another one."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2007,even13, 10/07/2010,Buy it you'll like it,4,"Bought this car used with 18K miles for my wife, she shops a lot and needed something to haul her ""stuff"" around, I have always liked the body style so it was an easy sell it now has 60k. I find that I enjoy driving the car it handles well, power isn't what you buy one of these for but it had enough to get my first ticket in 30 plus years, my other car is a 2001 mustang go figure, the PT is a great little car for the money fun to drive just wish the mileage was better. I get 23 to 25 mpg  "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2007,uncleralph, 04/04/2011,I will not buy Chrysler products anymore,2,"They might be a decent car when new, but will start to nickle and dime you later.
This could have been a great car if Chrysler had put some effort into making inprovements over the years.
We own a 06' convertible and a 07 touring sedan.
Everytime you turn around it seems you are replacing the front brakes.
My wifes 06' a/c went out at 60,000 miles. Comp. locked up. 
It has a power steering leak since new.
Fuel mileage is poor at best.
My 07' has had the airbag light on for a year now. My a/c is acting up and will cause the car to jerk or load up at idol.
My radiator is starting to leak. I have heard they last 3-4 years.
I like the styling and the removable seats.
I would not buy!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2007,SOFLA, 05/05/2007,Regrets,2,"The mileage is just awful. How could a 4 cyl compact car in '07 get such bad mileage? Shame on you Chrysler. I have under 20K Mi and have been to the dealer 4 times. My PT stalled out on me 2 times! Embarassing for a new car. Check Eng light came on and off regularly, finally it was diagnosed as oxygen sensor. Clear lens on dash developed 2 cracks, A/C made noise when recurculate was turned on and off. All fixed politely by my accomodating dealer, however it is a hassle. I dread long term reliability and would sell right now if not for huge loss. Front seats have stains from water spills? Should have gone for the HHR for the extra 3-4K $. I do not recomend this car  "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2007,TravelNurse, 09/03/2007,Loving It,4,"I love my new Cruiser, its fun to drive, easy on gas, comfortable to drive in. The turning circle is wider than I expected. The drive is smooth.  I have driven in the mountains with this and it acts like a typical 4 cylinder, but has adequate power to make it up the mountains. The a/c is cold - important in Arizona!  The fold down/take out seats are a real plus for carrying things in the back. My daughter does complain that the seating in the rear is not as comfortable as the front.  My husband has bad knees and finds the higher seating very comfortable both to drive as well as getting in and out of the car.  We are very happy with the car and look forward to many years with the new PT."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2007,DAVNAU, 06/26/2007,Fun Convertible - Reliable!,4,"Averaging 23 MPG so far - 19-20 City and 28 highway with the standard engine and 4-speed automatic.  Note: I don't exceed the speed limits and only use the air conditioning on the hottest days. Absolutely no problems so far - everything works as it is supposed to.  Engine performance is fine for me - better than the 2002 Ford Focus with stnadard engine that I was driving, with gas mileage about 2 MPG less than the Focus."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2007,Maureen, 06/30/2007,Fun,4,"I just love my new PT Cruiser!  It's bright red and my husband and I bought some aftermarket chrome to jazz it up more. We put the chrome beltline on it and chrome around the lights and added a wood-look dash/radio control kit.  It is the 2CK option with the leather seats and chrome body side mouldings and chrome wheels. It is beautiful and fun.  I love the way it handles and it has more pickup on the highway than my old 4-cylinder ""Mommy Van""  I get 19 city and 22 hwy mileage.  Not great, but about what I got with my other 4 cylinder van. I can fold down and tumble up the seats to fit two dog crates in it and this weekend I fit an ocean kayak in it!  It does everything I ask of it."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2007,Rob's PT, 09/07/2007,Retirement Cruiser,4,"Always loved this model, but the early models were costly. My 07 4 speed auto was a real bargain. I got the silver base model which i think goes best with the interior colors. Rented one for a few days, while my van was in the shop and fell for this baby! "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2007,Sarah's Dad, 09/18/2007,Great Car,4,This is a great little car. I bought it for my daughter to drive to college. We got a Sin and Sound option package for a low price. My daughter loves the sunroof and the Boston Acoustics stereo. The fit and finish is WAY better than I expected at this price. The 4 cylinder engine is adequate. So far we have had 0 problems
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2007,angee sommers, 11/04/2007,mechanic failures,2,"This viehicle had to have two front transmission seals replaced before it had 2400 miles on it, yes two thousand four hundred miles. This vehicle vibrates at 45mph and while in idle. Very disappointed in vehicle and reliability. Brakes shutter at breaking at high speed, will be a problem at a later date."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2007,tfakehany, 03/04/2008,The Gangsters Helped,4,"Attitude, humor and styling are what this vehicle is all about.  PT Cruiser owners are a cult unto their own. The car is neither too big nor little. The seats are neither too hard nor soft. The engine is neither too powerful or a pussy cat.  Owning a PT Cruiser is an adventure into selfish realism and being an owner of such an AG colored vehicle is youthful, courageous and magnificent.  And that is all I have to say."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2007,dodge6095, 11/03/2007,2 PT Cruiser family,4,"I purchased a 2007 cool vanilla Cruiser base with automatic and cruise control in 09-2007.  Liked the vehicle so much I purchased another cruiser touring edition for my wife.  Both vehicles drive and ride extremely well.  Being senior citizens we enjoy the ease of entering and exiting this vehicle. Gas mileage is 22-23 cith and 26-28 highway.  I drove Fords for forty two years but the PT Cruiser is far better than any Ford I ever owned.  Fun to drive, sits up high, road visability is great and visibility from inside out is good with no blind spots like their is with the HHR.  The PT for the money and value, and reliability with a lifetime warranty can't be beat in my mind.  Very happy with "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2007,pita, 11/03/2007,Fantastic Ride,4,"I purchased a 2007 PT Cruiser vehicle because consumer repots show it to be economy friendly. The driving performance is amazing.  It really holds the road well. I live in the country so most of the roads are 55mph and higher.  The vehicle takes a curve with total smoothness and comfort. I have found nothing that I do not like about the vehicle. I purchased it for price, consumer rateings and gas usage. It is extrmely good on gas. My father has a 2007 expedition and the PT Cruiser feels just as smooth of a ride as his 35,000$ vehicle."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2007,mzurk, 11/05/2007,"I thought i was driving a car, not SUV",3,"Wow! Horrible gas mileage! I seriously thought there was something wrong with it when I got it, but apparently it's in working order. How can I get 14 MPG in town in 4 cyl and only 22-24 highway. Please. I would expect this mileage from a mid to large size SUV not a car. This car needless to say is gone, or on its way out. It's not that the features or styling that I don't like, which I do, but when you're driving 150-300 miles per day, yea filling that puppy up everyday is just putting to many read numbers in quick book for me."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2007,Angel, 12/05/2007,Claustrophobic people shouldnt buy this,3,I got my 2007 PT Crusier from a private car broker after I had got into a car accident in my 2000 Toyota Camry in Feb. Now I'm a tall girl and my head hits the ceiling if I don't have the seats laid back. I am the claustrophobic type & since the ceiling also slants more down in the front that causes a problem for me too. The drive is a little more rough when I compare it to my old Camry. The PT does not have little cubbies like my Camry did and you sit very high up in the car to the point that you think you're driving a truck. The back seats have great head room though but the leg room is quite small. It's December now and I'm trading in my PT. Hopefully tomorrow cause I'm sick of driving it.
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2007,RetroMan, 03/25/2008,Going Home in Style,4,"I was hooked on the style of the PT even before it came out so I guess I was pre-sold. But it took me 6 years to get one since I needed the size my old Mopar van had. Now I have my PT and I love it! Sure, it's a base sedan with just an automatic and A/C but it has all the toys I need and corners sharp and my teen-age grandson thinks its ""cool"". I'm a ""husky"" six-footer who finds the headroom generous and the legroom more than adequate and can reach all the window/stereo/HVAC controls without stretching. Gripes? Well, it could get better mileage but it weighs 3100 lbs (a Z-06 Vette is only 700lbs more!). It reminds me of my old PV544 Volvo: same handy size, same old-time looks, same swagger!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2007,IGGYPOP, 03/29/2008,LOVE IT,4,"Bought a 2007 touring, mars blue color with 23k miles on it (was a rental car), rides great, inside pretty comfy, love the blue dash, fun as heck to drive, 2.4L has good pickup, wish glove compartment locked and had the chilling feature like the Caliber, my gas w/local driving is 14.6-14.9 with no change in 1 month so that is terrible. My dad would have loved the 50's feel!! "
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2007,Doug in Florida, 03/31/2008,Excellent Car,4,"I can't say enough good things about the PT Cruiser.  I drive an '04, and we were so happy with it we purchased my wife an '07.  The car is excellent, a great tradeoff of comfort, utility and economy.  The fold down seats and interior room allow us to carry just about anything we need.  I purchased an 8' countertop at Home depot, folded down the seats pushed the countertop in and closed the hatch.  Mileage not the greatest, but still good.  My wife and I both get about 24 city and 30 - 31 highway.  My 04 has 98,500 miles and has been trouble free.  Daughter's boyfriend just purchased an 08 PT based on what he saw with ours."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2007,huntinchic, 04/14/2008,Could be worse,4,"I have read many previous reviews on the 07 Cruiser, some have been calling this vehicle a ""Compact Car"" and them complaining about the mileage. I have to say that I have the basic model with no cruise control and I get 21 MPG city and that a site better than the 12 MPG I was getting in my 4X4 pickup. It handles great, corner tight. I love my PT Cruiser! My suggestion is, if you think this is a compact car, think again before you buy. PT's are small type SUV's and wagons, the little convertible may be classified as a car but the others are not."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2007,LV, 04/30/2008,Love our PTs!!!,4,"We bought 2 PTs in March '08-a Limited Edition for Mom and a Pacific Coast Highway Edition for our teenager. We both love our new cars! Best feature is the utility of the vehicle--love all the options in the back-absolutely perfect for beach trips, groceries and softball equipment. We have actually gained on the Mpg as we ""broke-in"" the cars (both were brand new at purchase). We love the retro styling, pick-up is just fine; SO FUN TO DRIVE! So much better than those sedans!! Enjoy your ride and long live the PT!!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2007,BTKA, 05/01/2008,So far so good,4,"Just bought our cruiser and have gotten decent mileage.  We are getting 23 mpg in the city and 26 mpg on the hwy.  We traded in a trailblazer that I loved, in return for better gas mileage.  For the price, we really got a good deal.  Just as much seat room, little less in storage, but none the less way better on gas.  We were skeptical of the ""hearse looking car"" at first, but loved this inside so much we bought it.  Talked to another gentleman with a cruiser that had 78,000 mi on it and never had one problem.  Looking forward to many more miles and less gas.  Great buy."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2008,DSchmidt, 10/23/2015,2008 PTCruiser,5,"Milage on mine is 85,000. So far 
Pros:  Stick shift has great pick up and very fun to drive. After 9yrs of driving this car, the seats are still super plump and comfortable and offer plenty of back support. The back seats are very simple to remove so I can haul an amazing amount of stuff. My gas milage seemed to improve substantially after I broke in the engine over time. I've gotten as high as 27mpg hwy and as low as 19. I thought this car was a tin can in the beginning and considered it to be a temporary car for me, but to my surprize...it's really held up pretty well for such an inexpensive car.

Cons: So far I've had to replace the cam shaft, hub bearings, clutch and the fan under hood. Needs the starter replaced or ignition switch...not sure which. Oxidation on roof only. Claying and waxing helped make it look a bit better. I have noticed so many cruisers have this paint failure problem. Not sure if there is a recall on the exterior paint. If there isn't...there should be.

I clayed the exterior and waxed it. I detailed the inside. Took my mother for a ride...she complimented me that it looks brand new inside. It's looks and sounds great! Although I do take very good care of my cars...I think this car is overall a really nice and fun car to drive.

It turns out, Chrysler was sued over this year of car's TIPM. Which, controls all of these things, plus Windows. They never put in a recall, even though your car will randomly stop no matter how fast your going. It's about $1,200 to fix.

The ride quality seems to be decent...very little harshness from wind noise or uneven road surfaces. The interior always evokes positive responses from any passengers that have been in my car...it has this..symmetrical (obviously retro) quality to it.

chrysler,pt-cruiser,2008,momswagon, 06/28/2009,Just the Ticket for Mom,3,"Bought the 2008 PT Cruiser wagon base model used with 15K miles on it.  It had been used as a rental car.  Very clean and still looked new.  The engine light was on when I bought it, but it was all under warranty so I took it to the dealership and they fixed it right up. I added window tint later.  It's been great around town for me,the kids and all of our stuff - we're a busy family and I really enjoy the roominess of the cargo area.  For the dog, I can fold the back seats up for even more room.  The only drawback is the surprising low gas mileage for the base engine, because it's not quick.  We have to use the a/c all the time (which works great), so that's even more engine drag!"
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2008,JW, 08/03/2008,"Boring, boring, boring",2,"Looks good from the outside, but by 2008 is getting dated. The dashboard is sleek, but made of a very cheap plastic. The seats are not comfortable in the slightest for long drives. They are not contoured to the body at all. Not much storage capacity despite being a wagon. The power is pitiful in town and for the highway."
chrysler,pt-cruiser,2008,aggie, 01/09/2009,"Looks nice, runs great, but",3,"The car runs great, handles well, nice and roomy. There is a squeaking noise going over bumps that sounds like it hasn't been lubed. I like it very much. It's versatle and fun to drive. Makes you want to get in it and go cruising except I can't because the headlights randomly flicker. This ranges from mild to severe with severe being when the dash lights flicker too and then they both blip out and then back on again. I've had it to two different dealers who can't find a thing wrong wth it so I guess it must be posessed. I wouldn't buy another one of these. I hope someone can finally fix it so I can enjoy it without worry. "

I've always wanted one and always let my now teenage daughter talk me out of; she left for college & I got my car (Sunset Edition) the color is great and the chrome really sets it off. I do wish the interior plastic molding was better matched and I REALLY miss my cruise control but this car is great. I've got a 2 yr old and with this car she can see out from her car seat, with my cobalt my 7 yr old nephew couldn't see out. To me the seats are more like the truck I used to drive than a car & I love the way the seats fold and remove; comes in handy with our frequent auctions and yard sales! In ending this one was worth waiting for. I love the dash board clock & emblems."

Do you think it's been a joy? Not one bit! I have had nothing but problems since day one! It has been in for balancing over 3 times, the tires have been indexed multiple times, and now it squeaks when I go over anything that makes the car bouce. It's so annoying!

Not only that but it's so easy to park! The handy lift gate and fold away seats allow my Rottweiler to come along! It's roomier than it looks it's an eye catcher. I don't care if it's a little bit harder on the gas than some - it's far better than the SUV I just unloaded and it's way funner to drive. It works for me :)

Even though it was December and we are in the North the car handles great on the snow. The gears are a little closer in range than her Hyundai and the shifter has a better action.  The car handles great even though it is a little porky and we like to hustle the car.  The fuel economy could be better as we are getting about 26 mpg right now.

I think the dash does not equal the rest of the car, its cheap looking. I'm planning on purchasing the wood dash kit (it sounds easy to install...we'll see).

But truck prices were too high so eventually I looked at and drove the PT.  I liked it.  Good visablity, comfortable seats, roomy interior, lots of cargo space, seems to be well made. Suspension is firm but not harsh, cabin is pretty darn quiet, might even be quieter then my Crown Vic.  It has the electronic mileage readout and in town looks to run around 19 mpg and in mixed commuting type driving about 23 mpg.  Engine power is adequate."

Its seating is deceiving. It is actually rather difficult to get into and out of if you are big and tall (6'3"" 250). The seats are very short and make for uncomfortable long distance driving. I would like to trade in on a used truck; but - value dropped $9,000.00 in less than two months. Kelly Blue Book and N.A.D.A. rate the value used at $10,000 to $12,500.

I paid under 13K for a car stickered at $19995! (try buying a stripped HHR or Kia Soul for that!). I looked at a lot of cars and NOTHING came close to the bang for the buck that the PT has.

I drove two foreign cars and they didn't drive as nice and quiet as the pt cruiser. This car has an American car feel, nice and solid.

have had to wait for 10 months to get 
one.  The Dodge dealership even told me 
there shoudl have been a recall on the 
transmission.  I've had many brake 
problems, and my tires, which are brand 
new, already need replaced.  Everytime 
I take it in for an oil change they

I am maticulous with the exterior (looks new) but have been battling rust that is coming from the inside of the hood leaching out.

Had timing belt, coolant flush,New muffler, I don't remember what else. After having a bunch of things fixed, I still have problems with car starting. Takes 3-5 tries before car starts. Mechanic cannot figure out what is causing it. Engine light stays on because of cylindar 1 misfire. All cylinders have been cleaned, and still get that code show up when engine light is on. Car doesn't run different. Was suggested o2 sensors but those are impossible to find. I suggest wording parts for that car at amautopart.com. cheaper!

to drive. We've had a little problem 
with tire and brake wear and when 
seemingly small things go wrong, they 
are quite expensive to repair; seems 
you can't just fix the broken part, you 
have to buy the whole assemblies, like

60K. My dealership service has been 
EXCELLENT."

with the top down. When the top is up, 
it seems kind of little inside. I am a

extremely comfortable, reliable, and 
great looking to boot! It's ride is 
smooth and controlled. I think the 
interior materials could look a little 
better, but they do their job, and 
that's what counts. It's steering is 
great, easy to drive. It may not be the 
most powerful car out there, but it has 
plenty of power on tap. The interior 
could be quieter, because even for a 
convertible it's somewhat noisy. But 
with the top down, wind buffeting is 
minimal. Conversation is kept at normal 
tone, even on the interstate doing 75

BMW's, and camaros...none of them make 
me as content as my sebring. 
Everything in the interior is 
perfectly placed. The outside is eye 
catching, especially the chrome 
wheels. The two-toned leather is a 
very rare feature on any vehicle. The 
interior looks just as sharp as the 
exterior when the top is down. While a 
beamer or benz would be much more

well under what I had expected. 
Recently, I replaced a bent rim...and 
I am constantly swerving from 
potholes. The transmission shifts in 
and out of overdrive for some reason, 
and takes a hell of a lot of time to 
get into overdrive on cold mornings 
(the dealership says that both 
are ""normal conditions""). The front 
end of this car drags on anything, so 
if you buy one, be sure to keep your 
distance from parking blocks. My next 
car will definately not be a Chrysler,

only had it for about 3 months now but 
I could not have asked for more in a 
car for the price. If you are worried 
about appearance, this is a super-sexy 
car. I've read several reviews 
complaining about the wheels bending 
easily, but luckily, mine came with 
after-market wheels off the used car

for days to put that top down.  I have received 
compliments on how good it looks since the day I 
bought it.  I will get rid of my SUV way before I get 
rid of my Sebring!  The only problems I have had

was new.  Very few problems with the 
car, all were minor.  Still no leaks.  
The trunk is great for a convertible 
and the back seats actually are 
comfortable.  I keep thinking about a 
new car, but can't bring myself to get 
rid of it.  On the downside, it could 
use a few more horses, but the car is 
very reliable.  The top is still in 
great sheape.  It still turns heads!"
chrysler,sebring,2000,Chrysler guy, 12/12/2004,Still love this car!,4,"Was reading some other reviews and thought I'd put my two cents' worth in: Bought my Sebring new in May, 2000, and for the first 3 years only had put about 33,000 miles on it, using it every day but for a mostly local lifestyle.  Then I moved about 20 months ago and have been commuting about 100 miles a day since then.  My mileage is up to 73000+, and the car is holding up just great!  I still love the exterior body style and stance of the car; the original top is in perfect condition; the car never has leaked; and has needed NO repairs beyond routine maintenance except for having to replace the front brake rotors, which warped due to my putting brake dust shields on the wheels. "
chrysler,sebring,2000,Gerry Stanford, 07/19/2006,Mid Life Chrysler,3,"This car has been an absolute joy to own until recently. The car has performed flawlessly until it hit 90k miles. Engine has enough pep to propel me in and out of tight spots including taking my bass boat to the lake. However, when the car hits 90K the durability factor goes out the window. Plan on a trade in of about 4k or spend the same in keeping it running. AC alone will cost me $2K to repair. "

I am very particular, changed the oil and filters religously. The car looks and runs like it just came off the showroom floor. I have changed the brakes and rotors, battery, serviced the trans and cooling system, basic maintenance you expect to keep a car purring. The only problem I had was the sensor on the trans failed which was under warranty. The wires connecting the rear defroster failed several times, so I gave up on that. The sun visor clips broke several times, no big deal inexpensive items to replace and change out easily. The sound system is excellent for stock. Love my car. I recommend."

rewired, tuned up, and the transmission

I learned through Internet research the 2.7 L V6 engine in this car was known for developing oil sludge, coolant leaks, catastrophic failure due to poor design.  At 67,000 miles, I've replaced water pump, water inlet housing, and still have coolant leaking into the engine. I'm guessing it's the gaskets."

However having recently sold a wonderful Saab 9-3 Convertible I decided to give a used Sebring Convertible a try. Although the build quality might not be quite up to Saab standards, it is very acceptable for this price point in the market. The LXi sold for approx. $28,000 new as opposed to nearly $43,000 for the Saab.
What it may lack in build quality it makes up for with better structural rigidity, a smooth ride and smooth V6. (Just be sure to maintain the engine religiously) The most pleasant surprise is the exceptional gas mileage, and the roominess also desrves mention."

chrysler,sebring,2001,warrenza, 03/07/2002,fun to drive,4,"This car is fun to drive...especially when the weather is nice and the top is down.  You'll also get plenty of compliments.  Fuel economy is quite good (I avg. 27.1 mpg), the seating is ample for four adults and the ride is quite good but could be smoother on the bumpier roads.  Only complaint here is that in the one year I have owned the car, I have had to return to the dealer on three occasions to repair 6 minor items.  The quality control needs improvement."
chrysler,sebring,2001,basebalcch, 02/23/2006,Transmission,2,"Transmissions are known to go after 80,000 miles. Of course they don't volunteer this information until it goes out. Unfortunately the extended warranty that was supposedly good until 2009 or 80,000 miles which ever came first wasn't good for anything. I was faced with a 3000 to 5000 dollar repair or leave the car sitting while I continue to make payments. Don't ever buy a pre-owned or used Chrysler SeBring. I am VERY Disapointed!"
chrysler,sebring,2001,Marilyn W, 07/15/2010,Worst Car I Ever Owned,3,"Bought car in 2004 with less than 12,000 miles - had problems ever since - I drive less than 50 miles per month. Power windows broken and replaced; fumes inside car when starting; ac/heater only works on high; alternator being replaced now; waiting for entire engine to go - I love the look of this car but it is not worth all the repair bills. Now engine making ""funny noise"" - I hope it isn't expensive to fix - on disability and can't afford it anymore. Chrysler should be ashamed especially since they took tax payer money for bailout. Bet they have no car problems, will never ever have another Chrysler product."
chrysler,sebring,2001,doxen, 09/15/2010,Used car should have kept,4,"We bought this for our son in the military. We liked the looks and it was reasonable had 95k miles. We took it in to AAA garage and they only put in a new timing belt and changed the radiator fluid for a cold climate. I drove it from Phoenix to east coast and ran great. It was also more comfortable than making the same drive in a town car or suburban. The mechanics said should be good for another 1999999 miles, We liked looks so much we are now looking at other sebrings for us. Have owned chrysler lebaron Triumph (biggest disaster) chevy hondas. This ranks in the best."
chrysler,sebring,2001,very dissapointed, 12/16/2003,I hate this car,3,"My first problem was that the dashboard 
would not illuminate at night.  After 
that an anti-lock brake sensor went out 
followed by a broken brake pad.  After 
that the door would lock itself when I 
tried to open it from the outside.  
That took 8-9 trips to the dealer to be 
repaired.  I have had the cd player 
replaced and the drivers side speaker 
replaced two times.  I have had to have 
my drivers side window replaced because 
it would no longer function.  My latest 
pproblem is a transmission fluid leak 
and my car only has 20000 mile on it!"
chrysler,sebring,2001,Marquis Johnson, 11/04/2005,Life Saver,5,"I got my sebring for a birthday present and I loved the performance right off the bat.  But the safeness of this car is astonishing.  Yesterday, I was hit by a mack truck in the sebring.  the car flipped three times, then slid 50 on the driver's side.  eventually, the car rolled again and landed on all fours.  After all of this, i got out of the car without a scratch.  The door even opened with no problem.  This is a really well built car, and i would reccomend it to anyone.  It also has amazing power.  Lots of torque to get you off the line.  I had the 6 cylinder engine.  Amazing Car!!!!!!!!"
chrysler,sebring,2001,Debbie, 12/11/2005,Very Disappointed,2,"I've owned my car for a little over 2 1/2 years.  Last summer Chrysler had to put a new engine in it.  3 months later the bushings had to be replaced.  I'm lucky it was still under warranty.  Now the car just won't start.  I was stranded at the store, called AAA and had to leave it in the parking lot.  Going to get  rid  of it asap.  I have to get it running first.  Bad thing is I still have another year to pay on it.  I will not purchase another Chrysler."

chrysler,sebring,2001,MissShona, 05/25/2008,"Wow, What A Surpise",4,"A couple of weeks ago I brought a '01 Sebring LX.  I was on a tight budget but I still wanted a ""cool"" car.  I never knew a Chrysler would fit the bill!  Although I have an LX, it has the V-6 engine.  This is my first automatic car but it's so peppy I almost don't miss shifting.  Passing and acceleration are no problem.  It's comfortable on long road trips.  It looks amazing for a 7 year old car.  I was considering the Mitsubishi Eclipse from around the same years and this car was thousands cheaper than the Mitsubishi Eclipse GT (but with the same engine).  The exterior looks very classy too."
chrysler,sebring,2001,Joe from Grand Rapids, MI,2001 Chrysler Sebring Convertible,5,"I purchased a 2001 Sebring Convertible Limited with 65,000 on an eBay auction in July 2007. The seller claimed that the car ran fine and the only problem was the rear window defroster didn't work. I did encounter a ""check engine"" light that came on within a day of the purchase. Had it taken to a Chrysler dealer and the problem was the venting hoses from the fuel tank were bad. The tank was dropped and new hoses installed. I also asked the dealership to look it over for any other area of concern while it was up on the hoist. They said that the transmission fluid and coolant should be changed. All of these items were done! It is now 2019, and the car looks better today than the day I purchased it. Other than a new battery in 2011 and new Michellin tires in 2013, along with regular fluid changes, the car has had NO issues. I did get the rear defogger repaired, it was just the window connector that need to be re-attached. This auto had never been in the snow during winters before I purchased it and I continued that tradition. Now 18 years old and only driven in summers, this car drives like new and everything works perfectly! 
I know that there are many Sebrings that turned out to be ""lemons"", but I got a really nice one and I plan to keep it for years to come!
"
chrysler,sebring,2001,jlanier, 08/07/2010,Not bad but could be better,3,"I bought this car from a used car dealership. It looks great and drives well. The suspension is sub-par. have had problems with the shocks/struts, ball joints. However, the engine runs terrific and gets great gas mileage. "
chrysler,sebring,2001,michael c, 06/28/2008,Surprise Surprise,4,"The circumstances I got my Sebring in is another story, but it wasn't my initial choice. I was skeptical of Chryslers having owned a Neon that was a turd. But it turns out it's just a Mitsubishi Eclipse in a Sebring body! It has been a great car. I do regular maintenance myself, and have used premium fuel and synthetic oil since the first change. It runs as strong with 7 yrs and 83,000 miles as it did with 10 days and 100."
chrysler,sebring,2001,larry, 07/14/2008,I'll keep it,4,"Wife bought the car on impulse: now an all-time fave. This car runs smooth as silk w/ 48,000 mi on it. Its quick and very agile. Had to change out ball joints and other front-end stuff at great expense, but after driving new Saab, Audi and MB convertibles, decided the differences weren't worth $40,000! I'll keep it!"
chrysler,sebring,2001,VirginiaD, 10/17/2009,Loved it but it was a lemon,4,"My first convertible, and a great one at that. Power top was perfect and never had problems with it working. Replaced top seal when I purchased it ($800), replaced rotors (on all my Chryslers) every 20k miles. Brakes were not strong. Engine began to smoke at about 45k, and mechanics said it was a goner. NOT a good investment. Engine is a bad one (2.7L V6). Loved the car and top down driving and very comfortable, with all the nice options. Peppy to drive and smooth on hwy. Can't recommend because of engines and overall long-term quality issues. "
chrysler,sebring,2001,not at all satisfied, 09/17/2002,Not Happy with 2nd new Car,3,"On 01/02 I purchased a brand new 
Sebring convertible.  Has probelms with 
the heat, not to mention other thins, 
from the moment I drove it off of the 
lot.  I then arbitrated it under the 
lemon law and won.  I then got aanother 
convertible built just for me in the 
factory.  I had less than 5,000 miles 
on and I was driving on the highway 
when I blew a head gasket.  They had to 
replace the engine.  Now I am stuck 
with a car I don't even want to get in 
to every day."
chrysler,sebring,2001,sjs1, 12/16/2002,small problems ad up,3,"The rear window defroster detaches when 
lowering the convertible top.  Warrenty 
work by authorized Chrysler dealers is 
poor. Replacing the rear window 
everytime the defroster detaches has 
gotten old - fast.  The roof also 
rattles."
chrysler,sebring,2001,Topless in Ga., 07/22/2003,Wish I had passed on buying,3,"This is the worst car I have ever 
owned,The car is fun to drive and the 
looks are sharp.The major gripe I have 
is the fact it has been in the shop 9 
different times. Minor being the 
peeling of the steering wheel center 
cover to major the AC not working 
anything else in between also. Two many 
noises have popped up suddenly.This is 
my wifes daily driver and the two 
reasons I still have it is she loves 
the conv. that is why I bought it for 
her and second is the trade in and 
resale is awful. I think I got a LEMON."
chrysler,sebring,2001,freeohio, 11/07/2003,Still love it,4,"I have had my car for 2 years and 5 
months and I still love it.  Overall I 
have been very satisfied with my car.  
I had to have the stereo replaced when 
the car was a year old, but the dealer 
was fast and courteous about replacing 
it.  The only things I have a problem 
with is the cupholder location, (I 
accidentally turn the cd player on 
when I use the cupholder!) And the 
front seats are hard to move for 
people getting in and out of the back 
seat.  Other than that I still love it 
2 years later!"
chrysler,sebring,2001,2001LXiVert, 09/13/2005,Great mix of fun / practicality,4,"This is the best car I've ever owned.  I bought it new with 2 miles on it in March of 2001 and have never had any major mechanical problems with it.  Very comfortable and stylish, plus great for a family car.  200 hp performs very well in a heavy convertible, plus >30 highway mileage.  City mileage suffers some, but still >20 even on the bad days.  I bought this car because the 2001 was the first year to offer the 2.7l V6 and better styling than the previous Sebrings."
chrysler,sebring,2001,quefa10, 07/08/2004,Great Car,4,"This is my second Chyrsler convertible.  
I can describe the car in two words.  
Comfortable & sophiscated.  If the 
reliability is there (will be proved out 
by time)...I can see why Chrysler builds 
so many of them. I purchased it with 23,
000 miles on the oddometer."
chrysler,sebring,2001,peter128, 09/04/2004,Makes a better paper weight,2,"Before I had my first 500 miles on the 
car, I had to bring it back to the 
dealer for a whining engine sound, 
which was the first of many visits.  I 
am frustrated with the poor quality 
construction. I know have 45K on the 
car and I need a new transmission.  
This will be my last chrysler ever. 
The car looks great, as long as it's 
not moving."
chrysler,sebring,2001,stevio, 09/07/2004,Good for a non-sport enthusiast,3,"Overall, it's been a good ride.  I had  
2000 JXI which I was actually MORE 
happy with than this one.  However, it 
was wrecked.
  I've had very rough idle engine 
problems since 12k miles.  Dealer 
claims to have finally fixed it on the 
3rd visit.  But, still runs rough from 
time to time.

Very impressive mileage for a v-6 in 
such a big car.  I get 30-31 on highway 
with non-ethanol gas with speeds less 
than 73.  After 73, mileage really 
deteriorates.  (Just imagine if I 
didn't have that rough idle?)

I would NOT buy another.  However, 
would buy a used 1999 or 2000 JXI if 
the price was right."
chrysler,sebring,2001,topdownalways, 04/08/2003,Enjoyable Ride,4,"Fun ride with decent gas milage.  I've 
driven other LXi rental convertables 
and have seen a difference on 
performance.  Some, like mine, have a 
lag when stepping on the gas and 
accelerating (which is critical for the 
split second pass).  Once it does kick 
in, there is a jerk and quick 
acceleration.  Sound system is great, 
seating room is great, trunk space is 
good (better than most convertables), 
love the car design and that you can be 
moving and still open/close the top.  I 
have had the car for two years.  I have 
had the window motor, the electrical 
light panel controler, and wheel 
bearings replaced at 36,000 miles."
chrysler,sebring,2001,CABolland, 06/01/2003,what fun it is to drive!!,4,"It is sporty, lots of room for back 
seat passengers - fun to drive.  One 
drawback - we had to have the seals 
replaced around the windows as they 
leaked after it rained.  Dealer was 
very cooperative!!"
chrysler,sebring,2001,LtdOwner, 03/21/2002,10 Month Review,4,"Only one problem: extremely high wind noise with the top up. A low roaring wind noise comes through the top front and a whistling noise from around the windows. Sounds like you're at the airport watching jets take off! Loud wind noise is due to poor seal with the top front clips and the rubber seals around the windows not sealing tightly. Dealership adjusted windows and the top front clips which greatly reduced the noise but it came came back after a few days of driving. It's actually quieter driving with the top down!

Before you buy take it down the freeway with the top and windows up to make sure yours doesn't also sound like you're in a wind tunnel."
chrysler,sebring,2001,s riley, 04/24/2008,Great car,4,I have had this car for 6 years now.  Absolutely love it. Can't fault it.  No major costs incurred and good mileage considering its over 6 years old now.  I live in Erie PA where we get LOTS of snow.  Car handles the slippery roads well. I hope to have it for many more years!  Possibly forever - I would hate to part with it. 
chrysler,sebring,2001,Chrysi, 10/02/2010,Still Love MIne!,4,"I bought my Chrysler Conv used w 10k miles an I now have 62K. I use it every day! Yes I have had some minor issues and most under warranty but she  purrs like a kitten. I drive every day to and from work and on trips get 31 mpg. In town 21 or 22. Used the dealer under warranty and now have honest mechanic. Replaced brakes twice because i am hard on brakes, seal went on transmission, no biggie. Drives Great, Looks great, Inside looks brand new. Have to do regular maintenance."
chrysler,sebring,2001,Drip drip Drip, 12/03/2006,Drip drip Drip,3,"The car looks good, is fun to drive, and has a good heart (engine).  However, it squeaks and creaks and loves to drip oil everywhere.  Frankly, a car built in 2001 shouldn't have such poor suspension and oil retention.  Overall, I cannot recommend this car because part of the driving experience is not hearing squeaks and creaks when traveling over the slightest of bumps and not continually staining your garage floor with engine oil.  In the future I will be more leery of Chrysler's products.  Do your research before you buy."
chrysler,sebring,2001,Jennifer, 10/15/2007,Do NOT buy this car,2,"I have had nothing but trouble with this car. Since I bought this car I have had to replace the wheel bearings on the drivers side, The HVAC unit went out, the key was stuck in the ignition and could not be removed until removed by a mechanic, Motor for the Air conditioning went, Not to mention the awful oil leak that it has and has been fixed twice. The car is now in the shop for something else to be repaired. I was warned about this engine that was put into this car and I did not listen. Keep in mind that all of this stuff that needed to be replaced was only in a three year period. This car has made up my mind about Chrysler cars. Never will I buy another one."
chrysler,sebring,2001,Ken T, 07/08/2010,"Very fine, smooth, eye-catcher",4,"One of the finest, most subtle, smooth, solid, quality rides I've ever had the pleasure of owning & driving (& I've had alot!). Excellent power (3.0 L, 24v, Mitsu engine with 5-spd), handling, & stopping ability.  All without alot of hot rod/dog noise & flash; just a fine tune from the (unfortunately single) exhaust & from the engine.  Yet due to power2weight, I get 23-27 mpg driving in the fast lane. (K&N filter, Z-Max, airflow director, Vavoline Durablend, & +1 Toyo Z-rated's help)  Have run it at both Laguna Sega & Infinion raceways with grand style, good times much fun!

The car had been leased andhad 28,000 miles on it.  Had issues from the start, the same thing would break over and over (blower for the fan for heat/AC, rear defrost, airbag light).  I can't go 5 months without taking it to the shop (form day 1).  Got a new transmission as well.  Now it has 175,000 on it, and it still starts up right away, but the airbag light is on again.  Car left me stranded twice cause it blew fuses because of crazy wiring.  Roof leaks only on the driver's side in 2 places.  Fun to drive.  Motors for the top are still fine.  But not a quality, reliable car. "

At first changes added; K&N filter, Z- Max & 245x45 Toyo's. Been absolutely rock-solid reliable & that's even after hot laps around Sears Point & Laguna Seca!  What a rush. Only complaints are a bit too much wind noise, limited rear quarter vision, & power mirrors lost power. Oil, belts, brakes, & tires are only money I've had to put in. At 75,000 miles. No major maintenance until I reach 90,000 miles + 100,000 warranty to boot! Great!"
chrysler,sebring,2001,Matt, 07/19/2009,Steer clear of the Sebring,3,"I just recently got my lisence last summer and this was my first car. At first glance you would say its a nice looking car but looks don't count for everything. When i got it, it has about 114,000 miles on it. The transmission had been replaced along with a power steering pump. I thought that this car would last me for a few years but after having the car for one day the fuel pump gave out. Shortly after the ac went bad along with the back two windows. When winter hit the car struggled to start and the thermostat went bad making it very difficult to drive. Also because of it's low power and heavy body, it made it slmost impossible to drive in the winter."
chrysler,sebring,2001,T.S., 10/05/2009,What A Fun Cae,4,"Bought this convertible for a fun summer car. Was able to get this well maintained from a private party in Fl. who always garaged the auto. Drove it 1,200 miles non stop returning to home. Is as comfortable as my '08 Cadillac CTS and I am 6' 200 lbs. Have enjoyed everything about it this summer without one squeak. My '06 Honda Pilot has two squeaks I can't fix. Another week or two to use before it gets stored for the winter. Absolutely love this car and I will keep it for many years."

I purchased the car as a left over in January 2002.  My Gripe: I was misled about signing a disclosure that he was explained that the paint was not covered by warranty against chips & scratches. Duh... he replied that people sue over anything.  Little did I know they used an experimental ""environmentally friendly"" paint,if I knew I wouldn't have signed.  After about 3 years the clear coat started pulling up from the paint which made my black car have white blotches all over, the clear coat began falling off and I have no recourse. Deception"

chrysler,sebring,2001,Hoovey, 10/10/2005,Don't count on it . . . or Chrysler,3,"This is my first Chrysler, and it will certainly be my last.  Don't get me wrong - I love the looks of the car, but looks sure aren't everything.  I have had problems with my Sebring since I purchased it.  First it was the engine.  No one ever seemed to be able to find the problem when the engine light came on every 4-6 months.  Now it's the paint job, which is fading fast on the top and trunk.  Don't expect any help from Chrysler either.  Under warranty or not, the problems are yours to fix and worry about.  For a company that relies on customers, their customer service is anything but.  Take my advice (as I wish I had taken from others before I bought this car) - don't buy a Chrysler!"
chrysler,sebring,2001,TopDownFun, 01/08/2006,Perfect choice!!,4,I had searched for quite a while looking for the right size convertible that would be used as a primary driver. The other brands did not have the room or options that the Sebring did. After the first test drive I was in love Almost coming up on two years now with 56K miles owning this car I have yet to have any maintainence problems. Or for that fact anything to complain about. It was the right choice for the right price. Thumbs up to Chrysler for a great product!!

many recurring problems.  I would not

Under that steel hood lies its glass jaw - The Engine. Mine is toast after 50,000 miles. (Coincidentally it was just paid off 2 weeks ago) This was a maintained vehicle that averaged 10,000 mi/yr, mostly highway & light usage. BTW I've already had this thing in the shop on numerous occasions to the tune of over $3000 in repairs which they obviously never got right. Don't let the slick packaging fool you, as you can see by the other comments- Sebring=Bad car buy!

chrysler,sebring,2001,bison, 01/04/2005,Good Look but poor suspension,3,I purchased my convertible new and enjoy driving it with the top down but it needs better suspension for bumpy roads. The engine is quiet but having a convertible makes it noisy. I have had some leaking from the top and rear defroster not working. I have 35000 miles and it has been reliable. But I am disappointed of the poor resale value of these vehicles.  Chysler has a good visual look but in- town ride is rough.

Only with the Seabring Limited. I love the car as much today as the day i bought it. I have the blue with the white leather interior and it catches peoples attention wherever we are. It's a great car for me to unwind from work to home and now that my twins are older they love to take a cruise in it too. 
chrysler,sebring,2001,R.B., 09/25/2006,Best Value Convertible ?,4,"I've had my car for over a year and in addition to providing me with great summer entertainment, it performed formidably throughout a full Canadian winter. The car is beautiful, fairly economical, and the acceleration is smooth and quick. The single largest problem that this car has is body shake. It becomes especially noticeable when the top gets thoroughly wet. If the 2007 Hard Top will address these issues, I might re-think buying the convertible Solara. "

Since the 2-year mark, have had to replace the following: wheel bearings, radio, A/C blower, sway bar links, tie rods, upper control arm, transmission control module, fuel system serviced several times, transmission leak fixed twice, now needs O-rings & fuel rail, which is unacceptable on a car with such few miles on it. I'm starting to believe what I hear about the Chrysler 2.7l V6. Getting rid of this piece of trash as soon as I can."

Car shakes terribly but dealer says its a convertible and you can expect cowl shake. Better than a vibrator. Had the car a little over 5 years and I'd be ashamed to sell it to anyone other than another Chrysler dealership so they would have the problem. Probably cured me from buying another Chrysler product and Ive always been a Chrysler person.Been trying off and on for 3 years to get the whining fixed with no luck at all. Number one piece of JUNK"

I kept driving and now have 170,000 miles on my car.  The only reason I'm trading in is all the replacement parts are starting to go bad and I can't live without air conditioning in the summer.  I wish they still made this car because I'd buy another in a heart beat.  There is nothing like slouching down in the seat and punching the gas.  Lots of fun."

Beautiful design. I honestly don't know why they stopped building it. Really looks and feels like a much more expensive car. The convertible top is still in good shape and that's after ten winters sitting with only a cloth cover. Fun car with a lot of power and still gets about 23 MPH. I highly recommend/

Since day one i had problems.
Heater went out and windows would freeze up and would only blow cold air,
The headlights would flicker on and off, the cd changer when in the cold would make some robotic squeal and change the cds at random.
clock would die out.
The car would not start half the time and the other half id be driving and the oil temperature would skyrocket into overheating.
Twice on the highway my car would almost catch fire.
my ball-join broke off the car and had to get towed going 12mph.
and last but not least, the 2.7 engine died on me at 80k.
all this happend in a span of 8 months.

Bought it below PP price from a dealer (5.5k). It ran great and was reliable till the time i broke it... wasn't the same after repairs. Sold it off 4 months back. The car is quite powerful. 200HP in a light car is not gonna be slow. The Daimler Influences are evident because this ""American"" car is a decent handler. The 4 speed gear box isn't great but it does let you slam the accelerator and use the full RPM range before it shifts. The car looks great and the drop top is nice for the 3 months in a year that it can be put down. I liked the noises the engine made as well."

I sacrificed my new system in my Neon for the Chrysler premium audio system, it sounds good, but will definitely be replaced in the future. One thing I wish the Sebring had was a CD player, it's available with the higher end models or extra option. Drives great, love the V6, has balls. Wind noise at interstate speeds is minimal unless there is strong wind outside, then its a little louder, but can be fixed with extra stripping around the front and rear window junctions. I drove it from my hometown to Denver the day I purchased it, and it was superb. The gas mileage was comparable to my Neon."

chrysler,sebring,2001,MadinDetroit, 03/13/2008,Never Another Chrysler,3,"Before I bought this car I was warned that Chrysler's have a hard time in cold weather. Now at 100,000 I can attest to the fact that those cold morning startups are getting progressively worse  by the season. I believe the blower motor is also dying, it squeals very loudly on the first startup of the day. Sounds like the belts are going bad, and the brakes and struts have failed on all 4 corners. The seats are very uncomfortable. The design is also a bit awkward as it is very difficult to see traffic lights from the front seats when at rest. Fuel mileage should be better for it to be such a ""regular"" car. And the trans failed at 99,000 miles."

Still, it's very comfortable, handles well, gets decent gas mileage, and it's paid for. Guess that's why I still drive it"
chrysler,sebring,2001,Mark, 11/23/2008,Very Good Car,4,"Car rides and handles quite well. Comfortable for long trips. Looks pretty good with some decent quality to the interior materials, not full of cheap plastic. Very good stereo. Have had no real problems with it, so very reliable. Much better in that regard than my 2004 Hyundai Accent, or 90's model Ford cars.  On the downside the fuel mileage isn't great. The visibility and maneuverability are somewhat lacking but I'm used to compact cars. This is a bit of a boat. Windshield defrost takes forever, very ill conceived big center vent in the dash. Low ground clearance. Only a four speed automatic, should be five or six gears. Overall pretty happy."

Problems I have had with it over the years are: At 23K transmission had issues, but they re-built it under warranty and I haven't had an issue since.  Wheel bearings went once at around 65K.  Air conditioning goes on and off at random which I'm told is a control pannel issue.  I have had multiple heat resisters replaced which is a well known issue for this car.  I also have chrome wheels which is the most pain as they lose air constantly.  The engine light stays on from a bad gas cap sensor.  Oil light comes on at stops after long drives, but does not appear to be serious. Despite issues, I still feel it is reliable"

to the dealer 8 times for problems with 
acceleration associated with the new 
transmission.  I have had to have the 
multi-function switch (turn signal) 
replaced, twice.  I have also had to 
have the car checked out for clunking 
noises when I turn, stop, or am at a 
red light.  Chrysler says that these 
are all characteristics of the car, 
therefore they are not responsible to 
repair them, even though they notice 
the same sounds and feelings as I do.

only had a couple, and had to have

Other than that, everything has seemed to go well.  Something did explode in my rear view mirror perhaps related to the heat in Houston and the rear view dimmer feature.

We were originally planning on driving it until my son could drive but I don't think this lemon will hold out. I also don't want to put my son in a car that we can't depend on.  It's bushings are bad, the interior dash light rarely works, it is leaking oil, the inside ""chrome"" looking handles is flaking off, the leather on the steering wheel is gone, excessive brake dust on front.You get the picture. Junk!  Too bad we bought the loaded version - what a waste of money."

chrysler,sebring,2001,joema, 10/18/2007,"Fun to Drive, when it is working",3,"I am ready to trade in this car after achieving 95000 miles; a small miracle in my opinion. I've had electrical problems, water leak problems and AC problems.  However, when the stars align (and the cogs as well), this car is a blast to drive. The V6 has incredible pick-up and responsiveness. It hugs the road and is a real experience to drive. There is plenty of room in the car and the 60/40 feature is a plus. The trunk is just ok. If you get one of these, I recommend you do so only if you have a mechanic that you trust.  My dealer was a loser and thus, I will take it out on Chrysler. This will be the last Chrysler product I buy until they completely overhaul their quality."

steering gear twice, the key cylinder 
once, and just got done replacing the 
front wheel bearings - all before 
28000 miles. The front driver's seat 
has been loose since purchase and 
the 2nd dealership I've tried is 
actually going to repair it . If I had to 
do it over again I wouldn't have 
purchased this vehicle.  I am

16,500 total in the last 8 months) and

the Preimium Sound System.  That makes 
for a nice ride.  It was purchased as 
the family car, replacing a 97 
Cavalier.  Its bigger, but not too 
big.  The ride is very comfy and 
smooth.  The car is good for the cruise 
on the open highway, or the stop and go 
of city traffic.  With the 2.7, its got 
great power to get up and go (keep in 
mind the Cav had a 2.2 4 banger so 
almost anything is an imporvement.)  
Very good looking car.  I stay mainly 
with Chevrolet but this looks better

But, my car has been in the shop far too much and I don't think I can take it anymore. I think it's ridiculous that with 112k miles the engine is going.  I heard from a mechanic that these engines stink so I wouldn't suggest this vehicle.    "
chrysler,sebring,2001,_Jerry_, 04/17/2008,I love it!,4,"Bought it at 116,000 miles from a used auto place down the road for 6,000. Even thought it's the lx, it was loaded. 2.7 v6, 4 disc cd changer (which I took out). I looked at some other models and this one is the only one that appealed to me. Light colored dash, cloth seats, wood grain (although semi- cheap looking) and of course 200 hp. I change the oil myself every 2500 miles with castrol gtx high mileage 5w30 and use Fram oil filters. I've had it for a year and it's now up to 153,000 miles. Today, I took off the valve cover and absolutely no oil sludge. AT ALL! I'm not going to say all the 2.7's are great but I sure do know this one is! Great Car."
chrysler,sebring,2001,Raven, 02/15/2020,Engine - 10,2,"At 123,000 miles the engine on my 2001 LXi blew.  It was replaced along with the rad and a few other parts.  I've replaced the suspension front and back, replaced all of the roof seals and will have to replace the bottom door seals.  The canvass roof will have to be replaced next year.  The canvas is in great shape it's the stitching that's failing.  Rust appeared under the plastic leading edging along the rear side windows.  At this point I've spent as much to keep the car on the road as it cost me to purchase it.  I bought it at the end of a lease period, not mine.  It looked great.  It's a great car to drive, it looks like a mini-Ferrari which is the reason I've done everything I can to keep it on the road.  It now has about 136,000 miles on it presently (Feb. 2020)  It's attended cars and parades receiving many admiring compliments.  I guess I'll keep it.

My Sebring was purchased with 140,000 miles on it, and from what I noticed, the previous owner took GOOD CARE OF IT. Obviously if you neglect your car, run it to the ground, and forget to change the oil on time, sludge will become a harsh reality. Timing belt or chain? No issues here. This car is very underrated, and I think more people need to report the positives on this car, such as, the sharp style of the body, the actual quality of the 2.7 liter engine, and the interior build quality. I use Mobile 1 extended performance synthetic motor oil. I love my Sebring. "
chrysler,sebring,2002,Dale, 08/15/2010,Preventive Maintenance when buying used.,4,"I bought this car with 58,315 miles on the 2.7 V-6 engine. Knowing the issues associated with this engine, I performed a motor flush, switched to full synthetic motor oil, and replaced the PCV valve. Also, I had the transmission flushed, cooling system flushed, and tune up performed. This is a good, reliable car and solid for being 8 years old. Not knowing how the previous owner cared for the vehicle, I had all that preventive maintenance done. I average about 27 mpg with my Sebring and for the most part, I'm satisfied. "

Now I'm having to pay $5000 for an engine rebuild. Chrysler refuses to own any part of the problem has been happening since 1999.

It was exceptionally clean and well cared for with 114k on the clock, looked factory new inside and out. It's reliable, nice to drive, excellent driver ergonomics. The interior is tasteful and well built. The bodywork is of high quality. BUT! before you buy, check to see if the timing chain and water pump have been changed. Be aware that when the water pump fails as they all do eventually, it will end up fouling the engine oil if left too long as it's INSIDE the crankcase and runs off the timing chain. Repair is approx. $1350.00 at a Chrysler dealer. Be sure to factor this in when haggling! Check your coolant often!"

My car now has 93,000 miles on it and has lost considerable fuel mileage. I'll have it tuned up this year, but stay away from Bosch Platinum+4 plugs. I used those in my last tune up and lost 3-4 mpg's. Other than that I'm still happy with my car. The engine is clean, no sign of sludge and I still run full synthetic oil through it. I've been doing a lot more driving with it over the last year and have no qualms with the reliability of my car. My car, by the way, is actually an LX, but with the V-6 engine. Edmunds doesn't include the V-6 option with the LX."

I have changed the oil religiously about every 3000 miles, changed the tranny fluid, and done other preventative maintenance as suggested.  The only problem I have had with my vehicle is with the seat belt light staying on.  I changed out a fuse and had the box reset and that helped for about two weeks.  The light came back on.  It doesn't bother me to have the light on so I leave it alone.  The only other problem I had was with some small piece in the system that cost about $100 (it caused the car to shut down at stop lights).  I got that fixed and everything is ok again.  It has been a great car..no lemon.  I am over 100k mi. now."

chrysler,sebring,2002,man_on_wheelz, 08/11/2016,"Turns heads for cheap, but has it's downsides.",4,"This is definitely a good buy! I have no regrets with this purchase. The car overall is a real head-turner. With the top down, children love staring at it as you drive by, and adults often give you the thumbs up or start conversation. So many people want to go for a ride in the car as so many people have never ridden in a convertible and with the comfort and space you can easily take 3 people with you on the ride. Trunk space is plenty for a convertible with the top down. And the top goes up and down in like 6 seconds or so quietly and easily. Unlike some cars you can even operate the top up to around 10 MPH. There is no roll over protection so... don't flip it! But it's got a nice low center of gravity anyway so chances of flipping are low. The aerodynamics in this thing is phenomenal! Driving over 70mph on a windy rainy day on the countryside was a breeze. You can hear when the wind hits the car but it stays the course very well. And I personally get a kick out of the sound of the wind getting sliced by the wipers as it wipes. With a good, tight top on the car (like new) the noise level with the top up is very minimal and similar to a standard hard body car. Warning though, when I got mine used, the back window on the top was separated from the cloth causing a leak in the back into the trunk. Chances are you'll need to replace the top. There's a site that can sell you one for around $500, that's where I got mine, and put it on myself. Took 2 people with no experience in convertible tops but we got it done and it looks great! Took us a whole day lol. One of my biggest complaints though is the electronics. The headlights are not very bright so I recommend getting one with working foglights. And also I'm having a fight with my headlight switch as it seems to now be tied to my foglights. Headlights turn on, foglights come with for no reason! I've gone through several switches and eventually each one either ties my headlights to the foglights, or fog lights stop working altogether. I'd rather it stay on all the time which is my current issue, I can live with this. Also my door locks sometimes don't lock/unlock with the key fob... other times it does. And there's a connector under the passenger seat tied to the airbag system that frequently lights my airbag light. I every so often have to get out and push it together to get it to turn off. This car has gremlins I swear. But still when everything is working fine its a great car I still recommend it greatly!

It does have the 2.7 V-6, which I am familiar with the oil sludge issue, but will take care to prevent clogging with regular oil changes and motor flushes.

I couldn't continue with the Mazdas because they got too pricey for me at the time so I went American  and boy am I happy I did.  Only  had to do basic maintenance- brake pads- rotors - new tires etc.  But nothing else!  I hope a I have as good luck with my next purchase.

Still having overheating and antifreeze leaking issues.  I hope it can be fixed but it is now starting to nickle and dime me.  I guess I can't complain since it never gave me a problem until 2007.

The 2.4L DOHC 4-Cylinder has more than enough pep for running around town and on the highway without the A/C, but you can feel a big loss of power with the A/C on. The exterior styling has to be one of the nicest I have seen. The interior styling is also very nice, good layout of all the controls. The sound system is superb! This car seems to go through rotors from warpage quite often, it also seems to wear out outer tie rod ends quickly, and the auto trans in these cars go bad just looking at them, without proper care and feeding.

Once the extended service warranty ran out, all these were VERY expensive to fix! Brake pedal FROZEN at cold temps! Apparently I'm the only one who had this problem? We don't have a garage.

Also   bad on repairs ---once over 100k,,   you need to  rebuild  the car ,  all the way , use Nappa  parts ,its a wise move. Chrysler does not make cars for long lasting ,  every Chrysler product  gobbles parts , the convertible is some what better than  the rest of the line, but expect to put $$$ in.

How can they make such good mini-vans (I am on my 3rd), yet make such a poor quality convertible.  There has never been a time when there wasn't something seriously wrong with it.  It leaks trans fluid, oil and coolant.  I just got it inspected again at the dealership, currently, the trans solenoid pack needs replacing, the oil pan and oil pressure sending switch is leaking, the rack and pinion is shot, the door ""clips"" are broken, the leather seats are tearing and I just replaced the right front hub bearing.

The body style and the interior is very nice. I enjoy the 3.0 engine. I just wish it had a little more power. But. My issues I'm having on both cars are a Over Heating Issue. Seems like when Im driving up a hill, the car over heats. And, In the summer time. The car over heats alot.. I Have to run the air constantly to keep the fans going.. I was wondering if anyone else has this issue and if anyone could tell me what that is..."

Convertible GTC.. Amazing!!!  Wonderful 
to drive and looks great!!! Punch the

chrysler,sebring,2002,Veronica NJ, 03/27/2002,Very fullfilling...extremely satisfied,5,"My Sebring definetely filled my expectations.  It is a beautiful, stylish, elegant, and not too sporty vehicle that is very fun to drive.  The gas mileage is great.  There is enough room to fit 3 people in the back with comfortable leg room.  The seatbelts are extremely comfortable, you hardly notice them.  The top comes down smoothly.  The sound system is powerful, this can be especially noticed when the top is down and the car is being driven in the highway.  I give this car a 10."
chrysler,sebring,2002,Terry Higgins, 06/20/2016,I just purchased my Sebring from a dealership auct,4,"I own a 5spd and I haven't seen too many more like it. I recently had a stage one clutch in it and I'm also going to put a hyper chip in it and possibly NOS. I've got over 200,000 miles on it but it drives like it's off the showroom floor. I have outrun brand new mustangs 5.0 & quite a few brand new trucks as well. And I haven't even put in my chip, or cold air intake. I don't think that I get anywhere near the estimated mpg on either.  It is what it is... I've got a service soon light on and it lists all kinds of possibilities. It's all mainly oxygen sensors and other small thing's.  I absolutely love my car.  Can't wait until I'm done with it, just to see how fast a 3.0 can go..

chrysler,sebring,2002,Shifter, 04/06/2009,GTC 5 SPEED: UPDATE,5,"Update: 44,000 miles.  My ""black-on- black beauty"" 5 speed manual continues to be just that.  The mirror-like finish remains deep and clear, and still maintains like-new appearance.  The last tank of fuel (city driving) yielded 23 mpg, and that fluctuates in a range of 21-23 city--all on original plugs.  With the exception of two switch replacements in the heat-ac blower, the car has been absolutely mechanically excellent.  One change noted, however, is the presence in Winter, when the cabin is cold, of loud squeaky sounds where the top meets the windshield frame.  As the cabin heats up the sound diminishes in loudness.  Handling remains tight & I love the 5 speed control in snow and rain."
chrysler,sebring,2002,pinehead, 05/20/2009,Dangerous Brake Problem,2,I bought this car new. With 2 weeks or purchase I noticed that the brakes were sketchy when the roads were wet. You could slam the pedal to the floor and the car just wanted to keep on going. The worst issue was when there was snow or ice on the road. I brought this car in to the dealership twice to have them check the brakes. They claimed there was nothing wrong. The back wheels would slip horribly in the snow. There was almost no control of this vehicle in those conditions. I went off the road twice with it driving 5 miles and hour. Chrysler refused to admit to a problem or do anything about it. I has 3 others drive the thing in snow and they all agreed that there was a problem .
chrysler,sebring,2002,adam07, 02/22/2010,Nice Car!,4,"Bought it new 8 years ago and still love this thing! Its so stylish and luxurious for $22,000. After 7 years the battery died once, the struts rattle on bumps and could use a replacement, and I need to replace the wiper blades because squeak really loud when you use them, so it has its typical wear and tear but the interior still has a newish smell amazing because I have 3 kids riding in it all the time! There is a lot of road noise but overall it is my favorite car I've had. I love the way it drives, it has sporty suspension which turns really well and has really good pick-up for a small V6 which means good gas mileage, I would say it gets about 23mph. Good job Chrysler!"
chrysler,sebring,2002,NewBuyer, 06/23/2002,"Fun, roomy convertible",4,"Attractive styling, good handling, 
roomy in front & back.  Every car has 
compromises, and this one is great fun 
and a very good mix of decisions that 
yield a vehicle that is good at 
cruising, good at the twisty-turning 
type of drives, and has good comfort."
chrysler,sebring,2002,Angelizz10, 04/28/2010,Love my convertible,4,"I bought this baby blue convertible new.  It gets really outstanding mileage that it automatically checks for you.  I am getting around 32 highway.  The only problem I have had during my 70,000 miles was at about 50,000 it wouldn't come out of 1st gear!  I drove it slowly, to the dealership where I purchased it.  It was a small plastic piece that I learned Chrysler had in it that wore out about that mileage.  I had extended warranty and they fixed it.  Glad I had it.  It is a snazzy looking car, and being blonde, I look good in it with the top down and Andre Bocelli playing when I head to the beach.  Great fun and would buy it again in a heartbeat."
chrysler,sebring,2002,msticks, 04/30/2002,Great Topless Fun,4,"This is my fourth convertible and third Sebring. I traded my 1998 Sebring JXi 
in on a 2001 Sebring Limited (the first one my dealer received). It was Dark 
Blue with the Cream Leather seats. I was very disappointed in that car. Had 
serious electrical problems from the get-go and had to have it back to the 
dealer several times. In addition the very pretty cream interior was a 
nightmare to keep clean. Got rid of that and bought a 2002 Sebring LXi with 
Taupe leather interior. MUCH better car. Never been back to the dealer, 
seems better put together than the Limited was. Very stiff structure and well 
insulated top makes you forget its a convertible, until you put top down."
chrysler,sebring,2002,snowdogg, 02/21/2008,GTC Needs Something,3,"This car is fun but all the design/build shortcuts make it a question mark as to how long it will hold up. I drive more than 20K miles a year and can see potential problems ahead. At 50K the brakes seem like they need to be replaced, the suspension groans and creaks, the body has lots of rattles and there are small but annoying noises coming from behind the dash. The washer fluid freezes in the winter, the car takes very long to warm up, there is not even a height adjustment on the driver's seat and I can see wear on the convertible top from rubbing on the frame. i wish that I could say lots of good things about it. I really wanted to ""drive American"" but this unit is a disappointment!"

it feel so comfortable and cozy.  I 
have not had any real mechanical

Both were wonderful cars, and this sterling blue metallic 2002 Sebring Limited convertible is fantastic for the money.  I love the cream and navy interior.  I never considered myself a Chrysler booster, but I have to say the fit and finish are great, and it is just so fun, and a great drive even in the cold with the heat-adjustable seats, great handling and autostick.  (mine came with all the toys.)  The autostick is really great for getting better mileage, which is about 22-23 city, 28-30 highway, and the autostick is very fun without having to kick the clutch all the time."

purchased the first thing I could find. My 
heart was not in the purchase. I will say the 
car has grown on me and it gets a lot of 
compliments. It has been very reliable, kinda 
hard on brakes though. Sunroof  vibration is 
really annoying at low speeds.  I wish the 
sunroof was retractable into the roof. Cup 
holders are to far away for easy use.  Great

chrysler,sebring,2002,Imdoug, 07/12/2004,My Sebring,5,"Since I have purchased my Sebring in 
2001 I have not really had any problems 
with the car.  I have had the regular 
oil changes and tire rotations.  This 
has been a great car and gets the looks. 
 I have people all the time wanting to 
know what year the car is and they can't 
believe that it's a 2002.  I have to say 
this has been one of the best cars that 
Chrysler has made.  I of course would 
love to have the 2004 Chrysler 300M.  
The limited edition one.  I just can't 
find one.  I would love to see them make 
that car again."

moved from Georgia to Colorado and the 
pick-up onto the highway, or even  
into traffic from a stop is terrible!!
I even had it looked at, at the dealer 
to see if the altitude was affecting 
the engine or it need some adjustment, 
they thought I was crazy. Not only 
that, but it just passed 55,000 miles 
and has been in the shop twice in the 
past six months! Once for overheating 
when something broke, and just this 
week for the air conditioner

chrysler,sebring,2002,Keith, 12/29/2004,excellent car,4,"This is the first, and certainly not the last, Chrysler that I have purchased.  I consistently get 24- 25 MPG with 2.7 V-6 and have recorded 30 on the highway.  This is the only car that I have purchased new that has never had any warranty work done, period.  The only complain that I have is the cheap Goodyear tires that came with the vehicle - (replaced after 32000 with Toyo tires that are much quieter and ride better).  Overall, I would definitely recommend this car to anyone that is looking for a sedan. "
chrysler,sebring,2002,Wade, 12/29/2004,Fun Car to Drive,5,"I have had my Sebring for a year now and I love it.  I bought it with 30k.  I did have some problems with the mileage odometer not working properly, it would flash NO BUS.  This happened right at 35k and was repaired by a Chrysler Dealership at no charge of course.  I was just wondering if anyone else has had problems with the A/C.  Sometimes the A/C will stop blowing cold air and it feels like just the vent is on.  If you tap the dash, however, the A/C kicks right back on.  I thought this was kinda weird and wondering if this was a problem that other Sebring owners have had.  Other than that I love my car."

These cars eat brakes. It's ridiculous. A couple of weeks ago, the car stranded me, transmission woes. I had to have the planetary gears replaced three times in the course of ten days. Finally they replaced the cas"" I assume that houses the gears. The day after I get it home, the OBD light comes on. My plans this weekend? To find another car."
chrysler,sebring,2002,snowdogg, 05/21/2007,Fun Daily Driver,4,"The Sebring GTC is my second convertible, much different from my '95 Cutlass Supreme. I plan on using this car for commuting on a year 'round basis (in Vermont). It remains to be seen how it will fare in winter, but with FWD and good snow tires I think it will be OK. Gas mileage is good at 28-30 mpg on regular, the top is truly weatherproof and interior quiet with top up."

This is the only convertible that would work for my family size wise (great trunk space and can even fit a bale of hay in it!). Only issue ever with this car is ""nagging"" Air Bag light warning, that can't seem to be corrected. No set offs or anything though.  And the car has been perfect otherwise. Have people offering to buy it often, but can't seem to part with it."
chrysler,sebring,2002,renewedamericanbuyer, 03/15/2008,A Piece of the 50,4,"Formerly a Jaguar owner going through a mid-life crisis, I decided to bite the proverbial bullet purchasing a Bright Silver Sebring GTC. Though not a Jaguar by far, it is an absolute joy to drive, except for the constant, rough transmission shifting in and out of 1st gear (auto), rain dropping in with a window open (a simple rain drip molding at the windshield would solve this issue), cheap interior trim that even Hyundai surpasses in quality, lack of what we currently deem necessary standard equipment absent, unavailable, or non-equipped from the factory, and an enhanced ownership program would be nice, after all, isn't that what the merger with Mercedes was meant to do? Where's the substance?!"

Grand Prix made up for it with lifetime oil changes though...so no complaints now!  Excellent car...very sturdy for a convertible - thank god we didn't buy the Cabrio (we were real close!), which felt like a Go Cart compared to this car."
chrysler,sebring,2002,Shifter, 05/11/2008,It's several years later from first revi,5,"It is now several years since my first posting.  I still love my GTC, and it still looks showroom-clean.  Twice the blower switch needed replacement, but aside from one headlight, the car has been trouble-free.  The 5 speed is the best on snow and ice, and I like the control in rush hour (especially as a way of conserving fuel given the current cost).  MPG in the city hovers between 21 and 24 depending on driving conditions.  My second review (first in 2006) still radiates enthusiasm for this car.  I still wish 1st gear had less resistance off the line, but all in all, I continue to love this car.  A little Meguiar's Instant Detail keeps the black a high gloss and the wheels looking good.   "

The leather still smells new 7 years later and only the struts and wiper blades need to be replaced. The 2.7 V6 seems small but it really has a lot of zip. Overall its a nice car with lots of style interior and exterior, even 7 years later it looks really good. The FWD is still good in Michigan winters! "

fine) and the rear window defroster 
broke (they fixed it right the first

gets much better mileage. The thing that amazes me is that this car feels 
more stable on the highway, is more surefooted in inclement weather and 
provides ALMOST as many amenities as the 300M at a much lower price.  I 
honestly can't understand why anyone would pay more for an intermediate 4

In March of '08, at 77k, the car died.  4 weeks and $4,400 later, I got my car back after the computer and entire engine had been replaced.

I took it to Mt Ephraim Dodge 9/26/09 and paid $131.61 for a new transmitter. 10/01/09 my car would not start! I called the dealer and was told maybe the alarm burned out the battery. Now I have to pay $98.00 for a diagnostic test. On top of that when I turn my steering wheel to its furthest point left or right it makes this screeching sound. I was told I need to $48.99 to check it. If I need a Power Steering Pump it will cost me $110 for parts and if it is the Rack N pennon (??) the parts will cost $600.72 not including labor.  
chrysler,sebring,2002,sarasotagene, 11/09/2009,Can't Find Parts,3,Great car but when it breaks you may have problems getting parts. I had to work hard to find after market lifters for the top because Chrysler was not making them.  Can't have a convertible with the top not going up

$19K (after rebate).  If you're thinking about a Camry or Accord, think again. 
 They cost about $5K more and I just don't see much difference, other than 
the Sebring is much better looking.  The suspension is unbelievable.  The 
whole car's attitude is ""Bump?  What bump?"".  The engine has tons of get

Everything they've fixed has to get 
redone within 13 months. 2 
transmisions, 3 CV jonts, 4 batteries, 
3 lateral arms,5 cd players, the front 
and rear brakes were done and both had 
to be replaced in 10 months. I tried to 
contact Chrysler and they tell me I 
should have had the work done at a 
dealer. I DID!!! They will not stand 
behind their work. I've talked to a few 
mechanics and other Sebring owners and 
aparently the transmision is a common 
problem with this car. I'll never buy a 
Chrysler again."

chrysler,sebring,2002,robrown, 09/25/2002,WOW. I love this GTC,4,"I really like the new Sebring GTC. I was considering buying a Mustang until I 
drove the Sebring. It rides better, feels more powerful, and has real rear 
seating.The gearing for the 5 speed trans is perfect. Good power across the 
band. The top is really easy to lower and raise. The cover for the top is also 
very easy to install. I have owned a mustang, corvette, and trans am. 
I never considered this car until it was offered with a 5 speed."

convertible and we both like it very 
much(actually, she's in love with it). 
We've had it only for a week and it's 
definitely a keeper.  While I'm a SUV 
guy, I can't complain about the 
interior room for a convertible.  The 
exterior is nice but still a ""girly"" or 
feminine car.  Performance is great and 
the sport suspension handles the road 
very well.  Acceleration is 
surprisingly aggresive. Definitely 
build to be driven with the top down
(not enough head room with top up).  
The 2-tone leather and 4 disc in-dash 
with 150w Infinity speakers are worth 
every penny."

sure the dealer is doing their job.

The resale value is terrible."
chrysler,sebring,2002,shtief, 08/14/2002,Great car!,4,"Great value in this price range. Nice 
low profile, good pick-up, fun to 
drive. Passengers in the back seat are 
out of luck...there is not much room 
back there, especially with a tall

strange, and the sun visors are 
essentially useless on the side 
windows."
chrysler,sebring,2002,W.A. Duff, 02/11/2008,A Fun-to Drive Practical Commuter Car,4,"I did a spreadsheet comparison before I bought the car and am satisfied that I made a good choice.  I have had more repairs than I anticipated, but it (so far) never stranded me on the road.   Mid-grade gasoline provides good performance with the 5-speed manual transmission.  I don't notice any difference with premium gasoline. The turning radius is too wide, but I am comparing it to my Mitsubishi 3000GT.   I just looked at a another(2008)coupe, with manual transmission.  It seems like a great car, but it offers too few advantages over my paid-off Sebring to persuade me to ""upgrade"" at this time.   I will keep it in mind, however, as the Sebring ages."
chrysler,sebring,2002,quip, 05/01/2002,A winner,4,"The Sebring LXi is an all around great 
car especially so when price is 
factored in. I got a 2002 LXi sedan 
loaded with everything except the sun 
roof and I walked out the door for less 
than 24K including sales tax. 

On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being a 
complete lemon and 10 being impossible 
to achieve for 23K, I give it an 8."
chrysler,sebring,2002,bkr1222, 12/09/2002,Sebring LXi,4,"I really enjoy driving the 2002 Sebring 
LXi.  The engine performance has been 
great.  My one complaint is the turning 
radius.  It makes very wide turns which 
makes manuevering difficult.  Overall, 
the Sebring LXi is very enjoyable.  It 
is sporty, yet comfortable."
chrysler,sebring,2002,ox13man, 12/27/2002,Not a bad set of wheels,4,"I did a fair ammount of research (with 
other cars in its class) before 
springing for this one.  The interior 
is well laid out and intuitive.  The 
performance is sufficient as well-not 
pressing me to the seat, but not 
leaving me waiting for the gear to 
shift (its an automatic).  The car is a 
little heavy, but at high speeds it 
glides like a dream.  At low to 
moderate speeds it accelerates and 
corners very well (much to the dismay 
of my passengers).  About the only 
downside is that it has the typical 
clunky Chrysler transmission.  Overall, 
a good car though."
chrysler,sebring,2002,Bryangm, 01/17/2003,Just OK car,4,"  The body is very sold.  Build quality 
seems very nice.  Has some of the most 
comfortible seats ever. The 4 wheel 
disk brakes are excellent!
   The transmission in this car is 
junk!  It clunks, sometimes wont 
downshift, and other times downshifts 
at the wrong time so the car lurches 
violently.  Sometimes it wont go into 
gear even when its in drive, then will 
drop into gear with a loud clunk. This 
is with only a little over 10k miles.  
BEWARE!  Their 7 year warranty thing is 
a scam!  You can take the car back 50 
times and their so called ""Specialists"" 
will tell you theres nothing wrong with 
it.  This is with the 4 speed automatic 
with AutoStick."

25 years before I owned this car. I 
never knew that driving could be this 
fun. On nice days, when I see other

amazed.

Mine is white exterior, black top, tan

it just oozes ""summer fun.""  The V6

Since we are not truck drivers and with two small kids, I decided on this car due to value, space, design and reputation. The car has served us very well. I would rather spend my money on something more meaningful than a stupid car; especially since my kids have turned the back seat in to a drive- in restaurant. I love the gas mileage and handling even though I am a speed enthusiast at heart. The only repair on the car has been the break pads and we had a problem with the A/C that was fixed for $125. The foregoing is after almost four years and 29,000 local driving miles. You can not go wrong for the money."

it brings back fond memories of 
my ""Pony Car"" days from the '60's and 
70's.  Her name is ""Korbel"" after the

I get compliments on the body style all the time, and the black paint looks so sleek!  Well, it used to until it recently started to fade and oxidize like you wouldn't believe.  Especially on the roof and trunk.  Dealer said they'd cover the cost of repainting those areas, so we'll see how that goes.  Other than the paint, it's been a great car, and I've had no major problems.  "

drive or ride in as a passanger.  I am 
in my car a lot so this was important.  
The standard features are plentiful and 
controls are well located .  My biggest 
complaint is a noise that the dealer 
has not yet been able to correct.  I 
have made 5 attempts already to get it 
fixed. Also the back seat became too 
cramped when we added a baby car seat

Wish 1st gear afforded greater and longer oomph off the line.  That being said, the power is adequate and the growl audible as the GTC whines through the gears quickly toward a rapidly achieved 60. Four-windows-down is terrific!  Black finish is mirror- like perfect.  I actually like the non- glitz of the interior with minimal amenities.  The 4 CD changer is outstanding!  The heater in Winter (or cool evenings with top down)is the best! Inside of top is well padded and nicely hides structural bars. Back seat room is simply the best! The top boot cover is easy-on and easy-off."

and I love the 5-speed.  The interior 
is a little plain though.  It would be 
nice to have pockets on the backs of 
the seats for maps, etc.  I have not 
had ANY trouble with the car at all.  
I have only had it into the dealership 
once and that was because the 
passenger window was sluggish when 
putting down the top.  It wasn't all 
the way down when the top was!  "

chrysler,sebring,2002,Stu & Cathy, 03/13/2003,Simply AWSOME!,4,"This is our second Chrysler. We LOVE 
it! I would drive this car on any long 
vacations and never get tired. It gives 
a wonderful smooth ride and when needed 
lots of ZOOM! They did a great job 
following the Cirus with the Sebring. 
Only complaint is the its a little 
thursty when it comes to gas in the 
city."
chrysler,sebring,2002,Sad and Broke, 03/21/2005,Verrry Disappointed,4,"Car is a great car if you want to pay full price for limited life of the engine.The problem with this car is the unreliabilty issues with the 6.7 liter engine. I had the car checked by a Chrysler center the day before I left on vacation and the service department could find nothing wrong even though a service engine light had come on. 250 miles away from home, the engine light came back on and I was on the interstate on a Saturday with two small kids and nothing open. Rented a car for three days and another week while waiting on a part to come in.A year later at 74k miles just over warranty, the engine went.  Repair shop said familiar story on these 6.7L engines.  Cost $3,000 for new motor."
chrysler,sebring,2002,Staci A, 07/17/2005,My first family car!,4,"I bought this car used and I LOVE it. We have a 2 year old in a car seat and a baby on the way, so we needed a car with plenty of room. It's got enough room in the back seat for adults to be comfortable even if front seats are pushed all the way back. I looked into foreign make cars, but ones this price range were so tiny. I get lots of compliments because even though this is our family car, it looks really nice. My dad has this car too (and he's a tough sell). The less-than- great gas mileage doesn't bother me since I work, go to church and my daughter's sitter are all within a 3 mile radius of my home."
chrysler,sebring,2002,Paul H. Emerson, 08/01/2005,Paul's Review,4,"Excellent comfort and style. Fun to drive.  Only problem, which is typical for all convertibles, is some wind noise around the convertible top and some water leakage with rain"
chrysler,sebring,2002,SeebSedan, 08/10/2005,Good Value,3,"In April of 2005 I bought a used 2002 Chrysler Sebring Sedan LX.  I was coming from a 2000 Neon that suffered a lot of road and engine noise.  Needless to say I was more than impressed with the 2.7L V6 and adequate interior space.  Like others I think the dash design is a little dated but the fit and finish is nice.  The front seats are wide and supportive.  So far no mechanical problems, however the engine must be revved to about 5500 rpms to get any notable acceleration.  Once and a while when the headlights or driving lights are on, and I turn on the turn signal the interior lights blink on and off - has anyone else had this problem?"
chrysler,sebring,2002,Terje Thomassen, 09/19/2005,Drop the top for exhilaration!,4,"Originally purchased an '01 LXI but totaled it 13 months later when another driver ran a red light. Both air bags deployed and the unibody absorbed the impact, protecting me from any bodily injuries. I immediately purchased an 02 LXI and was happy to see that the V6 was improved with a double overhead cam. The acceleration is addicting and hitting 110 mph with the top down was a super thrill. I upgraded the tires to a high performance Yokohama AS430 and this LXI craves the curves at any speed. Drove from Texas to Georgia with two teenagers for a two week vacation and had plenty of room for all the bagage. This car was a breeze to drive for 8hrs or more at a time, plus it's easy on gas."
chrysler,sebring,2002,Bob, 09/19/2005,Bob's Review,4,"Fun to drive. This is my first convertible and I love it. There is plenty of power, lots of bells and whistles, and a unique sense of style, all rolled into one. I looked at several makes of convertible, and this one offered the biggest and best bang for the buck."
chrysler,sebring,2002,Andy, 11/10/2005,nothing but problems,3,"Although the car is fun to drive when everything is right, it has rarely been right for any extended period of time.  The first three years we had 3 starter changes, one computer change, and various other engine problems.  It died on us 3 times.  After that a series of repairs were needed because various parts of the undercarriage support kept breaking.  It felt like an old clunker. Even the new struts we bought were defective.  Would strongly recommend that anyone buying a Sebring plan on also buying an extended warranty."
chrysler,sebring,2002,coach b, 12/05/2005,great vehicle,4,"I bought this car new 3 and a half years ago.  Have really enjoyed it.  Love the style and drive.  The only work I've had done on the car has been brake replacement.  I do a lot of stop and go driving.    The car runs great.  Smooth drive and outstanding pick-up.  The infinity sound system is also a big plus. The rear seat room is tight, but to be expected in a coupe.      "

there were several things that had to 
be fixed, incorrect bezel on the gear 
shift (mine has the autostick but the 
bezel was for the regular 
transmission), drivers power window 
motor needed replaced, drivers seat 
loose, and heated seats did not 
function.  Took it on a trip to New 
Orleans from Indiana the first month 
and noticed a noise at 70mph.  After 
several times in service, including a 
three week transmission re-build they 
determined that it was not the 
transmission but wind noise and could 
not fix the problem."
chrysler,sebring,2002,Bill Warren, 06/14/2006,Despite the reviews - I love my Sebring!,4,"Having owned 3 Accords prior to my Sebring, I was surprisingly pleased at how much I enjoy driving this car! I love the exterior styling and get many compliments on it. Granted ... the 4 cycl engine is a bit rough, but I find it very responsive and able to make a freeway entrance ... okay, noisily & not particularly refined when you floor it... but I have never wished for more power. The front seats are very comfortable, the handling is quite good & a good ride. I am always surprised when reviews come up short ... and I, personally, have had zero problems with the reliability of my car. I'm really looking forward to seeing the new 2007 model ... a smaller version of the 300? We'll see ..."

I am amazed at the equipment I have on my Sebring as I own a 2000 Cadillac Deville and a 2001 Lincoln Town Car and the Sebring has all the equipment they have including all the little toys like compass, thermomitor, etc.  So far, I have had a great deal of fun driving this little car.

For the price and style it stood above the rest. It is a fun car. Since I have owned however,  I have had it in the shop for various repairs in excess of 30 days. It has had oil light problems, overheat problem, alignment problems. God help you if you had to change the battery. I am on my 3rd roof motor. the fabric is tearing on the roof as well.

I have had no mechanical problems, just change the oil and go. Power, handling and looks are great.  The only unusual problem I had was that one of the chrome wheels rusted around the rim and it was impossible to get a good seal to the tire.

Upper strut mounts on front were replaced causing cupping on tires - I thought it was alignment. Seat heater relay replaced as well as rear spring cushions - all faulty from factory. These are minor issues that could happen with any make. The car still delivers 23 - 24 city and 28 hi way. I just now replaced the front brakes at 71k (that is a first). Car is still tight, no road noise, great mileage, excellent sound system, leather has held up well. This is my wife's daily driver, no kids. "

am very pleased with this vehicle.  The 
ride comfort and performance are 
balanced perfectly.  You can enjoy both 
long trips (or commutes) and at the 
same time dive into a corner without 
worrying about losing control.

The car drives faster than you feel so 
it is easy to exceed the speed limit.  
Even with the automatic, acceleration 
is great.  This is the lowest priced 
true 4 seat convertible on the market, 
so if you must go topless, go Sebring."

Mine is loaded with every option but 
ABS.  Driving the car is pure 
pleasure.  The V6 is silky smooth and 
really pulls hard.  The 5-speed shifts 
smoothly and the clutch uptake is 
perfect.  The intake/exhaust sound when 
you wind it up is the perfect blend of 
turbine-like harmonics.  The interior 
is nice, with leather seats and an 
terrific Infinity sound system.  I'm

I opened my eyes and saw the 3rd car coming and jumped the heck outta there and over the wall.  Yes I could still run and jump! That car was smashed up everywhere except INSIDE. The passenger compartment was largely intact.  A front passenger would've been worse off than I, but there's no way I should've just walked away.

The window stripping does not dry out, the whole vehicle smells musty. I would suggest carrying an oxygen tank with you so you can breathe. Loud inside cabin noise does not make for a pleasant ride. The passenger seat does not lock into place, & can't be fixed. It's been into two different Chrysler dealerships to be repaired, after 10 times, still nothing has changed. If Chrysler thinks they can produce cars with such little care & quality they should think again. If you complain too much they might not service your car, they did it to me."

With features like roomy back seat, glass rear window, tight handling and peppy engine, it feels more like a sports sedan.

chrysler,sebring,2002,ConvertMan, 03/29/2002,Unbeatable Convertible Value,5,"After test driving many convertibles over the past month, I have come to the conclusion that the Chrysler Sebring is by far the best value out there. If you're buying a convertible to enjoy with friends or family, this is the only car that will allow you to have 3 other adults tag along. The BMW 330ci and others in its class don't come close to the passenger comfort afforted in the Sebring.  
Add to that the stylish looks, perky engine (200 HP is a must), leather trimming, front-wheel drive and you have a wonderful package in the Sebring. And, it's made in the USA!

I wholeheartedly recommend it."

drive one and see for yourself. Compare

it.  My car doors lock on their own
after I leave the vehicle and the
dealership said it can't be

unlock the doors again.  

I also had to have a new instrument
cluster installed because the tachometer
was working sporadically.  The dealer
couldn't set my mileage on the new
odometer, so now I have miles on the
odometer with the REAL miles on a

Inside the car, the visors, shift knob, automatic dimmer on the rear view mirror,

I added a full warranty that got my leaky evaporator fixed for nothing. Otherwise the car has been great.  the previous owner did not take great care of the car, but it was in great mechanical shape except for the A/C problem and poor shifting of the transmission.  Since it had less than 70,000 miles on it, I had the dealer look at it, and with a computer upgrade, now it shifts perfectly.  I run Prolong in the engine and it gets around 26 mpg on the freeway at 65 mph.  I cannot complain, for a 200 hop V6 engine, that is great mileage.  the engine is bigger than my 95 Dodge Stratus and gets better mileage."
chrysler,sebring,2003,OcalaJo, 06/24/2010,I'm so disappointed in Chrysler,3,"I've only owned Chrysler products (30+ yrs.); this is my last. The car is beautiful (after 7.5 yrs., the exterior is almost as beautiful as new, roomy, handles great, feels solid, the stereo is fantastic. It's a great ride--when it's working properly. But, the car spends so much time with my mechanic, I feel like it's cheating on me! Right after warranty expired, so did the transmission, and it's been one thing after another since! I've never had so many things go wrong with one car--and I've owned two others for 10+ years each! I'm really sad to be looking at other manufacturers' vehicles now."
chrysler,sebring,2003,bremensedai99, 10/30/2002,Sebrings Rock,5,"Driving in this vehicle is sooooo fun. 
While the interior design is not as 
good as the 2000 model, it is still a 
gorgeous vehicle. Drives great, looks 
great, sounds great."
chrysler,sebring,2003,slider5, 11/12/2002,Sebring as reliable as ever,5,Works great.  Good performance.
chrysler,sebring,2003,Peter Larsen, 11/28/2002,Excellent car,5,"I have been close to 100% satisfied 
with my Sebring conv. True: It's not 
quite at Audi or BMW levels when it 
comes to interior plastics, but if it 
had cost $15000 more, it probably 
would have. It is very rigid (a 
pleasure to drive over diagonal RR-
crossings !) Engine is happy to do 
what you ask it to, excellent. 
Transmission adjusts itself to shift a 
bit on the slow side, but that's most 
likely due to my agerage driving style 
(bumper to bumper traffic). I have had 
a couple of minor problems, one power 
window went bad after the car was rust-
proofed (by the dealer). Not their 
fault really, and handled without 
discussion. Highly recommened."
chrysler,sebring,2003,stvkrenim, 12/13/2002,Wow...impressive car.,4,"The car has a surprisingly comfortable 
and quiet ride, a dramatic improvement 
over the '96 Cirrus I used to own.  
The interior seems a lot nicer, too.  
The car's engine is peppy enough for 
most situations, but when you really 
want to get moving quickly, the 2.4L 
engine is somewhat taxed by the car's 
weight.  It never really feels truly 
underpowered...but it never feels like 
it has power to spare, either."
chrysler,sebring,2003,Jonathan Anoldussen, 12/26/2002,I Love My Sebring!,4,"Yes, I've only had my car for a month, 
but truly love driving the car.  The 
reason I only gave it a 9/10 for 
reliability and build quality is that 
there have already been a few tiny 
problems in the car, such as a 
creaking driver door and whistling 
vents.  However, short of a 300M, I've 
never driven such a gorgeous car!"
chrysler,sebring,2003,luckypilot, 07/17/2011,Never Again,2,"As a family we have owned our Sebring since new. It was one of those cars that would never fail for anything. Recently (within the past 6 months) if one thing has gone wrong everything has. Transmission, Cats, Head gasket, intake manifold gaskets. After nothing but Chryslers in our family since 1992, I am currently looking to buy something from another brand."
chrysler,sebring,2003,kketchum, 02/07/2011,First Convertible,4,"I bought this car from my dad, who luckily for me, kept it very clean and up to date on all of it's scheduled maintenance.
It's been a great first convertible to own.
I plan on driving it until it doesn't run anymore, which will probably quite some time from now.
The leather interior, heated seats, 6 disc changer make it hard for me to find another convertible with the same features for the value that I've gotten with this car.
Plus, I get lots of attention in it when the top is down - someone always needs directions! :)"
chrysler,sebring,2003,GregginStPete, 02/15/2003,Classy and Sporty with a hint of Luxury,4,"Today marks one month with my '03 
Sebring LXI Coupe. To date I am very 
pleased with my purchase and also enjoy 
a level of exclusivity that was not 
expected. The Sebring is an interesting 
blend of Japanese components and 
American Design, with some German 
influence thrown into the mix. 
(Mitsubishi, Chrysler, and Mercedes).  
I have not seen another car like mine 
on the road and receive a good amount 
of looks from other drivers often in 
high-end vehicles. Overall I find the 
Sebring to be a sporty blend of luxury 
and style with a good amount of 
passenger and cargo room. Fit and 
finish are good and better than most 
American cars."

dazzling exterior!  Now it not only 
looks sporty, it's looks more stylish

is so appealing and such a head 
turner!  I feet so cool riding down the

Thank you for the better paint because 
I had problems with my paint on my 
1998.  I also love the 4-CD in dash

chrysler,sebring,2003,Mr. C, 07/12/2003,2003 Sebring,5,"The car is fun to drive, gets 
excellent gas mileage, and rides very 
comfortably.  It has plenty of power, 
and handles well.  The interior is 
very roomy and seats four 
comfortably.  Trunk space is a bit 
limited, but fold down rear seats 
reduce that problem."
chrysler,sebring,2003,Lindsey, 03/03/2004,"Love it, has few probs,saved me in wreck",5,"I have only had the Sebring GTC 
convertible for half a year but I love 
the car. It was so much fun in 
summer. I recently got in a really 
bad car accident.  The police told me 
that I was lucky to walk away.  I'm 
not saying that the Sebring is safe, 
because convertibles are definitely 
not the safest cars to drive, but the 
crumple zones worked and the airbags 
deployed.  So despite a few bruises, I 
walked away fine.  Overall, I love it 
and it is so much fun.  In my first 
wreck I get hit from behind and the 
guys car was smashed pretty badly and 
all I got was a small dent in the 
bumper.  But in my head on crash, the 
whole engine and transmission got 
destroyed."

crystal clear and the entire thing 
feels so luxurious and safe.  I am a 
younger driver and it is very important 
for me to have an extremely well made

chrysler,sebring,2003,tman24, 04/11/2011,"Good, and Reliable",4,"I have owned this car for a year and a half. The previous owners treated it like crap, as in the oil looked like it had never been changed and the brakes ate the rotors, and there were cigarette burns in the seats. I got it for 3500 in 2009. I cleaned it out, changed the oil and brakes. Since then i haven't had any problems(short of vandalism) with the car. I bought it with 54k on it. It now has 75k and it feels better actually. You cant even feel the engine running, and shifts are smooth. I do all my own maintenance so i now know the car like the back of my hand. I feel the engine will last me at least 200k(my grandma sold hers with no problems at 150k)."

Then oil started to leak, had to fix that. Then the headlights wouldn't turn off, and electronics such as the heated seats stop working. But most of all, the engine starting knocking and I had to throw it out. Parts are expensive, and Dealers a pain. Done with GM!   "

it was a stylish four passanger car 
that gave it looks and made it 
functional for a family.  I selected 
Patroit blue with a cream leather 
interior.  This car turns heads!  It is 
fun to drive and comfortable on

creaking when braking and turning; 
noise is not present when only turning, 
however, I am told it is not a brake 
issue nor a safety issue.  Concerned 
about resale and wear/tear especially 
after out of warranty. Also, have 
excess wind noise on driver's side; 
excess brake dust; intermittent outside

I took it to Chrysler and they told me I needed a new engine. Confirmed by my own independent mechanic. I spent $3,000 on a used engine, installed. This year '06 I had to spend another $1,200 on a new transmission. All said I will have over $20,000 in this car when it's paid off. I have too much in it now not to drive it as long as I can.

I loved my Cirrus and was unhappy that Chrysler had discontinued them (and I bought my Sebring somewhat reluctantly)... WoW! were my fears unfounded.  The Sebring was a real step up in overall driving experience... It continues to be a wonderful vehicle, literally in every imaginable way. It truly feels/performs like a sports car.

I now have 63,000 miles on the car and have never been stuck. I would definitely consider another one, especially now that you can get one with the 3.5 engine.(My wife has that motor in her Pacifica). I get an honest 23-25 mpg around town.

chrysler,sebring,2003,Medium Height, 05/16/2003,"Good looks, poor view",3,"The oncvertible looks great and feels 
pretty good.  Its biggest draw back is 
the limited view that a moderately tall 
driver has out the front window.  Even 
with the driver's seat all the way down, 
the driver's view is blocked by the top 
of the front wind shield.  In addition, 
the locking mechanism for the roof and 
the sun visor hing on the convertible 
are unecessarily large and block an 
unecesarily large part of the driver's 
vision.  In addition, if the seat is 
lowered to accomodate a moderately tall 
driver, the back of the seat remains in 
the same position and, as a result, the 
lumbar support is in the wrong place."

acceleration/power is good off of the 
start, but excellent in rolling 
acceleration... if you floor it at 20-
50 you know it... and might be 
exceeding the highway speed limit

better steering reponse, and auto-stick

A person expects repairs, but not to the extent that this car has had.

However, I very seriously relate this directly to brand/type of oil more than bad design. If it was an engineering error, why then do soooo many of these surpass 200k+ miles. 
Have a competent mechanic check the engine before you buy the car. If no sludge, then you are good to go. Just use Shell Rotella 5w30 from that point on and you will not have issues. ( And I do not work for nor ""endorse"" Rotella, just stating the pure fact) Now, engine aside, the rest of this car is fair compared to others in it's price range.  Touring model ride is a lot on the stiff side though.  Have had MANY electrical issues. Engine computer died. Various electrical gremlins.  Every moving joint in steering & suspension shot by 130k. And it never seen a gravel road.  Rarely old chip & tar roads. 98% just pavement. Even the driveway is asphalt. 
The ride is rubbish. The steering is rubbish. The electrical system is rubbish. The whole car is GREAT, , , , , till about 100k. Then , , , , grab your wallet!   Good thing is these are getting so old now this updated review is probably falling on deaf ears.

With just over 108k miles, the only significant repair required was a transmission solenoid pack (or something like that) that started leaking at around 45,000 miles but was covered by the powertrain warranty.
I also replaced the original 2004 stereo so I could have bluetooth and all the modern audio ear candy.
Bottom line, if you maintain this car, it will last you a long time and you will have a blast driving it."

There are no fancy features like most new cars and no hi-tech info system but the simple straight forward controls have never failed to function as intended.

lovely convertible. 
Before doing any Vehicle History Reports I bought the car, it was a gut decision. It was a stupid risk to take but I am sure gald I took it. 
The car has power, don't let the low displacement number fool you, it can get up and go quickly
The road noise is low with the top up, and the roof never leaks even in the worst rain
Nothing has broken other than the rear ball joints,
only 200 to replace

The gas mileage isnt bad at all, the a.c/heat works so good compared to a lot of other cars and in the summer the convertible is so much fun. I've driven it on plenty of road trips with no problems.

I did not know that a plastic coolant outlet housing could rust out, but it did and blew coolant all over the top of the engine. Burns a quart of oil every 1,500 miles.

This model does hold up well in Northern environments and handle well in snow with appropriate tires, great A/C and heater.  Mileage is above average for model and year, does not require no-lead gasoline, or special formula, if driven in Northern environment where salt is used on roads.  You should look for signs of rust in rear wheel area, behind fender, undercarriage and frame holds up well, so does the 2.7 engine if properly maintained.  Do not listen to complaints on this engine, however make sure you do check for any major repair work, I did have to replace the complete power steering unit, include the front right wheel assembly due to poor manufacturing.  It is one of the reasons that I do ask you to check and make sure that the Sebring was made in America, and not Canada because of metric bolts...etc.
I still have this car today after fourteen years, with sixty-seven thousands original miles, just replaced the rear struts last year 2016.

Shocked that Chrysler put the 2.7 Liter engine in some of these 2004 Sebrings when there were hundreds of complaints about these engines.There's class action lawsuit re this 2.7 L engine which is apparently built in such a way that coolant gets into the engine,oil doesnt filter properly due to structural design and turns to sludge, and the engine holds less oil, thereby requiring more frequent oil changes.Chrysler and extended warranty co.'s refuse to cover cost, due to sludge even when customer produces oil change receipts.I still owe $9600 on the loan and new engine will cost half that."

this car requieres delicate maintenance to work well or will turn in to a piece of crap in few months.

makes me feel 10 years younger. It has 
a nice smooth comfortable ride and 
handles like a sports car. The good gas

I am impressed.  We had no real 
problems with the old one- some squeeky 
brakes while still under warranty- so 
we're hoping for the same this time.  I 
like the larger wheels and overall 
stance. Interior isn't changed much, 
but the optional seat heaters are a 
definite hit- you can leave the top 
down longer if you just turn on the 
seat heaters, a ragtop season

Was told it was a bad oil pressure sensor. My extended warranty that supposedly covered everything didn't cover it. It was replaced, 10 minutes after leaving the dealer it came on again. Was told it may be a bad oil pump, though the Nissan dealer i bought it from took it to a Chrysler dealer and all they did was replace it again and do an oil flush and change the oil ,free of charge. Took it home, found the Fog Lights stopped working. What next? It's too bad the under the hood issues take away from a great looking car. Cruises nice and gets good mileage with the V6."

The solenoid goes out every year, usually January or February. The sensors have minds of their own-my engine light is on more than it is off. I had to have a tranny overhaul this past February, as well as the solenoid replaced. Fuel economy is terrible, I don't give a damn what the specs say. The tranny pan gasket has been replaced twice. When the weather is cool/cold, there is a strange scraping noise coming from the rear axle.The seals on the headlight assemblies dry-rotted last year. Needs better sound barriers; very noisy when driving. Nevertheless, I have no complaints about performance or handling."

We replaced the front brakes twice in 3 years and then a caliper in the rear seized and that all had to be replaced. The thing that burned me the most is how expensive the parts are. To be fair; the car was a dream to drive and never once broke down, but I'm giving it a low reliability number because of the cost of maintenance. We ditched it in the end because of a rear suspension linkage going bad, the A/C pump starting to go, the power windows starting to go in the front, and emission test issues."

I found out it's the purge valve.  Then to top it off everytime it raines I have a flood on the driver side floorboard front to back seat.  It will cost me more to have them find out the problem because the dealership doesn't want to honor my warranty.  I'm trading it in as soon as possible.  More trouble than it's worth.

My biggest complaint is the front passenger window - it's temperamental. It works in cold weather but not in hot...I live in Phoenix. Enough said?

beats our Mustang convertible by 
miles. It has a much nicer interior 
and is free from the shake and rattles 
seen in our Mustang. The gas mileage

car I can say I am really impressed. I 
bought it for the wife for her

car almost drives itself. and its fun 
putting the top down and going for a 
drive. We have already gone to 
Montery, Pebble Beach, and lake Tahoe. 
The car just wants to go for a ride, 
so we havn't been home the last three 
week-ends. I like the auto stick for 
hills and curves. It also has a secure 
feeling ride.  This is the first 
Chrysler I have ever owned and I'm

only because an accident totalled the 
suspension of my 1998 Sebring.  (that 
car had less than 70K miles and still 
looked new - even after the wreck.  I 
was hoping for many, many more years.  
I took several long cross country 
roadtrips in the 98 - Highway 1, 
Yosemite, Vegas - what a way to 
travel.  Three could fit in well and 
see the country.  I look forward to 
similar trips in the 2004."

been one issue since I purchased it and 
that was an air bag light that has come 
on.  I wish that there was a little bit 
more compartment space.  The back seat 
is very spacious.  We drove with a 6 ft 
man in the back seat for 3+ hrs.  It 
would be nice to have a little more 
power under the wheel and have both 
seats be electronic adjustment instead 
of just the drivers side.  Otherwise, 
besides these few picky things, I am in 
love with my car.  "

the first one in 1981 (a Lee Iacocca K-
Car rattletrap).  Each model got 
progressively better, borrowing from 
the lessons learned from the Mitsubishi 
partnership.   Although my favorite was 
the 1987 (people would stop me on the 
street!) this one is the best 
performing and best conceived of all.  
New hot convertibles forget about the 
family - they are two seaters and are 
good as ""third"" cars.  The Sebring 
takes performance and merges it with 
family fun, but doesn't forget to look 
great when you are without the family, 
too."

Cons - none.
Things I have fixed/replaced - window motor (due to water getting in the door too many times), rear tie-rod ends, engine light has been on for like two years due to O2 sensor (have not fixed). Tune-up/flushed all fluids, etc at about 100,000 miles.

Very cheaply built & even though the body was mostly plastic, still had the standard Chrysler problem of pealing paint.
Interior plastic was cheap as well.

Reliable with one exception, brakes!!!!
I only put 40,000 miles on it and had to replace the brakes twice.
My two previous cars, Chevy and a Ford, I only replaced the brakes once on each with 60,000 to 80,000 miles on it.

My only other complaint is road noise.

It has been very reliable with the exception of the Rear Window Defroster that breaks every summer putting the top up and down. I chose not to replace the window. I am still using the factory Brakes, they will be replaced soon as they are at 5/32"" on the Pads! At 66,500 miles I replaced the Ignition Switch.

I thought it was the closest thing to a fancy car I was going to get being a student and low income. It has been nothing but a nightmare. To replace the battery, you have to remove the front wheel. To replace spark plugs you have to remove the upper plenum and intake. I haven't even gotten into whatever else I will have to do.

chrysler,sebring,2005,Steve, 12/30/2004,Excellent Car,4,"I was reading the reviews on this car
before I bought it, sloppy handling,
unrefined drivetrains??  I drove 8 hours
straight in this car, usually my back
starts to hurt or something, but not in
this car, very comfy, also at speeds
upwards of 95-100 mph, I couldn't even
hear the engine, a very quiet ride.

Two things that I do notice are low gas
mileage (but thats the same for all
gasoline powered engines), and also the
2.7 V-6 is a high-speed engine (churning
200 hp and only 190 torque), but if you
don't mind shifting down to get back to
the top-end, then it is alright.

In closing, I doubted my purchase
because the other reviews say the doors
are going to fall off, but not anymore!"
chrysler,sebring,2005,Brandy, 10/07/2010,Great car for awhile,3,"Bought my Sebring used in 2007.  Only problems until now were with rotors needing turning often and the rear spoiler coming off.  Recently the front crank seal blew out causing a severe oil leak.  Had it fixed and it happened again within minutes.  Discovered that there is a problem with this motor having crank shaft end play which causes the front crank seal to come out.  There is a bulletin on this problem, but no recall.  Currently awaiting Chrysler's response to see if they will take any responsibility since this is obviously a manufacturer defect since it has happened to so many of the 2005 motors."

After purchasing I was on my way home when I noticed the car had very bad shake at 45 mph and massive cowl shake that did not show up on test drives. Dealer stated this was normal, but that was after they rebalanced and replaced the tires. The car has gotten progressively worse and gets out of balance and alignment on the slightest bumps.

This car had only 26,600 miles when I bought it and I have 35,567 now, this is my first Chrysler product and will be my last!

chrysler,sebring,2005,N Sobieck, 06/14/2019,"I have the only Sebring to pass 200,000 miles?",5,"I bought this 2005 car used 12.2011, still have it today 06.2019. It had 47,000 miles under its belt. Last month the odometer turned over 200,000 miles. Yes, I've had to replace the camshaft senor 3 times, 1 upper control arm, 1 lower control arm, set of Struts, 1 rear brake pads and drums, 4 or 5 front disc brake pad with a few rotors. I replaced the timing belt and water pump with a timing and water pump kit well after the recommended time to change it. I use a synthetic mix oil for older cars and I change the engine oil every 5,000 miles. I'm by no means an automobile mechanic, but I know what to look for when buying a used car. I put on cover-all and look under the car and check for engine leaks. I have bought many used cars in my life time and the main problems with most vehicles are the owners didn't preform regular maintenance. I would ask the owners if the tires were replaced, if not I check the treads to see if the wear is even on the tire and does it match the tire on the other side. If the tires are new, I look at the tie-rods and control arms to see if they were replaced or ignored. For those that complain they got a 'lemon' from someone they trusted or someone told them there was nothing wrong with the car and bought a car in bad condition. Shame on them that lie, but shame on you for being so gullible. Most of the reviews I see are from people that don't get there cars maintained as they should be. Car reviews are more like a blog for people to complain how something failed cause something wasn't right while driving it and didn't take the time to investigate the problem.  Read your cars maintenance schedule and look at the odometer, it will tell you what will fail next, if you don't get the maintenance done, you wont be so surprised when you have to call a tow truck to take it to a shop to have repairs done.
06.14.2020,  I have since this original review have replaced the transmission. Yes it cost around $1,500.00 to replace. Its a used Trans from a low mileage vehicle, but with the exterior and interior being in mint condition. I knew I'd get more miles out of her.

chrysler,sebring,2005,jcuel, 03/20/2012,Best car I have ever owned,4,"I have owned my 2005 Sebring Limited since 2008 and its been the best car.
I bought the extended warranty but never used it once.
The only thing I had to do on it was the back end work which was costly and a heat shield fix.
I sometimes think I would like to get a new car but I think why when its been so good to me.
The leather seats are comfy and get better with age.
To be honest I was shocked by the bad reviews, maybe its because I have the limited but I haven't even had to replace the brakes yet and I have driven 50K on it over the past 4 years."
chrysler,sebring,2005,you got to be kiddin, 03/24/2010,I'm a Sucker,2,"I bought this car new in 2006.  The day I brought it home the computer board was shot and had to bring it back next day.  Since then nothing but trouble. Car came back with scratches all over the dash and again had to be replaced.  I have since paid for two sensors to be replaced had two seals and two belts replaced still not working had it done again and is now sitting in a pubble of oil outside my work.  I have had to replace brakes twice new tires and makes a constant noise I only have 39,000 miles on the car.  Worst day ever the day I brought home this piece of crap.  Too low to the ground, noisy and unreliable.  Even the sun roof leaks."
chrysler,sebring,2005,raymond wroten, 04/16/2005,My experience with the sebring,4,"My first sebring was the Limited which I really enjoyed driving. I traded to get a newer car and decided on the touring model. These cars are very similar although the limited had more features. Both are fun to drive, however on trips there is a definate lack of space for luggage. The only answer to this is to make the car slightly larger or redesign the trunk compartment. It is a great car. One other problem is that the dealers dont give true value on these cars in trade in. forcing customers to sell the car to an individule. This is a minus, both for the company and the owner."

chrysler,sebring,2005,Don Pelzel, 09/22/2008,Excellent Car,5,The car has been a pleasant surprise with the ride and fuel mileage. With 72000 miles with no problems. If I drive 70 miles an hour I have obtained over 33 miles to the gallon. Original tires and brakes. Very happy with this purchase.
chrysler,sebring,2005,tom galvin, 05/18/2009,pretty good car,4,"I have had this car 3 years now and no problems. My daughter has wrecked it a couple times almost totaling it. Holds up good in a bad accident, looks nice, has good power, comfortable. The car is great to drive around town and on the highway. When I brake the spare tire makes a thud noise and i've tried to anchor i down better but doesnt work. The car is good and I would say its upper class quality."
chrysler,sebring,2005,Tony, 07/29/2009,bought this car cheap,3,"I bought this 2005 Chrysler Sebring Convertible with 56,000 miles @$6500.00.  I wont say as this car hasn't proven reliability but it is a decent car.  For the price I paid for the car as I am going to use it to drive back and forth to college should do ok. The car shimmys at 45 mph and i just put on new tires, done a 4 wheel alignment.  My recommendations since Chrysler has had a reputation (bad) for the 2.7 liter v6 is to use full synthetic oil.  This is my first convertible ever and I do like driving with the top down.      "
chrysler,sebring,2005,starcrestsa, 09/05/2010,Beware of front driver side collision,4,"I was recently in an accident where the front driver's side was impacted. Thankfully, the driver was safe. Although this was at a low speed, the impact was strong enough to smash the battery.  Due to it's location, the battery acid made contact with computers, electrical & mechanical parts. Needless to say, it was considered totaled even though the damage did not appear as drastic on the outside. There was other structural/frame damage as well. "

chrysler,sebring,2005,Frank Smith, 09/01/2006,Great Car to impress your friends with,4,"Most of my friends either have a Honda or Toyota, and they are all impressed by the quality and comfort of the car.  They also like the fact it is bigger, so we can fit five much more comfortably.  One thing I will say is that the V6 is lacking in low-end torque.  I drove a 91' Olds before buying this car, and even though it has 40 less horses, it had better acceleration. Chrysler also needs to pay more attention to the tranny, shifts are sometimes rough."
chrysler,sebring,2005,Angela, 03/26/2017,Gremlins,1,"My Sebring started with driving down the road or just sitting in the parking lot, would start honking and the police were called because of the noise it was causing at my house in the drive way at 2am. Took it in 6 times before the problem was fixed. Never got an answer to what caused it. It made wierd noises everytime I turned it off. The inside lights would dim and brighten by themselves. Until finally the motor froze up and stopped. The repair man AND the insurance company told me that vehicle is one of the worst of that year. I probably will never buy another Chrysler.

chrysler,sebring,2005,Oldengineer, 12/02/2006,My Last Chrysler,2,"After 14 Chryslers, this is my last. The only thing this car does well at is get decent fuel economy. In 2 years of ownership, its been in the shop for warranty work a full 3 months in total. Its myriad problems and poor reliability have convinced me to switch brands.  It's a beautiful car, but, seems to have been engineered and built by blindfolded kindergarten kids.  Tried to get rid of it, but, this model depreciates like a falling brick."
chrysler,sebring,2005,favre44, 07/25/2009,best car ever!!!!!!!!!!!,5,"When I purchased this car in 2005, I loved it. I still do! I LOVE the seat heaters. Its the best part. When I sit in the car, I feel like royalty. The leather seats are Awesome because it makes me look rich! Got to love making the neibors jealous. Ha ha! It can fly! It can really go fast! BOTTOM LINE: This car is Awesome!!!!!!!"
chrysler,sebring,2005,Steve, 04/28/2005,better than our old 2000 sebring convert,5,Went the the auto show and tested all the convertibles from $25k to $85k. Liked the sebring the best bcause of its styling and size. You can put 2 sets of golf clubs in the trunk and still fit a cooler or two in there as well. Has all the options of the higher end cars for a lot less money. Real quiet ride. 
chrysler,sebring,2005,JayTee, 04/29/2005,Second Sebring owner,3,"I use the Sebring 4 door 2.7L as a compnay vehicle. It is the second one I've gotten. The first, a 2002 model, was traded at 75,000 miles.  No problems - ever! Why does Edmunds slam the interior? Look inside a Malibu, then look in a Sebring. I've driven both and I can say that the Malibu is built like a Yugo compared to the Sebring.  The interior of the Sebring is very well screwed together and not all all cheap looking - try to say that about any GM car. Brakes are excellent!!! Torque is a bit lacking. Gotta rev it hard, till the engine sounds like its coming apart. Aside from that,Chrysler really has come a long way. I am very pleased. Chrysler, please put a powerful engine in this car"
chrysler,sebring,2005,eileen vulpis, 05/27/2005,my car,4,I have been very happy with my car since the first day I bought it.  I am very comfortable in it it drives very well and all I can say is I recommend it all the time.
chrysler,sebring,2005,Ned, 05/31/2005,So far so good (knock on wood),4,"I've had Sebring for almost two years now. Pros: Chrysler design, great fuel economy (8.4L/100km - mixed highway/city drive), only minor issues. Very quiet ride (!!!) just the way I like it. More than enough power for whatever you need it for.  Cons: Front right and rear left window had to be fixed. One sensor had to be replaced. Brakes could be a bit better. Not happy with seat design - not very comfy on long rides.  I'm 6'2'' and I had to push seat all the way back. Head is still too close to the ceiling, yet that is okay. More than enough room for a passenger behind me to sit comfortably. I'm quite happy with it  for now. Would buy another Chrysler again."
chrysler,sebring,2005,Donna, 10/27/2006,"Rattles, Ticking, ohhh my....",3,"This was my second Sebring Convertible.  I loved my 1999 so much, my next car had to be the same.  BIG MISTAKE!  I have had this car in to have the roof worked on over a dozen times.  The roof is loud and there is a constant ticking coming from multiple locations.  There are multiple ""loose parts"" in the door that sounds like a hanger banging back and forth and the windows rattle along with a vent on the dash that rattles.  I've had the car in the shop more than in my garage.  They could simply replace the roof (they've taken it off enough times)but insist on trying to repair it with no improvement.  The car looks nice, but it's cheaply built.  "

chrysler,sebring,2005,filigree1, 06/19/2007,Ragtop Love,4,"I bought this car used with 18,000 miles on it June 2006 for $14,000. It was a fleet car prior. I can't say enough nice things about this car. The only negative I could find is that it has some blind spots with the top up, but after driving it a while, it's easy to compensate for them. I intend to keep this car a long time.  The new ones are too small and don't hold turns like this one does. It also accelerates quite well. I know people have complained about acceleration in this model, but all I can say is they probably don't keep it properly tuned. My friend paid a fortune for a Jaguar and he's kicking himself. My car accelerates faster, has better performance, mileage, and road huggability. "

I live out in the boonies in the shadow of the Montana Rockies, and my car has performed flawlessly in temps from 110 to minus 35, always starts instantly, and has never had a mechanical problem of any kind. I have used Mobile One every 5000 miles since new, and it uses no oil at 50000 miles now. Has averaged 28 MPG with 90 % highway miles, and 22 in town, or with the top down on the highway around 20. Great comfort, looks and build quality. I plan on keeping it for the rest of my life. I would buy it all over again."

chrysler,sebring,2005,tom, 02/21/2010,Ok for a first car,3,Had this car for 5 years in december and its been ok not the best car ive ever owned. The first thing that happened when i got this car wa the a/c was dumping water into the back seat! covered under warranty. Then i got into a wreck not that long ago and busted her up pretty good but the airbag should have deployed but didnt due to a sensor failure. The repair work was good but ever since car has more road noise from the back door. The engine has good power but my radiator hose has a leak and the car over heated and sent smoke into the passenger compartment! So far ive put at least $8000(including the accient) into this car. The accident alone was $6000. But a good car over all.

My choice of engine was the Mitsubishi built 4 cylinder with the automatic transmission. Great exterior styling, interior is a little plain and lacking in initial quality, ride is surprisingly quiet/ smooth, and the 4 cylinder Mitsubishi engine powers this vehicle w/ V-6 like performance.  Bad points to date:  Front rotors were warped upon my leaving the showroom w/ this vehicle, as steering wheel and brake pedal shakes/vibrates when attempting to slow down/stop. If this remains to be the only problem that I'll experience w/ this vehicle, only then will I give Chrysler a thumbs up !"

makes for enough h/p for the basic 
driving. I think it will have good-
enough gas mileage for all the trips 
I enjoy. Big trunk, roomy seats and 
cruise control is all I need for a trip

chrysler,sebring,2005,Eddie, 10/11/2008,The car of style,4,"What sold me was the style inside and outside, rear passenger foot room, headlights/driving lamps, and the cornering is wonderful. The 2.7 liter V6 gets the job done for the size of motor and can keep up with most of the 3.0 series engines in the market today. I get and average of 24 to 27 mpg in city and 26 to 30 on hwy which is pretty good for a V6. If you are looking for a great car to have fun in and turn heads this would be that car and a plus is it is affordable."

chrysler,sebring,2005,Oldengineer, 12/05/2004,A Bargain Mid-size Car,4,"I recently purchased an '05 Sebring Touring-Signature Edition.  For the money, Camry and Accord couldn't even get close on price. Quality, fit, and finish are excellent.  Car has the 2.7 V6, giving it decent performance and excellent fuel economy.  Ride and handling are very good.  The body styling is very eye-catching and looks great in a dark blue mettalic color.  The car is very quiet on the interstate and solidy built.  The dash styling, while improved on the '05, still doesn't look as modern as Accord or Camry.  However, since, with rebates and the special package, the car cost about $8k less than a comparable Japanese car, I couldn't pass it up."

Here is a car with the best of both worlds. With the top up, it is a luxurious well appointed and roomy 4 seater coupe.  With the top down, it is a sporty sure footed joy to drive. The engine/transmission combination is smooth and quiet yet responsive. I am also impressed with the fuel economy getting over 31 MPG on the road and 23- 24 around town."

Will take it into dealer very soon, will be able to tell at that point if Dealer is going to be a good one to deal with or not.

Very scary.  2) Has a habit of hopping forward if you do not have the brake pedal pushed all the way to the floor. 3)  Rear axle is very squeaky, especially when the weather is cold. 4) Brakes are very noisy and make noise most every time I brake.

Occational engine noise that no Chrysler Mechanic can find, but all can hear.  Poor service as well.  The drive train seems sloppy.  Had trouble with stereo, which was replaced under warrantee (thank God).  Braking is not as good as I would like.  I would not buy another one, which is sad, as many people stop me and say how nice it ""looks"", then I tell them of all the little things that pop up now and then.  Get with it US Auto Makers.  Stop buying up all the imports and invest your cash in domestic quality up grades."

This vehicle had such great possibilities with the ultra sleek exterior design, if only they would have used some of the exterior's bold new styling for the interior, as the interior utilizes cheap plastic components, a trade mark of Chrysler products.  If you're a tall person, good luck in attempting to fit into this ride, head room is at an extreme minimal.  I'm short, so no complaints here ! The touring suspension provides a nice smooth ride, and the car being so low to ground provides you with sports car handling around bends, etc.  I really like the car though, despite interior design.  I'd give it a few more ponies, re-work interior."

chrysler,sebring,2005,Disappointed, 01/17/2005,GOING BACK TO GM,4,"Had an Olds for 10 years w/NO problems. 
I'm already looking to dump this 
Sebring. While so far it's running 
fine, I've had stupid little things to 
deal with. My odometer light has gone 
out, the cigarette lighter wouldn't 
charge my cell phone and now the 
cylinder has totally come out in one 
piece. To fix these 'little things' 
requires a full dismantle of the front 
dash. Had an idiot light regarding fuel 
come on recently too and reset itself 
after 20 starts. What that was about - 
still don't know. And the horn on this 
car stinks. Can give it a good lean 
while the car is parked and not running 
but try to do that while driving and it 
gives off a staccato toot that hardly 
gets you heard."
chrysler,sebring,2005,Jay, 02/04/2005,Great Little Car,5,This is really a fun car to drive.  I have the navigation system which is a must have.  Sound system (with 6 CD player) is cool.  Convertible top works at the push of a button and have had no trouble with it at all...  This is a real college/entering the work force type car for singles.

chrysler,sebring,2005,Brandi, 02/21/2005,Baby Blue Sebring,4,"This is a very stylish car inside and out, it is very roomy but material quality could have been better. Standard features did not include anti lock breaks which is a probably the worst thing aboout the car. Overall, it is a very fun car to drive. The sebring coupe is very underated. It has luxury styling with a smooth ride for a low price!"

I couldn't wait until the weather warmed up so I could drive with the top down. I wasn't disappointed! Very smooth, comfortable ride-lots of extra features including radio controls on steering wheel, heated seats and CD/Cassette/radio. Good gas mileage of about 26mpg city/highway."
chrysler,sebring,2005,namllits 2002, 07/19/2005,Great car for the money,4,"A very well built car that brings back all the best of convertible cruising.  Reliable, great styling and so easy to 'pop the top'.  It seems solid and is relatively quiet with great road holding ability and smooth ride.  Overall, Chrysler has been building convertibles for so long now, that the Sebring has all the best features you could including a great interior. "
chrysler,sebring,2005,Rancho, 07/20/2005,Primary driver 3 days a week,5,"Love this convertible, my kids loved to ride in it and, I enjoy driving them around.  It's my 1st convertible and I realy had fun driving it.  I have tested other convertible like Ford Mustand, and Mercedes, no room in the back to stratch your legs.  I find the Chrysler Sebring Limited to be the most comfortable for the family of four.  The seat in the front and rear is excellent compare to other convertibles. Under the hood is a powerfull 2.7 liter, V6 engine, lot's of horse power to get us where we need to go. So, just kick back and enjoy the drive. "
chrysler,sebring,2005,Charles Glenn, 08/10/2005,Great car,4,"I'm an insurance agent and travel all over the state visiting my clients.  This car is not only a lot of fun to drive, but it's also a real head-turner with the top down.  Performance is quite spirited, but still gives me an average of 23 mpg.  Great cruiser, as well as being nimbile around town.  The top is easy to operate, and is weather tight, although a bit noisy at high speeds.  Excellent car overall, and I'd be happy to buy another one!"
chrysler,sebring,2005,Emilienne, 11/03/2005,My new beautiful sebring,4,"I just love the way it feels and looks but the negative part is it really compresses when on cruise control downhill, I really thought it would be better on gas but I was told it does get better after usage for a while, overall its a nice car and it sure looks good.P.S.It corners like the neon use to,Thanks for reading me."
chrysler,sebring,2005,Don , 02/18/2006,More than I bargained for,5,"It is relatively quiet for a convertible, has plenty of power and is comfortable and well built. It has had one recall that was taken care of by the dealer very promptly. This is my 3rd Sebring convertible having had a '97 and a '99.  This one surpasses the others in all categories.  The gas mileage is excellent for the amount of power the engine produces. The fact that it seats 4 full sized adults in reasonable comfort is another plus."
chrysler,sebring,2005,Luc, 03/17/2006,Very nice convertible,4,"This is my second limited sebring convertible, I had a 2000 limited and had no problem with it , just 110,000 miles on the counter and  time for a change . It drives very smoothly, the engine is quicker , and noise from the road is much lower compare to the old series , this is a convertible , so expect more noise inside while driving compare to a sedan , but that is all the fun of it ...."

chrysler,sebring,2005,SUV to a Convertible, 06/22/2006,From SUV to a 2 Dr Limited Convertible,5,"I had the top of the line Jeep Grand Cherokee - Laredo -- I kept it for 6 years and loved it.  After an unexpected accident I was forced to purchase a replacement vehicle, and I wanted...at a minimum:  Leather seats, comfort, lumbar support, elecric adjustable seat, tilt steering, good gas mileage, nice looking and reliable. My biggest fear was lack of space of feeling like I was sitting too low to the ground--I haven't looked back -- I love my Sebring-Limited Convertible"
chrysler,sebring,2005,gwhea38411, 07/30/2006,Dissappointed,3,"Beautiful car however, the build quality is lacking. The car just feels flimsy. Don't know if its the design or the craftmanship. Braking is horrible and do not feel comfortable having to brake at speed. What the car lacks in quality it makes up for in appearance. If you must have a reliable car that will stand the test of time, this ain't it but if you have some extra money lying around and want a fine looking car to drive it is. I would not recommend to a friend, just look at all the recalls this model has endured."
chrysler,sebring,2005,happyGoGtC, 08/02/2006,I'm glad its legal,5,"The car is just really fun to drive. For the price it is the best value. Not to mention the top goes down, what a bonus:) Only one draw back I have to put Gas in it to go anywhere."
chrysler,sebring,2005,Kacz, 09/29/2006,COOL CAT,4,"Definitely Fun to Drive.  Roomy interior and beautiful exterior.  Overall, a great buy for the price tag. To summarize it's a classy car at an affordable price.  You actually get a lot for your money.  However, I must say that it took me awhile to get used to the transition from driving an SUV to the convertable.   The children love driving in the convertible more than the SUV but it's not practical for use on a daily basis. The children sometimes have many items that they carry to and from school, sports & other activities which we use the SUV on those days. "

chrysler,sebring,2005,KC MOM, 12/06/2007,Not a powerhouse but smooth ride,4,"After 12 years of driving a Firebird convertible I finally faced the fact it would not last forever.  With 2 junior high aged kids I was looking for a used car with enough backseat legroom for 2 5 foot tall+ kids and a reasonable price, as we will have 2 teen drivers soon so didn't want to spend a fortune on a new car. Looking at Carfax, a lot of the late model Sebrings were former rentals, but was finally able to find a low miles one owner 05 for 10 grand less than new."
chrysler,sebring,2006,tstas, 07/28/2014,Love my Sebring,3,"I've had my 2006 Sebring Touring Edition since August 2011.
I did have to replace an O2 sensor and heat sync sensor as well as the alternator last year.
The car has over 90k on it.
It was under 70 when I bought it.

Mine has handled nicely and is fun to drive on curvy roads with the top down.
Aside from the above mentioned issues I've had no mechanical problems and keep up with routine maintenance.
I'm not getting the mileage some others are getting.
I get maybe 25 MPG city.
All and all, I have no complaints about the car."

This conv. is totally different. We love it. The seating in back is perfect, plenty of leg room for adults. Very fun to drive. It's my wifes car but i drive it 50% of the time."
chrysler,sebring,2006,Michele Hurchla, 02/16/2016,Best car I have owned...love my Chrysler,5,"I have owned nice cars but this car is the top.I have owned my car for about 4 years. I love my 2006 sebring touring. Fantastic car, i love the size not too big or too small. Runs like a charm with normal relacement of parts. Its actually really good in the winter. Safety has airbags all around car. I live in the country and drive mostly highway 22-25 miles per gallon.
Can't really find any negative.  I just hit 170,000 miles and this baby is like the energizer bunny. I'm not kidding. My daughter keeps saying mom why dont you get a new car. I said because I dont need one. I love my car. She sees all the fancy cars out there. What the difference is they have 400.00 car pymts and i dont. I havent had a car payment in over ten years. So I have to laugh when I was younger always thought I needed new car at 70,000 but my Chrysler has proved me wrong. Chrysler please make this same model car again.

Handles really well, easy to drive, fun to be in...get so many compliments on the look and color.
I keep her clean, and when the standard rims are clean, they get so many compliments...stock but ever so sexy.
Been easy on the wallet so far, even with 115k on it when I got it...keep up the maintenance, should be a great ride for a while!!!"
chrysler,sebring,2006,tribalxgecko, 01/17/2013,"Fun Drive, but no reliability",2,"This was a fun car to drive...when it worked. I owned this car for 4 years and had nothing but problems. Started with 20k miles, now has 80k. Repairs include: Starter (2x), Front Wheel Bearings (5x), Rotors (5x), Alternator (2x), O2 Sensor (3x), Fuel Sensor (1x), Heat Sensor (1x), and Wiring Harness (1x). It burned oil, eventuallydeveloped an oil leak. Power steering squealed like crazy, so I replaced the belt and the pump, still squeals like crazy. Headlight and taillight bulbs blow constantly. It now sits in the driveway because my wife is too afraid to drive it. The engine compartment is too cramped to do anything without tearing apart other components...all in all, a nightmare."
chrysler,sebring,2006,Chris, 09/04/2010,Fun Little Car - doesn't break the bank,4,"I love my car!I come from a passion for sports cars, but have learned that cars are a necessary waste of money-so the Sebring Vert is my compromise. It's fun to drive, relatively safe, and thieves don't want it. The car was 6 months old when I bought it with very low mileage -  and certified; for about half the cost of a new one. This was a secret I found out early on, and I am glad I did; why throw money out the window? Cars really are a bad investment, but I don't feel guilty about this one. Its not a BMW or Mercedes, but it gets the job done nicely without sacrificing the fun factor or the family factor. I don't drive much or very far so mpg on mine isn't reliable for comparison."
chrysler,sebring,2006,cak737, 04/03/2011,A great American Car,4,"I bought this 2006 TSi as a leftover in 07. It now has 60,000 miles and has not had the first problem. The reason I bought it instead of an 07 was it was priced right and loaded w/ options, and
Lifetime Warranted. I have a 97 Stratus which I believe is about the same size and frame, it now has 345,000 miles w/ no major problems.
And parts for these are 1/4th of parts for foreign cars.
I consistently get over 30 MPG highway and that's saying something here in the Mts. of Colorado.
It's fun to drive and has very crisp handling, a must in the mts.
Overall a great car.
Just wish the seats had more padding. "
chrysler,sebring,2006,Dawn, 11/05/2015,Dec 2017 SOLD,4,"5/2017
Well for Christmas I got a new car!  I sold the Chrysler for $700, a lot more than the dealer was going to give me. I loved my Chrysler. It was my baby and she treated me well for the 10 and a half years I had her! The only reason I got a new car was that the front end, although I'd had it fixed in 2015, was not going to make another year, or so my husband thought. I'd have kept her for another 10 years if I could have.

11/2016
I still love my girl!  More now than ever, because there is no car payment. Had the hood re-painted in the spring; had the ball joint replaced, the window motor replaced, the power door lock mechanism repaired (someone had disconnected it, not removed) , got a nice wood plank to put in the trunk over the spare donut tire well, and now we are looking at getting the trunk POP SPRING repaired. Other than that, this car is worth every penny I paid! I still love it! My husband is always telling me he wants to buy me a new one, but, if I want a new one, I'll go rent one for a day or two! This car has no technology other than a cassette/cd player and one power plug where a lighter used to plug into, of course, it came with no ashtray and at the time, that sucked for me! But now I am a nonsmoker, so I have no issue.

2015:
I bought in 2007 Apr with 17k miles on it. Overpriced for sure. Have finally paid it off and not wanting to get into another car pmnt.  First thing fixed was the fuel tank...then the drivers window motor...  now it is 10 yrs old since it was built and it needs new passenger window motor and some dumb head removed the interior door lock mechanism so I am having to get that installed as well;  And needs a paint job! The all leather seats were awesome until my husband had to use my car for a few years, so I just bought slip on seat covers. The trunk 'donut' cover broke the first time my husband pulled it out, so need a replacement for that. 
I love this car, rides great and is smooth on the highway. Gas mileage, not so good, about 23 mpg. it is now at 118k and just starting to have some things that need to be addressed like ball joints and steering belt; Firestone replaced the alternator a couple months back...

I just purchased my third Sebring convertible. I purchased them all used with low miles because Chrysler's drop in value so quickly.

I highly recommend the vehicle for numerous reasons but please be aware that these vehicles are know to require more than routine maintenance.

After reviewing all available in our price range, this one by far seemed the best choice -- simply because it's easily the classiest-looking of all its peers.  We've had old Fords and newer Mercedes...my wife has never cared which we drove. To her, a car's a car.  The Sebring Touring Convertible, however, has her coming to my office EVERY DAY to steal it from me or to wait until I get off so we can just drive.  She hates driving in traffic...except with this car (when the top's down).  I'm thrilled.  Wife is ecstatic.  NOTE:  Get the V6. Don't you dare skimp on this.

The only thing I hate from this car is the quality of plastics used for dash & doors. TOO CHEAP ! It's my second car and I love them. The V6 is smooth,the car is very light so 200hp is sufficient for me,for the moment. Fuel efficient is very great on highway but can be better in city. 10km/l (25% city,75% highway).

My last vehicle was a 2000 Sebring JXi, that ran perfectly, but was a tad under- powered. The 2.7 liter engine corrects that issue, and returns better mileage (22-27 mpg for me). The car does nothing perfectly, but also nothing horribly. This is why rental fleets had so many. The car is easy to drive, feels solid, and controls are easy to reach and intuitive. There are abundant standard features, like lighted visor mirrors, ample storage, power everything, roomy trunk, steering wheel controls, suede leather seats, etc. The cabin is tight and quiet closed, and the top and windows drop in 9 seconds flat."

It's the windows/roof/doors that rattle. The rattles are constant. I think it's a combination of 2 things: In Florida I kept the top down all of the time. Lousy city streets. Great car, but if rattles bother you, this is not the car for you. We are trading for a new sedan, as we can't take the noise. Poor build quality. No mechanical problems to speak of, though. noisy."

chrysler,sebring,2006,Dave Kerr, 11/24/2016,Still my fun sedan in my memories..,5,"The only weak point we found was a plastic bleeder valve in the cooling system- Ours broke at 96000 miles and it was a $500 fix ( 70 for the valve but 430 in time) Otherwise we had some warranty work early in its life.  Generally I bought the car on the spur of the moment trading in a Gr Chkee just to get a little better mpg  The car always got compliments- had two tone leather, wood trim, and plenty of reserve power; It handled like my Talon TSI on the road.  While it had all the electronic toys you could get- it quickly began to lag in electronics when I traded it in on a 2013. Now the 2013 lacks features like blind spot warning and variable cruise control and auto stop.  I never regretted the Sebring for a daily driver. We have had over 30 cars-Olds, Gr Chkees; Eagles; Talons;Commander;Vans; 3 Wranglers and the family Cadillacs.  So we have a good base of comparisons

chrysler,sebring,2006,tom R, 01/17/2019,don't believe the bad reliability reports,4,"purchased new.it has been very reliable. one fairly major repair in 12years (replaced cam position sensor-$375) I learned not to have a heavy foot on the  brake pedal after replacing the rotors twice. one complaint- some rust on rocker panels. a few small spots rusted through. the car has always been always garage kept (this is a problem in winter snow when snow on the car melts in the warm garage. road salt won't affect metal unless moisture is present causing rust. another complaint- chrysler dealer charges for maintenance are high. I paid well over $1,000 to replace timing belt and water pump when required. also the car isn't taking rough roads as well as when new, could use a set of front and rear shocks, although all in all I can't complain

chrysler,sebring,2006,C,Faith,Very nice reliable family car,4,"Had my sebring for 2 and a half years now put many many miles on it and it still runs and sounds new!  The head room is a issue for tall people,well actually im only 5'7 and i bang my head alot on the roof,so that maybe a good thing to consider.  Odomotor lights are green if maybe they made it abit more sporty it would be perfect.  The seats in the back are not the greatest but hey thier seats,right?  Over all love the car,safe and reliable"
chrysler,sebring,2006,Patrick, 01/12/2010,Good Car For The Price,4,"All I can say is, ""So far, so good!""  I purchased my Sebring used with about 69,000 miles on it and I can say that I have had no problems with it.  Shifts well, great gas mileage (I have actually calculated it consistently at 32 mpg on the highway), and very sporty styling.  The 4 cylinder does feel a little underpowered... I wish I had the six after driving for awhile.  I would sacrifice some fuel economy for a little more horsepower. Not a lot of fluff.  If you need a large passenger compartment, but want some fuel economy this is a good car to consider. I'm happy with it overall."
chrysler,sebring,2006,katie1nel, 03/26/2010,Gorgeous Car,5,"I love my Sebring!  I've had her for over 2 years now and have never had any trouble with her.  The interior is roomy, I'm 5'10"" tall and have no problems hitting my head.  It came with Eagle LS tires and I switched to Michelin Destiny.  It reduced the road noise dramatically!  Truck is nice and big, the back seat is roomy and I like having the option to put the seat down in the back.  I get compliments on my car all the time!  Glad I got the 2006 model, the 2007 and later model isn't all that attractive to me.  Thrilled with it!!"

chrysler,sebring,2006,Vince, 11/07/2007,Sebring Convertible,4,I've only owned the vehicle for a few months (it was a present for my wife) but I've enjoyed the simplicity of the dashboard and the leg room in the front. I can't wait until the spring to put down the top on a regular basis. The cost versus other comp. cars is what impressed me along with the style of the car. It's sleek and not boxy. More like on the jaguar line.

I had a few minor adjustments to make during the warranty period, the driver's window and the rear defroster (both under warranty, of course) this car has been steady and reliable in the 16 months I have owned it...

chrysler,sebring,2006,sloroller, 01/29/2017,giddy up ah... go,4,"We have the GTC model which has the sporty front end and hugs the turns nicely and does not sway. I put some self stick weather striping across the  top at the front so closure would quiet the wind draft. It worked. Everything is ok about the car except for the quick stop and the quick start which it can do sporty but It seems the torque converter can't find the right gear to catch the engine at  the sudden drop of  the higher rpm then gassing it quickly. I have always thought that a 5 spd transmission could solve the problem. So we don't do any Hollywood stops and let the car come to a complete stop before hitting the throttle.

Don't get me wrong, for the price we got it at was a good deal but the ride quality sucks and the seats are uncomfortable. It feels like you're riding on a skate board and the transmission shifts like a standard instead of an automatic. It rides and operates like an older Honda from the 80's"
chrysler,sebring,2006,Thirtysomething, 09/24/2008,Reliable but has problems,3,"I purchased this car from Enterprise Car Rental Company in Plano Texas when is was still considered a new car. It has been reliable, but noisy. Sounds like a helicopter flying over my head constantly. I am hard of hearing and wear a hearing aid. When I am driving this car on the interstate it is hard for me to hear on my cell phone because of the noise. The a/c condenser is creating too much water, it is leaking into the passenger side of my car and it drips onto the serpentine belt and squeals. The fuel econ sucks and very little power. I also own a 2003 Pontiac Grand Am, it is more powerful and gets better gas mileage. Plus, it was a pain to replace driver headlight bulb It went out twice!"

The only drawback is the air noise on the highway-the top seals could be tighter! Good sound system and fun to drive. I bought it for my wife, but I liked it so much, that I drive it most of the time commuting to and from work. Only serviced at regular intervals and no performance or service problems. I am looking for a newer one. It's one of the BEST convertibles that I have owned."

It is more solid and drives with less floting than the older model.  I am glad I did not let my sence of design be the only thing that ruled my purchase.  My husband is a big man and fits better in this car.  I love my car.........."
chrysler,sebring,2006,dale james, 01/22/2007,"Joy to own, suprise!",5,"I bought this car for driving to and from work. I thought a convertible might be fun.

Center console storage is bigger than my 95 Mazda 626. Good sized trunk with place for full sized spare. A/C is nice and cold. Remote trunk release is nice too. All around - I'm pleased.

chrysler,sebring,2006,Shane, 04/27/2007,Seemingly Reliable Car with a lot of go!,4,"I purchased this car used with 19,000 miles and have to say it still had the new car smell. Handles and drives well. 2.7 liter v6 engine has a lot of pep and takes a minute to get use to the jumpiness of the throttle, however this is a plus once you get accustomed. The sedan is sharp on the outside with nice big wheels and sleek lines overall. The interior feels solid and reliable to me with lots of space and high end farbric bucket seats. I like the chunky radio buttons and the standard sound system is quite good. The interior is dated but the finishes seem reliable as a result. Engine builty by Chrysler- Mercedes so very reliable."

The engine is not built very well. It is noisy, lots of lifter and valve noises. Sounds like it is going to come apart. Trips to the dealer have proved useless I was told that they all sound like that. My next car is going to be a Toyota or a Honda. I would not recommend Chrysler vehicles to my friends"

chrysler,sebring,2007,Lyle / Sonja , 11/28/2006,2007 Sebring is full of Sexappeal,4,"It's love at first sight with this car. The exterior design is sleek,smooth,and seductive. The '07 Sebring is right at home riding along side any other luxury sedan that you may encounter while riding around town. Once my wife and I sat inside the car we found it to be comfortable for our size(I'm 6'3/225) and it still leaves room for our girls in the back .Easy to read instrument panel and easy to reach dash controls. Driver seat manual controls for the base model are adequate,and the 2.4L engine rates about a seven getting on the interstate. The steering is tight and moves when you move and the gas mileage is excellent.I would recommend anyone to take the sebring out on a date and enjoy the day"

chrysler,sebring,2007,gigigilari, 03/18/2011,Make sure you check Chrysler recalls before paying for repair,3,"I got my Chrysler in June'2010 with 68k....not even 2 weeks and it needed new alternator...later on during the summer i had to take my daughter to the hospital and on the way out it didnt want to shift from Park. Now its shaking when slowing down and its doing horrible on gas. I did tune up, regular oil changes, changed brakes and rotors and still shaking.
I see a lot of people are having the shift from Park problem!!!! DO NOT pay for fixing it- go to chrysler dealership and they will fix it for free- thats a recall, also this same model has a recall for the stalling.....so if you have a problem check first because it could be a recall so u wonat have to pay or worry about expired warranty!!"
chrysler,sebring,2007,VRT, 12/15/2006,End of the boring Sebring...,4,"I'm a proud FORD owner, however my family works at JEEP and I get the EC discount. I leased my Sebring for 159 a month and the 2006 model is VERY boring. This 2007 model grabs from the 300C and the Crossfire. Its very affordable. The people that don't like this car because they want BMW or AUDI style and performance and want to pay like a KIA. Seriously give this car a try, this comes from a FORD person. FYI go for the V6 its much better!"
chrysler,sebring,2007,sfm, 12/13/2006,2007 Sebring,4,After driving a van for the past 7 years it was nice to go back to a sedan.  We love the look. It is sporty and the front seat sits higher than most sedans.  For being a small sedan it gives the driver and passenger plenty of room.  I am really pleased with the overall performance of the car.  It doesn't feel like the 4 cylinder engines I was used to.  
chrysler,sebring,2007,Brianna, 11/20/2015,Save Yourself The Trouble!,2,"I have the 2.7L V6 engine. Let me start by saying i haven't had many problems but the problems I do have are ridiculous. As previously mentioned by others, the car randomly stalls out on you whether you are moving or not... Especially in the rain! It is absolutely horrible on gas. My gas cap seems to be an ongoing issue as the car chooses when it thinks the gas cap is working properly and when it isn't... I've been through 2 or 3 gas caps so far. I've gotten water stuck in the door during a rainstorm which drained out over the course of a few days. If you're looking for something that handles nicely and is good in all weather, this is absolutely not the car for you. My car slides all over the place when it's wet or icy out... I dread driving it in the winter. I've had to replace the brakes twice in 6 months because they don't seem to hold up well and this car takes what seems like days to stop. I LOVE the acceleration in the car though! I must conclude by saying the car is 100% plastic and I was recently in a very minor accident (rear ended another vehicle) and the front of my car SMASHED. $4,500 in damage. Cosmetic parts are entirely too expensive for such a horribly made vehicle. The airbags also did not deploy. I could go on and on about why I hate this car but my advice to you is to skip out on it and look for another vehicle!!!

Took it to several places to get fixed, spent thousands of dollars and still not fixed. The gears get stuck in park, sometimes the keys don't want to come out of the ignition, so make sure you have a spare.. And just recently I've discovered that when it rains water gets inside of my doors. Do not waste your money on this car!

some issues:
Air bag light on- replaced clock spring.
""Throttle position sensor slow response"" trouble code - engine oil below check rod added 1.5 quart to see in the check rod - thick and dirty. ($19 oil change 2 month, 1K mile)- code reappeared after 2 days - Changed the oil in the dealer- trouble code went away. 
No start and no power in trouble code reader- replaced fuse no 27 with fuse no 3. Engine started but NO GEAR SHIFT. Put another fuse in no 3.

Never know what noises I'm going to hear each day. Kind of fun to drive but so noisy and uncomfortable it's hard to get past anything else. Please ask if you can take car for a few days and drive before you buy to make sure it's what you want. Wish I would have. Not fun just sick to my stomach that I'm in this car for a long time. I wish I could hire someone to run it off of a cliff.

At around 100,000 miles put in new brakes, new bushings and control arms, its ok, thats all I have done. Performance has been excellent, not a single problem with the engine. Windows stopped working at 140,000 miles, a minor fix, no big deal. I have been good with the maintenance, treat it good and it will treat you good.

Way too many problems. There is a long list. I believe that I have had 3 alternators within 3 months of having the car. I would not recommend it. I don't care what other people are saying about it.

Check engine light has come on for several things including O2 sensor and cylinder misfire.
The recirculate door for the AC flaps for 60 sec upon hitting the button.

We needed a good value (kid in college expenses!), 4 door, & found a mint, Chrysler off-lease, loaded Sebring Touring. 73,000 km. Power train warranty to Mar 2012! So far, 34 imperial mpg on highway (better than our V6 Camry). Cruises effortlessly. Nice firmer ride, but not harsh. Camry was mushy."

I drove to Atlanta from Michigan and back with no problems.
The engine stalls when it rains every now and then but Chrysler is going to fix that for free.
If you're going to buy this car I would make sure the dealer has taken care of said recalls and that the engine is in good shape, from there just maintain it well and it will be a great value!"
chrysler,sebring,2007,mwdummer, 02/07/2018,Great Deal,4,"I just purchased this car about a week ago.  Fortunately, the previous owner kept very good records on service and... any ongoing ""issues"" he was having.  After looking through the service records, the majority of the problems that he dealt with were with the instrument cluster not lighting up, front tire wear, and lastly MPG.  The instrument cluster was replaced while under warranty which resolved that issue.  The unusual tire wear was taken care of by a wheel alignment and all four tires were replaced (again under warranty).  The MPG (Miles Per Gallon) issue which turns out to be a non-issue as the former owner lived in Chicago which is a lot of stop and go traffic. In the week that I've owned the car, the mileage is up to 27 MPG of Highway driving- pretty good for having the 3.5L V6!!!   The one issue that I don't really care for is that the leather seats are very slippery!!!  But....after paying $4500 for a 2007 with 35,800 Miles on it, I'm not going to complain.   Overall a good deal!
"
chrysler,sebring,2007,william, 09/08/2015,would never buy a Chrysler product again!,1,"My car (2007 base model Sebring 2.4l) was the worst purchase ever!
I bought my 2007 used in 2011 with 94k. First appearance was great! Very specious, decently large trunk, excellent sound quality from the speakers, sharp interior and exterior, minimal road noise. Everything cosmetically was great for a compact car. The first two years I owned the car I did regular maintenance which include a new starter, new tires, breaks, alignment, new belts, air filter, oil changed with synthetic oil every 3000 miles. After the second year everything went down hill.
First was the car would shake when I traveled on the freeway and lightly tap the break. It was so dangerous I had to pull over immediately! I was told first by a mechanic that I need new breaks and rotors. I purchased new breaks and rotors which cost me around $300! That wasn't the problem it ended up needing new break calipers which are 150 a piece i needed two.After that I had a coolant leak I needed new clamps for the hose. That was a $40 repair.  The fluids had to be constantly observed especially the coolant. this car had a coolant problem the entire time I owned the car.the breaks needed to be replaced every couple of months! Then the engine failed during winter which cracked the block which lead to me purchasing a used engine with 66k total installation cost 2000. Chrysler dealership wanted to charge me 2000 just for a used engine so that forced me to go else where. The engine failing also lead to the heater coil failing which lead to no heat! With was a 1000 dollar fix OUTSIDE the dealership. The a/c control would not stay on high. The interior no matter how many times I got it detailed would never stay clean the stains just soaked in the fabric. After that my car kept making a loud popping noise when I turned the wheel, then I took it back to the mechanic and it was the complete hub assembly  which cost me over $300 dollars. Then the back door stopped working from the outside . The antenna  flew off. The headliner fell down. Then I thought I could at least get another year out of the car. After 20,000 miles from when I changed the engine, the car over heated blew the radiator hose. Then I had to get it towed to the mechanic where he replaced the hose the part was 55.00 not including labor, he checked the head gasket, compression test, checked for air in the line, replaced both thermostats in the car that cost me over 300 dollars. And it still didn't stop over heating. It would over heat at idle and go back down when I drove it. Also at this point the car had 164k and the linkage kept sticking and transmission was slipping. Plus I had to replace at least 5 sensors on the car  Finally the mechanic told me he recommends selling the car which I did. I hardly got any money for the car I practically gave it away since the car depreciated so much.
Just a reminder I did a full carfax report the previous owners also maintained it ever 3000 miles and the car has never been in an accident.
Chrysler should be ashamed for putting a car with this many problems on the market

chrysler,sebring,2007,cadillacjack1, 06/13/2013,It's all about the drive...,4,"I've owned my Sebring for about a month now.
The ride quality of this car is among the best I have experienced. Where the rubber meets the road-where handiling meets performance, this vehical is solidly built. fun to drive Economical to own.
I removed my factory plastic hub caps and opted for a set of stainless steel snap on covers.
Painted my grill black- tinted the windows,and removed a section from the air inlet and have increased my horsepower;suprisingly, and it only took about a minute.


The Sebring is a bit of a plane Jane as looks go..but with a bit of flash-she stands out nice in any crowd.
As I understand from reading many reviews.
a good car to own."
chrysler,sebring,2007,Newmzedo, 11/28/2006,Bought this car and HATE IT!!!!,2,"I bought this car 3 weeks ago and absolutely hate it. It's the worse piece of crap I have ever rode/drove.The seats are cheap and very uncomfortable, and there is little if no leg room or hip room. If you are over 5 5 forget you have no head room. I feel very confined sitting in this car.The dash is made of this nasty cheap plastic with a silver tin accent and looks like hell.The moon roof is not very big compared to my other car and even thou I have the 2.7 v6 engine it is still sluggish. The head rest in the front seats are at an awkward angle so that you feel like your head is constantly being pushed forward. Its gas mileage is very good.  Chrysler should dump this and bring back the 300 M"
chrysler,sebring,2007,Trisha, 07/18/2008,Better than I expected,4,"We own a Ford Freestyle Limited and wanted something smaller like a Camry. I travel a lot and needed better gas mileage. I was amazed when I test drove the Sebring. So glad I did, it is great on gas and sporty! I had only owned Toyota's (2 Camry's, 1 Corolla) and and one Ford (which we still have)...I love this Chrysler. My two daughters are anxious to drive it when they are old enough - they liked the body style as much as I do. This car has been better than I expected."
chrysler,sebring,2007,Tracy, 08/31/2008,2007 Sebring Touring,3,"I leased my Sebring when they were brand new to the showrooms.  It was a great car that handled well, has great features like Sirius satellite radio, 6 in dash CD player and most importantly UConnect.  I found it so much easier to use than the Trailblazer I had.  The four cylinder engine had more than enough power to take us where we were going and in the year and a half I had the car, no problems to report.  The greatest concern with the car is safety.  The car was in an accident which rendered it a complete loss.  The car was hit head on and the air bags never went off.  Thankfully my children weren't in the car but I did suffer chest pain from hitting the steering wheel.  "
chrysler,sebring,2007,love my sebring, 10/29/2008,MY BABY!,5,"I went to a Nissan dealership, and drove away with a Chrysler. I'm a college student, wanted to get something I wouldn't have to pray would break down on me. Test drove a few Nissans then I test drove the Sebring, and then took it home.  I love the way the car looks.  It's great on gas, and the sound system is great. People have been complaining about the pick up,  I think the car is quite peppy, and when I'm on the highway I don't even realize how fast I'm going sometimes.  The inside feels sorta like a airplane cockpit, but I love my car ! I love the gas mileage it rivals a Honda, or Nissan . Not bad for an American made car"
chrysler,sebring,2007,imcd, 02/02/2009,very nice,4,"i have had this car for almost 2 years now. when i was first going to buy a car for my wife i test drove many other models in the midsized sedan market. this one stood out for a few reasons, a great stereo and a long list of features this is the touring 2.4 liter model. first anyone who buys a car for reliability doesn't love cars or even car, they just want it to run so don't right a review. this car has had not had a single problem. don't drive it like you stole it and service it and it shouldn't. this car was cheaper than any of the other makes and looks way more expensive. it has more features and if you aren't reviewing the car like ze Germans then then you realize this is a nice car"
chrysler,sebring,2007,ItsGabrielle, 07/27/2010,Please save your money or be a mechanic,4,"I got this car 3 weeks ago. The price was GREAT but I didn't get it from a dealership as big as Chrysler. We drove it out of town for a family reunion about 2 hours away, the gas mileage was great. BUT the uconnect call system is faulty. I can sit in my living room and the car will pick the call up and when I try to jump into the car to talk I see that it's on mute, but there is no mute button in the car to unmute it. It has only been 3 weeks and the car shakes when I slow down everywhere! I hear that they have small rotors that need to be replaced. I haven't made my first payment yet, I get off from work today and my gear is stuck in Park. There is no simple fix. The part is $200"
chrysler,sebring,2007,FORD LOVER , 08/10/2010,Great price/needs help!,3,"I bought this car because of the body style and how it drove, like a luxury automobile.  I had it only 3 days and the gear got hung in park.  The dealership fixed the problem and I can only pray that it doesn't happen again.  I love the comfortable ride. air conditioning, Sirius radio and the body style, but after reading all the other reviews, I'm wondering if I should have bought another dependable ford product.  I owned a Ford Focus with 106,000 miles on it and it was very dependable, no problems ever.  I'm prayerful that God will allow this to be a good purchase and not have the problems that others have had, if not than I will return and update my information to others so they will know!"
chrysler,sebring,2007,Jeff, 11/07/2007,2007 Sebring Limited 3.5L V6,4,"A Sebring wasn't even on my next car list several years ago but the redesigned 2007 changed all that.  I bought the 3.5L V6 for better performance and, combined with the 6- speed autostick, it doesn't disappoint me.  I think it has every option except the moonroof, which I didn't want anyway. I love the Inferno Red color with the chrome accents and the interior with the MyGIG navigation system looks sharp.  Little things like the nice, solid sound and feel of the door closing tells me it's a quality built car. It is so quiet and smooth on the highway."

chrysler,sebring,2007,Michelle, 06/06/2008,Watch Out! Pretty car but bad performance,1,I bought this car with less then 100 mi.  Started having problems 2 days after I took it home. Had problems with the check engine light- had to replace the PCP.  Had problems with the sunroof/spoiler. The car makes noises when you start it and power steering make cluck noises when you turn corners.  Took it back to the dealership for the 8th time but they say these problems were just the way the car was built. Please don't buy this car unless you want a noisy car.  Looks nice from outside but the engine sounds very loud.  I just recently noticed a gaping crack where the bumper meets the rest of the car.  Looks to be pulling away.  Back to the shop it will go!!
chrysler,sebring,2007,Cate, 12/11/2006,Should have put better quality inside,2,"The engineers at Chrysler should have taken a little more time in over hauling this car.  More thought could have made this car more elegant.  The interior could have been made a little less retro disco era and they could have give us  more leg room and more comfortable seats.  The 2.7 engine has no get up and go.  They could have easily had to options the 4 cylinder or the other 6 cylidar, the 2.7 is not necessary.  Also the moon roof could have been a little bit bigger.  Being that the 300 M & Concords were eliminated, they really could have done better with the quality."

chrysler,sebring,2007,KnightKF, 08/24/2010,Too many issues,2,"I got this vehicle while I was pregnant thinking it would be a good family car. The paint was chipping from the beginning and the dealership refused to fix it. Had to have the gear shift replaced because it got stuck in park. I have had multiple issues with the power windows, and and power seats. Recently I was in a wreck and the passenger side was hit and the side curtain air bags did not deploy. I will never own another Chrysler vehicle."
chrysler,sebring,2007,kim porter, 07/26/2008,Watch out for electrical fire,3,"I was just getting used to the car, driving it back and forth to work, one fine day on my way home, I stopped at my local home improvement store, I got out of the car, and walked into the store, within minutes my car had caught fire. So be careful there is something going on with this car, that Chrysler has not recognized as of yet. If anyone else has had this problem please call Chrysler and inform them of this problem."
chrysler,sebring,2007,Regina, 08/19/2008,Water problems after rain,4,"I purchased this vehicle a few weeks ago.  Just got my license plate yesterday.  I already want to return it.  I love this car, especially the way it looks. But I'm already experiencing problems. Twice the ignition made a sound when cranking as if the starter was getting ready to quit on me and the brakes makes a funny noise only when I'm backing up.  Now today it rained while i was at work and i hear water swishing around in the back, my husband says it sounds like it's coming from the back passenger door. It sounds like a LOT of water, not a little. Although i'm under warranty i think i'm going to return it and find me something else.  Beware of the Chrysler Sebring!"
chrysler,sebring,2007,jpassare, 11/28/2008,Good so far!,4,"I purchased my 07 Sebring new, and put 25K miles in one year. In this time it only needed one minor fix to the trunk release. I have the 2.4l 4 cyl, and no issues with pep. I'm a bit surprised by some reviews that report lack of pep. I travel a lot, and have driven many rental cars with 4 cyl. engines. I don't think any of them have as much go or more power than my Sebring. On the highway it's quite and handles far better than I expected for the price I paid. On one recent highway trip I got 35 mpg doing mostly 70 mph. My only concern is if Chrysler will stay in business to honor the life time power- train warranty that came with my car for no extra cost! "
chrysler,sebring,2007,Fran, 12/09/2008,Not A Very Good Car,2,"I got this car as a company vehicle last year July 2007. I have the 2.7L V6 engine. I must say, the car is very stylish from the outside but basically, car is a piece of crap! I took this car in several times to the dealership for various repairs. Problems that stand out for me is the following - Car dies intermittenly at low speeds. When making left turns, car makes a growling noise. At stops, sometimes car sputters, then surges forward when foot is on brake. If you don't have to drive it and leave it parked the car get 10's all around. Once you drive it the car gets 1's all around! I will never ever purchase a Chrysler product. No wonder the 3 big American car companies are going out of business!"
chrysler,sebring,2007,oliver, 01/13/2009,Something to consider,4,"Do not get me wrong this is a really good car, the only issue I have with it is the brakes. It seems that the braking system is not strong enough for the car, now that might be how they make cars today, but its not smart. I found out that I needed brakes (at around 10,000 miles) when I went to stop and the vehicle did not want to and then you heard a horrible grinding noise, only to find out that there was nothing left to the pads, they had worn down with no notification whatsoever, some saftey light would have been nice. Just something to consider."

The battery died twice, and the stereo shuts off and turns back on by itself. The dealer said there is nothing wrong with it."
chrysler,sebring,2007,Joyce, 04/01/2009,UnReliable,2,"Car stalls randomly when stopped.   Dealer can find ""nothing"" wrong.  Car occasionally drivings at 5000 RPM when doing only about 60 MPH.  Again, dealer can find no cause, says there is ""no code"" so they can't help you.  Offered me the option to turn it into the bank or use it as a trade (less than 1 year later for greatly less than I paid.)  Would NEVER purchase form this dealer or this car EVER again."

chrysler,sebring,2007,Chris, 05/18/2009,2007 Sebring,3,I purchased this vehicle used a year ago and since then had nothing but nightmares. After a month of having it the shifter was stuck in park and had to be towed to dealership. They had the car for a week because the part was not in stock. The engine sounds very whiny and the brakes make alot of grinding sounds. Now with 40k on it the alternator went out on me. I have been calling around and told it would take 3-7 days to get it in and the cost is almost $400. When I called the dealership and asked why this car is having so many problems they said I have never heard of them having any issues. I would never buy a chrysler again.
chrysler,sebring,2007,Mopar424, 01/05/2008,Most comfortable ride,4,"This is simply a beautiful car, inside and out. Meant for being a boulevard cruiser rather than a racecar. Got the touring with every option except leather, and got the 2.7 V6 for the E85 capability. The engine, while somewhat slow, sounds really nice and refined, and the four speed shifts without making a fuss. This is by far the smoothest car I've ever driven/riden in (it is my dad's primarily), and 90 feels like 40. "

The only thing I have needed for this car has been the maintance! I did have the rotors turned at about 25000 miles, but besides that, this ""AMERICAN"" car has been great!

In the six months my wife has had this car, the serpentine belt has been replaced three times, the air conditioner compressor has been replaced twice, the gear shift stuck in park when she parked on a slight incline, the front bumper has separated from the panels above because it is attached with flimsy bolts. The panel under the motor is missing, probably fell off on the highway somewhere. The interior is cheap plastic, noisy when it idles. Chrysler has been bailed out twice by the American taxpayer. Why? They can't sell junk cars.  "

I have serviced it oil every 5000 rotate tires and get 32 hwy and 22 city. No problems  except the rotors replaced at 12000 under warranty, gave me a loner for the day.  Sirius radio is great. Handles in snow and rain wonderful,plenty of pickup getting on the expressway, love the styling and get compliments on it all the time.  Its not a sports car, or muscle racer and but a daily driver so treat it as such and this auto will be very reliable."

First in less than 1 year there were 2 recalls on the car, than just a few months a go the check engine light went on and now just 2 days a go it started over heating.  I took it to the dealer but they couldn't find anything.  This car is full of surprises in less than 2 years now and I am fed up with this.  This might be the worst car that I ever had with this kind of problem.  I only drive 30 miles a day and things like this is kinda considered stupid for Chrysler.  Don't buy this car it only looks good but bad performance.  "

Great gas mileage 32 hwy 24 city. Very reliable, good acceleration on exprssway for 4 cly auto. Handles great snow rain.

From what I seen on this site dealerships can not figure it out.  I Bought this car new so I would not have to deal with a care breaking down, because I thought it would be better to make payments on a new car instead of constantly repair an old one.

Routinely driven on mountain roads, it handles well. Millage ranges lowest 17-highest 38.  Typ 19 - 26  Reasonable power.  Mechanically, the 2.4l engine offers excellent accessibility in the engine compartment, better than my first car - a 1959 Chevy.  Easy to change oil and spark plugs.  All major engine components and accessories easy to inspect.  Dealers addressed minor quality issues, defective door window regulator, leaking seal on transaxel, 3 instances of stalling corrected by dealer based on a service bulletin. The body style is not appealing but its good safe and efficient trans portion."

Had to replace the brakes, etc. and then the gear shift mechanism just snapped leaving me stranded.  Now I seem to have a wiring issue so I have no power outlets and they can't find the problem. Now I have to replace the pulleys for the serpentine belt.  I really like the car, it's fun, great looking, great air, good stereo system and is comfortable to drive anywhere.  Just unusual things go wrong and I didn't purchase an extended warranty due to financial issues at the time. Next time I will and I would buy this car again. My mom owns a 2008 Sebring."

The wheels that came with it had a plastic kind of cover/finish on them. Looked good but started peeling away last fall. Chrysler put four new chrome ones on it & let me keep the old ones for my winter tires. Only other thing was I didn't like the way the lumbar support in the seat, even when fully deflated.

chrysler,sebring,2007,Daniel, 06/08/2010,I should've bought something else,2,"The Sebring line was first introduced when I was a teenager. I've always loved the style of the car and heard good things about them. After I got my first real job, I bought my first new car, at the time though I decided on a pickup instead of a Sebring. A couple of years ago - I saw the newly designed Sebring and decided I'd get it this time. I have regretted it since the first fuel pump replacement within two months of driving it off the lot. Since then, the thing has been in the shop to get the ECM and TPM system replaced, took three tries to hold an alignment, has random electrical problems, and most recently got stuck in park for no apparent reason. This has been a disappointment."

Very sporty looking and for a 4door family sedan, when paired with the 3.5 V6 and 6 speed automatic, you tend to forget your driving a family vehicle. The engine is whisper quite and provides plenty of pep around town and on the highway.  Be careful 80 feels like 40. This is my third Chrysler in a row. Before these last three vehicles I was exclusively a European car buyer.  I was originally in the market for a Pasat or Audi A4, but the value in the New Sebring Sedan was too much to pass up.

Then I drove one and fell in love with it. It is a lot of car for the money. I just don't like to buy anything but American and this in my opinion is the best mid-sized American car for the money. I liked the 2.7L V6 in the Touring with it's E85 capability and the 18-inch wheels are definitely a plus.  It rides like a much more expensive car and it very quiet on the interstate when cruising at 82mph. I am very happy so far with 522 miles driven, hopefully many more."

I was afraid of getting a 4 cylinder; but decided to go for it for the mileage.  I have been happy to find the pickup to be wonderful.  I highly recommend it to anyone who wants good looks and great performance."
chrysler,sebring,2007,steve, 10/11/2007,Great buy,4," I felt this was a great buy. I was looking for a good solid car that was good on gas. Being a Chrysler minivan owner I was a little more inclined to be less harsh on the product because I had such good luck with my van. But with that said the Sebring surprised me on looks inside and out. The equipment I have on the car that listed for $22,400. So far it has exceeded my expecatations  "
chrysler,sebring,2007,erik, 05/26/2007,Good car,4,It feels like you are driving a car that costs a lot more. The ride is very smooth. Acceleration is very good for a four cylinder. The trip computer reads as high as 35mpg. But I calculated mileage myself and I'm getting 32.5. I drive 90% highway. 
chrysler,sebring,2007,Ted, 06/28/2007,2007 Chrysler Sebring 2.4L,4,"My first full tank of fuel averaged me 37 mpg. That is way more than I expected. I like this car for its solid feel and good handling, inside trim, non glare dash, side air bags. I feel the seats are too small and too firm, the engineers should   be required to test drive for at least a 300 mile trip and that would insure better and more comfortable seats. The engine is noisy going through gears while accelerating but at highway speeds I do not hear it. The trade off for the fuel economy is well worth it. Buy the car!"
chrysler,sebring,2007,DAN, 08/29/2007,Awesome Vehicle,4,"Chrysler has completely outdone themselves with re-designing the 07' Sebring. There isn't much leg room in the back seating area and the sound system wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Other than those 2 minor things.. I absolutely love everything about this car and if you're thinking about purchasing one.. don't think any more. Go out, get your best price and buy it!"
chrysler,sebring,2007,MARGARET, 09/05/2007,2007 Sebring touring vehicle,3,"The car is very roomy. The gas mileage was a major factor in purchasing the vehicle. Gas mileage averaging around 27 mpg, that includes city and highway driving. I got the touring model. First front wheel drive vehicle I owned, I like it. I would recomend this vehicle to family and friends."
chrysler,sebring,2007,Chris, 09/16/2007,2007 Sebring Limited,4,This car is a significant improvement over the last generation.  I have the 3.5 V6.  It is super-quick and fun to drive. The seats could be a little more comfortable. The gas mileage isn't as great but I wanted the big engine. I like the four-door Crossfire look and the interior design. The Limited is worth looking into if the wallet will let you. Fit and finish could be a shade better but overall an excellent car.  
chrysler,sebring,2007,mike, 11/09/2007,Fantastic Car,5,"We decided to give the Sebring Limited a try as a midsize. The major imports we looked at seemed to be getting bloated and were just plain boring(No spark). The car is just the right size, has great styling and handles extremely well. Twisty roads are a real blast with the precision steering and suspension.  The 3.5l engine has lots of power and has a pleasant tone when you get your foot into it.  We've had the car for about 4 months now and it has been trouble free.  The build quality is excellent and the interior design is pleasant and unique with high quality material.  The seats are very comfortable.  We're expecting great service out of this car like our old LHS, +100k and no troubles"
chrysler,sebring,2007,MikeInCA, 11/17/2007,An Economy Luxury Vehicle,3,"The 4 cyl Sebring is an attractive if somewhat basic car. The interior is well designed and presents well. It's cruise control, remote entry/trunk release and power locks/windows/mirrors provide the basic luxury you'd expect, but that's about it. The MP3 stereo is a nice touch. The MPG is as advertised. There is a recall on a part that can cause a high pitch whine while driving, though its not advertised anywhere (my car has 24k miles on it). The 4 cyl is surprisingly spunky, offering some thrill factor, but not off the line. The 2007 Sebring 4 cyl offers basic luxury in an attractive package for a reasonable price. In today's gas market, it's not a bad alternative to the V6's."

It is still under factory warranty as it only had 19,000 miles on it when I got it. Carfax had no bad reports on it at all. I am concerned about the electrical problems as they have had to replace the battery & 2 different electrical modules with the low number of miles on this. I am wondering what else might happen. It was a one owner car from Alaska & there are no records to see what problems they had. Do you think I might have a lemon? John"

I took it for a drive I seemed to really like the feel of the car and was really impressed with the car for the price. What a mistake. I have had nothing but trouble. I have had 4 water leaks in my car, and I don't mean little I mean about two inches of water in there. After the fourth time of this they think they have it fixed. My air conditioning has gone out twice and my blinkers blink even when they are not in use. My windshield wipers are tearing up my windshield for the third time as well. I know you are thinking oh she just got a lemon well the dealer said this is about the 15 car with the same problems.  "

On the highway very nice cruiser. I have no problems with the 4 cyl pickup is fine. Heater stereo excellent, seats are firm, but I like that, I commute on the thruway with three main mergers and power is fine. Great in the snow. Traded in a Saab 9.5 glad I did."
chrysler,sebring,2007,RON, 04/27/2008,Great buy,5,"After test driving the following vehicles Dodge Charger, Chevy Malibu, Hyundai Sonata, Mercury Milan (twin to Ford Fusion), Nissan Altima, Mercury Sable, I decided on the Sebring. Reason: best ride for the money.  More substantial with better drive and road handling than the Sonata, Milan or Altima.  The Charger and Sable are the only ones that could compare to the Sebring. The Charger is very solid but more money and less MPG. The New Sebring introduced in 07 is far better than the old Sebring with improved ride and handling.  I purchase the Limited with the four cylinder 2.4 L engine.  Good power for a four banger and far less noise that the Altima. "
chrysler,sebring,2007,Picky, 05/02/2008,Pleasanty impressed,4,I was toying with buying a used luxury car and decided to look at a new lesser model.  I was impressed with the options this had.  I drive a long way to work so the gas mileage was a huge plus.  Didn't really care too much about the lack of pick up.  This car has just as much options as the used luxury car I was going to get without all the miles!
chrysler,sebring,2007,Superior Car, 12/12/2007,Superior Car,4,"I own a 2007 Sebring Limited V6, and I absoloutley love it. This is my first American car, I have allways owned Eurpoan vehicles and I like it much better than European or even Japanese. Exceptional audio system by Boston, way much better than Bose!! "
chrysler,sebring,2008,sebringdriver, 01/15/2014,Best car I've owned,4,"It's been nearly a year since I've purchased this car in 2013, and I've had so much fun with it.
The design is truly classic, and although nearly six years old, it still looks very current compared to other cars of it's age.
I'm a tall guy- 6'7"" and I fit with no complaints.
I've even ridden in the back seat and was still comfortable, although the top was down at the time.
The overall maintenance is very affordable, (knock on wood)
I haven't had to do anything that wasn't routine.
My one minor complaint about the car is the interior finishes, it appears Chrysler skimped on the quality, although it is still nicely designed and has an easy button layout.
Overall the best car I've owned."

chrysler,sebring,2008,Doug, 09/18/2016,Truly a CLASSIC,5,"The 2008 Limited Hardtop convertible is a classic. It is fun to drive and has plenty of performance. I would like to add that the performance and handling of the Sebring improved greatly when we installed a set of General Altimax RT43 tires. The previous tires made the car harsh riding and were very noisy. The difference was amazing! We get great mileage on the road 27 to 28 mpg. We live in the country so almost all our driving miles are on 60 mph roads. With the windscreen up the car is quieter with the side windows down. I have had many convertibles including a 1958 Morris Minor and the Sebring is by far the best.

chrysler,sebring,2008,Carnut, 09/26/2008,Sebring Hard Top Convertible,4,"Great vehicle!  With current incentives it is a great value and lots of fun to drive. Great new features with the MyGig system and navigation.  I typically own and drive BMW, MBenz and Porsche, but this car gets me more compliments.  If you don't need the high-end performance of the MB CLK, then you can get all of the fun and features at half the price!"
chrysler,sebring,2008,Wayne Kopp, 06/04/2010,Love my Convertable,5,"This is my first Chrysler product and I love it.  Before I bought my convertible, I read the reviews and they were bad.  I loved the styling and ride and room and was sold.  The ride is smooth, the trunk is roomy and the back and front seats are very comfortable. I'm impressed with the gas mileage and just plain love driving it.  Now that I have read the reviews of the owners, they agree with me.  What do these professionals look at, I don't know?"
chrysler,sebring,2008,idav, 02/19/2011,Great car,4,"I have the car for 2.5 years now and so far it does what it supposed to be , a fun car with more interior room then almost any convertible on the road. i dont understand why the car have bad reviews, you cant compare it to Mercedes or BMW but i can buy two of them compare with their price.
currently 43,00O miles and done only regular service."
chrysler,sebring,2008,George, 08/15/2009,Still going topless!,4,"I've had my Sebring convertible a year now, and my wife's had hers eleven months. I've done about 10,000 miles and my wife has done about 6,000 miles on hers.  We love the way they drive, their fuel economy, their styling and their huge trunk capacity.  On a recent long trip, my car with four people in it, plus luggage,with the top down averaged over 31 mpg doing parkway speeds!  My wife's car with the six, regularly does 25+ mpg.  These cars are sure footed performers both in nice and in nasty weather.  They are GREAT cars and we believe they've not received the good  credit that they deserve from the professional reviewers and others.  I've driven 44+ yrs. and should know!"
chrysler,sebring,2008,CindiT, 01/24/2010,Love My Sebring!!!,4,"This is my second Sebring Convertible. I had a 06 Touring Cloth top and upgraded to 08 Hard-top Sebring Limited. My husband and I love to lower the top and head out on pretty days. Our kids are grown and this is Mom's car. I have the I-connect system for hands-free talking. Great economy on fuel and retractable hard-top is so easy to use. Great looking car inside and out. Trunk is spacious, but there is still room to pack dufflebags/carry- ons to travel. I get lots of compliments on the look of the car with and without the top down. I love the fact I can download my CD's to the music system 20g hardrive and not worry about storing them in the car. Just pull up the Jukebox and pick your music."

Every time I fix ""something"" 2 months later there's another $500 problem.  Like so many others have stated I need to get rid of this car A.S.A.P.  By the way Dodge/Chrysler's are known for having transmission problems so think about that the next time you consider buying from them."

With all of the incentives out there, I decided to trade it in for an '08 model. Here's some comparisons: - '08 model rides higher, which is nice. - '01 model had a notably bigger cabin - both the front seats and (especially) the rear seats. That said, the 08 is still a comfortable, smooth ride. - The V6 engine in my 01 Sebring had much better accleration. The '08 2.7- liter V6 is adequate, but the difference in power is palpable. - The 08 model has tighter handling and a better turning radius. On balance, the 08 Touring model is a tremendous value. It's a sharp looking, comfortable car with great features. "

I drove a 2000 Sebring jxi for 8 years and loved it so much I knew I had to have another one.  I have since purchased the 2008 and love it even more!  The style and feel of this car is wonderful. When I'm behind the wheel I feel like a queen. (teehee)  Seriously, this is such a great car for the price and in my opinion THE best 4-passenger convertible on the road!  I love the power and surge of the V6.  Will never go back to a 4-cylinder. And the radio? Hmm - to die for! Notice I didn't talk about the mechanics/engine/gas mileage.  Don't care.  The car is AMAZING! Just trust me on this."
chrysler,sebring,2008,Lolita Greene, 07/09/2008,My sexy experience,4,"I think the car is sleek and sexy and made for a woman. However, it is a heavy car. The doors and trunk door are heavy. I have had minor problems when the car is riding at a slow speed it jerks. I think an improvement would be to add a place to put your sunglasses when your top is up and they are not on your face( sexy shades is a must). Something to protect the glare off the touch screen when watching a movie. I really love my car is was a gift for my 40th birthday and I am constantly turning heads on the road. The hardtop convertible is like having two cars in one."
chrysler,sebring,2008,Robert J., 07/09/2007,Surprising quality and performance,4,"This is my third Sebring convertible. I had a 1999 and 2004. I am happy with the build quality, fuel economy and performance so far. I have owned the car for five weeks and have driven about 1800 miles. This is a base car and the 2.4 liter four is close to the Toyota four in smoothness and lack of noise. On a short trip (220 miles) on 2 lane highways with a number of rolling hills (not mountains) I got 27.5 mpg. The city mileage with the AC on is about 20 so far. This is not a fast luxury sporty car, but especially for the money I am very pleased so far."

chrysler,sebring,2008,jo_ann81, 06/10/2010,Would not recommend!,3,"I bought this car because I liked the looks - unfortunately I didn't do my research ahead of time.  This car has some very strange 'quirks' that the mechanics have no explanation for.  The transmission shifts very hard sometimes and sometimes the car sputters and almost dies as it's shifting between 1st and 2nd (automatic transmission).  I could deal with this problem, but for about a year now sometimes the car will just not start.  I'll turn the key and nothing happens, then take the key out and try again and it starts right up (usually).  Dealer can not figure out the problem.  So far it always starts eventually, but makes me a nervous wreck!  We'll be trading this one in very soon!"

Just washed and waxed,and vehicle with white paint still gleams like new. Now that sun is out, I dropped top, no problems. Paid $12000 for Touring model in Feb, 2009, now worth about the same price or possibly more. No regrets. May turn out to be one of better automobile purchases, even if it does suffer some future breakdown. For now,EVERYTHING is good. "
chrysler,sebring,2008,Jim Snyder, 06/25/2019,A suprisingly great car for the price.,5,"I resisted the 2008 and newer, being enamored with the older Sebring convertible body styles (1999 being my favorite).  I settled on the 2008 after some online research, and with absolutely no regrets. It rides like a coupe, not a convertible, feels very solid. I love that the top lowers or raises in under 30 seconds with a single push of a button (latching or unlatching automatically) and that I can lower the top from 50 feet away using the key fob (I never have to get into a hot car on a hot day). I love the illuminated entry when unlocking with he key fob, and the way the interior lighting fades gracefully when locking with the key fob. These are luxuries that would not have come with the 1999 Sebring. This car is my daily driver to the office, a 40 mile round trip over Tennessee backroads, so I really appreciate that I can go top down every day with so little effort.  For my purposes the 4 cylinder engine performs admirably. After 5 months of owning this eleven year old Sebring convertible, I am quite pleased.

Only one problem, can't drive with windows down, sounds like helicopter. Something to do with the wind and aerodynamics. Its in the owners manual.  Drive with the windows up. I loved my sebring soo much I bought a 2008 sebring, its maroon.  I have finally found a car that I will continue to buy.  It's a nice sporty family car. I feel very safe in it. "
chrysler,sebring,2008,Ed, 11/27/2010,I like the car,4,"I think the Sebring gets a bad rap.  I am a salesman so my car is my office. The car handles nicely in rain, snow, or dry highway and I get 36 plus mpg on the Interstate doing 68 mph. The 4 cylinder is all the power I need. The only problems have been the radio (replaced twice) and the turn signal assembly had to be replaced. I put OEM Chrysler 300 17"" Chrome wheels and a chrome grill on which really dressed up the car. Currently with over 65,000 miles, I'd recommend it."

Issues include, brake lights coming on intermittently, starting getting stuck, front- end/steering noise, stuck door locks, stalling, recalls and interior fit issues. I am currently working with Chrysler assistance to get rid of this vehicle as I feel the front-end problems make it unsafe to drive. Also, it is not worth now what is owed according to KBB.

I had to have the passenger seat replaced because the plastic handle at the top kept breaking the cable in the seat and they couldn't get it fixed without replacing it. Now the driver side plastic handle is broke and needs repaired. The only thing that really bugs me about the car is it isn't worth half of what I paid for it. I can't even trade it in if I wanted too without being upside down. I don't see me buying another Chrysler product. The one really good thing is the looks you get when driving it.

Good room for four adults and good trunk for a convertible. Radio and CD changer work well with excellent sound. Before purchasing drove a Toyota convertible, used with 10,000 miles and a $25,000 purchase price. Frankly the cars were comparable in all respects exept Toyota was faster with larger engine.

Acceleration is decent but seems to be slower than it really is because of the smooth ride. Even though the cabin space is bigger than my '97 Sebring ragtop, there is less front & almost no rear legroom compared to the '97. The fit & finish of the interior & the materials make the car look retro-futuristic. As for the design, it is comparable to the Japanese cars.

Problems with the temp control. No matter what position, it would suddenly blast full heat. It had to be moved to full cool to cancel max heat. 12 V plug too close to shift lever in P. Seat back spring is too powerful: releasing lever makes it slam forward. Engine loud at full throttle."
chrysler,sebring,2008,Wayne Kopp, 12/05/2008,I love it,5,"We bought our car to take to Florida for 2 months. It has great styling, looks sporty and the seats are very confortable. I was extremely pleased with the gas mileage. The best feature is trunk space with a convertable. The back seats are very confortable. This is my first Chrysler in 43 years of driving many cars and models and I am very pleased.  Have had it for 1 year and no problems at all. "
chrysler,sebring,2008,Tony, 06/14/2010,"Nice Car, Nice Price",4,"I bought my 4 door, limited, 4 cylinder a little over a year ago. I was surprised at all the bells and whistles I got for the price I paid. The engine does fine, no thrills but lets face it, how much power do you really need to get around town? I completely disagree with the terrible reviews it gets from various editors. The car is a great value and delivers more than many of its competitors. I was looking at Fusions and Altimas, the Sebring was far ahead in almost every trait. Exterior design is sharp; it looks like a much more expensive car."

chrysler,sebring,2008,jagsjones27, 12/30/2007,Love This One!,4,Bought the hard top & 3.6L V6 Limited. It is as quiet as you'll get for a convertible. A trunk & back seat area that is actually functional. The fuel mileage is off-set by the fun.
chrysler,sebring,2008,KPH, 06/03/2008,Disappointed,3,"Although I like the exterior look of this car, the quality of parts and interior is lacking. My wipers have been stuck on intermittent for 3 months, the remote for the top has worked twice and quit, convertible headliner started to fall out, and now the steering wheel is making a noise. I have been waiting for parts for the wipers for 3 months. Embarrassing when the top is down and the wipers come on every 10 seconds. I miss my 300C."
chrysler,sebring,2008,Never Again!!, 06/27/2008,Beware!,3,"I loved this car when I saw it.  It has great features BUT 2 days after purchase I had a U-Connect problem, it has been serviced 5 times and in the shop 12 out of the 30 days that I have had it so far. I wish I had read these reviews because no one is lying here. They really need to start over with this car. Technical support is no support, no one seems to know the resolution.  This was my first convertible and now the excitement is gone. I am stuck with a lemon I do believe. After reading the other reviews I guess I will have many more additional problems. That's just great! "
chrysler,sebring,2008,Abby, 09/05/2008,What's with the bumper?,4,I have had this car for about 3 months and in general I love it.  Like the review below mine sometimes it doesn't turn over when starting like it should. This happens randomly and for no apparent reason.  My only major complaint is the rear bumper. I think it is made poorly and within the first month I noticed a rock had hit the underside of the tire casing and made a notch in the paint. After closer inspection I noticed that there is another part where the paint is pulling away where the metal body and plastic bumper of the car meet. You can hardly see it now but I fear in time it will grow. My biggest suggestion would be to examine your bumper before purchasing this car!
chrysler,sebring,2008,George, 10/19/2008,Silver Beauty,5,"Two months ago we bought a red LX model of this car with  a 4 cylinder engine. We loved it so much that we bought this one. It has more standard features, but is no less fun to drive. We've had no problems with it, and it's powerful, well made, smoothly running car.   "
chrysler,sebring,2008,Disappointed, 06/17/2009,Very Disappointed,1,We had numerous issues with the car since Oct. 2008. My husband almost got into an accident because the car stopped on him. The mechanics said a piece flew off something inside and went into the motor. Pick up the car on my way out of town the car stops again and has a really bad burning smell. According to the mechanics not the same problem. Car always seem to want to shut off when you are in stop and go traffic.  Driving and heard a noise like a belt or something was about to pop or something was off. Took the car in the mechanics had to change numerous parts. Pick car up from being repaired it shouts off while we are driving it at night. Shuts off steering wheel locks hit sign. Nt reliabl
chrysler,sebring,2008,robert, 01/27/2010,New Owner,5,"Just bought this about 3 weeks ago and my wife and I love it. Looking at all the reviews made me hesitant at first but once I drove it, WOW!. So far so good. Super quiet ride, great sound system, love the interior lighting!  My only complaint is that I havent owned this sooner. "
chrysler,sebring,2008,Mike, 06/21/2010,Gas sipper,3,"Have had this car (LX Convertible; 2.4 L 4 cyl) for 3 months. Gas mileage is unbelievable for a vehicle this heavy.  Maybe a little under-powered; acceleration isn't the best, but once I'm on the open road on a long highway trip, if I set the cruise around 67 mph, I can count on getting 32 mpg or more...I've been as high as 36.5 mpg.  I traded my 2002 Sebring Convertible GTC (2.7 L, 6 cyl) in for this one -- the GTC was a lot lower to the ground and more stable, a little more sporty, the LX handles more like a sedan. It's a little top- heavy. Still a cool car though."
chrysler,sebring,2008,CB, 03/17/2008,Wish I Never...,1,"I should have have bought a Toyota. This car has 0 power, extremely loud road noise, sounds like the windows are always cracked open. Only reason I got it was wife love the look. Mileage terrible. Hard to say something nice about this car except its pretty on the outside. Consider carefully before purchasing this car. "
chrysler,sebring,2008,Dan, 04/02/2008,"Solid, Stylish Car - With Great Milage!",5,"My new Sebring has been fantastic.  It's great to know that you can get a car with such good mpg in a package that doesn't look or feel like an economy car.  I'm averaging over 30 mpg (about 80% hwy) without crawling along the freeway. The Chevy Malibu gets a lot of press, as do the Japanese competition.  But for the money, I think the Sebring is underrated, and overlooked. The Limited or Touring with Leather is the way to go.  Definitely adds a feeling of luxury, without breaking the bank.  Don't be afraid to stick with the 4cyl.  You'll be hitting the gas pumps less!"
chrysler,sebring,2008,MyJohnny, 05/16/2008,Would not recommend,3,"I purchased my vehicle in June 2007.  2 weeks after purchasing the automatic top got stuck in the up position.  Could not be driven.  Had to put it on a flatbed and have it towed.  Ugh!  2 months later, the exact same thing happened.  Had to get it towed again, in the rain!  Since then, I have had two recalls on the relay switch for the same problem.  While I love the way the car looks, I would NEVER recommend anyone to purchase.  During this past year while having the car, I have never been able to really enjoy the vehicle, since every time I put the top down, I close my eyes and have to pray that it doesn't get stuck again.  Also, does a lot of sputtering.  Never could find the problem."
chrysler,sebring,2008,PhillyPa, 08/16/2007,Be Careful of The Convertible Top,2,"I have had this car for two months and 3000 miles. It's left me stranded twice so far. When putting the roof down, the trunk did not close (twice now). Roadside asst. will not tow it with the trunk open. You have to drive it very slowly back to te dealership with the truck open like a sail. I've been waiting two weeks now for parts to have it fixed. I also have a 2001 Sebring with 122,000 mile and had no problems with it. Needless to say, this model is a huge let down so far. Hopefully, I won't be too far from home the next time it breaks."
chrysler,sebring,2008,Tylor, 12/14/2018,Miss my sebring :(,5,"I am posting a review after i totaled my car. I’m so sad to have lost this car i had it for 5 years and put over 65,000 miles on it and i had zero problems with it. It always started right up in the minnesota winters and never died out on me. It had a lot of life left. If you’re lookimg for a good car and a reliable car this is the one!!

chrysler,sebring,2008,shannon, 05/13/2010,Wish I Never Purchased,1,"This was by far the worst car I have ever purchased. I have nothing but problems with this car. The blinkers dont work correctly, when I turn on the blinker the wipers come on. I have gotten it looked at a few times and still does the same thing. Like it has a mind of its own and I already had to replace the shifter on it. I could go on about problems I've had with this car. Not a good buy at all..sorry Chrysler"
chrysler,sebring,2008,Richard, 02/05/2009,some real problems,3,Beautiful to look at  Hardtop has operated a-ok although it is in the garage having up dates done to top right now Ride is good on smooth hardtop roads but rattles and bangs like a piece of junk when the road gets rough. Gas milage gets whats advertised Dealer service is very expensive 10 bucks for a spark plug is kinda steep.Good fit and finish I love the electronic transmission
chrysler,sebring,2008,David Miller, 04/03/2018,stylish ride?,4,"The clear coat paint on this car started pealing about 3 years after we had the car. Contacted Chrysler, they said couldn't help  me wasn't under any warranty. They said it was because we were parking the car outside. I politely told them I have a 1966 Plymouth Sport fury  that has always been parked outside and the paint has never peeled. Also have a 2005 Chrysler P/T Cruiser that has always been parked outside and do not have any paint peeling problems. So if you want a car that looks like it has leprosy them by all means buy one. You would think a $40,000 car would not have this kind of problem. But if you want one that looks good years down the line I would not suggest this car. There are other things but I am not going to go into them. This is the major one.
"
chrysler,sebring,2008,glad we bought it, 07/06/2008,Great Milage and comfort,4,Just bought it and am very pleased with our choice. On the first trip bringing it home we got 40 mpg with Canadian gallons. The 2.7 liters have  enough snap and yet holds onto the economy. The visibility is great. The interior is bright and easy to enter and exit. The controls are convenient and easy to understand. Having gone from a Jeep Grand Cherokee to the Sebring we had some reservations but to this date we made the right decision.
chrysler,sebring,2008,Mark T, 07/21/2008,A great cheap car,4,"Still have my 2002 Sebring, 180,000 mi, runs great! Was somewhat afraid to buy this car after reading reviews, but in Real World Driving ( I have to pay for it, put the gas in it, and Not get speeding tickets) I went ahead and am definitely more than pleased. Great mileage (ave. 32 mpg, mostly hwy driving) lots of room for large people, great power seats, and everybody loves the looks. As for the interior, yes its a bit 'hard' in spots, but in my experience I've found that in the long term, Chrysler interiors hold up very well. The four cylinder has adequate acceleration, and is dead quit on the highway. I think for the price you can't beat this car. "
chrysler,sebring,2008,Good Car, 08/01/2008,Good Car Not Fun Car,4,"I bought this car 7/25/08 fixed it up a bit but not totally. A 7 speed Manual Transmission will be added. The car has averaged 35.3 MPG. during break in period which is not bad.I did not buy this car for fun. For fun I drive my 1972 Triumph TR-6, Test drove through rental outfits a day each, Honda and Toyota small and same sized cars, this beats them hands down. I drive with windows partly open and never listen to a radio since 1995.I listen to the car I am driving. This car holds the road.It is a gas saver. I think I will keep it quite sometime, too bad Chrysler hasn't promoted this one more, they really should."
chrysler,sebring,2008,Tami, 06/24/2009,2008 Convertible,5,"I purchased a 2008 Stone White Sebring LX Convertible.  Love it!  Has the 4 cylinder, and i drove it through the Ozark Mountains here in Missouri with no trouble at all - and that was with the top up, the A/C blasted, two passengers and a trunk full of luggage.  It is comfy, cool looking and is a real head turner!!"
chrysler,sebring,2008,George, 01/23/2010,Keeps me happy and with a smile!,4,"There's no better convertible for the price anywhere.  Anyone who complains about this car is nuts, unless they have had mechanical troubles  Convertbles are not for those who want to live inside a bubble, and if one  wants all the comforts of home, they should remain in their living room!  When the top is down who cares about the dashboard or the plastic trim? And, if the car were to get wet inside somehow, as all do in time, isn't it better to have things the way this car does?  In the winter it holds the road, and its trunk is huge when the top is up.  Nowadays everyone is spoiled. Be real,I remember when convertibles were bare bones w/ the metal frame exposed under the top."
chrysler,sebring,2008,anita_9410333, 02/26/2010,cute,4,"I bought this car back in the late summer of 2009. It had 32,000 miles on it. So far no trouble with it. Rides very good. Being in my early 20's its an attractive car, with plenty of room for friends and family. Enjoyable car."
chrysler,sebring,2008,Mike, 04/14/2010,Great car!,4,"I really don't understand the ratings this car has received. Maybe the folks that do the evaluating would prefer a cherry wood dash like those in their Bentley's. Either that or I am just uncommonly easy to please. This car is a fantastic value. I have taken several trips with it and consistently get 37-38 MPG. It is easy to drive, has plenty of passing power and is comfortable and reliable. The exterior design is very stylish and I find the interior to be both attractive and functional. My wife is the primary driver and she loves the car too. You can nit-pick this vehicle apart, if you choose to do so, but, for the price, I think it's an incredible value. Not a bad warranty either (lifetime)"
chrysler,sebring,2008,leolady, 05/20/2010,Fun Car But Has Its Issues,3,"I love my car & cannot emphasize that enough. It's such a fun drive, but it has its flaws.  I knew more about the car then dealership from the reviews I read, so I knew the car (could) have its flaws. It has been in the shop many times for a new car: entire top panel had to be replaced because passenger side lining was cut short & falling down, driver side lining replaced because car leaked when raining, the windows sometimes don't go up all the way & the car makes a loud grinding noise with left turns. Most recently, the dashboard lights randomly don't work in the dark-electrical shortage.  Love the car & will have fun, but when the warranty is up, so am I."

chrysler,sebring,2008,C. Brady, 06/05/2008,I've Been Pleasantly Surprised,4,"I turned in a 2004 Toyota Solara SLE V-6 and was concerned about going to a 4 cyl. While the V-6 was quicker and quieter, the Sebring is not too bad. The car, so far, has been proving a good investment. Mileage has been 27 MPG in a 60-40 mix. (highway-city)"
chrysler,sebring,2008,Roger, 07/04/2008,Like if more than I thought I would,4,"I made the switch to the Sebring Touring from a 2002 Jaguar X-Type. I was purely looking for reliability and economy. So far I have both. In mixed driving the car is getting an average of 28 miles per gallon and over 30 mpg on the highway. I couldn't be happier with that. The car has nice features, but not the luxury I was used to. Even so, for about 21,000 sticker price it is a good value. The engine has plenty of power, although the transmission is not very smooth. Overall, if you're looking for an economical midsize car, I recommend at least test driving a Sebring."
chrysler,sebring,2008,zomo, 07/12/2008,Outstanding Convertible,4,"Purchased my first convertible 1 month ago and have covered over 1,000 miles. The 2.4 engine is quite and economical; averaging 30 mpg (55% highway/45%city).  It's got plenty of power for all around cruising.  The interior is fantastic with easy to read gauges and very comfortable seats.  The Sebring has been 100% reliable with every feature/option.  Sirius radio and UConnect are wonderful and the 17"" rims make the car standout.  As mentioned in other reviews, this isn't a hot rod or a sports car - rather it is a solid frame with a comfortable ride & good handling; competitive with any other mid sized car available today.  I truly feel good about owning a Sebring convertible!"
chrysler,sebring,2008,Heather, 08/09/2008,Love hate relationship,4,This is my 3rd convertible. I love it. The problem I'm having is starting the car. It doesn't just turn over like a new car should. It drags while trying to start. It starts every time but sometimes I'm not sure it's going to. The dealership tells me they can't reproduce the problem. I'm so frustrated. Anyone else have this problem? I would love some input. 
chrysler,sebring,2008,Janet, 09/08/2008,Kudo's to Chrysler,5,"We recently purchased a 2008 Sebring Coupe Touring and absolutely love it.  We have been on a few road trips and love the comfort, smooth ride and great gas mileage (averaging 33 mpg).  We love the looks and all of the standard upgrades.  I am not sure why some would put Honda/Hyundai ahead of this (we test drove both) and hands down it is the winner!"
chrysler,sebring,2008,George., 10/19/2008,Going Topless!,5,"We bought this car in red about two months ago. It's FUN to drive and it's economical on gas, getting 32 mpg on long trips over the road.  We've had no trouble at all with it, and we love its styling and hideaway top which is always an attention getter!  The engine runs smoothly, quietly and seems vibration free. There are no body shakes or rattles or squeaks that one usually expects to find, even in the most expensive of convertibles.  Its power won't win any races, but it's very adequate for most situations.  We liked this car SO MUCH that we bought a silver one for my wife!

chrysler,sebring,2008,Commuter, 12/19/2008,Nice Sebring,4,"My Sebring Touring has 4000 miles on it, averaging 30 mpg in mixed suburban and highway driving.  It is a pleasant car with stability control, bluetooth, hard drive Sirrius radio and power driver seat, out the door for $19K. Acceleration is decent. The upright driving position is good and visibility fine. Controls are all easy to reach, and the gated shifter makes it easy to reach the gear I want without looking down. I am using the Sebring as a commuter vehicle 45 miles each way, and my fellow carpoolers have commented without being asked on the roomy rear seat, a real strength of this car as compared to many of its competitors. (I know, I sat in all of them.) No issues so far."
chrysler,sebring,2008,Peter, 02/21/2009,You'll Love It!,5,Bought this vehicle in the middle of winter and just love it!  Sitting in the drivers seat is like sitting in a cockpit of a plane. I bought the hard top and there is no indication that it is a convertible when you drive it. This car is so sexy and gets a lot of looks. The My Gig system is outstanding and there are so many other great options on the limited version. I looked at Volvo and BMW and bought my Sebring Limited hard top because it is better looking and a smoother ride. Go out and get this vehicle!

It has great get up and go, fully loaded, touch screen nav and radio, drink heat/cool, pleanty of room for my two teenagers in the back seat.  Leather is durable for our trips to the beach and my kids clunky backpacks.  I'm in my mid-thirties and I get loads of compliments.  It's wonderful.  Great value as well."
chrysler,sebring,2008,Brandi, 04/15/2009,Biggest waste of money ever. DONT BUY,3,"I bought my car brand new on Jan 2008. The problems began not even one month later when it started stalling on me.  18 months later and many trips to the dealership(along with recalls) the problem still isn't fixed.  Research online about this car and recalls and if you are one of the unlucky ones that have this car, beware- it can stall at any moment causing an accident out of no where. Thankfully mine has only done it while I was either stopped at a light or parked.  Also, press brake hard- if it starts to freak out-it will jump forward and possibly rear end someone."

I love the navigation, and the 'jukebox' style radio - it's great to be able to burn all my CD's to the car's hard drive and not have to load CD's all the time. Great USB plug-in. Love the trunk room. It has enough space to hold 2 golf bags with the top down - awesome! Seats are comforable, and front ones are heated - they heat up within 2 minutes! A/C works well.

Fortunately, I purchased an extended warranty, I needed to use it several times.  I swore I would not buy another one, but I did, I have had the 2008 Sebring converable less than 6 months and already have had it back for service 5 times.  It needs to go back yet again.  Front end noises, leaks, and 2 days ago, it just shut off when I made a right turn.  Less than 7K miles.  I don't recommend the Sebring Convertable. Wish I would have bought the Toyota Solana convertable. Incidendley, no space in the back seat for passenger legs.  I use it as a bench.  "
chrysler,sebring,2008,Lane H., 01/10/2008,All and more that I hoped for,4,"I checked  out all the  hardtop converts before buying and this  is  a much more enjoyable car than i was  expecting . It is a cruiser, not a  sportscar . Comfortable, quiet, and classy! Ride quality is great. All the professional reviews do not give this car justice. I am really glad I got the electronic stabilty control as  we live in the snow and it really makes winter driving safer and easier. This is our everyday car in Minnesota winters. It's a car  for people in their late 40s and up who want a convertible but not all the hassles to go with it. Everyone thinks it is a  Thunderbird, which would be a good comparison if there was such a thing as I can see nothing that compares."

In the first 20 days of driving my Chrysler Sebring LX Convertible the latch on the trunk stops operating. This means that my trunk lid will not close and is unsafely moving about while I drive. Next problem came at a stop light when the car stalledYes, I was completely stopped at a light and it completely shut off. Luckily my boyfriend was driving and he of course knew what to do. I probably would have panicked. Third, it seems that this problem is a continual problem that CHRYSLER (who should be bankrupt from making crappy cars) is in denial to recall to fix. "

With 5-Star crash ratings, stability control and side airbags, you can't buy a safer car! Handling in winter conditions was fantastic, the front wheel drive and stability control performed great. We also like the LIFETIME WARRANTY on the powertrain and plan to keep this car for ten years or more, what a fantastic value! Do yourself a favor and drive the Sebring and compare it to similar cars and I will be surprised if you don't buy the Sebring."

Car rides quiet and smooth on the highway, even at 80. The 4 cylinder is a bit noises taking off, but arent' they all?   One thing I notice is the brakes are squeaky when the car is first used. It goes away after 5 minutes.  I bought an extended warranty for $1185, which covers 45K more miles. Do your shopping on third party warranties before accepting a dealer one. That way they have to compete.  The car looks and drives as nice as my snobby neighbors that have Accord or Camary."

I really do love this car... it's so much fun to drive around with the top down in the summertime, but I've also had no issues driving in several inches of snow.  I had a small leak repaired by the front window shortly after purchasing, and have had no other issues.  I have the smaller engine - not a ton of power, but still enough for me.  I'm really happy with this purchase."
chrysler,sebring,2008,Dezines47, 03/23/2010,Great car,4,"Purchased car as a replacement for my 2000 jxi limited and LOVE IT. A convertible that can take my family of 4 to the beach for a long weekend w/ plenty of room.  I read a lot about it before purchasing and ran it through it's paces before settling on it. the 3.5 has lots of power and gets over 30mpg on the highway with the top down. Although it does get squirrely with the hard top down.  My impressions of this car is with the top up it feels like your driving a luxury car. With the top down, pure sun worship. The biggest surprise was with the hard top up and windows down, I am reminded of the feeling of driving my 1976 Camaro around in the nice weather."
chrysler,sebring,2008,patrick, 04/13/2010,u-connect problems,4,"I love this model-this is my third sebring convertible, 96, 99 and now the 08. However,the u-connect phone continues to dump the stored phone numbers-4 times so far. the dealer replaced the computer, but is still dumping. No one seams to know what is happening."
chrysler,sebring,2008,Perfesser, 06/02/2010,"Great little car, for what it is",4,"It's a 4-door, 4-cylinder commuter car.  I live and commute through the flat cornfields of southern MN.  Boring roads, straight lines, long distances.  This car is perfect for commuting here.  It's roomy, comfortable, reliable.  Okay, so I can't add powerful, but I'm past that.  Once you get to 65, what do you do with all that power anyway?  This is my second Sebring.  I love the styling, and I still have people come up to me in parking lots to comment on how beautiful the color is (glacier blue).   I bought it well, had a few visits back to the dealer to get it sorted out, only one warranty problem since then (power steering went out.)  I'm totally satisfied with this car."
chrysler,sebring,2008,Gazman, 08/14/2010,Best 4 pass Convertible period,5,in any fair comparison this is the  best 4 passenger convertible.  interesting some reviewers didn't realize that holding the up button past the roof up will automatically raise all 4 windows. some compared the 2.7 to the Mustang time was better with the 3.5 so they were probably afraid to do a real comparison. 
chrysler,sebring,2008,Chris , 10/15/2010,3.5L V6 Hardtop Convertible,3,"Black with platinum wheels and trim, the car sure looks classy.  Put synthetic oil and premium gasoline in it, and she flies, too.  Sadly, only 20 mpg in the city. What I thought was flimsy building (the grunts and groans quite a bit), I realized is just how the car is sprung.  Once you drive it a while, it can really perform for you.  All the things they say about the interior are true, and it would have been an easy fix because its really comfy in there, actually.  Also, windshield top is a little low for tall people.  Classy rig.  Ladies in Palm Springs love it.   "
chrysler,sebring,2008,Scott Weber, 02/04/2008,"First Convertable, Love it!",4,"I was absolutly in love with this when I ordered it. After a few months I still love it but it's not perfect. With the hard top, when it rains, the water tends to flow along the edge of the seam by the front part of the roof and off the sides. So when you open the door you will get wet. Not a big deal for me but I could see other people having an issue with it. It requires two hands to put the seat back. This is stange...you have to lift the level with one hand and push the seat back with the other. The spot between the windsheild and hood tends to collect leaves in the fall. The engine does have nice pickup except when you first start it...sluggish. Everything else is great!"
chrysler,sebring,2008,ed, 02/16/2008,Surprised,4,"I have a Touring Sedan 2.7, a car generally cross-shopped by consumers looking in the 4cyl Accord/Camry price range.  Edmunds leaves this model out of the pull down menu.  This car is what I have long appreciated in my Hondas; the ""we make it simple"" principle. As an example, compare the Sebring's three knob HVAC controls to the mess of buttons that now plagues the Accord.  The Sebring has an ultra rigid body and the touring suspension has the travel and damping required to navigate America's deteriorating roads. The 2.7 touring model is a very capable driver too.  The seating position is excellent and support good posture. Boston sound is superb and when it is off, the interior is silent."
chrysler,sebring,2008,GENE, 07/19/2007,NEEDS SOME IMPROVEMENT,3,very poor on gas milage I am averaging on 12.5 mpg. their should be a valet key to lock the truck and glove box.The remote key fob does not always work to lower the top.The u connect voice system is not very easy to work it does not have a good voice recognition.
chrysler,sebring,2008,RJO, 08/17/2007,Fun to drive,4,Got mine on june 19 - now has 4500 miles- top's been up and down a hundred times and it works fine. It is a hard top. Got 26.1mpg on a trip on interstate highways and around town 20 to 22 mpg. It is a fun car 2 drive and the top going down turns heads. I put two carry golfbags in trunk w/top down.
chrysler,sebring,2008,convertible Len, 07/11/2007,The Best Sebring Yet,4,"Having owned a 2005 Sebring with an anemic engine, I decided to buy the new 2008 Sebring Limited for the 3.5 engine and the 6 speed gear box and am I glad I did. This car has good power and handling and is certainly a great improvement over the last Sebring I owned. I also do not like the hard top, so I found the rare cloth top Limited to buy. I have standard antilock breaks plus positraction, and electronic stability control options so the car is very solid, quick off the line and handles very well It us a very solid car. It does not 'swim' all over the road. Overall, it is a really fun boulevard car to drive. I love using the key fob to start it from 35 feet or drop the top.  "
chrysler,sebring,2008,BanjoMan, 08/13/2007,No hyperbole,4,"This car is not a sports car. However, I found previous claims of severe problems with handling to be gross exaggerations. Even taking sharp right turns at speeds higher than I should have I did not encounter excessive body sway or tire squealing. Steering was well behaved under almost any conditions. On straights the car was quiet inside with the cloth top up, and engine noise was noticeable only upon high acceleration.  Power was more than adequate. The seats are well formed and comfortable, even the back seats. I like the car."
chrysler,sebring,2008,bigo, 03/08/2008,Worst mileage I ever had,3,"Bought it to leave at our condo in FL.  Has about 600 miles on it now and I have filled it up four times already. My 04 Vette, 04 Maxima, 04 Jeep Liberty, and 07 Avelon up North all get far better mileage (nearly twice that for all except the Jeep). All in town short trips except one trip from Fort Lauderdale to Palm Beach and rtn. No leg room in back seat. Nice ride characteristics and top operation. My wife loves it though."
chrysler,sebring,2008,Nancy B., 03/20/2008,starting to leak!!,4,"I have had my sebring for less then a week and it is already starting to leak around the ""convertible"" parts to the back windows.  The dealership is going to look into this.    Other then that I love the car!"
chrysler,sebring,2008,CommuterGuy, 03/31/2008,Commuter Car,5,"Before buying this car I looked at many cars for my 120 mile/day commute. Living in FL has many advantages and one is that i get to commute with the top down most of the time.  I looked at many cars including a Prius for this commute, but am very glad i choose the Sebring as this is the most fun to drive car i tried.  With the mygig in the car all my play lists are loaded and at the ready as i head over the Sunshine Skyway with the top down.  Mileage has been a bit better than listed at about 30 mpg, the highway gear helps, and it's nice to have the bigger engine when you need it."
chrysler,sebring,2008,Sam, 05/07/2008,Love the Sebring Hardtop Convertible,4,"The car handles the roads well and highway driving is like riding in a low-flying airplane.  The ride is incredibly smooth with very little road noise. The feel of the car is very solid; not like a typical convertible.  Ive negotiated corners much faster than usual and found that it corners like most other cars that Ive experienced.  The dash and instrument panel is well appointed. The 3.5 is great and the extra power helps handle all kinds of traffic situations.  Top goes up & down 3 times a day, no problems.  Washing is a breeze; I use the drive-thru carwash & have no water problems whatsoever.  Test drive this car and I think you will be hooked.  This car is a beauty; I love it! "
chrysler,sebring,2008,Chrysler Guy, 05/09/2008,2008 Sebring,4,"A real pleasure to drive. Nicely appointed interior although the hard, silver plastic trim is not too classy. Good sound from the standard radio and Sirius radio is a plus. My mileage averages between 31 and 32 for all around driving. Lots of nice goodies; auto headlights, auto dimming rear view mirror, auto temp control, power seats, etc. make is nice to drive and handling is also good."
chrysler,sebring,2008,SirSteven, 05/08/2008,Basically a Fun Car BUT!,4,"I now have 10,000 trouble free fun miles except I had a mygig radio option.  Don't let anybody kid you it is junk! In the first three months I was without a radio for at least two months. It came on when it felt like it. I was promised a software up grade each month. It never came! Finally it got here. They put it in and radio was worse. The installed a new radio. It wasn't new it was a refurbished. What a laugh. It was worse then the first on plus the switched hard drive capacity.  It still didn't work. The bluetooth locked up with the phones and your party could not hear you. The put in another refurbished unit and it again was junk. Now have a new unit from a demo car and it's junk"

It will be 2 years I have had it soon and have had no major problems with the car.  The car is very quiet with the top up.  The gas mileage is not so good with the 3.5l engine.  The design both in and out is sharp.  The plastic used on the interior trim is cheap and shows wear.  The basic radio is nice, but the limited should come standard with the touch my gig dvd/cd radio.  I like my car in all ways except for the basic radio."

chrysler,sebring,2009,William, 02/10/2009,Gas mileage and looks,4,"We bought this sedan after looking at and test driving Honda Accords, Pontiac G6s, Dodge Chargers.  Despite what professional reviewers say this car has a great look on the outside and inside.  The inside is kinda a art deco look and just feels.. classy.  the 4 cylinder is not going to slam you into the seats but it has respectable power and handling.  If you are looking to buy American and get a good looking car that gets great gas mileage, look no further."
chrysler,sebring,2009,alan_qeredaxi, 08/18/2011,Great Car !,4,"Well, Unlike Edmund's review and the other reviews, I could find nothing that looks cheap or of poor quality, but some pieces in the interior looks cheap ! I was concerned after reading negative reviews, but the car has grown on me. I tested some cars in this segment including Toyota Camry, Nissan Altima, Kia Optima ... It was quiet and smoother. but the Altima was powerful than the Sebring with 2.5L engine. Sebring It's what you want in a mid-size sedan, the car is very nice inside and outside, it has a aerodynamic design, smart intuitive, powerful with I-4 and gushes with elegance, and also the seats are very nice and qulaity, among all of those thing, It is very Stable and economic ! "
chrysler,sebring,2009,pheonix5, 06/03/2012,dont walk away run far from it.,2,"Chrysler has dropped the ball and kicked it a hundred miles away with this car.

steering rack failure and all struts and shocks and swaybar bushings.
drive seat motors groans when occupied by anyone over 150lbs.
evap system leaks(bad hoses, bad gas cap), spark plugs worn out at 65000km chrysler says there to be replaced at 170000km.

chrysler,sebring,2009,Lovitt, 11/05/2010,Get the HARDTOP - You'll love it!,4,"Had it almost 2 years, 50,000 miles.  Not one problem.  Rides smooth (VERY American-style), the 3.5 liter engine has good power.  I get 33 mpg combined.  The top goes up/down in 30 seconds - smooth every time.  The interior plastic is a bit cheap (as others have noted), but the seats are excellent.  I have driven this from Miami to D.C and back.  15 hrs each way, and no back pain.  It's a cruiser!  Dead quiet with the hard-top up.  No leakage during a rain or car wash.  In fact, you can drive in rain with the top down, so long as you stay above 40 mph.  The rain flies over you and you stay dry. People look at you like you're a nut, though. Truly fun Florida car. But it's NOT a sports car."

After I bought the cars,I read many many bad things and revies about it,but I found out non of them true,and it's not fair for a good American made car.   The warranty is unbelievable,life time on Engin and Transmition,gas mlg is more than great,the design is wonderful,I read some reviews suggested poor built quality,I don't know about that yet,the car is new now,but I am positive that many years to come will prove it's not true either.

chrysler,sebring,2009,Tetonka One, 09/15/2009,A Beautiful Ride,5,"We purchased the 09 Sebring Sedan, Limited. It has all the options that are available. Unlike Edmund's review, we found this car beautiful inside and out. The seats are soft leather. I could find nothing that looks cheap or of poor quality. We have had several complements in regards to the style and accessories. Prior to this purchase we test drove six other cars. The Sebring was the most fun and best looking. It reminds me of a grown up Crossfire. The sound system is fantastic. The GPS, radio, CD, Telephone are operated from a touch screen. Easy to learn. The V6 is responsive and fast enough. The gas mileage isn't as good as the Ford Focus but we are pleased with 27 mpg."
chrysler,sebring,2009,lewisox, 01/31/2009,The Worst Car Made,1," I have driven both this model and the one it replaces and it seems the quality does down while the usability goes up. This is one of the worst cars I have ever driven and am ashamed to call it an American car. Chrysler should really think about doing the honorable thing and just putting itself (and our taxes) out of it misery. Drive quality = F, Confort = F Build = F. The plastic on the inside likes like it was spray painted with cheap rattle can paint and it chips off with a light fingernail. you need a phd to get the top down, the heater is too hot or too cold. the seats are terrible and there is no back seat. Don't buy this car"
chrysler,sebring,2009,dewhurst, 03/27/2014,Not a good car,2,"I borrowed this car from my grandma when she was out of town for 4 months. During this time, i had to get the power steering repaired twice. Also, I feel like I'm hunched in the car, as the visibility is bad, even though I'm not a tall person. The heated seats are nice, and the interior design is nice. However, now I'm pretty sure I'll steer clear of Chrysler in the future. "

It drives so smooth and has decent pick up.  The look is sharp and it is very comfortable.  I do feel it is ""simple"" in the interior department - not many bells and whistles.  Having said all of this, I did not pay full price for it either.  I was able to get it for under $14k during the cash for clunkers/double rebate from Chrysler.  I do not know if I would have paid $20k for it.  Only time will tell."

chrysler,sebring,2009,David, 01/06/2010,Why Chrysler is Bankrupt,1,"This a horrible example of why Chrysler almost went out of business. This car has little power and was built with the cheapest parts they could find to forestall bankruptcy. The rotors will need to be replaced under 20000 miles. If you need roadside service, be prepared to wait several hours past the time allotted as the vastly reduced number of dealers is completely overburdened by volume of calls from their unreliable cars. Go buy a Ford or GM if you want an American car - you will be much happier in the long term."

I can't believe the gas mileage I am getting, way better than listed.  On the highway at 65 to 70 miles per hour I get 33 miles per gallon.  It has all the bells and whistles, some I will never use.  It is comfortable for my wife and me to travel in.  The motor is responsive for getting on and off the freeway and passing.  The gas mileage is reasonable and we are averaging 28 miles per gallon.  The radio sound is excellent for a car.  We both like it.  I have has the undecarage done, rust inhibiters, cloth stain proofed and paint protected.  Now the car must respond."

Traded a clunker in w 200K miles and with all rebates,discounts, +ttf walked out the door with a 2.7 V6, Nav/Sirius Sat Radio, MyGig/DVD System, Power Sunroof, Heated/Power Seats, Hot/Cold Cup Holder, & Remote Start for $19K.

chrysler,sebring,2010,BuyAmerican, 12/17/2009,Why all the bad press?,4,"Despite the negative reviews I read on several automobile enthusiast websites, I find the styling of the Sebring to be very attractive. The 2010 model year eliminated the grooves on the hood, which results in a much cleaner look. The interior is very stylish with a two-tone beige/cream. The ride is very smooth and quiet and all controls are easy-to-use and where they should be. Apparently the base price has been reduced for 2010; even the dealer did a double-take when they saw the sticker considering the equipment included: heated leather, 4-wheel ABS disc brakes, satellite/6-CD changer radio, power windows with auto down AND up, automatic locks, etc. Overall a very nice car."
chrysler,sebring,2010,limited2010, 10/09/2014,One of the Best I Have Every Owned,5,"I have to say the 2010 Limited Convertible is a great car.  The performance is great, the 6 speed is great, all the bells and whistles are great.  Have 65K on it so far.  Had to replace brakes and tires.  Everything else is working just fine.  Mechanic that did brakes, after looking underneath, told me I will probably never have a issue with this car.  Was impressed.  Told me you can really see how Mercedes influenced this vehicle.  Beyond that most people are amazed its a Sebring.  They are impressed with the folding hardtop, and the remaining trunk space.  The perfomance, the looks, and the toys.  This morning I checked the onboard and it was showing 30MPG. Getting better than expected.

UPDATE: I have had this car for 6 1/2 years.  It now has about 105K.  Everything still works, all the Electronics are good.  The hard top convertible is still great.  There are no regrets for owning this vehicle.  Still one of the best I have had.  A shame they do not still make this car.

UPDATE: Now have owned the car for over 8 years.  Still all is good.  Should note, I did have Chrysler dealer do the 100K standard maintenance.  I still love the car, no problems, just normal maintenance.

chrysler,sebring,2010,itguy55, 02/19/2011,This car is better than the reviews,4,"I recently purchased a 2010 Sebring Limited with the 2.7L V-6 engine.
At first sight I liked the Sebring's European styling cues...It seems these days that every American mid-size car on the road wants to look like a Camry--even the venerable Taurus, and I am just tired of that look.
My Sebring's lines seem to me much closer to an E-Class Mercedes.

When I'm sitting in the cockpit, there's also something very Benz-like about a tilt/telescope steering wheel that pushes almost flat against the dash, which at 6'2"" / 260, I appreciate while getting in and out of the car--I can actually turn in the seat to get out, instead of sliding out sideways, which is what I have to do in most cars ."
chrysler,sebring,2010,tament, 08/23/2011,2010 Sebring Hardtop convertible,5,"This is the best car I have ever purchased.
Mechanically it is sound, I've had it for over a year, 13K miles and not a single problem.
Better yet, however, is reaction from others to a convertible, especially a hardtop convertible.
I live in the northern plains were it gets very cold (-30) and this car was like driving any other car, quiet, warm and sporty in the winter.
Then comes summer and oh man, put down the top.
I couldn't have picked a better car.
My neighbors, friends and coworkers are all envious.
I know this sounds over the top, but that is how I feel about this car.
I could not endorse it more strongly.

UPDATE: Here it is, 2017, and I still love, love, love this car.  My review above done in 2011 is still applicable.  Best car I ever owned.

UPDATE:  Now, July 2019, a guy I know asked me if I was ever going to sell this car.  He said if I do, he wanted first chance to buy it.  Well, I went and did it.  I sold it to him.  Literally the next day he had it in a parade in our little Iowa town and it still gleamed like the day I bought it.  A tear welled up in my eyes, but the fact that I bought a new BMW 428i Hardtop Convertible to replace it made me feel better.  I would have bought a new model of this car, but Chrysler, in fact all American Automakers quit making hardtop convertibles.  My nine years with this Chrysler Sebring Hardtop were wonderful.  Never had a single problem with this car and it performed perfectly.  I will miss it and wouldn't have sold it but for having a ready and willing buyer for it at this time.  If you are in the market for something like this, I could not recommend it more strongly!

chrysler,sebring,2010,Ed, 07/05/2010,Better than expected,4,"Traded 01 Olds Alero. Front seats roomy and comfortable. Rear a bit tight but better than Mustang. With top up and windows closed, much quieter than Olds. With top down and windows up, we were able to have conversations at normal speaking levels. Not much turbulence with top down. Car rides smoothly but tends to wallow a little.  Acceleration is similar to 2010 Mustang but not close to the 2011 Pony. Engine is a little noisy when accelerating, but very quiet at steady 70. Car easily pushes to over 80 without whining. Love the trunk space when the top is up. Very simple to raise/lower top: one switch, no levers. Car sat on dealers lot for extended period with no leaks after many heavy storms."

The 3.5l V6, mated to the 6 speed, is smooth and powerful. The hard top is the best of the 3 that I've owned. Quite, snug, and a huge trunk, even with the top down.

If I ever cmplain about the small stuff I stop and remember the AWESOME price of the Sebring! The only major complaint I have is the plastic in the interior door handles, they stratch very easily. My previous vehicle was a Ford Explorer so I am LOVING the gas mileage. This car rides and drives good and is extremly comfortable. My advice is to test drive this car for yourself!"
chrysler,sebring,2010,Ron, 05/07/2010,Best Bang for the Buck,4,This vehicle with the four cylinder has excellent fuel economy. It is easy to drive and is excellent in the city or as a highway driver. The transmission is smooth. This is an improvement over the 07 Sebring I had.  Chrysler has made it a lot quieter than the 07. This vehicle also has excellent crash test results.
chrysler,sebring,2010,xcap5, 05/23/2012,Still love my car,4,"In 1.5 years I have put 51,000 trouble free miles on this car.
Two flat tires and oil changes is all I've done.
 People sure thought I was crazy buying this car new because of all the bad reviews but I have no regrets."
chrysler,sebring,2010,augrpeters3, 02/04/2014,I love my Sebring.,4,"My Sebring is a Limited with a 3.5 v6. I love driving this car everyday. It has been a reliable, fantastic car to own. I drive about 4500 miles a month and this car has held up fantastically, I have had zero problems with it. All my Chrysler products have been fantastic with this one being the very best. The 3.5 is a blast to ""step on"" and very frugal when you drive economically. I get a very reasonable 26.7 miles to the gallon and I have a very heavy foot. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't handle the ice very well where I live. It cruises at 90 MPH so effortlessly and eats the miles up in no time. It's extremely comfortable on long drives, and the heated seats are top notch!"
chrysler,sebring,2010,RON, 05/18/2010,Great Value,4,"This vehicle which I own is the Touring model. The Touring model is the basic vehicle. However, it comes pretty well loaded. The four cylinder has excellent fuel economy. The ride is smooth and quiet, the seats are comfortable, and the engine produces decent power. It is easy to drive and the 1 year free Satellite Radio Service is great which sounds great. There are no power seats in the Touring model but they are comfortable and has a height adjustment on the drivers side.. "
chrysler,sebring,2010,kmasue, 07/24/2011,POOR gas mileage,3,"i bought my sebring in feb brand new as a 2010
leftover, an althought i got it for a good price, i have very poor gas mileage with it, along with some other issues. For having a 4 cyl engine, and being rated 21 city 30 hwy, i would never have expected to be getting only 20 mpg at best on the hwy. i have called the dealers service department several times reguarding this issue, and have taken it in, an all ive been told is they cant find anything wrong with it and that it must be the way i am driving. i have also written to chrysler corp and been told the same thing. i am very displeased and will certainly never purchase another chrysler."
chrysler,sebring,2010,Mike, 08/02/2017,"It just keeps going and going, 130k",5,"I bought the Sebring new at the loss leader promo price in the newspaper. Still have it after 6 years, still looks like a new car and just passed smog with flying colors. Being a base model, not much in the way of technology, but has everything else I need. Handles pretty well too. Had problems with the passenger door catch first not opening, then later not closing. Probably due to daughter  slamming the door. AC control went out but got new one at the junkyard for $60. Not bad gas mileage either, at about 25mpg. Reliability probably due to being the last year of the model run.

Still going at150k plus miles. Other than a few door dings, looks great too! Now has 182,000 and still running strong. Was going to buy a new car, but why? Trans is a little iffy infrequently at first gear downshift, but now I want to see if I can get 200k or more out of it.

chrysler,sebring,2010,S.Lewis, 11/28/2018,Waste of Money,3,"My 2010 Sebring with the V6 2.7L turned out to be nothing but JUNK ! With a little over 100 , 000 miles the water pump went out . Then not even a year later with about 117 , 00 the engine went . I would not  recommend anyone buy any Chrysler or Dodge with this engine in it . You will be disappointed!
"
chrysler,sebring,2010,CricketValarie, 01/28/2020,Run away!,1,"I'm sure there are some folks who love their Sebring. I am not one of those people. Let's start with the fact that unlike most cars on the road today, the Sebring has its battery in the most inconvenient locations. You have to remove the driver's side wheel to get at it. Why? There is plenty of space under the hood. This only added to labor costs when I brought the jalopy in for a check up because it kept dying randomly only to be revived when one steps on the brake...? 
After inspection of the charging components, it was deemed that nothing was wrong with it. Several months later, the car dies because of - yup - a dead battery. Granted, the service shop likely didn't do their job, but had the battery been in a convenient place that didn't require one to put it onto a lift or jack and climb under the vehicle (in 10 degree weather...in the snow...), I would have tried to replace the battery myself which would have saved me HUNDREDS in repair costs, towing, labor, etc.
Don't waste your money or your time. Find something with a convenient location for its integral and oft-replaced parts. If you figure the average battery lasts up to three years, that means extra labor and repair costs to get at it, just to replace something you'll spend a maximum of $100 on in an auto store. Replacing a battery takes no time at all; placing the vehicle on a lift, removing the tire/wheel, accessing the battery through the wheel well, replacing the components, replacing the tire/wheel, and lowering the car down from the lift takes too long and for this reason, I suggest you run away from any Chrysler brand vehicle.

chrysler,sebring,2010,Ash Kidman, 12/22/2009,You get what you pay for,3,"Firstly, I didn't purchase this car, it was provided as a company vehicle. After just three weeks of driving the vehicle and with 1300 miles on the odometer, I have already had to replace a tail lamp bulb (not that big a deal) and now the engine light is on. The seats on this vehicle take some getting used to, the interior looks nice but the materials are cheap. Engine in my vehicle is actually the 2.7 V6, and as V6's go it is unrefined and sluggish. Gas mileage is average for a vehicle this size. My company had a choice between this car and the new Taurus. The Taurus is bigger, more powerful, better built and more expensive...the Sebring proves the old adage, you get what you pay for."
chrysler,town-and-country,2000,Erin, 12/02/2015,2000 Town & Country Limited,4,"We bought this van used 3 years ago with about 160,000 miles on it. We had to replace the alternator within the first month, but that was the most major repair it's needed since we've owned it. Needless to say, that leaves me very satisfied with the van's overall mechanical reliability. Starts right up every try. It's not the zippiest van I've ever driven, but is a very comfortable ride.  Shortly after we got this van the back hatch quit opening, over the years the passenger doors quit opening from the inside, both annoying issues we haven't really looked into getting fixed, so I don't know how expensive it will be.  At some point the left turn signal started acting up. Randomly it will not work. Our best deduction is that there is a problem in the switch (at the steering column). The flakiness of the turn signal was my biggest safety concern with this van, however. Handles well on snow, ice, and rain. We have 5 kids ages 7-16, and found the roominess left some to be desired, it's not terrible, not great.  Sound system was great before two of the speakers got blown out. Heated seats never worked right, drivers side didn't heat at all, and when the passenger side worked it felt like it might set you on fire. There was a recall on heated seats that year. After 30,000 miles, I can say I enjoyed driving this van and would recommend it for it's reliability. It is primarily my husband's van now, as we have gotten a newer Toyota Sienna for the family. Previously we owned a 1998 Nissan Quest, I loved our Quest, it went to 219,000 miles then it was stolen. Comfort and overall sturdiness of the interior of the Chrysler were better than our Quest, tho. We considered getting a newer Town & Country when we decided to upgrade our van, but after much research found the Toyotas to have the best overall reviews. This year of Town and Country was a good one for us.

For example: It carries 4'x8' plywood sheets and up to 12' long boards inside with the tailgate closed. It tows my 16' tri-hull with 110 hp motor anywhere and pulls up wet gravel launch ramps with ease. It has taken me skiing when plows couldn't get up the mountain because of stuck cars and SUV's blocking the road, but I could weave through and make it! With 113,000 miles on the 3.8 litre V-6, it uses no oil and still get's 22 mpg all around. It carries up to 7 adults in complete comfort (4 captains chairs, 1 bench seat) with no transmission hump.

Seating is excellent (we have 4 captains chairs + the back bench). Acceleration, and driver visibility are also excellent. Good headroom, too,  About the only complaints I have are that the gauges (especially the speedometer) are very hard to read at dawn and dusk. there is also some sort of radio interference from lights at night. Road noise could be lower, but car has nearly 130k miles, so some may be due to the normal aging of car. Earlier models (like our '92 Grand Caravan) had transmission problems, but (knock on wood!) they seem to have been fixed by 2000.  Wife has 07 Lexus ES 350, but I like to drive T & C better!"

everything (tests) to identify problem,

The brakes are horrible and there always seems to be something wrong with the electrical system.  At 50k, we had to replace the belt tensioner, idler pulley and crank pulley.

transmission solenoid pack replaced 
twice; rear brake cylinder replaced; 
transaxle cover and transmission pan 
resealed; water pump and complete head 
gasket set replacement to cure coolant 
loss on 3.8 engine at 31,000 miles. All 
of the above repairs fully covered by 
3/36,000 warranty.  Replacement of 
brake master cylinder at 40,000 after 
losing brakes under extended warranty.  
Have had three used minivans and two  
new Plymouth Grand Voyager vans.     
The 1998 Plymouth Grand Voyager     
built by Chrysler that I traded in on 
this Daimler-Chrysler built Chrysler 
LTD van, was 100% trouble free over 
38,500 miles.  "

chairs like mom and dad- captains 
seats! Ultra smooth ride, super quiet 
ride. Have only had to have routine 
maintenance performed. Best sound 
system I've ever heard in a vehicle.

of storage space for hauling luggage 
to large items. Overall, best ride 
I've ever owned!"

chrysler,town-and-country,2000,AARON, 07/06/2005,"Good minivan, bad tranny",3,This has been an affordable practical vehicle to drive with the exception of having to replace the speed sensor and having the tranny rebuilt at 75k miles. Transmisson shop and dealership said they see the Chrysler/Dodge minivans all the time with bad transmissions having to be rebuilt which I have also heard from other Chrysler/Dodge minivan owners. It's a shame Chrysler has a reputation for bad transmissions around 60-70k miles. About $1700 for rebuilt transmission. Nice ride and great features but poor reliability. No wonder there are so many for sale.
chrysler,town-and-country,2000,charlesk32, 04/02/2002,Better than expected,4,"Amazed at the comfort of the captains chairs on my first all day trip. Great pickup, good cornering and road feel for a roomy minivan.  Removing both the 2nd and 3rd row seats is quite simple.  In 2+ years of use, I have removed that seat 3 times to use the full cargo capacity of the van. Otherwise, I have a vehicle which comfortably seats 7.  Fuel economy in town (hilly) avg 13-14 mpg.  On a trip, cruising at 65-70 mph, gas mileage will avg 24-26 mpg. Sliding doors both sides provide easy access to rows 2,3/cargo area."

I replaced fog lamps, headlights, and windshield to make it look new.
It now has 140,000 miles on it.
Had a $300 repair on transmission, new brakes, battery, tires, and driver's side power window switch.
It's reliable, quiet, and comfortable.
Ice cold three zone a/c works great.
I'm surprised at poor reviews.
Mine still drives like new and looks great inside and out. I guess I got lucky.
I will keep it until it turns to dust.

It had been owned by my husbands brother since it was new and has only 37,000 miles on it. For most of it's 10 years of life, it sat in a mountain town of Colorado. Nevertheless, when we got it, the back tailgate door would not open automatically and the side doors work sporadically. The main cup holder in the front is broken, and 2 days ago the AC started hissing and now has stopped working entirely. I am taking it in to the mechanic tomorrow, and hope it just needs recharging. How could the compressor be shot at only 37,000 miles? My husband and I have been hit hard by the recession, so we hope to be able to get many miles out of this van. "
chrysler,town-and-country,2001,Rick, 04/03/2009,Very important to read!!!,4,"These are the best riding vans on the road. Yes, there are issues with parts such as a/c, sway bar bushings transmissions. However, we have owned these since 1987 & we have never had to replace a timing belt (They have chains), never any exhaust work, never any CV boots. Most parts are pretty reasonable too. Brakes jobs run about $200 per axle, whereas they cost about $700 on our Previa! It is critical to do preventive maintenance on these. Use snthetic transmission fluid & change it every 50K. Change your fuel filter too. Plugs, antifreeze & water pump should be done at 80K. We did our first brakes job at 78K & we sold it with 157K & the brakes were still good. Overall, a great value!"

chrysler,town-and-country,2001,Lancaster PA, 06/30/2003,Won Over,4,"We were skeptical regarding Chrysler due to 
reliability issues.  It was easier to drive than 
an SUV.  We tested the Honda (interior 
noise issues), Toyota (too small third row), 
the Caravan and leased the T&C, with 
option to buy.
We are very happy with it.  We have not had 
any problems with it and keep to regular 
maintanance every 5000 mi.  
It handles GREAT in the snow and ice, plus 
gives us reassurance in wet conditions.
It was the only minivan with the 2nd and 3rd 
rows having LATCH system (Toyota and 
Honda only had it in 2nd row).

We will plan to buy it at the end of our lease 
(2004) as we have had no problems 
(especially the transmission & brakes)."

Have put 6k miles on it, and the list of repairs have been unbelievable. Whole new rack and pinion, check engine light keeps coming on, ABS light on, passenger window works sometimes, the electrical system is a joke, the tranny is junk, the doors work whenever. On two occasions my children could have been injured, once when the brake caliper locked up causing smoke and almost a fire, the second time the steering went out and I had to fight to keep it on the road and not into a hillside.  My advice, RUN away now. DO yourself a favor and by foreign. Don't buy this van. It's the most expensive hunk of junk I've ever owned. "

The major problem is the cost to 
maintain it.  After the first year, 
every time it went into the Dealership

You signal left and sometimes nothing happens and sometimes it blinks to the right.  Wipers hit or miss wether they will even come on.  Driver's window goes down and sometimes doesn't come up.

Was very surprised to have first 25 shop visits under 25,000 miles.  Chrysler opted to refuse replacement as they were not repeat problems, rather new ones each time. Both front power windows out - more than once, A/C repairs and finally replaced at 35K, both power sliding doors out and motors replace - more than once,  balancing bar out, weather stripping came off front windshield, transmission repaired twice (before 60,000 miles...

The driver's side window motor was replaced at 100,000 miles, and the passenger seat heater fixed when we first got it, but other than that, it has been a wonderfully comfortable, really nice looking, and totally reliable van that we have been very happy and thrilled to own. Unfortunately it was totalled at 134,000 miles, but the interior remained in tact and only minor injuries were sustained because of the seat and headrest and also due to the van's durability.

Cam position sensor went flakey in 2008 along with a fuel rail leak and a corroded fuel filler neck. Otherwise- A good Soccer Mom ride. No signs of any electricals failing, as some of the other posts reported. Local dealer was pretty good with service. Makes a big difference. A lot better product than the 1995 was.

A couple of years ago I called to see about having the sliding door motors replaced under warranty since it had less than 20,000 miles on it and Chrysler was very rude and took no responsiblity.

1. The rubber seal on the sliding doors

close the van. It slips right back on. 
We are trying to find time to take it 
back into the dealer for a quick repair.

Minivan.  The 2001 is my third one I 
liked the other one's so much.  I have 
upgraded luxury each time.  I now own 
the AWD LTD the only real luxury 
minivan available.  The extra weight 
added to the frame by auto liftgates 
and sliding doors is too much for the 
antique 3.8l powerplant.  Mileage 
decreased from the 1998 by almost 
5mpg. Chrysler promised the 300M 
powerplant to be fitted in 2003 and it 
is still nowhere to be found.  This 
was the last one for me.  The Honda 
Odessey is all thats left in a minivan."

like a car). More importantly, my wife 
and kids love it! It's fun to drive, 
powerful and looks pretty cool; 
something even a man's man shouldn't be 
ashamed to tool around in. Over 20,000 
miles and only a faulty ABS sensor on 
driver's side wheel, which of course is 
covered under warranty. Service at 
dealership (Falveys) is great and I 
know they'll take good care of me. No 
complaints...I definitely recommend."

work)2 service trips; then power 
steering noise 4 service trips and 
still noise, then side door didn´t open 
another service trip, brake light on 2 
service trips, battery dead 2 times 2 
service trips. Bad quality and 
dealership service is just worst. They 
used to give a service survey buy not 
anymore (I wonder why). And Dealership 
gave me the advice to get an extended 
warranty!!!! GET A JAPANSE VAN INSTEAD 
OF THIS JUNK."

problems with T&C at all.  Test drove 
all the other vans but hands down no 
one could match the ride comfort of 
this one.  Owned a 96 Caravan before 
and DCX has done a great job of 
improving these! No problems taking 
seats out.  Don't need the Honda trick 
just use my own muscles. Would 
recommend to everyone looking."
chrysler,town-and-country,2001,Steve G, 07/12/2003,Great car,4,"Ample power, even with the smaller 3.3, 
comfortable, very reliable.  Yes, the 
rear seat doesn't fold down, but if you 
remove it you have much more room than 
the vans I've seen where seats fold 
flat.  The seat comes out easily, but 
it is a little heavy.  The wheels help 
out immensely."
chrysler,town-and-country,2001,Bubba Jo Bubba, 07/27/2003,Not bad,4,"Not a bad van.  Bought it because it 
was the only American mini on Consumer 
reports ""reliable"" list. Very 
comfortable/lots of room.  Center and 
rear seats are removable. The seats are 
very heavy, and you have to be careful 
when removing them The seats have 
wheels, and greatly improved hardware.  
Go slow, and it's do-able.  Radio 
sounded great, but it's an odd-ball 
size which leaves you very little 
choices if you want to put in an 
aftermarket radio.  Alternator died, 
and airbag light would not go out at 
18K, 1 A/C recall.  All quickly and 
cheerfully fixed at dealer.  Battery 
died at about 25K.  All in all, a great 
car to take a LONG drive in."

the shop except for routine 
maintenance).  My only regret is that I 
didn't spend a little more and get the 
bigger engine and tires.  My only 
complaint is it's a little noisey on 
some types of concrete roads.  My only 
problem was a blown rear tire.

We have had the radio replaced, AC problems, and window electrical problems.  Recently, while driving with my 3 kids, the car just stopped in the middle of the road.  Since then, the power control module was replaced, only to have the car break down again.  Paid $300 to have it towed back to a local dealer since we were on vacation at the time.  Just hope to get it running long enough to trade it in.  Will never buy another chrysler....ever!

Transmission, sliding door, air-conditioner, struts, warped roters, seat heaters went out twice on both front seats, etc.  The list is too long.  We loved our mini-van in the beginning, but we soon realized we had an undependable vehicle on our hands.  We sold it and bought a Toyota Highlander. The lack of 7/70 on the transmission was the main reason.  We had always had it and were unaware it wasn't offered on the 2001 model - until our transmission began acting up just after 36,000 miles!  Stay away from this model!"

We were going on a family outing and I felt hesitation, thought it was my imagination, then a more predominant hesitation.  I then began pulling off to side of rode and a CLUNK.  Car wouldn't move.  $3000 later and I've got problems.  Never saw a trans go so fast in my entire life.  I just paid the car off too.  Overall we love the vehicle but i'm not sure if I'm happy with this Trans situation.  I've been hearing other Trans problems at low mileage too of these vehicles."

Maybe Chrysler has figured out how to make the basics reliable.  The bad news is that electrical problems started early and have become very expensive post-warranty.  The heated seats took 3 visits before they got working (very slowly relative to the ones in competitors cars).  Auto doors, auto thermostat, A/C, fans, instrument cluster -- all these items have had trouble.  I suspect a base Dodge Caravan may run well, but once you add the goodies you can expect frequent visits to the shop.

The dealership where I have it serviced has been ethical and helpful each and every time I have taken it in.  The window motor on the driver side went out on warranty and it was fixed right away.  I love this car.  it has very good road manners, especially in busy So. California where there is a lot of stop and go traffic.  Easy to drive.  Easy to get in and out of, too."
chrysler,town-and-country,2001,jvc, 01/22/2007,Great Family Vehicle,3,"We have been happy with our van.  I must admit to being resistant to buying a minivan because of the ""uncool"" factor.  But, the styling of the T&C is aggressive, and with the 3.8L engine, it has enough power to climb hills or tow if needed.  This van has more legroom and overall space than the competitors.  Comfort is good, and cup holders and ""cubbies"" are plentiful for the kids stuff, which helps on long road trips.  Visibility is excellent, and the handling is impressive for such a large vehicle.  I recommend getting a warranty, however.  We had the A/C compressor and condenser go out at different times, which were covered.  That paid for the warranty.  No other major problems."

Tatum, 08/05/2007,Has not been a great vehicle,3,"Overall it has not been a lemon but it has had several issues that has prompted us to consider other brands in the future. Front end was replaced at around 85000 and the trans. went at about 92000 and 115000. Service engine light stays on for no reason(checked and turned off twice)with no issues discovered. Stop,turn and taillights blow at an unbelievable rate. Rear A/C not impressive. I don't like the feel of the drivers seat in any position but my wife is comfy with it. Maybe it's a guy thing. Very poor fuel mileage.(my '99 f-150 5.4L gets at least as good)If not for the need as a people mover, I would not have it."
chrysler,town-and-country,2001,jim man, 04/24/2003,Chrysler for sale!! (NOT SAFE),2,"    This is my first Chrysler van.  
When I bought it I didn't research 
about the vehicle enough.  It is 
comfortable, reliable (If the tranny 
doesn't go out after 75K miles, or if 
the power doors will break, and many 
more, can't list there are too many), 
and NOT safe.  If you go to 
www.iihs.org you will find out that it 
got a poor, which is the lowest 
rating.  It got a poor because a lot of 
fluid in the fuel system leaked, 
another reason is that the dummy's head 
bottomed out of the air bag and hit the 
steering wheel.  Why is this a family 
van if you get in an accident your 
chance of surviving isn't good?  The 02-
and 03's got a marginal, second 
worst rating!"

I have neck and back problems, so I hit my head about 95% of the time getting in the van and I am only 5 foot 7 inches tall. Other than that the dual climate is great. The sound system could have a bit more power behind it as well now that I think of it! But it handles well and drives nice. "

chrysler,town-and-country,2001,L. Mickelson, 07/24/2019,Miracle classified ad find,5,"Purchased the 2001 on an online owner to buyer site two years ago. My budget was about 500 dollars, believe it or not. We were looking to find older 4cylinders rusted toyota truck or honda .. but here was a Chrylser mini van listed just as ""Town and Country"" . 
   The family was super honest; but reticent to look under the hood for simple problems to the car.  For pick up problems, there was a rats nest in the air filter compartment under the filter. .. a common problem the auto store said for cold weather vans with warm air filters. Next the EGR valve was so clogged with carbon you could only see black in the nickel sized space where air recirculates from the exhaust into the intake. New Exhaust Recirculation Valve cost 85 dollars.. and i could have cleaned the existing one for free. ..  We took the heads off to clean carbon out in valve compartments and cleared coolant passageways of rust with a product from Ace. The Ac compressor clutch was material which turns to dusty chalk after certain years so there is no more  sqeek from the serpentine belt with the new 100 dollar something clutch. This car is SO smooth on the highway i like to drive .. just to get my thoughts together on jobs having to do with art and when listening to tapes to complete an academic degree. When i read really negative reviews about good cars i wonder if the competition spends time on these forums. Especially the 2001 is smaller in back by about six to eight inches length, so its super cute, and one review said it looks more like and SUV.than a van. Not sure why they changed that design.  2001, 2002, 2003 really great vans. 2005, 2006 maybe better according to reviews. / 2007, and 2010 are among the years with surprises that burn and disapppoint. There are many Chrysler t and cs with low miles because the client group with drives them is by culture careful, and appreciates good designs to take care of them.. There are some issues with the rear wiper .. and the owner said something about the left sliding door not working reliably. The long distance ride really is almost like riding on a train or something. If you live in a big city and park in tight spaces, mini vians are not for you. But if you like mini vans i would really encourage these generations for test drive and review. Many have been repainted ; and the original paints really look better if you can choose  "

chrysler,town-and-country,2002,billgrissom, 03/30/2013,"Wife loves it, mechanicals are good",4,"Bought at 150K mi, currently 260K.  Top of line w/ features that are costly new, but little extra in a used vehicle.  AWD, about the last year that was offered.
Engine is dependable pushrod type.  Changed spark plugs and all cylinders measured >200 psig compression (like new).
Only major problem was a cracked flex-plate, requiring transmission removal, so I rebuilt the tranny at 190K.  Perfect inside w/ <2 mil wear on all clutch plates.
Perhaps rebuilt before we bought it (no sticker).  Engine injector wiring degraded near exhaust, causing erratic misfires.
Common high-end problems - erratic electric doors, auto-temp blower ""resistor"" failed, power steering cooler hoses leaked (dealer-installed tow package), seat heaters failed, TPMS dings fussy messages (not paying $50/wheel to change batteries every 5 years).  Power steering pump (Toyota type) has leaked several times at fitting and split body and is very hard to access.  Changed all coolant hoses to silicone and waterless coolant so hopefully no more corrosion, rear valve cover has leaked several times.  Changed timing chain at 255K, a bit worn but still in-spec, so not needed, and oil pump still in spec, but good time to replace the rubber O-rings (oil & coolant passages).

chrysler,town-and-country,2002,mattersnot, 05/28/2011,A well enginnered car,5,"I have had this van for 8 years. Everything is still original, less tires, water pump, and tune-ups.

It has 230,000 miles on it. Does NOT use oil, and still runs perfectly.

 
I am purchasing another Chrysler van next year if I can allow myself to sell this one.

I read the reviews above and concluded the vans were abused and not taken care of. I know of two other people who also have this van, and they LOVE them. 


These vans are used by N.Y.C. Taxis, and other companies as fleet vehicles because they are so dependable. Med Van, has 300 of them and use them as transport vehicles for patients.
thus, very dependable."

It is fun to drive and spacious enough to accommodate 6 adults on a 3 hour trip without any complaints. The van is usually driven around town to run errands and I enjoy driving it to work as much as my SUV. The van has 120,000 miles and you can't hear the engine run and it is quiet on the road.  The left side automatic door doesn't operate but besides that we haven't had any problems. One of the best car purchases I've ever made."

It had 175,000 miles on it but we were okay with that. It now has 204K miles and it's still going. I have never seen any other US car still drive with that many miles. We did have to replace the brakes twice and the A/C went out twice but I can't complain. We made a 13 hour drive for vacation in it with no problems. It's very comfortable and was well worth the $2,000 paid. We definitely got our money's worth. "

From time to time, noticed issues with one of the rear doors not closing with the electronic motor, but everything has gone down since then.  15 days after warranty expired, had to replace the spark plugs and wires. Constant power drain led to replacing 2 computers. rear doors do not close reliably. rear door locks do not work. Transmission issues Passenger map light has melted.

One sliding door motor replaced under standard warranty, new torque converter at 83,000 miles; otherwise normal wear and tear items only. EASY to drive, and to park considering its length.

chrysler,town-and-country,2002,Adam, 08/14/2010,This van is not your answer!,2,The brakes last 6 months at best but the rotors have to replaced because they are thin and cheaply made and warp so bad they cause the vehicle to shake violently in the front end during braking.  The suspension mainly the front is light weight flimsy steal and all the components fail because this is a very heavy vehicle with light duty junk parts.  The windows will not work due to shorting out and you guessed it cheap window motors made in some third world country.  Tires are destroyed by this vehicles poor suspension.  Try a set a year!  The rubber seals around the windows will work loose and fly off down the road. You will pay dearly for gas!  The motor is loud and rattles.

Faulted for lacking the fold-flat rear

a minimal loss of max cargo space.  The

people criticize this vehicle for it's 
lack of a fold-flat rear seat.  The 
50/50 rear seat on mine is fairly 
light, allows for greater versatility 
and, importantly, allows for the german 
AWD system down below.  Why, too, is a 
dvd option so attractive?  My children 
READ BOOKS or talk with their parents 
when we make long trips!  This is a

We purchased this van used with 61,000 miles and never had a big problem other than one issue with the power steering. But once we got over 90,000 miles it started literally coming apart at the seams. The plastic on the bottom of the driver's seat popped off. All the rear brake lights stopped working except for one. The speedometer died. Then the engine started knocking, and we knew it was time to get out fast. I loved all the features of this van, its comfort, the way it drove, etc. But the number of problems we began facing around 90,000 miles was just too many to justify keeping this vehicle."
chrysler,town-and-country,2002,MBB, 08/07/2018,Comfortable car but very unreliable after high MI.,4,"Bought used for very little money with high miles as a truck for hauling stuff around. It is very comfortable, drives well but seems to be in CONTINUOUS need of repair. As it's hard to find a mechanic where I live I have become one myself! Taking it on long trips is a nail biter. I drive around with a jack, breaker bar, etc. in the trunk. It's replacement will be SIENNA...

Update: As unreliable as before. I thought it might level out after a series of repairs but there is always a new surprise and never a boring moment!

Unbelievably quiet ride. Had this van 7 
months and not a squeak or rattle

Honda. Feel like we got more van for

We often fill it up with stuff for the lake trip to our cabin.  The leather seats and great visibility for any size driver are great.This car has lots of miles on it and we have never had a major problem with it. It is in contrast to my Suv which lost air conditioning with high mileage and age.
chrysler,town-and-country,2002,ArtO, 06/28/2002,Much better value over Honda,4,"After the first 7 months -- not one 
complaint. Almost purchased the Honda

inflated the price tag by over $3K - 
for stuff worth no more than $800. 
Basically a sham to capitalize on the 
buying frenzy going on at that time. 
I'm sooo glad I went with the T&C. The 
EX model offers great features for a

good, but the outside rear view mirrors

had the solid feel to it.  The ride is 
very smooth, better than the Honda, 
which, to me, felt kind of cramped.  
Looks great, with way to many cup 
holders! The fact that DC did not use a 
fold-down third seat was kind of a 
bummer, until I spend a few hours on

Honda was not willing to negotiate.  
Went immediately to the Chrysler 
dealership and got the last LX on the 
lot, along with the $2500 rebate, and 
have been motoring happily ever 
since.  The DVD player we got for a 
scant $400 bucks is way cool and was 
$3100 less than what Honda wanted for 
the same thing.  The warranty is 
outstanding already, 7 year/100k on 
the powertrain, and I added the 
extended bumper to bumper for next to 
nothing.  Daimler-Chrysler...started 
the minivan thing and still has it

Chrysler, the styling is better and

The interior has stood up to the wear and tear of our grandchildren without any tears.  The video system has brought a great deal of enjoyment too.  The climate control system works well.

We had an airbag issue, window motor 
stick, tranny blow and the A/C go out

tumbling seats forward. I have a bad

Just compare its' comfort, ride &

And the Lexus RX300 (""camry on big

feel I saved over $2500 and got more 
for my money.  Plus, for as much as 
these MV's cost, I want a palace.  The 
Ody is as sparten/sterile as my 1991 
civic.  Although I am taking a risk 
with reliability with a DCX product - 
the EX jsut felt right.  We look kind 
of silly because now all of the moms 
have silver DCX MV's.  The ODY is 
great as is the MPV.  Just make sure

inflated pricing and lack of 
availablility.

We got our car from an Internet company 
(carsdirect) for $6000 under sticker,

a friend of mine who bought a 2000 
Honda Odessy, she reported lots of 
problems with her automatic doors.  She 
has made many trips to the dealer for 
repairs, and I have yet to have one

chrysler,town-and-country,2002,Sperbsy, 06/25/2004,We love our van,4,"Overall, this is a solidly built 
vehicle, that rides much quieter than 
the comparable Ford, GM, or even the 
foreign mini-vans (ours is 2002).  For 
smoothness and 'quiet-ness' of the 
ride, it gets a ten in my book.  
Powerful enough for our needs, but 
could use a little more. The only 
problem in the first 30,000 miles was 
the lift hatch, which still acts up 
every once in awhile.  Otherise, this 
has been a trooper for the year and a 
half we have owned it. "

broke down after 2nd day of ownership. 
Car has had three catalytic converters 
in the first 12 months. Has had A/C 
system replaced in its entirety 3 
times. Car has been out of service for 
warranty repairs 3 months out of 26 
months of ownership. Car has had its 
entire fuel injection system replaced.
Response from Chrysler customer 
service was ""what do you want us to do 
about it?""
Interior trim is cheap, poorly fitting 
and easily damaged during normal use.
Undoubtedly the worst car mistake I 
have ever made."

Compared it to other minivans, such as 
Honda and Toyota, but did not compare 
in ""features"" or look. Have experienced

O2 sensor replaced, power train module

all under warranty! However, the 
problem still occurs. I am getting 
tired of running to the dealer. I am 
furious and frustrated w/ Chrysler

The All wheel drive gets through 1 to 6 inches of snow as well as previous SUVs owned by us. Amazing storage and interior comfort. Power sliding doors and liftgate are actually alot more useful than originally planned. Removing seats is easy, and allows alot of configuration options. Two recalls and a replaced power steering unit are the major service issues at just under 50000 miles. Solid highway cruiser, not exactly nimble, but very comfortable. Mileage is not very good, but similar to SUVs of past with alot more room and still solid all weather performance."

Headliner was loose and squeaked horribly upon delivery.  Power steering hose leaked.  Transmision cooling line ruptured (towed).  Clock gains 1.5 min per week, 6 min per month. O2 sensor replaced.  Computer control replaced (twice)  Power sliding doors failed (3 times) Power lift gate failed (twice)  Transmission slips in cold weather. Actual MPG 17.8 highway. And the bigest...

Suddenly a little over 80K miles the transmission failed.  Since then it has a spring problem, leaking manifold seal, CV boot problem, frozen ignition and tearing and failing rubber parts on it.  We were considering another T&C but the warranty has been shortened and now we are looking at the Honda & Toyota based on their reliability reports.  I do like the style of the Chrysler best of the vans, it looks better, not so fat like the Honda and Toyota.  Also, why can't Toyota and Honda have a standard compass like the Chrysler has.  The trim package is better at a lower level on Chrysler than Toyota or Honda. "

concern--my van had six passengers at 
the time of accident and thank the 
Lord, no one was injured (the van was

The van is beautiful and comes with just about every creature comfort I could imagine. However, we have also encountered every mechanical problem you can imagine. Brakes wear out very fast, gas mileage is terrible. We average 11 mpg in the city and 15 mpg on the highway. We've lost the air-bag clockpring twice, the check engine light comes on all the time, air-conditioner had to be replaced twice, too many issues to list. I would never purchase another one. Definitely not the car for these economic times, either. But it is pretty and you can fit just about the whole soccer team in there."

Has all the bells and whistles, DVD system, power everything, leather 3.8L engine etc.
It has been a great vehicle for us.
We are just coming up on 200,000 miles and have had very few problems.

We have done the brakes once.
Just replaced the water pump ( for a whole $120!), other than that just put fuel in it and drive.

Fit and finish is still good.
Only hardware problem is the left side power sliding door.
The clutch is out in it and so it is hard to open manually.
It will open under power if you give it a tug.
Leather seats are still perfect and still comfortable.
We have gotten about 19 MPG."

For all the horrible reviews on this model over the years, this van served me well for 11 years.
I think I had it serviced ONE time for anything other than normal maintenance and oil changes.
The leather interior is still in excellent shape, the exterior wore well also.
That said, I would NOT buy this van used.
When I turned mine in the back hatch would fall at inopportune times onto my head, the power windows were failing, and the transmission was both sounding and acting wonky.
Gas mileage was horrible."

I still drive it frequently and my now teenage daughters won't let me sell it.  I had an 80+ year old gentleman stop me at Publix and told me to never sell it as he had one, sold it, and regretted it.  I agreed.  Only costs me $150 every 6months to insure and despite less than exemplary milage still is worth keeping.  Don't know if I'll let it go before it gives up on me altogether.  Did have to replace the transmission twice and now instrument cluster needs repair.  No other major issues.  Glad I bought it.

That same night after it was fixed the speedometer quit working. Now the van jerks while I'm driving it and the speedometer flies all the way to 120mph. Mechanic replaced speed sensor, that didn't fix it I've had it to him 3 times he finally told me he doesn't know what's wrong with it and he does not want to work on it anymore. I'm praying it's not the transmission (mechanic does not think it is). It has 118,500 miles on it. I hate this van. The drivers seat sits to high, the power window is getting ready to go I would not wish this van on my worse enemy. "
chrysler,town-and-country,2003,a, 09/28/2010,Not that bad,3,"We bought this van in June of 2004. It had some miles on it but I dont remember how many. It now has almost 170,000 miles on it. Something leaked and ruined the carpet on the front passenger side. The electronic switch in the windows went bad making it stick occasionally  it would decide when it wanted to start working again. It has only left me stranded once, and that was because the battery died without warning and wouldnt hold a charge. We replaced the battery and it kept on ticking. This van is quite reliable and I never worry about getting stranded. The driver seat and the front passenger seat is not comfortable either. "

Been a play area, diaper changing area, nursing and bottle feeding. Have to remember the weird stuff. It's hauled chickens, goats, hay, fence posts, lumber. Pulled a 16ft. trailer with 50 hay bales with no problem. My husband and I are both disabled. I can honestly say that without this van, we would not have been able to do half the things we've gotten done with it. I love the tires. They stick to the road no matter the weather. I can honestly say I only have one Big Gripe. The sliding doors. I blame the dealership. We had problems with the doors from the beginning. Told the door to shut (didn't matter which button was used.) The door would start to shut. About 1 foot from closing it would bounce back open. To get it to shut we had to get out and shut it manually. Then it wouldn't open. So had to manually open it. Every time we took it in, the Dealership said they couldn't duplicate it. They finally fixed one door after I videoed it. Of course the other door went out of warranty before I could get them to fix it. I do love the safety sensors on the doors. I will Never get a van without them. Not because of our child, but because my husband and I need them.

Mine and most I run into have the hood paint peeling bad.

tranmission is being rebuilt.  All

to buy a new car and have these major

chrysler,town-and-country,2003,WhoKnowsJack, 02/08/2009,REALLY delighted,4,"This is my second T&C.  The first went 8 years without a repair.  This one was fine until this year when I've had a flurry of repairs -- clean air system, trans module, power steering pump and alternator.  Still, at 76,000 miles, it's been cheap to own.  It's not a city car; in downtown Chicago, I got 11.5 mpg.  Here in Tucson, with more open roads, I get 24 mpg when the A/C is off.  That's great for a big vehicle with the 3.8 liter engine.  But even better is the ride.  In mountains, I just gear down to '3' and go up and down smoothly and quietly, even at 80 mph (I had this up to 120 mph on a flat road in Texas). Prefer driving this to my BMW convert (except for top down days, of course). "
chrysler,town-and-country,2003,sambrijmom, 03/30/2009,Disappointed,3,I was really excited about this vehicle when I first bought.  But after 5 years and the money I've sank into I'll never buy another one again.  The steering whines when it's cold and the only way to fix it is to spend $400.  The gas tank is going to need replaced because the valve that's broken is inside the tank.  My mechanic said that for the past 2 weeks he's had a Dodge or Chrysler minivan in with problems.  I still like my minivan but it seems like every month I'm in the body shop for something else.

Within weeks we had it in the dealer for repairs, and then continued to take it in monthly for one thing or another.  We are experiencing a shock and sway bar problem, along with a fuel pump issue that makes very noticeable noise.  We have taken the vehicle in for the shocks and sway bar to be told that there is nothing wrong.  The fuel pump issue will cost us close to $800.00 - $1000.00.

So far one set of tires and brakes are all we have had to spend money on so far. There have been a couple of recall/service bulletin repairs, but other than that no real inconveniences. We get 17-19 mpg in normal driving and 22-25 on the highway. Stopping at drive throughs cuts down on the mileage! The only complaint I have is the engine doesn't run as smooth as I think it should, dealer says everthing is OK. I didn't want a MV when we went shopping for a vehicle, but after driving it and checking out its features I was sold. It is a perfect family vehicle and I plan on replacing it with a 2006 Town & Country with stow n go seats."

It has given us excellent service. It now has 274,000 miles on it and still going strong. I have done the maintenance on it my self, after getting ripped of by a dealer. (that's another story). I have changed the oil and filter every 3,000 miles, in spite of being told I didn't need to that often.(I keep a record on the maintenance) But now my care of it is paying off. Of course over the miles and years I've had to replace some things on it, but not more than any other vehicle I've owned. I like it so well, that I bought a 2007 hoping that it does just as well. It is not nearly as easy to drive, and doesn't ride as comfortable as my '03. I didn't trade it in, as they wouldn't give me more trade-in than I can drive out of it, and then give it to someone. It is now my work car. I removed all the seats but the front, and haul what I need to, plus keep my tools in it. If I hadn't been happy with it, I wouldn't have bought another one.

We did not do any repairs beyond warranty and general maintenance until over 100,000 miles. We recently drove the new Chrysler town and Country and the new one does not compare to the great quality of the old 2003. The 2003 is quieter, sits up higher, more solid, rides at least 2 times as good (2003 had Monroe sensitracks on all 4's at 100K). We ended up getting a used 2007 Jeep Cherokee V6, ( very good SUV) that was much better than new Van.

I am 55k miles in - I am on my THIRD transmission.  My compressor is shot.  I have replaced my front brake pads 6 times, rotors 3 times and calipers once (when they began to smolder). The power sliding door failed twice.  The rear door has disconnected 3 times. I have had the car rendered useless and needed to be towed to the dealer - but boy are those heated seats and cupholders nice.  I have learned my lesson.  Unfortunately it cost me quite a bit of money.  No more American cars here."
chrysler,town-and-country,2003,xy, 12/15/2005,MD,2,"I bought a 2003 brand new Town & Country mini van on June 03. Now it has 37,000 miles. The window has drop inside the door once, both front brakes were broken on highway this summer, two front tires have to replace today, the power steering cooler and hose were broken today too. What kind of car do you guys make? Could you learn something from the Japanese? "
chrysler,town-and-country,2003,KIM, 09/14/2008,great for the money,4,"I really love my T&C. It drives just like a car, it handles very well. It is very comfortable on long rides, it quit and smooth. The inside is very roomy, and looks good. There are four 12-point power points, which is nice. I absolutely love the center console, tt is big, with many compartments and can even be moved in between the two captain seats in the back. Some cons are, that the column shifter is too big, it blocks some radio controls, and sticks out like a sore thumb. The automatic sliding door is very nice when your hands are full, but when you open/close manually it is very hard to do. I also notice that the outside panels are very thin, they dent VERY easily."

chrysler,town-and-country,2003,smartinginMN, 06/21/2008,Somewhat disappointed,3,"As a pre S & G van it would have been nice for the middle row seats to fit the rear positions as they recline and taller people could have good leg room. The console design is not too well thought out.  Too rounded and could have had its' own cup holders.  At just under 95,000 miles we had to replace the a/c compressor, alternator and belt slack adjuster.  The front strut bearings are very clunky.  Fuel economy so-so.  We drove the heck out of a Mercedes Vito van in Europe (up to 100 mph/160 kph on the autobahn, in and out of small and large towns) and the 6 cylinder diesel engine gave us 27 mpg with 7 passengers and luggage. I believe that engine is now in one jeep model and a MC sedan."
chrysler,town-and-country,2003,Michael, 10/24/2008,6th mini-van .. and will buy again,4,"This is my 6th Chrysler mini-van. We have had one since the day Chrysler introduced min-vans. Really. This one is the same as the rest. Reliable, great on mileage for what it does (got 26 on the highway last week at 65 MPH with a van load of stuff), comfortable. Wish this one had the towing package and self-leveling my 2001 had. Kids are gone now and this is still my choice for most flexible 'car'. full leather seats during the week and a full load of sheet rock or lumber on the weekend. And she never complains. I'd get a newer model but there's nothing wrong with this one so why trade side-ways?"
chrysler,town-and-country,2003,Bad Van, 01/01/2009,Bad Van,2,"This van has been horrible. We bought it slightly used with only 15K miles. Got a great deal because it had depreciated so much from new (wonder why). At 28K miles the starter went out and was replaced by warranty. At 36,800 miles the power steering pump went out and they refused to fix it because the warranty had just expired even though Chrysler issued a service bulletin about it. Since then the AC compressor went out to the tune of nearly $1K. Water pump went out, electric gremlins with the engine management, and now the transmission is slipping. It has just shy of 70K miles on the clock. Gets average of 19mpg and is slow as molasses. Can't wait to get rid of it! "

I had to replace suspension bushings and the power steering pump and reservoir. We got about 19 mpg around town and 23.5 to 25 mpg on the road, depending on the wind."

Numerous problems from small, (sliding door lock broke), to large problems, (today I am having my rack and pinion replaced), have had me in the shop at least 4 times a year. Also, the dealership LIED to me about the warranty covering a rental car. It only covers a rental car if the car has to stay over night. As a single mom this makes it more difficult for me to get to work and chauffeur kids around when my car is in the shop!  Chrysler- please work on the quality of your automobiles!"
chrysler,town-and-country,2003,wizard, 09/29/2009,love this van :),5,This is my 3rd MoPar mini-van & I would own none other. Yes a few issues over the years but mostly easy-fix things. This 03 did have a transmission issue that was frustrating but the out of state dealer was the headache Not Chrysler or my local dealer. I would/will always own one of these. No chop-chop foreign s-t in my driveway. USA or nothing
chrysler,town-and-country,2003,Penguinfan, 05/27/2010,Not So Great Quality,3,"To start off, my van only gets 11 mpg. It has had the transmission rebuilt twice, has had 6 sets of rear Infinity speakers & 2 radios because of a buzzing noise. Has been in the shop a lot, but it goes great in the snow and is very comfortable. Probably would buy again but would have wished it was more reliable."

a ""home-made"" vehicle sits in my

Mazdas have all done well for us, but 
this Town & Country intrigued me, and 
so I bought it.  Obviously too early 
to tell (one week), but the buying 
experiece as well as the fit of the 
van was/is excellent.  It is a 
brilliant cruising vessel, as the 1500 
miles we (two adults, three BIG teens)
traveled in that first week showed.  
At the end of our ten hour drive, I 
turned to the missus and said, ""I 
could go another ten hours driving 
this.""  It is SOOO comfortable.  
Everything works, runs and rides 
great...easily worth the 31K.  Tune in

American when we looked at minivans.  
Honestly, I have been pleasantly 
surprised.  This vehicle has run well 
and been very solid.  Comparing the 
2002 and 2003, I can clearly see some 
cost cutting has taken place.  For 
example, I bought the Limited...it came 
with a doughnut.     
Overall, I am pleased with the

one minor problem and that was with the

Dealer has replaced BCM to correct some 
programable functions that .  Have 
trailer tow package and ride is a lot

the 3.3 liter and the feel of the
transaxle. Very solid performer so far. "

the dealer knocked of $6,200!  For a 
base model it has everything we need.  
The ride and transmition is very 
smooth.  No wind noise and no squeeks 
so far at 3,000 miles.  The quad seats 
are great for the tweenagers.  The 
headlights are much improved over the

negatives.  Two problems: rear seat is 
now a split bench and much narrower 
than our 2000 caravan.  We used to be 
able to sit three people in the back, 
now there is only room for two.  
Second, the rims are touted as chrome 
rims, but they are really just aluminum 
rims with chrome caps.  I would have 
much rather had a set of nice aluminum 
rims instead of cheap looking chrome

any major breakdowns or more than

a Toyota.  The T&C drives better and 
the a/c is much, much better.  Very 
smooth ride and quiet in contrast to my 
previous minivan, a Windstar.  
Hopefully reliability has improved and 
the 7/70 powertrain warranty gives some 
peace of mind."

really wanted to love this van, but -- 
people rave about how quiet the T&C is, 
but ours has a serious wind leak (door 
alignment problem, we're told) right by 
the driver's head so it's not quiet. 
The windshield washer hose broke after 
one week. And we get 13 mpg around

engine (3.3L) at 14000 mi.!!! It started
making a knocking noise one day, the
next it would not turn over. It spun a
bearing on the number two cylinder. Now
the ABS has stopped working and the part
is still not in after three weeks. This
morning, it barely turned over (sounded
like it wasn't getting fuel),spitting
and sputtering for about 15 seconds. Yes
it was cold (about 5 degrees) but I had
the engine block heater plugged in, my
bro never had problems with his Toyotas.
 I bought this because the ride was the
best (and still is for what it's worth)
and because of the deep discount. "

My old Buick Roadmaster wagon got 10 mpg in city. The T/C barely gets 12 mpg. Not good when gas is nearly $3 a gallon! Most of my driving is in city. Highway mileage not bad though...about 24 or so, 26 if you're easy on the gas. Overall, not a bad vehicle if you're willing to put up with less than stellar fuel economy."

At 17k mi, it needed new front brakes as the rt pads wore into the rotors (not a warranty repair of course).  Our prev cars were all manuals, and though this A/T was better than Ford's, it isn't the fastest @ downshifting, even in 3 spd mode.  The Honda A/T is fast!

 Easy to work on if you are that type and very easy to drive even in tight parking lots. The climate control system is a no brainer in its operation as are all the electronic upgrades that separate this van from most.

Chrysler and dealer didn't want to deal with it, kept saying it was normal. Breaks were horrible. Had to replace every 5000 miles and were very expensive. Had to push hard on break pedal to make the vehicle slow down. My sister has the same model and she has the same problem with the breaks. Many of my passengers would hit their head when sitting into the front passenger seat. There was no way to lower the seat and prevent that from happening. Car stalled going uphill through the mountain for no apparent reason. Cruise control would accelerate without reason. Very unreliable for a new vehicle."

Problem number three the fuel pump leaks fuel still have not fixed that because no time the vehicle is always on the road.

a good choice. I am much interested in 
the new 2005 Chrysler 300C. Chryler has 
came a long ways in the past Fifty

better but interior wood and leather is

Chrysler vans we choose the T&C. The 
Mazda was nice but a bit small and I 
found the seat to be very 
uncomfortable. During the test ride my 
butt fell asleep so that was the deal 
killer. 

The Honda was also nice but the ride 
was very busy. Also, for a $30k van it 
felt like an overgrown Civic. 

The T&C had the best ride, good 
ergonomics, best styling (yes, I know 
it's a minivan!) and was much quieter 
than the rest. The price was good but 
not incredible vs. the others. And, I 
guess buying American still means 
something to me.

Reliability has been great so far and 
hoping it holds up going forward."

99 Dodge did.   The wheel base is 
longer than the Sienna and much better 
for the handicapped scooter I must

you can all take one car!!! We love it

we were in a blazer before that!!! This

First, it drives nice, but at 5,000 miles the steering column went out (is again w/ 55,000).  At 7,000 miles, trax control/ABS sensors went out.  At 12,000 sway bar link went out and at 40,000 miles, rear windshield wiper quit.  Also at 40,000 miles had to replace spark plugs because factory installed wrong ones to begin with. Had to replace on my dime and also had to have the computer reset because of this mistake. Chrysler installing wrong stuff at factory cost me $500. Also, electric windows work intermittently."
chrysler,town-and-country,2004,Curt, 07/27/2007,Favorable,5,One main fault is visibility of brightlight indicator is very poor. Seats are easy to get out but sort of heavy to lift out of thr vehicle.  Was disappointed that to get a 4 X 8 sheet of plywood in the van and to close the truck required the seat to be up against the steering wheel and therefore impossible to drive.

I purchased another one because I so enjoyed the use I received from the 2001 model.
I like the new and improved features on the 05, especially the stow and go seats (no more lugging 35 lbs plus seats out of the van).
This is the best part of the 05 for me.. I can drop the seats, load up and still know that after my haul, I do not have to return home to get the seats or worse, on a long trip, do without the seats.
Mechanically, I do wish the transmission would react a little quicker (the 01 had the same issue). Lots of competition out there, but the Chrysler wins for me"
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,frankee09, 10/07/2009,outstanding value,4,"Bought our Town & Country touring edition new because of the price and stow &Go.   Best decision I made that year. Have travled the entire USA and packed some heavy loads.  Never returned to the dealer as the vehicle has never had a problem in 50,000 miles. Still has  original tires and brakes. Only cost is gas and oil changes at 7500 mile intervals.  Have never reset the MPG computor and it showes 20.4 MPG for an average of the 50,000 Mi. I intend to replace the front brake pads soon and tires before winter.  Hope all my future cars are as pleasing as this vehicle."

This was the first new vehicle purchased.We paid off our financing 1 year ago, the body has rusted trough on both doors and is popping up other spots, the left side door wont open and neither does the back hatch. It starting losing power gradually, we took it back to the dealer and after 4 days they said we have to replace the commputer.1000.00.

chrysler,town-and-country,2005,Tammy, 04/06/2010,Excellent quality,4,"I bought this car with only 11,000 miles on it, from a rental pool.  I have not had any major repairs, and it is now at 78,000 miles.  It has traveled from Washington State to Rapid City, SD, multiple times, getting from 18-24 mpg.  It hauls kids, dogs, and yard waste, just as well as a truck does.  The stow and go seats are heaven.  I can set up for grandkids in five minutes, take it down to haul recycle materials in the next five minutes.  If people are complaining about this van, it must be due to poor care and maintenance.  I have taken my van in and literally used the book for all its servicing, and as I said, no major issues at all."
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,brickfix, 11/28/2006,Good Van,4,"First van we have owned. Was skeptical from reviews from owners of earlier year models but it has been reliable. It is very nice to drive, handles corners well, is smooth going down the road and has all the room you need. The stow-n-go is great, can't believe it wasn't thought of sooner. The 3.3 is somewhat under powering, 3.8 should be standard on all models. Fuel mileage is around 22 average. Best van for the price."

Front end was replaced and power steering pump reservoir  (This by the way will fix the power steering pump whine.) AC never worked bad condesor, never fixed just lived without.  Other than that the van has been very reliable nothing but oil changes and transmission services. Put 400 miles a night on this van. Loved the sirus radio for the long trips. Did seem to go through some brakes. Would by another in a second resale value makes a low mileage one of these a real value don't know much about the 2008 plus design.

chrysler,town-and-country,2005,stu, 06/04/2006,bad brakes,4,"Have had it 11 months.  Had to switch dealership for bad service.  Rattles, and bad brakes.  Put discs in rear or make front disc larger.  Very poor gas mileage.  15 city and 21 hwy.  Traded in Ford expedition for better mileage and didn't get much better."
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,Richard, 03/02/2017,Best for the Money,4,"One of the most comfortable, reliable cars I've owned. The engine is strong; the transmission too. But check underneath for suspension wear (tie-rods, etc.); have the alternator checked before you buy, and listen for power-steering pump sounds. Like most US cars, the headlamp covers get crazed; they can be polished down once. Unlike a lot of cars, the paint will last without peeling--avoid metallic colors especially silver. Electric windows are twitchy and you can't replace individual components--all or nothing. You can't attach a hitch; live with it. Take out the rear seat for a useful cargo carrier. Go over the car for mis-aligned panels which mean accidents. Change the oil religiously and this car will serve you. In 10 years I've replaced one radiator core, an alternator, a headliner, window motor, and a radio. The instrument panel is ok; it could use a tach, and check the fuel guage so you don't have to use the odometer. Fuel economy depends on care and highway speed. I get 30 mpg at 65 mph, even more downhill.

This can also be seen locally here in Michigan on numerous other Chrysler T&C and Dodge Caravan/Grand Caravan vehicles made around 2005.

It is always in the shop for something scheduled to go there on 8/14 for the paint chipping off and sliding doors again 3rd time. We plan to unload this piece of junk as well."

I think it is one of the nicest looking minivans around. The front captain chairs, wood and silver trim, stow and go system, and power doors are really nice features. But the power doors and tailgate do not work all the time. Navigation system failed, button lights have gone out, rear seats are uncomfortable, and some materials feel very cheap. Also, the chrome on the outside of the vehicle has started to peel off. The worst thing, I think is the accelerator. When it is pressed down, it will not accelerate the
car until several seconds after. Good-looking but very annoying."

The makers of the Town & Country have areas on side panels that were not treated properly.  You can look at any T&C on the road that was made around 2005 and they ALL have rust in the SAME places.  Very Poor design.

But every single time it rains I cannot drive it my steering will lock up, power down almost completely, and it leaves me and very dangerous situations. I want to know why Chrysler has not done a recall on this problem because I see many people having the same problem and it is a manufacture flaw .it should have been recalled long ago. I think I'm about to lawyer up and everyone of you out there having this problem should do the same. How many people agree with me?

this van at 47K, put 20K on it. (had a '98 T&C LXI w/AWD.) The '05 is nice, but AWD was better than traction control. Van has held up fairly well, but a LOT of small items set off the CHECK ENGINE light. All pwr equipment still works. We HAVE had issues: EGR valve, ABS sensors, the famous power steering whine (replaced belt, PS pump, still occurs.) Also replaced tensioner & noisy idler pulley to resolve belt slip in wet conditions, plus the inevitable brake pads/rotors. The 3.8L is powerful, but front wheels can spin easily in the rain. 6-disc DVD system is handy, but sound quality is poor compared to the Infinity system in the LXI. Gets good MPG for a van. Overall a decent car."

I now know why the Honda & Toyota minivans are more expensive.  In 3 years, I've replaced a rack & Pinion, 3 water pumps, an airbag switch, and a power window switch.  Unfortunately, the reliability just is not there.  I've owned 2 Honda's and 1 Suzuki and I've never had these kind of problems.  First & last time I buy American.  I'm trading this junk in for a Honda Odyssey first chance I get.  Only positive, the highway gas mileage is excellent.  I went from central PA to the North Carolina Outerbanks on 2 tanks of gas.  "

In spite of that, the only repairs have been one rear ABS sensor fixed under partial warranty and an EGR valve that tripped the check-engine light at 70k.  The ride is pretty hard, but not much more so than my 2008 Sienna.  Road noise, acceleration and braking were similar as well, though the Chrysler has slightly better steering.  It's much nicer in every respect than the 2008-2015 model Chryslers I've rented, but hoping the new Pacifica is better.  By the way, it's just now on its second set of brakes in all those short trips, so I'm not sure what to say about reports of poor brake pad life--could be driving habits or could be theirs had a defect of some sort.  Anyway, never heard much good about Chrysler reliability but this one has been great.

Finally took it to dealer at 22673 miles for replacement of rack and pinion and power pump assembley unit. Started acting again and took to a different dealer
with 25,228 miles, to put another rack and pinion and power steering pump with hose too.
 At 26,692 miles took it back to last dealer for same problem and was repaired under warranty. Noise finally stopped, and,started again. Hose burst at 30600 miles in 2010, and replaced at Pep Boys in El paso,Tx
 Hose tears at 21 months later,I remove it to find out that Pep Boys used a Smog hose instead of power steering."

Replaced the rack and pinion at 30K, the transmission at 37K, repaired locks/sliding mechanism on doors at 15K, 37K, 57K, and 62K, replaced water pump at 62K replaced EGR at 59K, Coil at 62K and coil AGAIN at 65K.  Last 3 were once every three months as a result of failure while driving my family around.  On the plus side it saved me an extra trip for the oil change...small consolation.  All dealer work, NEVER offered a loner.  I keep telling myself THIS big repair must be the last one and the van will be fine now...NOT!  Time for a different brand."

I also love driving this van and hope to buy a new one if I can save the money.  Would recommend it to anyone.  Also the automatic sliding side doors and lift gate are a life saver especially when carrying something and your hands are full (like a dog)."

So we finally dropped a few dimes on a newer vehicle. I have had to perform some standard maintenance and thanks to Youtube I was able to take care of most issues on my own. I purchased this vehicle know Chrysler had made some necessary changes in design to the vehicle, the transmission in particular. I have run primarily synthetic motor oils and Lucas Oil Products Fuel Treatment. The suspension has been put to the test vigorously and when you drop all of the seats, the cargo space is cavernous.  My wife really loved the stow and go feature. We will miss the storage space. I really can't say enough about this vehicle!

Now at 21,000 new brake pads needed.  The paint is chipping and I have rust spots.  Dealership is no help.  Blame EVERYTHING on my driving. Yeah right. Never had these problems with my Chevy cars.

The problem with most people is that they don't do any maintenance on their own vehicles anymore. My van performs excellently. I get 27.5 mpg on the highway. For such a heavy vehicle, that's not so bad. Many people complain about the brakes wearing out prematurely. If you take it to a dealership, you have a right to complain. Here's the solution, by a book. Thirty to forty-five minutes later you have a complete brake job for under fifty bucks. The problem with your power steering unit in the morning has something to do with temperature. Buy a book. Popping in the front end, a small four dollar bushing!"

Replacement part not issue - this TC had early version of body control computer module (late 2004). Chrysler has issued a service bulletin about this to dealers. Apparently a error in computer programing that results in false random error codes. When error code happens, related system is shut down by computer. Last trip in to dealer 2 days ago, they re- programmed the computer using corrected software. Still no cost even though car was out of warranty miles.

Wife/kids wanted stow and go seats & DVD player. This car is in the shop a lot.  Repeated problems with steering moaning noise, interior parts falling off, sliding door roller and sliding door electrical failures. The car is currently on it's third set of brake pads. The stow and go feature works well for the 3rd row.  The 2nd row uses smallish seats and is more cumbersome to change out.  Handling is ""boaty"" but adequate. Gas mileage averages 18-19 mpg."

We got it for $6200. Everything works fine on it. I did make a couple of changes to it. I installed new headlight housings because the originals were yellowed and made the van look old. Now it looks like new. I also installed a new modern sound system, since it had a base stereo in it. Now we have a way to play music directly from my Ipod. We've had Chrysler/Dodge mini-vans for over 20 years with exceptional luck. They are solid, dependable and very versatile. Additionally, they are the easiest vehicle to get in and out of. I would 100% recommend a Chrysler/Dodge mini-van.

chrysler,town-and-country,2005,blackhawkqt, 10/12/2010,Never Again,4,"We bought this van new in 2005. We have had nothing but problems with it. It was in the shop 52 times just in the first 2 years. The dealer would not take it back and Chrysler customer service actually hung up on me when I called to find out what they would do about it! It did not fall under the lemon law because the same thing did not brake 4+ times or the vehicle was not completely disabled for 30+ days.  The electric system dies without warning, electric doors work sometimes (only one key entry on driver door), a/c has to be fixed every summer, drivetrain nothing but issues since warranty was up, goes through brakes every year because of faulty design.  Do NOT buy this vehicle!"

It's February and my wife and 2 kids are with me. Called dealer who could not help me because no message appeared on dash. Told to drive till it breaks down and then call with message that appears on dash! I limped home on the side of I-90 for extra 3 hours. Left it at dealer. They kept for 2 days and could not get it to act up. This happened twice and they still could not tell me what is wrong. Buying new in this case was a huge loss! Total danger to be on the road.

It was a very affordable solution to our growing family's need for a bigger vehicle.  The base model is not base at all.  It has power windows and locks, CD/DVD player, cruise, and more.  We love the styling, it is very classy looking and drives very well.  I have no comment on reliability yet but it seems extremely well-built.  I'm sure Chrysler reliability has greatly improved since the merger with Mercedes.  I anticipate no problems."

This creates flexible seating arrangements allowing maximum storage and passenger capacity.  The 3 zone climate control quickly balances temperature even on the hottest days.  The overhead storage is convenient both front and back and the sound system with in dash 6 disc player is very impressive with steering wheel controls couldn't be more ergonomically perfect.  The ""back- up sensor"" system is a very nice additional feature as are the power side doors and rear liftgate.  The added convenience of 3 overhead remote control buttons gives this vehicle great flexibility.  The town & country couldn't be a more perfect automobile"

respectable fuel economy. My old 1996 
Dodge Grand Caravan never spent one 
minute in the garage for service, except for  
normal oil changes and cooling system 
service. I wasn't sure whether the powered 
side doors were really necessary on the 
2005, but they have been a big help to older 
second-row seat passengers. We looked at 
the Honda Odyssey and Toyota Sienna, but 
it seems that all of their salespeople have an

chrysler,town-and-country,2005,Andy, 08/08/2005,Excellent overall van.,4,"We brought the T&C as our first van.  I was impressed with how well the van drives compared to most cars I have owned.  Unlike some vans, you can still drive it like a drivers car.  It corners well, has excellent power and wonderful full throttle acceleration.  The seats are very comfortable, if a bit on the hard side.  I would recommend getting the heated seats.  The sunroof is a very nice touch and you might not even feel like you are driving a van.  The 6 disk CD changer is good for long trips.  I would not get the DVD if you have a laptop, you can buy a $30 inverter at target that lets you use it in the car and saves you a grand.  The only minus is bad mileage.  It needs a fourth gear."

We bought our 2005 Chrysler Town & Country because we got a price we couldn't turn down, and are we glad we did so!  It's everything we liked abour our Caravan, and much more.  It has enough power, the mileage is more than acceptable, the fit and finish is outstanding, the equipment on the base model includes everything that's important to us, and it's one of the most comfortable cars we've ever had or driven.  We're very pleased with it."

I really like the vehicle, but was discouraged with the mileage, averaging 16-17 mpg before the motor was broke in. I do both highway and city driving and now am averaging more like 20-22 MPG. Considering it advertises at 18-26 MPG this is much improved especially with gas prices. My 1992 car got 23 MPG so I am extremely happy the van is now getting close to this."

Gave it a tune up and tranny flush runs worse than ever!  Now the instrument cluster panel is messing up was told it will possibly be 700 dollars to reprogram it. I have owned this for 14 months and have put 1400 dollars in it without the instrument panel. They also are telling me I have a possible wiring problem and the belt is acting up now! I realize you have to put money into cars but I feel 1400 dollars is really steep when you only owned it 14 months and paid $12,000 for it. Keyless entry died."
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,jim, 07/01/2008,Many problems,4,"The dealership where I purchased it was great. I had to drive back there for all warranty work. It was 300 miles away but the dealers around where I live always said nothing was wrong or it wasn't covered under warranty. Kudos to Gurley-Leep. They replaced the handle on the rear hatch, alternator, battery, electric sliding door. At 44,000 miles I had to replace brake pads. After 40,000 miles I lost 2- 3 miles per gallon and it started running rough. Manual recommends 75,000 miles for first tune up but needed one about 40,000 miles. Transmission slips when slowing down and taking off without coming to complete stop."

Mine has 56k and here's what's been replaced: 1.  tie rod ends (twice) 2.  steering rack and pinion 3.  sway bar bushings 4.  EGR valve 5.  Air conditioning lines (twice under recall) 6.  Brakes have to be done every 12k. 7.  door sensor.  In addition, the tranny is slow to shift when it's put into reverse.  I can only hope it goes out completely before the 70k powertrain warranty is up.  If you buy one of these, make sure you budget for repairs!"

A month later it started sparking when opened not small sparks but nice 2-3 inch blue sparks jumping from door to frame, i pulled the fuse on the automatic doors so my children would not get shocked, pulled the door panel and checked all the wires for a break but could not find any. It's out of warranty and really do not intend to pay the cost of taking it to the dealer, just curious if anyone else has had such issues?

It took six visits to cure it by replacing the entire fixture. Later, light after light went out on the dash. Once the entire vehicle completely shut off, lights, radio, engine completely off. Every time I get gas, on leaving the station I get a 1/4 of a mile away, and the oil light comes on, the engine shudders and the thing completely stalls out. When I take it to the dealership I am told they ""can't find anything"", given am a mystified look as though I am an annoying hysterical woman and charged $108. Absolute junk! No problem. Its Japanese replacement is already in the driveway. "
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,Elaine N, 12/19/2008,Huge Disappointment,2,"Within the first year, the van started having major problems.  It died on us four times in the first year, each for different reasons. The quality of the interior is terrible, and we always held our breath when we had to rely on it for a long or special trip. This despite the high price of the model. I have hated the car since I drove it away and would never recommend it to anyone."
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,Paul, 12/30/2008,Extended Warranty is Needed,3,"I bought the van new and for the first 30K miles it ran trouble-free. The first issue was resurfacing brake rotors at 32K. Next issue was replacement of belts, water pump and stabilizing bar and bushings at 48K. The latest issue was the replacement of the power steering rack at 51K. I want to be brand loyal, but it's getting harder with each issue. The brightside is when I factor the savings from the 0% interest loan and generous rebate at the time of purchase vs the costs, I'm still ahead in total price when compared to Honda and Toyota. I just hope that the van runs trouble free for the remainder of my loan."

Ride is quiet, smooth, very predictable. Plenty of power to pass and climb hills. Nav system is OK but not great, tends to run out of map."

It's the van I no longer trust.  Today was the second time I was stranded because the darned thing didn't want to start. I've had a module that controls all electrical functions replaced, and am now awaiting the electrical line for the power cargo door on the driver's side. After shopping and having to get home, I tried starting my van and it was DEAD!  I called for a tow truck and in the meantime, tried to start my vehicle after 10 minutes.

We've replaced the brakes 4 times, have had issues with the windows and locks, power steering, transmission, and radio. The wheels are constantly covered in black brake dust that is horrible to remove. Service says this is normal for this van. Van lets in a terrible amount of road noise and the construction seems so much cheaper than our previous van. I cannot express what a mistake it was to buy this van. Looking to dump it now, but it's worthless."

Although still looks good from outside and in, it has developed serious electrical problems.  Parts of dash stop working, 5 minutes later they work.  A dash light out, smack the dash it come on.  Had one time where vehicle lost complete power (fuel injection, steering, etc...) Got it off the road, turned key off and back on and it worked.  When problems starting ocurring, dealers were no help.  Said they could pull the dash and start tracing wires.  Needless to say it is leaving our house soon.  Also, serious braking problems and expense.  Also, very uncomfortable drivers seat."

This vehicle has never failed me except for needing a new battery.  However, at 67000 miles I had to have the front struts replaced and the O2 sensor.  I hope to keep it for 100,000 miles."

Brakes have been replaced 4 times and I only have 66K miles. Thought the sunroof leaked since we bought it. After 5 years of replacing the windshield, fixing the sunroof and several other things the car still leaks inside. Today we realized there are seals above the doors on the body under the rubber that are cracked and gone. We sealed these holes with silicone and when it's dry hope this will fix the problem. 1 window doesn't work, 1 sliding door doesn't work. The dvd player goes black at times. The paint is coming off all buttons, radio, heat/ac buttons. Waiting for what's next. Do not trust this car."

Doors were opened and shut over 20 times a day and shut down and started several times daily -- no malfunctions.   Under heavy load, the van performed flawlessly -- no power loss. The overhead rack was a godsend for carrying bulky items. Have taken other trips including Yellowstone for camping expedition. Performed regular maintaince.  Had to replace the right front tie rod, the EGR valve, and the differential cover. The original tires was rated for 50,000 but replaced them at 85,000 which was a real surprise.

I've loaded it to the gunnels, pulled trailers, have three kids, a german shepherd ... nothing breaks ... nothing.

I refer to it as the ""mother ship"" and it has been used extensively for hauling my child and friends everywhere.  My van has 97,000 miles and has had mainly normal maintenance.  My biggest complaints are the brakes (reworked at least 3 times with 7 sets of brake pads..and needs it again) and my battery.  I have now replaced the battery 3 times.  My husband blames it on the power drain because of the doors.  Also, I have had some issues with shocks/struts and now have a grinding/clicking sound when I turn steering wheel sharply.

The problem I had was with the Transmission. New remanufactured tranny was put in by the dealer under warranty at 67K. Small fluid leak afterward that was fixed at no cost. The front end makes a rattling noise when going over small bumps suspect there is something loose. In 90K miles I have avg. 20.6 MPG since new! Side of seat drink holders broke within a month of new. Not kid proof and somewhat flimsy. Same for the wireless headsets. Overall I would give the vehicle a 6, would have been an 8.5 minus the tranny and accessory problems."

Stow- n-Go is great, but other cost cutting moves range from annoying (loss of instant MPG function on trip computer, no 3rd row floor mat) to bothersome (poor lighted mirror & no extender on visor) to PITA's (no windshield deicer, 4-way only power passenger's seat-NO HEIGHT ADJUSTMENT!!!!).  Paint job (extra cost inferno red) was POOR. Above annoyances are inexcusable on a $38K van.  Do NOT waste your $$ on the Limited. Otherwise competent during normal driving (though suspension a bit soft), quiet except during spirited acceleration."
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,sr bruce, 03/31/2005,my butane blue t & c,4,"This is my 4th minivan.  I drive them for 60,000 then buy a new one. The 2005 sto'n'go is vastly superior to the previous 3(all of which were chrysler products).  There are many new features of convenience and comfort. I particularly like the a/c, the automatic doors, radio, cd player and navigation system, the console between the front seats and the sto'n'go seating. The limited is great."
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,S.Adams, 03/31/2005,Poor Qa control,3,Upon delivery the van had a blemish in the dash pad (replace dash pad) lights in vanity mirrors didnt work (fixed) rear speaker cracking noise (replaced) drivers side roof would colapase due to temp.change no foam support when built (replaced foam to support roof) This is why its hard to buy American made any more and this may be my last.
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,john , 03/31/2005,Best minivan so far,4,"This is our fourth chrysler minivan and it is the best. It is quieter, more comfortable than any other and the stow and go seats are nothing short of terrific.  Fuel economy has been a bit of a disappointment, but otherwise an excellent vehicle.  "
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,Dennis Baker, 04/09/2005,Very Happy so far...,4,"Very quiet. Better that expected handling. Practical yet comfortable interior layout. Seems more solidly built than my old one, a 1992. Seems a good value for $20K. Initial gas mileage a bit of a dissapointment: 16mpg city. Haven't taken a trip yet. "
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,Bob Rose, 04/12/2005,Not a Chrysler anymore,2,My wife hates the seats they are hard. Had a hitch installed and now the body structure is loose on the Rear fender where bumper connects to fender. In other words A Chrylser used to be the top of the line of everything but no more.
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,Neal Martin, 04/15/2005,2005 Chrysler Town & Country Limited,3,The larger 3.8 liter engine is a vast improvement over the 3.3 liter of the Dodge van I owned previously.  It has more horsepower and I have even been getting better gas mileage besides!  The seating does not allow long items to be slid under them. I rarely removed the seats in my old van so I dont have much use for folding seats.  There is a loss of about 1 ½ to 2 inches of head room in the front seats as compared to my old van.  Even with the seats in the fully down position I find that I have to partially recline the seat back so my head will not be touching the ceiling.  The van is designed more for the 100 pound tiny soccer mom than the average to larger sized driver.
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,NY Mom, 04/29/2005,Comfortable van for family,3,"This is my first Chrysler product and overall, I am enjoying the T & C.  I like the automatic doors, although they are loud.  It's very comfortable and roomy.  My kids & I tested a few vans, and they felt that the second row seats were the most comfortable - I agree!  Love the DVD player.  The sound quality of the stereo is poor.  The biggest complaint is that when I am going out into traffic, sometimes my wheels do not grip (the roads are not wet or slippery)and they spin.  It does not do well in snow."
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,tinum, 05/04/2005,Better familly car than any SUV.,3,"We have been driving this van for 6 months now, and we still love it. We had a 2000 dodge caravan before that had many problems ( thank you extended warranty ) This van is a lot more quiet and handle a little better.  "
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,njvan, 05/18/2005,Exceeds Expectations,4,"Excellent steering and handling. Has very good power with a smooth 3.8 Litre V-6. Get's around 16 MPG in town and 24 MPG on the road in mixed terrain. My wife is small, so the Sto-N-Go second and third row seats are the easiest we found to configure in any minivan. We have the Limited with very comfortable leather seats. The auto headlights feature, DVD player, and backup warning are excellent features. Good visibility and excellent sound system make driving this vehicle a pleasure. Braking is also excellent. The engineers have done an excellent job on this model. No problems so far on this model. It's worth driving to compare with Honda and Toyota vans. Got more for the money."
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,Amy, 05/31/2005,Awesome minivan!,4,"From a 99 Windstar to the 05 T&C Touring. Have had it now for 3 months and we are extremely pleased. The Stow & Go seats are wonderful. We had to take the seats out of the Windstar several times and they are so heavy. This is easily done now.  Our Chrysler dealership is a 5 star and they were wonderful. Highway gas mileage for us has been 22, city, 16 or higher. Most of this depends on how the vehicle is driven. We love the power hatch and doors. The Infinity speakers sound great. Wish the second row windows would open.  Love parking assist, DVD, and leather seats. I recommend buying the slush mats at least for the front and middle row, which are easier to clean.  A luxury minivan!"
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,Marine02, 06/09/2005,DodgeGC SXT,4,"This van is solidly built. Not a rattle or air noise. So far, everything has worked perfectly. It has very good a/c and I need it in Arizona's 110 plus summers. The radio works well and has a good sound to it. The side doors work easy no matter if I shut them by hand instead of using the motor."
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,J. Hart, 06/25/2005,Needs Improvements,3,Rear bucket seats are extremely uncomfortable for adults and very hard to get out of.  The third row seating is ridiculous! Stow and Go should be an option. Give me back my old second row seats with the option of Stow and go seating. I would much rather have comfortable bucket seats back for the second row for adults as an option.
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,Jen, 06/29/2005,Love this van,4,"I had traded in my 2000 Ford Windstar for this T&C.  Love this van so much better.  Had a lot of little problems with the automatic doors in the Ford and when they didn't work were very heavy to shut.  I love that the seats fold away and we actually use this van to go to Home Depot more that we use our truck.  I've had the 2005 T&C for over a year and have never had any problems with it yet.  I will definatly buy another T&C when we need one.  Best yet, we purchased this van for cheaper than the competitors and we love it."
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,teacherdan, 07/25/2005,Chrysler T & C,5,"We bought our T&C used, but you could not tell it other than the odometer.  Stow n Go is great.  A/C stands up under South Carolina summer heat of 95 and humidy of 95%, and the three zone control is wonderful.  The keyless entry system works perfectly.  It has saved me many awkward moments.  Fit and finish are superb...as good as many high-priced foreign models."
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,MAK, 07/26/2005,Best of last four,4,"This car is very quiet, and easy to drive.  Mileage is 18 in town, to 26 on the road with A/C on.  Panel fit is very good.  The pebble leather seats do not help you slide out like the slick seats of older models.  It does help hold you in place when driving.  The fold down rear seating is really great.  Easy to use, and quick to change.  If you use a van for many tasks, I recommend the Stow'N/Go feature.  "
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,Hawkeye, 07/27/2005,Ergonomics,3,"Bought the T&C in 12/04 as husband is 6'7"" and the Odyssey and Sienna did not fit him. Have 5000 miles on it. The ergonomics of the front dash, radio, dvd, a/c, etc. are terrible. The knobs/buttons are small and the workings of the radio are not intuitive at all. A/C worked very well during this recent heat wave. Have had the right motor replaced on sliding door and closing mechanism on left sliding door replaced under warranty. Like the room. Can pack a ton of stuff in it. Stow and Go very easy to use. Ride is nice. Could be more quiet, like the Odessey. "
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,Stan, 09/13/2005,Good van for the money,3,"Lots of power (3.8 engine).  Gas mileage 23-25 on highway, 10-13 in town.  Front seat comfort very good, second and third row seats are terrible.  Can't sit in them with a bad back.  Ride quality is better than Honda and Toyota especially on rough roads.  Sound system (6 CD in-dash) is wonderful. Much better overall value than the Honda and Toyota.  Bought this van for $7000 less than I could have bought a comperable Toyota or Honda.  May not quite have the resale value of the other two, but I would rather have the extra $7000 in my pocket.  "
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,Mark, 09/22/2005,Our 3 Town and Country ....,4,This is our third T&C; each is better than the last; we traded to get the new seat storage.  Very simple to operate with little effort.
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,joe Fernandez, 09/22/2005,town and country review,4,"The car drives very well on the open highway, I've taken over three long haul vacations using my town and country and I find the ride to be a great experience and the car very reliable on long travelled distances.  "
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,Donna McDonough, 10/09/2005,Touring,4,"I got the captain's chairs in the 2nd row. Much more comfortable than the standard seats. Gas mileage could be better, but since I do mostly highway driving I can live with 20-21 mpg. Already had to take van back to dealer to get the electric doors fixed, after only 3 months. They said they couldn't find anything wrong...hmmm... they were working again though when I got it back. Makes me wonder if maybe there is a general problem with the doors? No further problems since then though. The ride is great. Steering is really good too. I was worried about getting into smaller parking spaces, but the van can make a tight turn really well."
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,KC, 10/27/2005,Beat Minivan on the Market,4,We were on vacation this summer and rented a Town and Country.  We loved it so much we bought when as soon as we got back.  Extremely comfortable and fun to drive.  The best touring ride out there.  We got the power doors which are a godsend when loading and unloading kids and supplies.  Plus the stow and go seating is amazingly easy.
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,Ravis, 11/05/2005,Noisy,3,"Bought this van new. After 2 weeks, constant chirping noise from engine compartment. Been to dealer 4 times with no resolution to the problem. Leave overnight and we will fix it. Not good for Chrysler's image. I will be looking at the Honda on Saturday."
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,ShanaWoody, 12/12/2005,Not Reliable,2,"I bought this van as a program vehicle so it came with miles already on it.  I've had it for less than a year and already there is rattling in the dashboard, the rear stow-n-go has broken, the bushings and sway bar need to be replaced and the last straw was when a few nights ago it died on me and wouldn't restart.  I had to have it towed to a repair shop and am still waiting to hear on what has cause this van to die on me.  We've preformed all the recomended oil changes and taken care of it, so I'm not sure what to think.  It's no longer in it's warranty, so I'm having to fight with the extended warranty company to get everything fixed.  Wouldn't recommend to anyone."
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,sanjay, 01/03/2006,does not hold on slope,3,"Gas mileage: 13 on city: 21 on freeway Like the cruise control, it works well on uphill and downhill. only problem, if you stop on a signal and even if there slight downward slope. the moment you release brake, it goes backwards. you would have to switch very quickly on form brake to gas. I had to practice not to press gas too hard in panic.  I have 95 fold explorer which holds the round pretty well on even bigger slopes."
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,Ed, 01/03/2006,2005 Town and Country,4,We have really enjoyed this minivan. The stow and go seating is incredible. I've loaded it down and towed it many times.  Very versatile vehicle for our growing family.  Very glad with picked it over the  others.
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,steve, 01/03/2006,not quite sure yet - followup to come,4,"Have had previous chrysler mini's, and all served well. Bought this one for 4K under blue-book. Enterprise Rental vehicle sold at a Saturn dealer w/ 30K miles. Thank goodness the warranty is still in effect.. have had the car in 3x for power-lock system failure. Returning to Chrysler dealer in 2 days for faulty component replacement (so 4th trip for same problem). Now, passenger power window doesn't work. Some bugs to be expected for 1st model year of major re-design. Hope that problems can happen over next 1000 miles while still in warranty. Otherwise nice car, with lots of good features - especially Stow-n-go seating."
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,WILLIAM, 03/11/2006,Excellent,4,"I have owned Lexus, Escalade, Expediton, trying to find the perfect vehicle for my young family. This is by far the best! I could afford any vehicle I wanted, but this is the only one I would own. "

chrysler,town-and-country,2005,James R, 03/15/2004,BEST RIDE and DROP SEATS no lifting,5," This touring van takes you on a 1100 
mile trip without being stiff and sore. 
With the new reninforcement in the 
floor the vehile gives a firm (steady) 
and Quite ride. I have tried to buy a 
minivan before but didn't feel as safe 
as a big van. This Chrysler Town and 
Contry Touring Van saved me 100 dollars 
on my insurance because of its safety 
rating and good gas milage even with 
the bigger engine running through the 
mountains fully loaded. All the back 
and middle seats fold easily into the 
floor, no lifting is a miracle."
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,Corto, 03/19/2004,First minivan,4,"Two kids now meant first minivan.  I

Fe and a lot quieter."

We drive to many college visits in great distances, and have not experience one disappointment in reliability.  Others may boast of Honda or Toyota, but we are VERY happy with our Town and Country minivan.  We would recommend it to anyone, anytime!"
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,Live4Christ, 03/31/2004,I am Highly Impressed by DaimlerChrysler,5,"What a great Vehicle. The Stow n Go 
seating is Phenominal. Awesome horse 
power from the 3.3L V6. It's got the 
get up and go of a sedan but your in an 
elegant Mini Van that is very classy. I 
Love this vehicle and I hope you enjoy 
it to. Oh and you'll melt right into 
the seats, they are very comfortable."
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,jrinpr, 06/28/2006,Happy overall,4,"Has been very reliable, and is definitely a wonderful people hauler.  Stow 'n Go seating/storage system is brilliant, a 10-year-old could operate it with ease.  Everyone who rides in it seems to like this van, even my father-in-law who'd rather be drawn and quartered than be seen in an American vehicle! :)"

chrysler,town-and-country,2005,Van dude , 04/07/2004,Better than large SUV,4,"We are extremely happy with the '05 
T&C. The fold away seats are breeze 
and the cabin space is roomy. Much 
more manuevering room in the van, 
better than the large SUV's.  The gas 
mileage is much better too.  The 
automatic doors are convenient for 
children and when you need the extra 
hand."

family, and enjoy the luxury feel!"
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,Cyndi Shurtleff, 08/08/2006,What I think...,4,"i purchased this car to have more cargo room for my childrens activities. I like the doors on each side and the stow and go seating. I would like the seating to be stowed more easily, perhaps with a push of a button. it would also be better if it could be like the Toyota's and make it a Hybrid."
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,Phyllis Jones, 08/09/2006,2005 Chrysler Touring Mini Van,4,"This has been a very good vehicle so far.  We have had no problems except that the air conditioner is very slow to cool and does not get cold.  We are hoping that this can be corrected.  Easy to drive and moderately confortable in front seat.  Back seats need to be made more comfortable, (softer)! Fuel economy needs improvement."
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,Town and Counry Van , 08/17/2006,excellent for our lifestyle,4,"we have found that emergency handling has been excellent for this type of vehicle.Fit and finish is better than most.The stow and go seating has been used often and very sucessfully by both men and women. This is our second minivan and this model (limited)is complete without any options. The Navigation System is easy to use. We have had no trouble inspite of having a vehicle with a lot of ""gadgets"". It is super reliable and very comfortable."
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,Joe Middleton, 08/23/2006,We like it !!,4,"My wife and I were looking for something to replace (because of gas milege) a 2001 Dodge Durango. We looked at some other mini vans. WE had never owned a small van and the only other van we had owned was a full sized Voager back in the 80s.We enjoy the room for 7, because of grandkids. The MPG is comparable to the the imports (if you can get their owners to tell the truth). I have traveled on several trips here in Texas and I have got 25 to 26 MPG (once with five adult passengers). We thought that we would never own a ""soccer moms car"" but we do and we really enjoy it. "
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,Omahajim, 05/01/2004,Worth every penny,5,"I traded in a 1997 Ford E-150 
conversion, and we don't miss the extra 
room.  You could remove the center 
captain's seats on the E-150, but the 
back power bench seat would not come 
out, so even being a big van, was not 
very handy for cargo.

With the S&G seats, the T&C beats the 
pants off the old E-150 for 
convenience.  Fold all the seats into 
the floor, and you can carry full 4'x8' 
sheets of plywood or whatever.  

Yes, the seats are smaller and thinner 
than previous years' models (in order 
to fold flat), but they are very 
comfortable.

The 2005 Chrysler T&C Ltd is absolutely 
the best van on the market - period."
chrysler,town-and-country,2005,bobo123, 05/02/2004,Very Impressed!,5,"Love the fold flat seats.  Finish

It's as fun to drive as a minivan can 
be and soooo comfortable.  The Limited

all the ""little"" things that weren't 
great on my old van.  We didn't get 
our money out of an extended warranty

automatic doors are terrific.  Our 
driveway is on a 45 degree slope, so 
the automatic doors are a must for 
loading and unloading young children.  
They work perfectly.  The 3.8L engine

orginally wanted to buy a Toyota 
Sienna but for the price I would pay 
to own one, I wouldn't get a lot of 
the features I wanted unless I got the 
XLE. Not to mention, their option pkgs 
were expensive.  The Toyota 
salespeople weren't trying to let go 
of their Siennas without the customer 
paying a lot over invoice. I was able 
to negotiate some of them down but I 
still wasn't satisfied. Toyota has a 
good reputation for reliability.  I am 
a former Toyota owner and had my 
vehicle for 14 years. However, I got a 
great deal on my T&C and I'm very

engineers were listening to the less-

recommendations from previous model 
years of this van.  As an engineer 
myself, it is apparent that the fellas 
did some real brain-storming and 
creative-thinking.  Very comfortable 
to drive, especially for those long 
road trips.  Parents will absolutely 
love the rear DVD system, no more ""are 
we there yet?"" The only other option I 
wished I would have gotten was the tow 
package.  I evaluated all the mini-

chrysler,town-and-country,2005,John from PA, 07/22/2004,Very Posh for a MiniVan,4,"We have owned a Ford Winstar and a 
Dogge Grand Caravan and the T&C 
Limited edition puts them all to 
shame. It is very stylish, extremely 
comfortable, and packed with nice 
amenities.  My only knock on the 
vehicle is that it has already been in 
the shop for several ""minor"" repairs - 
most notably some of the trim coming 
loose and one of the seat controls not 
functioning as well as a loose belt or 
something which caused an annoying 
noise.  Otherwise, I'd highly 
recommend the vehicle.  We looked at 
the Toyota and Hondas, but couldn't 
justify the difference in price.  We 
did buy the extended bumper top bumper 
warranty - just in case."

Villager with another mini van 
primarily for hauling cargo not kids.  
When my wife saw how easily the stow 
and go seats work, that ended it right 
there.  The Toyota Sienna may get some 
accolades, but I couldn't get past the 
Darth Vader helmet center dashboard 
and the plasticky look and feel to the 
interior.  The T & C looks sharp on 
the outside and inside, drives 
terrifically, and is incredibly 
versatile.  I thought the power doors 
and tail gate were kind of gimmicky 
but now that I've used them, have 
grown to love them. "

throughout the mountains of Colorado.  
The vehicle got terrific gas mileage, 
though it did not have as much power 
as it should, perhaps due to the high 
altitude?  

Stow and go seats were terrific. Ride 
and control were top notch.  Power 
sliding doors were not really that 
useful, and while the power rear hatch 
was a nice feature, I would probably 
skip both of those features for cost 
and reliability purposes."

excellent handling.  Had the vehicle 
about two months and took a family 
vacation from Maryland to Vermont 
(about 500 miles).  Seats were very 
comfortable, both front and second 
row.  Dad could even sit in the third 
row seat in comfort!  Stow & Go seats 
came in handy for the trip, as they 
could be easily folded into the floor, 
then popped up again later.  Styling 
is beautiful - clean lines - not 
overdone and doesn't look like a 
Japanese insect.  Like the storage 
wells in the second row, which is 
handy for emergency items like jumper

out. While our Chrylser does not have 
all the whistles and bells of the Kia 
EX, it does have the magical Stow and 
Go seats... 
Even grandma can make the seats 
disappear in a flash. Since we live

have the front seats moved completely

storage bins for kids stuff when not in 
use).  However, the new model lacks in 
a couple of nice features of other vans 
on the market and (for those who've 
owned previous Chrysler/Dodge/Plymouth 
vans) has been cost reduced everywhere!

Lousy Cost Reductions:
1) No front windshield electric 
defrosters to keep the snow and ice 
from building up on the wipers...

2) No covers on the 3rd seat storage 
bins

3) only 1 lift gate light

Similar priced Honda or Toyota, would cost up to 10K more.  Saved the money and purchased an extended warranty.  My wife and I love the comfort, ride, and overall feel of the vehicle.  The remote entry, tinted glass, smart airbag in the front seat, grocery hooks, hidden pullout drawer, lumbar support, car mats, sliding door warning, are all pluses for the base model. Many of these things are optional on other brands and would have cost me another 1K.  My first Chrysler, (had 3 Hondas prior) and so far I am very impressed.  If you dont mind negotiating, you can really come out a winner! "
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,Alex, 03/28/2016,The practical people mover for the long term,4,"This is my third Chrysler Product. I had a 94 Grand Caravan. Great engine but poor transmission that required rebuild at 90k miles but the car lasted as a whole until 180k miles with routine maintenance and was still drivable when I donated it to charity. I then had a 2001, where they added a transmission cooler and fixed the transmission issues. The 3.3 Liter (and it's cousin the 3.8) are now powerful engines especially if moving a nearly 5,000 lb car, but it's not meant to be fast. Good torque and the O.H.V engine design keep things simple, and costs down for repairs. This simpler engine has been around for a very long time, and it's fairly easy to service.  But at 180 HP for such a heavy car, it' s very slow.  I now bought my Mom a 2006 Town and Country,  the upscale version of the Dodge Grand Caravan. I feel that in the used car marketplace, the Town and Country is priced nearly identical to the Dodge Grand Caravan but in initial purchase, they are 10k to 15k more in price for not much more in features. I think that if you are buying it without power sliding doors (less that can break) and without a lot of fancy electronics there is less that can break. The best feature of this car is the stow-and-go. You can convert it to a errand car for trips to Home Depot very easily. Another thing not often mentioned is that if you have large dogs, like German Shepherd, or Mastiff, this car's ability to put the rear 60/40 bench seat down and put a dog carrier in the back, is a great way to carry large pets, especially with a lower step in height. Did you ever try to help a 12 year old arthritic dog into a cross over or SUV and help lift such a heavy dog into the tall load floor? 

For me, my Minivan is my go to car for long trips, or for trips to get paint, or sheetrock. The cost of not renting a truck is very handy.  I think it's a fantastic practical car. It's not particularly fast, but it's a well known design and it's been around forever. I had to replace the water pump at 60k miles. I strongly recommend any new owner change the transmission fluid at 60k miles and again at 120k. You need ATF+4 and make sure Chrysler does it, not some cheapo oil change, as this car is very sensitive to having the correct transmission fluid. Stay on top of your fluid changes for the tranny with these cars.  I have over 100k miles and I mostly had little annoying problems, like door switches and window regulators, but not major break downs. Basic upkeep of new tires, brakes, frequent oil changes. I recommend changing the PCV and EGR valve at the 75,000 mile tuneup, as these parts are not expensive, and can keep car running smoother longer. 

Overall, it's one of the lowest cost-of-entry in the used car marketplace and cheaper than a Honda or Toyota Sienna while offering all the same value. I like this older body style compared to squared off new version. I also like the fact that they kept the same engine and transmission around for a long time, unlike Kia that went for a well known 3.8 DOHC engine to a 3.4 Liter with variable valve timing in only 10 years. To me, keeping the same basic engine and transmission around for 3 decades helps keep costs down both during purchase and repair time. Overall, not a fancy car, but a very practical car. I recommend.

Then I get a 2002 Chrysler Town & Country with 70K I replace the power steering pump, that is a problem with this van, new battery and brakes. Now I have a 2006 Chrysler Town and Country and the only problem I have is the power steering pump again. I thing the van are excellent, There are not a perfect vehicule,"
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,Ralph Gerber, 11/02/2006,Great Vehicle to Drive..!!,4,"VERY roomy, even without the ""fold into the floor"" seats. I'm handicapped and getting in & out of my previous vehicle (2001 PT Cruiser) was a real chore.. excellent response to the gas pedal, easy to park and maneuver in tight places (this minivan has a tighter turning radius than the PT did!).  

excellent radio/CD/tape unit and great sound from the speakers..windshield wipers were hard to operate at first (stalk-mounted controls always gave me fits!)..in all, even though it was the bottom of the ""luxury"" class, it had all the appointments I needed..my advice-if you need a vehicle that's roomy, nimble and easy to operate--buy this one..!!"
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,hmacks, 10/01/2013,220K miles of good times,5,"The 3.8L is awesome. We've gone through three set of tires, a new radiator (did it myself) a cooling fan, and 4 sets of brakes plus a set of belts. The car drives like the day we bought it. AC IC cold, stow and go is great. One of the automatic side doors stopped working but no big deal. Countless trips of +2500 miles with confidence. Cannot ask more from a vehicle except making it to 300k miles. Most comfortable best riding vehicle I'v ever owned . Tows our big boat well"
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,JANICE JACKSON, 09/03/2016,good ol nellie,5,"I have owned this car over 10 years, it hasn't given me any problems. The ride is so comfortable and when people get in and see the luxury it has they can't believe it. this has been the most reliable and cheapest car for upkeep I have owned. I have 150000 miles on it and it is still going strong. I have always kept it up if I have a small problem or any problem I take it right away and get it fixed. the oil has been changed every 3000 miles and the tires rotated every second oil change. I love this car but I wanted to get at least one more new one as I am 73 years old. I debated for two months and finally decided to get the new one. I am selling this one myself and hope that whoever buys it will take good care of nellie and enjoy her as much as I have. the gas mileage averages 22 miles a gallon, it has a 6 cylinder engine. In looking at several brands of cars I have had very little luck finding a car like I want with even that good of mileage, brand new. I use syntheic oil as the works are older and that makes everything tight again. It is a Chrysler town and country touring van and I got all the luxury items on it when I bought it. great car.

chrysler,town-and-country,2006,hamptonvan, 04/23/2012,Not as good as the '08-'12,3,"less power than the 4.0L, but smoother delivery than the new 3.6L-i still like th 4.0L best.
this vehicle does serve its purpose - the rear dvd is essential with a car full of kids on a long trip.
the gas mileage isn't horrible -I average 19.5.
I do like the (faux) wood trim, and the soft leather accents on the seats is a nice.
tranny is smooth, shifts well. 
I do like the styling of this version from the front better than the newer models.
the bads - all of the power door motors are LOUD, they work fine....the nav system is horrible - no touch screen, rotor dial for all intput.
no rear button for tailgate. much less cupholder/usable storage space-in the end-the '08and up solved all this"
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,Mikey, 03/01/2017,Oldie But Goody,4,"I bought my T&C when it was just turning nine years of age. It had 64,000 miles on it and it had been used by a suburban soccer mom type from northern NJ. It had a few issues but basically it seemed like a solid vehicle that ran good. I had to have the rear brakes, air conditioner and water pump repaired, plus a few minor repairs that I did myself, and since then it has been as reliable as any vehicle I have ever owned. It's now 13 years old and has 75,000 miles on it. Obviously I don't drive as much as I did in my youth but that means I don't worry as much about gas mileage which hovers around 16 mpg, 23 on long trips. It burned a little oil until I switched to Mobil 1 and now it seems to have stopped burning oil. It has continued to be absolutely reliable. When something needs attention it doesn't leave me stranded.

The light comes back on before I make it home!  The dealer never told me that while the light is on the airbags will not deploy if you get into an accident. 4 years down the road and a new dealer before I was told about the danger, parts have been on order this time since April 2010.  Calling Chrysler consumer hot line doesn't seem to help.  They say they'll check on things and call you back but they don't.  I'm getting frustrated.  How long do I have to wait for a part?  In the meantime I'm driving a unsafe car. "
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,Scott Fast, 04/07/2006,Fleet vehicle,5,"This is my second Town and Country minivan that I've owned.  Excellent vehicle that is priced right, handles well, very versatile and reliable.  I've owned imports such as Honda and Toyota and I think they are way over rated.  I had nothing but problems with those vehicles. Keep up the good work Daimler-Chrysler. "
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,robert3199, 10/08/2011,06 Mini Van,4,"We bought the van new and have had very little problems, it has been very dependable, and comfortable vehicle. I am slightly disappointed
in the mileage 21 hwy, this is with correct air pressure in the tires, and new air filter. Coming from an suv I was just hoping for better. At the time of this review it is 6 years old with 78k miles, and the only problems have been a window regulator, and egr valve.
I would not hesitate to recommend this vehicle to a friend. 
Wish I had got the stow and go seating. Gave it an avg fun to drive, it is a mini van, and value on all new vehicles is a joke."
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,utgrad92, 02/24/2011,Beware of power steering problems !,3,"Search the Internet for town and country power steering and you will see that you WILL be replacing the rack and pinion, as well as pump. The next time you hear a whine when turning the shell, get your wallet out. 

There should be a recall on these there are so many complaints."
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,minimom, 10/11/2005,Happy with my choice,4,"I really like this 2006 T&C.  It is easy to get the kids in and out of.  There are only two things I would change.  The power doors are noisy and there is no Illuminating light on the slides for the temperature control. Makes it very hard to see at night. As for the doors I do like that you have the option to use them with out the power. My thinking is if the power part fails at least you can still open them. I love the stow and go, with 3 kids we always have more stuff than we know what to do with. Overall this was a good choice for the price.  I guess time will tell if it has any issues like its predecessor."
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,Mike, 08/01/2006,Back from road trip,5,"My wife and I just came home from a 3 week, 4500 mile trip. Left Denver, drove to Glacier Natl. Park down to the Grand Tetons, back and forth to Yellowstone, with luggage on top, 2 adults 2 big dogs, and 2 bikes on the back we got 21.3 mpg (pretty good) and not one hint of a problem. This is a comfortable, well appointed vehicle and I was particularly impressed with the performance of the 3.8 engine. I cannot find any fault with the van. A/C was going full blast, for the dogs, all the time we were on the road."
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,John Osterloh, 10/21/2006,Chrysler T&C Touring is an excellent buy,5,"Plenty of power with the 3.8 liter engine.  Other Toyota/Nissan/Honda minivans I have ridden in lack this amount of power, especially up hills and when fully loaded with passengers.  The van drives like a car.  Very quiet inside when driving.  The stereo is surprisingly good for a stock unit.  The Stowe & Go feature with all rear seats is a fantastic feature.  No more hassling with removing entire seats to make more room.  Automatic sliding doors and rear hatch are also nice features. Plenty of leg room for adults on every seat in the vehicle."
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,jmw, 07/14/2018,town and country away,3,"I have owned 2 t&c's and I love driving the one I have as I did the one I had.  the biggest problems: 1. power steering filter needs to be cleaned constantly or the whining sound is horrible. 2.  The electronic they do go - motherboards, radio, lights inside, and 3.  the paint jobs do not last.  my van now looks a lot older than it is, the rust is horrible on the edges.  the tinted windows have a ripple effect that is just horrible.   the back seats no leg room for people and if all the back seats are in there is very little storage room in the back.  I love driving it, long distance the gas usage is wonderful but in the city 15mpg is about the best I get.

chrysler,town-and-country,2006,Don, 06/01/2009,Excellent Choice,4,This is one of the most comfortable vehicles I've ever ridden in.  The bucket seats in the front and middle row are wonderful...closest thing to sitting in my living room as I've ever gotten.  Vehicle is responsive and handles well for a SUV/VAN.  Good visibility.  Lots of electrical outlets and cup holders.  Love the backing-up warning system.

Tested numerous 2nd hand Honda Odyssey, Toyota Sienna, Chrysler T&C.  Liked the T&C best, looks, comfort, fully loaded, and price.  Like it more and more each ride.  Been long distance, camping, around town, and always happy.  Bought at 20K miles, now just under 50K miles.  Brakes will need doing soon DIY).  Water pump went on trip to Canada, and had to resort to dealership.  Few minor issues with right sliding door."
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,jon, 12/17/2005,initial review,4,it is by far the most fun to drive van compared to toyota sienna and honda odyssey. test drove all of it and found chrysler minivans are still ahead a notch in the competition
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,Vanessa, 08/11/2006,Love It,4,"This van handles great, very quiet ride. Love the stow n' go...it's so conveinant and the seats are very easy to fold, just 3 simple steps. The interior is beautiful, driver and passenger seats are quite comfortable. Before purchasing the T&C, I was considering the Odyssey and Sienna. I wanted to purchase a van that was completley loaded and after test driving them all and comparing prices the T&C was hands down the best."
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,Elmer M. Boles, 09/28/2006,A Good Deal,4,"This is the first Mini Van I ever bought, and it won't be the last.

The ride is much smoother than my Hondas was, and a lot quieter also.  We are trading in our Accord this month also.  The new Sebring puts Honda styling to shame.  No more problems for me.

chrysler,town-and-country,2006,Nancy Evert, 11/14/2007,We love it!,5,"We love our new Town And Country!  We are so overjoyed with this van I can't even put it in words. We has a 2003 Honda Odyssey that was a pile of junk, to say the least.  Everytime we turned around it was having another reliability problem. The transmission started to slip at 15000 miles.  That should of gave us a warning.  No problems with our Chrysler.  No trips back to the dealer for anything. Couldn't say that about the Honda.  Test drove the Toyota Sienna.  Didn't like its weird styling.  We made the right choice."
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,Lab Van, 10/16/2010,Dogs and I love this van,4,I am very happy with my Town and Country. Handles great.Comfortable seating. Power when needed.Front brakes had to be done at 30k.I did purchase the extended warranty but so far so good. I had the middle row seat taken out as I bring my Labrador's to the lake or trips with us. 
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,Kathi, 11/21/2006,Great mini-van,4,"We purchased the 2006 Touring model as a used car - and love it. Our previous minivan (an earlier model Honda Odyssey) pales in comparison. It rides quietly & the engine performs well - especially noticeable on inclines. The seats are comfortable and there is plenty of leg room even in the third row. The Stow-n-Go system is a great feature, too. The storage behind the third bench is twice the size of our previous minivan. Also, the power doors & lift gate are an added bonus. We really upgraded when we went to this model!"
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,Kittyk, 10/25/2006,Replaced the SUV,4,"My van replaced the 4X4 Tahoe which got 13 mpg! It has finally broke in and the performance has perked up! Getting 21 mpg combo driving and got 25/26 (with wind pushing the side!) on the highway! It is by far the most comfortable van of them all. I hate minivans but out of all of them I looked at and drove, this one came home! Very pleased!!"
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,omughal, 08/15/2009,I trust the engine and thats it.,4,Most taxi drivers use this vehicle in Texas and say engine usually goes to 300000+ miles but transmission only good to 120000.  I've had a power steering problem within 2 yrs of new which I had to pay $250 to fix - apparently not under warranty.  Electric door locks on one side stopped working after 1 yr. I had to replace battery after 3 yrs.  Our 3 kids have given the car a battering on the inside but vast majority of trim still good.  My next car will be a Honda or Toyota.
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,I'mABeliever, 01/12/2010,Never Thought I'd Love A Minivan...,4,"We traded a Cadillac SRX in for our T&C and have not been disappointed since. We needed more room and we certainly got it! There are so many features to love about this van, that make it an extremely practical and fun vehicle to own. We have had several small problems with the van since owning it, but we also realize that it was used when we bought it! My complaints: the small motors- such as the windshield wipers and window motors, and the brakes. We have had multiple issues with our brakes from sensors going bad, to pads, etc. I do not ""ride"" my brakes, and while I do understand that it is a heavy vehicle, I did not expect to be continually having this much brake work done at only 40k mi."
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,Mda377, 06/23/2010,Great car couldn't ask for better,4,"This is our first Minivan and it won't be our last, My family and I bought a used 2006 T&C and so far it is the nicest most comfortable ""car"" we have ever owned, we thought about the Honda and Toyota but the perks of this van won out and we went with chrysler and we are so ever glad we did. The Dvd sound system is amazing and the power doors are so helpful when you have your hands full of baby items, even the stow and go compartment makes a nice little ""toy box"" to keep the car neat and clean but the kids have plenty to do on those long road trips we love to take every year. My husband loves the look of the Town and Country it was easy to see why this was a smart purchase for our family."
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,TCSguy, 09/06/2010,Never again,2,"We bought the van in 2007 from a Chrysler corporate fleet. Since then, it's gone through 2 power steering pumps, 1 rack&pinion, the sway bar and end links, a ball joint and the DVD player. It goes through brakes every 20K and now has a brake vibration that the dealer can't figure out. It pulls to the right and the dealer (Danbury Dodge/Chrysler in CT) told me ""they all do that a little"". Thank goodness I bought the extended warranty. Even so, the sway bar and end links were not covered under the supposed ""bumper to bumper"" extended warranty. I'm a slow driver and I've never gotten more than 20 mpg from it. I'd never buy another Chrysler or anything from Danbury Chrysler/Dodge/Hyundai/Kia"
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,D & J Hogan, 12/31/2005,Made the right choice,4,After a lot of research the town and country signature series touring was our choice. The ride is comfortable and smooth. The stow and Go is the best. The turning radius is very tight.Leather heated power front seats are very comfortable. Navigation takes time to get use to but I am sure it will be a great asset. 
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,Susan L. Carlucci, 08/05/2006,My new Town & Country Touring Stow 'n-Go,5,"My new Town & Country Touring Stow 'n- Go is the best minivan I have ever owned.  It has lots of extra features that now come standard on this vehicle.  It rides well with very little road noise.  It is particulary well suited for my activities, including Golden Retriever Rescue.  It holds two travel dog crates when the third row seating is stowed away.  There is also plenty of room for all of the items I have to carry for the dogs.  One of the reasons I chose this vehicle is for the rear A/C for the dogs."

Before buying another minivan, I looked at several other types of vehicles from SUVs to full and midsize trucks to sedans.  My wife has a 2004 Acura MDX that we thought we would use as our family vehicle and get me a cool car for a change.  But, after driving several different things, I decided the minivan is just the best configuration for families.  No other vehicle gives the combination of smooth ride, amenities, utility and safety. Truthfully, I was set on either the Odyssey or Sienna because of magazine reviews, but after test driving all, I honestly believe the Chrysler was the best choice."
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,T&C Convert, 01/17/2006,Town and Country Limited,4,I sacificed my GM Card credits and converted to the T&C Limited.

The van has been pretty reliable but I had to replace brake pads at 36,000 miles (I drive in Atlanta traffic, but don't ride my brakes). At 70,000 miles, the driver side CV Axle broke internally (boot not torn at all); had to tow van home & replace. The passenger side is popping; plan to replace this week before I get left on the side of the road again. Maybe a recall is necessary, since the dealership parts guy admitted that he's sold allot of them?  The lifters are noisy, maybe I should try a higher octane gas, as a previous review suggests?

The head gasket might be blown because it is leaking anti freeze what it appears to be from the heads. The gas tank has a hairline crack that wont pass emissions. The headlights turn off by themselves while driving at night every once in a while. A very common problem with the headlight switch in this car. The driver window wont go down anymore.

It's also been in for repairs 6 times during the past 8 months (once for an airbag warning light, 4 times to repair the DVD player-there are 2 versions of the DVD player and there was some confusion about which should go in our car, once for a recall repair and to check out some rust forming on metal parts of our stow-n- go seats (CHRYSLER SAYS THIS RUST IS ""NORMAL"" so it wasn't fixed).

We have taken the car in several times and they say there fine no problems. Eletrical keeps failing which includes the headlights, overhead lights, window motors, pasanger sliding door, assist parking, and plug ins along with sensors. The power steering has been replaced twice. The alternator has failed. The check engine light keeps coming on and no one knows why. Don't forget it will just fail in the middle of driving and can not find the problem. The van will burn oil as well. Bought the van from a dealer and everything was supposed to work. The dealer covered up the fact the van did not have real leather as the seats were cracked and covered up. The van started to rust in year three. Had to cover that up as well. Could not find regular car seats to fit in the car. I had to buy 500 (each) car seats to fit for the kids. There is no room in the back for their legs with small kids.

Hopefully the brakes I put on last longer. Have a warranty now but it has a two hundred dollar deductible. After reading all the reviews I will buy a better warranty and next time in about five years I will be buying a honda....what is up with the drivers side front seat it just stays in the up position .."
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,Chris, 06/05/2009,Short Wheel Base & Great Family Carrier,4,"Chrysler's decision to drop the entry- level, short-wheel-base version of the minivan is a truly stupid decision. It may help standardize manufacturing, but neglects fundamental demand for that solution.  We are fortunate to have gotten one of them (a great 2006 Town&Country) new for a very good price (under $14k), and cannot envision to get a newer model to fit in our tandem garage. Now, I also cannot find a single new model for less than $20k, and that includes fire-sales at axed Chrysler dealerships (6/2009). Like ours...  We average between 19mpg and 21mpg (purely freeway) with the 3.3L motor, and never had any problems. Just had it in for the 36k inspection. A perfect family carrier"
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,margo, 03/18/2010,Great van,4,"We traded a 2005 conversion van for this one, great deal. We love the stow n go feature, great ride, handles very well, good power with 6 cyl engine. I carried 6 very BIG people in the van,total weight of 1500 lbs and it ran beautifully for 200 miles to the airport. great hidden storage and carrying capacity.  I can get 21 mpg in city with careful acceleration, and avoiding jackrabbit braking and acceleration.  I get 27 mpg on highway by driving at 65- 68 mpg using cruise. Compared to our conversion van which got 15 mpg on the highways, I am a very happy mini-van owner."
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,theron, 04/09/2010,Hoped for more,3,"Wanted a newer American mini-van my wife could count on. Got the best us auto maker brand. The kids love the room. Great storage front to back. Stow-n-go is awesomely useful. But lots of little problems started coming up by 2008. Steering sloppy/harsh. Passenger sliding door lock stopped working. A/c stopped working this week (recharging failed, looks like evaporator bad, which means entire dash comes out $800 and it may still not work.)  resale value stinks - went from $24k to $7k in 4 1/2 years. Leery of taking long trips now. Looks like I'm headed to Honda and Toyota minivans to pay more. Hope to keep them longer! Still driving 97 Civic w/almost no problems to date. Hmm."
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,Dontbuythisvan, 05/27/2010,Lots of Issues,3,"When I bought my van, I had previously owned two other Plymouth Voyagers and a PT Cruiser. It was a big change going for the PT back to a van. It stalls out a lot. One time it even failed when I was backing down a steep hill and I had to throw on the parking brake to stop. My complaints are the sunroof stopped working, the stereo is cheap, and it had poor reliability."
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,Not bad, not great,I've seen better...,2,"This is strictly my wife's car. She liked the stow and go seating, which I agree is cool. It is about time an American company caught up with Honda, and even showed a little innovation! The interior is a little dated feeling in my opinion, but it's livable and comfy in the front buckets, almost comfy in the second row, not so much the third because of the lack of footroom."
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,pman1965, 02/17/2006,Went from Honda/Toyota to T&C,4,"Didn't expect to buy American car new. Loved the Odyssey which is the best ride feel (like a car) and on paper the best value (Sienna was too pricey), but with $2500 incentives and $1500 financing incentive, I paid $22K on what would have been a $28K Honda.  Since we'll drive it for 10+ years, I don't care about the depreciation issue. It drives great.  Power liftback is very cool and stow-and-go is great.  No regrets so far and I like not being like the 9 out of 10 cars which are Hondas and Toyotas out there."
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,Steve Stevens, 04/02/2006,Positive,5,Smooth clean ride. Everything is accessible. Good mileage for comfort level.
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,Doug, 06/10/2006,W. P. Chrysler Signature Series,4,"Purchased a Touring T/C with the Signature Series in Jan 06. My wife loves the two tone leather interior and sunroof that comes with that package of options. We compared Honda, Toyota, and Chrysler; each had plus and minus, but in the end the T/C was the van for our family. Driving down the highway, the kids are watching a video with the wireless headphones, my wife is listen to Sirius radio and I'm using the nav system to get us where we're going, priceless. Two oil changes later and zero issues. No buyer regret, we would definately do it the same way again."
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,Terri, 07/15/2006,Needs more accessable storage space,4,"I LOVE THE STOW and GO for Vacation. but for everyday use, we need more storage space for all my kids stuff.  my first mini van."
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,D. Julius, 09/19/2006,Truly a pleasure,5,"This is my third Chysler Town & Country. Although I have been well pleased with the previous two, this one is undoubtedly the smoothest driving, and the most versitle for traveling with the Stow & Go interrior of all.  Plenty  of get up and go, pleasant to look at, comfortable to exit & enter, plenty of room for anything you want to haul.  Couldn't ask for more in a versitle luxury vehicle."
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,E. Ellyatt, 11/04/2006,rate my own van,4,"I have been MORE than pleased w/ ride and overall comfort. Has a rather large turning radius, it is really my only fault w/ this vehicle. I also own the shorter version in a 1905 model. I found the ride in the shorter wheelbase 1905 model not as smooth as the longer version of the same basic van.Mileage could improve, but I bought a van, so I'm getting VAN mileage (MY FAULT)"
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,Greg, 11/05/2006,"Nice van, for the money",4,"This van 3,3 L engine is peppy and gets out of its own way. I have taken the van on short in state trips and around town driving, we've had very few problems. The few problems we had were minor, like the brake pad won't stay on the pedal and a nagging rattle under the dash. The engine pings on gas under 90 octane. The stongo is awesome the seating is comfortable for seven. I like its exterior style and upscale interior. The engine compartment is not cluttered and I can check the  fluids with ease and I can get at the spark plugs!. Ford vans require a big mechanics bill to replace just about anything under the hood and not much under the hood is easily reached either."
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,ec97, 05/04/2007,Great Soccer Mom Vehicle!,4,We purchased the van for our 2 children and traded in our small Jeep we were outgrowing. It handles very nicely and the best feature has to be the built in child seats. Love that! The only problem so far is we had to have the steering system replaced because it was shot.  Something we were not anticipating - luckily it was all covered in the warranty.  I'd just advise that you buy any warranty they offer. We did not purchase an extended warranty.  Now I wish we had.  Hopefully there will be no more problems with it.  Otherwise we will be trading it in.
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,dkgunte, 07/06/2007,2006 Town & Country,4,"Loved this car from the first time I drove it. We moved from Maryland to Colorado in March 2006 and drove 1700 miles across country. The 2 things that helped most were the integrated DVD and Sirius radio. I love being able to listen anywhere, and the DVD keeps the kids entertained when we cannot think of anything to do while driving. Got around 24mph loaded down on the highway (a little better then I expected)."
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,diappointed, 08/30/2007,both cv joints fell out at 39000 miles,2,"The van did not get the fuel mileage it is advertsised to get, not even close, the road noise is so bad it makes the ride unbearable, the right cv joint fell off with no warning that it was even going bad, the left cv joint reported by dealer to be bad but it is not leaking grease and the boot is still intact- the ball bearings have flat spots on them "
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,smichals, 09/24/2007,What happened Chrysler?,3,"Trouble from the beginning. Motors on sliding doors have been replaced - twice on passenger side. Brake problems - air conditioning not cooling adequately. Loose piece on steering column - told that it was supposed to be that way.  Our 2001 T&C has same piece and no rattling. Trouble with tire, from beginning - they just would not listen to me. Getting ready to take back in, because the sliding doors are not working correctly, yet!  Very discouraged. Chrysler, please take this van back. CD player has issues and they want me to remove and send to Chrysler - who are they kidding?"
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,nc240fd, 11/19/2007,Buy stock in brakes,1,Invest in a brake pad company if you plan on buying a Town and Country.  My T & C needed brakes every 8000 miles like clock work.  Most of these miles were highway miles.  The power doors are one problem after another.  Some times they wont open and other times they open by themselves.  The dealership knows the car is build like this so they milk every service for what its worth.  Billing the warantee company for worthless repairs and the costumer.  
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,jat co, 03/09/2008,bad brakes,2,"At 24,000 I have had to have my front brake pads replaced - from what I am hearing and reading, this is consistent with the Chryslers - original brake pads no good.  New ones should last longer - are made better.  What's with Chrysler!!!!!  So disappointed.  No, I am not hard on brakes and do not drive with one foot on the brake.  Guess if you want brakes on a Chrysler to last, do not drive in town!!!!!!  Never buy another Chrysler.......Sure am glad I bought the 100,000 mile warranty - what's to expect next............."
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,C. G., 08/18/2018,2006 Town and Country reliable but rusty,3,"Got used in 2011 with 21000 miles on it. I got it very cheap because it was starting to rust. After extensive rust repair, the rust was way worse than it had appeared. The vehicle is simply dissolving! This is the worst rust I've seen since early seventies fords! Other than that MAJOR complaint, it has been a good vehicle, only 47000 miles on it now. I'm from pittsburgh and all the town and country and caravans of this era are the rustiest vehicles on the road! I can't believe all the other reviews hardly mention the rust issue. Later models seem to have addressed the rust issue.

Tires go flat, leaking valves/tire pressure sensors replaced after 6th time in for repair, stalls all the time, won't start when cold, automatic doors jam, alignment done 3 times.   Nightmare of a vehicle, never have had so many problems and I bought it new. "

Now I have no air conditioning. Come on Chrysler do something about this, please. I spoke to the dealership recently, they may offer a discount on repairs but no guarantees as of now.  "
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,Texan Wife, 11/01/2005,Soccer Mom and Proud,5,"Bought our Chrysler Minivan after futile attempts with local Honda, Toyota and Buick dealers. Absolutely love the folding seats and power doors.  We're getting about 22mpg overall but mostly taking kids to school, band practice and YES - Soccer practice.  Kids are fighting over sitting in back seat to watch DVDs,  instead of the front seat next to mom?"
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,Tim Roberts, 01/08/2007,Very let down!,2,"We bought our T&C to replace our suv as our family car. During the first few months everything was fine. Then we started to have quality issues and reliablity problems. We have 24,800 miles now and already had to replace water pump, power steering pump and high pressure line, and idler pulley just went out! Now has trouble idling and runs rough with a/c or heater on. Dealer tells us now that the brakes have 10% left! We were planning to keep for 5-6years, but it looks as if we are going to trade out to another brand. VERY disappointed!"
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,Bay Area T&C Driver, 03/21/2008,Excellent Choice - Highly Recommended,4,"We are very happy with our 2006 Town & Country - great design and truly the best value for the money. For whatever reason they don't have our short-wheel base model in the latest (2008) T&C, the design also took a step backwards. We prefer our ""bubble"" design look.  The fuel economy of the 3.3 L engine is better than of its competitors (even the Honda Odyssey), but we barely get 20 mpg on average out of it. The motor is responsive and well- balanced. So far no issues with it.  The only design flaw we found is an unusual brake configuration: Our minivan has disk brakes on front and drum brakes on back - most brake job places have an ""all disk brakes"" in their database! "

chrysler,town-and-country,2006,unibody, 05/24/2006,Piece of metal scrap,2,"Very dissapointed! Gas mileage is awfully poor ( 15 mpg on combined, even after brake-in period). No extra loads, even removed the 3 bench to make it lighter. Ancient engine technology, that it!!  Look at the front doors- where the hinges are, you can see loosen electrical bundles, hanging like they're ready to snap out...Barely wrapped in cheap insulated tape...Oh my goood! Cheap flat plastic panels inside, with no niche for basic storage. AC went off ( and ""fixed"") twice, tranny jolts when decelerating, rust! On engine head, frt brakes calipers replaced.....Too many to mention. Don't buy,unless you have money to waste. Pay cheap, get cheap. Toyota and honda are the best by faaar!"
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,cddc, 02/01/2014,Lots of issues,2,"This Limited 2006 Town and Country has a lot of problems that any buyer needs to know about.

1.
To start, the mileage is REAL BAD.
I mean REAL REAL bad.
We currently are getting around 14.5 MPG for city driving with the 3.8.
That is a deal breaker for most.
2.
You may think that the seats are real leather on the Limited, but the leather is FAKE plastic leather.
If you want the real leather you need to get a Honda EX-L or some other van.
These OEM fake leather seats SUCK and look cheap.
And you are basically paying for leather with the high price they charge on a used car!
Use this fact as a big bargaining chip!
Real leather installation would cost $3000+ for all the seats Â "

We also had 4 adults plus all the luggage. My previous vehicle was 5005 Dodge truck which was costing me about 160 dollars a tank. I did like the truck but the expense outweighed everything else. 
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,rmonk92591, 08/01/2006,Two in a Row,5,Country Club Chrysler Dodge Sprinter sold us our van...we love it...why... adjustable pedals auto open doors system-cruise control like not other. Stow/Go seats are the best....so many options...you can sleep lying flat...no humps to deal with....pet have more room to rest while traveling... dual air is great.............. Leather seats are easy to take care of. Chrysler Dodge is ahead of the other designers- We also bought a Sprinter at the same time.....and this is our second T/C van.    
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,2006 Town & Country , 06/23/2008,2006 Town & Country,3,Good Car Except For Gas Mileage. When new got 20 mpg average. Now i get 13 mpg average. Its been to the dealer 8 times and i'm fed up. They tell me that nothing is wrong yet gas mileage dropped 7 mpg for no apparent reason. No Satisfaction from Chrysler so now I'm done with Chrysler.
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,DJ, 07/10/2008,Nice minivan,4,"We have over 31,000 miles on the van since fall of 2006, and there hasn't been one issue other than a replaced gas cap.  It provides a comfortable ride, especially on long road trips.  Good power outlets for the kids. The van gets better-than-expected gas mileage on the highway: around 27 mpg (even with 4 adults, 2 kids and luggage in tow).  When driving on short trips around town, we get about 19 mpg.  Not great, but still good considering the vehicle's size and carrying capacity. "

I hope this helps anyone with same problem"
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,MIles, 07/24/2008,Brakes last 12K Miles,3,"We chose the town and country because it was the only Minivan i fit into comfortably (6'4""). We have grown to really love it and I particularly love the stow and go seating.  However, it has been the least reliable car I have every purchased. The in the first 18 months of ownership we had to replace one tail light twice and the other once. The e-brake sometimes ""snaps"" and needs to be re-engaged (Dealership could not do anything about this) and the two front brakes wore down to the metal in about 12K miles and 20 months (warranty is 12K miles and 12 months).  The dealership told me I should expect the brakes to wear out significantly faster than Honda, Toyota, or Nissan."
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,george, 08/14/2008,"Horrible brakes, very poor gas mileage",3,"I bought this van new June 06 has the 3.3 L v6 short wheel base model. The gas mileage is terrible 15 freeway i couldn't believe it, my wife drives the car mostly and drives with the kids in the car. The front brakes squeak and make grinding noise a lot of brake dust, get very hot and wear out every 20,000 miles like clock work. The rack and pinion power steering was replaced at 25,000 miles, passenger sliding door power lock replaced at 30,000 miles, transmission shifts hard you feel every shift. Dealer has answer for all, everything is normal, front brake noise and wear  normal, 15 mpg freeway  normal. I think the dealer is full of blank. last Chrysler i buy. Dont buy a town & country"
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,notafanofthevan, 09/22/2008,Listen to the reviews!,3,"I wish I did more research when shopping for a van. I was pleased with the price tag and amenities I was able to get with my Town & Country. The initial investment may have been lower, but I have had the van 2 years and have spent WAY too much on servicing it since!!   I've had problems with the air conditioning, tires, brakes, air bags, sunroof and other ""unknown"" squeaks, squeals and plastic parts falling off in the interior. I tried selling the van once the repairs started occurring regularly, but the resale is HORRIBLE! I would have to pay out over $7000 to get rid of the van - so I am stuck with the piece of junk.   Do not buy a town & country! I will not make this mistake again!"
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,Vandriver, 09/27/2008,Piece of Junk,2,"What doesn't break on this thing.  In 46K miles the rear liftgate motor had broken, the dvd navigation unit won't read disks, the AC died, the windshield wiper motor died, the power lock solenoids are screaming, arm rest broke, rear suspension rubber stop fell off, 6 disc changer lost a channel, lower driver's and side door rubber seal fell off, dash speaker died and all the shocks/struts have worn out."
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,Mom with Van, 09/29/2008,Used to love my vans,3,"This is our 3rd TnC van and it has many comfortable features that make  long trips possible for a family of 6. I'm  happy with the larger 3.8 engine for acceleration and the mileage is OK at 19 mpg in town 21 on hwy. I do Love the stow and go bins. However, the AC went out at 18k miles (a known Chrysler issue & a 2wk back ordered wait for parts). Now 2 mths later the passenger sliding door motor is shot, the dash board lights are flickering like a strobe light, & a strange new humming in back? All under warranty, but also under 27k driven.  What's next! Yes, the factory brakes are garbage and need replacing entirely too soon. Don't wait if they squeak at all or new rotors will be in your future"
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,Usedtobeloyal, 01/12/2009,Power sliding door problems galore,3,I love the van and the power sliding doors and rear hatch are great for dropping the kids off at school. I do not think that Chrysler chose the best possible design as the rear hatch has been repaired twice and between the 2 sliding doors there have been 6 repairs. Plastic trim pieces on stow-n-go seats as well as driver seat have broken in just normal use. Engine and drive train are working great as a matter of fact if it weren't for all the power door problems I would have given the van a 10 for reliability. Paid for features should last as long as the vehicle.
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,Linda DiMichelle, 02/05/2009,Great Van!,5,"I had a Honda Odyssey before this that went through two transmissions, ate dvd players, rotors and pads were replaced every 5k miles.

chrysler,town-and-country,2006,stump69, 07/12/2009,Dependable and Comfortable,5,"The 2006 Chrysler Town & Country that we've had for nearly 4 years as of this writing, has been the most dependable of all the cars I've bought in my 40 yrs. of driving. In nearly 70K miles, I've had one tail-light burn out and that's all! It has a classy design, comfortable roomy interior and ours has the popular entertainment package that I really enjoy: AM/FM/Cassette/CD/Sirius/DVD all in one handy head unit. An absolutely brilliant combination. We- re never at a loss for entertainment on my commute of on family trips. It also averages 24.1 MPG combined city/hwy driving. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for style, comfort and dependability."
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,Kristine, 09/14/2009,Disappointed,3,"My van has about $46,000 miles on it and the A/C quit working.  To fix it will cost $1,100 - not something I'm willing to do on a 3 year old van.  Also, the sliding automatic door/lock quit working - that was $250 to fix.  Just replaced brakes which seems early to me, but find it's pretty common with these vans.  I was told that the outer tie rod ends should be replaced soon for about $285.  I've owned several cars and have never had to replace tie rod ends in the past.  This will be my last Chrysler product and the sooner I get rid of this one, the better.  Gee, I wonder why American car manufacturers are going out of business....."
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,ajs, 11/03/2009,5th T & C and Still Pleased!!,4,"I have had a lot of Chrysler minivans and while not perfect, I have no major complaints. Can't beat the room, ride, comfort and fuel economy package. 26 mpg highway/21 city. I run full synthetic oil in my vehicles and strongly recommend if you want the best mileage and long-term engine benifits. I strongly recommend the extended warranty. My advice to SUV users who never see dirt roads...This is a great alternative. Have just over 30k now and have ""not"" needed new brakes. If you are heavy on the gas pedal and heavy on the brakes, you will run through ""shoes"" as it is a heavy vehicle. It should be considered as a heavy-duty station wagon and ""not"" and SUV. This is a great family car!!"

Air bags went off and he was not hurt, however a minor wreck into a ditch ""totaled"" the car to my dismay.  I had 65,000 miles on it.  Power steering leaked, noisy breaks, but in all, a decent vehicle for a van....."
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,Thoslib, 01/03/2010,Mixed Bag,3,"Overall I am happy with the vehicle. Some minor things: Not enough interior lighting on doors, buttons, Passenger side door lock does not interact with auto lock. Can carry a ton of stuff and is perfect for family trips/ outings. Drive is smooth and satisfactory."
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,MrsBiss, 05/15/2010,Want to love it,4,"I bought my 3.8L 2006 T&C w/26k and put over 40k more on it within the past 2 yrs. A few weeks ago my enginr started making a noise when I started it and it lasted until it warmed up. Can't figure out what it is???? Then last week my water pump started leaking, we replaced it ourselves, but the other noise is still there. We have a feeling it's the power steering, reading all of the reviews on this vehicle. BUT all-in-all I love my van!! It's spacious, gets great gas mileage (22+/gal w/daily driving), has a LOT of pick up, and comfortable to drive. I drive to Pittsburg frequently and never get stiff from driving. I just wish they would put better quality parts in them."
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,Craig D, 05/26/2010,Used T&C Touring,5,We bought this van after our 3rd Chrysler van was totaled in an accident.   We could not be more pleased with vehicle.  Excellent road trip vehicle with kids.  Stow N Go seating is the best.   Never had trouble with transmissions on any Chrysler products.  Perfect for family.  
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,leesvan, 07/11/2010,Better than Reported,3,"Bought this van new. Its the second one. Had a 2001 LXi. It was much more plush than this Touring model. However, it has been trouble free to date except the front brake discs & pads needed replacement at 30,000. The 2001 brakes lasted 60,000 but they had original ceramic all around. That convinced me of the value of ceramic. Now for the good points. Most of miles are on the highway where believe it or not I drive at 67-70 mph and get from 24.5 to 31 mpg. Believe it. This van with a 3.8 L V6 gets better mileage on the highway than advertised for medium sized sedans. I must add that the 2001 van only had a electric window mechanism go bad and I was ""talked"" into replacing the water pump. "
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,HKM, 07/29/2010,Brake issues,3,For the most part I have really enjoyed this van. The paint job isn't great. I bought it new and it seems like any small bump will chip the paint. My biggest problem is the brakes with about 75000 miles I am already for my third new set of front brakes. The back which I had checked recently are fine. Have read other complaints about this and think something must be wrong. Otherwise I really haven't had to do much with the van other then regular maintenance.
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,Paul O, 02/10/2008,Solid and classy,4,"A great way to get around. Interior design is extremely well thought out and very comfortable. Although I do miss the storage of a console, this design is better because one can move around with ease."
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,Terry, 10/22/2005,Great Minivan,4,This is an excellent vehicle to transport kids in.  It has plenty of room and excellent storage places.  It is by far and away the best value of any minivan on the market.

chrysler,town-and-country,2006,Pete, 11/08/2005,Another Chrysler hit,4,"Purchased in late October. We did so after considering all the major ""competition"" -- Honda, Toyota and Nissan. In the end, there was no question -- we stuck with our Chrysler roots, trading in a 1999 Plymouth Voyager for the '06 with features that none of the competition can come close to offering at such a great price. We immediately took it on a trip to Williamsburg, Virginia and were pleased with every feature. This will be my wife's new vehicle so it had to meet exacting standards! It contains everything she needed -- a more powerful engine, multi-zone climate, power doors/tailgate, CD/DVD, comfortable seating, attractive styling. Awesome so far!"
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,WPChrysler Signature, 12/23/2005,A Great Experience,4,"Although this is our first Chrysler mini-van, we have owned at least 6 or 7 Dodge mini-vans and have never, ever had a mechanical problem with any one of them. Our last one was a beautiful Champagne color and was a 2001 model with only 32,000 miles on it, we are selling it in favor of the 2006 Chrysler because the sto n go seating is practical for our travels."

chrysler,town-and-country,2006,zagles9, 01/21/2006,T&C Touring,4,"Bought the Touring after looking at Dodge, Nissan, Toyota, Honda and Ford.  After trading in a 2004 Toyota Highlander I feel it was the right choice.  There is plenty of room to put people in the 3rd row, in the toyota someone had to climb over the seat or enter through the trunk, unless you wanted to take the carseats out.  Very nice have had many toyota, and for the price I feel you get alot more for your money.  The same equipment on other vehicles is 4-6 Thousand more.  All in all I feel this will work alot better for families than an SUV with a third row seat because of the captains chairs on the second row."

Chrysler offered a rebate that we could not pass up. I really wanted a sport-ute for the high up driving position but was avoiding the gas usage of a 4WD along w/ the high sticker prices on a foreign auto. We only have 940 miles on the van so far, so I hope the mileage gets better, but I fear the old ""breaking in period"" is an old wives tale. It was on the sticker as 26 hiway and we got under 20 so far! in town is naturally worse. how can they advertise it so far off? I had no weight in the van and didnt have the the air on. I love every other thing about the van, however! "
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,Marie, 06/20/2006,Step up from Grd Caravan Sport,4,"Recently purchased a new T&C - so far it has  been very good.  QUIET ride!   Love the steering wheel features for the radio, the 6disc cd/dvd player - no more fiddling around to put in a music cd once the the kids have fallen asleep from watching a dvd, and the stow & go.  Didn't think I would like the leather seats - but they have been very nice. Adjustable pedals!  A/C works great and having front/passenger & rear digital controls are good."

They have corrected the problems from the previous models (transmission).  The seats fold away very easily, giving me the ride of a car and the flexibility to use the car as a truck when needed.  We love the bucket seats in the middle row."
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,Lisa Lee Garner, 08/09/2006,Better mileage after break-in???,4,"I originally set out to buy a Honda, although I never buy foreign.  I was determined to get better gas mileage than the Jeep Cherokee Limited that I adored!  I also wanted more room.  The Honda was overpriced with fewer options and most importantly was uncomfortable.  The T&C was so plush and had every option to play with.  I love the power doors/tailgate since I have an 11 month old baby now and my hands are always full!  Hope the gas mileage gets better though.  I will update after break-in.  Other than that there is no other vehicle I could possibly like more, even the so-called luxury vehicles.  I fit 2 dogs, a baby, 4 adults, & a rooster in a large carrier into this van wiyh comfort!"

The trip in our new van was very enjoyable mainly because it was very comfortable to ride in because of the electric heated and multi position adjustable electric drivers seat. It also had a new feature called Navigation. It mapped out the best route to our home in Florida and gave us verbal and visual directions all the way down. It was a joy to drive this vehicle such a long distance and arrive feeling as if our trip had lasted only about half as long as it had felt on previous trips. Thanks"
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,Gary Scott, 01/28/2006,Y BUY 4N??? Chrysler Van is the BEST!,5,"Looked at and drove all of them, Finished up buying the Chrysler Touring.  Very comfortable on the road, and the family loves it.  DVD player for my grandson made a trip much shorter.  Mid 20's on fuel economy is good, Stow and Go seating is super.  Very safe for everyone.  5 Star safety rating gives much peace of mind.  Honda and Toy are pretty good, but to get one equipped like my Chry is way too expensive.  This is the best car I have ever owned, including several imports.  Kudos to Daimler Chrysler!!! "

My wife drives one, I drive one, my friends drive them. For @ $20,000 I defy anyone to find a more stylish, good handling and dependable vehicle. When I buy these I feel like its the greatest unknown secret. People pay $40,000 for a Honda van. Ypu could buy 2 of these for that."

We liked the looks of the new Pacifica but their lack of storage space made us look at the Town & Country and WOW!!! What a great vehicle and the Stow 'N Go Seats are AWESOME!  The Power doors and liftgate are great when your arms are full, and the Sirius radio and DVD plaver can't be beat.   THANKS"
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,seematt, 11/17/2006,Love my new van!,4,"I bought the van on ebay with 25K miles for 14K.  Satellite radio is a plus, good power, and 29 mpg on the highway, 23 mpg in town.  I just bought a queen pillow top mattress at Sams and it fit in with a little bending in the middle. Plus room for all the groceries.  I don't think the rigid box spring would fit...The Stow and go is great and very easy with the numbered tabs.  Good acceleration, but on a wet surface the wheels don't grab, so you really need traction control.  My next purchase will be for a touring or limited version.  If buying at a dealer, I'd get the console/floor mat options and have them thrown in for free,  ebay is tricky! and opt for the overhead rail system"
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,nicholas dimarzo, 02/02/2007,great van,4,"This is a great van. I like the looks of it, the interior of it. The handling is great. It's very comfortable. It has plenty of power, the stow and go seats are great."
chrysler,town-and-country,2006,RUSS CLARK, 02/15/2018,Super pleased second owner!,5,"Bought this van from an older couple who gave up driving and moved into a assisted living community.  It has running boards on it which makes it helpful getting in for us older folks and gives the van a distinctive flair.   This is the second 2006 T & C I have owned and it has not disappointed me in any way.

In March 2019, I sold this van to a young couple with three kids and they are super happy with it.  The young boy likes to keep it very clean and it gets washed each week.

Now it is September 2020 and everything I said earlier is still true.  Looks and runs as well as always.

Now while 80% is highway miles, the fact that this vehicle is still running good and strong means I have a well engineered vehicle. If anything gives me any cause for concern, I deal with it asap. I think the brakes are the parts I have replaced the most often and the front 3x more than the back. But, that's part of maintenance. Overall, I'm very satisfied.
12/302019
UPDATE: One of the kids ran the engine while low on water and it over heated. I have replaced both heads and radiator. That was 5 months ago. Aside from that I have just gone routine maintenance. The transmission is still good. Let's see if I can get another 100,000 out of it.

In the 3+ years since then it has been driven all over the US and parts of Canada and it has about 159,000 miles. All we've had to do is change the oil, get a tune up, and replace the spark plugs and brake pads (oh, and new tires, of course!). The interior is good, spacious enough for a couple of long family trips with our four teenage boys (3 of whom are 6'4"" or taller). The middle seat cup holders broke almost immediately, but that is just a minor inconvenience. The rest of the interior has held up very well! Overall, it's been reliable and comfortable. "
chrysler,town-and-country,2007,sos, 11/25/2006,Moderate Van,4,At first we were very impressive about its smooth drive but later on we found that it becomes bumpy. It could be we get used to it and don't feel the smoothness anymore. Overall it is a good van with the price but we would consider Honda or Toyota for the next purchase.
chrysler,town-and-country,2007,Beth Roscoe, 11/20/2006,Goodbye toyota,5,"I simply love my new Town & Country.  It has all of the features that I wanted.  I had a  2004 Toyota Sienna that i wanted to shoot a gun at.  After 11,000 miles the Toyota was rattling like it was going to fall apart.  The engine sounded like it had marbles in it.  The doors never closed right from the beginning.  I went looking for a new van, and after driving the Toyota and Honda, the Chrysler won hands down.  I want to trade my Accord for a new Sebring, too.  No more boring Japanese for me."
chrysler,town-and-country,2007,Xcoto, 08/29/2010,It's been a great car,4,"We've had next to no trouble with this van, our first minivan, and have had no major work done on it. I'm just now at 58,000 miles looking at a break job. I find it fun to drive with plenty of pickup, and it has shorter turning radius than our Jeep Cherokee did. The electric side sliders and rear door have been a great feature, too, since we let our dog out to run alongside in remote areas."

Catalytic converter replaced in 2011, O2 sensor in 2012,doors repaired, multiple electrical system failures( take it in and chrysler says they can't reproduce the issue). Brakes constantly have to be replaced.
Didn't pass emissions in 2011, 2012 without the major repairs (catalytic and O2 sensor), just today didn't pass emissions again.
More big repairs to come I'm sure, but I've learned my lesson.Chrysler, never again.
When I've checked on recalls, haven't found any.
I know I can't be alone.

I have owned sports car, luxury car, SUV and by far this is the best vehicle ever (comfort, storage, mpg etc) for this price. I was shooting for Toyota but could not touch anything with this year and mileage below $23000. Everybody is wanting more power. If you want to do passing at 80 mph maybe you need to consider sports car not a van. Rides like a luxury. "

I have complained to the dealer from day 1. they looked for leaks had me change a pump, some values. and then after my warrante was up they told me i should replace something major in the engine.
I believed it should still be warranteed because for 3 years they hav ebeen trying to solve the problem but they refused to do so. Now, in 2011 i change the catalyic converter in order to pass inspection $$$$$
In 2012 the engine light came on again for the same, i got it change again. it is now 2014 and it will not pass inspection because of the same issue. "

City mileage is 19-20 and on the freeway at 70-75 mph it gets 27+.
What else could you ask for??? Ride great, handling great, value great.
I've been reading the other negative reviews and I can only surmise that either they don't know how to drive or they make up stories to just get themselves posted. I have talked with oodles of Chrysler 2007 T/C van owners in my business and they give 5-stars reviews. As far as other reviewers, ""something smells fishy"" with their comments.

I drove each one of the company vans 90,000 to 110,000 miles with just one transmission repair. The only other maintenance on the company vans were brakes, tires and 5000 mile oil changes. I love my 07 van.  It is comfortable, drives smoothly and does fairly well on gas.  Being able to put a 4X8 sheet of plywood in the back is great. I truly love the van on trips, with all of the room and comfort."
chrysler,town-and-country,2007,Randall S. Brown, 06/15/2010,"Nice, but watch the engine",4,I would like to get better mileage but this is a people hauler.  We owned a Town & Country prior and ran it up to 150k only changing brakes and one AC before the brain went out.  This vehicle we have had for 8 months.  Now has 44k miles and I'm noticing it is using a significant amount of oil between oil changes.  Now I've found this is common for the 3.8 motor.  It wasn't common for the 3.3 but the 3.3 was short on power.  Be sure you are ready to add a quart of oil every 2 or 3k miles after you get to 44k.

Definition of intermittent, duh! So, anyhow, they refused to try and fix anything because they couldn't get it to repeat.  Honda dealer did actually keep looking and replaced an ignition switch and ignition lock but after all the crapola we had to deal with, we decided to trade it in for a new Honda.  Good riddance!

The car has been consistent, and a great travel vehicle carrying 2-3 dogs, and all their show equipment necessary - on the road for 3 to 4 days at a time. I've climbed mountains, pulled a popup camper, moved 3 times pulling a loaded 5x10 trailer cross country, up and down significant mountains ranging in height from 3,000 to 7,500 feet. At 156,000 miles, I have a small oil pan leak, and it gets a little tired going up steep mountains after an hour or so. Pretty good. Some are not so good, and some are good.

No above bars to assist getting in/out of vehicle, layout of radio and heat controls poor, window controls not good because very close to manual door lock. Seat is okay but behind neck is very uncomfortable. Tires have tread but terrible traction. Feel like vehicles not setting tight on the road. Radio poor reception. Vehicle often feels like it may stall and difficulty accelerating. Blind view areas. Layout of window defrost blows air in your eyes. Uneven dashboard near defrost vents and speakers causes bad reflections in sun. I strongly feel it will cause me to hit something on the right side."

Not only that, but there are no air conditioning vents in the back!! We had to get a clip fan from an autoparts store so my son wouldn't be so hot. Nobody warned me, also, that half of the van's value is lost in the first year, I paid 17k (+ some neg. equity) and a year later, I can't get more than 9k for it. 9!!! That's terrible.

Appears in order to find out the whining, hesitation and lack of getting up and go when you first start off, you have to replace a half of dozen parts to get to the real problem. The more research we do only believes us to one thing - big lemons. If anyone knows of an actual website for Chrysler that allows you to voice your opinion about their product please let us know.

It is basic with few bells and whistles, but the fuel mileage is great!  On a long trip of nearly 800 miles I averaged as high as 29.7 on interstate with three adults and two children in it!  (headwind and hill changes it quickly)  But there is no problem averaging 22.7 all around combined mileage.  Very pleased with the fuel given the high price of gas.  The interior is basic.  Mid-row seats are kind of small and not a lot of room between 2nd and 3rd row, but we were used to a full-size conversion and it is a 'mini-van.'

Tried to support American cars for most of my life. This car has me swearing never again.  Replaced a power window motor, the power steering motor and something else with in the steering wheel, had 2 bad tires (drove with a flat-sensor didn't come on), replaced brakes at 18K, it's in now for bad roof leaking in 3 spots and a sunroof rattle.  Door plates surrounding the power window buttons are rubbing down/showing signs of wear (I never use them!) and so are the seats--I have 25K miles on the van- -mostly from 3 long trips!! I haven't even had it 2 yrs.  Bad gas mileage-- not even 17 MPG.  Worst car I've ever owned! Poorest quality!"
chrysler,town-and-country,2007,minivan fam, 01/29/2010,07 T&C Touring Signature Series,4,"Bought out 07 in 08 with 15,000 miles. Now up to 45,000 miles and happy . . . for the most part. We bought an extended warranty, thank goodness! I just had a new motor put in this van!!! Chrysler took car of all expenses, gave us an 2010 T&C drive while being repaired and could not explain how this would happen, the motor had oil so what the heck! The van rides nice, has plenty of room and has great featues like power door & liftgate and DVD and navigation. "
chrysler,town-and-country,2007,Paul Fritz, 02/04/2007,Very nice and good value,4,"Nice ride if a little floaty but overall nice. Very nice dash and good night lighting.  Seats are comfortable and the Stow and Go is a dream.  I do not know the problem everyone has with power but there is enough here.  If I need more then I am in the wrong place doing something I should not. Engine is very smooth so I see no need for the DOHC.  Overall, well worth the money. "
chrysler,town-and-country,2007,Dave, 03/22/2007,Great Van,4,"This is our 2nd Town and Country. Loved the first and hope this one is as good as that one was. Like driving it. Miss the hand grips above. Stow and go is really a great feature, but you give up comfort in the back seats. Mileage on old van was 18 around town. Don't expect to do much better with this or any other van. No trips required back to the dealer for quality issues.. amazing."
chrysler,town-and-country,2007,kuppusamy, 05/24/2007,Great for my kiddos!,4,"I traded in my Lexus RX300 for a minivan. This has all the features I had plus more (DVD and auto doors/trunk). I love that the doors open so I don't have to fool with my 14 month old, diaper bag, infant (w/carrier), and shopping bags. It's not as lush as the Lexus, but it gets the job done. It's loaded, but still not comparable. I wish there was a higher end model that felt like a luxury SUV inside."

chrysler,town-and-country,2007,Jerome, 02/12/2010,No more chrysler's,2,With less than 35000 mi the air conditioning was repaired four times.The tie rods and bushings were replaced twice.The second time parts were back ordered.I guess everybody was having tie rods replaced.At 64000 the front end rattles again but parts are no longer covered by warranty.I also had to have power steering fluid flused and changed to hopefully silence a noise that has been there since new.Sounds like the power steering pump may be next.I am surprised customer safety isn't important enough for Chrysler to recall steering related parts.Chryler also refused to pay for tires worn out by faulty tie rod ends and bad bushings.Overall this vehicle has soured my taste for chrysler products.
chrysler,town-and-country,2007,odgers, 07/15/2010,Not happy,3,"Chrysler Town and Country Touring. Top of the line. It has been nothing but problems. The Dealership I bought the car from changed from Chrysler to Nissan, Wonder why? So now I have to drive further away to get car serviced, which cost me more money in gas and miles on my car. etc,  My dad was a mechanic, my brother in law is a mechanic, so it not like I do not know cars. All kinds of problems with squeaks, screeches of brakes it is horrible, I am embarrassed when I pull up next to someone. Just horrible. I went to have them checked they tell me not making that sound now, cant fix, its the brake pad has metallic metal or something my god its a $36,000.00 vehicle."

Oh and they use thin rotors on the vehicle so be ready to change them every 10-15K miles."

This vehicle is been at the dealer multiple times for many problems, brakes, battery, AC, noises, vibrations, transmission, axles,and more. The service experience is been horrible. last time they had to replace the transmission torque converter for shifting problems and the service adviser said that the problem with a defective shaft was caused by not rotating the tires, what? They think people don't know how to search for information these days. "
chrysler,town-and-country,2007,ArkansasTraveler, 09/22/2008,Satisfied Customer,3,"I have owned a Touring for 15 months and no problems. Recently,the passenger side airbag light came on after I gave a ride to a 250 pound friend, my wife is 120 pounds. I think that was because of  the Occupant Classification System.  Good gas mileage on highway but very disappointing in town.  I am very happy with the van's features, but the trip computer is a bit complicated--particularly to check out while on the road. I just moved my daughter into her college duplex.  We had her things in storage over the summer, and I moved her things to the duplex.  I thought it would take 5 or 6 trips, but we did it in two, an amazing amount of storage with the 2nd and 3rd row seats down."
chrysler,town-and-country,2007,Ann, 11/15/2008,Never again,2,"This is my second Chrysler. I have a child in a wheelchair and this vehicle was the best as far as space available inside for chair and passengers. The first was bottom line and cheaper than other brand minivans. It gave me nothing but problems. The second time around I decided to get top of line, Chrysler Town and Country Touring, maxed out. Bad choice. It wasn't any better. Air conditioner poblems from leaking inside to blowing all kinds of ways, the shocks are horrible they actually squeek with every little bump. I went to have them replaced but are on back order. The ride is so rough. Gas mileage is horrible. Short in outlets and many others. This will be my last Chrysler and Dodge!"

chrysler,town-and-country,2007,charles, 11/19/2008,A real Find,5,"We needed a second vehicle and decided on a mini van. After searching internet sources we settle on an 07 T&C with 15,000 miles. The day we went to see it a last minute check turned up the same model with only 5,000 on it. I was skeptical to say the least. It turned out to be a Chrysler exec car with 5,000 miles and still had the new car showroom smell. You can't fake that. We love it. Our other car is a Caddy Deville and while our van is not a Caddy, it is equally comfortable on long trips. The gas mileage with under 10,000 on it now is better than the Caddy.I am getting 20-22 mph in town and upwards of 25 on the highway. I can only wait until the mileage gets up there and better MPG."
chrysler,town-and-country,2007,Raycuda, 02/14/2009,Our First Minivan,4,"We lease this Signature Series Touring T&C. My wife is the primary driver and she loves it. This vehicle replaced a 2004 Pacifica, which I loved. After 30,000 miles, the only maintenance other than oil changes has been front brake pads. Visibility is much better than the Pacifica. We have the navigation system, the DVD system, the satellite radio, leather interior, and sun roof. Lease ends in May and my wife likes this van so much, she wants to buy it rather than get a new one. Vehicle is comfortable to drive and ride in, the carrying capacity is unbelievable, and as much as I hate to admit, it is very good family vehicle (I never thought we would own a minivan). My only complaint gas mileage"

Also, tie-rods replaced at 27,000 miles! Service adviser said probably because the tie- rods were made for cars and couldn't take the weight of the van. I've worked on cars myself and have NEVER seen a tie-rod go at 27,000 miles! Check the internet, I'm not the only one.I know foreign makes have there problems also,but,I'm really disappointed in a $32,000 vehicle. "

All brakes needed to be completely replaced and the a/c has cost $2,000 so far and even with another $1000 they don't think they can get it fixed.  Now the cooling fans for the motor won't work.  We love Stow and go, but will give it up not to have these kinds of problems again.  Beware!"

Van is comfortable and we love the power sliding doors and rear liftgate. We've been able to haul several large items that would have never fit in a car. Still too early to tell about gas mileage. Would definitely buy another Chrysler minivan."
chrysler,town-and-country,2007,DollarRental, 09/03/2007,Kept an Open Mind but Disappointed,3,"As much as I tried to like this minivan, I just can't and here's why. Buzzy engine when downshifting to pass other cars at freeway speeds.  Scared my wife more than once when downshifting. Steering wheel controls at the back of the steering wheel? Not very intuitive. Very soft suspension.  Not inspiring a lot of confidence while driving around the mountains of Denver, CO.  Not even full leather seating surfaces or if it is, I can't tell.  The main seat was leather but the side edges on the seat top felt suspiciously like vinyl.  Yes, having legacy worker benefits to support does take away from the competitiveness of this minivan compared to others."
chrysler,town-and-country,2007,John, 09/13/2007,It could be Better,2,"With all the accolades surrounding the Chrysler mini-van, I expect a good vehicle. Instead, this vehicle seems to be a work in progress. The cruise control couldn't control the speed. The radio was weak in picking up stations. The overhead controls for fuel mileage, etc, were confusing"

We also have a 2003 T&C that has been problem-free. Looked at others but there's no way they have the comfort, reliablity and features the T&C has. The leather stow n go seats are quite a bit more comfortable than those in a 2005 touring version I have ridden in - not bad at all. We will be looking forward to not removing seats every time we want to haul something or take our dogs for an extended drive.  The quality of the leather on T&C's seats is also a cut above other vans and it's a quieter minivan than others. It's a good value for us."

Not fun to drive cause you are never sure if or when something in the front end is going to fall off or break.  Excessive wind and road noise. Can't wait to trade it off for a modern vehicle"

The Stow and Go seating is great, but you give up seat comfort for this feature. Our old van seats where much softer and more comfortable.  People are knocking power, but I just drove this 2000 miles on vacation at 80 MPH and never once did I feel underpowered!  My family loves this car and with good maintenance fully expect it to last 10 years. Without a car payment for 5 of those years I will pay my kids college tuition."

It handles horribly, it feels like the steering wheel goes side to side when driving. It veers the right, the dealership told me it was the tire pressure (not) its not fuel efficient. The seat belts on 2nd row seating make it hard for people to get to the 3rd row seating. Probably because its a bench seat, but that was bad engineering on Chryslers part. The side view mirrors are manual. Hello this is the millennium. So is the clock, you have to put a pen in the clock to change the time. Again, I was rushed, wish I would've taken my time. I wouldn't buy it again. Oh yeah the 2nd row seats sit so close the front row! No space for my kids!"

chrysler,town-and-country,2007,Patrick , 06/06/2020,Could not believe I actually loved owning a miniva,5,"I bought a used 2007 touring edition model with leather and stow and go seating with 103k miles and a salvage title for $3000 and it was in almost mint condition. One of the best used purchases besides the pontiac vibe I ever made. I needed more cargo room for my 3 dogs (my big guy is a Presa Canario 120lbs). I bought a home in Jacksonville FL and I was commuting back and forth from SC every week for 6 months on my 3 day weekends off with my dogs to remodel my new home while moving a few things at a time with me. I also had a class 3 hitch on the back which worked perfect for light towing. I put 30k miles on this minivan in 6 months and it was super reliable. I changed the front brakes and rotors and put tires on it. It probably was due for a tune up with new plugs and cables but I just mentioned that to the new owner. I sold it once I moved to FL since I wanted something more flashy and I no longer needed to commute with my dogs. I sold it for the price I paid for it 30k later. 
I never thought I would ever own a minivan but the cargo room was insane with stow and go seating, the AC worked excellent in the summer months traveling with my dogs, leather was easy to clean and just put a painter's blanket down all in the back for dog hair control, worked out well. 
I do like the new body style better and thought about buying another one, but really also want 4wd so may end up buying a Montero with the larger body style and cargo room.
You cant beat this minivan for cargo space, like a living room on wheels with seats folded flat into the floor. I loved push button sliding doors on both sides and push button rear hatch. All doors also worked from my key remote. For $3k this was an excellent deal and worked perfectly for my needs. The ride was very comfortable, gas mpg was way better than I would have expected, and cargo space cant be beat. "

chrysler,town-and-country,2008,airsense00, 07/08/2014,Be Careful With Used Purchase,3,"We like the features of the van such as powered doors, captain seats, DVD players. The kids love the van and it is safe. However I greatly question the quality and reliability. With 70,000 miles on ours it literally eats 1 quart of oil per 1000 miles. No blue smoke, not leaking on floor. The first week we owned it the EGR valve went bad. The brakes are new so haven't replaced them yet in 6 months. Seems to wear the tires pretty quick. Sounds like a wheel bearing is going bad lately. The interior has some cheap spots as the handle for the gear shift fell off as did the sun visor. The gas mileage is averaging 18 mpg which is mix of town and highway. Buy the extended warranty for this one! The transmission started very occasionally not shifting in to 2nd gear so I traded it in.
"
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,msecrest, 06/28/2011,Regretting buying this vehicle,3,"I purchased this vehicle in 2009 as a second owner with 33,000 miles on it.
 Since then I have put ~50,000 miles on it.

The van is comfortable and rides decent.
It has plenty of storage space.
Gas mileage is lower than I'd like at 19/23.

Mechanically this vehicle has had nothing but issues.
 While some were recalled and fixed, others are not.

Problems:
1 - it uses oil, about 1qt/1000 miles.
This is a major issue with me.
2 - The sliding door hinges do not support the doors well.
They start rubbing on the bottom guide.
3 - I've had it in for service on the engine 3 times.
Currently in the shop with issues.

For a top of the line minivan I expected the quality to be a lot higher."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Jessew, 10/13/2015,"Rear axle Brace keeps snapping at speed,",3,"We bought this vehicle New,and now have 115K on it .The engine and transmission have been excellent,everything else seems cheaply built and falling apart..The most serious issue is that the rear axle brace that fastens the passenger side rear wheel to the body of the vehicle has snapped cleanly in two twice in the past 6 months,no idea why .The last time we were at 45 MPH,fishtailing all over the road, fortunate to bring it to a safe stop....and 600 miles from home..We were lucky to find a little local welding shop there , they added an angle iron to the tinsy little brace,welded it on and we returned home safely.....Chrysler designed a cutout hole into the brace ,probably to save a few pounds of metal ,that is where both breaks happened about 3 inches apart....we feel lucky to be alive.

chrysler,town-and-country,2008,khadra, 09/14/2013,Lets be realistic,4,"This is our second 2008 town and country, both were preowned. Th first was LX trim and the current one is limited. I got the first minivan with 95 k and I sold it with 130k and 4 years of ownership. It was running solid but did not have a lot of options that we needed. Then two months ago I was able to spot a black 2008 tc limited. You can't beat the value of these minivans; the price of the minivan, oem parts and dealership labor and still under 17 K. Lets be realistic, maybe this minivan is not durable like a toyota, BUT you get huge savings and lot of features that you can't find with other manufacturers. It's not expensive to maintain the minivan and I believe reliable enough. "
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Angela, 07/18/2015,BUYER BEWARE!! DON'T BUY!!!,2,"Run away as fast as you can from the 2008 Chrysler Town & Country Touring minivan.  We purchased this vehicle pre-owned in July of 2013 and we are currently in the month of July 2015.  Since we have owned the vehicle, we have had to change the front brakes 3 times and the rear brakes once, as well as, the rotars for the front braking system.  We use a 5w-20 Synthetic Blend oil and we are always needing to add at least 2 quarts before the next oil change. The minivan only has approximately 77,7xx miles. Which is still relatively low as far as mileage is concerned on a vehicle.  I called the dealership and I was informed that this is a common problem for the 2008 Chrysler minivan.  For some reason after it reaches 50K miles, the vehicle is designed to burn more oil; per Technician.  (What a funny man, right?) Anyways, since March of 2015 to July 17, 2015, our back rear top brake light bar stopped working and it caused our check engine light to trigger.  Of course, according to 2 major, well-known auto parts store that it is a Dealship repair. I was given the estimate of $200-$400 for a replacement part. Next the top radiator hose blew a nice, quarter size hole to the plastic connector piece. We weren't able to replace that piece, because it required the entire assembly to be replaced, which was very close to a $500 repair. I can not forget to mention all the squeaky noises the vehicle has during the winter months. Such as the dvd compartment area rattles and squeaks, something on the the passenger row door squeaks (similar noise to a torn cv boot). The plastic bracket that holds the sunvisor in place, has fallen out, because the screw appears to be stripped. The A/C blower fan was operating loudly. Once again, was informed it was a common problem for this type of vehicle and a $250 repair cost. The day before family vacation in May 2015, the cable for the passenger row door snapped. That was quoted at approximately $700 for THAT repair. Then today, as I was doing errands, the check engine light came on. I had a diagnostic test performed and now I have 2 more issues. 1) The ECM has detected that brake switch 2 is applied while brake switch 1 is open. 2) EGR position sensor rationality closed. Meaning The ECM is detecting EGR flow or movement when it is not expected. Probable cause: Failed EGR Solenoid, Failed EGR position sensor, & Failed EGR valve. Yes, another expensive repair. Estimate is between $200-$400 and we also have 2 separate recall notices, which neither have been repaired. The dealership doesn't know when the parts from the factory will become available and it could take anywhere from 3-5 years before the repairs take place. Unfortunately, this is absolutely the worst vehicle we have ever owned!!!  A disheartening factor is I was a previous owner of a brand new 2001 Chrysler Sebring. It was the best vehicle with very few problems. When we decided to purchase the Chrysler minivan, I was elated. I was certain we had made a great choice based on my previous experience. I was so wrong on so many levels.  Sad to say, but with relief, we will no longer purchase another Chrysler!!  I'm looking forward to a much better, less stressful experience  that will not become a money pit witin 2 years.

chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Austin, 08/24/2015,Death Trap,1,"We had a 2008 Town & Country had every option to it. Including Swivel n'Go, and Walter P Chrysler Package. Well Our journey with it was OK. But it started to have issues I mean a lot of issues. Down to the point of it having a poorly made suspension. My families almost death experience was because of Chryslers poor engineering team. The story of this start in March of 2013 when my family and I were on our way to Myrtle Beach, SC for Spring Break. They trip was going fine for the first four hours of our trip but once we got around the Louisville, Kentucky area; we got a really bad shaking in our suspension so we pulled off at the nearest rest area. We checked all the tires to find that they looked perfectly normal and had no bulges in them. So we proceed to drive down the Interstate going about 75 MPH and all of a sudden it felt like the rear axle had fallen off the vehicle. The van goes immediately into a fish tale and luckily didn't flip over because at one point we were completely sideways going down the interstate. After the Van had come to a stop my family completely in utter disbelief get out of the van to find that our wheel had sheered off the wheel hub assembly. After a tow truck was called and the van was taken to the Chrysler dealership we found out that it was caused by a manufacture defect that wasn't able to take the load of six people and luggage; that the stress on the axle was to great. We no longer have this van and no longer feel safe inside a Chrysler product. We now own a 2013 Ford Flex SEL and it has taken us a lot more places with a bigger load with no issues. Anybody reading this review DON'T BUY THIS VAN Especially if you have kids. I recommend looking at the Ford Flex best car we have owned. Learn from our Mistake and don't buy the van. We are lucky to be alive.

Very few problems have occurred and it has consistently given 25 mpg on trips and exceptional comfort. Passengers have enjoyed the heated seats and three area a/c and heating controls. The sound system is great and the gps system works perfectly. We hope it goes to a new owner who likes it as much as we do.

chrysler,town-and-country,2008,snoore, 11/26/2010,Jury is still out,4,"Overall this is an excellent buy for the amount of money you pay.  I think the leather seems very soft and that may be a problem with kids and that is the only reason I gave a score of 8 on interior. Similarly I think it should hold up but the exterior could have used better quality plastics. Overall performance on 4.0 engine, fun factor, the electronics on board are great, considering this is a mini-van. The doors were acting up but dealer is not trained well or they do not have a good problem database.  My friend who has the same van showed me how to fix the problem by tightening a hex screw on each door - DONE.  Need wider set of tires and need the spare tire in a better place - come on!"

The VES system with the van is great, when it is not freaking out and deciding if it  this will be the day it quits completely.

Rotors every other year. It has gone through two sets of new tires. It has numerous very serious recalls. Two new sets of front wheel bearings. The most recent major fix was this winter at 80,000 miles the head gaskets needed to be redone. Now the front struts are completely shot. This vehicle only has 90,000 miles on it. Too say this vehicle has been nothing but a stress would be an understatement. It has since purchase spent on average every 3 to 4 months in the shop for major fixes of one sort or another. Now struts. What are the odds if I just hold out these too will be recalled? argh!!!!!! A warning to anyone considering buying this vehicle used, do not Purchase. The only reason I have not sold or traded this vehicle in is I refuse to pass this lemon on and void the Lifetime Powertrain Warranty. Chrysler is gonna honor that for life and I'm not gonna let them off the hook for putting out such a piece of crap product by selling this POS to some poor unassuming sap who doesn't know better. :( :( Never will I buy another chrysler product and I have been a faithful chrysler owner for over 20 years.

chrysler,town-and-country,2008,psh5, 09/03/2011,Do not buy,3,"As mentioned by another reviewer, I have had to replace the rear breaks twice with only 43,000 on the vehicle.
Many electrical problems.
Currently has an electrical issue that is messing with the starter, but the part is on back order, so I will just have to hope it keeps running until the part comes in.
The button you push to change gears has broken twice.
This is considered cosmetic under the extended warranty plan, and therefore is no longer covered.
Front headlight cost $300 and four hours to repair."

Electrical would cut out until igition replaced (ran, but no wipers, turn signals, etc) and worked fine for a while.
New problem:
just shuts off while driving.
Twice so far.
As in NOTHING worked, including the steering.
Yes, you read that correctly.
Driving down the road then the thing shut off and there was NO STEERING.
I have also had the problem with the sliding doors opening after they seem to be shut, but you can only shut them if the car is in park.
Poor design feature to say the least.

After purchasing it we put new yokahama tires H rated for that little extra security, all four brakes ,brake hoses , replaced plugs flushed coolant changed all wiper blades fixed the typical heater hose issue behind the exhaust manifold replaced the rear blower motor and changed the air filter as well as run nothing but Mobil 1 5w 20... I did this trying to start off with the van somewhat reliable so far I notice slight oil usage but considering the miles I'm not complaining it could be seeping from the rear main seal but not enough to make spots on the driveway. I bought an egr valve bc I heard that's a common failure but over all I think if you do good maintenance and replace parts as needed these vans can be great machines for a family. They are roolol affordable and just handy. We plan on dropping another engine and/or transmission in it and keep running it for a long time. Age doesn't bother me its more about maintenance and although the transmission does shift a bit goofy but seems to do everything its supposed to lol

Even Worse it's like pulling teeth to get the dealer to fix it. Consumer Reports gave it the worst rating with all black dots, and they where right. Never buy Chrysler.

We have been resisting the minivan market, but the Family Room on Wheels commercial made us test drive the T&C.  We ended up buying it and absolutely love it.  The toddlers are disappointed when they have to ride with me in my Tahoe.  The ride is great, it rides like a car with minimal interior noise and an overall smooth ride.  The seats are comfortable and the features are endless.  We have the dark blue with cream interior which looks great and the amount of chrome outside really makes the colors pop.  Here goes...I love my minivan!"

The only warranty problems I had were with the side mirrors, the side marker covers fell off and one mirror wouldnÂt return after backing up, the dealer replaced one mirror and fixed the marker on the other. Chrysler had a recall on the front brakes at 18000 miles; the dealer replaced the entire front brake components. Other than those minor things it has been trouble free and dependable. I do make sure the regular maintenance is done on time, including a transmission oil change at 60000 mi. I drive to OK city regularly, a 16hr trip, it is a pleasure to drive and 25 mpg doesnÂt hurt either. I would buy another in a second.

chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Linda Velazquez, 04/17/2017,Deceptive transmission warranty,2,"I bought the 2008 Chrysler Town and Country van because they told me they would warrant the transmission for as long as I owned the car.   I had previously owned a 1995 Town and Country van and the transmission went out at 90,000 miles.   They assured me that Chrysler had fixed the transmission and wanted to restore their reputation by warranting it for the life of the car.   They told me I would never spend another dime on transmission repairs.   So I bought the car.   At 45,000 miles the dealer told me the transmission cooler lines were leaking and wanted $490 to repair it.   Chrysler refused to cover this citing the fine print in my owners manual which doesn't include this part.   I asked the Chrysler headquarters how often this line starts leaking at 45,000 miles and they said they never heard of it.   And this was one of the $3000 in repairs needed to this van at $45,000 miles.   Needless to say, I will NEVER buy another Chrysler.   And you shouldn't either.   They do not hold up very well.   And their sales are very deceptive.   I actually believed them and I feel ripped off.

With over 221,000 miles.",5,"I was driving my 1985 Plymouth Voyager in September 2018 when I spotted this minivan with a “For Sale” sign in the window. I had longed for this body style for many years. I contacted the owner and purchased it with the miles shown above. I have owned many Chrysler products in the past, but driving this van is like stepping into the future! 
I purchased this van specifically because of the 3.8L V6 overhead valve, pushrod engine. It is ‘old school’ built like engines in the past, simple to maintain. Even with all these miles and being a 3rd owner, the engine burns no oil, the 6 speed transaxle works smoothly and the van overall is silent on the road. I cannot even hear the engine, it is so well insulated. Yes, I have only driven it a little over 5,000 miles but I find it to be a great ‘over the road’ vehicle. 
I have to wonder what those folks who had breakage problems at so low miles on their vans were doing. This van had been in commercial service by the previous owner and nothing was broken. Well, nothing but the windshield with chips and cracks from much highway useage. First thing to be replaced along with brake pads from normal wear.
To those of you who are still driving your 2008 and newer Town and Country van, you should have many years of dependable service ahead. I expect it from mine.

We drive this van everywhere and its been 100% reliable and we've had no issues whatsoever. Great van that I love to drive and the kids thoroughly enjoy being in on trips!!! 
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Heidi, 06/22/2009,Upset with my van,2,"I am very upset with my mini van.  I fell lke I have had my van in the shop every other month.  With having to replace all 4 brakes.  Needing it in shop to have computer recalibrated.  Sliding doors not working and needing adjusted, and now burning oil!!!!  I also just was called because of another recall.  Can anything else happen.  I tried to trade in but I owe more then they are selling on the lots!!!! Just wander what else can happen to it!!"
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,John boy, 08/10/2009,"So far, so good",4,"Purchased our Limited with 18k, now has 26k. We've had a few minor problems with the power sliding doors (one door sometimes does not open in extreme cold, the other needed an adjustment, both were oversensitive in the operation - software fix) and with the radio/nav unit (restarting the ignition fixed it). Otherwise, it's been trouble-free. Very cushy. Front seats could use more shoulder/neck support and adjustable headrests. 3rd row lacks legroom, but then, it's designed for kids. Poor HVAC control design. MPG is around 15 city, and we've gotten as much as 31 highway @65-70 mph. If you're in the market and can afford it, get the Ltd. The 3.3 and 3.8 have no real power; the 4.0 does."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,gmike, 10/12/2009,Stay Away!!!,1,"We leased a 2008 Town & Country and have had nothing but problems.  Three days into the lease brakes made noise and stearing was off. We hadd to get new brakes, roters and a wheel alignment.  Doors were opening on thier own or not closing.  Drove to Florida, the radiator cap blew and radio would not work for 3 hours, radio stations change on thier own.  The van is horrible and we are fighting to get out of the lease, the dealership was horrible, they are located in Jersey, they could care less that we had all the problems, they gave me a PT cruiser as a rental and made me change cars outside in a snow storm with a 3 year old and a 7 month old, no help and would not let me in the garage!!!"
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,AGN, 11/19/2009,Problems Problems Problems,2,I have had this vehicle for a little over 21 months.  All I can say is thank goodness for the warranty.  I have had the following problems:  Feb-Oct 2008-system computer was out of whack...electrical system in general to malfunction sporatically.  I was sent a disc in October that fixed this problem.  March 2009-Air conditioning quit cooling.  Fixed under warranty  July 2009-New brakes and rotors at my expense  September 2009-New tires necessary due to excessive wear September 2009-Wheel Bearings needed to be replaced on front of van.  November 2009-Oil light came on.  Crank sshaft and other problems.  Needed a new engine.
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,POdatChrysler, 03/09/2010,Last Chrysler ever,2,"I really, really fought with myself over the purchase of this vehicle. Even before we purchased it, the MV was getting terrible reviews. But there was the issue of the warranty. The incredible lifetime warranty that no one else offered. I gotta say, they reeled me in - hook, line, sinker.  You know that 3 year 36,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty thing? Somehow or another the wheels and brakes must sit outside of the bumpers, cause my brakes went bad with only 27,000 miles on them. 20,000 of those miles were all highway. Repair to replace? $479 at Midas on a 17 month old car.  Think about that."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,bathomson, 03/19/2010,"Bad, bad, bad brakes!",4,"Two sets of front disc and rotors in 26,000 mostly highway miles (6 cross- usa trips)!   Dealership acknowledges problems with brakes but states normal wear & tear?   Check engine light has been on for 1000's of miles and they can't figure it out?  Great van otherwise!"
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Satisfied Customer, 05/02/2010,2008 Chrysler Town and Country Limited 4,4,"Purchased used with 18000 miles on odometer. I currently have 30,000 miles and have not experienced and problems. Very satisfied with my minivan. My eight year old and her friends love all of the kid friendly features, especially the satellite TV. Great vehicle for our lone drive auto vacation to Myrtle Beach, and perfect for my long weekend golf trips with three buddies. Love the navigation that give much more information than how to get from point A to B. Really comes in handy when on golf trips in unfamiliar locations and trying to find restaurants, movies, etc.   So far so good.  Thing negative to report.The best appointed mini van I have seen. Surprised by the many negative reviews."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Unsatisfied Customer, 05/21/2010,Town & Country Unreliable and Dangerous,1,"My 2008 T&C (only 20k miles!) has had numerous transmission problems (wont shift out of first gear, loud clunking noises, etc.).  The latest issue is a loss of acceleration at highway speeds.  The check engine light will come on and the car rapidly loses speed.  Chrysler cant fix the problem because they cant reproduce it during test drives, even though the vehicles monitoring system returns several error codes. The dealer and manufacturer dont want to throw parts at the problem and are unable to do anything else to fix it.  Efforts to resolve this issue through Chrysler's Impartial Service Group have been ineffective."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,ccc, 06/20/2010,Do not buy this van!,1,"Problems, problems and more problems. Read the reviews. We had all the same expensive problems plus more. First month satellite radio and ves system needed replaced. The computer needed reset doors weren't working properly. Brakes, rotors, needed replaced, air conditioning broke needed fixed. Not to mention the hours of driving back and forth 40 min to dealer to have things checked and then fixed. All the rental car fees I had to pay and the pure inconvenience. I don't think I have spoken to anyone who has not had the same problems. Do yourself a favor and do not buy this van."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,BCarr, 08/07/2010,Great Entertainment Package.,3,"We have had 4 Chrysler/ Dodge mini vans (Ford, GMC also).  The overall comfort and driving on the Town and Country was very good.  The DVD/ TV/ Sirius etc is great but the van is not dependable, poor finish and too many noises that aren't supposed to be there.  I am glad we bought the extended warranty!  So far in two years we have replaced the gas tank (technician talk, sometimes things just break, can't really say why!), front rear brakes and front rotors, front bearings, replaced compartments to store headphones,adjusted sliding doors, radio/hard-drive, MP3 (that wasn't too bad, got an extra 6 mos subscription to Sirius!). Not worth the $38,000 we spent, will never buy new Chrysler again."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Upset Customer, 08/26/2010,Will never buy Chrysler again!,1,"I wrote a review earlier on this purchase, 4 months after I purchased it. I feel the need to write another. Total problems=4 times to dealership for door alignment, they sprung my door in the process, motor on fan blown, front brakes replaced at 36,000 miles, transmission slips a lot, now front and rear brakes need to be replaced at 56,000 miles, front wheel bearings are shot and cant get any replacements, as of yesterday there are 4000 on back order through Chrysler and there are no after-market parts for this. It is a safety issue and Chrysler doesn't care. When my tires fall off going down the highway, Chrysler will care about the lawsuit they will have to deal with!"
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,K Smith, 08/27/2010,Warning! Loads of problems.,2,"Had brake work done early - like the others.  Have had this work done under warranty so far: replaced radiator cap with faulty seal when overheating, refill freon & replace faulty hose when a/c quit, transmission software upgrades (3x's) because it clunks in/out of gear.  Now has been in the service shop over 2 weeks for ""Major engine problem"" and failing wheel bearings.  Also have had some minor electrical problems.  Problems with door sliding (or not) open/close, that I forgot I need to tell the service guy until I read these reviews.  Sure wish I'd read these 2 years ago, I'd be in a different vehicle.  "

Worse mistake I made in my life!  At 300 miles transmission was slipping bad. Warranty replaced after about 18 times to shop! Brakes and Rotors have been replaced, gear shift has fallen off, lights go off when they want to.  Doors lock 15 mins after take off and then today I find out I need to struts and shocks. Please save your money you will regret buying this vehicle. Never heard of a new car needing so much attention.  My 96 has only needed minor maintenance! Oh and let me not forget that the a/c doesn't cool properly and always some type of recall! People run like hell!      "
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,john, 10/30/2010,Chrysler should have gone broke,1,"Building vehicle like this they should be out of business. Breaks and tires had to be replaced b4 25,000 miles. The vehicle constantly squeaks and has more interior rattles than a babies toy. The shifter broke off at 18,000, and the air conditioner had a leak at 22,000 and the fuel mileage has never been close to advertised (average of 16.9) and dealership response is lacking at best. One constant problem has been break noise. It has been to several dealerships while under warranty (more than eight times) and they can't fix the problem. They keep calling it dust on the brakws, all I know is it's embarrassing to drive."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,eudaxmn, 04/17/2008,T & C the best keeps getting better,4,"I have owned several cars and minivans over the years. My wife's previous vehicle was a 01 T&C with 139K miles which we traded for this new T&C. I am a life long Corvette owner. Let me tell you, I argue with my wife daily in letting me drive this vehicle. Chrysler invented the Minivan, they have to made it so much better. I love to be seen in this vehicle, everywhere I stop people ask me about the vehicle. I just reply ""it is like being in your family room with the added feature of movement"". To date I have not seen a crossover that can compete with this vehicle. The days of a minivan not being a ""cool"" vehicle are over. This is by far the ""COOLEST"" vehicle on four wheels for the Family.."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,luvinga4, 05/17/2008,LOVE this van!,5,"Ok, so we did just pick this up tonight from the dealership, but I'm in love! We were die-hard import drivers up until now.  But seeing how we were hit in a major front end collision last week that totaled our Nissan Quest, we had to find another van quickly with our family of 5 plus pets.   So I did my research, asked around when I'd see a T&C driver in a parking lot-and got very positive reviews.  We got our Touring edition for the same cost as a stripped down Toyota or Honda!!   We've been driving around all night in our new van.  The kids LOVE the swivel and go seats & the dual dvd screens! For once they have begged to get in the van! LOL"
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,LOVE and FEAR, 05/18/2008,Liftgate problems,4,Have not made my first payment yet and it is in the shop for 5 days for a brake issue and when opening my power lift gate I tried to close it and the van thought it was already closed.  I had to drive with my lift gate not closed to the closet dealer.  I have only heard rave reviews on this new van and the creature comfort won me over.  I hope I made the right decision.
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,NormB, 05/22/2008,T&C touring eition,4,"Just completed a 1500 mile trip in our 2008 T&C touring edition. This is a well thought out vehicle, with lots of nifty features- mygig, heated power seats, etc. The van handled very well on the (mostly freeway) trip. Good power from the 3.8 V6. The braking is very good. I averaged almost 25 MPG, which is better than I expected to get. That should improve a bit as it gets fully broken in. I think the 6 speed transmission helped with the high ""overdrive"" gearing.  Here's a tip - my Chrysler dealer offered bumper to bumper lifetime warranty for around $2,000. A quick internet search found other Chrysler dealers selling the same thing for $1500 or so."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,jhnep2117, 05/28/2018,10 years of no breakdowns.,5,"I bought this car new. It has given me 10 years of trouble free driving. It got a  new battery and rear brakes. Everything else came from the factory, including the tires that are still on it. Granted it only has 35,925 miles, it still has 10 years of wear. The only problems I had was from all the recalls. Never buy the first year of a model change. I had a '87 Voyager SE, '97 Grand Caravan SE,'08 Town + Country LX. Every van got better. Less mechanical problems and more creature comforts. At the present I have a '18 Pacifica Touring Plus. I hope it is as good or better than my Town + Country was.

chrysler,town-and-country,2008,PJB, 05/17/2010,The plus's and minus's of the 2008 T&C,3,"Now 65K. By and large we like this vehicle due to its design, great versatility, its strong performance, and many nice features.  I was disgusted to have to change brakes and rotors at 17K then pads again 6 months later.  Scary when the computer went AWOL 4 times  Suddenly the lights were flashing, the horn was honking and the windshield wash squirting then the doors opened and closed, then locked us out.  I am worried for the future because the transmission clunks when it shifts into 2nd under no load or if you try to accelerate just as you come to a stop.  I will likely not buy another Chrysler because the company and its dealers just don't stand behind their products, they make excuses"
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,DougW, 09/25/2007,The Mercedes of Minivans,5,"Whats an amazing change from the old shape to this new shape, everything is different. I like the little touches that really make this car feel like a high end European car vs the cheap plastic trip we have gotten used to in our domestic minivans. The first major improvement is the room for the driver and 2nd row passengers. I am 6'3"" (long torso) and i have zero problems driving this car or sitting in the 2nd row (swivel n go). We did test drive the stow n go 2nd row and the seat backs were just too low down for me, the top of headrest was below my shoulders so we had to go for the swivel n go anyway which are bucket heater leather seats just like the front (we have the 25L package)."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,CJ Tucker, 09/18/2010,Feeling Duped,2,"We traded in our 04 TC because we were having so many ""unexpected"" problems. Dealership even admitted that it must have been a ""Friday"" build. Now i wish we had kept the old one. We are under 30,000 miles, front and back brakes and rotors replaced, not at dealer, don't trust them, water pump replaced, radiator cap replaced. Now we are back in the shop because the electronic locks wont work, and there is a spot on the passenger side floor that is always wet. Plus the side doors are awful, always opening after you think they have been closed. Dealer admits that it was a bad design. So frustrated that i can't count on this vehicle. I have 4 little kids and thought i was paying for something reliable!"

The ac goes out, after repair, we find out this issue is on a recall list. Breaking has always been an issue, serious under breaking for vehicle weight. We have received a notice of 'break warranty extension', but we still have to pay for the break rotor and pads, $100. Chrysler has known about this cheep parts issue and won't man up and make a recall. Don't be afraid of a Toyota, we're not. "

chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Bread, 07/15/2010,Wish I never bought it!,2,My wife and I purchased the Town & Country Limited in September 2008.  We needed to replace the brake pads within 5months after purchase. We then replaced the brakes and rotors again 6months later.    Its electrical system has been giving us problems not starting for around 3 months The dealership can't seem to fix it.  My advice is to pay the extra money for the Honda Minivan.
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,scottw911, 06/03/2008,Awsome features in a less attractive Van,4,"This 2008 Limited is our 5th T&C since 1996. It is, by far, the best riding of the bunch.  The new 4.0L is MUCH better than the anemic 3.8 was.  The gas mileage, although not great, is the same as our 2005's, so I can live with that and the extra 50 hp or so.  The Bridgstone tires (on the 17"" wheels) are terribly soft sidewalled, so handling is sloppy. Replacements will have lower profile and stiffer walls. The interior is still the best available.  No swivel here.  We love the stow-and-go. MyGig and Nav are nice improvements too.  The light colored seats are just stupid! After 2 days, the driver's seat was dirty. Shifter placement takes getting used to. Overall: Better than previous year."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,peter, 06/09/2008,avoid this car,2,While this car may look nice outside inside it has cheap plastic look and there is barely enough room in third row for adults. But the main problem is its reliability. I've own it for 5 months and already had to be towed 2 times (electrical problem) and one time had radio removed and repaired. Since Chrysler doesn't have loaner cars you will be stuck getting rental car. Also this car only gets about 13 miles per gallon of gas which makes it very expensive to drive nowadays. 
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Rut & Kae, 06/11/2008,Love this mini van.,4,"We purchase this 08 Town&Country Limited after test driving the 08 Sienna XLE Limited and 08 Oddyssey Touring. This T&C is by far the best we've seen. We didn't like Oddysey's ""Tin can"" feel, road noise at highway speeds and the really dated dashboard. The Sienna was a good competitor but lacked swivel & go and SAT TV plus small cargo space and no gadgets. Instruments too looks dated. The T&C has a European feel to it. Turns out it is also the same as the VW Routan. The plush ride, beautiful interior, dual screen + satellite TV makes this van better than our Lincoln Navigator! Chrysler products was never in our radar screen before. This Minivan just blew us away."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Jeff, 06/23/2008,Beter MPG,3,"We enjoy the new model, many great features with swivel seats and enjoy the high tech goodies. We have been unimpressed with the 9mpg city driving. Our 2003 got 16 mpg city."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Sheri, 06/25/2008,What happened?,3,"We purchased this van so we would have a reliable and safe vehicle to drive back and forth to Chicago from South Carolina. Our first trip out, this lovely $40k vehicle lost all power and left us stranded in the Great Smokey Mtns. After being towed to the nearest dealer (70 miles away) we were informed that our engine was BLOWN. Yup - we made it exactly 2000 miles on one engine. Wow - is this a record? Needless to say, we are trying to get Chrysler to buy it back and perhaps get a Honda Odyssey? Maybe our van was just a fluke? Either way, being stranded with a 19 month old for 3 hours on the side of the road is not a good endorsement. Shame on you Chrysler. "
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,mainst94502, 06/28/2008,08 T&C Swivel & Go,4,We really enjoy the swivel & go.  It allows you to bring a restaurant on the road.  The vehicle is fun to drive.  We didn't get electric doors due to price incentives.  Wished that it came in a hybrid or diesel for better mileage. Really enjoy the instrumentation on the panel. Allows you monitor your driving and how it affects your mileage.

We ended up using a F&F discount and received a huge discount on the vehicle.  Not only do I feel like I got the best minivan on the market, I got it for the best price.  I love everything about the vehicle from the exterior style to the interior comfort features.  The dual dvd system, sat tv are the best thing one could ever find in a car to keep the little ones quiet.  I can now either drive in piece and quiet or listen to whatever I want and the kids can still be happy watching what they want with the headphones.  Great feature!"

Chrysler has done nothing to help. Will not return phone calls or letters. Finally after threating lawsuit or arbitration Chrysler finally agreed to work on the van under warranty. Van has 5500 miles on it. Van is 3 months old. Last Chrysler for me. Owned a 02-05-and 08 models all were new. Buy the Honda or Toyota or you will be sorry."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,pat s. slentz, 06/30/2008,Not ever again me and chrysler,2,Chrysler would not even call me. I had to threaten with a law suit or go to arbitration. Finally they called. My van from day 1 has a terrible air leak that comes through the dash I think that is so loud you cannot even hear the radio or talk on a cell phone. Sounds like a train whistle. The transmission is a joke. Gas mileage 20 on the highway with the Cruise on. So in ending if you have to have a van you better go to Honda or Toyota. I have owned 2 1995 Dodge vans and a 2005 and 2002 and this 2008 lemon. Hey Chrysler stick a fork in me I am done with your vehicles and no help at all from you. Y'all just do not care. Thats why your sales are slipping every month. Hope this is helpful .

Only concern is the MPG.  Last van did 16/17 mpg around town, now getting between 9 and 12 - HELP!  Hope this improves.  Went on 80 mile road trip to try to improve but the best was 14 mpg.  Had slight problem with dual DVD but dealership is replacing.  Overall love this vehicle, better bang for buck. Just hope MPG improve."

The sound system and the Sirius Sat radio and TV are wonderful.  My granddaughter always wants to ride with us.  Thanks Chrysler.   The only thing I see that might be improved quality wise is the shifter.  To me it seems not the quality the rest of the van is"

After several trips to the dealership to fix these issues they replaced the radio and recalibrated both doors.  We love the car since these issues have been corrected.  The bigger engine is KILLING us in gas.  We have the Limited 2008 Durango and a 2007 Corvette.  Who ever thought we would see the day where the Vette is by far the best gas mileage.

Much better gas-mileage than our 2001 LX with the 3.3 liter. Averaging anywhere from 24-27.9 MPG on the /HYWY. Computer's estimated mpg is off, however - anywhere from 0.7-4 mpg, reliable so far. Power doors are improved over previous models. I am 6'5"" and there is plenty of room for me. Love the stow-in-go seats. Can haul most anything. Just fold and forget! SAT radio is great as we live in a rural community. There are some cheep plastic parts but over-all quality is good. "

We have 4 kids ages 20, 16, 13, and 7 and a small dog. Going into this purchase we put a premium on comfort and utility. This purchase was mainly for road trips from Georgia to TX, AZ, and MD. The Honda drove the best and had high comfort but the driver seat was uncomfortable. The Toyota was impressive but expensive and the Flex to small.  We rated this van behind the Honda until pricing and entertainment. Chrysler T&C Touring was far better. We paid about 23,700 not including T&T. We put the van on the road to TX a day after buying and were impressed! We also got a lifetime power train warranty."

My advice is go to the dealership and hopefully you'll get a smart, knowledgeable, kind salesman as I did. i've had the car for 6 months, yes there have been a few minor problems, but I know that will happen with any new car, not knowing all about it. And with the Lifetime Warranty, I know I can run it until all the interior parts fall apart, which will be a while! I am a Chrysler fan for life!!"

At 3500 miles we heard a knock, lost all power and died. After being stranded with our 18month old on the side of the road it was towed to a dealership and we were told the engine was blown. After it was the for 2 weeks getting the small block repaired we drove it home to hear a knock again, our dealer here then had to replace the upper engine (rocker assembly) I have had nothing but a hard time from Chrysler over us being stranded out of state and having to then go back to Cali to get it. And another 4 days here to repair again. I had made one car payment on it and then had 3 weeks of rentals."

chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Entrpz, 07/23/2008,6 months Review,3,"I purchased my 2008 Town & Country back in Dec 2007, the van has not been too bad overall, but I took it in for the 10,000 KM service. The Transmission is leaking it leaded about 500 mi in my drive in just 4 days of sitting. The materials on the interior are of very low quality. The few times the radio has had not volume, had to shut off the car and restart to get it to work. Swivel seat are too heavier to be removed, but they are comfortable. Second and third Legroom is less on the 2008 models compared to the 2002. I do like the storage bins. There is a TSB about the radio and dead batteries. Navigation maps are too old, update in fall "
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,RSAB, 07/23/2008,First timer and liking it,4,This was the first minivan we've ever own and we really like it.  We test drove several minis and we felt that the TnC Signature series has the complete package (fun factor plus the lifetime bumper to bumper warranty).  We took the minivan on a trip the same week we bought it and the whole family enjoyed the drive all way down to the OBX.  Kids enjoyed the dual screen (one was watching DVD while the other was watching TV).  Our avg MPG for the trip was 25/gal (~1000 miles).  The van now has 1350 miles and still driving smooth.  The power doors and liftgate was awesome!
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Family of Boys, 07/31/2008,I love it!!,5,I didn't want a mini van.  I loved my Durango.  We needed something newer that would fit the family more comfortable.  After test driving the van I knew that we found something.  They didn't have the color I wanted to the dealership found me what I wanted.  I have been reading other reviews about things needing to be fixed and having a hard time getting them fixed.  We had a problem with the windshield not being sealed all the way.  We had no problem getting it fixed.  Maybe people should be a little bit more understanding that it is the first year of a new model.  There will always be problems that need to be fixed. If you treat the people with respect you will be treated better.
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Vanner, 08/04/2008,A Convert,4,"Having laughed at minivans for 20 years it was inevitable that I finally had to buy one now that the kids have arrived. Honda is the most fun to drive, Toyota the fastest and has AWD. But for utility and space the T&C is the best. And that's what minivans are for. We took it on a trip this week to Chicago with 2 adults and 4 kids. Lots of space and the satellite TV kept the kids happy. Power doors made entry and exit easy. Stow and Go is a marvel.  It is so practical. My other car is a Porsche 911 and the wife a Mercedes GL. We love the van as much if not more than the Germans."

chrysler,town-and-country,2008,dmo, 08/13/2008,Great van but lied on gas mileage,4,I absolutely love my new t&c. I had a 2006 300 which was a great car but basic in engine and style which didn't bother me but when I had my second kid I needed more room and this van did that and more. I also decided to get the touring limited package with dual dvd which my four yr old loves. my only issue is that it suppose to get 16 miles to gallon but we just got it filled a second time at 3.65 a gallon cost us 75 dollars and it only gets 10 miles to gallon! a little deceiving there but otherwise a great van!
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,MercMenace, 09/05/2008,Nice van,4,"Traded a 2002 Mercury Villager, and can only hope the Chrysler is as good a vehicle as the Villager proved to be.  Kids love all the video and multimedia bells and whistles.  Although the heated 2nd row seats were much anticipated, it appears the built-in boosters eliminate that feature with absolutely no disclosure by the window sticker, nor anywhere I can find in the manual.  Deplore the lack of automatic climate control in trim levels below Limited.  Air conditioning is extremely anemic compared to the Villager.  Extremely well-equipped and I have yet to discover every little bell and whistle.  Already wish I'd spent the extra $$ for the Limited, although I did get an amazing deal on it."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,milan green, 09/08/2008,a sad retiree,2,"Bought one. The day after buying my van, my wife and self made a 350 miles trip. We had a tire flat that could not be repaired. Being on Sunday all dealerships were closed. We found a retail store that sold the replacement tire, but was told that no tires were available(17"" wheel) from the factory. All available tires were used for the 2008 vans. We had to get a hotel room, to wait for a dealership to open(missing a day from work). The dealership was unable to get a new tire, but they found an old tire off a used vehicle. we were finally able to get home.  While returning from a second trip the multifunction switch controlling the wipers and high beams went out(the wipers could not be turn off)"
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,dmmjsm, 07/24/2012,Pass on this one,3,"We bought our van brand new. It was one of the few models of cars that would accommodate the wheelchair lift my husband needed. We are now at 37,000 and are needing brake work for the fourth time. We have had to replace the rotors twice under warranty, then once just a few months ago. I was driving the other day and the entire brake panel lit up. I have to take the darn thing back up again, and I shudder to think how much it will cost this time. I am angry that a car we depend on for my disabled husband has had so many brake problems."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Norm , 09/10/2008,Nice Family Vehicle and Fun to Drive,4,"I have owned Dodge Caravans before and had good success with them over the years.  Recently, we purchased a 2008 Town and Country Touring with the MyGig, SATTV, dual DVD screens and much more. This is a great family vehicle and very comfortable.  It truly is like sitting in your living room!! This car is significantly quieter than prior models.  Road noise is still there, but not bad.  The 3.8 liter is not going to win any races, but it has adequate power for Mom as well as for highway driving. Dash is very plush and controls are easy to use.  Headrests are dramatically improved over prior vans.  Altogether, I recommend this van.   "
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Bret Boyd, 12/21/2007,Switch from LandRover to Town & Country,5,"Great family vehicle. Kids love the Sirius TV, swivel seats. Dad loves the nav system, heated seats, ergonomics. Wife loves the kids & dad being happy. Tested Honda and looked at Toyota. It was no-brainer plus you have a lifetime warranty on powertrain."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Happy Driver, 10/12/2008,Nice van,4,"This van has been great for my wife and I, and also for our two girls. I chose this van over it's competitor (the Honda Odyssey) because of all the extra bells and whistles that it came with at a reasonable price. We still have not used all the options- ( like the hard drive and stuff)  but as for now everything seems to work great and its a nice smooth ride. It is also easy to get in and out for both us and our kids. The stow and go makes it so we can hall bigger thing we buy with out needing to take the truck all the time. We have enjoyed this van. It gives us a lot of information that we find useful as we are on our trips.(Tire psi, gas mileage, in and out Temp, GPS,and much more. :)     "
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,bnz320, 10/23/2008,Nice Minivan,4,"I have never been a fan of minivans, but with kids it has become a necessity. We didn't want a SUV because of gas mileage and this seemed like a nice alternative. We decided on the Touring Signature Series. We have had it about 3 months now and my wife loves it. It is very comfortable and still amazes me the amount of features this van has for the price. The seats are comfortable and riding in back is great. The drop down dvd players with cartoon channels makes it easy for kids to watch different things. Gas mileage is very reasonable for a vehicle this size, we are averaging about 20-21 mpg mixed use driving. "
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,John, 10/22/2008,Great minivan/great value-4.0/tow group/,4,"On a trip of about 160 miles of mostly highway driving at 65 mph, the computer reported 24.4 mpg with the 4.0 engine. The ride is quiet, seats are comfortable,and acceleration is impressive for the vehicle's size. Resetting the mpg meter to see what the vehicle will get around town, it appears to be between 17-18mpg. Now I only have about 1500 miles on the van, so I don't have a lot of data. The amount of electronic/electronic stuff is scary but if the vehicle is as reliable as my other 2 Chrysler vehicles ('01 300M & 96 Caravan) I'll be very happy. I'm not a dedicated Chrysler fan but I've picked them for their price/features/ and looks. But I still like the rounded looks of the 96 better."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,J.D., 10/29/2008,"Nice van, but it needs help",4,"I really like the looks and convenience features of the van.  It has a solid feel on the road and a good ride.  I am disappointed in the initial quality.  We have had several electrical issues; dashboard blackouts, radio failure, a ""clicking"" noise in the upper console above the second row seats.  28 days in the shop within 6 mos. of ownership.  Most problems were fixed with updated control modules but the ""click"" is still there and they can't figure it out.  Gas mileage is not as good as rated, 20 to 22 mpg is the best it delivered on a rating of 24.  If Chrysler could deliver better quality their designs would be tough for the competition to beat.  Nice vehicles, but quality suffers."

The entertainment system is tops. We went to Florida shortly after we got the van.  On the trip home from Dothan Ala. to Columbus Ga. We got 26.3 mpg! Not bad for a vehicle the size of a T & C. We were sold on Chrysler before we bought this one. We had 3 before this. Go get yourself one. You'll love it"

Highway mileage: 60 mph= 27- 38 mpg; 65-70 mph=23-24 mpg; local driving =14-16 mpg.  Van has stow n'go seating, no tvs or navigation system. Bought a Garman Nuvi GPS instead which is very satisfactory. Warranty work so far: adjust the latches on two doors and address rattle in overhead console via Chrysler bulletin by torquing bolts that hold the console to the ceiling and taping a loose wiring harness behind the front light indside the overhead console. In summary, we're very happy with this van."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Karen, 12/30/2008,Is it a lemon or is it the dealership?,3,"Bought my van begining of the year. So far, I have had quirky little problems. If the Keypod is not turned on and ""clicked back"" nothing works, heat, radio, lights. I took it in and of course, nothing wrong. Took it back in a 3 weeks later because if I do a ""california"" stop, it jerks foward. Dealership told me that I need to stop at a stop sign.  Lots and lots of brake dust flying out of my front tires. Said that was normal. Asked if I could get new brake pads put on, yes, for for a price. Sliding doors flew open or would not shut, fixed by new ""download"" repair. Now I just got back need all new ball bearings in tires. I'm going back to Chevy. "

Talk about fuel economy, 28 on a trip.18-19 around town. There isn't any foreign car or van that I think would compare to this van all around. I also like the idea my money is staying here in the USA. We need it .This van has enought room to bring everything we need to FL for our winter months."

I was and am so disappointed in the van. Everything breaks on it! The life time transmission well thank god for life time you will need it! Ours has been in the shop 8 times for the transmission, 2 times for plastic snapping off of the seats, 4 times for the squeek in the front, 1 for engine light, oh! lets not forget if you happen to scrape the bottom in the front skirt there is a clip (plastic no less) that holds the front bumper to the side panels that will break. That will cost $500 and a body shop..2 times for the alarm not working. I hate this van!Save your money!"

One surprise for me is front brake pads worn out totally at 20000 miles. one recall for radiator fix. Other than that, I have very pleasant experience with this car. consistently good mileage on highway (26.5) and local around 18mpg. With AC, playstation 2, radio I think that is a good mileage. "

I've owned a 1998 Grand Caravan with 310,000 miles on it and I never had to service it. With this crap I'am taking it in weekly. I should have a reserved parking stall at the dealer when I take in for servicing. It's comfortable riding"

Better gas mileage, haven't seen it yet.  3 months old and approx. 3,000 miles radio would lock up. Chrysler replaced radio.  1000 miles later radio did the same and transmission was leaking.  Chrysler said that they could not replicate the radio and that they just tighten the trans. pan.  They wanted it to happen and let them see the problem.  They said then that the software may be bad then.  But wanted to wait and see what happens.  Now while driving at night, at 11800 miles, all electrical flashes off, including headlights.  Scaried to drive it now.  Won't buy this product again.  Family vehicle or family death trap?    "
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Van Daddy, 02/17/2009,Great RES (Rolling Entertainment System),3,"This is our 2nd Chrysler product (1st was '02 Dodge Grand Caravan). The T&C has a very weak engine. Our old van was quicker with the same engine (3.8L). Our 2nd choice, the Odyssey, is much more impressive in the fun-to- drive factor as minivans go. The styling of the T&C is too blocky for my tastes. However, the T&C is all about what's on the inside. The dual DVDs, hard drive, and satellite radio made our 600+ mile trip to Myrtle Beach very pleasurable. The ride is very comfortable. The fit and finish is a little disappointing. The front door does not quite line up with the rear door, which is noticeable from the side mirror while driving. Overall a great value for the money."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,kakphx, 02/16/2009,Not sure I should have bought it...,3,"Took delivery 11/08 and right off the bat the back up camera did not function. I felt the dealership was trying to deny anything was ever wrong, but sure enough  Took on a trip to CA, rattling in the front, where the window and dash meet. Only happens when traveling over 60 miles an hour, but intermittently. Have had only one follow up phone call from the sales guy to see how things are going. Very disappointing to me. I had looked at the Toyota Sienna, but it was $5000 more in price with the same equipment.  Should I have spent the extra for a better vehicle? Time will tell. "

While I think the Honda may drive better, the price for this can't be beat! Honda was almost $6,000 more expensive and we didn't get nearly as many ""perks."" The dual DVD, power doors (including the rear) and the  space inside can't be beat. The Honda did not feel nearly as spacious and there weren't as many little places to put things. The inside of the car is very comfortable and easy to get around in. The back up camera is great. The option for the lifetime warranty is a good deal if you plan on keeping it for a long time. This is a great car at an amazing price, this is it! "

Waited 8 yrs to replace last one, loved it, had a hard time letting it go at 136,000+ miles and MANY memorable, comfortable family trips, but rebates were hard to pass up. Within first week, back in shop for vibration over 60 mph-shop balanced tires, still vibrates. Rumbles, shudders at times when in park; jerks forward with rolling stops. Compared to previous T&C vans: cheap plastic, leather and cloth mixed in places, uncomfortable rear seats, cheap hard ""leather"" steering wheel, stiffness, feel the bumps, increasing highway wind noise the longer I drive it, poor window tinting design everywhere. Middle console slides into floor storage doors."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Frustrated Owner, 03/22/2009,Do not Buy,2,We have only had this vehicle since October 2008 and it is now broke down in our driveway.  It was already in the shop once and they could not figure out what was wrong with it and now when we put it into drive it went in reverse. It has to have some type of serious transmission issues.  This is only the 2nd American made car I have bought and it is looking like I will be buying Toyota from now on.  I am extremely frustrated.

Chrysler signature series with swivel n go. only replaced the rotors and brakes twice. The worst thing that has happened to are van in the 80,000 miles is we had to replace the radiator hose and that was only 125 dollars at the dealership with labor. there is one annoyance were the center stack has its paint wear away because of resting your hands there while on the Mygig. the dash speakers also destort when at high sound levels.

We initially had problems start July 1st on the way to FL. Lee Chrysler Ft. Walton Bch, FL. said nothing was wrong and lied about the computer not having error codes about the engine. Georgia dealership found the codes that Lee Chrysler forgot to clear. Georgia dealership replaced the transmission.  At around 26,000 miles the gear shift became difficult to shift down to drive.  Local dealership changed the entire gear box. When my wife returned home the gear shift knob came off. Had to be towed in again. DONT BUY A CHRYSLER!"

It was advertised by Chrysler to have power mirrors included as standard equipment, and it came without them.  Chrysler will not install the mirrors at no cost to us, although it was advertised by Chrysler LLC.When I contacted Chrysler, (3 times) about no power mirrors, they told me it is the dealerships problem, however, the dealership and I agree, and we know it is Chrysler that is at fault. Chrysler will do nothing to remedy this problem, and I filed a BBB on the Chrysler LLC CO. and Chrysler would not even respond to this complaint. The body has an annoying rattle, and when you slow down to make a stop, it is audible. Also fluttering sound occurs."

We quickly have to hit the hazards and restart the car and hope no one hits us from behind. Our only savior has been the radar detector, which beeps out of control right before the car is about to stall out. Not safe or reliable, so were stuck paying for a Lemon that we cant even drive. Also have had issues with the ""Automatic"" door not closing & U-Connect was replaced. What lousy craftsmanship, it just goes to show American companies dont care about the American public or their safety. We will never buy American made again-lesson learned."

chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Jeff, 05/12/2009,Works Fine,4,I am a real shopper and the T&C Touring was by far the best choice between the Sienna and the Odessy. The T&C had the best layout and seating plus the stow and go is great. I have had zero problems with this van and I have had it for a year now. The traction control works very well in snow. I recommend this vehicle.
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,golddog, 01/02/2008,Chrysler back on top!,5,"We just purchased a 2008 Black Limited w/ navigation and sunroof.  Did not opt for DVD since no kids and 3 dogs.  Overall first impressions are great.  Smooth ride, comfortable, very quiet.  Fit and finish looks great.  Navigation is easy to use as is the bluetooth function.  Voice recognition is a little difficult to setup.  Previously owned a Toyota Sienna which had several recalls, not as comfortable, and overall did not impress.  Traded a 2007 Hyundai Entourage for Chrysler.  The Hyundai was a good van but lacked several features and depreciation faster than you could imagine.  Put this van at the top of your list!"
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Ben, 01/05/2008,Touch choice between T&C or Odyssey,4,"The Odyssey is awesome and absolutely a better drive at any trim level then the T&C. However, if you closely compare the standard feature set on the Honda and compare it to the T&C it becomes clear that if you care more about value and less about handling and performance (it's a minivan!) then the T&C wins. I bought a Touring T&C with the M package for 29,000 dollars. A similar Honda costs almost 4000 more at invoice. Personally I don't think the Honda's moon roof and engine superiority warrant a 4 thousand dollar difference.  Figure in Chrysler's life time drivetrain warranty along with it's feature set and you have a great value.  BTW - I think the Limited kills the T&Cs value over Honda."

The layout is better than our 2001 Odyssey.  The smaller engine definitely lacks power.  The automatic transmission tries to compensate, which causes the gas mileage to be a little lower than I would like.  But the you can shift gears yourself to compensate.  The DVD player is nice.  As are the wireless headphones.  The rear parking camera is great.  The stow and go gives a ton of interior space for storage.  The second glovebox is also nice.  After the transmission failure on our last van, the lifetime warranty on the Chrysler put us in this van over the entry level Toyota Sienna."

We LOVE it! We have only had a few minor things with door sensors which they fixed asap! Very comfortable and after test driving over 15 different types of vehicles, we really appreciate how smooth our van drives! The seats fold down and make it very versatile and the leather seats make it so much more comfortable than the cloth. Not all T&C are equal, but test drive it and if you are lucky enough to find one as great you'll love driving it all the time! We like the gear shift up by the steering wheel too!"

chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Annette, 01/10/2008,Carpool Heaven,4,"Swivel n go is the best for carpool. The kids pop in and out with so much ease.  The toughest part is deciding who gets to sit backward.  It rides smooth.  The entertainment options are super for a long car ride.  The LED lights make it so easy to drive at night and let kids still do homework, read books etc.  I really like the new exterior, less of an attempt at sporty --it's a minivan.  The MyGig is impressive, but can take too much attention while driving.  Love the Bluetooth built in.  Second row cupholders are only bottle on the door less than ideal.  "
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Satisfied in Pa., 06/14/2009,Got to have one,4,First mini-van I ever owned.  Got it because of the grand children.   Great vehicle.  Have 9000 miles on it.  no issues what so ever.  
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Crystal, 06/16/2009,Great vehicle!,5,"I can not say much bad about this minivan it rides very well, great on hihway mileage.  It gets over 500 MPG on the highway and it has alot of great features and things to kee children busy.  "
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,MH, 06/21/2009,We love it!,4,"Our T&C is the limited, which has the 253hp 4.0 L V6. We're REALLY glad we paid up for that! The ride is outstanding, acceleration is excellent, especially for a family hauler like this. We opted for the ""swivel and go"" seats, and our kid loves it, especially on long drives. even quick trips to the store are silent and peaceful with the satellite TV in the back. Seems like a really solidly built car."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Davedough, 06/22/2009,No wonder they're bankrupt,2,"We bought the van shortly after the arrival of our 2nd child. We figured we needed the room and went with the most popular model out there. One week after ownership, the tire monitor goes off and there's a leak in the rim. Dealer replaces the monitor. Week later, its back. Dealer fixes it. 2 months later, its back. Meanwhile, the side door has stopped closing all the way. Dealer takes 4 stabs at it before ordering all new mounting parts for the door. 15,000 miles into ownership and the brakes and rotors are so far gone that they are in need of $300 replacement. Dealer tells me its common for this van and I can expect that every $15,000 miles. Value dropped so now I cant sell it. Yay Chrysler"
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,mad, 06/23/2009,2008 Town & Country Minivan Stinks,2,"What stinks? My new 2008 Chrysler Minivan. While driving home after purchase back hatchet came open without any warning. After driving turned engine off and key would not release. Back passenger doors do not close properly have to use handle most of the time.  Brakes & rotor went out at 22,000 miles. Rotten egg smell. Air conditioning stopped working. Have taken to dealer over 10 times and they can not fix or duplicate any of the problems the first time. It takes them at least 4 times to get anything addressed. Dealership has been no help. And Chrysler has been even less. Way to go Chrysler.  I will never buy another Chrysler product. Why can't you fix anything the 1st time? Chrysler stinks"
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,jim, 06/30/2009,never again,3,"We have had toyota,honda vans in the past. we traded in our toyota for the new chrysler t and c limited. We have had 4 navigation systems replaced,front bearings. If you can imagine we took the van in for an oil change and the dealer said our front brakes were metal to metal and the rears were 80%. The charge was $300.00 after a year our 6 year old twins have out grew the back seats,no leg room. Never Again."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,jerry, 07/11/2009,Piece of junk,2,"Traded a 2000 T&C for this piece of junk.  Radio locked up on one channel, rear bumper cover bowed up, gear shift noisy and hanging up, tires noisy, and interior is so noisy you cannot hear radio.  Cruise control is terrible.  It goes from 1750 rpms to 2500 almost continuosly.  Then the anti theft switch went bad while in drive way and had to have it towed.  It took three weeks to get new switch.  It has about 16000 miles and the tires are making loud noise and it appears also brakes may need work.  No wonder they are going bankrupt. I made a mistake buying this instead of Honda or anything else."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Dave S, 07/14/2009,Better than Honda!,5,We looked at several vans and the Chrysler was the best all around value. My neighbor has an 06 oddyssy and even he admits the honda is junk and after riding in my chrysler is considering trading the honda in!

chrysler,town-and-country,2008,TOm, 07/21/2009,Great For My Three Sons,4,"We purchased the 2008 T & C after talking ourselves out of the ""Loser Cruiser"" stigma.  We have a2007 Durango, which is awesome, but not the family mover we needed.  We traded my old sedan for the T & C and have not looked back.  THe van is simply the most incredible, family oriented vehicle on the market.  The DVD system is great for the boys (ages 4 and 2- year-old twins).  After owning for a month we packed it up and headed ten hours south to Virginia Beach.  Van performed great.  We had it to the dealer once for a DVD door that was sticking when trying to close...Scranton Dodge swapped out the entire system and even changed the oil..on them!  So far, van is exceeding our expectations."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,tiredof the game, 08/03/2009,Should have got the Honda,1,"Bought this piece of American junk in 08. So far the doors have needed work, the heater/ac blower motor works intermittently, the dealer of course cant find a problem. Just got the front brakes done at 23,000 miles. My guess is the use of sub grade materials, poor acceleration on highway, brake calipers frozen on rear brakes and dealership tells me it could be a week before they come in. My hope is Chrysler disappears from the business. I will never buy another. Completely sickened by the company and their unwillingness to fix any problem unless it's out of the warranty period. Bunch of crooks..."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Neil, 07/30/2009,Love it... BUT,4,"On the whole my wife, kids and I love the van. As our first new car we like all the gadgets and the new car feel. BUT... after 10,000 miles I can hear both sliders make a creaking noise when taking off and just before coming to a stop. Also when hitting the brakes I get a vibration in the steering wheel and in the whole van.The faster I'm going when I hit the brakes the worse it is. After reading some of the reviews, this sounds like a rotor, pad problem. I may be wrong but I don't think a 42,000 dollar van [Paid 30] should do that. We also have the pass slider that wont close all the way unless done by hand. I haven't brought it in yet, so we'll see. "
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Tim, 08/24/2009,lemon,3,Got this brand new in July 08. May 09 - AC completely dead. Was told it is a known problem. It took two weeks to get the part. June 09 - luggage rack knob twists off. June 09 - transmission completely went out traveling to SC. Dealer in Florence told me there's nothing wrong though it could not move when towed in on Saturday. A week later traveling home transmission went out in VA - had to have a brand new one installed in VA (I live in Ohio). Was told this is a common problem. Not willing to pay expenses related to extra nights stay and travel from VA to OH and back. August 09 rear brakes froze - told known problem - 10 days now and they still can't find parts. HELP ME
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Do NOT buy this!!!, 08/18/2009,Do NOT buy this!!!,2,"I bought this 45,000 vehicle in 6/08. By end of July the air had quit. Took it to get fixed. 2 weeks later I discovered an air conditioner leak that had MUSHROOMS growing in front passenger floorboard. I will send pics if any one doesn't believe this! Also brakes were messed up (crunching sound) at about 4000 miles. Took several times with them saying nothing wrong and finally had to be replaced @ 21000 miles. The all electric 3rd row seat had 2 b fixed b/c motor quit working on one side. The sliding passenger doors don't always close & has to be manually closed. Oh and the brakes are ""crunching"" again @ 30000 miles. Presets on the Satellite radio only (not fm) disappear & hav 2 b reprogrammed"
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Happy Driver, 01/27/2008,Great Decision,4,"My wife and I are extremely happy with our purchase! The Town and Country is spacious, convenient, loaded with features-- 2 DVDs, GPS Nav (screen acts as 3rd TV in park), Swivel n' Go. We opted for the manual 3rd row reconfigure; the power feature is nice, but not required since manual reconfiguring is easy. Gas mileage is pretty much as advertised on the sticker (much better than the SUV we traded in!), but could be improved w/ a diesel engine. We test drove a 4.0L in the limited, and it was peppier, but we are happy with the 3.8 (and we're used to an overpowered SUV). Overall, an excellent product from Chrysler! Shoppers- also look at the Dodge Grand Caravan... only difference is looks."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Jenn, 09/11/2009,Done with American,2,"We bought the van due to transmission issues with our 1998 Tahoe with over 150000 miles, thinking we could avoid repairs for some time. What a joke. First it was DVD/NAV system problems, then the AC, NAV again, Front brakes at 23000 miles, Folding seats don't come up, Transmission Valve body- while driving to Soccer Toury- I coach need to be there on time- Stuck me in match box car for rental with three children, luggage, and equipment. This was Friday, did not get van back for 6 days and had to drive over 150 miles to pick up. Now at 35000 the rear brakes need to be replaced- thing is they don't have an after market brake YET it will cost $195 for this. It makes me sick- Never again!!!!!!!!"
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,RCBAL, 09/14/2009,"Brakes,Transmission & Electrical",4,"Brake pads went out at 18,000 the Transmission went out and rebuilt at 18,0000. Van quits running and the side doors fail open (SAFETY CONCERN) in the shop now. Contacted Chrysler and the dealership they are looking for the problem. This is the third major issue since we bought it 6/30/08."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,massvanguy, 09/14/2009,My 2008 Has Been Excellent,4,"We have an early build 20087, and it has been great. The only issue we have had has been the premature brake wear (that I caught right before 12K miles so dealer covered the cost). The fuel economy of this van has been fantastic, we have taken several road trips with full cargo area, and nothing at all is creaking, making noise, or otherwise working poorly. It is super comfortable, and looks great in brilliant silver. This is my first T&C as I could not buy a Honda since my Accord has had 4, yes 4, transmissions and a front end repaint since being bought new in 2002."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,t710, 10/10/2009,town and country review,3,"Brakes and tires need replaced at 24000 miles. There is a constant rattle in the overhead entertainment system that the dealership cannot keep fixed. Fuel economy is not great. Advertises 24 but with my family of six we have never gotten to 24, usually more like 22 on the hwy with a combined average of 18."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,David York, 10/15/2009,Excellent Van,4,"I have owned 5 new mini-vans since 1986, and this is be far the best one I've owned.  We like all the extra features and have had not trouble of any kind since I purchased it.  This is much improved from the 2005 model I owned. The 2005 model was the worst one I've owned.  I would like a little better mileage, but it's not bad for a heavy van.  I think a lot of people complain about their vans, but they probably complain about most everything they have. I also question how they drive and service them.  I have driven over 1,500,000 miles in 17 new GM, Ford and Chrysler products, and never had much trouble with any of them. Don't drive them like a race car and service them properly."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,dimsum, 11/09/2009,Buyer Beware Brake Life,2,"We purchased a certified used 2008 T&C LX with 3000 miles in January. New brakes and rotors required at 17K miles. Based on other online reviews and some quick math, it became apparent we would have to pay for a complete brake replacement every 15K miles or so. Wear items are not covered under warranty so we were looking at a $800 hit every year. I can understand a brake replacement at 30-40K but not annually. Clearly there is a design problem with the 2008s.  After much back and forth with the dealer and Chrysler corporate, we agreed to a $250 deductible. Once fixed, we traded in vehicle. Sorry Chrysler!"
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Donny T., 12/20/2009,Happy with Our Van,4,"Bought our van in august 2008. It is our first van and we bought it because we wanted to do some traveling. We live in Pennsylvania and just did our second round trip to  central Florida. Its been fun to drive, smooth &  reliable. The only problem weve had is the air stopped blowing cold on the way down. Fortunately it was just a line leak and it was fixed at the dealership in Winter Haven, fla in one day and the air was icy once again. We are very glad we bought this type of van and the first 20,000 miles have been great. Only slight disappointment is the gas mileage is not as good as chrysler said-about 22 on the highway and only 10-11 in the city."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Terrible Van!!!, 01/21/2010,HORRIBLE,2,"Like many other 2008 T&C owners, this was our third Chrysler minivan, and, like many other 2008 T&C owners, this will be our last!  To be told by the dealer they know things are problems, such as premature brake wear, premature tire wear, and side doors that open and close on their own, and THEN to be told those items are not covered by Chrysler, and THEN to be told by CHRYSLER that those items are known issues, but again that they will not be covered, is just too much.  This vehicle was very, very disappointing, and the service from both the dealership and the corporate offices was the worst I have ever received from anyone.  Too bad, because the previous two vans were great.  Never again."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,concerned, 01/24/2010,over drive down all hills,4,"I love the van and it is a great fit for my family. It is the second Chrysler product for me in 20 years. The only issue I have is the van will not hold itself back going downhill regardless of selecting low gear at the top. The brakes will be gone in no time, we live at the top of a serious hill. I expected the 6 speed to handle this, very underwhelmed with this aspect."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Jerry Whitaker, 01/18/2010,Will buy another.,4,"My 2008 with luxury option package was my 5th Chrysler product van. Other than a very minor rattle in one door, it was totally reliable for the two years that I owned it. A flood in Florida has unfortunatly caused the van to be a right off. The incredible versatility of this van is the reason I will definitly buy another. The 4 litre engine will provide ample power although the 3.8 served me well.  Economy not bad for a vehicle of this size.  Dealer service has been good in both Canada and Florida."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,David, 02/19/2010,Not big problems. At least by now.,4,We bought this van used about 4 months ago and we have not had big issues with it. The only one issue with it are the front breaks. It looks like it needs rotors and brakes replaced. I do not think is covered under the warranty so I am going to get that repleced by my self. It has 23000 miles only. I also had a brand new  2009 vw routan which is manufactured by Chrysler Canada for VW and it had the same brakes issue and I just had 3000 on it.  
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,minivan driver n ga, 02/27/2010,Why not fix the known problem?,4,This is our first minivan. Heard great things about this van and it was a great fit for the growing family. The breaks on this van has been a problem  since around oil change number 3. We do not live in an area where hills would be a concern. This van has been in for break repairs and the service man has stated that they are a problem. That was comforting to hear.  The heat that rises under the dash makes driving in the spring and summer uncomfortable as well. We want to support American made but this companies's van is not customer friendly. 
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,disappointed, 03/01/2010,Disappointed in the Chrysler! Not safe!,1,"With the car less than two years old and only 14700 in miles, there was a pulsing in the brakes that resulted in having the front brakes replaced.  At 16500 miles the back brakes need replacing and it needs two new front tires as well because the wheel alignment was to be checked during the 1st brake inspection-not done.  All at our own expense! The dealership stated that the brakes may have been designed too small or incorrectly as to not handle the weight and size of the van and nothing to do with the warranty and the brakes are not covered.Chrysler has not shown any concern for safety of the van, nor a concern to get things fixed correctly. No concern in their own car! Disappointed!!"
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Justin, 03/01/2010,Braking System Issues!!!!,3,"I had to get four new brakes pads, two front rotars, and two rear calipers after only 17,000 miles. There is some severe braking issues that Chrysler needs to correct."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,BigJim, 03/04/2010,Great van after 18 months of ownership!,4,"I have read the reviews and I must say, I'm very surprised at the number of people complaining or having issues. Our van has been ""perfect"" to date.  Not a single issue!  Runs great, no rattles, tires look good, brakes are just dandy.  I change the O&F every 3k and rotate tires every 6k.  This van is meant to be driven AS A VAN.  No chronic brake pedaling - no hard cornering/braking - and no rapid acceleration. I've seen how most people drive.  If I were their car/van - I'd want to cough, hiccup & breakdown in hopes they'd trade me in so that I could possibly acquire a new owner who will drive me as I require & regularly maintain to my needs. "

chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Janet Kennedy, 03/11/2010,Don't buy this car,1,"At 15,000 miles tires needed to be replaced no discount for poor quality tires. Brakes and rotors bad they were good enough to split the cost. Aren't brakes and tires supposed to last longer. Never have I had such bad luck with a car -electronics keep going bad. Locked out of car due to electrical problems. Tire pressure light kept indicating tires did not have pressure. The worst tires ever. Dealer not cooperative. This is the worst quality car for 40000 I have ever owned. Don't recommend to anyone."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Oscar's Momma, 03/26/2010,Brake/Rotor Overhaul at 26K!! HORRIBLE,3,"First of all, I only leased my MV because my baby, my beautiful 204 baby blue Pacifica, was totaled in a front end collision. Everyone walked away from that with only minor aches and pains - a true testament to the early models of the Pacificas. We went to the same dealership that we bought the Pacifica, only to learn that the Pacificas were being discontinued. So we leased the T&C van instead. I have 26k miles and have to replace FOUR rotors and FOUR brakes, for over $700. On a leased car. Still under warranty. I thought the rotors were included between the bumpers, but apparently not in this universe. AVOID AT ALL COST."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,NYCmom, 04/06/2010,Averaging 11 mpgs in this van,1,"Within 2 years & less than 16,000 miles, i have had A/C problems 2x, sliding door issues, 3 tires w/leaks, battery needed to be replaced (i wound up paying a shop after a dealership said it would take them a week), glitches in entertainment system & braking! Chrysler fixed some (i still have A/C & and tire problems which i hope they will address) but gas mileage has also been horrific. Driving on highway I manage to get 16 & I am not a fast driver; I also do not idle the car, but barely get 11 driving locally. it is big and boxy, which some might like; we did good use of the DVDs after the repair software, but I still have to turn the engine off on sometimes to get it to work. 3rd is decent.

chrysler,town-and-country,2008,my05hammer, 04/12/2010,POOCH!!,3,"I bought this mini van for my wife and 4 kids.  It has the 3.3L V6 that is a TOTAL FRIGGEN DOG!!!!  The real problem is the STUPID ""fly by wire"" throttle, if you mash the accelerator to the floor it only limps along and will NOT open up the throttle to 100%.  I consider this a HUGE safety hazard.  If you drive in heavy traffic you DO NOT WANT THE 3.3 L V6. It does not have the power to get out into traffic and up to speed in time to keep from getting run down by other traffic. Other than that, it's a mini van.  I drove it from Illinois to Arizona, then up through Utah to Colorado and back to Illinois with the wife, 5 kids, and luggage on board.  It was crammed but comfortable."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,mattcrys, 04/13/2010,Disappointed,3,"Just like all the reviews before me. We had a lot of problems with rotors and brakes. We replaced brakes at 16,000 miles and just now at 47,000. I mean , come on! We have had many different vehicles before and never had to replace brakes like this.WE replaced rotors at 47,ooo miles also. At 35,000 we had to replace a piece in the transmission. My old Town and Chrysler was never this bad. Chrysler really needs to fix this problem.My touch screen radio and dvd player also was replaced at 20,000 miles, and sometimes when you start the van it won't come on for a few minutes. next time we buy, it won't be from Chrysler."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Worst EVER!!!, 04/19/2010,Worst Purchase Ever,1,"I purchased this van 4 months ago. Since then it has been in the shop for problems with door alignment 4 times. The motor on the fan has gone out and been replaced and have replaced the front brakes. This has all occurred before 36,000 miles. The transmission also slips, so I am sure that will need to be replaced at my expense as well. I hate to see what is to come with this van until I can trade it for something that has better quality."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,soccer mom, 04/21/2010,Worst vehicle we have EVER owned!,2,"Two years old - multiple problems with sliding doors, cost me $300 to fix an A/C line that failed.  Dealer AND corporate both know this is a problem. I still got a bill. Engine has made a weird pinging noise since we bought it. Svc mgr has all but told me I'm being ridiculous ""They all do it"" Really? Show me how all T&Cs on your lot are doing this. Rear of van started pouring smoke while idling.  Paid $89 tow bill to be told they have no idea why it did it & can't reproduce it. Runs hotter than it did, though. Going in tomorrow for horrible squealing from the rear end while driving & turning right.  Expect to hear it's the horrible brakes. Lots more. Wish I could send it over a cliff!"

Now they tell me my rear rotors have rust & need to be replaced or I have to continue to listen to a very loud squeak. I don't get it, obviously they need a recall on 2008 town & country minivans. never will buy again."

Do Not buy this vehicle you will regret it, it looks all nice but it's not, it gives so much mechanical problems. i bought a new car not to get any kinds of mechanical problems at least for the first years but it is problems after problem after problem, so like i said before if you are smart DO NOT BUY THIS CAR."

One year later after the problem was ""fixed"" I have the same issue with the air conditioning which is not a lot of fun when the mercury reaches 90 degrees. I think Chrysler needs to try to improve their quality standards I would not purchase again."

My husband has a V8 Nissan Titan and hauls a huge gutter machine in a 16ft covered trailer to the city every day and gets better gas mileage than my van. I am paying more for gas to ride the kids around for their nap during the middle of the day than my husband uses for work all day. It is insane! I can't even believe how bad it is, I thought someone was siphoning my gas. After reading the reviews I can say I haven't had any problems with the electronics yet, but my brakes went out at 16,000 miles too. Just like others here. I was told it was because I was a bad driver. Yah, with three little babies in the back seat, I am so wild and reckless, right? OMG!"

This was the most expensive vehicle I ever purchased.  This was also my third Dodge/Chrysler/Plymouth van since 1999. In November 2009 I drove the van to Florida for Thanksgiving.  On Thanksgiving day the rear brakes seized and the following day a local dealer informed me I had to replace the brakes, rotors, pads and a caliper.  This was $620.00 out of pocket.   I love my van and the boys enjoy the DVD player.  The van is very comfortable and I find there is plenty of leg room, even in the 3rd row.   I have replaced the front brakes and now I am having issues with the A/C.  Chrysler own up!"
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Angie, 06/03/2010,Will never consider a Chrysler again,3,"I bought this mini van because I have 3 children, ages 11-15 that are very active in sports, requiring us to travel a lot.  Like everyone else, had to replace the brakes at 16,000 miles. About a month before the warranty ran out, I got a leak in the a/c and another leak in a transmission valve.  I want to trade it in but am so upside down am afraid I will end up in worse shape than I'm in now.  I have a 2000 Ford Expedition that has never required anything other than basic maintenance.

Now, at 33,000 they need replacing again, and so do the rotors. It was suggested that it is my driving. In 20 years I have never had this problem before, so I don't think so. I am also having problems with the a/c, it doesn't cool well. The recall didn't fix it, either. And now, it is leaking something! I am seriously considering trading in this piece of junk for a Lexus with twice the miles and 2 years older. I chose this van because of the styling and the price. I never thought after 22 mos. I would be looking for a new car again. I will never buy another Chrysler. "
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,2flyqt, 06/30/2010,Ridiculous,3,"This car has been a nightmare, it has been in the shop more times than I can count.  I had to replace my brakes within 14k miles & it was not covered in my bumper to bumper warranty, if they would have worn out 1000 miles earlier it would have been covered!  My AC broke within a year, and they refused to fix it, said it's not a covered part even though I have an extended bumper to bumper warranty that I paid for with my original financing.  I have had a wheel bearing & hub replaced, it was covered but they still charged me the 100.00 deductible even those these are not normal things that would break within a year of having a car. Now i there is an electrical problem, unbelievable!"
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,always in shop, 07/06/2010,Dont buy it,3,"The dealership was great but ended up with monthly problems. Overhead console rattle, A/C went bad more than once, front brakes replaced at about 15,000 miles. Adjustable pedal switch does not work. Van started making loud squealing noise while driving. Shop told us no problem found, next day rear brake billowing smoke. Had to have towed. Trading it in for a Honda when we get it out of the shop! disappointed. Thought the touring would be a keeper."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Mandy, 07/02/2010,Save your money do not buy!,2,"Monthly we have to take our van in for re-calls or fixing of some sort. This van has had multiple brake issues. We now have problems with electronic parts such as the doors and the radio.  We have replaced brakes 3 times at 44,000 miles, and replaced a hose in the air conditioner at 20,000 miles. Currently it sounds like an airplane landing when we drive.  I feel like Chrysler took our money and ran and we are stuck with this lemon of a van."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Ann Marie, 07/12/2010,Recent recalls have taken care of proble,3,"I have had problems with my brakes. I had only 5% left of my brake pads at 21,000 miles. Thanks to their recent recall I had my front brakes replaced minus a $50 deductible (which is ridiculous!) and my a/c hose was also recalled and was low on freon due to the leak. Both have been fixed and no more problems. I also had a recall on the temperature gauge which I never receive a notice on. I had a problem in the past with the sliding doors just opening up on their own AFTER I locked the doors - but the dealership also fixed that no charge. I also am experiencing problems with my transmission but it never seems to happen when at the dealer. New prob the car sounds like a boat at the exhaust!"
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Annfromjersey, 07/19/2010,More problems than worth!,3,"Oh where should I start. Front & back brakes replaced, a/c hose, 3rd bench not locking in place, transmission slipping, squeaking noises from frame when you go over bumps, driver's seat broke the first day we got it home. Almost blew up the engine with a oil leak in the manifold. I never saw a drop in the driveway and oil light came on one time! More problems then my 12 yr old explorer! At least the brakes are being reimbursed! If I wouldn't lose so much money trading it in and still have car payments, I would trade it in. So far the dealership has been good with repairs."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Joe D., 07/18/2010,Chrysler Builds Junk,2,This was our second Chrysler van and will be the last.  An absolute miserable experience that we will not repeat.  Too many problems to write about; just read more of these reviews and you will know what I mean.  We gave Chrysler a second chance after the first problem van we bought and it was a mistake.  Chrysler management and the UAW should be ashamed of themselves for taking money for this junk; then act like it's business as usual.  No wonder they are bankrupt.  Got rid of the Chrysler and bought a Honda; nice to have a vehicle that can be trusted.
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,sasa, 08/03/2010,This van is a Headache,2,"I too own a 2008 Chrysler town and country van with the same issues as everyone else. The brakes/rotors are constantly grinding and squealing as if they need to be replaced but the mechanic says they still have plenty of life in them. When i did replace them, the noise subsided for a while then came right back. I recently changed the hub bearing to no avail and now I am considering changing the stabilizer bar; not sure. The ac does not cool well and there is clinking noises coming from the rear when i ride over minor road bumps. This van was very poorly manufactured. I am very upset because this was a recent purchase this year 2010. I too should have got the Honda or Nissan Quest. "
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,SCHIZ, 08/11/2010,Undecided,3,"We just traded our 2004 Cadillac srx in for the 08 town & country. The van is fully loaded and has several nice options but we have already had to call aaa to have it started on 100 degree day. The key would not turn in the ignition, ended up disconnecting the battery and it worked. Now there is a rattling sound coming from the rear. It drives very smoothly on the highway, of course not as smooth as the Cadillac, but we are getting over 100 miles per tank better gas mileage on an 18 gallon tank. Only at 21k miles so warranty should cover the rattling sound. The interior is very nice looking but you can tell it is very cheap material. "
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Karen, 08/11/2010,Omg! Do not buy this van!,3,"I don't even know where to begin.  The first month I had this van, I was thrilled, and even wrote a good review here.  Two years later, I'm ready to stop paying and let it get repossessed! Within 16,000 miles, my front brakes and rotors had to be replaced to the tune of $350 - and Chrysler said it was my driving habits?  Well, a year later, they sent out a letter to everyone admitting that yeah, maybe there's a brake issue and they will reimburse everyone for repairs. While I'm waiting for that check, my brakes and rotors had to be replaced again -  21,000 miles later! But this time, it was my front and back brakes, so it cost me $600! Chrysler has a serious problem here. "
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,John C, 09/03/2010,Never again,1,"This Town and Country design was horrible.  We've owned 3 minivans from Chrysler and this weight ratio to brake pad design caused us to replace the brakes every 12K miles.  To top it off, the brake pad extended warranty was voided for us because we went to Midas after we were tired of paying the dealer ridiculous rates.  We will never buy another Chrysler product because of this experience and the subsequent experience with Chrysler Customer Assistance."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,fyrewyngz, 03/15/2011,NERVOUS,5,"Bought 2008 T&C to replace a HORRID 02 Windstar that cost $$$ on repairs. It was recalled 12/2010 for rear axle. Ford didn't have parts so I drove a Sienna rental for 2.5 months. Hated the Sienna! Got my Windstar back. One week later the tranny blew! 127k miles! Traded for T&C. One week later I received another Windstar recall! Glad to be rid of it! T&C had 44k and in new condition. Runs great! Tranny is peculiar after sitting overnight. Shifts funny into 2nd but then is fine afterwards. So many negative reviews here make me nervous! Oddly, so many negative reviews have 3-4 stars! Hope I didn't make a mistake!"
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Gus, 02/02/2008,Highly Recommended,4,"Over the last 5 years I have owned BMW's, Mercedes, Infiniti, but never American.  I must say with the Chrysler T&C I was very impressed, and am very pleased with it.  We traded a BMW X5 for this vehicle, and I don't regret it at all.  All the ammenities of the European cars built right into a minivan.  Chrysler did a great job with this minivan!"
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,IrishPirate, 02/19/2008,Great Minivan,5,"Don't know why they call them ""mini"" van? but we love this Chrysler - our first one!  Smooth,  extremely quiet,  no problems.  mileage could be better but with 3000 miles, i guess 20 mpg overall is ok for now?"
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Vic, 02/26/2008,Great New Look,5,"Three years ago we decided it was time to move out of our minivan and into a full size car.  After all, the kids were grown and why did we need a minivan any more. We missed having enough room for 6 adults and we're tired of paying delivery charges  for larger purchases.  We did some test drives and the new Chrysler Town and Country really stood out from the rest.  Driver and passenger comforts of the T & C  exceeded all the others. We love the leg room for the front seat passenger (wife couldn't cross ankles in Honda's Odyssey) and the passenger side 8 way power seats. The new look is also very impressive."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,kalena, 04/09/2012,Total piece of junk!!,2,"I purchased a new 2008 Town & Country Touring minivan with the ""Swivel & Go"" seating.
It is now 4 years old, and it is by far the biggest piece of junk I have ever owned!!
There are so many problems with it, 700 characters isn't enough to cover all of them, so here's a summary:
constantly needs new brake pads and rotors, leather seats are cracking (and this car is a garaged vehicle), dash clock on touchscreen has gone out twice, various parts of trim on interior and exterior repeatedly fall off, rear electric doors constantly breaking, multitude of engine problems - the list goes on.
I will never purchase another Chrysler again!"
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,erikpaco, 08/22/2011,Terrible Vehicle,2,"I have had all the same problems everyone else has complained about on here.
Brakes replaced every year and now in for the brakes again.
The part that makes it even funnier is that I had the transmission replaced about a year ago and it now has a hard shift problem and they are telling me that it is the software.
I have to pay for the software updates on the transmission.
Why would I need to pay for something that is a problem that I have no control of?
Chrysler I thoguht was a high end vehicle manufacturer, I am finding now that is such a POC.
The dealership has told me many times before that they couldnt find a problem when I brought it in before hand.
DO NOT BUY!!"
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,Mom 2 3, 02/29/2008,Smooth Ride,4,"This is actually our 2nd Town & Country purchase.  We had absolutely no problems with our last one, just ran the mileage up and loved the improved look of the new 2008 models.  We opted for a darker interior as we have 3 kids and they tend to spill every now and then - seats and carpet are stain proofed!  Nice for the passengers to be able to open all of the back windows.  Center console is great..lots of cupholders throughout. We looked at the swivel and go seating and there just wasn't enough knee room with the seating arrangement.  We opted for the stow n go which is very convenient - tons of extra storage capacity underneath ."
chrysler,town-and-country,2008,michele, 10/23/2007,All around nice van,5,"When my lease was up on my Jeep, I was going to purchase another SUV.  However, upon returning to the selling dealer, I looked over the new body style Town and Country.  I loved it, I never wanted to be a soccer mom, but it have every option and the new styling makes it look more sporty and lower to the groud.  It is super comfortable and the new engine is quiet."
chrysler,town-and-country,2009,Carol P, 04/14/2010,Transmission Problems,3,"Love my van accept for clunking in transmission when I slow down to around 25 to 20 MPH, it jerks and clunks. Taken to dealer twice, they of course can find nothing wrong. I accelerated the van last week (passing a car) the van started jerking and losing power, when I slowed up the jerking stopped and, when I accelerated, the I got the same jerking, again dealer could find nothing wrong. They rebooted the transmission on their computer which did nothing. Very disappointed that a new car clunks and jerks and the sad thing is that I can't get it fixed. If it isn't doing it when I bring it in, they can't help me. I have to live with annoying problems everyday on a new Car!"
chrysler,town-and-country,2009,, 05/23/2012,Don't buy the Town and Country,2,"We purchased a 2009 Town and Country LX with extended warranty and a few months after we got it, the transmission didn't want to downshift.
It cleared up a few days later.
Recently we went across country with our van and the transmission acted up!
Took it to Chrysler and they gave us a brand new 2012 version for a rental.
Bad mistake.
Had problems with that too.
Engine light came on and the red lighting bolt light too while driving on the highway.
It went away a week later. Stayed on for a few days and it went away again!
After picking up our van from Chrysler, the transmission went out while we were on the highway! Dealer told me they changed the soloenid pack, so what now?"
chrysler,town-and-country,2009,rscott68, 05/18/2013,Very nice family mover!,4,"We bought our 09 T&C used about 1 year ago.
It had 43k miles then and has about 58k now.
During that time we've been pleased with the vehicle.
It's comfortable, quiet, and gets mileage you would expect for a fairly heavy minivan.
We're getting about 23 mpg highway, 19 mpg town.
We traded on 05 base T&C that we'd owned for about 6 yrs.
It had nearly 170,000 miles and could have gone further with it but thought it was time to move on."
chrysler,town-and-country,2009,tgrnva, 06/17/2015,09 Town and Country...Don't do it!,2,"I bought this car new for my growing family.  We have  had so many issues I can't remember them all....lets see, had to change the brake pads and rotors at 45,000 miles, have had to replace the radiator, oil leaks, air conditioner whistles, and transmission is on its way out.  I have had other problems with tubes cracking, plastic parts breaking, drivers side door wont unlock, and had to replace the wire harness for the drivers side sliding door.  I know I am missing 3 or 4 more things, even the dealer wasn't surprised, but still didn't cut me a break.  Buy a Honda."
chrysler,town-and-country,2009,weeniedog, 03/23/2011,Transmission,4,"I bought mt 2009 T&C used with 47,000 miles. I did a test drive and of course it drove wonderfully. The dealership was really anxious to get me into the vehicle. I too experience transmission issues. slow sluggish hesitant when cold. acts like it is low on trans fluid. Crysler dealer checked & said they put some part on it and its fixed. $110.00 2 weeks after I bought it... It still tries to shift to fast. If you drive like a grandmaw it acts ok. But if you drive it normal with some good acceleration it kinda worries me. I too love this van I just wish I could get a straight answer/truthful answer about the trans.. They say I have a loaded warranty. Wierd, It didn't pay for the 110.00 part.."
chrysler,town-and-country,2009,Forrest, 01/07/2017,"A flashy car sure to fly off the lot, but...",1,"They probably had you at navigation and bluetooth. Plus those stow and go seats seemed nifty. Your kids were probably captivated by the dual screen dvd player, neon mood lights, and the second row heated seats. Not to mention the ability to hook up a game system in the back seat, but all of the luster of the technology starts to wear off with use. The acceleration is disgusting while interior cabin noise can't be overlooked (especially in the back). Eventually you get a recall notice in the mail for something that shouldn't have been messed up. Then more and more. The dealership is now uninterested in your cars problems, after all they made the sale, right? Now you're stuck with a death trap that has sliding doors that sound like chainsaws when they latch and cheap plastic trim that seems to become more and more generic looking. After 114,000 miles your van won't shift out of 3rd gear because the transmission failed. A transmission on a 7 year old car that was regularly serviced and cared for. The dealership wants $6,000 which is how much the car is worth at this point because it's depreciation is so severe. This is what we went through. It now sits in a junkyard. A seven year old van that's in perfect structural condition along with the interior. The van may look cool, but Chrysler isn't concerned about the wellbeing of your family. The crash tests look startling and the unreliableness could leave your family on the side of the road. Don't be captivated by cool features for an unbeatable price.

chrysler,town-and-country,2009,Happy Dad, 07/21/2009,Good Job Chrysler!!!!!!!!,3,Bought this after my TYoyota sienna lease was up and happy I did. So far it has performed well and me and my wife love the dual DVD screens for the rear seats!!!!(we actually can have a conversation). Also love the Sat. radio and the power gate and doors.
chrysler,town-and-country,2009,Robert, 03/05/2009,1st Minivan,5,"My wife and I just purchased our 1st minivan at age 62.  I love all aspects of the Town & Country.  The driving force in our purchase was the stow and go seating.  With the seats stowed we can place an air mattress in the rear and let my wife with back problems rest.  We have found no problems, not one, so far.  We are looking forward to many retirement trips in this mini van."

It was time to change and I just did the same and got another T&C. The touring is exceptionally luxurious and comes with lots of options. Fun to drive, accelerates well, and very comfortable. "

The other car (G6 or Grand- Am) came across into our lane.  It impacted just outside of the driver frame rail pushing the tire and axle up under the floor pan.  Front end was destroyed, driver door slightly deformed but driven back into slider door.  Driver A-Piller kinked. Passenger fender moved away from vehicle. Air bags deployed.  Driver door encroached in just a bit.  Other than that, the entire cockpit stayed in tact (to the naked eye). My son was in the seat behind my and nothing got even close to him.

chrysler,town-and-country,2009,8255Town&Country, 08/16/2009,I really like this minivan,5,"I wrote this review as a rebuke to the ""professional"" reviews on this site. The touring model is a great value.  The package I got has features that would costs many thousands more on a Honda or Toyota. Leather, cruise, 2 dvd's, hard drive music, satellite radio, 3 zone temp, auto side and rear door, power windows all around (including side and vent) 6 speed trans, auto start, backup camera, power driver and passenger heated seats, and a good warranty all for under $27K. I recently went on a highway trip and the gas mileage averaged 23 mpg.  Sure its no Prius, but I moved 2 small accent tables, a large cooler, luggage, and still had comfortable seating for 3. Handling and ride is great."
chrysler,town-and-country,2009,John, 05/02/2009,"I wanted a truck, she wanted an SUV.",4,"This auto satisfied everything we were looking for in every category. The comforts, the cargo ability, the gadgets, styling, price, and even its ability to maneuver in tight areas. It has truly made our life more streamlined and functional with having 2 children; not to mention the interior styling is as luxurious as it is functional. The exterior is more bold with strong modern lines. The previous models were way to soft for me, especially the front and rear fascias. There is nothing weak or meek with this much more handsome model. The interior was truly more luxurious than the Odyssey, Quest, Traverse, Acadia, F150, 1500 and a host of other SUV's, trucks & mini's we considered."

We have been to 3 different dealerships and nobody can fit it.  My car juts forward and engine revs into the red as I am driving at least once a week.  I have been told it is a new model and they are working on the kinks.  I was also told it has a life time warranty, so why should I worry.  I told them if my car blows up on the highway a warranty is not going to save my life or the car behind me hitting me when I jut.  I can't wait for my lease to be up in another year and a half so they can have this lemon back.  I will never buy a MiniVan again and never any Chrysler again!!"

The vehicle has perform wonderfully, we have had no issues with fit, trim, or initial build quality. Mileage has improved since it has been broken in, Highway 55-60 MPH around 25 mpg, Highway 65-70 mph around 23-24 mpg. City/Hwy around 18- 19 mpg. I read the reviews from car magazines of this minivan prior to buying you'd thought this vehicle to be a dog, not so, very comfortable, dependable, quite. Our last T&C got us 136,000 miles w/o any work other than routine maintenance. I expect the same here."

Like that kids can watch video & we can still listen to radio.  Nice that you can load music onto hard drive so you don't have to keep inserting CD's.  See no point in being able to load pictures as screen saver, wouldn't want family pics in car in case stolen, etc.  Should've gotten higher pkg with both power seats b/c passengar seat can't be lowered and it's set a bit high for me.  Easy to maneuver, V6 3.8 engine is a plus, pretty good ""take off"".  Wish climate controls were digital instead of old fashion turn knobs.  Stow N Go is excellent, gives us so much needed room.

I am impressed so far. Good job Chrysler. "
chrysler,town-and-country,2009,Paul Fritz, 05/25/2010,Really nice,5,"Drives well and with the 4.0 runs like a Greyhound chasing a rabbit.  The seats are nice and good for long trips.  Seat heaters are welcome in the past winter.  All the toys: power doors, lift gate, u- connect, backup camera, memory seats and pedals, etc all work as they are supposed to.  But let's talk hard plastic.  I took a 2011 Senna for a drive just for fun and guess what the top of the dash was: Hard plastic so this entire thing about hard plastic talk is just bunk.  I bought this after my 2007 was sold to a friend and she is still a friend so power up and lets go.  It seems the people who count, the owners, think more of the van than the pros so take our word for it: good product!"
chrysler,town-and-country,2009,SJ, 08/28/2010,Bad Brakes,3,"Overall, I've been a big fan of the T&C, but the brake quality on this vehicle is horrible.  Had to have the front brakes and rotors replaced twice already, once off the lot and again at 18k.  Now the back brakes and rotors need replaced at 20k.  Chrysler is helping with the front brakes, but so far not for the back. Love the van, but can't afford to replace the brakes every year..especially when the dealer quotes over $500."

It is the only true mini van still in the market and as such fills the segment perfectly. It is the first Chrysler we have ever owned and I am very impressed. We have owned one Ford and four GM mini vans and this is by far the best and most thought out product of the group. I sure would like to know what products the editor was comparing this with to give this vehicle a do not buy rating!

A few months after purchasing, I started having electrical issues!! Windshield wipers come on and off by themselves, all dash lights come on but all gauges stop working, radio stops working, no controls work (such as power windows, door, hatch, etc). even the dealer couldn't fix it!!! Now on top of that after having the recall fixed on the ignition, it isn't working correctly the car wont shut completely off and is draining the battery, the transmission slips, and I have to put power steering fluid in it every day!!!!!!!

chrysler,town-and-country,2009,Patrick, 02/17/2009,Excellent So Far,4,We looked at Honda's and T&C's and for the money you just can't beat a T&C. I went from a Maxima so it's a bit of an adjustment but so far I love it. I did however upgrade to the 4.0L and think it's probably worth it.
chrysler,town-and-country,2009,Kelly M1, 03/01/2009,Best van I ever had,5,We came out of a Toyota Sienna that had alot of engine problems.

The crossover vehicles, although more stylish, do not offer the verstility of a minivan, and get worse gas mileage with harsher ride. The Touring trim level was just right for us, we have no need for DVD player(s), leather, etc. "

It don't go back enough. when it goes back it also go down. then you can't see over the dashboard.The front part of the seat is always higher then your rear-  you feel like your sitting in a bucket.

The first thing you notice is the ride and great gas mileage.  I ordered the 4.0 with trailer-tow.  Nice strong pull with no lag or stutter.  Brakes are light with the right amount of feedback.  This 25th Anniversary comes with 17 inch wheels and tires which is a great plus. The first trip to the East Coast was pleasant and had no issues. With 636 miles showing, i was getting 23.5 mpg.

After trading in a 2003 Dodge Grand Caravan we had an idea of what to expect from a new Chryler, but we were pleasantly surprised. The new van has vastly improved entertainment options and interior quality.  My boys have had a lot of fun rotating the 2nd row seats to face backwards and challenge their brothers to video games on the third row video screen.  Meanwhile I have enjoyed listening to Sirius sattelite radio in the front without having to listen to the sounds of race cars and explosions from the rear. We had 138000 miles on our last van.

On the interior the features of the car such as the satellite radio make the long rides more enjoyable. The leather upholstery in the car gives it a comfortable feel and the layout in the car provides for communication between passengers without largely distracting the driver. Each of the two televisions mounted on the ceiling of the gray roof provide a distraction for kids, but I have found that they block the drivers view in the rearview mirror. "

The exterior is very nice and the interior is very luxurious. The seats are very comfortable, and adjust 8 ways for driver and passenger. I really like the rotary dials for the climate control and the center stack in general. The 2nd row Stow n Go seats are more comfortable than I would have thought,and the 3rd row is plenty roomy.    The 3.8L V6 is very powerful and the manual shift mode makes the van almost (almost) fun to drive. It has all the great attributes of 25 years of innovation in one luxurious machine. "

Didn't make it from dealership to driveway before quit on side of road and we ended up walking home.  Transmission problems at 4500 km's still not resolved at 14,0000 km's.  Chrysler told us to get lost in regards to repairs.  Overall extremely unhappy with the vehicle in terms of quality and chryslers refusal to stand by warranty.  Will be going to arbitration board for compensation"

Changed to Mobile 1 oil and mileage ranges 19 to 25 mpg with  adequate power when loaded heavily with seats stowed.  Now waiting in line with other owners for arrival of a backlogged improved air conditioner part to replace the original one that  fails too often.  Last year my air conditioner failed and the part was replaced by an identical part, the only available version.  This is my 6th Chrysler minivan.  It is homely to look at, but a dream to drive.  It gets up to speed quietly. The sliding door on the passenger side doesn't operate from inside.  Leg room isn't enough for the second-row seats unless front seats are moved forward more than I like."

Short and sweet: van is on 4th set (no lie) of rotors as of 34k miles. These were all replaced under warranty. The last visit (I have been to the dealer in the teens if not over 20 times now) the calipers, pads, and lines were also replaced. Now they squeak and both rear brakes have since had overheating problems. I will be back yet again. Also, both power doors broke, recalls, transmission jerks, engine misses. Good luck. Forget the VW version too. There is a brake issue and I bet you will see a recall down the road. Done let them make you pay for brakes!"

Good visibility, easy to drive, nice sound system, comfortable seating, stow&go is awesome! With rebates, etc., this was my best choice.

Now yesterday the A/C began to blow warm air. I wil never ever buy a Chrysler again. The worst car you can imagine. The driver window mulfunctioned. The wiper rotates when the turn signal is turned on (what the heck!). I might contact the company and ask for refund. Oh, by the way, the car is so noisy. Actually nosier than my 1994 Ford Fiesta.

The seats are really comfy and my daughter loves the DVD player. My husband seems to really like the satelite radio that comes free for a year, and we all love the rear view back up camera. The radio is very fancy with the ability to store songs on the internal hard drive. My screen saver is a picture of the family in Disney world. The doors are easy to open and close and the radio is easily viewed while driving and easy to navigate. I know I have not had the car for too long, but our experience so far has been nothing but positive. The car is quiet, love the stow and go seats!"
chrysler,town-and-country,2009,casey, 03/26/2009,Great Purchase,4,"The Chrysler has been an enjoyment to own, the vehicle handles great on the road as well as handling a growing family.

The kids love the fact that their windows now go down and that they can listen to ""Kids Stuff"" from Sirius satellite radio and watch a DVD at the same time.  In fact we can listen to three unique audio / visual sources simultaneously.  For any parent who has had to listen to Dora while driving you know how important that is.  We are leaving this week for a 1000 mile drive to Gulf Shores.  I expect this to be an enjoyable drive with our new Inferno Red Town & Country."

Averaging about 17 miles/gallon in first 1000 miles, using 89 Octane (recommended for 4.0).  Mostly mixed driving (Suburbs).  Good Engine layout, everything is easy to check."

I first test drove a used Mercedes E-class because we already own a Mercedes SUV which my husband loves and of course was pleased with the ride but when I asked the question whether our six member family was ready to have my husband's SUV be the largest vehicle in our household, answer came back a resounding NO.  Because have had such great experience with two previous T&C's (trade-in had 130,000+ miles) decided to check out new T&C and dealer incentives.  By the time all the incentives were added (including $3,500 for trade-in) my $37,000 minivan went down to $28,000 and well...the rest is history in the making!"

It replaced a 2008 Dodge GC, essentially the same vehicle.  Overall, pleasure to drive.  Handles well, almost what you'd call 'sporty'. Well-appointed, tightly assembled, nicely functional. Comfortable, though passenger space is compromised in the Stow/Go version, a center bench would accomodate one more adult. The trans needs refinement/domestication.  (See below.)"

My friends with Honda, Toyota, or Nissan, with equal minivan age, had to do one or more major repairs during the past 9 years. We never had any trouble with it and it has 100,000 miles. It was time to get a new one. After shopping around, we decided to stay with Chrysler. The 2009 touring is impressive in all aspects."

With incentives this vehicle is substantially less expensive than the Honda and Toyota competition that we choose to compare with. A similar Honda was over $5K more.  Note to Toyota - your stock tires supplied were horrible for winter driving.  Do you not know where the vehicles are being delivered to - hello.  Handling is a little sloppy but since we use it for highway not such a big deal.  Don't try to use this vehicle in the mountains.  On our first try, even though we used the shiftable auto transmission to slow the vehicle, the rotors warped after one trip.  The 4.0 liter motor is an improvement from our previous T & C - decent power and mpg."

chrysler,town-and-country,2010,owner18, 08/07/2014,Good Car but Chrysler should be ashamed of a few things,4,"Good car.
Gas mileage is not as good as advertised but the van is a heavy/big van.
Two things that are a joke that they are an issue.
First, the Y connection from the heater core is made out of plastic.
This apparently goes bad about 4 years/80k mile range.
It will crack and leak where the molded plastic comes together.
I fixed with a metal plumbing T connection, some connectors, and new heater hose for about $8.
This should be a recalled defect.

Also, there is a rattle that sounds like it's coming from the doors.
It's not.
It's coming from the brake lines.
I added 5/8"" rubber hose to help cushion the two lines from squeaking.
I replace these bad engineer designs for about $10."
chrysler,town-and-country,2010,schooby, 03/25/2013,Family owned van,4,"We bought this Van new in 2010 with the 4.0 V-6. The van has been very reliable. We achieve 26 MPG highway doing 70MPH on flat level road. In the rolling hills and mountains of Tennessee and Montana we made 22 MPG hwy. City driving averages 16-18MPG in Charleston SC. The van comfortably tows my boat weighting 3,500lbs. Climate control & DVD system work great. I recommend either full synthetic or synthetic blend oil changed at 4-5k intervals. Transmission shifts smooth and feels solid. The front wheel drive operates well in deep snow and slushy ice. This van has been driven to Arizona, Washington, Montana, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Florida without any problems. Money well spent. "
chrysler,town-and-country,2010,Carolyn, 08/20/2018,Electronic failure is expensive to fix,2,"I bought this van at 42,000 miles for its cargo space. It has a comfortable ride, great for hauling 8 people around town, and was a joy to own.. for the first year.  Then we had brake issues. Not the normal rotor & pad repair, but had to have the the front end rebuilt. Cost was about $800. On to year three.. same problem with back end , rebuilt the back end as well. Year 4, car is now worth $8000 according to my insurance adjustors. I hit a deer and did about 6K worth of damage. Got the car home from the repair shop, then my headlights started to fail. Then the engine started running rough . There is a electrical control unit ( i think its called the IVM) that has to be replaced; $1300. There also has been fluid leaking into parts of the engine and the spark plugs, so all that area (forgive me I dont remember the exact parts) has to be replaced. Another $1000. Within 3 months and 102000 miles this car has literally self destructed. Repair shop says the current problems are not related to the deer accident as they have had other vans come in with the same issue. So.. this is a KNOWN issue with Chrysler.  I owned one Chrysler minivan about 20 years ago and swore I would never purchase another... shame on me. I did not heed my instincts.

chrysler,town-and-country,2010,dawnco, 05/23/2011,Always wanted one,4,"I always admired the T&C whenever I rode in them and knew that whenever the need arose I would get one. 
From carting around fishing poles to wheelchair and long trips on the road (with an airbed in back)- it was the perfect solution for us. This van came with a Sirius sat. and the remaining warranty from the dealer. We don't use the 2/3rd row seats that often and don't
have room to store seats, so this worked perfect for our situation.
Van came with 23k miles and got it for 19.9k"
chrysler,town-and-country,2010,Brenda, 07/06/2016,Updated REVIEW-7/18/2017,2,"I have owned this van for 4 years.  About a year into owning the van the engine light would come on.  A day or two later it would go off.  As the years have gone on if the van idles too long the next time I go to start it it won't start.  Now it just decides when it wants to start.  It's a computer problem with a cost of over $1000.   Other friends that have this van have the exact same problem.  One fixed it and it still has the same issue.  I don't recommend this van at all!  I'm looking to get rid of this one and go back to a Chevy product.  ***UPDATE...Still will never purchase another Chrysler product.  It's to the point during the summer that I can't even run my A/C otherwise the van won't start. I've taken it to numerous mechanics and no one can seem to find the problem. I've contacted Chrysler and they can't seem to help either.  This van is nothing but a joke.  I'll have to keep it a few more years due to having teenagers now driving but as soon as I can get rid of it I WILL!!!  I'll go back to Chevy.  I just if you're looking for a van find a Chevy or Ford product!  *****UPDATE 7/18/2017- This van just kept getting worse.  I could drive it then would have to let it sit for atleast 45 minutes before it would restart.   Each mechanic told me something different including dealerships that ""could possibly"" be wrong with the van.   I decided that if I was going to for out hundreds to thousands of dollars I'd rather put that towards another vehicle.    So a month ago I traded my piece of crap chrysler van in for a Chevy Equinox in which I LOVE.  When people ask how I like the Equinox I say I LOVE it..it starts, I can run the A/C plus I have a fob that actually works!     I'll NEVER go back to a Chrysler product.

Seems they all run like this. 3.8 L runs much smoother. Then the engine light came on at 800 miles. Dealer said it's running lean, Chrysler is aware of it and is working on a fix. Not what I want to here when you drop $35k on a new vehicle. So far I am starting to regret buying a Chrysler. I hope it last since I keep my cars. I would not recommend buying this vehicle. Chrysler no longer returns my e-mails."
chrysler,town-and-country,2010,dseawell, 12/25/2010,Excellent Value,4,Having owned both Honda and Toyota vans in the last 4 years I believe that the Chrysler T&C is on par with both of them. Feature for feature the T&C surpasses both of them at a price that is thousands less. The ride and interior environment is very comfortable not sporty but this is a van. If the 2010 version of the T&C fixes many of the earlier years problems then this van will be in the family for a long time.

chrysler,town-and-country,2010,Ras A, 11/24/2018,"Electrical, Transmission and check Engine",3,"The good: Nice comfortable and great for the family. The bad: Electrical, Check engine due to sensors, ECM, Transmission ( NO dipstick) make sure to change the fluid in timely manner and check it out by qualified tech. Don't take it to a dealer to change your oil change. Most of them are C techs ( Mechanics are graded by level of experience as A, B or C, most techs are not even level C, lol) or don't know what they are doing. My oil pan plug stripped 3 times, because they rush. and you will end up paying for the whole oil pan assembly, because of someone else's fault. Mine was replaced 3 times at a dealer in 2 years, until I took it somewhere else and I found out the truth. Not all dealers or private shops are equal. I’m a review believer ( check out google n bing reviews online) but read their reviews and always seeks 2nd or third opinion. Lastly, never rush the service writer to get your car done fast, he/she will tell the mechanic to skip some work on your vehicle to get your car out to you in time, to be charged for services never done. Advice for all those who take their vehicles to dealer, get to know the mechanic there, it will save you time, money 💰 n headache. If you have an open mind and a good heart, you will come out a winner.

If your on a road trip on the highway don't expect to hold a conversation from back seat to front seat with out yelling. no engine problems but don't have to much to back it.. transmission stinks, poor shifting either to late or jerks in to gear. seats are like sitting on a milk crate with plywood bolted to it. front seat leg room is a joke. I'm only 5' 9"" and I need to have the seat the all the way back and my legs don't rest on the seat. the rear seats are even worse for adults not tall enough and head rest in bad location. folding seats in to the floor is a great feature. no more dropping a nut for throwing your back out lifting and moving the seats and finding somewhere to store them. over all, I am NOT buying another one in the future. sad to say having the Chrysler badge on the front does not mean luxury. it means quickly and cheaply made. if it wasn't for the room I would have sold this darn thing about a week after buying it.

Rotated every other oil change.  Never thought about needing tires and thought funny never mentioned during their multi point inspection at oil changes.

And the stereo sometimes doesn't even come on. Engine has started missing and even tries dying after morning start.  Have had more trouble with battery cable hot clamp. We are on our 3rd.

The ride is starting to get rough. The transmission is starting to shift a lot less smoothly. And the gas mileage for in town has gone down the tubes. But all-in-all, I am happy that I have had the opportunity to drive this vehicle. I just fret that it will not make the 250,000 miles my Chevy Venture did. I am beginning to see lights burning out, and engine parts being replaced left and right. So far, my extended warranty has saved me thousands..oh my. I think that it is time to trade.

chrysler,town-and-country,2010,Patricia W., 06/04/2018,Comfortable ride with lots of room,5,"We actually got this Van with a strait trade for the car we had. The value was about the same. We also got new tires on the van in the trade because the car we had just   got tires. Everyone was happy. Mom then went on a 1000 mile trip to TX. The van currently has about 217000. It has been very dependable. The only real issues have been the lining around the door  in the back has pealed on the right side and the left is just starting. This is causing wind noise to come in. Also the switch for the driver window broke. You can't just get a switch you have to replace the entire unit. Still looking for a good price. It's around $120-185.  The tire gauge sensor is messing up. Told normal issue.  Has a small oil leak we need to fix. Keeping a eye on it. This is a daily driver about 80 miles a day.  I love the radio fetchers. I use a aux cable with my phone and spotify. I really like all the storage. i have the seats up even though I have no one traveling with me. I love the floor storage that you can hide stuff and no one can see it. Its very big. Lots of room in the back to hold groceries and other stuff securely. I also, at my seat on the floor, have a molded storage spot to hold a umbrella. They think of everything! The driver and passenger seats have these two hooks that I just realized could hang a bag from easily and use as a garbage bag. I was just looking for some kind of van garbage bag, saved me $20.   Very dependable van. would take on a trip any time!

Update
Have had it 6 months. Still driving it every day. Works fine. Just found a small coolant leak. Good gas milage.  Also found can use the USB port on the radio to plug my phone charger. No adaptor needed. Charges phone while driving and listening to Spotify. I haven’t used my  storage in the radio yet but plan to. Dependable driver. Would go on a trip in.

chrysler,town-and-country,2010,Lousy , 08/13/2010,No dealer help,3,"Cruise control is not consistent. Same downgrade, one time shifts to 4th and maintains speed, next time shifts to 3rd and engine revs to 5500 rpm clear to bottom of hill. Trans does not shift as smooth as when new (4500 mi.) dealer says it works perfect, according to their computer readout. This van also would go to idle driving down road. Had to be towed in twice. New accelerator solved problem. Scary at best. District managers advise do not use Cruise control on downgrades (brilliant duh-h-h) I've driven Chrysler products since 1953, this is the last one. Engineering is really missing in these new vehicles. You will get no help by going to their help line. You bought it you own it, tough! Goodbye Chrysler."

I bought a Town & Country because I refused to buy a foreign car. I was hesitant because of the reviews, however this is the best vehicle I have owned in a long time. The interior is great, nice soft leather and is comfy on long trips. I got 25 mpg average highway with a high of 27 on 2 separate trips. I traded in a 09 GMC Acadia, lousy mileage and tough to get in and out of."
chrysler,town-and-country,2010,jeff, 10/19/2010,Annoying alignment,3,Ever since my test ride the vehicle has had a tendency to drift to the right. It has been in the shop 5 times in the last 10 months to try to correct the drifting. The last effort the dealer made was to remove the factory struts and install new ones that allow more adjustment. It is better with these but there is still a noticeable steering imbalance. The head man at the dealer said that the 2008-2010 models are extremely tight. any variance in the alignment and the vehicle wont drive straight. Its annoying to drive around in a new vehicle and always having to steer it defensively! Test drive your vehicle first before you sign on the dotted line.
chrysler,town-and-country,2010,ocramidajzj, 09/07/2010,Great ideas poorly executed.,2,"My family and I just took a Town and Country on a 1,000 mile round trip to Baltimore and back. Despite having some very clever features (stow and go seats for example) the engine (3.8 liter V6) and transmission along with the interior build quality was horrible. Chassis dynamics were horrible too; delivering a vomit inducing ride over highways which when coupled with the transmission and engine's lurching motions caused my son to get sick three times over a few hundred miles. Hope Fiat can turn Chrysler around becasue the basic ideas are excellent, but the overall execution is beyond poor. This sample only had 5K on it."

So far the parts we have changed are the battery and terminal connections, pads and rotors all around,  starter, power steering hose, axle seal, the main computer in the van, and the solenoid pack for the transmission has been replaced twice. This van will not go up my driveway in reverse without feeling like somethings gonna break. It starts when it wants to, or it just clicks like you have a dead battery. You can start it with remote start and when you put the key in and turn it, it shuts down. The dealership just had this thing for 8 days and still can't figure anything out because they cannot duplicate the problem and it shows no codes in the computer. So pretty much you will just throw parts into until they figure it out. I was driving along about 60mph when it downshifted to 3rd gear and the engine light came on and it was stuck not going above 3rd gear, had to have it towed and rent a car on my own dime.

Test drove/read reviews on Toyota Sienna and Honda, but decided on T&C.  First, price was going to be at least $5k less than comparables, and the T&C actually is more loaded than even these comparable competitors, and most of these features are standard on Touring Plus.(I drive an Acura MDX, so I know about luxury options.) TV screens in both 2nd and 3rd rows is awesome, and love that they can watch same DVD or 2 different DVDs at the same time. T&C has also figured out that regardless of the color of the leather seats, the floor carpet should be black. Didn't want the ""Blind Spot Assist"" option, but now wouldn't go without it."

1. The sliding door could remain open and I can lock it with my remote. Seems kinda dumb to be able to lock the locks with either of the sliding door open. Seems like an oversight in design.
2. All 4 rotors worned out and warped. Chrysler is willing to pay part of replacement cost. Seriously, this is a manufacturer material issue. So far 3 other people I know have similar problem with 2009 and 2010.
3. Transmission shifts very hard between 1 to 3 and downwards too. Other similar year van does not have as pronounced shift as my van, but dealer claims it is normal and expected. Since computer shows no code, hence no issue.

The Odyssey always had a noisy interior and felt very ""airy"" when driving. All of the vans we test drove had very nice interiors with lots of luxury features....the T&C just seemed to stand out a little bit more.

With 1600 miles, it has been sent to dealers twice. The first visit is at 600 miles, the minivan gave rattle noise over bumpy roads. The dealer checked the vehicle for two hours and found that the emergency parking cable was not installed securely during assembly and was loose. Other problems we have: 1) it gives crunch noise before the minivan completely stops after braking; and 2) the slider windows (glass) rattle over bumpy roads when opened part way because the gaps are too big. The dealer thinks that is normal. So I have to bear with those annoying noises."

So far I have around 600 miles put on it.  I drive pretty conservatively in a suburb area with not a lot of stop and go traffic.  Very disappointed that I average 15.5 mpg.

You feel the road without sacrificing a smooth ride. I've heard the complaints about the build quality and reliability. Our dealer threw in a lifetime warranty (for our lifetime - not the vehicle's lifetime) from Daimler. It is normally $3k. It covers windshield, interior and exterior components, engine, rental car, electrical and tires with no pro ration for wear. The only thing we pay for are maintenance items like oil changes, filers and brake pads.  I figure that despite the reliability issues, I'm covered for as long as I own this vehicle.

chrysler,town-and-country,2010,Jim, 03/04/2010,Review,4,My wife and I purchased a Town and Country Limited and we both love it. It drives great and it is very functional having 3 children. We needed a vehicle with more space and easy for the kids to get in and out of and our SUV just didn't have the room (or MPG) we were looking for and no crossover that we looked at could match the space and comfort of a minivan. We read the articles that talked about the quality of the interior but I love how it is designed and looks. We also tested a 2009 Nissan Quest and 2011 Toyota Sienna and feel the Town and Country is much nicer and has more features for the price.

This is the third production year of 5th gen T&C, so quality is vastly improved. 4.0L V6 is outstanding. Wonderful sounding stereo system (9 amplified speakers w/subwoofer). At 4500 pounds, this vehicle feels very solid and safe. Quite impressive. This is our 4th Chrysler minivan since 1990 and, by far, the best."

Arrigo Dodge was extremely helpful in picking out the right model.  Plenty of inventory on hand to choose from.  The engineering in this vehicle is evident the moment you get in.  The controls are well integrated, the ergonomics are superior, and the van as a whole just is flat out better for our needs than   the other offerings.

chrysler,town-and-country,2010,Langzaam, 04/12/2010,Excellent buy,4,"After two months searching we decided on the T&C Ltd. It started out wanting a SUV that could seat 7 or 8. We tried and driven many to always conclude that space comes at a premium with an SUV. To name a few such as the Journey, CX9, Veracruz, Pilot, Odyssey, sienna,Outlander,MKT,etc. No, a minivan was not the thing to do except when looking at it, it always had plenty of space. A showroom model of the T&C eventually convinced us that features with the options of Luxury made the decision. Stow and Go, power folding back seat, power doors and powered hatch, two Indep. video displays was the ticket for us. The real winner was a very acceptable price. Objections by other consumers were frivolous."

So, this is our third Chrysler/Dodge minivan since 1992, and the best yet. We have three children who come fully equipped with friends, pets, etc., and as they are learning to drive we wanted a safe easy-to-drive ride for them to learn on. The stellar safety record outshone others, especially Toyota, which was far more expensive for a less capable vehicle.

We settled on the Town and Country and we couldn't be more pleased. The gas mileage is amazing, stow and go is a god send with kids and the way we were treated by the dealership was amazing.

With respect to the interior, as an engineer, I prefer hard plastics (what others have called cheap) to soft plastics for their resilience and material strength and otherwise the interior is superbly finished.  At first blush, this van is great, and a great value.  This of course may change as time goes on, and I may modify this review in the future."

We just drove it 1200 miles and it rides and handles very well. I was afraid it would feel too big but now I jump in and drive it everywhere.  I never thought we would own a minivan but now I don't think we'll ever be without one.  I love all the electronics.

Trying desperately to avoid becoming a ""minivan family,"" yet find a semi-economic solution, we even tried the smaller SUVs with the tini-wini, worthless 3rd row seats. After all that waisted time and effort, we finally brought ourselves to just ""look"" at some minivans. Opening the doors for the first time on our Town & Country Limited was as if the clouds in the sky separated and Heavenly, magical rays of light shown through.

Overall I love this thing!  the engine is POWERFUL and has lots of good low end torque.  I put a class 3 receiver on and I can tow 3500lbs with NO STRAIN.  MPGs are terrific.  Around town, when using ECON mode, I can get 20-22MPG.  On the interstate, I can average 29MPG.  If I use cruise control, and keep my speed to around 55MPH on the interstate, I can get 36MPG!!!  Stow and go is a game changer.  Frankly, it is the main reason I didn't go with Toyota or Honda.  Within about 2min, I can transform my 7 passenger family hauler into a cargo van, or any stage in between.  The backup camera is amazing and the stereo may be the best non-premium option stereo I have ever seen as an OEM build.  FCA really thought things thru with this design.  Starting in 2011, the internal redesign is gorgeous.  The previous version of this generation has an interior that reminded me of a 1986 LeBaron.  My 2 kids have plenty of space in the middle row captains chairs, but could have used some better cup holder options, as the only ones actually made for that row are at the bottom of the sliding doors, and cant be reached by small kids in car seats.  As for cup holders, there are 6 available up front (not including the doors)!  Plenty of storage (especially with stow-n-go).  Also the interior has green light bars in the ceiling that spread a nice glow at night that makes it far more comfortable for small kids who get scared in the dark.  Handling is great.  I only with it had a AWD option for winter weather.  If you take ECON mode off, this thing has some guts to it, and is at home doing 80MPH.  Acceleration is really good for a heavy van, too.  I personally think that this vehicle may be the best value available in America today due to its price, features, performance and versatility.

Advised by dealer to take out of economy mode when accelerating/merging onto highway. It helped.

Very comfortable, plenty of room. We bought Touring 'base' model. Wished we had gone for some of the 'bells and whistles' - DVD, etc...

My last few vehicles have been SUVs...this is so much more comfortable."

Many things we like about this compared to our old pre-stow and go T&C.
Miss a few things too, like the flat folding rear seats.
Low end torque of the 3.6 L Pentastar is awsome. Seats are better than the 2010 models we test drove.
 Hiway mileage seems a bit better than our old 3.8 L, but city is probably about the same due to the heavier weight of the vechicle.
With 7 adult passengers, we were getting 25-26 mpg on our first road trip on winter gas in MN. "

I've had my 2011 Limited for 2 weeks, and I love it!
It has all the bells and whistles both the Toyota and Honda offer, but I didn't have to pay thousands for the extras.
The price to value ratio was astounding! I looked at the Odyssey and Sienna first, was gonna buy the Sienna, but I just couldn't finish the deal.
The Chrysler is more attractive, more comfortable, a better drive, a much better value, has a better warranty, and, I must say, gives me more peace of mind than the Toyota, for sure. Do yourself a favor and check out the Town and Country before you buy, you'll be glad you did.

The 2011 on the inside is by far the nicest one yet. Last generation 08-10 was the worst I've had. Cheap look/feel to the interior and worst drivabilities. Too much roll in turns but this new one beats them all since 99. look and feel of the interior definately the highest quality and nicest design yet. IMO you can even argue it's nicer than the Sienna or Odessy I looked into. Only drove about 300 mi's but seems so far to be much improved over last generation in terms of road handling but it remains to be seen how this new powertrane and redesigned suspensions stand the tests of time"

At around 20k miles we noticed that the vehicle would shudder and the steering wheel would shake when applying the brakes. It seemed to be worse when going down hill. Initially we thought it was the anti-lock brake system, but it became much worse over time.
Took it into the dealer and they said all 4 rotors were warped and need to be replaced at $800+. When I asked if they would cover under warranty they denied me. Took the vehicle to another shop and they noticed the chrome on the rims was burnt off from excessive heat. Also said the calipers are locking up.

I still have warranty on it and i'm sure it will be covered 100% on hard parts meaning i have to pay at least 300 in soft parts ie oil, gaskets etc. I love the van and i'm hoping to keep it for a long time to come after i get the transmission fix.

chrysler,town-and-country,2012,Jay Strongbow, 09/21/2015,Be forewarned: You'll be @ dealer every month,1,"The engineering on this car is amazingly poor.   They threw features on the car so they could include them in the brochure, but the engineering / fabrication of the car is so substandard that you'll have this car in the shop every month.

- the check engine light will come on and stay on, and the dealer will bang you for 100+ dollars every time you take it in.   For all the 'sophistication' of this vehicle, it cannot show you the interpretation of the check-engine codes.  Don't forget to add the 100+ dollars every month, plus your time, plus the non-use of the vehicle into the cost of the car.   
- car sometimes will not start (chip malfunction) ... be prepared to have it towed every so often.   And don't take it on a trip ... it's not trustworthy.
- the blind spot warning system pings continuously for no reason.  You can have the blind-spot detection turned off, but then why did they include such an untested system in this vehicle.  Wasted dollars on purchasing this extra feature and on the many, many, many, many times we had this seemingly repaired only to have it malfunction a week after getting it back.  Painful.  Absolutely painful.
- there have been a HUGE number of recalls, many of which involve safety features

If you are a lonely person and want to count the service people amongyour closest friends, by all means purchase this vehicle.

If you are a thrill-seeker and want to drive a car which could lose power at any moment while you are driving in heavy traffic, by all means purchase this vehicle.

If you have extra money and time and you enjoy paying top dollar for a substandard vehicle, by all means purchase this vehicle.

Frequently pull an almost  4000 lb boat package from Phoenix to San Diego , etc.  On very steep hills I can't get over 50 mph and gas mileage drops but don't have many places like that.  Some slight wind noise lately.  Was going to silicone the door/window gaskets.  Can't use the GPS when it's moving but use cell phone instead or stop to set it.  Love the Stow & Go seats and all the luggage capacity it creates.  Have been worried that I may be overloading it with boat towing but so far no problems.  Get some boat sway unless I keep the tongue weight up.  Looking at newer Pacifica but not sure it's worth upgrading yet. Last Town & Country I had was  wrecked by an idiot driver hitting me.

chrysler,town-and-country,2012,Mountain Mama, 11/22/2015,Safe comfortable car for the family!,5,"With some kicking and screaming I traded my 4wheel drive jeep in for a used 2012 minivan. Dollar for dollar, after much research, we found the Chrysler T&C to be the best value. Great interior, comfortable leather seats, wonderful Bluetooth and hands free system. Love the stow and go options for my 2 growing boys and 4 golden retrievers. Every time I miss my sporty 4x4 days, this mom is pleasantly surprised and reminded why we changed to a minivan. What a secret we minivan mamas have over the rest of those moms driving around in little cars stuffed with everything. And the safety ratings are great which are reflected in the insurance premium. We are an active family and I was able to stow and configure the seats to fit an adult kayak, kid's kayak, and kid's paddle board in the van WITH my boys, a cooler, beach chairs, and life jackets this summer regularly. Winter months have us piling our ski gear in the back and heading to the mountain. How nice it is to have so much room to work with! We bought this van with 36k miles on it, it now has 79k miles and the only maintenance (other than oil changes and tire rotations) is brake pads and a transmission issue that was under warranty. This is our choice for long distance driving, and we've seen 30mpg on those trips (2000 mile round trips). Now, Chrysler seems to be putting cheap parts in brake systems and u-joints, but we've only had to replace brake pads once in the 40k+ we've put on this van. Not so lucky on our Dodge Durango (u-joints, brake pads and rotors) or former Jeep Patriot (electrical issues that left me stranded several times) so I would expect that you could see these issues on any Chrysler once it reaches a certain age or mileage. All in All one of the only cars I would give a great review for. Fits a family's needs very well!
*Update 6/02/16 At about 78,000 I started having a loud noise from the engine when I would accelerate. Took it in and they discovered that part of the transmission had actually cracked and come apart (the fly wheel?). After 3 weeks at the dealership and a tiny rental car, I finally got it back. Was happy to have the van back but began to question what other problems were ahead of me if this was just at 78k miles. The head mechanic said he had never seen anything like it in the 30yrs he's been there. Because I had traded in a Jeep Patriot at just over 100k miles because of several electrical issues (including a small fire) I decided maybe Chrysler cars are not my best choice for reliability after all of this. I no longer have the van but really miss the space and stow and go seats!

chrysler,town-and-country,2012,Mike Angelo, 09/30/2017,Best car I've owned in many years,5,"Have over 75,000 miles.  Towed a 2500 lb camper through 15 states and Canada with no problems.  Besides tires & oil change, haven't spent a dime on repairs.  Get great gas mileage .  Frequently pull an almost  4000 lb boat package from Phoenix to San Diego , etc.  On very steep hills I can't get over 50 mph and gas mileage drops but don't have many places like that.  Some slight wind noise lately.  Was going to silicone the door/window gaskets.  Can't use the GPS when it's moving but use cell phone instead or stop to set it.  Love the Stow & Go seats and all the luggage capacity it creates.  Have been worried that I may be overloading it with boat towing but so far no problems.  Get some boat sway unless I keep the tongue weight up.  Looking at newer Pacifica but not sure it's worth upgrading yet. Last Town & Country I had was  wrecked by an idiot driver hitting me. It had over 150,000  miles with no major problems.

Took it to the dealer and where i bought it was told that was ""normal"". Transmission cooler lines blew out on us at 75k and now the flywheel is cracked at 90k when googled it looks like this is a common problem. The rear brakes stick from time to time another common problem. In the first year we are at close to 1500 in repairs. Also the van claims it gets 26mpg but when i did the math its closer to 20 i love the stow and go and the looks of the van if i could go back in time i would not buy this van i still have 2 years of payments and can only hope it makes it before the tranny drops out.

quality to be way above average. I have owned a Honda Van in the past and find that even though it was a good vehicle, the T&C is way ahead in overall quality and gas mileage."

chrysler,town-and-country,2012,Leon C., 03/27/2018,Fun piece of Machinery,5,"I am the second owner of this 2012 T&C. I bought it with 118500 miles on it. It was in good shape but needed some TLC. The engine was misfiring on the #2 and #6 cylinder. Turns out that the head was defective from the manufacturer. They extended the warranty on that part to 150000 miles and since have replaced the head, no longer having misfire issues. The 3.6 Pentastar motor is a powerhouse except when turning right or left like when entering a freeway or taking off from not a quite complete stop like when the red light changes to green just before you stop. The engine idles rough and I will have that looked at. The transmission was shifting poorly due to the fact the previous owner never did a service on it. I had the trans serviced and it is working better but still takes awhile to shift down from the passing gear. I drive for a Rideshare Co. and put 350 miles on it a day, 5 days a week. Gas mileage couldn't be better at about 23 mpg in the city. I get great comments from my passengers about the seats being comfortable and the amount of leg room they have. Everyone loves to watch Anchorman on the DVD player. they think the electric sliding doors are cool too. Over all, this is my vehicle. It is in very good shape. Your vehicle may operate differently and have other issues. Any car purchased will have issues but for families this car is absolutely reliable as long as it is maintained.

Ended up with sirens in addition to those whistles.  Faulty door switch caused the car to go up in flames when it was a year old. Chrysler tried to do everything they could to shift blame but ended up doing a recall on all the Town and Countrys. They had a poorly designed switch. Next came the cylinder and another recall. At least the fire department did not have to be called this time. Not the van is going on six years old and there is a drive train issue... the drive train warranty is good for five. Overall quality of the car is poor. The appearance and features were very nice and it is what my wife wanted but now she is driving a new car and I am stuck driving the van until I get something else. Since then the transmission flex plate needed replaced and the car has under a hundred thousand miles. Shocking a major car company produced such a piece of unreliable garbage

The one negitive I have is the GPS/intertainment system.

Although it works as promised, it is difficult to use and almost impossible to operated while driving. I never do because it takes away too much of my attention, TOO dangerous.

They have all the bells and whistles now. They might not be as stylish or ""cool looking"" on the exterior as many SUV's, but if you're older than 16, you can probably live with it. The critics should emphasize the truth about the T&C and Caravan; there is no other family vehicle with more versatility. The stow 'n' go feature is second to none! How nice is it to be able to go from a 7-passenger van to a large cargo van in just minutes? Guess! Ever heard of a van that's actually fun to drive and has a great ride? They make them now!"

Between 15-20 mph it makes an irritating noise that Chrysler has no fix for.
They basically say it is driveable so I have to live with it.
The dealership has found that this is common with other new vans on their lot.
This noise is persistent and louder than when we first noticed it (7200 miles now).
No repair, no replacement, nothing but a continual noise.

We compared the Honda Odyssey, Toyota Sienna, and the T&C.
We loved the ride of the Honda, the 2nd row leg room of the Toyota, but the likes really stopped there for anything outside the T&C.
Options on the T&C are more plentiful for less money (rear entertainment, nav, heated seats...).
Of note, the T&C is the ONLY one to offer remote start.
The DVD in the Sienna looked like a shotty 3rd-party install, while both the Odyssey and Sienna dashboards felt very poorly and/or cheaply designed. 

UPDATE 6/2016
So 40k miles in, still no real issues.  Complaints are still road noise and rougher ride (could be OEM hard tires however).  Fuel mileage isn't the best around town, but good power is a trade off.  Have an issue where the nav won't update, paid (yes paid, no free map updates) $150 for an update and the unit would 't accept it, Garmin couldn't figure it out and actually said to have the head unit replaced so they can inspect.  Still haven't had the time to do that so no word on how it worked out.  Bought an inexpensive HDMI media player that I could plug into the rear 110V power and use an IR extender so I can load a bunch of our movies I put on an SD card, so we don't have to mess with changing DVD's and Disney super long menu intros - so we love the media connectivity!  It'd be nice to be able to directly load movies to the HDD, but I'm sure that's to come.  Transmission: haven't had problems other than when using Econ mode.  Then the reverse to drive and vice versa are delayed and very hard.  Coupled with the very low 3-4 (I think) gear shift RPM and no torque, we usually don't use Econ and it's fine - use it for road trips and we get 1.5-2 mpg higher and don't worry about the low speed shifting so win-win there!  Stow-N-Go has been great, lots of extra storage on trips if the mid row is up, and rear seats can be configured for nice holding spots or jump seats, whatever way we want.    All-in-all very happy!

chrysler,town-and-country,2013,Floyd Sense, 07/21/2016,Run away from the Navigation System,3,"These are facts, not my opinions.  When the car is new, the nav system (Garmin design) is super.  It doesn't have voice command function, but otherwise is very good.  Eventually, you'll want to update the maps and point-of-interest information with the latest.  Chrysler does not sell the updates, you have to go to the source - Navteq (now known as ""HERE"") and purchase the update for $149 (there is no lifetime update option).  That's the same for most nav system updates today, regardless of make and model of your car.  For all other makes and models, you just order the update at the Navteq website and they send you a DVD or other media and you apply the update yourself.  But, for the 2013 Town and Country equipped with the 430N radio with a code of RBZ (found on lower right hand corner of the radio faceplate), you are forced to go through a strange procedure where you insert a  USB drive into the front of the radio, initiate some commands via the radio menu and then the radio is supposed to write info about the navigation package to the USB drive.  You then plug that USB drive into your PC and the website analyzes the information (looking for what, is undocumented) and decides whether you need the update.  The problem is, many of the radios do not write the info to the USB drive due to some quirk in the radio software.  I had the dealer update the radio software to the latest level, but that made no difference at all.  Many calls to Navteq and a Chrysler support line got me nowhere.  Navteq says that the problem has been reported by many other owners and they sent reports to Chrysler, but with no response.  When I raise the issue with Chrysler, they again tell me that they don't sell map updates.  For the price of an update ($149), you can purchase a stand-alone unit from Garmin with lifetime free map and POI updates and not have to deal with Chrysler at all.

Where the Sienna's went down in quality from our observations, the T&C is really good so far - not all the incessant rattles that plagued the last Toyota.
The ride is much more comfortable and not floaty like some soft rides can be - they really got it right.
The interior is fantastic - really nicely done and really well equipped - a lesser Toyota or Honda costs much more.
This is also a great MV to drive - great visibility, refined ride and well controlled noise, great car-like (for a MV) driving position.

The blower just squeaked by in the warranty period, by about two months.  But the power sliding door latch will cost me $1143.32 including labor.

chrysler,town-and-country,2013,Anonymous, 08/17/2015,Quietly sits in the sidelines,5,"Update- After owning the 2013 T&C for a few years it became more clear that the transmission is just not that great.  I never seems to know what to do, or how to do it right.  Its been updated with the most recent transmission flash but still doesn't shift very good.  Around town it does OK, but the deceleration feature when you let off the throttle is annoying, and while on the freeway and climbing slight uphill grades or easily increasing the speed, instead of smoothly engaging into a lower range or unlocking the TC to offer some pep it will instead violently throw itself into a lower gear which jumps the RPM's way up and bumping up the speed too quickly.  Then because you're going too fast, it shifts back into OD and repeats the overly aggressive act at the slightest touch of the pedal.  VERY annoying...  But, if you turn on the ""Eco"" button then it will hold the OD gear much much longer throughout the throttle for a more pleasant less shifting experience.  Although driving in Eco mode in town is horrible because the torque management is obnoxious when the transmission is clearly skipping gears to be more economical giving a weird feeling like there's a flat spot in the throttle.  Strict emission requirements creates these problems too.
All in all the van is enjoyable but the transmission is definitely the design problem of this vehicle...

Some were really stylish.  The Mustang was a 289 loaded poppy red convertible.  My 2013 Town and Country beats them all.  It may not be the most stylish, but definitely the most versatile, comfortable, stable, quiet and has lots of quality.  We took 2 trips from Arizona to the Northwest, about 3000 miles each time.  I didn't go past the speed limit, and got an overall 30MPG on both trips.  In town mileage isn't great, but most of my driving is highway.   We bought it new, and now has close to 95,000 miles.  I can't recall any repairs I had to pay for outside of maintenance.  There were some minor warranty issues.  It doesn't rattle, and the leather interior looks like new.  Honestly, this car has held up better than our 2006 4Runner that we bought new. (4Runner also a great car - 2nd best!).  You can buy these Chryslers dirt cheap. I just pretend I'm driving my old Imperial.  The Town and Country has 283 horsepower, the same as a 57 Chevy with Fuel Injection.  I love this Town and Country and may soon replace it with a Pacifica.  Get past the stereotype soccer mom minivan, and appreciate these vehicles for all they can do.  If that doesn't work, just imagine you are driving a luxury vehicle from a couple of decades past, but with the latest innovations, such as satellite radio, navigation, etc.  And tell yourself how smart you are for not succumbing to peer pressure and advertising.

I live in Colorado and of course went to the mountains last weekend, scariest ride of my life. had my wife, daughter and two grandchildren in the car, going down a steep grade when I pressed on the brakes the car shook like it was going to break in too, more times I put on the brakes the more it shook. checking with brake specialist later it appears the front rotors
don't dissipate heat as fast as they should, appears Chrysler didn't put in higher grade rotors in case you every went on steep mountain roads, saved many millions but hoped nobody would have a bad situation like I did, wont ever buy another Chrysler product."
chrysler,town-and-country,2013,Nisha, 01/28/2017,Great family vehicle!,4,"I have no complaints about my 2013 Chyrsler Town and Country outside of speed of acceleration. I traded a Jeep Cherokee in for the Town and Country to fit my growing family of 6. The power of acceleration is much different but it is a different vehicle type. Not sure if this is with all types of Chyrsler Town and Country but I would love to have that powerful Jeep engine in a Town and Country package. 4 stars is only because there is no 4.5 star option.

chrysler,town-and-country,2013,F. Lattimore, 02/09/2017,Don't buy it,2,"I had a 2007 Chrysler Mini Van that was running fine with few to No issues. Gave it to my son and we bought a 2013 loaded Chyrsler T/C with 50K miles. Bad decision. The van is lighter so it bobs over the bumps up and down and has a tweaky bouncing ride up front.  Then tranmission lines leaked and could not be tightened to they had to be replaced at 70K.  The 6 speed transmission always wants to jump up to the next gear with the lightest touch on the gas. I am always shifting it down and holding it in that gear so it won't keep upshifting. The battery died at 60K. One key fob died. The computer board died so every electronic device in the car plus the wipers and AC was on and off hundreds of times per day until we got it to the dealer. That fix cost $700.                                                           So this was our 3rd Chrysler Mini Van and definitely our last.

chrysler,town-and-country,2013,Rodger, 02/11/2017,Excellent Minivan,5,"There was only one problem.  The very back right seat would lock in the stowed position.  It took three tries to get it right. A small spring was the culprit.  Fuel mileage drops to 17 mpg for short trips for groceries in the dead of winter in MN. It is usually 24-28 for road trips.  The power is adequate and the transmission is flawless.  Stability is surprisingly good.  This is my third Chrysler minivan.  I preferred the size of the smaller previous model.  My next van will be a little smaller.

chrysler,town-and-country,2013,archguy69, 04/24/2015,Steer Way Clear of This Lemon,2,"I thought I'd do some poor worker in Detroit a favor by buying American.  I convinced my very skeptical wife that a brand new 2013 T&C had to be decent automobile and that we'd be saving several thousand dollars by not buying Japanese.  I cannot tell you how much I regret this.  This vehicle is an absolute lemon.  The transmission is worse than anything I've every driven, it clunks into drive & slingshots forward with the slightest acceleration.  Chrysler is well aware of the issues, but refuses to fix.  The low tire pressure light will not turn off even though  nothing is wrong and the dash board's developed quite a rattle.  Dealer wants to charge a hefty diagnostic fee to remedy.  Update:  Was driving car with children to dance recital when van somehow goes into low power mode.  Low power mode means it only runs about 10 miles per hour and has no acceleration.  Luckily we were in the right lane of a very busy/fast road and were able to pull over and call for tow truck.  I had to force it into park at which time it made a huge banging noise.  Dealer finally took a real look at it after having it towed to them.  Chrysler finally did something and agreed to replace the transmission controller and the problems seemed to go away, but I was thoroughly fed up with it by this time.  Finally sold it to a dealer for $16,500 and bought a slightly used Japanese minivan from one of the leading manufacturers.  By the way, nobody wants to buy a used T&C for anywhere near Kelly blue book value.

chrysler,town-and-country,2013,Metalfablv, 07/15/2020,Put over 140K on this Van,4,"Bought a used 2013 TC with a little over 30k on it.  Had for it 6 years and put over 140k on the Van.  Have 4 kids and went on many of trips.  Here are the good, bad and ugly with this Van.  

Good--Great premium options compared to Honda/Toyota for the price.  A lot of space for long road trips, even have stow and go space if not using.  Never once was left on the side of the road or broke down while driving.  Decent gas mileage on highway. Low maintenance cost over the life of the vehicle until the last stretch. Very easy to work on if you are mechanically inclined.

Bad--Had replaced the struts and shocks twice due to rough ride (once under warranty) and it never seem to ride better, even though they state it is a luxurious ride.  Replaced alternator around 120k, replaced thermostat at 130k, broke a coolant line at 140k, at 145k it started to get the Chrysler Tick (goggle search) bad rocker arm on left cylinder head.  A/C wasn't working correctly around 155K, charged and would blow cold in front but Hot in rear.  

Ugly--The Rocker arm issues was the left cylinder head going out and was starting to have misfire and running rough issues.  Replaced all parts and new plugs, cleaned throttle body and still didn't run like it use too.  Decided to trade it in due to these issues, or would of still owned it.  Overall decent car that didn't cost too much until later in it's life span, but to me they don't make em like they used to.  I have seen and heard others that have this issue before our did, so consider ourselves decently lucky.

chrysler,town-and-country,2014,gavrik, 08/05/2014,This one is best yet,5,"I switched from '13 to '14 model for several reasons below: added blind spot monitoring, heated seats, remote starter in harsh winters.

This car absolutely rocks. First thing I noticed the steering is now more precise and firm. A rearview camera has obviously been improved as images look much crispier.

For me, the biggest complaint for the '13 model was a late shift from 3rd to 4th gear and back while in stop and go traffic which felt like a delayed acceleration. I drove several of these having the same issue. This is no longer the case, so obviously the engineers have made software adjustments and it now drives perfect."

I love it both inside and out.  It's silver color and sleek new design is very eye-catching for a soccer mom.  The inside features are great for me - a mom with 3 small kids.  There are 14 cup holders, a DVD player, Satellite radio, great surround sound system, plenty of lighting, so much room (I love the stow and go feature where the middle and back seats go down under the floor).

chrysler,town-and-country,2014,duraflex, 06/30/2014,Best MiniVan out there,5,"Drove the Odyssey, Sienna and Quest.
The Chrysler T&C is the best of the bunch and the best value available. 

We had been looking for a while and finally narrowed it down to the Nissan Quest and Chrysler T&C.
Took two test drives in both.

Chrysler was so much better looking than the Quest which is the ugliest minivan out there.
I really could not get past that. 

Finally rented a T&C for a 150 mile day trip.
The van averaged over 30 MPG.
Although the rental was a 2014, it had over 30,000 miles and it still felt, drove and sounded like brand new.
That did it for me.

We bought a Chrysler Town & Country the next day and paid $3,000 less than a comparably equipped Nissan.

UPDATE:   In Fall 2016, I test drove a Pacifica whose only advantage was a quieter ride at highway speeds.   
The Pacifica had lots of little things I did not like.  
We are definitely keeping the Town and Country which is a better vehicle all around.

UPDATE:  January 2020  -  Overall, the T&C has been a great car - especially with the new set of Cooper tires.  Still feels tight and drives like new.   After 4 years, both key fobs failed and had to be replaced/reprogrammed - cost nearly $500 for the pair.    The on-board GPS navigation system does NOT update automatically over the air and it's expensive.   Annual updates are $100-$150 which is ridiculous when you can buy a handheld Garmin with live traffic and free updates for life for $150 !!!    In 2019, after 5 years, I finally bought a system and map update and have yet to install it because it is a very complicated process and takes 2 hours with the engine running.

chrysler,town-and-country,2014,Lance Hogue, 04/04/2017,30th Anniversary Edition- Update @ 36 mths,4,"Now at 71,000 miles ..2 Major unusual Repairs now ..70 K found oil leaking in driveway. Repair was a leaking oil filter housing made of plastic ! was under secret warranty till 5 yrs or 100K but I was just over the years in time ..Cost to repair $1000.00! So its plastic someone could have turned oil filter in too tight or off thread , heat and cold of engine ect could have been cause ..Still drives like a charm ! At 57,000 miles another unusual leaking transmission fluid in driveway. Required replacement of transmission oil cooling lines ...$350.00. Not to happy with these repairs..At 54,000 miles now and 1.5 yr of ownership still loving this van ..Latest ..rust bubbles coming up on lip of hood where meet grill Took to dealer this week and they took pictures and sent to Chrysler awaiting to hear back on dispo. Put new Michelins Defender LTX M/S tires on at Costco during the September deal $646.00 Guy didnt remove old weights and truck was shaking Had to return and get all wheels rebalanced.. Not due for major service till 60K miles. Runs like a gem great to haul stuff with and in .Prior Just a couple of oil chances for maintenance, and a burned out LED rear light which cost around $100.00 for a knock off online. Mopar wanted way to much money for a OME light assembly. Great Bargain Vehicle purchased just coming off 2 yr lease. It had just 36K miles on it .Comfortable to drive lotsa bells and whistles..Likes: ride, comfort, Auto Start and push button start, Heated front and rear seats and wheel, Lane change assist very helpful for blind areas in rear ,Rear power stow n go seat is power, Back up sensors,camera etc great for warning something is approaching, Stow and Go all seats makes for a lot of room for hauling stuff. Needs improvement: Navigation is Garmin Cant see it very well from drivers seat, slow to respond when you miss a turn, colors poor and hard to see in light, did software update and radio blew up, luckily Chrysler Uconnect covered it with new radio under extended warranty, maps outdated and limited ability, Nav not worth extra money nor updating maps which can be done usually every June from 3rd party company on usb for $150.00. Wipers have auto sensors and go crazy in rain sometimes wiping so fast you think there gonna fly off windshield. When lights on auto and come on at dusk the entire dash goes dark ...have to adjust interior light knob. Rear view mirror has all kinds of stuff rigged into it ..very small in size would like it to be bigger to see more. Vehicle came with a can of air and jack and empty cage underneath with no spare ! $255 to purchase on Amazon. Dealer way higher .Had a Class 3 Hitch put on vehicle for towing trailer which it does nicely. Overall good bargain for used vehicle. When shopping pay attention to options listed as these vehicles all have different options I found many of these used vehicle sales people have no clue about them and the dealers list options that actually aren't on the vehicle. Recommend you go online and research VIN for original window sticker which can be had for free and then check vehicle to make sure it actually has the options listed. Check underneath for spare tire ! Check to ensure all options are actually working before purchasing ..2014 was last  year Chrysler gave the longer warranty on the engine and transmission rust roadside assistance etc 5 yrs or 100K This is our 3rd Chrysler Mini Van and by far much improved over the 2001 model we still have.

chrysler,town-and-country,2014,June Keck, 07/02/2017,Good Family Van With Some Negatives,4,"Owned a 2003 for 14yrs. So decided to go with another Town and Country. Got a 2014 30th Anniversary model. Has some advantages over the old girl: back up camera & sensors, rear cross-traffic sensors, blind spot sensors, improved acceleration and braking, great turning radius, stow-n-go seats, sliding doors are much improved, keyless entry, remote start. Has some disadvantages: the frame below the front doors hits me right on the ankle bone when I get in and out which is aggravating, transmissions shifting is a little rougher and I can hear a bearing noise when driving which might mean a rebuild down the road, seems to have more road noise as my 2003 T&C, sound system is definitely not as good as the 2003 T&C. My Biggest gripe are the tires, they suck big time. The tires on my 2003 T&C were Bridgestone Turanza EL42Bz. They were a little expensive when time to replace but well worth the price. Didn't matter the road conditions, they didn't lose their grip. The tires on the 2014 T&C are Michelin Energy Saver A/S. They are honestly one of the worst tires I've had on any vehicle I've owned. Braking is great as long as it's on dry pavement. If you have to take off quickly from a stop I chirp or spin the tires almost every time, even when trying not to. Horrible on rainy roads, not looking forward to winter. We'll be changing them hopefully to Bridgestone Turanza before winter if they have them in the new size. If not, probably will still change them, they're that bad. Dealership of course won't do anything to help with running boards or the tires.

Blind Spot Monitoring, Cross Path Detection and other options that add comfort and safety to the driving experience.

chrysler,town-and-country,2014,Dave Yallup, 12/06/2018,Handy dandy van!,4,This van is exactly what I was looking for.  Before retirement we had a pickup and a car but wanted to limit to one to keep cost down.  The Town and Country with it's ability to store the seats in the floor gives us the cargo space of the pickup and the comfort of the car.
chrysler,town-and-country,2014,Tom K., 08/05/2015,MAP UPDATES @ $149 each year - DARK rear WINDOWS,4,"MAP UPDATES will cost you $149 EACH YEAR plus taxes and fees.    They don't tell you that when you buy the car.    What a rip-off.   What's worse is that you can only get firmware updates IF you buy the map updates - no other way.    This cost is never mentioned by the salespeople nor does it appear on the website or in the sales brochure.

Reality check - You can buy a Garmin hand held GPS with lifetime maps and live traffic updates for less than the cost of an annual update on your Chrysler T&C.
----------------
WINDOW DESIGN FLAW -  Here's another thing I HATE.  The WINDOWS on the 2nd and 3rd row as well as on the tailgate are very DARK.  It's noticeable in the daylight but not a real problem.   However, at NIGHT - visibility is absolutely awful - you can barely see through the dark glass except in very well lit areas.   The engineers who design these cars should be forced to drive prototypes under dark conditions before manufacturing and releasing them for sale to the public.   Our two previous minivans - A Chevrolet VENTURE and UPLANDER both had tinted windows but they were perfectly fine at night - the Chrysler is not.

UPDATES:  Having owned the car T&C for about 2 1/2 years, I am still very happy with it except for the two issues detailed previously.   Love the excellent daytime visibility through the big windshield and front seat windows.   The car handles well and we have gotten as much as 31 MPG on the road IF I keep the speed at about  60~65 mph.   Great engine, excellent brakes.   The T&C is a far better vehicle than its Pacifica replacement which feels much smaller and has too many gimmicky features and is overpriced.

At 3 1/2 years, two other problems have developed.   After heavy rain and sub-freezing temperatures, the sliding doors have frozen up and could not be opened either by the motors or by hand for at least 15 minutes.     Also both key FOBS are failing.  One is almost useless - tailgate and slider buttons do NOT work at all and the LOCK/UNLOCK function works about 70% of the time.    
I did replace BOTH FOBS at a cost of almost $400 (including programming) for the two FOBS.   In the past, on 5 other cars, I have never had key FOBS fail.  The longest owned was 15 years and when I sold that car, both FOBS were still fully functional.  

At 4 1/2 years, both rear shock absorbers have had to be replaced - TWICE - at our expense.   The small blue Chrysler name badges have fallen off on the hood and tailgate.  Never had that happen before on any car I ever owned.  Car still drives very well getting very good mpg.  Great engine.  Great brakes.  Paint looks like new even though car is NOT garaged.

At 6 years and 56,000 miles, the Chrysler T&C stills looks and drives like new !    Engine, steering and brakes are as good as ever.   A year ago, I bought the map update but the thumb drive the map company sent me contained software incompatible with the Chrysler.  I do not have the patience nor experience to do the required workaround to download and install the update so I will have to make an appointment with the dealer.

I cannot believe Chrysler has ended the T&C and went with the Pacifica. The 2017 Pacifica is nice and great features but too $$$ and the lower end doesn't have the same features  - DVD, etc as the lower end T&C. That is why I bought the lease.

chrysler,town-and-country,2014,Richard Rohrer, 02/19/2018,"Good Vehicle, Crappy tires",4,"Car gets great gas mileage, especially on the highway.  Very comfortable for long trips.  We had driven across country in it several times.  Navigation system sucks.  Passenger can't type in destination when vehicle is in motion.  Unit is a Garmin and technology wise it is several years out of date.  Cost to update maps is $150, if you do it your self or about $300 if the dealer does it.  Ours van came with Kumo tires, which are really crappy.  Two of them were date coded 2010 and two 2012, we did get 65k out of them, before the sidewall cracked.  Would have been fun in North Dakota, going 80 mph to have a tire failure.  Like the vehicle, but would insist on different tires if we were purchasing again.

After 180,000 mi in 5 years still like the car.  The only major problem we have had is the oil sensor has had to be replaced twice, which was a major repair.  The second time the part was on national back order, so it took over a week to get the part.  Chrysler would not cover the repeated repair.

We now have 196k miles on the vehicle and had to replace that catalytic converter, which was expensive, but only two months car payments for a new vehicle.  The gas mileage improved slightly with the new converters, about 27 mph on the highway.  We are trying to make this a moon car, i.e. over 248k miles.  We like the ride and the spacesness of the vehicle.  It has been two all lower 48 states at least once and most of them twice.   Our mechanic says the car should go to about 300k.

Had issue with power steering making noise & feeling funny, brought it into dealership they said nothing was wrong three visits later it was bad gaskets and bearings now it's fixed. Brought  car in for brakes system slipping on stop and feeling bad like they're not working  properly since December 2014. Brought car in again for the 10th time  as instructed by Chrysler Escalation Customer Service Dept.  they said brakes were perfect.  but breaks still slipping at a normal stop or  slow down at stop  signs and to slow down to make turns. Called customer service been dealing with them since last year in August I have had eight different representatives five escalation department representatives and nobody has helped me at all.  Engine runs very rough and starter legs at start and feels like it won't start randomly service dept  says can't be duplicated but it is happening constantly for me. Chrysler is not part of the  BBB so they will not deal with the BBB complaints. They are not part of consumer affairs so they won't deal with consumer affairs complaints. When you call Chrysler for help they just tell you to take it back to dealerships.  Chrysler Customer Service is not there to help you they are there to just keep giving you the runaround and tossing you to different people making you waste your time at dealerships trying to get it fixed until your warranty runs out at 36,000 miles my issues have been since I had 2000 miles on my car and now I'm at 21,000 miles on my car and still nothing is been fixed except for my power steering gasket and bearings.  At this point I'm at fear that my brakes will go out that is my opinion but everyone else seems to think that nothings wrong with my car except for me my husband and other people that I've had drive my car ask me what's wrong with your breaks so I know something is really wrong even though Chrysler in the dealerships are giving me a stupid feedback that there's nothing wrong one dealership says brakes are great a week later another dealership says rotors are warped another dealership says rotors are great  I want after that Kreiser says there is no warrantee for your rotors even if they go bad after four months from when you bought your car. So if your rotors are bad from the day you buy your car I was told by the Chrysler Escalation Customer Service Department tamara that if it is the rotors that were bad from the day I bought my car that I would have to pay the $500 to have them replaced. Chrysler will not cover the rotors even if they were poor quality or already bad the day you bought your car FYI

I get 27 mpg overall.  I tow a 35000 lb boat with no problems - I have the towing package.  The heated seats and steering wheel are great in the cold weather here in Wisconsin.  I have no problems with snow, ice, and rain.  I just replaced the Michelin Energy Saver tires with Defenders.  These tires have better traction.  With the Energy Savers, I got a lot of tire squeal when I started up briskly to fit into traffic.  The Defenders do not squeal - I just go.  The 3.6 engine has a lot of power so I can get into traffic easily.  This is the best of seven Chrysler minivans that I have owned since my first one in 1988.  I have never had a problem with any of my vans.  I do change the transmission fluid every 30,000 miles and change the engine oil on this van at 4,000 miles.  This maintenance has kept my vans from repairs on engines and transmissions.  Now, with 85,000 miles on this van, it runs like new.  My new Michelin tires get me through the snow with no problem.  I just drove through 11.5 inches of snow on my way home on Hwy 57 here in Wisconsin.  On this drive, I saw 25 or so cars in the ditch. I had no problems!  I really love this van. On a recent 600 mile trip, I got 30.8mpg (300 mi out and 300 mi return) I sold this van to my son.  He and his wife and daughter love it.  This was the best van ever.  I now have a 2019 Chrysler Pacifica which has more features and a quieter ride.  I think the 2014 was  easier to drive and had better vision. It had better ground clearance which is a concern with the snow we get in Wisconsin.  I miss the hard drive for music.  My Pacifica uses thumb drives for music storage and has a better sound system.

One would think back seat comfort would be important in a car where buyers will almost definitely be buying the vehicle specifically for the purpose of having comfortable back seats, but alas, Chryster disagrees. Again, the rest of the car is exactly what you'd expect for the price and make: ok MPG, ok outward and inward appearance, ok sound system. Below average shock absorption as well."

chrysler,town-and-country,2014,Ray, 01/27/2016,Disappointed in navigation system,4,"I think that Chrysler has done it self and its customers a disservice with their inclusion of the Garmin navigation system.  Lifetime maps should be included even if it adds to the price.  It is a safety issue to not have up to date maps.  A reasonable price like $25 wouldn't be bad but I will not pay $149 + to update maps.  My TomTom has free map updates and only cost $89.  Also all available safety features should be standard.  We will be getting rid of our van in a year of so.
These are still the only complaints we have.  Another problem is that there is no spare tire included.  We have had 2 tire punctures in 22,000 miles, fortunately they were in town.
The last road trip we averaged over 29 mpg with both city and highway driving.  We had an issue with the engine light coming on and it turned out to be the sensor that makes the light come on was faulty.  Replaced under warranty.
"
chrysler,town-and-country,2014,Patty, 07/17/2017,Big Mistake,2,"I like this vehicle because of the front visibility and the space availability. That is where it ends. Seats are not comfortable. The AC broke at 50,000 miles and I live in NY where I rarely use the AC. The repair was $900 and the next summer it was broken again. What should have been fixed the first time was not fixed correctly and it cost me another $700. Chrysler Corporation was no help whatsoever. They do not stand behind their poorly engineered product. In the winter, this vehicle is worthless at best and dangerous. It performs poorly even with a tiny bit of snow or slush. Update: I replaced all 4 tires with snow tires ($600.00) and this winter, it does perform better in the snow. I will have the expense every year of switching tires from winter to all season. Another glitch with this vehicle is the tire size. The vehicle has a 16 inch wheel but the book car service shops consult states a 17 inch tire, so when I buy tires, I have to make sure to tell them 16, not 17. I once waited 3 hours only to have them tell me the tires did not fit and they had to order 16 inch tires. Not all 2012 T and C's were created equal. I understand they no longer make this vehicle and have replaced it with the ""Pacifica"" I will NOT buy another Chrysler. The ""stow and go"" seats, although and improvement, are not as easy to operate as you see in a tv commercial.  To stow or re-seat, you have to move the front seats all the way forward, move all mats, and then pull very hard to get the seat up out of storage. I am over 60, but very strong, fit and active. I honestly can't see some of my age group friends having an easy time of this...so senior citizens, beware. On the plus side, it is a roomy vehicle and with all passenger seats stowed, I can fit a full sheet of plywood or wallboard,which is nice since I can haul this stuff even in bad weather. I also fit a full size couch in it. If roomy is what you need and you don't care about comfort and reliability (hahaha) then buy this van.

chrysler,town-and-country,2014,Darin B., 12/09/2016,The vehicle you buy for all the wrong reasons,1,"The Chrysler Town and Country is awful in nearly every single way, right down to the stupid key FOB that makes you feel like a toddler every time you start the van (hint: it's built entirely out of plastic, even the part that goes into the ignition). There are only three reasons people buy this vehicle: 1. They are a die-hard Chrysler supporter or they are under the false impression that it and its sibling the Dodge Grand Caravan are the only way to support domestic jobs (the Honda Odyssey and Toyota Sienna are both more American, according to parts origin, than the Town and Country). 2. They don't have enough money to buy a better van and get the same features. 3. They haven't done enough research to know that there are better options. We fell under the second category. Since we were buying used and the Odyssey and Sienna actually hold their resale value, the Town and Country was the only like-new used vehicle we could afford. After owning it for awhile, I wish we would have just purchased an Odyssey or Sienna with 100,000 miles. First and foremost, it is horribly uncomfortable. The front seats are adequate. Beyond that, you're going to be miserable. It is a traditions that the captains chairs in minivans are like a king's seat. In this vehicle, they're awful. This is because Chrysler wants to sell vehicles on lingo such as Stow N Go because they know they can't measure up otherwise. Stow N Go is convenient. However, it means the seats are thinly cushioned and oddly inclined so they can fit into the floor. The back seat is even worse. I'm 34 years old and I can barely get out of it once I sit there. It's like it sucks you in down hill, and you're stuck.  We have two rear facing car seats and have to put ridiculous amounts of padding underneath the seat for it to sit level enough. The lack of leg room in the third row makes it so, with the car seats, any passenger outside of the first row is going to be miserable. I can't peg it down to one particular thing (other than possibly too high of windows and black seats and trim, but the interior also feels like a dungeon, like you're trapped in some sort of cave. I drive most of the time and appreciate the seat controls and that the steering wheel moves up and down as well as in and out. Despite seemingly limitless driving positions, my neck always hurts severely after long drives. It's one of those vehicles where you just can't get comfortable period. On the road, the Town and Country seems to be relatively quiet and handles bumps decently. The handling isn't great. When I'm locked in at 70 m.p.h. on the interstate, I feel like if I had to attempt any emergency handling, we would end up in a pile of rubble.  My Mom, who has never had a panic attack otherwise, has a panic attack when she has to ride in the back of the van because it feels so dangerous. The transmission is clunky and has extremely hard shifts sometimes. The motor seems to be strong and runs smoothly. However, the fuel mileage is horrible. Don't trust the overly-optimistic information the vehicle gives you. Your mileage will almost always be 2-3 MPG worse than the van's information center tells you. Looks wise, the only uglier minivan is the Nissan Quest, but of course that opinion will differ from person to person. If you truly research it (and believe me, I over research everything), a minivan is safer than most vehicles. Therefore, the Town and Country overall is very safe. However, it failed miserably in the IIHS small overlap crash test. That type of crash is rare, but if it happens to you you'll probably lose your leg and maybe your life. I think about that every time I enter the van. Competitors such as the Sienna, Odyssey and the new Kia Sedona all passed this test. If you buy this vehicle, you will regret it. I know I do, every time I climb behind it's wheel. The only people who may like it are empty nesters
 who are only going to use the front seats. Anyone else who likes it is likely ignorant about the better options that exist.

I was extremely happy about this because I was driving a 2006 Dodge caravan at the time.  When I switched to the new Town and Country I noticed such an improvement in luxury and technology.  The immediate negative I noticed is how the dodge had a more consistent transmission.  The town and country had weird hiccups when changing gears.  It wasnt a huge issue but it was noticeable.   
I drive a lot for work so the audio was a big improvement for me.  My personal car has bluetooth and a decent sound system.  This van is actually pretty sweet when it comes to listening to music and podcasts.  The handsfree system is very convenient.  The DVD seems to work well....I do not use this very much.
The room inside is what you would expect from vans now a days.  Doors open smoothly, and the seats in the rear fold up pretty easy.  
Overall, pretty cool van.

chrysler,town-and-country,2015,Dan, 05/01/2016,The car clearly gets little love from the company,4,"Rented the car for 3-4 days.  Town and country is not a bad car, but notwithstanding some sprinkling of some technological features, it feels dated in many aspects.  The interior materials are so-so, the thin rear passenger seats are amusing.  But the biggest surprise to me was the transmission used on that car.   Even the AT transmission in 2009 Toyota Camry is more advanced and intelligent then in this ""luxury"" van.   The transmission has no hill grade logic at all.  Going up or down the hill or during the times when  engine braking would be beneficial it acts as all the old typical AT transmission do - it either doesn't do anything at all or  constantly hunts gears.  

The engine power is adequate however and the ride is pleasantly comfortable and smooth.

chrysler,town-and-country,2015,Katie, 03/30/2016,"If you are considering buying, Not worth the buy",2,"My friend and I rented this van for a week long road trip to California from the Midwest. The van was very comfortable. The reason I am giving it a 2 star is because of 2 specific reasons. Number one, is sometimes it didn't switch gears so smoothly. It only had 40,000 miles on it. I made the mistake of buying a car that doesn't switch gears smoothly. And believe me, if it's doing this at 40,000 miles it's not worth your money. Number 2 is because my friends fiancé happened to be road tripping with the same exact minivan (similar mileage) to Florida with some buddies and their alternator blew on the way back. We loved the stow and go seats though! As well as the technology in the van, although I didn't love the way the steering wheel technological controls were set up. Overall, it lasted us on our trip and was a smooth ride for the most part but didn't last her fiancé and his buddies so I don't think it's an investment to choose. I regularly drive a new Toyota Sienna for work and I would think the average person would get the better end of a deal with that or a Honda Odyssey (which my parents used to own).

chrysler,town-and-country,2015,Des7171, 10/16/2019,Mad mom in mini van,3,"Dear Chrysler,

I appreciate that you are trying to help the local dealership/mechanic shop (I can only hope this is true) to get post sale business for certain mechanical issues....   

As a preface, over the last 20 years I have gone from owning two low rider trucks, a custom modified turbo charged honda civic and most recently, a 1997 BMW Z3 2.8 L Convertible (post mini van).

I have also always been able to pride myself on being able to change my oil, fix things within my ability (most recently, fixing all the wiring in my BMW center console) ect..  I rarely, if ever admit defeat (unless necessary and above my ability).  I am also  not embarrassed to asked for help either. 

Until today, I thought my most embarrassing car life moments was going from cool ride, to fast ride, to ""it's safe"" and purchasing the mini van.  

I tried to disguise my shame by purchasing the 2015 Chrysler Town and Country Mini van that boasts leather seats, store away seating and an Entertainment System (do you know how much we paid back in the day to have our show cars upgraded with that?) 😂

 
However, today I was embarrassingly defeated after trying to check (and potentially having to refill) my transmission fluid for the reason of getting the lovely P0704 code, literally 5,000 after the factory power train warranty expired.

Unfortunately your corporation made the decision that the only qualified dealership employees are capable of checking (and finding the damn location of the transmission fluid spout) and us “DIYers” are second class and are likely thought to not have the ability to find our own shoe strings, let alone to be able to tie them. 

Furthermore, is extremely disappointing that you feel its necessary to make something that is standard maintenance (like an oil change) so ridiculously complicated.... 😂🤦‍♀️

It had always made a grinding noise underneath which got worse right before it died.  Chrysler fixed it under powertrain warranty.  I was still out about $1000 due to this happening on a vacation.  Extra expense to get home and to go back to retrieve it 2 week add later.  Chrysler gave me a small amount back - around 200 of it.

If it's too much then just the simple options is best . But I will give these options a try and so far so good.

chrysler,town-and-country,2016,Mike Conner, 04/02/2016,"Hey, It's a minivan, not a sports car",5,"This vehicle offers by far the best ""bang for the buck"" out there.  Dodge/Chrysler has the van down to a science.  We have had several of these, and each time we get a new one, Chrysler has added the one thing I said, ""Gee this would be perfect if only it had...""   Example: More USB ports. Everyone has their own phone and on long trips they always need charging.  There are at least 2 in the back seat and 3 up front.  Maybe even more I don't see. 
If you remove and/or tuck in the seats, there is no reason for a suburbanite to get a truck.  It' amazing what fits in there.

Only complaints: 
1. The interior materials are very cheap looking, and just over all ""blah.""  It seems so flimsy I almost think it will crack.
2. The Bluetooth.  It's easier than the GM stuff, but still a pain in the neck to figure out.  We have paired two phones about 10 times in 2 months and cannot figure out why they won't stay connected.

chrysler,town-and-country,2016,Jon, 04/05/2016,As exciting as mini-van ownership gets,4,"It was a tough pill to swallow going from a luxury crossover SUV to a mini-van, but we felt the Town and Country was a better option than the other vans.  We started looking at the Sienna because I wanted AWD.  Unfortunately, it lived up to my previous experiences with Toyotas.  When it comes to driving excitement, Toyota doesn't have a clue.  We had to push the pedal half way to the floor to get it to move, and even then the acceleration was pathetic.  The Honda was better, but for the money, I felt both Toyota and Honda interiors were just okay.  When I saw that I could get a fully loaded Town and Country for the price of an entry level Toyota, I was shocked.  I was also pretty impressed with the Napa leather quality in the Limited.  Sure the fit and finish is typical domestic with plastic interior parts that have uneven seams, but it was hard to argue with the price.  The acceleration is actually quite peppy for a mini-van as well.  My wife quickly fell in love with it, and we made a great deal.  My fears of quality came true one week after we bought it when the TV console developed a nasty rattle.  We took it to the dealer and they said, ""they are all made like that"".  Sad excuse, but they made a rubber gasket for it, and it seems to be better for now.  We don't seem to be getting the advertised gas mileage at this point, but it is a mini-van, not a Prius.  Our plan is to keep it for 3-4 years, and I think it will be more than adequate for that period of time as long as things don't fall apart.

*Update: Over a year and a half into it now.  Wife still loves it, and we haven't had any major issues.  At a year old, opening and closing the sliding doors sounded like we were rolling marbles down the side of the van.  After fighting with the dealer a bit, they lubed them, and for now that seems to have worked.  The transmission shifts a little funky sometimes, but I plan to extend the warranty as long as we keep it.

chrysler,town-and-country,2016,Gerald Boettcher, 12/15/2015,Best Mini-van ever!,5,"This is my seventh Town and Country.  The six before this had over 100,000 mile on them with no engine or transmission problems.  My 2002 went over 250,000 miles with no engine or transmissions problems.  My present 2014 has 104,000 mile on it.  It gets up to 31 mpg on the road and averages 26 mpg overall.  I love the spacious interior and the way it holds the road.  There is one thing that is not to my satisfaction.   The  chrome all over the dash  reflects the sun into my eyes.  I painted over the chrome and now love the layout of the dash with the readout for the vehicle speed.  I have the trailer tow package and have no problem pulling my 3200 lb boat.  The engine is powerful enough for this as well as getting up to speed and entering the highway on ramps.  You can't do much better in a minivan - great value for the price.  Reliable and comfortable and great on gas.  I get 27.1 combined gas mileage at this time.   I will  be getting new tires in November before winter.  I now have 104,000 miles on this van.    I still love this van and enjoy driving it.  What a great van!  The noise from the sliding doors has stopped.  I love this van even more than I did before.  I  got the opportunity to test my Michelin Defender tires in the snow last spring.  Good traction, even in 11"" of snow. What a great minivan!  I may keep this T&C for many more years.  I like the hard drive for music and the layout of the dash.  I like being able to use all of the features I have (TOO MANY TO LIST HERE). We have a 2017 Jeep Cherokee with a complicated display.  It is necessary to take your eyes off of the road in order to turn on the heated seats and steering wheel and other features. Way too many icons.  I can do this in my T&C with my eyes on the road.  I am selling this van to my son.  I have ordered a new Pacifica Touring L Pluss. which should be here in mid July.  This is Chrysler van # 8.  I love these Chryslers they are trouble free and an excellent value for the money.

chrysler,town-and-country,2016,Brachmw, 05/01/2017,Could be worse.,5,"Looked at the new Pacificas and didn't like the price or the interior space for those.  My van was at least 6K cheaper then the cheapest current year van and came with a DVD and leather, while the new 17 model Pacifica had no DVD and cloth seats and they were asking 43K.  I was disappointed about no spare tire, just a blow up kit so I purchased the spare which I was told would cut down on my MPG.  i went from from Colorado Springs to Denver's DIA and averaged 31.5 MPG.  I love the van as i have a lot of leg room in front.  Most cars I tried were cramped with my knee hitting the center console.  My family lays it on about owning a van, but I have never been more comfortable driving.  The acceleration on this thing is fantastic.  2 years and 16k miles later she is still running like new!

chrysler,town-and-country,2016,Don Benedict, 08/18/2016,Not for the Mountains (CORRECTED) Good Van,4,"There are only two gears, forward and reverse.  The options for the transmission are : Park, Neutral, Reverse, and Drive. There are no lower gears to assist in braking when driving downhill. On a recent trip, we were returning from a family trip to Pagosa Springs in southern Colorado.  When driving over Wolf Creek pass on Hi-Way 160, I could not shift to a lower gear when descending from the pass so had to ride the brakes to keep the speed down.  The brakes apparently overheated and each time applied a loud rumbling from the brakes occurred.  This is not a necessarily steep decline and is a well used Hi-Way.  I was very concerned and will try to avoid the Colorado mountain roads while driving this vehicle.
CORRECTION:  I HAVE NOW LEARNED HOW TO DOWNSHIFT.  When the gear selector is in the 'Drive' position, tap the gear selector to the left to downshift and to the right to upshift back to drive. It is amazing that I did not know this feature even after researching the web and the drivers manual. It is an electronic shifting system.
Now, I like the van but wish the NAV system was better much like the Jeep Nav and phone system."
chrysler,town-and-country,2016,Ted Hoffman, 09/22/2016,"Best decision was ""going mini van""!",4,"My wife and I are in our 50's and a new 2016 Chrysler Town & Country Touring just made sense to us. We're getting older, but still like to get around! The optional side steps are helpful getting in and out. I always drove a car, including a Chrysler 300C! The mini van offers the versatility of stow and go seats, tons of space for flea market purchases, great visability and a back-up camera. I don't like backing up a vehicle, so any safety aid helps me. We became first-time grandparents this year, so comfortable, safe seating is important. The DVD player is there to entertain. Must haves of heated seats and steering wheel warm my backside and hands quickly! The Town & Country  is no sportscar, but rides smoothly and I feel confident behind the wheel. After several months of ownership, with short trips, two-hour excursions with carrying purchases and baby shower gifts, the conversion from people mover to delivery vehicle has been easy. There have been zero issues, and I'm happy with this mini van purchase.

Updated 9/26/18

The Town & Country has performed with no problems except a rattle we can't seem to find! Just routine service and now at 22,000 miles. A new choice is a Chrysler Pacifica. Terrific! A relative just purchased one.  UPDATED 11/05/18: Unfortunately, I was in a serious car accident with my Town and Country in late October. I rear-ended a parked flatbed truck, totaling my vehicle! The good news is that the airbags deployed and I walked away uninjured. I plan on purchasing a new 2019 Chrysler Pacifica this week.

chrysler,town-and-country,2016,barbara, 01/05/2019,"76,000 and blown transmission",2,"we have a 2013 town and country with 76,983 miles on it when it stopped moving.  transmission needs to be replaced and Chrysler does take any ownership of the issue.  This is completely unacceptable.  The transmission is a sealed unit, we cannot add or check fluids.  We had it inspected by the dealership in Aug, and it is now Dec when this happened ( while taking kids caroling).  This van is quite good or at least as good as most minivans in every other way, but to have to pay $3200 to replace a transmission on a vehicle that has only 76,000 miles shows there is some major problems with Chrysler!

chrysler,town-and-country,2016,Mike, 01/28/2020,Worst car my family has ever owned.,1,"My mother bought this car when the old SUV wasn't working out for everyone and she wanted more space. Overall, it's a horrific car and completely unreliable. At 41K, the engine blew a head gasket and cylinder #6 spark plug coil which caused a lack of compression. At only 62K, the engine and transmission both failed. It blew the other head gasket and snapped the camshaft. I've only ever seen a camshaft failure in motorsports with engines producing in excess of 1000 horsepower. The transmission's pump went out which caused a severe lack of lubrication and destroyed the transmission. It was serviced properly as recommended by the factory. This car was not abused and didn't see any speeds past 80MPH.

chrysler,town-and-country,2016,Janet Boltz, 09/03/2016,Hate the sliding side doors,3,"I like the town and country but will not buy another until they do away with the sliding side doors.  They do not last long even after you get them fixed. The side doors have to be manually opened and not sliding for me.  Have also spent a lot of money fixing the air conditioner

chrysler,town-and-country,2016,Jim, 04/23/2019,Our 3rd Stow and Go Van,5,"We have had 3 of the Chrysler/Dodge minivans since the Stow and Go introduction in 2005.  We sold the 1st on a dumb whim at 2 years old.  The 2nd is now being used by our kids in Florida.  Paid out for a bunch of repairs for engine leaks before they got it.  We intend to keep the 3rd for a long time, so we purchased the factory lifetime Max Care warranty.
We considered buying a 2017 Pacifica, but the price was higher.  Really can't complain about our decision.  The T&C has been exactly what we expected.  
Nothing compares to the convenience  and convertibility of Stow and Go seating.  Eight person seating would be nice upon occasion, especially with a load of grandkids.  Add a towing package and you have decent cargo capability.
Update April, 2020
Currently at 55,000 miles. No repairs  since purchase.  There iis an engine ""whine"" that I will have checked at my next service appointment.  I updated the navigation maps a few months ago, which is not a job for the faint-hearted.

chrysler,town-and-country,2016,hobart, 10/14/2018,get a toyota instead! these are junk now!,1,"They are not what they used to be ... I had 3 previous caravans so thought this would be good... Its junk compared to the others and my former van which was a toyota with 187000 miles on it ( that was totaled)   This seemed nice at first but the seats don't adjust nicely to my somewhat short legs.  At 44000miles the thing started rattling and now drives like a truck not a touring vehicle.... then we get a warning light and it turns out a head cylinder was defective so the thing needed to be taken apart and replaced.   Thankfully but not without a little argument the dealer did that under warranty.   Never managed to get the phone to sync... probably because the car was a leased one and the other guys phone is on there... so is his hideous barbara Streisand music... I cannot get it off and there is no manual for the electronics included...I got a cd with instructions and there was nothing on that that helped at all...Oh... and the front bumper cracked on a snow bank... this now has 54000 miles on it and i cannot even trust it to drive it accross country to see my son... which is what I purchased it for.   hope this helps... wish i had known what I was getting into... what a big mistake!!!!!   UPDATE  got rid of it ..whew.. no i can go on a road trip with confidence...

chrysler,town-and-country,2016,Keisha, 12/04/2018,Bad sliding doors,3,"I bought the t&c touring and fell in love during the test drive. After 5 months I had to get 3 new tires. Three months later it needs an alignment. At the same time I start having problems with the automatic sliding doors. When you push to open them, it will open all the way then just start to shut itself (my 4 year old was almost crushed by the door while trying to get in). No auto shop can tell me what's wrong with it. Gas mileage is really not the best. And transmission shifts hard sometimes. Not the quietest ride. It looks beautiful on the inside and all the features are very nice, but the overall quality is pretty poor.

The stow and go seat system is super convenient. I moved 22 years worth of stuff in my van and was surprised with the ease I was able to do it with thanks to the low tailgate floor and high clearance of the tailgate door.

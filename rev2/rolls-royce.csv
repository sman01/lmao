rolls-royce,ghost-series-ii,2016,MB, 09/07/2020,Everything I expected and more,5,"The car is smooth, quiet, and rides exceptionally well.  The paint is stunning; the coachline is a treasure, and the interior is beyond belief in terms of how everything looks, feels, and works.  Of course it is -- that's what Rolls-Royce is all about.  

What I *didn't* expect was how satisfying this car is to drive.  It offers stunning acceleration (especially if you floor it when merging onto a highway).  I expected the handling to be ""ponderous""; what I got was ""responsive"".  

It's big and it's heavy and there's no hiding that.  But in its element -- high-speed highway driving -- it's exquisite.  It comports itself well enough on back roads, too, making it an all-round delight.  You won't confuse this with a Miata (I have one, so I know); think more like a big BMW sedan (like a Five Series).

I lucked out in that my car has the Dynamic Driving Package. Not sure how big a difference it makes, I just know that this car is surprisingly fun to drive in any situation.

The features and options just add to the enjoyment.  The Bespoke Audio system merits special mention.  From Mozart to Madonna, the sound is awesome.  Solid bass and clear highs.

I've had the car for almost a week, and the reality is setting in about what this car is and does.  And it's looking like the reality will be even better than the anticipation.

rolls-royce,phantom,2004,Carlos Marrero, 04/11/2007,Just Awesome!,4,"When I finally reached the point in my life last year that I could afford one of these monsters, I jumped at the chance. This is by far and away the finest sedan I have ever owned and I have had several(S600,750il,S55 to name a few)The Phantom is an order of magnitude better. The main thing that I still can't get over is the level of comfort that Rolls has achieved with this car. On a recent road trip to Miami, I practically fell asleep driving down 95s in the middle of the day. The leather is just remarkable,as is the woodwork. While not as fast as the V-12 Germans, the car weighs 1000lbs more than the S600 and 760li. This car really hustles regardless of the extra pounds. I love it!"
rolls-royce,phantom,2004,RRowner for ever, 12/29/2003,The best car of the whole world,5," I love this car to the fullest. Every 
single detail of the car is perfect. I 
even enjoy the service of my RR 
dealership."
rolls-royce,phantom,2004,bjmcal, 02/24/2014,worst car i have ever owned,1,"I have spent appx $85000 on repairs on this car not to mention $16,000 while it was still under warranty, I only have 52,000 miles on it. I have replaced the floor mats once because they turned green and they are green again and ripped and torn. The rear view mirror is turning black and will have to be replaced soon. The leather seats look like I have put 200,000 miles on them and are all cracked and wrinkled. The hydraulics to hold the hood up are shot and most of the repairs have been electrical and oil leaks. I have had to replace the shocks 3 times and air bags. I rarely drive it over 40 miles per hour with an occasional trip on the freeway. Rolls Royce does nothing and customer service sucks.

rolls-royce,phantom,2004,NPW, 07/11/2006,Fabulous,4,Simply the very best automobile I have ever driven or owned.  The comfort and ease of driving is fabulous.
rolls-royce,phantom,2004,dean_thompson, 05/08/2004,Just Superb,5,"I love this car so much its perfect 
inside and out and has all the 
amenities of millionaire car."
rolls-royce,phantom,2004,Jayrat, 10/23/2004,Awesome,5,"This car is fun to drive, is classy, 
but not in most peoples price range!"
rolls-royce,phantom,2005,Wonderful Automobile, 05/04/2005,Lap of Luxury,4,"Having both driven and been a passenger in this car, the 2005 Rolls-Royce Phantom is perfect for anyone. You never feel like you are driving an automobile that weighs 6,000 lbs.  It provides passengers with tons of lucury."
rolls-royce,phantom,2005,Donald Kress, 04/22/2005,Phantom 2005,4,The 2005 Rolls-Royce Phantomis a joy to drive.  It handles like a much smaller car.  The turning radius is very good for a car of this size. the fit and finish are pure Rolls Royce.
rolls-royce,phantom,2005,Cam janowski, 02/17/2005,The Phantom Review,4,My 2005 Rolls-Royce Phantom is better than the Maybach 62 which I also have and enjoy.  The Phantom is a great car.  I cannot wait for the 100ex to arrive.
rolls-royce,phantom,2006,Acquirer, 11/21/2005,First Test Drive - Not Yet Acquired,4,"Upon test driving the Rolls Royce Phantom, I must say it has remarkably better handling than the Maybach 57.  The car is nimble and responsive, although power is subdued for enhanced comfort.  The greatest phenomenon upon my short drive is the remarkable handling of the car; the chassis mitigates its weight and bulk, providing the driver and the passengers with remarkable comfort and little body roll even in fast sharp corners.  Upon intense acceleration and at high speeds, there is absolutely no noise in the cockpit and absolutely no vibration.  The lack of vibration is thanks to a remarkable dual floor system, so the floor is not connected to the chassis.  This is a great car."
rolls-royce,phantom,2006,Bimmer Boy, 04/21/2006,Luxury Can't Get Any Better,4,"I love this car. I'm usually not into big cars, in fact I've never owned a car much bigger than a BMW 3-Series until this thing.  Driving it makes you feel so prestigious and good. For a big car, it turns pretty quickly and can turn pretty sharp.  It won't take the corners like a Porsche, but I've never driven anything this big that handles this well. Sit in the backseat an no one will know you're there.  There's a big piece of metal to hide your face.  Floor it all the way and you will realize that you can still have a conversation at normal volume.  There is hardly any noise in the cockpit and no vibrations at all. This car has no body roll ethier. The backseat is big enough to store a small car in."

rolls-royce,phantom,2006,AP, 04/19/2006,Underated,4,"When I entered the Rolls Royce dealership in San Francisco I just had to have it.  I took it for a spin, came back, and paid cash.  I love the looks that I get when I ride through the Bay Area."
rolls-royce,phantom,2006,cphillips, 01/11/2006,Refined Quality,4,"The Rolls-Royce Phantom exceeded my high expectations.  If given the opportunity, go drive this phenom at your nearist dealer.  Not only are you buying the car, you are buying the dealership."
rolls-royce,phantom,2007,The Man, 04/05/2007,The Ultimate in Luxurious Automobiles,4,"While I have only owned this car less then one calendar year, I have truly gotten to know her. Her name in my mind is the ""Queen of Luxury"" (all my cars have names). I have a driver, which is important to note because driving a phantom, and being driven in a phantom are two completely different things! The car is very heavy, but for its immense mass, she handles quite well. Fuel economy is miserable, but when you can spend nearly 400,000 on a car, you can most likely afford the gas. The back seat, which is where I spend the majority of my time when I am in the car, is as comfortable as my house, if not a little more. I chose the cinema configuration, which I believe was the best choice."
rolls-royce,phantom,2008,ron davi, 03/28/2008,magnificent,4,"The workmanship and actual ride itself is impeccable.  If you appreciate atttention to detail, you will admire all aspects of the automobile.  It is also very quitely responsive and powerful.  Everything you would hope for in a rolls."
rolls-royce,phantom,2009,Richard Smith, 02/11/2010,Deep Regret,2,"I deeply regret buying this junker. Complete waste of 300K. Even though it is superb in comfort and performance, it does not make up for the monstrous handling, the guzzling of fuel( Have to stop at nearly every single gas station, extremely annoying ) and most of all THE UGLY EXTERIOR AND INTERIOR!!! I still cant believe that I bought this hunk of Junk."

rolls-royce,phantom,2019,Steve West, 09/10/2020,This car is amazing,5,"I have owned this car for a few months and I have loved every moment in it. It looks absolutely amazing and I love it so much. The performance is what you would expect from a 5,000 pound car. 
"
rolls-royce,phantom,2019,Bono, 11/01/2020,Tire Problems,3,"I have had a 2019 phantom since the beginning of April and the car has been in the shop at least 3 times because of vibrations coming from the wheels and tires. The last time it was in the shop for 3 weeks! Other than that I really like the car. I think that the customer service of rolls royce is not that great.
"
rolls-royce,wraith,2016,Nik, 10/30/2016,Simply the best,5,"Outstanding and Definitely World Class Craftmanship, Elegance, and Stlye.
"
rolls-royce,wraith,2017,GJ, 02/20/2018,There is no question-this is the best car made,5,"Expect people to stop you and ask about this car. You will be seen driving this car. It is not a daily driver for instance you will not drive this car to Wal Mart. It's performance and design is the best I have ever seen. It is hand made with technology that is superior to most. The warranty is superior to most. It is covered bumper to bumper. It includes all maintenance. When it is time for routine maintenance  the dealer comes with a covered trailer and trailers it to the dealership. All maintenance   is included for the first four  years. Sirius radio with every thing is included for the first four years. I have had the car for over one year and absolutely no problems with it.

rolls-royce,ghost,2010,jimbo, 03/18/2010,OMG,4,"Ok - I've had 3 Bentleys and hold onto my GTC - but this is an amazing automobile.  All the good things from BMW parent - and the ""coach builder"" bits from venerable RR.  Terrific."
rolls-royce,ghost,2010,bob whalen, 06/03/2010,Good Car,5,"This car completes my colecton of Rolls Royces. I own a phantom, drop head coupe, coupe, phantom extended wheel base, and now the ghost. This one is far the best. Much better then the rest in handling, looks, and interior design. A definite buy."
rolls-royce,ghost,2010,Henry Smith, 07/10/2010,Fantastic,5,"Overall I am very pleased with this car. Former owner of a regular Phantom, which handled horribly. If you are gonna be chauffeured the rear seat in the ghost is actually larger then the Phantoms, which just shows you what good a car this is."
rolls-royce,ghost,2010,Capuchi Fentini, 07/09/2010,Good Vehicle- For Summer,5,"All in all, this vehicle is simply amazing. The ride is way better than my previous car a S65 AMG. I have yet to notice ANY wind or road noise at all. Only thing I miss is the handling, but what do you expect from such a Vehicle this large and heavy. Quality is what you would expect from such a nice car- top quality material throughout, the finest leather, the best grained wood, and everything else is of only the best quality. One major issue though, no AWD! I can only use this car during the warmer parts of the year. I have to use a second car (BMW 750i Xdrive) during winter. Even though that's a great vehicle, it or nothing else can come close the the Rolls."
rolls-royce,ghost,2010,Dan Gregory, 07/10/2010,Absurd Handling,5,"This car is good all around, but the handling is simply horrible. It is almost impossible to park without hitting something. More special light weight parts should be used to make it handle better"
rolls-royce,ghost,2010,BentleyBoy, 12/04/2020,You Get What You Pay For.....and more,5,"Mere words cannot express the sheer delight of owning this great automobile. It's hard to phantom the Quality, Luxury and Performance it offers. Having previously owned 5 Bentley's and 8 Rollers, you buy one knowing there's a Price to Pay for Happiness.....both in maintenance and fuel cost. But, common sense told you that from the get-go. 
I found that somewhere out there is a mechanic that tired of the 'politics' of working at a dealership and sprung-out on his own. It's still expensive but, it's worth 'The Ride'. The key in buying one was- research and locating a vehicle with service records, that was babied- which it deserves. This car falls into the category of being a 'collector' car, so it's primarily sought out with low-mileage, & priced accordingly. Yet, this is one car that CRIES to be driven and enjoyed- not parked in the garage on a pedestal, like your Ferrari. So, don't shine-on cars with 20-30,000 miles. Having 10 cars in the stable, you'll find this is the one you can't wait to drive. With it's Twin Turbo's, it's incredibly fast & quiet, given the 5400 lb. weight and it handles very well. Great for long trips, it swallows the road and floats down the highway like the silk sheets falling off your mattress. I actually like the Bentley interior design better but, there's more of an abundance of real chrome, fine wood and wider seats in the Rolls. Personally, I dodged the used ones loaded with 'Night Vision', 'Lane Change' and 'Starlight Headliners' as I envisioned technical problems down the road. I also precisely sought out the earlier 750il powered V12 version, as common knowledge would tell you, you can sidestep the UK pound vs the Euro Dollar on parts replacement- down the road. That installs this model in a better position to be a Collectors Item & taller resale value- based on cheaper parts replacement alone. The other bonus was : who can tell the difference between a early Ghost and the later version?? Lets' see.... $120,000 for a really nice, used one versus $331,000 (with tax and options) for the late ones. Then again, maybe you'd rather have a cookie-cutter [non-permissible content removed] Wagon? Mmmm, seemed like an easy choice to me. 
Folks that toss Barb's~ never owned one. Whether you're a 'Poser', or not, the Rolls-Royce simply IS the Epitome of Class, Quality, and Prestige, setting you in top spot every where you drive. I've been showered with compliments just about every time I park it. To sum it up: You ""Get What You Pay For""....and more. It was a no-brainer for me.

rolls-royce,ghost,2011,Duane, 03/09/2017,Rolls Royce Ghost - Worlds BEST Luxury Car!!!!,5,"If you want ultimate luxury you can drive, then look no further.  Rolls Royce Ghost is in a class of its own! The fit and finish is like nothing you have ever seen. The driving experience is amazing. You will not want to get out. Drive one and you will see. Driving it is like floating on a magic carpet.

Much higher quality than my Bentley.  Every thing this car does it does well.  Very elegant, reliable, stately and easy to drive.

rolls-royce,phantom-drophead-coupe,2008,Matt, 10/01/2008,It could be WAY better,2,"If you are a person that loves luxury features like a voice-activated navigation system, 12-disc CD/DVD changer, massaging seats, voice- activated 14-way seats, voice- activated heat / air conditioning in car, adaptive cruise control, universal cell phone reception, and remote start, you will love this Phantom Convertible, which contains all of the above, and then some. Even though it's 6,000 pounds, it gets to 60mph in 5.4 seconds, which is not terribly impressive, but it is ridiculously impressive for such a huge car. Fuel economy is that of a World War II battleship, and it's still overpriced by a good $100,000, but it's a decent (not anything special) car if you have the money."
rolls-royce,phantom-drophead-coupe,2008,shai-shai88, 02/06/2009,Wow,4,"I bought a Rolls Royce Phantom Drophead coupe becauce I was tried of driving a Lexus. So I went to Clearwater to check out the Phantom, but the price was way high so I went there 5 months later and bought the Phantom coupe for 407,342 dollars and the Phantom drives so smooth it's like your driving on air. I love my rolls Royce!"
rolls-royce,phantom-drophead-coupe,2008,Mike, 02/06/2009,"Not a bad car, all considering",3,"I drive my drophead to work and back and in traffic it performs ok. I had some trouble getting the stereo right but the manual helped out--not as easy as you'd think! I'd recommend the car but definately think about getting the brushed hood--make a big difference.  Not decided however about the leather options.  Maybe eggshell would have been better but I'm pretty happy... LOL!  Don't bother going to the store with it, etc, since storage isn't all that for groceries and such. Suitcases, if you're travelling these days would be better since they don't go up so high.  The drink holder are excellent. Perfect for the big gulp to the frappacino."
rolls-royce,phantom-drophead-coupe,2010,Wheelman4000, 08/29/2010,Skip the drophead coupe!,4,"The drophead coupe is like it looks like in the pictures. A phantom ewb hardtop but a convertible. Do not buy a rolls convertible. 1, total waste of money. 2, it gets dirty easily because the interior is meant to be covered.  3, rarely any of the colors that you can choose for the exterior look good with the shape of the car (see if you go to Rolls Royce dealership.) And lastly, TERRIBLE gas mileage (as all rolls have.) The size of the vehicle makes the car worse. "
rolls-royce,phantom-drophead-coupe,2010,rrowner, 10/06/2020,Phantom drophead is simply the best,5,"Car is absolutely a dream.   My Phantom drophead is now 10 years old and still looks and performs as new.   Sometimes, it is actually too smooth.   One day on the highway when I thought I was driving close to the speed limit and I looked down and I was going 40 MPH over the highway limit.  Over the 10 years (all under either original factory or provenance warranty) the only actual repair was an electronic door handle that sometimes did not work properly and this occurred in the 10th year of service.   Ignore the comments from people who have never owned one."

porsche,718-boxster,2017,BruceJ, 07/29/2016,My first Porsche (updated),5,"I bought one of the first 718's available, though not on purpose.  I was shopping for a used Boxster but the 718 looks so much better and it's so much faster, it was very hard to resist.  I have a base model with ""only"" about 20K in options - PDK, wheels, nav, lighting upgrades, and the premium package.  The purchasing experience at Sunset Imports was very pleasant and quite easy.  I've driven it about 1000 miles so far so it's not even broken in yet, but this is easily the best car I've ever had the pleasure of driving.

(Update) I've now had the car for most of a year, and have joined the local chapter of the Porsche Club.  The 718 continues to delight me, even when it's sitting in the garage waiting for the snow to melt.  It's rock solid, with no issues or trouble at all, and a pure joy to drive.  I've taken it on several long road trips and find that it gets better gas mileage the faster you go.  Who would have guessed? :)   I can't recommend this car enough.  Drive one and you'll see.

porsche,718-boxster,2017,Steve, 02/10/2017,Black Magic box,5,"This is my third Porsche and this one is the best. Performance and road handling are better than a new corvette and $20k less. Fuel economy is better than the 13 model. I test drove the new corvette, the BMW, and the Porsche was much better on ride comfort, controls, handling. We use this vehicle on long trips due to not only being fun to drive, but the fuel economy and comfort are the most important to us. The local service from Porsche is first rate compared to other dealers autos (corvette dealer is terrible). If you buy a Porsche you won't be disappointed.

porsche,718-boxster,2017,Sean C, 09/16/2017,7th Heaven in 718S Boxster,5,"I purchased my 2017 718S Boxster in May of 2017. This is my 7th Porsche since 1991. I have had 4 911's, 1 Panamera E-Hybrid S and 1 2003 Boxster. My 2017 718S Boxster is the best so far. It is amazing how Porsche continues to improve every model of car they build. I am very impressed with the performance of the 4 cyl 2.5L Turbo of the 718 S and the fuel economy is fantastic. My most previous Porsche was a 2006 Carrera S Tip. up until this current car, was my favorite.  was great as well as reliability. I had 90K on it when I sold it and bought my 718S. We decided that we wanted a convertible and with the new styling and improved performance, and fuel economy of the 718, it was a no brainer. The PDK transmission is amazing, fast and perfect. The handling is unparalleled to any car in its class. I don't use it as a weekend car, but drive it on a regular basis. I bought it in May and have 6K on the car now and it is glorious. Id recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic performing sports car that is great looking, fast and fuel efficient. 5 Stars all the way Porsche! Keep it going!!!

porsche,718-boxster,2017,David S, 10/14/2018,I'm not sold on the Base model,4,"My 2010 Base was in the shop for major maintenance so I got to drive this Boxster around for three days.  After those three days, I was mostly happy to get my older Boxster back.  My '17 Boxster had a number of options including 20"" wheels and PDK.  I have a number of gripes with the car: 1) acceleration isn't linear.  The turbo kick reminded me a bit of a Saab 900 Turbo. 2) The view out back is greatly restricted.  What happened to the rear window? 3) The engine sound is atrocious, like a chain-driven aircooled Beetle met a 2.5L Subaru.  4) Gross absence of storage nooks. // That said, no doubt this car is faster and looks better.  Handling was a tad softer and the steering slightly less communicative. Surprisingly comfy for 20"" wheels. Otherwise, very similar experiences.  I'd like to test a 2.5T or the GTS.  "
porsche,718-boxster,2017,Sean R, 09/17/2018,"4th Boxster, better than ever!",5,"Our Carrera White PDK 718 Boxster S is our 4th Boxster and without a doubt the best overall Boxster yet. The biggest difference in the new series is the motor. The sound is less compelling at lower RPM’s  but the power is intoxicating throughout the rev range. The 981/982 series has always felt more refined vs the 987 series and with that a bit less connected at times. Perhaps it’s lightening of parts that’s lost a certain heft to things like the doors closing or the switch to electric  steering. There’s a smoothed out refined demeanor that translates to a smoothness in effort on the road along with a maturity about the cars. The new 718 has taken that to the next level of refined sofistication and driving excellence. It’s next to impossible not to be smooth and enjoy this car when driving a backroad. The interior and exterior are subjectively the best looking yet. All in all we are very pleased with this next genation and it really rounds out what one expects or needs in a sports car.
"
porsche,718-boxster,2017,Jeff Berger, 10/31/2018,Boxster 718,5,"Much better acceleration then two models back. Great acceleration at higher speeds too. Top speed of 170 mph with 0 - 60 in 4.9 seconds. PDK is faster 4.2 and 177mpg, but i love stick. Those glorious cup holders are still there. Enough space in back and front trunks. Bluetooth integration easy. Garage door opener can be programmed easily too. Love the new body style, more elegant, sporty and aggressive looking. Don’t have navigation, as I like Siri via Maps, and Sirius Satellite was free for three months but I never renewed as I didn’t use it. Careful as the front air damn is extremely close to the ground. Be careful in driveways and dips. I don’t have break assist to speak to. The only thing I should have gotten is automatic mirror retraction and side and rear view mirror dimming. The value of the car dropped precipitously at the year and year and a half marks, but this is expected in a new sports car. Basically it’s art! I rated a lot of catagories with “ok” as 5 Stars, but this just meant those attributes didn’t matter to me or didn’t apply. So, as you can tell, the only negatives for me are low front airdamn, road traction to a slight degree (I do tend to drive quickly), depreciation and, I forgot, mileage is better than the previous model but is still so so.

porsche,718-boxster,2017,Jack, 11/16/2018,Silver bullet!!!!,5,"I bought my 2017 718 S with 6,500 miles. $21,000 below sticker price. It is a beautiful unbelievable driving machine. My advice to anyone looking for a Boxster is to search the market for low mileage pre owned. Lot of fun and so rewarding to lock a deal down. I love this car and will have for years. PDK is so fast and fun!!!!
"
porsche,718-boxster,2018,David , 08/11/2019,A Perfect Sports Car!,5,"I always wanted a car only for me that provides speed, power, agility yet comfortable and quiet on the road and found all the above attributes in the Boxster GTS! Before purchasing this white with red top and red leather interior, I drove a Corvette GS, Mercedes C63S, Mercedes E53, 911 4S Cabriolet but none came close to giving me feeling of closeness and quick reflex of the Boxster GTS. This car feels like perfectly fitted leather gloves. The car feels like a part of me. Because of luxury items and extra cargo space, I was about buy a fully equipped E53; however, it just did not corner and moved like Boxster GTS. The Corvette GS was quick and sounded great but I felt like I was stuck in a bathtub and it was too big. C63S was powerful with awesome sound from the engine but it was too rough, unrefined in its way of moving. Porsche 4S was quick, smooth and moved with grace but just did not feel as intimate and close fitting as Boxster GTS; it felt big and is whole lot bigger than its little brother Boxster. The Boxster GTS is the sports car of my dream. 
"
porsche,718-boxster,2018,Mtaylor, 01/08/2021,Great car despite the terrible dealer experience,5,"Sublime handing, comfortable, much faster than expected, this is simply the best toy car I have ever owned.  It is unfortunate that the dealer fraudulently used my social security number and personal information to sell other cars.  I am still fighting with credit agencies to get my good name back more than a year later.
"
porsche,718-cayman,2017,Phil, 12/10/2016,Where has this car been all my life?!?!,5,"Let's get the disclaimer out of the way first; this is my first Porsche, so I can't do the sound comparison - I'm happy, but I can't compare to ""back in the day."" What I can say is that this is one fine, well-built, high performing vehicle. This car simply attracted me, especially after I couldn't find much else that appealed to me. Several makes and models seemed to be going for luxury at the expense of performance. I've always preferred cars that I drove, rather than ones that drove me. And those were getting increasingly difficult to find. I've always driven manual transmissions, and several ""sport sedans"" and even ""sport cars"" were abandoning them. So I plunked down a deposit in mid-July, knowing I wouldn't get it until around the first of December. It was worth the wait. Is the Porsche 718 Cayman inexpensive? No. But it's also not cheap, either. This is a well put together car with very good materials. It has an intelligent layout that is pretty darn intuitive and easy to understand. It has the smoothest shifting of any of my previous ten cars. I'd always wondered if a car can really feel like ""it corners on rails""; now I know one can. The handling of this car, and its responsiveness, is what I'd dream about if I dreamed about ""the ultimate car."" I wanted a car that would be just plain fun to drive on meandering country roads, and now I've got it. We've all had that one car we felt connected to - I had mine in my late 20s. But this Cayman looks like it will rival, and likely surpass, that connection. I suspect that in a very short time I will know what the car will do, and it will know what I'm up to. I've only had that one other car that generated that level of trust. And the look of this car is stunning (and with better lines than the previous Caymans). Also, a plug for Sun Motor Cars in Pennsylvania, an excellent dealership, is in order. So let's sum it up: looks, handling, the fun quotient, comfort, acceleration, a (gasp!) car with a manual transmission, that feeling of connection, a car that exudes thoughtful class and excellence - yes, this new Cayman checks all the boxes for me. One. Fine. Vehicle.
"
porsche,718-cayman,2017,smerdyakov, 12/02/2016,718: there is no substitute,4,"Having been interested in Porsche for many years, I began reading reviews of the new 718 series as soon as they began to appear. I finally got the chance to drive one (a base Boxster) about a month ago, and I was very impressed: it was superior in every respect to the 2014 Boxster S that I was driving. After thinking it over for a while, I returned to my dealer last week, and drove the base car again, followed by an S. I was again impressed by the base car, but the S clearly had higher performance. Having had a Boxster, I decided to buy a Cayman this time: better visibility, the ability to take it through a car wash, getting away from troublesome sun glare with the top down and less expensive. My dealer (Checkered Flag in Virginia Beach) gave me an outstanding deal, and I bought my new Cayman S on 11-29-16. If you have read reviews that whine about the noise of the new 
engines, ignore them: the new engines have a bass note that is very satisfying. The 718 is also superior to its predecessor in every respect - better steering, better ride, better handling, better acceleration. I am very pleased, as anyone will be who is looking for the quintessential sports car.
Update, 12-2-18. After having this car for 18 months, I got very tired of it. The instruments were hard to read, the controls were hard to see and use safely, and the blurpblurp engine noise got to be very tiresome. In addition, an oxygen sensor sailed after only 2,000 miles. Overall, a nice car, but I will never buy another. I traded it for an Audi TT RS, which is a much better car.
"
porsche,718-cayman,2017,smrt50, 02/05/2017,"Wow, I love my New Porsche Cayman S",5,"I've owned an Porsche Panamera 4 for several years, but decided  to trade it in for the new 2017 Porsche Cayman S.  One word, ""WOW"", this vehicle is a totally Amazing. I enjoyed my Panamera 4, but driving the Cayman S will put a Smile on your face for hours. This vehicle is responsive, amazingly fast, and you'll fall in Love on the test drive.  I researched this vehicle for several months and the reviews were excellent.  After owning my Cayman S for 3 weeks, I have to agree with the Five Star reviews.  I love everything about this car, the ride, handling, responsiveness, comfort, and true Porsche Driving experience.  I thought I would miss my Panamera 4, but once I got behind the wheel of my new Cayman S only one word comes to mind, ""Wow""."
porsche,718-cayman,2017,Thomas E. Ostberg, 03/20/2018,Great Performance,5,"A wonderfully performing two-seater, with an excellent sound system by Bose.  Has superior handling, particularly at speed, and acceleration above sixty miles-per-hour is phenomenal.  The engine can be a bit loud during acceleration, but the sound is terrific.

porsche,718-cayman,2017,Jack, 11/15/2018,2017 718 Cayman S,4,"Costs for maintenance seem pretty high, but it is a Porsche.  Cost of the car was fine, it's when you start adding options. Yikes!   Great car, fun to drive.  Sounds OK, but not a beast like the flat 6.
"
porsche,718-cayman,2017,Shannon Roe, 12/18/2019,Best handling SportsCar,5,"She’s got curves, turns heads, accelerates quickly and will be every bit as good to you as you are to her... the Cayman 718 is a goddess. Take her on a back toad, sling her around a few curves and you’ll realize you just met your plus one, your soul mate, your better half. Do yourself a favor and buy the car.

porsche,718-cayman,2018,willy j, 09/18/2020,"Had many options, but chose the Porsche 718",5,"Glad I opted for this brand and model.  Well made; high quality comfortable to drive for me and my wife; and sufficiently fast.  Handles like a slot car on steroids.  The PDK transmission is impressive.  Unless you run 10,000 mile annually, I would not purchase the maintenance package--not worth the cost.
"
porsche,718-cayman,2019,Smerdyakov, 08/09/2019,Porsche is right - there is no substitute,5,"In 2018 I bought an Audi TT RS, which I thought was nearly perfect. That feeling lasted until I drove a high mileage 2012 Cayman R a few days ago. I was very surprised by how superior the driving experience was to my Audi.
Two days later I bought a well optioned 2019 base Cayman with PDK, which felt very similar to the old R that I had driven. I bought a base car rather than an S because the performance is outstanding, more than sufficient for my needs, and it was much less expensive. I am delighted with it, and have resolved to never again buy any sports car but a Porsche. Excellence is expected, and always delivered.

porsche,911,2000,enriver, 09/30/2014,"Best Porsche I ever owned, before my newer one.",5,"Fast and responsive -This Carrera is the best Porsche I have ever owned, it is quick, agile and and feels completely safe on any surface. Gone is the extreme over-steer and the front end lift under acceleration, and at 0-60 in 4.1 seconds, the 997.2 is nothing to sneer at.  I bought this Porsche in 2015 with 9,000 miles, it looks new, it feels new and it is very well maintained and a pleasure to polish. Much maligned by the snobs who call themselves ""purists"" and no more IMS and RMS fear mongering with the new cam drive design. No additional oil between changes.
"
porsche,911,2000,Rob, 05/04/2010,No substitute!,4,"Have owned car about a year, purchased used with 50k on it. Had original window sticker and records. Always wanted a 911 since I was a kid 30 years ago, but fearful of cost of owning a performance German car, but wish I had done it years ago. Awesome driving car, a solid rock. Bullet like acceleration, brakes that stop on a dime and give 9 cents change, on rails handling, visceral exhaust noise. Classic style that will never be mistaken for some pseudo Asian competition. This car is addictive to drive. I find myself always taking the long route home."
porsche,911,2000,Joe, 10/13/2010,Nothing better,4,"I bought this car 5 years ago - speed yellow with black top, and then 28,000 miles. It's almost 11 years old now with 60,000 miles.   No one believes it.   These are phenomenally fun, well- built and fast cars.   I drive mine daily and thoroughly enjoy it.   By far the most satisfying car I've ever owned (and I've owned Mercedes, Audi, Lexus, Toyota, etc...)  There is no doubt that the only thing that will replace it will be a newer 911 convertible - hopefully a Turbo.   In a word - you need one!    "
porsche,911,2000,KaptHero, 10/02/2009,Great Car!!!,4,"I picked this car up used, one owner, 48,000 Miles and it's been a dream.  No oil leaks to speak of, mechanically sound. This is a great daily or just weekend driver.  I change my own oil for under $50 and that is with a K&N Filter and Mobil 1."
porsche,911,2000,New Porschephile, 01/30/2004,Not just a toy,4,"I had never owned a high end sports 
performance car.  This was definitely a 
step up from the Japanese ones I 
previously owned and the newer ones on 
the current market.  Initially, looked 
at buying a Maserati Spyder with F1.  
Oddly another customer at the Ferrari 
dealership recommended trying Porsche 
and I have not looked back.  I thought 
this would be a car that sat in the 
garage to maintain its value with low 
mileage.  I can't stop driving it 
though, taking it to work everyday, 
routine shopping, long-distance trips, 
and sometimes just for fun.  It has 
been a pleasure to drive.  The kids 
want to ride in it all the time as well."
porsche,911,2000,Seamus, 05/13/2002,Two years in,4,"This is my first Porsche.  On the 
whole I am pleased with the car and 
would consider buying another (likely 
a Turbo as I really feel the car needs 
another 50+ hp).  Reliability is 
fairly good although I and many other 
996 owners have had new rear main oil 
seals.  The last factory ECU tune 
downloaded at service now has the 
check engine light flashign on and off."
porsche,911,2000,Gary, 08/04/2018,"Favorite hot wheel as a kid, favorite car at 50.",5,"Waited 3 years to give fair review for this car.  My biggest fear in purchasing this car was cost of maintenance. After 3 years and 28k of spirited driving😀 I love this car. No expensive parts to buy because nothing breaks. I took it 1500 miles south then back with no issues. Owned many sports cars over the years but nothing drives like this. Look forward to running errands. Very drive able in town, and over 4k rpms always bring a rush and roar. Worst I can say about this car is the plastic interior parts could be better. And if that's the worst thing on a car buy it.

porsche,911,2000,Greg Adams, 12/07/2019,Love for a maligned automobile.,5,"My car, a 2000 C2 has been my faithful companion. Before buying a car like this, one must understand that maintenance is costly. That said, I'm happy for the exchange between enjoying my sixth Porsche...most of which were great cars had issues of their own. The 996 in its raw form is what Ferdinand Porsche originally believed the evolution of the brand would eventually evolve into. The older cars have issues, this particular car has issues. At the end of the day its all about smiles for miles. My car is a daily driver. Since I've purchased it, the car has had its foibles, nothing major but significantly less the my Ferrari's in the past. Personal opinion....the haters of the look of this car lack appreciation of artistic form meetings exceptional performance. I could go on, but I think I'll go for a drive."
porsche,911,2000,Dan H, 01/06/2018,Great till the engine seizes,4,"I was a victim of a catotrophic engine failure of a 2002 Porsche 911.the car had 65k on it and I DID the IMS bearing fix and clutch replacement while I was at it.

porsche,911,2000,Thomas, 01/16/2006,"If you can Afford One, Buy It",4,"I have had several air cooled Porsche 911's and this first water cooled auto is a blast to drive and own.  It has great handling and awesome excelleration through the gears.  It can easily handle the C4 Corvettes and most of the tricked out Hondas and Subarus that aren't too tuned up.  I don't waste the gas on the new 350ZX's that pull up and want to go at it.  A lot of people tailgate you out of jealousy, but you get used to it and just slow down to aggravate them.  Through the twisties, nothing out there can keep up with you as long as you stay on the gas pedal, the handling is phenomenal. I am going to sell this car soon and upgrade to a late model 996 Turbo.

porsche,911,2000,JG, 07/07/2009,1st Porshe,4,If you have never owned a Porsche. You should at least once in your life. It is not just a car it is pure man and machine made whole in one. It is perfection. Want to go fast in a straight line buy a Vette; want an experience buy the Porsche.
porsche,911,2000,markmjm, 07/29/2003,"Fun To Drive, When its not leaking",4,"I sold my 95 NSX because it couldn't 
safely accommodate children. My 2000
911, of course, can do this, and it's
more comfortable, it offers more
technology (in terms of safety,
performance, etc.), and it is about as
much fun to drive. However, despite
good JD Power reliability ratings I have
been disappointed. With only 6000 easy
miles on the odometer, I've had to deal
with 3 oil leaks -- a pinched O-ring, a
leaky valve cover, and in the past few

On the 1 or 2 occasions where I thought about selling it, I've only had to go and drive it for a few miles and I've come back with a smile on my face.  It's hard to believe that it could be improved on.  The only problems I've had have been with the top was not working correctly when I first got the car.  The performance, handling styling and overall experience of ownership have been above my expectations.  I would absolutely buy another Carrera."

porsche,911,2000,DLH, 06/24/2017,I never thought I would own one.,5,"The 996 gets a lot of criticism and I think a lot of that comes from being an easy target because it's a Porsche.  It's like nothing else I've ever driven. There is no practical reason for it to exist and I'd like top thank all of the Porsche enthusiasts for allowing it to exist. I haven't had a motorized method of transport that makes me smile like this since my friend killed my old jet ski. It's the go kart your mom wouldn't let you have as a kid. I never thought a naturally aspirated flat six could be this good. 300 horsepower isn't a big deal in modern cars but the difference is you get to use all 300 horsepower. It's incredibly well built, it's immediately apparent that it was made by true craftsman. It goes like stink all the way to the redline and the sound is delightful. The manual transmission is excellent and the visibility is unmatched by modern vehicles. It's one of the last lightweight cars and it begs to be driven hard. Yes the headlights are awful, the interior is nothing special, the radio is confusing and you have to do a preemptive IMS fix. But I don't care what anyone else thinks, I love it.

intoxicating, as is rolling through a 
slow-speed zone in first or second

problem is lack of a cup holder. One 
MAJOR problem is that every 20 year 
old idiot in a honda will tailgate 
you, as well the 'never will afford a 
real car' minivan driving middle age 
losers (male and female). Cannot tell 
you how many times I have been driving 
merrily along and some MORON pulls up 
next to me and starts revving his 
engine: especially contractors in

unbelievebly good. I just re-tread

porsche,911,2000,morris944, 03/28/2006,Pure exitment,4,This is definitely a great purchase.  This car is fun to drive and I can't find enough reasons to drive it.  Its horsepower and torque have a nice balance.  The only complaint is the suspension.  It is too soft for such a performance vehicle.  A stiffer suspension would give this car more predictability.  However the PSM certainly compensates for it.

Its a C4 with the sports package. The C4 corners better than either Audi and there is nothing to compare to the freeing feeling of driving the Porsche with the top down! I have replaced the sound system and added navigation and a radar detector. The car now has 60k mi on it and I have not had one mechanical problem.The battery had to be replaced once and general maintenance that's it! The Audis have had numerous problems and they are both years younger. You cannot beat the elegance, classic style, performance, and reliability of this piece of art!"

It had 118,000km on it when I bought it and two years later I've put on another 50,000km.  Its fast, sexy, comfortable, built to last a lifetime, quite practice and oh so much fun!  We've take it on long road trips, to the cottage, to get groceries, fishing... you get the idea.  With just an engine chip and a few little things it runs 11.7 @ 120 MPH in the 1/4 mile... plus when the snow flies the AWD makes it   I've owned a lot of nice cars and I'm convinced this is automotive perfection.  Timeless design and these things are only going to be going up in value - just look at the 911 Turbo's of the past.  "

porsche,911,2001,DIC_CAMARILLO, 12/27/2007,"If you can afford it, get one",4,"This is our 4th Porsche (2nd water cooled) and its the best we've ever owned.  The power is exceptional.  Handling is superb.  Comfortable to drive - great seats.  This car looks fabulous.  I recommend the non-turbo for a few reasons.  The Carrera is lighter, has a true Porsche feel and you can get an extended warranty - should be purchased.  The Turbo is incredible, but the all wheel drive takes some of the challenges out of driving.  I like the feeling of knowing where the traction limits are.  I think this is what makes a 911 such a fun car to drive.  The tail gets a little loose, but not like the older 993 and 911.  If you're going to drive this car hard, you need to pay attention.  "
porsche,911,2001,Tod Hayes, 06/14/2018,A 911 You Can Afford to Drive,5,"The Porsche 996 was the first water-cooled 911 and it generated and continues to generate controversy.  It is definitely a love-in-or-hate-it  proposition.  The car is powerful, fast, and handles very well.  It is well built and solid — with the possible exception of the materials used on the interior.  However, a small percentage of these cars have experienced catastrophic breakdowns resulting from a failure of its intermediate shaft bearing.  Porsche has settled a class-action brought on behalf of Porsche owners of the affected cars, but some people complain that not all affected Porsches were included in the class.  In any event, a person planning to purchase this car should determine whether or not the car has had remedial action taken with the intermediate shaft bearing and, if not, factor that into the price.  There are fixes for the IMS issue and, indeed, cars that are run regularly and do not sit don’t seem as likely to experience the problem.  In this writer’s opinion, the issues only have the effect of making the car more affordable for those who want to own and drive one.

My 996 can be driven at 35 MPH on city streets all day long.  Or on the freeway at 65 MPH.  Then I downshift and push the pedal!  This car is phenomenal!  Suspension can be tricky on corners at high speed.  Great feedback.  Insane braking.  Comfortable to drive.  Bose stereo is very nice for a small car like this.  Definitely get one if you can afford it! "

I found a cherry '01 manual with only 26k on the clock, all original with removable hardtop. My daily driver is a '09 BMW 335i coupe auto. That car, as great as it is, does not draw compliments like the 911.  It's a statement to how timeless the design really is.  Surprising the 911 is just as fast as my 8 year newer BMW.  At today's prices the 996 are a super bargain right now. My friends thought it was new.  I suggest searching out a good example, park it in the garage and drive it for another 10 years.  "

porsche,911,2001,Foxtrot X-ray, 09/04/2010,German Supermodel,4,"Car-girl analogies are a bit cliche but my experience with the 911 turbo is like a regular guy dating a German Supermodel.  The first date is an intimidating experience that makes you feel twitchy, nervous, and out of place. After some time together, it becomes apparent that the supermodel is very special but also a ""regular girl"" with a wonderful personality. You do not have to drive fast to have fun in the turbo. With the windows down and the sunroof open you can hear the purr of the twin turbo flat 6 and you can't help but feel happy. I think I am beginning to understand the reasons behind the Porsche 911's legendary reputation."

Passengers might complain about the very firm ride; but I am all smiles as I straighten every curve! My only real complaint is the Porsche tax, which makes the Mercedes tax look reasonable. However, this car has been the most reliable German car that I've owned. The rear main seal failed at 99,500 miles (replaced under 100,000 mile warranty), the ignition key housing cracked (not a warranty item), I replaced the clutch when the rear main seal failed, the cooling system leaked twice, and the ac condenser had to be replaced. This is car is not an Infiniti. Otherwise, routine maintenance. "

These vehicles are not cheap to maintain, but once you tackle the pricier repairs/replacements, they are ROCK SOLID and want to be driven daily.  I live in the Northeast, so I only have her out Spring to Fall, but I drive the hell out of her during those months.

I have power memory seats which I recommend.  The CD player is good, but skips a little.  The Bose stereo system sounds very good.  It has a gorgeous body with nicely flared out rear fenders.  The Litronic HID lights look great and shine a nicely focused beam of light down the road.  Now for the good stuff!  Its acceleration is strong through the power band, the car will push you back in your seats.  The engine sings as its RPMs increase to red line!  The shifter is precise and I love how when it's in neutral, it sits right between 3rd and 4th - you can't mis-shift.  It corners like shes on rails.  The brakes are amazing."

It handles like a race car but is a great daily driver.  The performance is great and I love the looks.  I keep trying to buy a Vette but have ended up with 2 Porsches.  The dealership here is great and I'm in the Porsche club now. My Porsche experience has been positive.  Repairs and maintenance aren't cheap but keeping a fine sports car in perfect shape is worth it.  One fall day with the top down on a curvy mountain road is something you can't describe.  I recommend Porsches.  
porsche,911,2001,spamjuice, 10/30/2008,"WOW, now this is a sports car!",4,"After sending away my 2004 M3, I bought my 2001 911 Turbo and what a difference that was.  This car will give you goose bumps in the turns, acceleration, the roar of the rear engine and in braking.  It even looks fast at the stop light!  I have to admit, it took me a little time to adjust to the rear weight bias, but overall, the car is very manageable. I only dared to switch the PSM off every now and then. Everything is fantastic in the car, the interior with the curves look more Italian than German. Never had a problem with it so far, built like a tank. "

You get just what you want and expect from a true sports car: a rough ride, phenomenal handling, great acceleration, and the alluring tune of the Porsche Boxer engine.

Whether it is a drive up to the cottage, a cross country trip to the East Coast (2,500 km), competing in Targa Newfoundland, taking it to Mosport for track days or going out for groceries this car delivers whatever is required.  The running costs of the car aren't excessive and insurance wasn't a killer (one of the benefits of middle age).  Five years after buying it I'm still surprised at how much fun it is and how great it looks.  If you're a car fan you owe it to yourself to get into one of these if you can.

There is absolutely no comparison between this car and any other 911. This is like driving a Ferrari. Only superbikes can keep up.  It will put a huge grin on your face shortly followed by a loud YAHOO!  I love it.  I've had 911's for about seven years and this car for just under two years.  The prices are very reasonable these days on used turbos. Go for it. I wouldn't recommend buying new, the depreciation in the first two years is brutal."
porsche,911,2001,Al Temail, 11/25/2005,911 Turbo rocks,4,"If you have the money and you want to experience real performance, try the 911 Turbo. The car is almost too fast for the streets of Dallas, you need plenty of room when you get into it because in a flash you'll be at 85 and there's huge upside from there. If I don't hit 110 everyday (even for a moment) it's a sad day. There are plenty of reasonably priced mods that you can do to increase performance - if you need it. Bear in mind there is a Porsche tax which means the same part for BMW will cost 50% less and the same part for a Mercedes will cost 30% less. As the saying goes, speed costs money, how fast can you afford to go? "
porsche,911,2001,vvassallo, 06/10/2006,No Worries Performance,4,"After 5 months with the car, I can say it is pretty awesome.  This is the most value for your money in supercars if you buy a low mileage 2001.  Its handling stock is decent, but a bit mushy - coil over upgrades take care of that.  There's plenty of HP on tap to embarrass all but the most exotica on the road.  Get a warranty.  Parts and maintenance are better priced than Ferrari, but stout.  This car's most dangerous trait is how it accelerates like a missile before you know it.  PSM keeps it tame in the twisties.  It's not a Ferrari, but it's pretty close.  The wow factor is not as much as you might like if you crave attention though."

While many snuffed the new looks of the 996 chassis and design, it's unmistakably all 911... and the performance on and off the track are testimony to it's heritage.  There are some weak points mechanically in some cars, but this is factored in to the low prices we're seeing for these models.  2002 added some nice goodies - and it's a great year...  Would I love a 2009 997?  Perhaps, but when you might be able to pay cash for a 2002 with only incrementally lower performance (but less weight, too), it's an easy decision."
porsche,911,2002,Jonas, 01/01/2009,Awesome Targa!!,4,"I frequently change vehicles and have had some of the greats in the mid- price range - Elise, NSX, S2000.  The 911 edges out the NSX for top honors in my opinion.  It gives an unbelievably smooth ride when calm, but upon hard acceleration or cornering tightens up significantly.  This is the first of the cars I've owned that my wife will drive.  I've only had the car for a few months, but it hasn't missed a beat.  Also, the torque curve is much more linear than any car I've previously owned.  It's a welcoming contrast to the lack of bottom end power I've experienced in the past.  In my opinion the Targa design is far superior to the standard 911; the glass breaks up the roof line nicely."

There is nothing like a 911, especially a rag top with the top down. I bought a museum quality car and keep it that way as a pleasure  car. When I take it out I feel the bit of celebrity a Porsche 911 brings to the road. I love the power top and the complex way the rear deck comes up to hide it, but it squeaks when going up and down and has a small intermittent rattle. No real problem. Hope to own a 911 until I die and would be buried in one but it would be a shame to deprive someone else of the pleasure of driving the car.   "

The reliability of my Targa has been horrible, and the interior rattles as if it is going to fall apart. The interior design is a joke, and the ergonomics are even worse. There are a lot of little things wrong with the interior that show a lack of car, spaces that shouldn't be there, misspellings in the display, tape holders without tape, and nothing is easy to find.  A BMW M3 offers the same performance for half the price, half the insurance, and half the maintenance. What was I thinking? "

awe of this car and company has been 
crushed.  Although the car is fun to 
drive fast, quality is atrocious.  
I've had the car in for 4 major engine 
repairs, including 3 repairs of the 
rear main seal.  The car has now been 
at the shop over 2 weeks having its 
engine replaced.  Porsche has made no 
efforts to replace car."
porsche,911,2002,Fred Hill, 04/10/2002,"Porsche, there is no substitute",4,"In January, I traded my 911 C4 for a 
2002 Turbo, Seal Gray with black 
interior.  It is fast, beautiful, fun to 
drive and the best handling sports 
car I have ever driven.  
The extra money is worth the extra 
kick of getting in my car."
porsche,911,2002,NotRealHappy, 09/04/2002,Broken Down,2,"I love the look of the car and to drive 
it.  However, build quality is very 
poor - from the cheap materials inside, 
to the rattles all over, and ultimately 
to the machanical breakdowns.  My car 
has 2200 miles . . . it broke down on 
the highway this weekend and is in the 
the shop waiting for a ""minor"" part - a 
new engine.  Seems mine developed a 
small block crack that requires a total 
replacement.  Clearly, this is not the 
things of great cars!  Porsche needs to 
focus on quality."
porsche,911,2002,Estrid, 10/08/2003,Good but Not Great,4,"Fun to drive, head turning car. Broke 
camshaft at 2000 miles after perfect 
break in. Dealer replaced engine. 
Engine misses when hot at low rpm and 
oil pressure can fluctuate at sustained 
rpm. Dealer says computer diagnostics 
show everything normal. Alignment was 
incorrect from purchase date despite 
dealership review after 200 miles. 
Alignment now correct and handling is 
vastly improved. Even after the 
headaches, it may be the best 
performance and looks for the money."
porsche,911,2002,Another New Yorker, 11/14/2002,This car is good but not a legend !,3,"I live in Manhattan and drive maybe once
a week, probably much less in winter.
The Porsche has a problematic battery
that drains quite fast unless the engine
is idled or the car is driven at least
several times a week. I did not have the
time to go and rev the engine every day
and so went into battery problems.

You can not stop the battery drain by
disconnecting the battery. For safety
reasons,the doors do not open if you
disconnect the battery so there is no
option but watch the battery drain !

So...? I had to sell my car. Be aware
and alert of this problem. Porsche and
numerous magazines that claim to
""review"" cars will not mention such
facts to you."

porsche,911,2002,Giovanni B., 03/03/2009,An unexpected Pleasure,4,"Always fun to drive, even after 7+ years of ownership. I would recommend buying a set of winter tires to anyone who lives in a cold climate, especially if you expect to drive in snow regularly. Without them, the garage is the best place for the car! However, with a set of snows traction becomes very good & driving confidence climbs considerably. This is my ONLY car and I use it in all sorts of nasty weather. I don't baby it at all."
porsche,911,2002,Jim Sommers, 06/16/2005,Surprise Surprise,4,"I've had this car for nearly 4 years. It has about 30K miles on it. When I bough it I was quite prepared to pamper it, have it constantly looked after and treat it more as a ""weekend fun machine."" I've done none of these things. It's as reliable as anything I've ever owned (mostly Hondas, Toyotas, etc. in recent years). I've done nothing except change oil & tires and it's my only car. I use it all year - including cold, with snow winter where the only sacrifice I make is using winter tires. The gas mileage has been a respectable 24+MPG during the entire time so far. Yeah, this is all that ""practical"" stuff supposedly not of interest to someone into these kind of goodies-read on"
porsche,911,2002,DP, 09/19/2006,Amazing Machine,5,"After a disasterous experience with a Ferrari, I returned to Porsche but wanted something more aggressive than my previous 2002 996.  After seeing the depreciation hit the GT-2s had taken, I bought one with 9,000 miles on it.  It is an amazing car, no issues, starts everytime, doesn't miss a beat.  This one had a Techart exhaust and equal length headers - the power is just insane (made my 355 w/ Tubi seems downright slow in comparison).  Zero to 100, I don't think anything can keep up with this car. Given how cheap these are selling for, I would recommend to anyone who wants something more exotic than the Turbo.  Also, with the low production, it is destined to be a collectible."
porsche,911,2002,Koka, 04/19/2003,It's a chunk of change... But worth it!,5,"This car is perfectly balanced and it 
is pretty much impossible to get it 
off the road.  Difference between 2001 
model and 2002 (and up) is enormous, 
although only 20 hp). Fun to drive 
factor is incredible.  I postponed 
purchase with a year, since I felt it 
was too much money.  And granted, it 
is a chuck of change, but when I test-
drove one, I understood, this car is 
worth it!  My advice: Don't wait until 
your 50+ to get this car, get it while 
you're still young..."

The look of class, success and prestige 
pour from this car. As I drive down the 
windy road, I see 5 Corvettes look in 
envy,but anyone can afford a GM. A Jag 
or I mean Ford pulls up and I smile. 
Then a Mercedes..I mean Mopar pulls in

had the Viper and the Ferrari Modena. 
Viper is fast, but not refined in looks

gorgeous looking car but with 260lb 
torque, the engine roars like a dog in 
heat and the F1 transmission is jerky. 
The 911 Turbo is stupid fast, hugs the 
road and looks beautiful. The comfort 
is far superior to any other super 
sportscar I've owned or test-driven. 
It's no MBZ S-class but for a sports

The exterior speaks for itself.  The

interior design is not beautiful, 
however.
Performance is amazing.  The car pulls 
acceptably from 2000 rpm, strongly from 
3500, and like a rocket over 4300.  
Great exhaust note.  Braking and 
handling are incredible.
Even with all this performance, around 
town the C4S is quiet.  The interior is 
roomy.  The ride is firm but nice.

corrections that porsche should have 
done better at the factory. I do not

relatively neutral , steers like a go-
kart , and the brakes inspire 
confidence. 

But Porsche initial quality is poor. At 
2500 miles , main oil seal replaced 
along with a clutch. Clutch was bad 
from the start. Memory option on seats 
didn't work - dealer had to rewire the 
seats. FM Presets didn't work on the

I was told this was not a common issue with this vehicle and the dealer did not see a history of wheel bearing replacement in the past.  One of the bi-Xenon bulb also had to be replaced last year; it was covered under extended warranty.  It was a good thing I bought extended warranty.

porsche,911,2002,jbarry, 10/19/2006,911 Wundercar,4,"Having owned a number of sports cars over the years, and having lusted after many others, the biggest downside to the 911 is that you no longer lust for anything better. The car does almost everything unbelievably well. The 911 provides race car acceleration and handling, while offering a fairly comfortable ride and interior, a really usable trunk (so you can drive to the store), a wonderful level of fit and finish, excellent gas mileage and reliable performance.

Factory MSRP was over $82K (with destination), but I got it for 40. I had concerns 'cuz of the mileage, but it looked great, everything worked, the leather smelled new and the car rode as solid as a brinks truck. Having used it as a daily driver for 11 months, I can report that handling is phenomenal on a dry road (even with AWD and PSM, the car will spin if pushed in the wet), acceleration is sublime and the brakes are in a class of their own. The tear of the flat-6 when the revs pass 4000 makes the driver feel like he's in a race car. The C4S's gorgeous turbo-style body draws envious stares."
porsche,911,2003,autofahrer1, 03/03/2013,A decade of Porsches are lemons,3,"Forget your prejudices about Porsches and German engineering.
With the 996 and the Boxster (water cooled Porsches for over a decade until 2009) Porsche built and sold a car it knew had a self-destructive intermediate shaft bearing that could easily and without visible warning destroy the engine on any car, and has not issued a recall to correct the design defect.
It has also not recalled the more common leaky main bearing seal.
This is especially egregious because the 996 has the highest gross profit margin of any automobile ever in production. They could have replaced every engine on every 996 sold and still made a handsome profit.

It only had 13K miles when I bought it 5 years old, so essentially I got all the experience the first owner had when it was new at about 1/3 of the original price.  996's, especially the later ones, like this one, are very underrated, mainly because of the different shape of the headlights.  Let me say this - when you're cruising down the road and going through the gears, you're in a Porsche.  Period.  It is still a work of art, a marvel of technology and a high performance race car all rolled into one.  I bought an extended warranty from Easy Care just in case, but haven't had to use it. Great value on quintessential sports car!"

porsche,911,2003,David Cutlip, 09/22/2016,Continuing Pleasure,5,"The research I did found the IMS bearing problem affecting only 4% of the models produced. However if the IMS bearing fails you're looking at a very expensive repair, if not a replacement motor. 
That being said, once ""repaired,"" the car runs ""like a Porsche."" It pulls strong, with anything above 4000 RPM bringing an ear-to-ear smile. The handling is spot on, as expected, from any Porsche auto. I plan to do some ""hot laps"" at the track this season, as that's the only place you can properly drive the car without being arrested!!
Addendum 09/22/2017: I have now driven two different tracks, doing ""hot laps"": High Plains Raceway, Byers, Colo. and Aspen Motor Sports Park, Aspen Colo.
The car ran strong and did NOT disappoint. The drive to/from Denver area to Snowmass added a very pleasurable 1180 miles to the clock. Very comfortable for a long trip and those mountain road curves were made for this car!!!

It does't have exactly the same ferrocious acceleration as my 1998 C2S or my 1993 RS 911, but it is a more forgiving ride.  It is more comfortable around town.  It oozes with a formal, superior luxurious ride.  I have found that if I switch off the PASM control, things get back to the Porsche feel that I am more accustomed to.  This car has the full leather interior option and it feels, looks, and smells great.  I also have the aero kit, it adds a fantastic look to the car."

Look, it's bad enough to worry about an IMS bearing failure destroying your 80k mile engine - what do you do with the car after that? Sell it for parts? What annoys me most is the poor engineering and materials. Broken cup holder, floor mat holders breaking free, brake system overhauls, both rear window regulators fail to 2k a pop, the leaking seal, poor radiator and hose design, cheap plastic interior parts - broken visor cover along with yellow dingy headlight covers which cannot be sanded off. At only 80k miles mind you.  I love the car shape and I can take my kid in the jump seat too, but it seems that with the controlled parts pipeline (no aftermarket) and cheap design, the best option is to sell it and never go back.

You cannot find a better manufacturer

claimed it was a little too notchy in

brand new $19,000 transmission from

porsche,911,2003,Andrew (Max) Maxwell, 07/14/2020,Dream as reality.,5,"Growing up i loved the shape & performance of Porsche 911's, never believing one day that it could be me owning & driving one. For nigh on $40'000 NZ i purchased my 2003  Carrera 996 4S. (A 911, 996 is the factory designation number.)An all wheel drive 2 door coupe this car grips the road. With 8% continual balance to the front wheels rising to a maximum 40% any increase in power on a dry road means this car sticks & accelerates at a blistering speed. A Porsche interior is to be felt. Like the body, it has prestige in its looks yet can handle daily use & still perform. All switches are laid out handily with gauges easy to read with a stick on the steering column simply for menu navigation of the on-board computer  with all parameters of performance & essential data met on a central screen between the 2 main gauges. Though you wouldnt think of a 911 as the apt vehicle for ferrying large bodied persons or acting as a rather stylish Uber its surprising the load that can fit comfortably in the rear area &, as always, front luggage compartment.( think 7 weeks clothes, work paperwork, toiletries & any books, electronics or other necessities needed over covid 19 lockdown). Outside of myself, my car regularly carries an additional passenger with more often that person being 6 foot+. The suspension is all ""sport"" & allows the 4S to perform while making oneself feel that they are merely driving at a rather pedestrian pace. With  this car it pays to flick the eyes over the speedometer with regularity as part of your mirrors casting while concentrating on the road. Its so smooth 140kmh is a speed you could easily find yourself having to draw back from with some regularity excepting the beautiful tone of the dual pair of exhausts acts rather like an aural rpm gauge warning of imminent ticketing possibilities. The engine is classic Porsche, a horizontilly opposed 6 cylinder with 4 overhead cams, its fuel injected though this time water cooled as opposed to the usual air cooled engines Porsche is known for. The engine doesnt suffer for this change though redlining above 7000rpm. It reaches 100km/h in 5.9 seconds with a top speed of 275km/h when coupled with the 5 speed tiptronic automatic. A lack of speed & power through the gears is obviously not lacking but neither is stopping power. ABS is standard with some cars fitted with Porsche ceramic composite brakes, this coupled with the 4S's PSM(Porsche Stability Management) gives the driver outstanding control on cornering & lane holding even with varying friction elements being presented. The 4S is built to the dimensions of the 996 turbo with a wide rear and low stance but surprised me with an overall length of almost 4.5 mtrs with width at 1830mm. The height of 1295mm with rear tyres being 295/30 18's & fronts running 225/40 18's gives a nice solid feel, as well as look, to an already classic body shape & lines. An automatic adjusting rear spoiler, electric windows, mirrors,seats, infrared theft protection system & airbag systems are only some of the additional items that are too many to give justice to in listing, that the Carrera 4S driver has at their command. When getting into my work vehicle (an Isuzu Elf)or most any other vehicle after a stint in the 996, a distinct feeling of knowing what its like to step back into being Clark Kent seems to take over with a commonality of the humdrum that has me jumping straight into my 911 Carrera after work or any chance i get & hitting the open or any road with pleasure. For almost $40'000 i got a car i dreamed of, in reality, that, with the proper servicing schedule, feels like a prestige or ""super""car but with the driveability of an everyday car. Dont ask ""why""?  Say, ""Why not!""
"
porsche,911,2003,Miss High Maintenanc, 11/19/2010,Miss High Maintenance,3,"With respect to reliability, the car has been disappointing: close to $500 to fix a burned out xenon bulb; a failed rear main seal (a universal problem in 996s, 911s built from 1998- 2008, I have since found out, a lemon by any other name); failed sport exhaust cutout; failed radiators and there are 2 of them; increasingly stiff and notchy shifter; fractured dash trim (due to age) etc.  Honoring the warranty has been reasonable. Noise and ride can be intolerable at times. Totally lacking in balanced handling, compared say to a Boxster or Miata, especially dangerous in very high speed curves, when camber and rear weight bias can combine to give it Corvair (or original VW Beetle) characteristics"
porsche,911,2003,Debba, 03/07/2019,Read this if you want to buy it.,1,"I didn't write this before I sold my Porsche. After so many years 1998-2004 car is falling apart: interior and mechanical side: Gaskets, plastic - all bad. Any part will cost you fortune (check ebay). Take Toyota the same year-Toyota is like tank.  IMS bearing - don't worry about it. Clutch is weak: 20K-30K miles and it costs about $3000 to replca it (part is $1000). Bottom line. It is just a cute little car. Only 300 hp. There are many new cars with similar HPs. Pay 20K to impress your neighbors? You want it but you want to sell it. it is very hard to sell it. You can't sell it because people don't have cash in this country. Majority of buyers were over 70 yo. I got to tell them that it is hard to get in and out of this car and it is hard to handle it. Drive it every day? Not comfortable.

I know what a real car is!!!  I swear 
it's more than what you can ever

unbelievable, with the stereo system 
being up there with the best of them!  
Grabs attention like no other car, I 
had a guy pull next to me at a stop

In the 40 years I have been driving my

owned or driven.  The '00 Boxster was 
flawless.  It was never in the shop for

Everybody else on the road is there only for you to pass them. Takes the corners impossibly well. Exterior design that you never get tired of.  I have had Mercedes for many years and I am impressed with the ergonomic design and build quality of Porsche, absolutely on a par with MB (or better).

of solidity and reliability that my 
previous rides did not have.
 Of course the car is tremendously fast 
but it accelerates quietly with very 
little drama. You can find yourself at 
125mph before you know it. The car is 
so capable and solid at high speed that 
it just begs you to go faster.

porsche,911,2004,Jeff w., 12/05/2015,"Best Porsche despite what ""purists"" say",4,"Internet says these cars blow up but it's just not the issue the purists would have you believe.  Stories stem from early IMS history, but failure rate is really much lower than Toyota and other ""reliable"" manufacturers. This is the car that saved Porsche in 1999. I've owned 2 other Toyotas and have never really had a sports car- Im 60 years old now, not a wealthy person, but mostly been on the conservative side of family car type ownership.
I love this car because it is an icon, beautiful, comfortable and untouchable from a performance and racing legacy point of view. I would buy another.
Buyer beware however, these cars are often abused, but they can take it like no other make. 

Personally I think the 996s are one of the best 911 designs, because it was the first  thoughtful departure from the old VW bug aesthetic...from the 1998 models forward, the Porsche became a modern car. Porsche sold more of this 996 series than all other series prior, so they did something very right. Just look at the brand new 991 models, they are very similar to the innovative design of Pinky Lai and that design language is carried on today. The 996 headlights were a style complaint from many of the owners of the 1999 model - but Porsche fixed that the following year of the new 911- the design is not ugly (subjective), but again innovative for the time. In fact, the lights came directly from the GT1 high performance exotic Porsche. Then the lights were moved to the Boxster - which preceded the new 996 911 and was considered a good thing. Owners of the pricier 911 didn't want their ride to look like the cheaper Boxster from a distance. Water cooled is a more reliable than the air cooled and interior comfort is on par with modern vehicles. The interior is very comfortable. I drove from Boston to Hershey Pennsylvania - 7 hours and didn't feel stiff or achy at all. Very surprised, but pleased. Only real complaint is that cabin noise had a lot of engine and wheel/ tire noise and can be tiresome after many miles of highway driving. On the flip side it's sound is intoxicating when accelerating and cornering, giving occupants the visceral feeling of driving in a true race car legend.

 I now have 99,000 miles on this car and this is still my daily driver- 90 miles per day all year round. We live in New England where snow and ice is a regular occurrence. Super stable in the snow and wet for such a light car.
After all these years, I still get thumbs up from all age drivers and pedestrians. 
The 4S model (mine) is the Turbo look style so it has all of the great wide body wheel wells, has Turbo (large) brake discs, Turbo clutch, sits very low and was like that stock in 2004. All the rage these days , racer boys slam their rides to the ground for the right stance. Porsche figured that out ages ago and the car still looks and performs better than any modern car today.
I've had two main problems though: a torn CV boot on the front wheel viscous drive transmission, caused a bearing to fail and killed my differential. I replaced that with a used unit for $3K. Power steering fluid got low every few months. A major leak was found in the steering rack at 99.7K miles and decided to sell the car.
I love this car. After changing away from the summer sticky tires to all weather radials, the noise in the car is now very tolerable by -10dB from before and the tire wear is superb. Finding replacement parts has been easy for plastic, light bulbs and small parts. Transmissions, glass and remarkably, carpet is hard to impossible to find. Gas mileage is very good at 31 mpg with Premium, and about 23 with middle grade unleaded (89 octane).
I frequent PCA club events and car shows as a spectator, but people ALWAYS say you should be showing that car, because it is extraordinary in its lines, color (Midnight blue metallic-special order color and Natural All leather interior) and
 sound. 

If you can get one, do it. The 996 is an incredible deal right now because the purists are poo-pooing the water cooled machines driving the price down. Btw: air cooled may be interesting from a design point of view but the reason Porsche is still in business and still the king of racing is because the water cooling allowed more horsepower in a smaller engine size which translates to a better power to weight ratio. Interestingly, new 911's have a smaller block, with turbo and automatic transmissions - because they are faster and again lower power to weight ratio. Still water cooled, just like all other cars on the planet. Whats the point in having a great car and keeping it in the garage? Get a boost to your street cred, have FUN driving EVERY day and enjoy that rush acceleration and flat hard cornering gives you. No one drives this car without finishing the ride with a big grin on their face.  I think that if a car makes you smile after every drive, many years of ownership, many miles, it is a very good value indeed.

I loved its price, acceleration, styling, engine sound, aggressive exterior, and interior creature comforts. It has the most bang for the buck without all the added expenses of a turbo which will be my next Porsche, a 993TT. Maintenance has been marginal and fuel economy exceptional for a sports car. Heads turn wherever I go, including from other Porsche drivers trying to fiqure out what type of Porsche I'm driving.  It's a novelity Porsche that packs plenty of horsepower.

Any air cooled fan will be converted. More horsepower, greater comfort, A/C - cooling and heating - that actually works, PSM to keep non-race car drivers off of the guard rails,  front and side air bags too. And the C4S has the wide body, stiff chassis, and big red brake calipers that come with the turbo.  And like the turbo, the C4S is 10mm lower to the ground than the base 911. A few recommended mods that are typically already done on these cars are aftermarket exhaust (Fabspeed on mine) and a LN Engineering IMS replacement.  I also installed an Evolution Motorsports air intake.  It sounds AWESOME when accelerating!  Just a pure pleasure to drive. And the faster the better. I have owned one since 2015 and every time I drive it I am reminded why I love the car.  And you can get one for less than $40K!

This remarkable car is everything that I expected it to be. I have babied this car at times only to save up for the times that I come across other Porsches, Ferrari's, Lambo's, or motorcycles. There are times when you want to drive the car like it designed to be driven.  Once, while getting into the car and planning to go to the office, I realized that 8 hours had gone by and two tanks of gas later, and the office was closing for the day. I drove up and down the beach over 3 counties and took it up to 168 mph on the highway.  Get one. Period."

time, I made the move to a Porsche 
(Targa) two months ago . I wish I 
would have made the purchase sooner.  
If you are like me, there will be 
countless hours of price/performance 
analysis and attempts at cost 
justification.  

If you have the money, do not waste 
the effort - buy the Porsche in the 
style you want and do not look back.

I bought the Targa for its looks (a 
differentiator and rareness) open 
feeling and extra headroom.  The power-
roof works very well and there is 
little wind or road noise.

It is hard to explain the drive in the 
limited words available.There is no 
comparison with any other street 
vehicle."

Interior is designed beautifully. The wide body and fat rear rubber of the S are the icing on the cake. The new age 911s are a perfect blend of the 911s of the past and the grand touring vehicle the 928 was intended to be. This car is world class!"
porsche,911,2004,Mr.Michael, 02/21/2007,Rare and True Performance,4,"The GT3 is a 100% performance vehicle. Its very low production has made the price of these cars stable. You do get what you pay for, however. The car keeps you very alert. Correct driver input is required. This is a real drivers car. It has no electronic traction control or stability management aids, no sunroof, no rear seats. Just a raw 911 driving experience."
porsche,911,2004,Mudslide Slim, 03/26/2020,"After 3 years, still excited to drive it",5,"This is one of those cars you fall in love with over time. The longer I've owned it, the more I have come to appreciate the  looks and performance. I say this because I was not 911 knowledgeable when I bought a 4S (to replace my beloved Lexus SC400 which was totaled out).

I've always liked the 911 style, but had little knowledge. I did my homework and learned about the many pro's and few overblown cons (mostly headlight styling and IMS bearing failure). I ended up with an immaculate 4S for less than the price of a new Prius. It has been very reliable. Aside from routine maintenance, in 3 years  I've had to replace the battery, an oil pressure sender, rear brake pads, and a power steering hose. The IMS had been changed by the prior owner.

I love looking at it in the garage. It is a classic now in spite of what others may say.  I still get excited firing it up, accelerating like a bat out of hell, and  taking it through its paces on twisty roads. This was a $90K+ car new and the value is still there. 

Downsides? Yeah, cost of maintaining and repairs can be out there, but so far I'm good with it and I can do some of the work myself. It is not the rolling lounge chair my Lexus was. Seating is great, but more road feel and noise. Oddly one comes to appreciate that feel as a reminder of the racing beast within. A combo of rawness and refinement. Keep an eye on the rear tires as they wear quicker than normal cars. My car is pristine  and I tend to be careful wear I park it. so you may want to have an alternative vehicle for the supermarket trips.

I guess the highest accolade I can give is that I have no plans to buy a newer one and intend to keep this for long, long time. "

It differentiates itself from all other Carreras with 911 badges, Porsche GT paint, horsepower, interior, stereo, and polished wheels. I was just at a Porsche car show with 200+ Porsches and mine was the only 40th anniversary. I had to fight people off with questions and comments about how beautiful the car was. What a great exhaust sound. The matching Porsche leather luggage is frosting on the cake. This car is coooool!"

did I realize it would become a 
nightmare. I have always loved the 
look and sound of the 911, but have 
been generally disappointed since 
owning it. I still think the look and 
sound is outstanding, but the 
performance is really nothing special 
for a car that stickered out over $100 
K. You can get better performance from 
a corvette or BMW M3 for half the 
price.  In addition, the reliability 
has been abysmal as the car has been 
in the shop approximately every 2 
months.

Finally, the Porsche mystique has been 
severly compromised by the Boxster.

My advice for future owners? Admire 
from afar but do not purchase! "

Camaros, I was wrong.

Could not live without the 911, 
purchased one last month at HBL at 
Tysons and absolutely love it.  Been on 
Fun Runs with it on the back Va country 
roads really putting the car to the 
test and it passed with flying colors.

Porsche is a standard that sets the 
levels for all other sports cars."

coupes before, this is my first Cab.  
The difference is well worth the extra 
money, as is the four wheel drive.  It 
is really hard to explain the feeling 
of travelling Pacific Coast Highway 
going through the curves at speeds I 
won't mention with the top down!  

In the past, I've always opted for the 
tiptronic transmission, but I went for 
the 6 speed manuel on this car.  It is 
incredibly easy to use and enables you 
to get performance that you just can't 
get from an automatic.

this is the best vehicle I have ever 
driven!"

simply a sports car.  Arguably the 
world's greatest sports car.  In the 
end, I reasoned that at my age (I am 
35) I want the emotional sensations 
that come from driving a Porsche.  I 
never wanted to be that 55 year old 
trying to grasp at his youth so I 
thought if I don't get one now, I

porsche,911,2004,John Nothelfer, 04/06/2017,Overlooked Gem,5,"Unfortunately, the 2004 Porsche has taken the same bad rap as all the other years of the 996 Porsche's.  I feel my 996 is definitely superior to the 993 Porsche I owned previously but its value is about half.  Comparing my 993 with my 996 is like comparing a high school baseball player with a MLB player.  I feel the 996 is superior in every aspect- comfort, performance, reliability, etc.  I've had the IMS bearing upgraded so I have no worries about the car's reliability.  I intend to keep it serviced and enjoy it for many years to come.  Perhaps the same story will be written in years to come like the sudden increase in prices of turbos over the last few years.  The second generation 996's certainly deserve more respect.  During the last year, I've replaced some normally serviced components (spark plugs, ignition coils, oil, coolant) but other than that, just gas.  I found the more I drive it, the better it looks.  Just my opinion.

The light front end and immediate steering is the 911's best trait - - along with the phenomenal power.  Don't be misled by factory number or magazine writeups...the S model will consistently do 0-60 in 4.1 seconds.  The low-end torque is unbelievable, although at 6000 rpm the car is running out of steam and wants to be shifted.  The acceleration and braking are dizzying -- it's unlike any other car that can be used as a daily driver.  Plus, you can fit 2 kids in the backseat and get 27 hwy.  Amazing."

porsche,911,2005,lacey, 02/13/2005,Love my turbo s,4,"The only problem I have is that a new body style 997 came out in 2005. I only wish they would have made the 2005 Turbo S Cab in the 997 body style. Otherwise this car is all you could want in a sports car. I added the performance chip, tubi exhauast, lowenhart rims, lowered it and added some suede.  I ordered almost every option except the back up sensors, (I wish I would have) they really help in tight areas. I love the look and feel of this car."
porsche,911,2005,royalpar1, 07/10/2005,Finest Automobile made,5,"This is the finest auto made, hand made, and the fun factor is thru the roof. Where can you get a street legal race car which is affordable to drive?"
porsche,911,2005,Steve, 10/28/2005,A True Driver's Car,5,"My Dad purchased a 996 GT3 a couple months ago and all I can say is WOW!  We had the privelege of driving the car on the track and it is unbelievable.  The car sticks like glue and the carbon ceramic brakes are extremely powerful.  He just had a new exhaust installed and the engine sounds even better than it did before.  If you're looking for a car that can be used as a daily driver and also take to the track on the weekends, this is your car.    "
porsche,911,2005,mark fisher, 02/09/2006,2005 C4S,4,"My 4th Porsche  911, and each one has gotten better and better. This one is by far the best of all: it has more speed, comfort, luxury, handling. In this modern world, it is nice to know that the 911 remains one of those special cars, and as the old ad says, ""there is no substitute""...still."
porsche,911,2005,bob c, 12/20/2004,2005 Porsche Carerra,4,"The 2005 Porsche 911 Carrera is a solid improvement over my 996 (which I believe was a leap ahead of the 993).  It hae better looks with the new 1.7 inch wider body, 1 inch wider tracks, an interior that finally fits an $80,000 car, and more features that work well with a sports car. This is the best Porsche value in 6 years in a near supercar package."
porsche,911,2005,Bruce, 07/28/2005,If you like raw speed and handling,4,This is the essence of sports car driving. A little rough as a daily driver but if you like track events you shouldn't buy anything else. A true race bred street legal piece of machinery. You'll have tons of fun answering silly questios from the kids in the tricked out Civics! If you can afford it....buy it!
porsche,911,2005,Silver GT3, 09/07/2005,Street Legal Race Car,4,"Just one thing comes to mind everytime I drive my GT3.  Incredible.  To be able to drive a Cup car on the streets is a real treat.  The sound of the engine is mesmerizing.  I find myself shifting at high RPM each time just to hear it.  The acceleration, brakes and handling are out of this world.  I had a 2003 996 Carrera before this and it is night and day difference.  This car is very rough and loud, but that is what I like about it.  It is the essence of a Porsche and pure driving pleasure.  My only regret is that I didn't get one sooner.  Everyone I've taken out on a ride is spellbound.  My wife makes me take her out at least twice per week.  Get one and enjoy it."
porsche,911,2005,Ed, 10/02/2005,No Garage Queen Here,4,"After logging 1,000+ miles in the first 2.5 weeks of ownership, I can already tell it will be difficult to keep the annual mileage under 15,000.  It is that much fun and that easy to drive.  The 6-speed transmission and clutch are no problem, even in heavy traffic.  I went for the ""S"" over the base, after realizing that I would be adding PASM, xenon lights and a sport steering wheel to the base model.  So the net difference for the bigger engine and 30 extra horsepower was ""only"" about $6,000.  I highly recommend the Sport Chrono for the enhanced throttle response.  The navigation system is OK, but not as good as Acura's.  My two daughters, 7 & 10, fit reasonably comfortably in the back seats.  This is the ultimate ""family car""!  "
porsche,911,2005,VERLAECKT , 09/02/2006,Living the Dream,4,"After dreaming about owning a 911 for almost 30 years I bought my first one ten years ago.  The 997S cab is my fourth and it's simply amazing how Porsche manages to make an almost perfect car every time better and better with each generation. The minute you start the engine, the party begins.  It's a great way to escape the stress of every day work! From turn to turn, from one traffic light to another it's pure wellness for all your senses: the ears, the feel in your body...you become one with this car.  You can really experience the work of the sound and vibration engineers!  Fabulous!"

May not be as much fun for the passenger-but never had a complaint. A little difficult getting in and out-but once in the driver's seat this is a special vehicle.

porsche,911,2005,hfloeffler, 07/30/2005,I love this car,4,"This car is a pleasure to drive.  It performs effortlessly on city streets and outrageously well on the highway.  On winding country hillside roads the performance is astounding.  The active suspension system (PASM) kicks in and pulls the car level in the hardest turns.  You finish a turn with the feeling that there were no ""G"" forces at all.  The interior is terrific."
porsche,911,2005,larry bonine, 06/09/2008,Owner,5,"The second Porsche I have owned and this one even exceeds all expectations.  The turbo feature makes it an absolute thrill to drive (both the sound and rocket like take off.)  I have put us through a PCA Drivers Education day for total bonding between the boy and his car.  Additionally, we liked Porsche so much, we also got the Cayenne Turbo S and could not be more pleased with our decision.  That it is number one in quality three years running surprises us not at all.  "

porsche,911,2005,uwe2, 02/02/2011,Will never part...,4,"I'm the second owner, for > 3 years now. I like the performance, the look, and the compliments I still get from people today (the vehicle will turn 6 years this summer). No way to describe riding this piece of German engineering, you have to experience it for yourself.
The only complaint I have is that the clutch doesn't seem to last very long - I had to replace it at ~21k miles, and I'm not driving with a heavy foot."
porsche,911,2005,Steven, 02/15/2005,Amazing!,5,"This is the most amazing automobile that I have ever driven.  It handles like a race car, its brakes like no other car, and it accelerates like cars costing two to three times as much.  This is the best sports car under $100,000 in the world, and one of the few that can handle the rigors of daily commuting."
porsche,911,2005,Randy, 02/27/2005,European delivery,4,"We picked car up at the Stuttgart Germany  factory after a test drive on Porsche's Weissach test track and a factory tour. Fascinating! What an amazing production facility. The turbo was as easy to drive in city traffic with its 6 speed manual as it was to do 150+ on the autobahn.  The car clung to the narrow Swiss mountain curves like it was a valley strait away. Its awesome power threw us back in our seats. 50 to 100 was like 25 to 60 in our old C4. The removable hard top made the ride quiet and smooth like an excellent luxury car.  At 6' tall, leg room let me stretch out. The navigation system was supurb & got us to our Paris hotel with no wrong turn. Gas was 14 to 22 MPG."
porsche,911,2005,Robert, 04/16/2005,Like No Other,5,"When it comes to sports cars none can match the 911.  Throughout the years I have owned many vehicles, even a Ferrari.  When it comes right down to it, though, none are nearly as satisfying as the Carrera.  With its timeless exterior and genuinely luxurious interior it cannot be matched in any category.  "
porsche,911,2005,H, 04/17/2005,Magic,4,"I'd test driven other cars and was getting frustrated with their compromises.  My ten year old BMW M3 was still looking very competitive!  And then I drove the 911 and it had the same magic, the same quantum jump over the others that impressed me ten years ago with the M3.  I had to have one."
porsche,911,2005,Jocko, 04/30/2005,One hot drop top,5,"This vehicle is like riding a rocket ship. I have an '89 and the obvious diference is performance, style,etc. The sport mode in the new Cab lets you feel the road and all of the great Porsche features ,speed, handling, and the interiors are really boss. Go Porsche! "
porsche,911,2005,Ron, 05/03/2005,O my turbo,4,The best handling car and the fastest car I have ever owned.  At 175 mph it feels like 75. Very fast and stops just as well with no brake fade.

The only thing I have a complaint about is the emissions.  I've had to take it to service a few times to adjust the check engine light.  The emissions system is very delicate on this car."
porsche,911,2005,Randy, 05/29/2005,4S Cabriolet,4,After one year this car is still just as much fun to drive.  The convertible top is a neat feature and this car's reliability has been excellent.
porsche,911,2005,dht, 06/11/2005,Porsche - There is no substitute,5,"While giving more than lip service to comfort, the new  911 has improved on its already awesome acceleration and handling.  I have a ""base"" model Carrera w/ few options and it delivers handling, class, and admiring comments wherever I travel.  I paid $69,000 for my C2 model and have not regretted it -- the extra 10 to 15K for the S model didn't seem worth the extra dollars.  I test drove both the Carrera and the Carrera S, and there was no real discernible performance improvement for the extra bucks."
porsche,911,2005,Sergio, 06/11/2005,997 Carrerra,4,"This is a beautiful, sporty, and amazing machine!  Unlike the older model, (996) this 2005 has all the retro Porsche styling along with the smoothest, quickest, and most firm 6 speed I've ever experienced! Top speed, don't even ask.... "
porsche,911,2005,lol, 12/30/2005,Are We There Yet?,4,"I recently changed from a Porsche 911 996 to a 997s.  The 997 is more of a car in terms of value for the money.  It is gorgeous to look at and a huge improvement over the  996.  The Sports Chrono package is a great boy's toy.  I find the sport setting too much on twisty bumpy roads, it seems to become unsettled.  I will save the setting for track days or maybe I just need to drive it more and find just how good it is!"
porsche,911,2005,BobObO360, 12/30/2004,Definately Worth the Money,4,"The 2005 Porsche 911 Carerra S is an excellent car.  It corners beautifully. The Sports Chronos Plus Package really helps its acceleration and control, but suspension wise... the car is very stiff, not good for those who want luxury.  If you want luxury get an SL500. Porsches are made for great performance, especially the handling."
porsche,911,2005,Unknown Variant, 02/09/2005,Carrera S,4,"My first 911 ever and after 76,000 in a very modified C5 Corvette.  This Carrera S is smooth refinement... the motor and drivetrain are a thing of precision beauty, shifts are light and crisp with snick, snick, snick sounds. Driving fun is at a  new high with the Carrera S, a greater sense of driving. Porsche's three level steel safety cage, steel door beams, side impact airbags, 18 gauge steel body panels and race proven brakes removed safety concerns I always had before. Porsche's coil over damper suspension with multilink rear for strength add a chassis equal to the 4 cam motor, both of which are cutting edge. And the dealership difference is huge, too."
porsche,911,2005,Tim Hagen, 03/04/2005,Porsche-there is no substitute,4,"Porsche is the best built car in the world. The braking, handling, and over all performane is second to none.

porsche,911,2005,05Black911, 03/06/2005,Goodbye SL500 Hello 911,4,"After a series of problems with my new '03 SL500, I decided to roll the dice and replace it with an '05 911 Carrera.  Wow, what a difference!  The Porsche is a weekend car, and I love the way it handles through the southern California canyons on the weekends compared to the much heavier SL roadster.  The six speed shifter is well designed and easy to use (although I have to wait another thousand miles or so on the odometer to really push it to the redline).  I'm also impressed with the fit and finish of the car -- so far not one mechanical defect.  I've owned several MBs and BMWs (my daily driver is an X5 SUV), and so far I don't feel the Porsche will be as problematic as past experiences."

porsche,911,2005,JD, 04/01/2006,Best of all,4,"I own different cars, SL500 / 750LI .., this is best of all. You really feel a sport car from inside out. Not like other, change their style completely every 4 to 8 years, this sport can says out loud ""Porsche"". Its acceleration is excellent.  The Tiptronic transmission can be enjoyed in both auto/manual shift. My only complaints are the vehicle is too low to the ground, hard to get in or out from parking lot and the Bose stereo system is not great..  It needs more space for the backseat."

While it no longer feels like the rocketship as it was when new,  it's still a joy to drive. It has great steering, great brakes, and a wonderfully composed package.

The 993 is also beautifully built–it's a relic from a time when Porsche didn't cut corners anywhere. All it takes is to hear one ""thunk"" of its doors to understand that this is one of the most finely crafted cars of all time."

It has great brakes, engine, suspension, interior design, and yesthat sexy body style with an attitude! I love driving the 997; its superb in response, handling, and breaking.  I feel like a combat fighter pilot on a mission. Talk about stress therapy, drive a 997 and feel invigorated every time you take the perfect apex. Driving the 997 will make you a believer of the slogan, Porsche there is no substitute."""

This car is just plain fun to drive.  It picks you up, keeps you happy. For a car I cannot think of a better purchase.  Ferrari?  Got 200K?  Lotus?  Looks like a Go Cart.  Vette?  Stiff American muscle car, no sophistication.  Sorry, but this car is tops.  Expensive but not unreal.  I can think of no faults.  Sure, it could use a blue tooth and XM Radio options but this is just a classy, amazing automobile.  Buy one before life passes you by!  Oh, and if you live in a nice climate get the convertible!!

A Porsche is a Porsche but, the 911 Carrera is a very special Porsche; which can be told by the amount of people that are still hand making them compared to the other Porsche models. I don't have to consistently say the 911 is an awesome car, go and test drive one yourself and become a believer. Don't worry about Bluetooth, iPod connections, cup holders, etc, etc! This is the epitome of a sportscar, not and SUV! Don't cry about creature features, just enjoy the pleasurable driving experience on a daily basis as Porsche intended you too from the beginning! "

Its suspension is a bit bouncey on the highway as expected for the sportiness.  it is fast enough for most anyone and fun enough for me.  I have had this car for two days and love it.

This car looks, handles, performs like no other car I have driven. The S4 version makes for a wide body car that looks very aggressive (305ZR3519) with steam roller rubber under the rear combined with four wheel drive option gives you tremendous confidence in accelerating hard into corners.  It is one of the most fun cars to drive and with the sport exhaust, six speed transmission and sport seats that hug you and allow you to push the car, you feel like your driving a race car. The sport exhaust not only adds to the performance but provides sweetest sounding engine notes from a production exhaust. The car is a great value."

I've wanted a 911 for as long as I can remember, however, as a tall guy (6'3""), the cockpits on previous versions were too cramped. Porsche finally saw the light for the 997 and the redesigned interior offers more leg room, not to mention, with the optional ""full leather"" package, a classy appearance commesurate with a car of this caliber (and price!). This car is really FAST and the all-wheel-drive holds turns at speeds you wouldn't believe possible. I've never felt so confident behind the wheel as I do with this car. I've owned high-end Mercedes and BMWs and this car blows them away. The exterior styling gets a big ""thumbs up""."

My, my, my has it been worth the wait!  Can you say handling beyond your wildest dreams?  It is fast, but I have driven faster.  What sets it apart though is its incredible smoothness and overall mechanical balance. The workmanship is spectacular - I now understand why you see a ton of these still running after 20 years. Although it is hard to argue that any car is worth $75,000, I can at least understand why this car costs that much. It is over-engineered and built to incredible fit and finish standards. It is everything (and more) that I had ever hoped and dreamed that it would be."

This car is one with the driver, four seats, yeah right! lol This car is an extension of your driving capabilities, an expression of your need to find space and create space on the fly. Own a 745 BMW that I simply adore but sometimes, everyday if I could, you just want it to be about ""you""...and nothing else. Driving down PCH on a beautiful California night with the top down and my beautiful wife. Well it doesn't get better. Nice!"
porsche,911,2006,RYT, 03/29/2006,My Third Porsche,4,"This is my third Porsche. I have had hard tops previously, but convertib les are the best. It is pretty quiet compared to the hard top. I got all options. I am not too happy with the Bose high end stereo though. It sounds flat. The exterior needs some changes. LED will be nice.  This car is fun to drive. It's a real head turner. For daily use it is OK. It needs more luxury inside for $110,000. "
porsche,911,2006,Aaron, 06/15/2008,"Amazing handling, feel, & build quality",5,"Porsche comes out #1 again in the J.D Power survey with build quality and my experience is no different.  Classic styling never grows old.  It makes your heart skip a beat every time.  Porsche's adaptive sport seats are the best I've ever owned.  The handling & driver feedback is amazing for this car.  This isn't a hick muscle car that's only good for driving in a straight line.  Take this car into the twisties and you'll see what owning a Porsche is all about.  The agility is amazing, and Porsche did a great job of keeping the weight very low in the 3000's unlike inferior German competitors that can only boast a handful of extra hp's and trunk space."
porsche,911,2006,Eric, 11/30/2009,Thinking about a Porsche? Just get it!,4,"Somehow the Carrera S manages to exceed nearly everyone's expectations including mine. I favor performance over luxury and am impressed at how Porsche delivers both in the 997S. If you want luxury, consider getting full leather as the interior is a bit plain without it. I previously owned a Cayman S and did at least a dozen track days in it. My Carrera S came with the sport exhaust that to me, sounded just ok. I added AWE cats and exhaust and wow! It sounds great and the car is surprisingly faster, such that I now clearly enjoy it more than the Cayman S."
porsche,911,2006,fredflyer, 12/10/2005,"This year, there really is no substitute",4,"This is the fourth Porsche I have owned and I traded a 2002 Turbo for my new C4S.  The handling characteristics are superior along with the ride.  There is a sports suspension and exhaust setting that sweetens the tones of the engine even more.  The body, which includes a very wide rear held up by 19"" wheels looks like it was sculpted by an artist. The sports chrono package, which includes a dash mounted stop watch demonstrates Porsche's ability to evolve without forgetng its roots. The classic ""rounded"" headlights are back.  If you go and drive one, you will buy it."
porsche,911,2006,Speed Racer, 01/02/2006,The Ultimate Daily Driver,5,"Having owned 17 cars in my lifetime with most of them being sportscars this is my second Porsche 911 and I have finally found a car that I will purchase for the rest of my life. It is very predictable, even when pushed to the limit, it is fun to drive, and the sound of the engine is pure pleasure. But the best thing of all is that it can be used as a daily driver unlike many exotics. Why only use your sports car on the weekends? If there is anything to critizise, it would be minor build quality issues, but all warranty related issues are graciously handled by the dealership."
porsche,911,2006,Dave, 06/08/2006,Jekyl and Hyde,5,"The performance and handling are spectacular - effortlessly fast, solid, sure and nimble. On the track at the Porsche Driving Experience, the capabilities of this exceptional machine are revealed to the drivers. Even after a day of on-track training, a few hot laps with the instructors at the wheel show that only a fraction of the 911's abilities will be ever tested on the street by us mere mortals.  This car is personal; it fits like a fine leather glove. The controls are simple and intuitive, once programmed for driver preferences. "
porsche,911,2006,barryvon, 01/17/2006,2006 Porsche 911 Carrera S Convertible,4,"My 2006 Porsche 911 Carrera S Convertible is silver with the natural brown leather (baseball glove) interior. It is beautiful. I have not had any issues with it, other than my dealership.  It sounds good and moves great.  The best feature is the PASM & PSM, which make this 911 a comfortable daily driver. This feature alone antiquates pre-2005 models. The S package for $10,000 makes the needed difference. Get the S and get the full leather option as well, for $4800, the rich leather smell and look are awesome. My garage smells like leather and the engine every morning. This car's total price came to $107,000, which is more than I expected but once you are spending $91,500 what's the difference, add the ubgrades and make it a great luxury car. It has a quiet convertible top. This car sounds awesome in a tunnel!  There is no wind with the screen and windows up. It has a good navigation system, too."
porsche,911,2006,Coop, 02/13/2006,Awesome!,5,The 2006 C4S Cab is the most enjoyable car I have ever owned!  Porsche did this one right by raising the headlights and widening the rear fenders.  The power of the S model is perfect.  I have owned a Turbo model in the past and would never go back as the 911 S is the perferct balance of power and control.  Porsche remains my top pick with the new 997 model now out in a convertible!
porsche,911,2006,w corsini, 02/18/2006,There is no Substitute,4,"I have always wanted a 911 for a long time and when I finally got one, I was not disappointed.  I have not used the radio as the engine is a joy to listen to through the rev range.  Its cornering and braking have to be experianced to be beleived.  This car is a must have."
porsche,911,2006,RT, 04/16/2006,Porsche Carrera S Convertible,4,"I traded in my my hard top for a convettible. Believe it or not, the inside is as quiet as the hard top's was. The interior should be more luxurious since the car costs $100,000+. I have a 325W Bose stereo but am not too impressed. It still sounds FLAT when the top is down. Last week I up grade the Amp to 600W. Now the car is awesome. NOTE TO EVERYONE: Remember every Porsche is different from others.  For example, one car's crutch feels different from others. From my experience, all 3 Porsches I have owned, everything is perfect except one minor defect. My first one had loose inside door handles.  With my second one, the car vibrated hard when the AC was on. Now in my third one, there is a rattling noise from the driver's side door while crusing.  My dealer could not repaid any of these issues."
porsche,911,2006,David, 05/14/2006,Great Car,4,"The 2006 Porsche 911 turned out to be one of the best sports cars on the market.  It has great handling, style, performance, and so much more.  It is worth every penny of its price."
porsche,911,2006,Cruz, 09/01/2006,Worth the Wait,4,"After driving a Boxster S for two years I couldn't wait any longer and went big for a 2006 Carrera S convertible.  So far all I can say is WOW!  The performance of the car is unmatched with more potential than I will probably ever use. I loved my Boxster S but the power and handling of a 911 S is worth every dollar I spent on it. I did reseach on all the top end sports cars and if your looking to upgrade look no further than the 911. I had plenty of ""competition"" come up to me in the Boxster...now when I have cars come up fast from behind you can literally see them back off after reading the Carrera S on the back."
porsche,911,2006,rlf3md, 11/04/2006,Great Experience,4,"This is a great, great, great, great car! I am thinking of getting the 911 Turbo now. I'm not sure why I didn't buy one sooner."
porsche,911,2006,Ray, 11/29/2006,The Best 997 Yet,5,This is an awesome car that is fun to drive and own.
porsche,911,2006,Porsche Guy, 11/29/2006,Like a Space Ship,5,"This car is almost as I would imagine a space ship.  I have owned many Porsche cars, and the 997 is a step beyond, except for the Carrera GT.  Thank you Porsche for making my life on earth, more complete!"
porsche,911,2006,CardinalsFan, 12/17/2006,A Rocket on Steroids,4,"This is my second 911. The 2006 Carrera S is lightning fast. Press the Sport Crono package button, hit the gas, and what a blast. The difference between by 2001 911 and my 2006 is substantial. The 2006 model offers much more comfort and more acceleration. It is more expensive, but in my opinion, it's worth it."
porsche,911,2006,clif, 12/26/2006,Club Coupe is a Winner,4,"This is an incredible car.  It is sensitive to tire pressures, 381 hp w x51 kit.  The harder you drive it, the better it drives. i.e. more the confident you will be in it's capabilities.  The engine is very flexible and has gobs of power above 4,200 rpm.  It has the sport chrono which makes the throttle more sensitive, firms the shocks for more precision driving and opens that melodious Porsche exhaust up.  After 5,000 miles, I still get excited driving this car. There truly is no substitute.  It is a world beater with 3.8 liter six cylinders.  Wow.   The engineers have triumphed over the physical issues of a rear engine vehicle."
porsche,911,2006,flesavoy, 05/27/2008,Ultimate convertible,5,"No drama in the curves no matter what speed. Prestige and power, Gotta love it!"
porsche,911,2007,ex BMW driver, 09/01/2006,It doesn't get any better!,4,"What a phenomenal automobile! This car has met and surpassed my highest expectations, it does everything exceptionally well. Its nice low end torque makes everyday driving a pleasure but get the revs up and you better hold on, this car will fly. I have never experienced a nicer shifting manual gearbox or better brakes. The steering input is almost telepathic, the fit and finish is top notch, the ride comfortable, the seats supportive, and all controls fall readily to hand. It doesnt get any better. Porsche's list of options offers something for everyone (but they are pricey) and you can order a one of a kind car right from the factory, lots of fun. "
porsche,911,2007,Joe B., 09/26/2006,Fantastic,4,This car is too much fun.  My only complaint is that it has overly complex radio settings.  It has great styling and performance.
porsche,911,2007,mcspeed, 03/13/2015,Look at that S car go!,4,"Mine is a metallic black '07 Carerra S Coupe manual I've driven for 15 months. No real complaints. Fast and very good handling. Drive this car on smooth but curvy roads too get the best of it. Tire noise is a problem on straight concrete, but you don't notice on blacktop. Rear grip is excellent. Acceleration is strong-pulls hard up to 6500 revs. Just the right amount of under steer for an amateur. Way quicker than my previous, a '96 Carerra 2 normal coupe. "
porsche,911,2007,Stefano Vranca, 01/13/2007,Pure Adrenaline,4,"I just got the new Carrera S to replace my 2006 BMW M5. Both cars are phenomenal machines that give you a distinct and completely different driving experience. My 911 is a manual and I cannot tell you how glad I am to drive a stick again. This car is absolutely phenomenal, a stunner, I absolutely recommend it. "
porsche,911,2007,Ross, 11/01/2006,They get better every year...,5,"This car is much improved over prior years.  It is just so well screwed together, plus the performance is outstanding.  It has more torque and more HP.  I love the new front end, as I always hated to 996 ""fried egg"" headlamps.  I decided not to spring for the ""S"" version, as the additional $10,000 was tough sell with the wife.  This is my fifth Porsche and it finally feels like the price is justified.  I splurged for the Carrera 19"" wheels - the added grip is noticeable and they are worth every penny.  The Litronic headlamps are great too.  The new 6-speed is slightly notchy, but this could be due to newness of vehicle."
porsche,911,2007,DLS, 01/21/2009,"World's Best Sports Car, Red C4S Cabrio",4,"I have 8400 miles on it.  No complaints, have run the car at Laguna Seca and Infinion Raceways.  Powers out of curves like no other car in existence.  Needs Michelin Cup tires instead of PS2 for track days.  Most fun I've ever had driving a car, build quality the best.  Ordered 22 options, which are expensive, but this is my last purchase for retirement so thought it worth it."
porsche,911,2007,WG, 12/16/2006,New to the Porsche Family,4,"My new 911 C4S has been beyond fun to drive. I cut through traffic like a hot knife through butter. I take corners as if I am on a rail! The car's fit and finish is great. It feels like it will hold up for over 100,000 miles. I am a former BMW 7-Series owner (4 over 10 years), so I am getting use to the lack of space compared to my old cars. That being said every time I get in the car and take off, I get a rush and I forget that I can't place my clubs in the trunk. Having a stick again has been great. Every sports car or performance sedan should have one (Hint BMW and MB folks). Is it worth $100,000? Time will tell. I hope so. If not maybe I'll get an S8 next.  "
porsche,911,2007,FastThinker, 03/13/2008,Convertible Fun,4,"A little wheel hop if you drop the clutch, but is an absolute joy to drive."
porsche,911,2007,Don, 11/04/2006,Best Car On The Planet,5,"My 911 Carrera 4S Cabriolet is the finest car I have ever driven.  The base price ($98,600) is high, though, and the options list is long and very expensive.  I ordered $28,000 in options so the car priced out around $132,000.  Wait until you can afford your dream car before trying a new Porsche purchase, you won't regret it when it's sitting in your garage."
porsche,911,2007,J. Goodchild, 07/07/2007,Fantastic everyday car,5,"After years of driving high-end sedans and wishing they felt more like a Porsche, I finally bought a 911.  I use it everyday, and it is an absolute joy to live with.  It is easy to drive around town, it performs well in the rain, its storage space is not large but it's useful, and it is sublime at speed, highway or not.  Everything about this car is perfectly placed, weighted, and coordinated.  It gets amazingly good mileage for such an exciting car.  I got the base 911 -  no options and no ""S"", and I have to say that it feels like I got an awful lot for my money.  If you're looking for a truly great car that you can use regularly as well as on the weekends, consider a 911 seriously."
porsche,911,2007,Travis, 02/06/2007,A Car to Drive to the Track,5,"Though the design is merely an aerodynamically improved version of the standard 911 with a ""flying taco"" rear wing and a chin spoiler that is difficult to navigate over many dips, the 997 GT3 is the most fun car I have ever had the pleasure of driving.  The car handles as if it were an rails with a ride to match.  The suspension is stiff and communicative while the shifter is exact and positive.  The straight line performance is on par with the likes of the 1999-2004 Ferrari 360 Modena, while its handling is that of a well tested and balanced race car.  One warning:  the car is low and and many find it too rough a ride to drive daily."
porsche,911,2007,Jakeman, 06/27/2007,Even a base Carrera rocks!!,4,"I wanted a Cayman S, but my wife insisted on having a back seat, so we compromised with a modestly optioned 911.  Most 911s sold are 911S models of one kind or another, which adds $7-8K to the car.  Having come from a 1997 E36 BMW M3, this is a huge change.  You sit lower, steering and suspension are excellent.  The torque is impressive and the engine sound - look out.  It's a daily-driver style car; don't expect it to feel like a WRX with a lowered suspension.  But when you let out the throttle it's fantastic, especially while cornering.  It's a classic design and very comfortable to sit in.  Save up and order one new; you will avoid getting the ubiquitous silver car with black interior."
porsche,911,2007,bob, 07/29/2010,997 4S,4,"Very fun, very fast a blast to drive.  Maintenance expensive, but so what?  So is the car.  This car is a real head turner!"
porsche,911,2007,mcspeed, 06/19/2014,Porsche 997 series 1,4,"I've driven this low miles '07 Carerra S Coupe for 7 months now and it's a joy every time I get in it. it's my 2nd Carerra, after a '96 C2 Coupe. the difference is like night and day. This car sticks like it's on RAILS, even with the sport setting in off'. with it on, no telling how sticky it would be, but the ride is v harsh with it on. the engine sound is beee yoo tiful!. I like it better than the sound of the air cooled cars, though some will disagree. The S type brakes are very good-they invite you to go hard into corners. I have the basalt metallic black with black leather. looks great and drives great. "

porsche,911,2007,C2, 09/02/2006,Exceeding Expectations,5,The performance of this car in the automatic with Tiptropic S is beyond belief.  The quality of construction far exceeds all other sports cars.  I'm waiting on the Cabriolet!
porsche,911,2007,07911Turbo, 12/03/2006,2007 Porsche 911 Turbo,5,"Simply put, it is the epitome and the pinnacle of all super cars to date."
porsche,911,2007,Bob , 07/19/2008,Still a piece of Fine Art,4,Sold an Audi RS4 to get back to a 911. Still the most fun there is for driving. May not be the fastest but by far the most fun. I hope it is my final buy b4 retirement.
porsche,911,2007,colorado trooper, 12/20/2007,Exceeds Expectations,5,"This is my dream car!  The performance, styling, and build quality is beyond comprehension.  This car gets many lookers and questions. I was considering the 997 Turbo, but my wife asked ""Where can you drive it?"" (Drive like you mean it!) It is tricky and you have to pick and chose where you will ""let it run!""  Having the car where the public can get close does make one a ""nervous nelly"",  unless of course you have endless financial resources.  I saved for this car 25 years and it was worth it. Being a big guy 6'3"" 230 I have plenty of room to move around.  I love when the handling kicks in and the car bears down and grabs the curves!"
porsche,911,2007,blueGT3, 12/23/2007,Great Ride,5,"GT3 is a one of the all time great rides. Drove 16 hrs down the east coast as snow was soon arriving, got 26 mpg, no tickets, it's 70 degrees. GT3 is built like a vault. Everything works flawlessly. Exhaust note is exceptional when you want it, and quiet when you don't. The least conspicuous supercar made but still gets tons of looks and comments, along with cell phone picture taking. The ceramic brakes are remarkable often the standard in braking comparisons.  3000 perfect miles since August."
porsche,911,2007,TK, 01/29/2008,2007 Porsche 911 GT3,4,"I recently traded my '06 Z06 for an '07 GT3. Best decision I have ever made. The Z06 is extremely fast, has awesome brakes and is one of my favorite cars that I have owned. Why trade in a car that I was perfectly happy with? While the Z06 is like being strapped into a massive rocket, the GT3 is like every limb having its' own individual rocket.  The connectivity to the GT3 is unbelievable. The response to every input is precise and right now. The ""bang for your buck"" argument of the Z06 is a lost one if you can afford a GT3. It is WAY more fun to drive and has a TON more character and refinement - crisp feel of the shifter, the rapid revs, and the absence of the ""bath tub"" feel set it apart"
porsche,911,2007,Woods, 09/16/2009,Should have got the Turbo first!,5,"Bought a nice '07 C2S and only had it for a couple months before getting the Turbo. Night and day! This car has it all...comfort, tons of power and the looks to go with. Mine has the tiptronic transmission and you can find a lot of good and bad reviews about it. For me since I don't track the car I am ok with it. Put it in sport mode and let the fun begin!"
porsche,911,2007,redcoud, 12/25/2006,Best Decision I've Ever Made!,5,"I am simply pleased with everything about my 911.  There are no peers with regard to a total driving experience, quality of fit and finish, and sheer curb appeal. "
porsche,911,2007,KEF, 03/27/2007,This car is awesome,5,"This is my first 911. I had always been a fan of American iron but decided to take a look at the Carrera. I took one for a test drive and was hooked. Took it on vacation recently and averaged 25 mpg @ 80 mph. The break-in period is 2k miles and the car has to be driven lightly (under 4K RPM). You'll find yourself parking it at the back of the parking lot to keep poeple from denting the doors. We got one transferred from a different dealer that had Xenon, Bose, heated seats, and a few small options. I would say if you can afford one and are looking for the perfect combination of power, comfort and luxury, this definitely is the car for you. If I had to do it again, I'd get the tiptronic also."
porsche,911,2007,Dan, 05/09/2007,The only super car you can use every day,5,"This car is a leap foward for anyone wanting the performance of a Ferrari/Lamborghini but the practicality of a usable car for every day driving on U.S. roads. There is quite simply no other car that can compare for use on normal road conditions. I did bump the HP & TQ to 600 but it isn't necessary, as this car can deliver everything you could ever desire right off the show room floor."
porsche,911,2007,Karl H, 05/14/2007,"All-Singing, All-Dancing, All-Conquering",4,"This is a stupendous car!  I've been a Porsche aficionado for 25 years.  This is my 5th Porsche, and I never imagined it could be this good. It goes, stops and (mostly) handles at a level that is beyond my experience.  It is very user-friendly, and a complete pussycat to learn, unlike the hair-shirt 996 GT3s.  It is a fundamentally understeering car, which is the key to its benign nature.  Alas, the understeer is too much of a good thing.  It needs more adjustability so the push can be overcome by knowledgable owners.  That said, it was sooo satisfying to put away a Viper, a Corvette Z06, all BMWs, all other Porsches and most everything else I encountered at Watkins Glen last weekend! "
porsche,911,2007,X51C2S, 07/27/2007,bye bye BMW,5,"After 35 years of uninterrupted BMW ownership I purchased my first Porsche last August. The car is superb in every way.

porsche,911,2007,Alan Eland, 08/11/2007,997S break in,4,"My fourth porsche and its my most enjoyable car, I had the dealership add sport exhaust and the sound is outstanding in the open mode, it handles great and rides a bit rough in sport mode but I love it."
porsche,911,2007,bobc, 11/09/2007,Amazing,5,"I can't say enough about this Porsche. I have had over 30 cars over the years and this Porsche is nothing but a complete joy to drive. This is my second Porsche and it is nothing short of amazing. It handels great and the interior has been well done (unlike the 1997 Carrera 4 I had before). I love it and have put 9,000 miles on it im a few short months (so much for resale value). Oh well, I am having to much fun in it."
porsche,911,2007,C4S is best, 05/04/2008,C4S over Turbo,5,"The balance of this car is marvelous. This is my 3rd Porsche and is the best. I had a 996 Turbo, but you couldn't drive it slow, as you were always in the turbo. I've never felt so connected with a car and in complete control. The build quality is unequaled. Fit and finish are typical German quality."
porsche,911,2007,ALAN.AYLING, 12/13/2007,Greatest Car Ever ?,4,"The Car is simply exhilarating but extraordinarily straightforward to drive. However it is not for the faint hearted or uncommitted driver. It demands concentration every moment at the wheel. It is the first car that I have driven that ensures that I am not interested in a radio, the CD player or the scenery beyond the road ahead. The car obeys every input, is totally surefooted and yet blows your mind every time you hit the accelerator. On top of this the car is a great investment and has a fantastic build quality. I hate cars that shake or squeak at every twist, turn or bump in the road. This my second porsche and I doubt that I will ever be happy with any other alternative in the future. "
porsche,911,2007,rapan, 09/30/2006,Glitches!,4,"Electronic glitches plauge the 911!  The electronic fuel gauge has a mind of it's own!  Overall, though it performs well and has good styling.  The manual transmission shifts well and smoothly.  "

I got just about all the options including the carbon ceramic brake package. I chose to get the aluminum trim package as well as the fully adaptive leather seats. A lot of people think the tiptronic is better, but having the 6-speed manual is far more responsive. What I do in this car I know I did. It's beyond amazing. Fuel economy is also amazing for a car with this much power and speed. The best of 2007... the Porsche 911 Turbo gets my vote! "
porsche,911,2007,twocoasts, 12/02/2007,Not a city car,4,"I am a BMW driver - this is not a city car. You need open road to run it for an hour over a hundred mph while your eyes are peeled looking for the law. I cannot understand how any one can use this car running from 30 - 70 mph. I am coming up the Florida Turnpike walking past everything that moves - my passenger asks me how fast I am going - I am doing 75 mph and it feels like 45. This is my dream car, I need no more power, but hitting 50 years old, I am looking at Jaguar XJR so I can cruise and not destroy myself or lose my license."

Obviously totally different vehicles, but this car is fun in every drive scenario.  Almost everyday I get interesting looks and comments.

porsche,911,2007,BB, 11/12/2008,Yellow C4 Cab,4,"I just bought this car a week ago after owning 4 other 911's.  This is my 1st C4.  Add ons:  20' Champion wheels, Aero kit, suspension.  The AWD is worth the money.  I live in a mountain community with a lot of winding roads. The car handles great.  Definite improvements since 2005."

I live in an area with a lot of twistys. I can't get enough of them. This is my first real sports car. I've driven a lot of sports cars but nothing compares to this. Prior to this, I owned 1996 4-runner with a 4 cyl engine! I can't see myself driving anything other than a Porsche from now own. I'm trying to convince my wife into getting the Panamera as a ""family car"" :). I average only 18 MPG mainly because the exhaust note is intoxicating above 4000 rpms that you repeatedly max out revs before each shift change. I guess if I didn't do that, I would get better mileage. But who cares."

You can't use even 50% of the car's performance without risking a ticket or endangering other motorists.  So mine sits in the garage most of the time.   On racetracks, it's a totally different story.  The car is very easy to drive to the limit and will do lap after lap at the max with no sign of strain whatever. It is really a piece of work!"

porsche,911,2007,TedATX, 08/31/2019,Love at first sight,5,"I have loved Porsche since the 1960's when  my math tutor showed up in his red 356 bathtub.  Then a few years later a friend got a Porsche Turbo that just knocked me out.  I had a 1986 944 but found it under-powered for my tastes.  When I bought my 1997 911 S...well, it was amazing.  Great handling, plenty of power - just a blast to drive.  I still get that thrill every time I start it and hear ""that sound.""  Just a fun car to drive & contrary to many opinions, I have found it to be very free of problems.  Sure, it uses gas and when it is serviced it is not inexpensive but these days what is?  
"
porsche,911,2008,Mel, 06/02/2009,The funnest car to drive,4,"2500rpm's then HOLD ON-the power- handling-color options-fill my fickle, very picky needs! The leather, MUCH FINER than any Bentley- plus you do not have to plug it in at night (like Bentley -Aston-Ferrari- Lambo). The 150,000 is still 100,000 under the competition. Plus it ALWAYS STARTS! LOVE-LOVE IT."
porsche,911,2008,Michealangelo Harris, 01/19/2016,Nothing Even Comes CLOSE!!!,5,"This is purely an ALL OUT STREET RACE car, and yet excellent to travel in. Drove it from Dallas, TX to SUPERIOR TWP, MI, then from SUPERIOR TWP, MI to CHANDLER, Arizona, then back to SUPERIOR TWP, MI. But know, it is not intended for parking and taking short naps in. Oh, and the gas mileage is great, when you set the cruise.

Now, I use it in PCA's auto-cross. Talking about the best of both worlds, WOW. SO glad I chose this model. This is my 14th PORSCHE, I also have a 87' 911 cabrio.

It's going on four years now since I purchased this car. There have been absolutely (NO) issues with it, major or minor. I did the 80k and the 100k services on it in December of 2014, and since then I have had the brake fluid changed at Porsche where I live and a wheel alignment done after installing new front & rear tires. Since I'm a retired aviation mechanic, I installed a third center radiator, and the front bumper vent screen kit to keep heavy debris out of the left and right radiators. Then I installed a 2.5 quart deep oil sump to help with the lubrication here in HOT, Arizona! As for running auto X here in HOT Arizona, I can tell you that these two things are needed, to help keep the temps down in the water cooling department as well as the engine oil lubrication department. Other than that, I'm just enjoying it!!!

It is Aug 2018 now and I am in the process of replacing the Optima yellow top that's 7 years and 2 months old with a new Optima Blue top marine style battery. The heat here in Arizona continues to eat batteries of any type or sort alive! Also, if you have more than one car in your garage then it is absolutely imperative that you drive all of them as often as you can! Just leaving them on a digital battery maintainer is NOT enough. I also have 3 motorcycles, and recently had a BMW s1000RR cafe bike and a Harley Davidson 1200 Sportster that I got rid of because I didn't ride them enough, but I kept the Harley Davidson soft tail, of which the battery is also going slowly dead because of the heat here in the desert state. The heat just killed the batteries on the other 2 bikes, how much more the Porsche's. What I'm saying is, the 2008 997S is yet still an excellent deal when looking to purchase a used Porsche. My car has no leaks and no problems other than the battery issue which is normal for the number of years since the date on the battery was purchased, June 2011. I highly recommend a Cabrio 997s. 

As of this writing, it is Feb. 2020, and I put about 250 miles a month on the car now. The total mileage on my Porsche is some where around 106,800, and I had to replace the two coolant line inserts above the left and right front control arms, bleed the system. Since that time, I have had no other issues with this marvelous vehicle. I highly recommend this model, if not the cabrio 997s! Either one of these models would be more than enough for driving here in the U.S.!  Being that they are really made for High Speed long distance cruising on the German Autobahn. So, if you are in the market for a Porsche 997 with low mileage, then, go for the gusto! You will NOT be disappointed!

porsche,911,2008,Max Revs, 04/16/2008,911 Turbo fills the Bill,5,"The 997 Turbo Coupe is another leap forward for Porsche.  This new model has enthusiastic power across a wide power band, incredible acceleration, and superb handling.  While it would be at home on any racing circuit, it also is easy to drive around town and in traffic.  It is unusual to find a car that performs so well in a straight line, in the twisties, and can still serve as a daily driver if desired.  When the turbos kick in the car will really set you back in the seat."
porsche,911,2008,str8line, 07/18/2008,Lives Up To The Dream Of A 10-year-old,4,"As a youth my father and I never missed stopping at the Porsche dealer while driving by. I had a love affair with the guards red 911 that seemed to always be on the showroom floor. When in 1979 my dad finally purchased a 911 (930 model)Turbo I reveled in its incredible rocket ship abilities. He sold it when I was 13, but the 3 years he had it made the Porsche 911 my dream car.  As a self-made and relatively poor young man I was all but resigned to the fact that a 911 in anything other than a used and older variant just would not be in the cards for me.  Skip to Feb. 2008 and I have the good fortune of being shocked every time I enter my garage by the sight of a black 2008 911 Carrera S!"
porsche,911,2008,turbodickie, 11/07/2008,Rocketship,5,This is my 25th Porsche turbo since 1976 and my first GT2. This car is insane for the street. It is almost impossible to drive sanely. The handling is precise. The gas mileage is unbelievable considering it has 530 hp. I can get 27 mpg if I can somehow manage to do 55mph. The brakes are very close to simulating hitting a brick wall. Very overpriced but worth it. Buy one if you can find one!
porsche,911,2008,mark fisher, 01/20/2008,Carrera 2s,4,"My seventh 911, and each successive model gets better and better.

While this is my 7th Porsche since 1978, it has by far the most improvement in any I have had.  Obviously the AWD is a luxury along with the turbo wheels and tires and I have yet to hear a peep out of the tires regardless of how hard I push the car.  The leather interior upgrade is well worth the price."
porsche,911,2008,Gnslngr, 11/22/2009,Brilliant,5,"My second Porsche (after a 2007 Cayman) and perhaps my last one.  I don't believe they can make a car better than this one.  It is not so much a car as it is an experience - this car is a beast when it wants to be and is compliant and docile when my wife is in the passenger seat.  I've added an Escort Passport 9500ci to make the experience complete, and now the car (with  Sport Chrono, Sport Exhaust, and Sport Shifter) is the dream car I've always wanted.  I still cannot believe I own it; I have to do a double take every time I see it in my garage.  And the great thing about this car is that it is nowhere near as onerous to own as a Ferrari or Lambo - maintenance is relatively inexpensive."

Porsche must have listened because this Bose system is top notch.  Navigation / Computer system is a bit complicated and makes you do more steps then usual to complete the task.  I think they fixed this on the 2009s.  Bluetooth also lacking. Over all though, this car feels great and is fun to drive daily or just on weekends !  Kudos to Porsche !"

Power is always on tap and when you want to go, it moves!  Handling is like being on a roller coaster .  Built quality is top notch.  Not as quite as my wife's Lexus but hearing the engine roar is beautiful too !  Bose Premium Stereo is wonderful. Clear, good highs and bass.  Stereo / Nav. takes a bit of getting used to .  More complicated then it really needs to be.  Should have had Lexus engineered it.  Over all this is a great car !  Love the opt. Sports Chrono / Stiffer shocks button !

The turbo definitely has a more planted feel on the twisties, probably due to the 4 wheel drive and more weight up front. The c2s felt very light up front with its go kart kind of feel. The main shock to me is how civilized the power train is. Not much of a snarl. no one will hear you and even starting it up is not a noticable event. It unfortunately lacks a killer exhaust note.  My 06 C2s started with a snarl which was rewarding.  The Tip is smooth as glass, no smg here, and it goes like hell too, but will it fulfill the boy racer desire? Maybe."

You think it's a pretty quick car until you realize that, most of the time, you're hardly pushing on the accelerator - but when you ""floor it', you better be ready to shift because it'll hit the redline before you can blink. The handling borders on absurd. Supple leather seats are very comfortable. There really is no substitute!"

Porsche's are ""the complete package"". They provide super car performance, are great daily drivers, get decent fuel economy, are comfortable, good looking, reliable, have great resale value. Some cars give you some this - but none give it all to you like a Porsche. It truly is the ""real deal""."
porsche,911,2008,James, 02/09/2008,My review,2,This car has been my worst nightmare.  Problems started at 400 miles and have only gotten worse. The car has severe cowl shake and I believe that lead to a broken driver side window.
porsche,911,2008,LF, 02/04/2019,08,3,"This is a stunningly beautiful automobile.  I don't drive it in the winter because I own other German cars that are more suited for snow, mud and the salted winter roads.  The low milage is also due to the fact that I live at my summer home in MT, so I choose not to drive it down those dirt roads and you can't pick up more than 1 person at the airport. Never any trouble with it. Regular oil changes and of course tires as I burned thru a set of dreadful Yokohama Tires quickly till I switched to Bridgestone.  It lives in a climate controlled garage and there is also a car wash in the building so I can hand wash it any time. I love this car and always find notes offering to buy it on the window.  Its a beautiful Ruby Red metallic paint with a beige interior.

I enjoy my BMW M Roadster better. Here's why. I am not a huge fan of the design. I was hoping to do a longer road test, since I ""heard"" that the performance was ""good"". But, the dealer would only let me try it on traffic laden streets for around 2.5 miles. I THOUGHT it might do better, and so I enthusiastically bought it. Now, I regret it. I sold the car around 5 months after I purchased it for around 65% of the original value. I bought a Mercedes Benz AMG, and it is 500% better. Do not get this exotic want-to-be!"

It is the best thing that I have ever given myself. The car's handling saved our lives when another driver almost side-swiped us. I don't drive the car much over 75 because getting their sooner makes the fun of the drive shorter.  It is just as much fun in city driving as it is on the highway.

porsche,911,2009,McQueen, 05/11/2017,look at that S car go!,5,"This is my 3rd Carerra coupe and the cars just keep getting better. The 2009 Carerra S is fast as you want it to be and a thrill to drive. The handling is superb and you get the choice of three settings for power and suspension-normal, sport and sport plus. Each one has its individual benefits. The '09 car represents a 'mid-cycle refresh' as they say in the auto business. It is quicker than the 07-08 car and it has direct fuel injection, with 385 horsepower, versus 355 in the earlier car. I can feel the difference, having owned both. I have the optional PDK transmission. Porschephiles can debate auto vs stick for hours on end, but the simple fact is the PDK is faster. If you want fast, it's PDK. If you like the feel, the 'involvement' of the manual, then that's the way to go. I go back and forth on this question, but the PDK with the car in sport plus is in no way a non-involved experience.  You will need to give the car all of your attention, and you will be rewarded with blistering performance. Update at 30k. Still a fast and fun ride- no probs

Also quicker to accelerate.  BMW was more ""involved"". More mechanical and more intense. Porsche is more relaxed but simply responds the more it is pushed.  Overall a better performing car.  BMW was ""edgy"" so seemed to be a real performance car...a race car for the street. Porsche seems more sophisticated.  I really need to adjust my attitude.  The feeling is the limits of the car are far beyond anything I can (safely) approach on the street.  I need more time, then I will hang the tail out on some turns. An amazing automobile."

After some deliberation, decided to get the pdk with sport chrono package. Glad I did. Took it on some backroads where we could open it up. Put it in sport mode, punched it. Wow. Nothing like I'd ever experienced. My girlfriend took a turn, decided to try ""launch mode."" put it in sport plus mode. Foot on the break, she revs the engine, the car is lurching, wanting to go. She reluctantly pushes the tach to 6500 rpm, car is screaming. The console lights up ""launch mode active"" and off we go. It takes about 15 minutes to get her blood pressure back to normal."

Everything is ridiculously expensive to fix, and things go wrong all the time. The car had electrical problems because apparently the car (convertible) is not designed to deal with leaves (which clogged the drains ). Really, leaves?? Never had these issues with numerous other convertibles. The trim is cheap and the the lether just wears off from low use (I have less than 20K miles on it). Now the latest: my tail light went out.

This car is gorgeous, sexy and fun with some level of comfort and amenities that a car at this price should have.  I have owned several BMW's, SL55 AMG, Cayman S and Turbo Coupe, this is my favorite.

The driver comfort issue becomes a moot issue when the driver gets behind the wheel.  I find excuses to drive the 911 because of its unrivaled performance and ""fun to drive"" quotient.  This is not a car which is designed to put you asleep.  Rather, it is a car which responds to your every wish and performs as if it is an extension of your own psyche.  Ferry Porsche had it right; build the 911 based upon racing performance.  "

Very much as one reviewer said -  Clark Kent around town and easy going, a raging hulk when you want it to be. I've got the stick and it is really fun to drive and also helps you from going 90 around town without realizing it. If you've been wanting a Porsche and considering a sports car I can't make a higher recommendation. Take from a guy who just got his first one after 30 years of dreaming - even better live and in person!"

I love the car, the power, fit and finish. The new display for navigation, XM etc. is easy to use as is the multi-function steering wheel. The ride is much better than expected. Porsche really put it all together with the new DFI engine; PDK and cosmetic updates. And the car is simply gorgeous with the top up or down. Definitely a keeper. I have driven it way more than I thought I would...it's more than just a weekend car."

PDK is the best tranny to date.  Blows the DCT in BMW away.  I should have gotten the steering wheel mounted controls, but other than that everything is perfect.  In sports mode, this is an excellent sports car.  Should be able to default the car to this setting vs. normal.  Convertible top is quick, smooth and quiet.  Has all of the amenities of a luxury car (provided you pay for them) and they all work well.  Like they say, ""Porsche, there is no substitute."""

Handling around sharp corners at high speed is very good. Impressively very stable and the sports seat holds my body pretty well.  Definitely like the looks of the car when the top comes down.  However I don't like the look of the spoiler when it comes up, because the stainless steel lift shafts do not match the ruby red color at all.  Unfortunately there is no automatic shut off function for the head lights.  This is so common in all the luxury cars and it surprises me that Porsche does not do it.  Measured MPG=12. Bad."

The exterior design/look, as well as handling in combination with the ""instant"" acceleration available is truly fantastic.  The PDK, along with the heated/ventilated seats and upgraded Bose sound system, make this car one that I always look forward to driving every day.  The dealership and salesman that I worked with was extremely professional and did not apply any pressure to sell me a car even in light of this tough economy.  They had no problem with me discussing maintenance issues directly with the mechanic staff and reviewing the prep work order/paperwork on the vehicle that I ultimately chose."

So here it is 911 turbo. There was NO ""WOW"".  It's ok to me. I think Porsche needs new revolution. It seems to me they have not changed any big past 7-8 yrs. Come on, Nissan Skyline beats 911 turbo with half of the price . I know what everybody think ""what about quality of the car""  well, it's not that great for THIS PRICE RANGE, maybe if $40k (with opt.) less... Handling is outstanding (much better than Z06).

The van pulled out of me and I slammed into its side at 40 mph.  The safety features built into the car are functional.  My current Porsche is their new 2009 with their automatic transmission.  It's great.  The power is there when you want it.  This transmission allows my wife to drive.  She was intimidated with the older manual transmission.  One can manually shift with the steering wheel paddles, but the car's computer can handle the shifting requirements better than the driver.

No problems other than speed limits and not being able to push to limits.  I tried the PDK and it is sweet, but not engaging enough, so went with manual 6spd. Steering is precise, power is not overwhelming in the base model, but sufficient overall.  Very comfortable as daily driver.  Has been thirsty for oil; about a quart per 1000 miles."

This car is incredible and outshines the others by far. The styling and size is similar to the 911 Carrera S I had but the performance, handling, and comfort are all far better. The difference between a Turbo and other 911 models is phenomenal. I acquired this 2009 Turbo in March 2012 as a Certified Preowned Vehicle with 4122 miles on it.

The 911 has no rival for handling (because of the rear engine which makes the front end light and nimble) and celebrity status. Short trips or long, it is a pleasure. Other drivers are intimidated, especially Vettes and even an occasional inexperienced Lamborghini driver. The 6 speed manual is the only way to go for a sports car. I drive it only in good weather and put on plenty of miles. What a great ride. The only drawback is the high price, but it is the entry fee to a special place.  "

It is beyond fast, fast in the extreme, it is refined, almost too quite, and it is exceptionally comfortable for a long drive even including the back seats as long as the back seats are occupied by children (5'2"" or less).  It exudes quality and solidity that makes it a delight to drive each and every time.  It has terrific visibility:  far beyond any other car that is not a convertible with its top down, having nearly no blind spot at all, making it especially easy to drive and maneuver in town and on crowded streets.  The brakes (carbon ceramic on my car) are absolutely eyeball sucking at any speed whatsoever and never any brake dust on the wheels.   The disappointments with the car a minimal but are as follows (bearing in mind that this was a 180k car when sold new): 1) no auto on/of headlights, 2) no one touch window for passenger seat (really!),  3) no one touch open nor close sunroof (really!), 4) poor fuel economy, 5) PDK only and, while it is wonderful, it definitely is not at visceral and engaging as a 6 or 7 speed manual would be!

With so many Porsche ""Options"" to choose, from, one of the options should be the ""QUIET"" option (Road Noise).
At most times over 60 mph, you cant hear the radio. At cruising speeds on the interstate, there's no point trying to listen or talk for that matter.
 The second issue I have is with the comfort.

They are infinitely adjustable but the basic comfort is not there.

The new steering and suspension are top notch; not too stiff, but keeps the car flat when pushed.

Running the Smoky's or the popular Dragon, you are in control all the way.  Get lots of complements on the car and Fall runs with the top down is a rush.  Granted there is the sticker shock factor but what engineering, the six speed manual is a short smooth throw. 1st gear winds up fast, second is when she starts to bite, third, you are on to warp speed and the rest is velvet.  There is a Porsche club (PCA)  where you meet some great people and go on drive outs and over nighters as well as social nights.

It is purely for entertainment of anyone who likes excessive technology and electronics, although quickly dated.  There a lots of buttons and gizmos seem unnecessary.  Although understated, the vehicle intimidates jerks on the road and gets annoying attention.  Having owned at 911SC for many years, this car brings back memories, but pampers drivers.  I think the car appeals to old men with means.  Excessive road noise, automatic stereo plays whenever car is re-started, no oil dipstick (only automated display) and no access to engine are annoying.

porsche,911,2013,tmb31, 11/10/2015,2013 911 S Cabriolet,5,":::::::::::::::::::::::UPDATE: :::::::::::::::::::::: PORSCHE Corporate (Atlanta) does NOT appear to regulate it's dealerships in the order of customer service in any way what-so-ever.  I've had nothing but problem after problem with BOTH local dealerships to have simple services performed. They are impossible to get a hold of and rarely even answer the phone at the service departments. This is common to 2 separate Porsche dealerships in the Puget Sound (WA) area.   Absolutely incredible to spend over $100K on a car and deal with this level of service. The car is great but this was my 3rd Porsche and by far the worst interaction with the brand in 15 years.


ENGINE:
The 400 hp 3.8 is flat out (yes flat) incredible. The throttle response is immediate and the sound is roaring... when you want it to be.
Reliability is second to none. Average cost of maintaining it is relative to my 2007 Cayman S, around $1,200 a year. 

INTERIOR: 
The refinement of the interior is stunning over the 997 generation. Controls in the cockpit are well laid-out minus the Navigation address input which sucks stupid like a 2005 Infiniti. Aside from that, I found the cabin to be luxurious, stylish, crisp and refined to the highest standard. 14 way seats, cooled seats and the amazing cabin audio from the engine's ""symposer"" system is an orgasmic combination!!! Add the ""Sport Exhaust"" option with the top down and you'll never look at your 'love life' the same again.

Transmission?
The PDK is what I own.. with Sport Chrono (sport plus) 'paddle shifters'. If you don't have sport chrono on your 991 build then just get a 350Z and give it to your wife. 
Kidding aside, the difference between Sport Chrono and ""sport"" mode is ridiculously evident. It's like pouring gasoline on a birthday cake... spectacular! The PDK is faster than any manual shifter on the planet, more reliable and unless you're a heel-toe rock star on the track it's just common sense.

Cabriolet or Coupe'?
The looks are stunning on both. Thanx to the cabrio's magnesium panelled convertible top the continuity of the 991 lines are preserved in rigid form. The available color contrast of body and canvas top can make your 911 stand out drastically. I would suggest dumping the plain fence board wing for ducktail (sport design tail) on the cabrio... it looks much more aggressive.
But, no matter what you decide, the cabriolet is an entirely different creature under the sun. It simply screams FREEDOM! You can't beat that no matter what hardtop Porsche you have.

I don't buy Porsche for comfort, tech gimmicks, nor appropriately sized cup holders, I get that from my Lexus sedan. I own a Porsche for its racing history, performance, and responsiveness. The 991 handles as superbly on a road trip at 100 mph as it does on the streets in traffic. The acceleration for this base model is more than enough for where I live in the suburbs. I would recommend the S or Turbo if you need more speed or want to impress your friends. The ""rough ride"" should tell you that you're driving a true sports car, not an German sedan that goes fast in a straight line while you search the web and talk on the cell phone.

It's an expensive car that costs a lot for parts, service, etc.  I've had 2, both 2014 a CarerraS and a Turbo S.  I have never had 1 problem!!  I was sent to the Porsche drivers school and found out the cars were all brand new (when I was there) and here's the break in:  turn them over to student drivers who don't know proper track driving and drive the cr@p out of them.  I was told they sell them to selected dealers with full warranty/extended if the buyer purchases it, and all they do is change the oil and tires.   Their purchasers know of this arrangement and there is apparently a waiting list for these cars.  To me that spoke volumes.  My turbo at the track had 139 miles on it (I could be confusing models) and there was not 1 issue the entire day I was there.  If you can afford the price and the prices that go along with such a car, IMHO you can't beat the experience if you like German sports cars.  My dealership has an incredibly high repeat customer base.  If the cars were ""bad"" none of the above would be true.  I'm sure there are not so great cars that get built, but to act like this is the norm is just wrong.  Again I own 2 2014s, and have driven them to death.  I bought a Macan based on my 911 experience and while I've only had it a few months, it is built like a tank, with a surprisingly comfortable ride.

porsche,911,2014,DAVE, 09/03/2015,911 Carrera Base Model/Not worth it/Go elsewhere!,2,"They talk about heritage, everyday daily driver, prestige, bla bla bla. But unbeknownst to all your daily consumers, The 911's that are worth looking into are ones that are unaffordable to your typical middle class business man such as myself. 

My particular car was packaged with 20 inch S wheels, 14 way seats, bose, and sunroof. Being a BMW person, I wanted to try something different. After test driving the base 911, it seemed more than adequate. But what I learned later on was this car absolutely sucked!

This car was absolutely the worst purchase ever. The lack of TECH, Comfort, Service, and Performance made me dread the payment and the drive every single day.

Here's the breakdown:

TECH: The car has none. The user interface is so outdated that it made my sister's entry level Lexus look like a futuristic car. Navigation is useless, all buttons are very small and hard to identify, front gauges are blocked by the steering wheel, making it difficult to see how much gas you have and such. Automatic Start stop actually eats more gas then it saves,  and for such an expensive car, you would think that at least parking sensors would come standard.

Comfort: NONE. It would be idiotic to take this on a long distance trip. You will find your lower back and legs feeling very sore. Getting out of the vehicle is straining and frustrating.

Service: NONE. There is no complimentary service whatsoever, and warranty only lasts for two years. Also car requires service every 10k miles so you will find yourself visiting the stealership or mechanic quite often, spending a lot of money.

Performance: The base 911 is not what it claims. at 350 HP and a light body weight, it is underachieving. I went head on with a BMW 335i Coupe and got burned. Literally. Gas consumption is worse then my SUV. No need to elaborate there.

Don't get me wrong, if you're in the market for a Porsche 911, its a fantastic car. But just be sure not to get brand new base model. It is way smarter to purchase a pre-owned S or Turbo.

Nowadays, the competition eats base 911's for breakfast. Other factory tuned cars come  Cheaper,smarter, faster, comfortable, and nicer looking. 

Final thoughts, buy used. Do not lease or purchase new. And be sure to test drive the competition.

My daily driver was a 997 C2S that 103k miles on it and decided to upgrade to a  a used 991. Purchased a 14 991, guards red cab,  with sports chrono, all the options and sports design package. Sticker was 119,500. Paid under 70k. For the last 7k miles, including a couple of long hauls, over a thousand miles, the car ran like a top. Comfort, plenty of speed, and great mileage. I truly enjoy the new PDK, first automatic in over forty years of Porsches... If you're looking for a zoom-zoom, stop light to stop light car, save your self a few bucks and get the 335i... but be aware that six starts to cough once over a 100k miles. The non turbo sixes do not... they run forever. I wonder what the new 991.2 turbo's will do at high mileage... This 991 will be in the stable for a while... get the rag top...

porsche,911,2015,KB, 08/01/2016,What a daily driver!,5,"This will be my fourth year of driving this car, and it still brings a smile of satisfaction every time I drive it. I have never felt safer or better equipped in any car. This is a sports car that will do 189 mph  and under 3.9 seconds 0 - 60, according to Porsche (who are known to underestimate performance numbers), yet can be driven every day with no problem. Everywhere you go someone walks up to ask about it or relate a story. I have been racing, driving sports cars and muscle cars since the seventies and watched the evolution and ""dumbing up"" of so called drivers cars. This car is magnificent in driver feeling and participation. The engineering has floored me. Brakes, acceleration, effortless shifting and switching between sports modes makes  this car a dream. Maintenance is expensive, but nothing out of the ordinary just tires, brakes and fluids. However this IS first and foremost a GT SPORTS car, there are no compromises. The ride is stiff, luggage and passenger space is negligible but what a wonderful experience every time you put this car on. Porsche has always built the 911 as a true drivers car and whether tracking or daily driver, you can't get better.

porsche,911,2015,Vern, 09/06/2018,Dream car,4,"My red 911 is of course the dream car of almost everyone.  It is all I expected and more.  But moreover, the reliability of the car is remarkable.  I have owned bmws, Audi’s, Mercedes, etc.  My other German cars I refer to as German junk.  Just nightmares.  But this porsche is absolutely perfect.  ALMOST.  THERE IS ONE SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE WITH THE CAR.   The windshield is made in some odd way where the dash is reflected in the windshield.  I’m certain situations it is virtually impossible to see out.  Porsche knows this is a problem and refuses to recall the cars.

Update at 5 years: still my favorite car ever.  I have done autocross a few times at the local Porsche club and it is a dream.   

Still have trouble getting in the garage every time because of the annoying windshield reflections.

porsche,911,2015,Curt Huffman, Happy 911-4S man,Pleasure and performance at affordable price point,5,"My new 911-4S could have been driven off the lot in 2015 at $122K plus sales tax, right around $130K.  I bought it, brand new, left over dealer stock, in 2018 for $90K.  It has everything one needs for a 911; did not have the pricey mark up stuff, sports chorno pkg or any of that...it's a fairly comfortable car, but the performance quickly makes me forget any of the discomfort associated with true sports car driving.  The car is iconic; we all know that....but iconic in the way that the design of the car has subtle changes over decades...a 60s 911 is as easily recognizable as is a 2015 911. The performance is usable on US roadways; the top speed is not, but the acceleration is there to jet you through any mess or away from a bad time as well.  The motor music is pleasing; the exhaust tune is still perfect even without the enhanced exhaust one can push a button and get....this car is wide body...pure classic....as all the new 2019 911s are wide body now....used to be just the turbo flagship and the 911-4...it's a fun car to drive; even to wal mart; it is a head turner; it makes people wish and dream as you drive buy them...it made me work very hard for decades in order to afford a new one...it is a chic magnet as much as if a woman is driving it, Fabio and his friends would be all over it (or nearly any regular good guy)...This car makes me feel young; enthuses me to drive it; i love parking it and knowing people think I am way much more than I am; and then when they get to meet me and know, I am just a regular guy with an exceptional iconic 911, they know I must be a fairly prudent and pragmatic man as well.  For sure, this car is a lady killer...but even more so, it makes others wish and dream....and lust for it (as I know I did ever since I was 13 years old in the summer of 69).  Enjoy this car; at any speed it is wonderful to drive; it is solid as all German engineered cars are...it is a prestige vehicle so get used to gawking onlookers and being treated differently everywhere you go....I so love being a non-smug Porsche 911 owner.  The Porsche gets me into circles I normally avoid, and my personality wins me over with people I never thought would be friends...the car says something about the person...and it gives the person, the opportunity to say something about himself as well....I dont feel that I am materialistic, but to own this true dream car, is a feeling in and of itself.  Pride, happiness, and love poor out of this car right into your soul....it makes a person better....to own and drive such a 911...We are not snobs, we owners of this spirited machine, we are merely the keepers of the keys for a short period of time while we are on this orb.....if you can afford it, and even if you cant, life is to short NOT to drive and own a Porsche 911....and yes, they do have cup holders!

Had another Porsche 911 manual transmission about 10 year ago, awesome.  I have not had one problem with my new Porsche until a few days ago.  Took my Porsche in for oil change and to get the rims cleaned up.  I get a call two days later from my service rep telling me they are having an issue with the transmission.  Not sure what happened but the car won't move, no P, D or anything.  Everyone at the dealer and Porsche working on it but they are not sure what happened.   The transmission was perfect when I took it in for service, no signs of any transmission issues before this.  I'm so upset.  Anyone out there, anyone have any issues with their transmission on a new Porsche 911?  I need some ammunition here if I'm to deal with Porsche.   Thanks

porsche,911,2015,Mark A, 08/24/2020,Drive It Deliberately,5,"Every hear of my 2015 Porsche 911 991.1 Carrera 4S winds so smooth and so tight it begs you to press the accelerator and progress towards the 7th gear of my 7 speed manual gearbox. Don’t you dare think that 7th fear is only there to help you save gas or that it was added because if regulations passed having to do with emissions or fuel economy, no it is only there to allow the car to go faster.  Yes it is true that at 90mph in 7th gear the RPMs are below 3k, yet the car does not drive or sound in that gear as if it has fallen on its face instead the immediate without hesitation to punch and take the mph into the 100s is there.  PDK changes gears 3 times before doing 30mph (I know my friend has a 2017 with PDK) I on the other hand am still pushing 1st gear being no where near the redline in the Rev range.  The 991 911 is the most beautiful of them all, with the most toys inside to play with.  This is my third 911, I had a 1999 996 Carrera Cab, a 2005 Carrera S Cab, this one by far is the best, there is no longer any need to upgrade, I intend to pass it on to my son when I die, I am attempting even now to teach him to respect this fine tuned machine as I do.  I have other vehicles which I jump in and just go, I might hit my foot on the door, I might stop at KFC and eat chicken while driving, I am care free in those cars.

porsche,911,2016,dpod4, 02/22/2016,So awesome we bought two.,5,"Last summer I was looking to buy myself a nice sporty luxury car.  I had graduated from a 2004 VW R32 (amazing car), and wanted something a more refined.  I received lots of advice and opinions and looked at Maserati, Aston Martin, BMW, Cadillac, Ferrari, etc.  It struck me that every dealer and person who I got advice from kept comparing their cars to Porsche, especially the 911.   One guy I know has an airplane hanger where he stores his numerous cars.  He told me his two favorites were Ferrari 458 and Porsche 911 Turbo S.  So off to Porsche I went.  Drove a base 911 and thought it handled really well but didn't blow me away.  Was told I needed to try Turbo or Turbo S.  Which I did.  I was blown away.  Perfect gestalt of a driving experience.  Bought the Turbo S.  Scary fast.  Like a rocketship.  Have since bought two (one for my wife) Targa 4 GTS 911s.  Not a rocket but plenty fast -- extra 30hp and torque does make a significant difference, and suspension, height, and other tuning make for thrilling ride.  Last of naturally aspirated engines, which with top down, makes for the most visceral and enjoyable daily driver when the weather is good.  Love the Targa top (don't like soft top convertibles), and the aesthetic of the Targa (classic and modern at once).  For me whether a Turbo S or GTS naturally aspirated is perfection reached.

porsche,911,2016,Mazzo Davjide, 11/13/2015,Feels Like an Audi S4 But Looks Better,3,"The power in the base engine is nothing special. The ride is terrific with sharp handling that is not too hard. The drive feels just like my 2015 Audi S4 with a manual transmission. Turn the stop start function off. It makes for a jerky ride. If you are already spending this kind of money on a Carrera, just spend the extra bucks for an S with a larger engine and more torque. In fact, the S pretty much drives the same as a GTS. I see no real advantage of the GTS except that it will probably maintain its value better. Technology is poor for these cars. Value is all in the engineering and the drive. It is not in the technology or the interior.

No sunroof to reduce weight and keep the center of gravity closer to the pavement. I drive the car daily. Very comfortable (if you're not overweight), but not soft on the road. If you want soft, get an old Cadillac. The new turbo motor actually gives better low-end power than previous 911s, allowing one to exit corners swiftly. Little lag in Normal mode, but non-existent in Sports mode or the track-worthy Sports Plus mode. Whistling, swooshing, and rumbly exhaust every time there's a downshift is downright addictive. Steering, perfect. Visibility, perfect. Handling, perfect. My third Porsche. I've owned all the following: Audi R8 V10, Lambo Gallardo, Aston Vanquish, Viper, Lotus Elise, M6, but the new 911 gives me the thrill of a near-supercar on a daily basis.

Loved it with top down, but concerning blind spots with top up, particularly difficult to park without rear view camera. Targa reintroduced shortly after my '14 purchase; loved the lines on that car from first glance. Took delivery of a stunning graphite grey/white '17 Targa 4S last week. Amazing how different this new car is. Instant throttle response from any RPM, tracks even better than the '14, and new blind spot warning system coupled with rear view camera has removed any slight issues I had with the '14. A pleasure to drive whether softly cruising or driving hard. A true sport car that is an able touring driver combines to make an overall driving experience unlike any other.

Beautiful interior—very good 18-way cooled seats. 
Excellent soft top operation and quality. 
Excellent room for tall (6’ 3”) and broad men. 
Engine sound and power on the S model are fantastic. 
I drove the C4S and didn’t like the “plowing” / handling. 
Visibility is great too down and not bad at all with the top up provided the mirrors are properly positioned. 
Maintenance is on you—but oil changes are convenient—air filter change is cumbersome and requires rear fender removal. 
Driving with the top down is pleasant with great aerodynamics. 
Top up driving has some road noise but very livable.

porsche,911,2017,ScottT, 04/19/2020,Overall great car,4,"I'd really give it a 4.5.  Had the car for about 5 months.  I've owned Caymans in the past and liked the mid engine layout and the more balanced handling.  The 911 is more of a GT car, a bit quieter.  Still great performance but you can definitely feel the weight in the rear.  High quality throughout though some of the tech is not great.  One bug so far with the automatic headlight control.  Fingers crossed due to Porsche history of major engine design issues; IMS bearing, bore scoring.  Don't like that there are almost no high performance all season tires available since I live where it's around 30 or below in the mornings about half the year and I'd like a high performance year round tire.  But that's not the car's fault.  Inconvenient location of USB and AUX inputs (glove box, center console).  Dash kind of cluttered due to one gauge poition being used for digital information, and the steering wheel cuts off the water and oil temp gauges.  Gauge display not configurable so you have to scroll through info you may not care about, such as g-force (be nice if that only displayed in sport mode).  Not strictly the car, but I notice that a lot of Porsches are sold with very low mileage and at auction with very little Carfax information, as mine was, which is bit worrisome.

There is room in the boot for 2 roll aboards and additional cargo space for more luggage or whatever on the drop down shelf over the rear seats.  This is a sports car folks, not a '68 Cadillac or SUV! In all other respects, the 911 S was beyond my expectations.

After 23 years with my air-cooled 993 I took delivery of the 992 4S a week ago.  Yesterday I took it up to the Angeles Crest Highway and choose ""Sport Plus."" It made me a better driver! Other Porsche drivers stopped to watch it (and to chat a bit).
The new shift lever is actually better as one merely selects from R-N-D and dials in which of the sporty options to deploy.
The electronics ARE very complex and it has taken a week to be fairly comfortable with them.  I suggest spending a lot of time with the dealer to get trained.  Maybe go back after a few days and review again. After one week I am very happy with the 992. Maybe after I have had a few months' experience my evaluation will change, but for now it is the all round best car I have ever driven.

porsche,911,2020,Chic 911, 01/17/2020,911 Thrill machine 4K update,5,"911 C2 Carrera S is everything and more than I could have wanted, The car is so enjoyable to drive that I often find myself smiling or laughing at how incredible and usable the performance is. It makes you feel like a better driver than you are.  All specifications are on line so I won't mention them however I will discuss how those number translate in the real world. O-60 and 60-0 are easily achieved without drama. The brakes are so strong that I find myself occasionally looking in the rear view mirror hoping the car behind me left enough braking room. 4 wheel steering is a must purchase option. Lane changes at highway speeds and above are telepathic, no body lean, no upset to the chassis, just rock solid performance. 
Interior is pleasant but not luxurious considering the price. Sound levels are rather high at around town speeds but fade away on the highway. Storage is adequate thanks to the small back seat which can never be used for a human over 4 ft tall. I have noticed when the temp drops below 45 degrees the tires have a hard time keeping contact during rapid acceleration from stand still. This is typical of summer tires however makes me think maybe I should have opted for the 4S.  
Update...Car now has 4K miles . Still agree with my original review. Had the car on the track finally and it was superb. Few stock vehicles can keep up with it. Steering feedback is excellent, you can feel when your approaching the limits of adhesion. Brakes are powerful. I could late brake into a turn well after other vehicles were on their binders.  Rained in the afternoon which gave me the opportunity to test wet mode on the track.  Once again the car amazes. All but 2 cars pitted during the storm but my Porsche felt planted.  You can't imagine the performance capability of this vehicle until you bring it to the track.

porsche,911,2020,Porsche convert, 09/06/2020,Great car,5,"I had the new mid-engine corvette convertible on order but due to supplier issue, kept on getting pushed backed.   GM did say they will produce 2020 vettes into December if needed, however had little to no communication with their customers concerning build dates.  Not wanting to pay full price for a car that's basically one year old, I decided to go for the gusto and spring for a new Porsche 911 Cabriolet.   The car is fun to drive and has excellent build quality.   The only problem I have had so far is I cannot get the Homelink to open the gate to my community and was told to take it to my local  Porsche dealership for help, and the MMI system could be much more user friendly.  This is nothing compared tothe vette which has had transmissions with debris, fit and finish problems and computer problems to name a few.   In the long run, the decision to get the 911 was the right one for me.

away. On weekends, the transmission

Like almost everything about the car. 
It is everything I hoped for and more. 
Power is great and it handles the dirt

roll.Acceleration is quick and on 
demand.With its rigid body,high ground 
clearance and a high,low range gear 
combined with a lockable

that it is a true off roader. It is 
90% close to a 911(Can anyone really

Space is not abundant, but the trade off is 
performance and handling.  Not may creature 
comforts, save that for Lexus!.  The
Cayenne handles like a 3000 lb coupe and
not a 5000 lb truck.  The 6-speed tip is
fun, but in automatic mode, the shift
points are at lower RPMs and you can easily 
lose torque.  The 6-speed auto doesn't
really save on gas either.  At highway
speeds the Cayenne S is rock solid and
cruises easily over 100 mph with room to
spare.  X-5 has more refined ride, but
more sway as well.  The Cayenne S is the
sports version of the VW Toureg which is
$15K less for the V-8 version with air
suspension"

I don't have the space or luxury to 
have a week-end car anymore.  The 
Cayenne is an excellent daily driver 
with all the uniqueness of a Porsche.  
It has been quite the head turner, and 
not many cars are able to pass it on 
the highway.  If you love Porsches and 
need the extra room, this car was made 
exactly for you.  I am ecstatic with it."
porsche,cayenne,2003,griffen99, 04/04/2003,my cayenne,4,"should i by a sports car or an SUV?  
don't settle, buy a Cayenne. While I 
have had it for less than one month, 
this vehicle is awesome. Handles like 
nothing else out there, I have the ""S"", 
and the 340HP is GREAT. Sure I'd rather 
havve 450HP, but this works just fine. 
Thye took there time and gave us a 
GREAT SUV.  X5 doesnt even come close."
porsche,cayenne,2003,yogidoc, 04/13/2003,WHAT A CHANGE FROM A LANDROVER,4,"I've been driving Discovery's for past 
7 years.Looking for an suv with 
an edge and a sports car ride. The x-
5's are everywhere-decided on the  
cayenne over the  infiniti fx 45 which 
drove great but the look was too odd.I 
love the look of the cayenne(low key 
and aggressive)  
However driving around Boston 
gives your body quite the jarring.My 
other disappointment was the quality 
and comfort of the seats. From a 
chiropractor's perspective think twice 
before purchasing if you have any back 
problems. Landrover was MUCH MORE 
COMFORTABLE! But i guess that's the 
trade off for a sports car ride."

it!!"

SUVs.  After owning this vehicle for 
only 2 weeks, I had little trouble 
letting my 2002 C4S (my most favorite 
car EVER) go to the secondary market.  
I'd like to see ANY other 
manufacturer's vehicle hold the resale 
value that the C4S brought in the 
secondary market.  While the Cayenne 
may not be all things to all people, it 
serves ALL of my transportation needs 
while providing a great value 
proposition."

accelerates better than the ""S"", 
although S was not too bad. My other 
car is a 410 hp Stillen Suburban, but 
it cannot touch the turbo in speed, 
cornering or fun. Turbo drives like a 
sports car, and then climbs like an 
true 4x4. Stillen is for camping or 
cruising with lots of people/luggage.  "

the 15 people who ""begged"" for a spin. 
After 1000 miles its sound changes 
noticeably -- may I dare to say like a 
tiger? really cool. Great looks too: 
get it black inside black outside -- 
the ""only"" combination that works I 
think. Very aggressive looks. GPS 
system is amazing. Tiptronic is fun.

having with a vehicle. It drives 
fantastic, handles very well, very

stares from everyone. You sit nice and 
high, but never feel like it's going to 
roll or loose control even when you 
throw it around. The power is great, 
but the tiptronic sometimes puts it in 
6 gear too quickly. Too many options to 
choose from, and some options should be 
standard, but after 2K miles I am 
hooked big time, and sometimes leave

Cayenne."

A huge pleasure to drive! One worry was mpg but to my surprise it really gets 21 mpg on the highway at 65 ans cruising. Yes there are some bugs like the radio that doesn`t always work but overall I got a $70,000 car for well under 20 grand. One piece of adviceis
to verify how the car was maintained and by who."

herky jerky and the brakes squeak.  
Three months ago I asked the dealership

offered $30K less than I paid for it,

porsche,cayenne,2004,mts, 03/12/2005,"Fun SUV, but lots of bugs",3,"This SUV drives more like a sports sedan than an SUV.  It is an absolute blast to drive on a daily basis.  I also use it to tow my racecar to the track and with its 7,700 towing capacity there are very few if any competing vehicles that has both of these qualities.  It has excellent brakes and the V6, thought not a speed demond like the S and turbo models, does quite well and will be more than adequate for most owners.  The downside to this vehicle is it comes stuffed with plenty of build quality bugs.  Most are only annoyances, but they are still completely unacceptable for a premium brand like Porsche.  If you can overlook these small problems it may be for you. Otherwise look elsewhere."

Lousy gas mileage, more like 12/15. But for some reason when I get it above 80 my mileage improves to about 18. Too bad I can't stay at those speeds for very long."

Over 10,000 grand in 2 months. The passenger brake goes constantly and the radio everyone I spoke to says they have issues with it. If I had to do it over I WOULD NOT GET THIS. Looks are good but so not worth the money. I could have bought a new car for 10 grand. The headlights are like 1,000 just to replace no spare tire. Batteries are like $500 Very costly to say the least."

I own three old Corvettes and a 356 Porsche and they are just a lot of fun to drive.  A year ago I had the opportunity to sell a Cayenne Turbo for a friend and I had the car for about a month and only had to drive it three times to be HOOKED.

to be distinctive and to create 
comments from other drivers!  Expensive 
to maintain with oil changes at the

This is my first time off road and the view from my beige leather interior perfectly compliments the dust and sunset outside. Driving on the playa up to 80 mph was like being in a James Bond movie, and when winding up or down the hills was like being in Harry Potter movie where road appears just in front of me by inch.  Couple of times, it seems we could have stuck in mud, but with 'long lock' the car just pull itself off effortlessly.  We also enjoyed drinving on mini-playas whose surface are so smooth without a single crack."

They both have great handling in all situations. The power of the Cayenne is remarkable and it is a joy to drive at high speeds. The Cayenne Turbo ""eats"" rubber with tires, all four lasting only about 6,000 miles. This appears to be typical of this model and it doesn't matter whether it has winter or summer tires - they all get eaten up by just cruising. I've tried Pirelli, Michelin, Continental and all the same wear problem - they wear out far too soon. Also, it is difficult and time consuming to get the rear seats down - but the drive and handling are far superior to any SUV I've ever driven."

For its size, it should not be possible to move as efficiently when prompted by the right, or even the left, pedal. Interior is beautiful. Nice lines and great color of black with aluminum accents, very sporting. Really do enjoy driving this car every day. Often take this car out on trips over the 996, and not due to the weather. So glad that we decided on Porsche over the VW. Extra payment well worth knowing I'm driving the best of the best. No regrets. Great handling in wet weather. "

It is fun to drive and you do not get tired driving the car for long distances.  I am satisfied with my ownership and driving the Cayenne.
porsche,cayenne,2004,ATAWAY, 08/24/2009,Sports car-like handling in 5k lb truck!,4,"This vehicle continues to amaze me. Braking is second to none. Handling for a large vehicle as this is world- class. How'd they do it is what you'll wonder when you drive it. V8 power is more than sufficient, would not recommend V6 unless you are only picking up groceries and live in snow country. Ride is comfy, not too noisy, plenty of great lux features to please anyone. Beautiful design. Interior is lovely. Faux leather dash is quite nice. Seats offer plenty of adjustments. Nav works really well! Parking sensors are well worth the $. Don't need heated seats as in Southern CA not too cold."
porsche,cayenne,2004,Driver, 02/04/2005,I hope you like spending $.,4,"Overall, I can't complain, but I am rather dissapointed. In my opinion, for an oil change to take over an hour (resulting in a bill of over $200) is unacceptable. This problem could be fixed by better design of the underbody allowing for easier basic maintnence. In addition, Tiptronic system sometimes kicks in at random. I was dissapointed when I learned that I had to get a completely different WHEEL to get a snow tire. I espescially do not like the image that I payed $70,000 for my car. Buying Premium gas constantly gets very old, very fast. Also, my familly constantly reminds me of the fact that it looks like a rollerskate. If you like spending money and driving is all you care about go for it"

porsche,cayenne,2004,Peter Pivko, 12/24/2007,Long term observations,3,Mileage is 18 highway at best due to the excessive weight of the car and the big V-8.

I like driving the car, but I've had a lemon and after wrestling with it for three years, I'm giving up.  Three Porsche dealers within 1 hr and I'm on a first name basis with each.  I've read other posts and it would appear that '05 or newer might be the fix, but this vehicle has been a nightmare from day one.  Fun to drive, and GREAT control in winter weather.  Also I would be remiss if I didn't say, I was disappointed in the 6 cyl.  I went that way for fuel efficiency and it does well.  It's just to much of a sacrifice to give up the 8 cyl."

ease up hill. Points like a sport car 
on the track (it does have a LOT more 
mass, though).With active suspension 
it was surprising to see how little 
body roll there is when cornering at 
speed. Off road and in mud and snow 
the high performance tires are 
useless, however. Mine came with 20"" 
tires that are great in any condition 
except snow. In the snow I would 
recommend the Dunlop WT M2 tires 
235/60/R18.  No technical or

Up until this point, everything 
was ""under warranty."" Suddenly, when I 
took the Cayenne infor an oil change &

quality is fantastic, the look and 
feel is great, it's fun to drive, is 
safe and practical, if also a little

The ride quality is a little stiff,

until I drove home one night in the ice 
and snow in my old Land Rover Discovery 
and decided I needed all wheel drive.  
I drove the Cayenne S the next week and 
my decision was made.  It is great to 
drive and feels like a sedan.  Although 
no turbo, I feel the power is ample.  
All the kids fit in well.  The stereo 
is awesome with the surround sound

I may want to trade in my 911

is a beast.  But in normal traffic it 
purrs like a tame feline.  The Turbo is 
truly the best auto on the road.  Fast, 
fun, big, nimble and it can even pull 
my boat.  I got it when my previous S 
version blew a cylinder and they agreed 
to give it to me for 89,000 down from 
99,900.  Best deal I have ever made.

My wife has the BMW X-5 and my car 
outperforms hers in everythig.  The

what I expected.  I compared mine to 
the one the Mercedez 500 SL 
convertible and the Cadillac Escalade 
have, and it's much better (my co-

complain about in regards to this car."
porsche,cayenne,2004,Dan, 09/19/2010,Poor Reliability,3,Parking Brake broke after a few tries. Replaced transmission drive at 40K miles and gear shift really poorly. Climate Control awful making so much noise. LED dashboard was so bad that needed to replace as warranty item. Sun Glasses box broke and cost $250. Oil change or minor maint. is very expensive. I wouldn't buy it if given second chance. Stylist and good performance but reliability is not in the design process. Beside the design for perf. must take reliability and cost-efficient sustainability seriously. Good name Porsche is tainted.

Like others, I did have alignment issues in the first 8,000 miles which cost me $350 for the alignment and $1,200 for new tires (I didn't buy them from the dealer). The car is still having issues and Porsche has given up on fixing them because they don't know how to. I was told they would buy it back from me but after 4 weeks, they decided not to.

I carefully maintained the car with oil changes every 7 to 10K miles, transmission fluid at 80K and the car was not driven hard.
Overall the Cayenne was great to drive but extremely expensive to maintain, numerous brake jobs and sets of tires.

The real disappointment was this past week after 9 years and 121K miles the engine failed.
The issue was a cylinder scoring leading to failure of cylinder one.
The Cayenne engine can not be rebuilt and a replacement engine is about $22K installed, used engines are about $8k installed.

Upon searching the web the engine failure is not unique and it seems like it is a major issue with old Cayennes."

performance (170mph top speed), over 
the road comfort, off-road 
functionality, and sheer driving fun.  
Fast and responsive as many of the 
world's most exotic sports cars, 
smoother and quieter than most luxury 
sedans, and with the hauling

stands alone in its ability to be 
everything one could want, except for

Porsche is larger in overall size, 
there is significantly less head room 
in the Porsche cargo space, the rear 
window only goes down half way and the

shifting is worthless. Passengers 
complaints about whiplash are common. 
Functionality leaves allot to be 
desired. Finally, the car feels over 
engineered and several of the ordinary 
features do not function properly. 
(four visits to the dealer have not 
fixed the problems) For a vehicle of $ 
65K, you better reevaluate your 
expectations!

grew tired of the typical looks of a ""soccer-mom""

a while; however, after driving the Cayenne 
Tiptronic V6, I concluded that it was worth saving 
the $10,000 difference between the V8 and the V6 
models, and thus opted for the Cayenne Tiptronic 
V6; what a great choice!   You gotta love the 
performance, and the sound of the exhaust!

Touraeg- (a great car) yet, I 
could've had a V8 for the same money 
as this V6; yet it just didn't stir my 
soul. So far,zero disappointments.  
Joy is found in taking freeway exit 
ramps at almost double the posted 
speed with little muss or fuss.  The 
engine sound is intoxicating.  Because 
of that I use Tiptronic quite often as 
the automatic mode shifts too soon for 
my taste. One sees 6th at 40-45 MPH.  
Because of my driving habits, mileage 
is low (13-14 MPG). The ""rarity"" of 
this vehicle, a refreshing site in a 
sea of single occupied behemoths. The 
looks it receives are amazing.  "

Not for your average Family SUV.  This

off, stops on a dime, corners like no

terrible, but if you can afford the 
turbo, gas mileage cannot be an issue,

porsche,cayenne,2004,thebest2004, 07/24/2004,Best SUV on the market,4,"Built like a tank. Anyone who claims 
it is underpowered clearly had never 
driven it before. Softer ride than V8. 
Turn PSM off and it can race with any 
exotic cars out there. The Cayenne 
series out there are the best SUVs in 
the market now. It provides 
conveniences of an SUV and performance 
of Boxter/911. Truly an engineering 
marvel. Lots of technology built into 
it. Very powerful brake, even better 
than the X3's. Lastly, it is similar 
to the VW Touraeg, but DIFFERENT. 
Sportier ride, and better engine 
throttle response. Porsche revised it 
to the point that it's different than 
the V6 in the VW. Don't believe me? Go 
test drive both vehicles yourself."

find the cause of). I traded it in for 
the Porsche and have found that you can 
have it all. It drives like a sports

Great acceleration, drop the steering

Just can't imagine what the turbo is 
like.

Handling, better than most sport cars

driven.  Ride is a bit choppy, but 
thats what makes a 5000 lb SUV carve a 
cloverleaf at 55 mph.  Quiet even at 
highway speed (somewhat dependent on 
road surface)

Reliability, I have had zero problems

great.  Love the sound system and GPS

porsche,cayenne,2004,MikeD92, 10/09/2004,Love My Cayenne,4,"My first experience with a Porsche was 
when my buddy brought his Cayenne S 
overf to my home to see.  I immediately 
took to the car because of the styling, 
the well thought out design, and 
comfort. I went to the dealership the 
next day and bought my Turbo; I love my 
SUV more than my CL55, everything works 
better, it's more fun to drive, and 
after installing Satellite TV, the 
family likes road trips in it as well. 
Super highway car and very comfortable. 
I highly recommend the Cayenne!"

keyless entry and I get locked out of 
my car and I have to use the key and 
then my alarm will go off. It will only 
open 1 door when it works and it is 
just a pain. I have had it in for 
repair and recalls for the seat belts. 
I only have 6000 miles on it and I wish 
they would just fix the problem once

porsche,cayenne,2004,JoeBatters, 10/18/2004,Habit Forming,4,"Recently purchased cayenne s, after 
driving mercedes for years it was time 
to say good bye to the three pointed 
star. i test drove all of the top line 
suv's and just could not see driving 
anything other then this porsche. the 
quality is great so far, i like how 
porsche is not trying to appeal to all 
segments of the car buying population. 

we have been so impressed and happy 
with the purchase we just ordered a 
second for my wife. this vehicle is 
nice to get into and leave any stress 
behind.also, when merging onto the 
interstate and no one wants to let you 
in just tap this gas pedal and you are 
catapulted forward into a clear area.

This is just a great ride."

had a few problems with my nav system. 
Other than that it is a beast, but be 
prepared not pass up many gas stations.

I wouldn't waste my time or money on 
the V6. If you can afford the turbo, 
you won't be sorry, however my S runs 
with the best of them."
porsche,cayenne,2004,rdufer, 10/25/2004,A Quiet Beast,4,"There isn't any way to rationalze the 
purchase of this car-unless you have 
driven one! The power is unending just 
depress the accelerator and it just 
keeps coming. The only thing better 
than the power is the brakes and 
handling! The interior is beautiful and 
very quiet unless of course you turn on 
the wonderful sound system! This is the 
first SUV we have had that my wife 
actually wants to drive. Is it perfect, 
no, but did I mention the power.....it 
makes you forget any other short 
comings! The electronics are 
complicated and it took me a while to 
work them all out, but once set you 
just enjoy. It does like fuel in the 
city but averaged 19.6 on a road trip."

2005 model.  I had 3 BMWs and 
many japanese cars and SUVs 
before but Cayenne is the best so

better."

porsche,cayenne,2004,Porsche owner, 03/05/2005,V6 Cayenne,3,"Purchased as an intended economical second car.  Paid $39K for stripped model with heated seated/steering wheel. Compared against BMW, Volvo, and Audi and decided on Porsche SUV.   Just hit 10K and car has been very reliable and solid to drive.  Since this car is not widely owned, you do receive many inquisitive looks and comments; but these come at a price.  You are forced to have the car serviced at a Porsche dealership.  First service light came on at 10K miles (even though book states first oil change at 20K), and it cost $250"
porsche,cayenne,2004,Porsche convert, 03/10/2005,best car ever,4,Great fun to drive in all weather. Extremely sure footed and responsive. No problem driving thru 2 blizzards. I find my journeys take longer as I find excuses to go the long way round.

porsche,cayenne,2004,satchmo, 07/19/2005,impressive,4,I drove BMW'S for years this is my second porsche and it has met all of my expectations and needs Handles like a dream awsume stereo system and a nav systems that can take you to the moon most people complain about no spare tire New flash folks they have a new thing called road side assistance use it. it is free from porsche and most of you who pay attention to your auto insurance policies will notice you have it also wrapped up in there for free in a package.      
porsche,cayenne,2004,mudman2, 09/17/2005,What a change,5,"I moved from a Mercedes-Benz ML 430 to the Porsche Cayenne S mainly because my wife and daughter convinced me I was worth it.  It is a stunning vehicle, the first I have owned that has been improved by the dealer using software upgrades since I bought it.  I now have 35,000 miles on it and love it more now than I did when I first picked it up, another first.  It's frighteningly fast when ""driven.""  Most other drivers continually underestimate just how quick it is.  The harder you push it, the more it gives, it never runs out of steam."
porsche,cayenne,2004,cayennes, 09/16/2006,A Driver's SUV,4,"I got my Porsche Cayenne S over the BMW X5 4.4i.  In addition to all the precision in handling and world class performance - this SUV is very quiet to cruise around in.  The revised 0-60 mph figure of 6.8 seconds is very conservative IMHO.  It probably can out run 70% of the sports car on the road and at the same time, I have carried 8 tires (255/55 18) with the rear seats folded down.  I have had no problems at all with the snow tires and winter driving / skiing trips, etc.  Theh Cayenne is the king of SUV hands down!  If you get the Turbo or the Turbo S, you can probably outrun 90-99% of the sports car out there."
porsche,cayenne,2004,Scott , 01/05/2007,What Fun,4,"I have had the '04 Cayenne S for two months and it has exceeded my expectations.  The vehicle is a blast to drive and handles great.  The fact that it can handle like a sports sedan and still be an SUV is amazing.  I have had a couple of warranty repairs - a rattle and a drivetrain issue, nothing crazy for a car with 37,000 miles.  Overall I am quite pleased.  "
porsche,cayenne,2004,AA, 04/30/2007,Wonderful Machine - Cayenne S,4,"Having only owned this vehicle for a couple weeks, I already can tell you that it is fantastic. Great level of comfort and convenience from our CS. Have driven new V6 Cayenne, was not impressed with performance ('08 should be better, however) so landed in CPO CS and am so very happy. Wonderful wet weather handling. Feels much lighter than its stats would suggest. Massive brakes also instill confidence and superb braking ability (L.A. accident avoidance maneuver proves it). Recommend fully."
porsche,cayenne,2004,DoktorT, 11/23/2007,Hedonism on wheels,4,"I am a true porschephile, but the nose never realy worked for me and I actually prefer the looks of the Touerag.   Then I drove it.  End of story.  I own a dozen porsche 911s, and a couple of turbos, and this is fast.  It also handles suprisingly well.  It's possible to get 21MPG on the highway if you can keep it under 70 and keep the cruise on.  I did this for a short while after picking the car up in tampa and driving it 1000 miles home.  I found that I could cruise at 75-80 with ocasional burts up to 100 and still keep avg MPG at 19.4.  Well worth it for the fun factor.  This car is loaded.  It has taken me 2 days to learn the nav audio system but now it seems intuitive. A blast!"

On a ski trip to Mammoth from LA the transmission has gotten stuck in low range.

It wont move up to give me a limited differential and it wont move down to road mode.
If I try the 307 mile journey home I have to do it at 50mph.

I googled the issue and now find that its a common problem.
Porsche roadside assistance is coming tomorrow to get it but wont tow it back to LA only to Fresno.

Porsche have totally let ,me down."

Make sure your Cayenne has the best headlights made. I'm very disappointed in the standard headlights. This is not a very large SUV, the interior room is only fair. Keep in mind if you look to go off road that the stock tires are not designed for it. My final conclusion is that this is a 911 with a SUV Body. It is a lot of fun to drive!"
porsche,cayenne,2005,Ethan, 06/23/2006,The Ultimate SUV,4,"I purchased a used but untitled Porsche Cayenne Turbo about 8 months ago. I have put approximately 10,000 miles on it (it previously had 5,000). It has had absolutely no problems. Its acceleration and handling are on par with most sport cars. Its off-road handling is also excellent. The adjustable ride height is a must if you plan to do any significant off-road driving.  However, this option also improves daily driving, allowing you to set a fairly low, more car-like ride height. "
porsche,cayenne,2005,Ethan, 12/17/2006,"Ultimate Sport ""Utility"" Vehicle",4,"The Porsche Cayenne Turbo is the ultimate ""utility"" vehicle, being extremely capable on the road, offering good performance off-road, a good towing capacity of 7,700 lbs., and feeling good doing it all.  Nothing else really compares to it. If you are not planning on taking advantage of this superb technology, I would suggest getting a BMW X5, Lexus RX350, or an Audi Q7. Most SUV owners never tow or take the vehicle off road, so save your money and shop elsewhere. Also, the Cayenne Turbo is equipped with high performance, soft Pirelli tires that wear quickly...something the customer needs to understand."
porsche,cayenne,2005,Gustavo, 09/26/2009,"Great performance, poor reliability",4,"This SUV is a dream to drive. The handling is superb and the feeling of comfort and security are incredible. However, I had to: 1. Reprogram the software several times, 2. Replace a solenoid in the transmission (hard painful ""clunk"" when decelerating), 3. Replace crankshaft because of defective rubber housing, 4. cheap plastic parts in the interior keep braking at minor touch, 5. PCM2 system screen went bad after 60,000 miles. According to the dealer and my mechanic, all of the above problems seem to be common for the 2005 model. I hope that Porsche is listening. Would I buy another Cayenne again? Absolutely yes. The pleasure of driving one far exceeds the pain of repairing it."
porsche,cayenne,2005,Mike Bement, 04/14/2005,Porche Cayenne-Great vehicle,4,This is the perfect vehicle for me.  I love the speed of a sports car.  I love the head room and storage room of an SUV. The Turbo Cayenne does it all.  It is absolutely beautiful.  Mike Bement
porsche,cayenne,2005,Nate, 08/04/2015,Really,2,"I love driving this car but Porsche should be ashamed of craftsmanship. Everything plastic has broken off, rear door will not stay open and presents hazard, ac and navigation is a joke, and maintaining vehicle even the Porsche repair shop shakes their head about how poorly designed it is. My advice pick another model.

BMW X5M or Mercedes ML65 can't come close.

Although X5 and ML63 has more power IMO but when it comes to handling nothing can compare."
porsche,cayenne,2005,Matt, 11/12/2010,Road Warrior,4,"This car is a road warrior.  I have over 100k miles on it and it still runs like it is brand new.  It loves the open road, I once drove across Nevada non stop doing well over a 100 mph and felt comfortable, stable and safe.  Will buy another one when this one wears out, could be a while."
porsche,cayenne,2005,Joe, 05/14/2005,"Porsche, mispronounced & misunderstood",4,"The Porsche Cayenne is an exciting vehicle because it is a Porsche. It goes over bumps badly and the legroom in the back could be roomier. It is awkward to get to the cup holders in the front which are too small for an average water bottle but perfect for fountain drinks or an evian. As far as driving goes it is a great ride. The speed of this vehicle is wasted on a stay at home mom such as myself. However, I bought mine for prestige alone. I am too cute for a minivan so this five seater accommodates me and my 4 kids comfortably. The looks and stares I get from people was worth the cost alone, that and the cool key. I would definately rate the Cayenne as an appropriate dream/practical car. "
porsche,cayenne,2005,bgaffney, 12/17/2004,The good and the misleading,4,"Overall it is a good vehicle. I have had it a year and do enjoy it. This car was purchased for the safety and handling features. (I had recently been in an accident where the air bags deployed.)The  handling and braking are great. I still drive my Explorer as it is easier to load things in, but if it rains this is the vehicle to be in. Unfortunately I was just notified the staged air bags that were listed on my paperwork were not available when I purchased my car (they did state that the airbags exceeded requirements but that is not enough for me). I am very concerned about that and will look for another vehicle that offers that feature. I have owned Porsches since 1964. I get 16 MPG around town."
porsche,cayenne,2005,Annette, 05/28/2005,Prefer Cayenne to X5 or ML,4,"Have owned this car for little over a month.  Is a joy to drive.  Fast and reliable - true Porsche driving in an SUV.  Have owned both a BMW X5 and a Mercedes ML 320 - Cayenne is far superior to these other two.  Gas mileage is comparable to the others.  Interior is finished beautifully - I have the aluminum finish vs. wood.  Modern and sleek.  I purchased the 20 inch sport techno wheels which make the appearance more aggressive.  Overall, a tremendous driving experience!"
porsche,cayenne,2005,Richard Daniels, 03/06/2005,Best Car I've Had,4,I've owned 7 BMW's from the 320 to the 750 and this is the best all around vehicle that I've owned.

I would have bought the turbo but it has really lag. I have taken the Cayenne off road numerous times and it has held up well. I'm very pleased with this car. Fuel economy is poor but it is a V8 and I'm coming from a V6.

Since I have 2 kids, I sold the 930 and ordered the Cayenne S.  Of course, the 930 is much quicker, but the Cayenne made me forget about missing my old love. It is so comfortable it fits like a glove. Everything is so convenient, smooth, user friendly Has grab handles where need them.  It truly makes you feel loved and special.  It has plenty of power.It handles very nimble, stops on a dime and always feels safe.  I live in the country and I have a great time eating up the roads.  I have never had one problem with my car. It has only been in the shop for an oil change and 20K service. "
porsche,cayenne,2005,Andrew C, 08/13/2005,The Homing Pigeon,3,"The Porsche Cayenne S has great driveability for an SUV but sadly we call ours the Homing Pigeon because it spends so much time in the dealer shop.  Mostly small warning light problems but also an amazing number of recalls - I think 6 to date, mostly software upgrades.  We now have a home in the Canadian boonies and unreliability plus no spare means this car is to be changed for a Lexus LX 470  To be fair the Toronto service shop has been well above average in looking after us but at the end of the day I want the car on the road, not in the shop.  BTW the 19"" tires are just horrible in snow - I bought an 18"" set of rims and dedicated winter Scorpions and then she was great."

Thank goodness for the Cayenne. It has plenty of room for the field hocky sticks and gear, yet when Dad wants to recall his younger years, the performance is great.  The styling is sophisticated for a night on the town but not over done.  The acceleration and handling are truly like a sports car with the practicality and benifits of an SUV thrown in.

The best part of owning this car is driving this car. It is a fun car to drive period. The car handles and corners great. The engine sounds cool too. It actually drives like a Porsche.

Not only by its atractive exterior design but also for the performance and the response you get when you step on the pedal. If I want to feel that I control it the Triptonic option is fun because I get to control the changes . Sleek modern elegant interiors. Great sound equipment. Suspention is too hard you will feel any bump in the road double the size when moving slowly. Sometimes in the mornings it will take it some time (maybe about 5 minutes ) to heat up  to perform normally. This is a  great vehicle.

My only regret is that I did not buy the turbo version, but I thought I'd send my daughter to a year in college instead."
porsche,cayenne,2005,Linda, 02/13/2005,Love my car,5,"I was so happy with my Mercedes sedan, but didn't want a US made SUV, so I went looking.  To my surprise only two SUV's were German-made.  I tried the Porsche Cayenne and purchased the S because I like a V8 engine.  I was going to purchase a 2004 but waited for the 2005 hoping they would have an available telephone."
porsche,cayenne,2005,great suv , 02/14/2005,great suv,4,"This is a great vehicle if you are looking for a fun vehicle to drive this is it.  The Cayenne is an SUV that feels like a sports car , great on the highway and offroad. I recomend this machine to anyone. "
porsche,cayenne,2005,John C, 02/14/2005,A Tank with Speed,4,"Just purchased the Chayenne S.  Feels like you're driving an armored tank at first feel. Press the gas and you feel like you're in the cockpit of one of Porsche's fine sports cars. The thing is just so solidly built, never felt safer in any automobile.  Love the engine growl, the taught and responsive steering and it's overall great looks inside and out.  Have driven BMW, Mercedes and Audi...test drove X5, FX45 and others...the Cayenne blows their doors off.  The air suspension option is a must have.  It's a tank that turns into a rocket.  I can only imagine what the Turbo feels like!"
porsche,cayenne,2005,Lisa, 02/16/2005,Only A Porsche,4,"The only car on the road that can clearly please the owner, the passengers and the ones lucky enough to see it drive by. "
porsche,cayenne,2005,Lynnsey, 02/17/2005,Drives like a Porsche,4,"I got a nail in my tire and had a flat at 45 mph in traffic.. it still drove like a Porsche as the tire was falling off the rim!!!  It is simply amazing and so very much fun to drive or be seen in!  People are always trying to see what it is or asking questions.  It deserves all of the attention and it still is pure pleasure to drive or ride in!  WTG PORSCHE!!!  Not only am I proud of my car, it delivers on every thing a Porsche should be!  I have a Boxster as well, but this is the car that goes everywhere for every occasion!  Since it is spring, maybe the Boxster will have a better chance! Porsche is a family tradition.. because NO ONE DOES IT BETTER!  "
porsche,cayenne,2005,fcompagnino, 03/25/2005,The Car,4,This car is just a pleasure to drive also its power is amazing...i also like the luxury features
porsche,cayenne,2005,Sandra Pitoniak, 03/26/2005,Great Big 911,4,"This Cayenne is just like driving my 911 only I am setting higher off the ground and I do not feel every pebble in the road surface.  Great in the rain on slick roads and excellent handling in traffic.  Still an obscure vehicle and no one really knows what it is, which is a plus.  I like the fact that I can shift is manually.  Very glad I bought the tire/rim warranty.  Have replaced two tires already. Will keep you informed as the Porsche and I really get to know one another."
porsche,cayenne,2005,Lorene Olsen, 04/07/2005,Cayenne S,4,"I just purchased a Cayenne S last month. I have had many SUVs over the past 10 years, and this one definitely takes the cake. It feels much larger when your are inside. I love the quality that Porsche put inside and out.I also have a Cadillac Escalade with a super charger on it. It may have the power, but not the handling of the Cayenne. When you are driving it you feel like you are in a Porsche, not an SUV. The nice thing about it is you can still tow if you need to. The best of both worlds."
porsche,cayenne,2005,Ginger, 04/29/2005,"7,500 Miles, so far, in My Cayenne Turbo",4,"It is faster than my older Porsches, but does not handle as well as a 911.  On the other hand, it can cut through esses on ramps better than any vehicles other than the exotics and Porsche sports cars I encounter.  The Turbo can be a little explosive, like the old 930s, but the large engine with the 457 ft pounds of torque at 2200 rpm really hides any turbo lag.   I wish they would let me use it at a PCA track event."
porsche,cayenne,2005,Steve, 04/30/2005,May be close to Perfect,4,"This may be the closest to perfect car ever built. It has the acceleration of a sports can, and leaves all but dedicated sports cars in the dust. With all that, it is a great off road vehicle as well. It will travel in all kinds of environments, and you dont have to worry about going off road, something you cant do with a sports car. The interior is very nice, and it has available just about any option you want in a luxury car. So, it is a fast as a sports car, as capable as any off road vehicle, and has all the luxuries of a luxury car, all in one car. There is nothing that comes close in any car without significant compromises in at least one of these categories if you want it all in one."
porsche,cayenne,2005,markyami, 05/13/2005,quality not compromised,4,"the cayenne s is a pleasure for four out of the five senses. The looks exterior is unique to other SUV's with its defined lines and aluminum trim work, and the interior is comfortable with instrumentation placed with the driver in mind. hearing the engine when you step on the gas with the true Porsche sports car sound will bring out the kid in you. the Smell of the quality leather interior continues well into ownership. the feel is the most adrenalin rushing part of the car. Acceleration, handling, stability, and braking is every bit as sport car feel as a corvette, with a seating for five, four wheel drive, and a comfortable ride, you know you bought the best of both worlds."
porsche,cayenne,2005,Stambo, 05/19/2005,No Substitute!,4,"Bought Cayenne S as first new car in decades.Had Mercedes E 430 4matic(2001) which was destroyed in a wreck in Feb.Porsche fit and finish is outstanding.340 horses and smooth transmission transport us effortlessly.Have put 1400 miles on it and have no complaints.Has 4 seat heaters,heated steering wheel,very comfortable seating on Napa leather.My 2 big dogs,Boris and Natasha enjoy their view from the back.The Porsche dealer did all the paperwork,got my tags,etc.Got nice letters from corporate welcoming me aboard.A true class act.This is clearly an instance where you get what you pay for."
porsche,cayenne,2005,dsta, 06/12/2005,owner,5,"Outstanding experience from the moment we walked in to test drive the car to today.  The salesman, the dealership, the service departmenat, yet most important THE CAYENNE have all performed at 100% at all times to our expectations!  We researched every automobile in the marketplace. There isn't anything out there that can compete with this in safety, design, comfort, excitement, performance as well as we feel we are getting great gas mileage.  What more could a consumer ask for! Thank you for delivering a great product."
porsche,cayenne,2005,Young, 06/25/2005,The SUV looks good and is fun to drive,4,"This SUV was acquired in February 2005. It was a dream of mine and I love it (not in the habit of associating love with materialism). It looks good and handles even better. I'm really enjoying it, but Im having a seat belt problem and fine the dealer and manufacturer to be un-responsive."
porsche,cayenne,2005,Robert Riess, 07/09/2005,Best in the World,4,This is a SUV that drives like a sports car. It handles great and there are no problems...no rattles...everything is top notch
porsche,cayenne,2005,Litacher, 07/26/2005,Smooth Ride,4,"I love it! I have been a Porshe owner for many years and the Cayenne S is great.  I sold my Carrera 911 for the Cayenne S.  I wish I had done it sooner.  It is truly a joy to drive, a serious road car. I travel about 80 miles a day round trip, 5 days a week. The downside to the SUV is the gas mileage."
porsche,cayenne,2005,tammy, 07/26/2005,love it!,4,i love this car. it drives awsome and handles great in the snow and rain.
porsche,cayenne,2005,Larry Favre, 09/22/2005,Nothing Compares To You,4,"The Cayenne is without a doubt the best performing 'SUV' out there.  I put 20"" technos with 275 Michelins on mine for non-winter driving (which are specifically designed for this vehicle's suspension and rated at 186 mph) and the Cayenne is transformed to near 911 handling - what a difference, not that the 18"" 255's are bad.  These tires are a must have for the true performance seeker with $5,000 to spend on great fun.  It is hard to get my PSM to kick on, wet or dry, with these on!  Aggressive males and females will enjoy the most it has to offer.  Why bother otherwise?"
porsche,cayenne,2005,1st Time in Porsche, 01/04/2006,First Time in Porsche,4,"After driving five other so called competitors of the Cayenne it was no contest when it comes to performance.  As a Corvette driver, I have been spoiled with high end performance car but now that my wife and I will be blessed with a child...it was time to think bigger.  The Porsche SUV was not on my initial list but the more I've compared the extra few dollars can be well justified. "
porsche,cayenne,2005,fastdiablo, 04/22/2006,"Cayenne S after 14,000 miles",4,"The Porsche Cayenne has a stellar motor, taught suspension, and unreal handling for a 5,000 lb. truck.  The tiptronic shifters on the steering wheel are outstanding.  The interior fit and finish are superb, its ergonomics are comfortable, and its driving position is firm and supportive.  This truck's quality and design are German to the nth degree, which is a great thing.  The navigation and stereo are both easy to use.  The sound system is excellent.  This vehicle has lots of usable space and the back seats are spacious.  Folding the seats down could be easier though.  I've had two very small problems in 14,000 miles.  First, there was a rattle in the rear door which was a cable that became unfastened - easy fix by the dealer.  The second was that the windshield wipers were sqeaky - they were replaced by the dealer.  I have never had any mechanical issues."
porsche,cayenne,2005,alexander brown, 12/14/2004,A good vehicle that's not as pricy as you think,4,The 2005 Porsche Cayenne 6-cylinder has great power on and off road.  When it snows it is a good idea to change from the Porsche all season tires to the winter ones.  The inteior is what one would expect from a Porsche.
porsche,cayenne,2005,Milo, 12/21/2004,Amazing!!,4,"I have driven my 2005 Pirsche Cayenne Turbo beyond what the average driver would and I can say that it performed flawlessly and always left me with a comfortable feeling. What a great vehicle. If you want to own a vehicle that drives like a Porsche, can out haul a 3/4 standard equipment Chevrolet, have a great sound system (its the best that Ive heard yet in any vehicle) second to none, and have power to spare, get one of these. You wont be sorry."
porsche,cayenne,2005,MikeD, 12/31/2004,My First Long-Term Keeper,4,"Typically after nine months I am trading in my cars for something new and different to drive, typically another German sports car.  The Porsche Cayenne Turbo is my first Porsche and SUV and it drives like a real sports car, not an SUV. Everything in the car is well placed, tight, beautiful, and serves its purpose. Not only can you load the car up with options, but you can also add some of the aftermarket options as well from many makers. I have had no problems with the vehicle."
porsche,cayenne,2005,kate, 01/06/2005,Pure Pleasure,4,"Fom day one, I have not had any buyer's remorse about my Porsche Cayenne S.  It provides pure driving pleasure!  I just returned from a road trip from California to Oregon and back.  The vehicle performed wonderfully. Its steering, handling, power, Bose stereo, Navigation system, extra power from the S model, etc...  I can't wait to go on my next road trip to Canada. Thank you, Porsche!"
porsche,cayenne,2005,RL, 01/16/2005,An SUV with real performance,4,"Except for recalls, my 2005 Porsche Cayenne has been an excellent blend of luxury and performance.  It is far more luxurious than than the Land Rover Range Rover.  It gives great on and off road performance.  It comes with most of the bells and whistles that the Lexus RX 330 has, but it is not quite as luxurious.  My fuel economy has been better than expected.  This vehicle feels and drives like a Porche.  It is pretty amazing.  The downside is two different sets of tires are required.  Performance tires (obviously) can't handle the winter weather.   "
porsche,cayenne,2005,claudio dicovskiy, 01/20/2005,Family Values,4,"My Porsche Cayenne Turbo is really something.  I own an a Mercedes-Benz SL 55 a Porsche Boxster S and this SUV hangs in there niceley in performance with the added benefit that I can take my whole family for the ride!  My kids get a blast from the acceleration through a tight corner like the on ramp to the George Washington Bridge when comming from the Henry Hudson Pkwy.  It's like a roller coaster ride!  The fuel economy is notoriously bad, but one is rewarded by the thrill of driving this."
porsche,cayenne,2005,maggietrenary, 02/05/2005,porsche cayenne s,4,"This is the most fun sport utility vehicle I have ever owned. It is  race car at hear with a SUV body. I have a Carrerre 996 as well, and I like the Cayenne almost as much."
porsche,cayenne,2005,Richard, 02/05/2005,Cayenne,4,"The Cayenne is fast, fun SUV that handles as well on road as off road.  The suspension stiff which makes for excellant cornering.  The design is noticed by by-standers and received a lot of looks."
porsche,cayenne,2005,sean curley, 02/23/2005,Porsche Cayenne,5,It is a VERY fun car to drive it handles everything i throw at it very well.  Decent fuel economy for an SUV.
porsche,cayenne,2005,TimHicks66, 02/23/2005,Snap your head back,4,"I absolutely love the Cayenne Turbo I purchased.  I have had it for one year and have had no issues other than standard maintenance.  It is fun to driver and faster than anything should be for as big as it is.  It is also very practicle and has nice ""True"" SUV features."
porsche,cayenne,2005,Orca, 03/04/2005,Orca,3,"Love the vehicle overall but the ride is like a heavy truck. Local service is less than desirable. ""Can't duplicate owners complaint."" only one service in area. Milage 14.9 including highway.  Former auto a M.B. S320V so am spoiled on the smooth ride.   Won't buy another."

porsche,cayenne,2005,huron, 03/05/2005,Get a Cayenne,5,"I love the looks of this car.  Performance is cat quick.  As for handling, it's a porsche and you get what  you expect. Rock solid and built like a tank"
porsche,cayenne,2005,Ron Joffe, 03/06/2005,Owner/driver,5,Had excellent buying experience with dealer in every aspect.  The vehicle is everything we expected.  My only negative is the ride is very stiff. Vehicle has only 1600 miles on it and hopefully that will soften up a bit. 
porsche,cayenne,2005,Steve, 03/09/2005,Maybe the Perfect Vehicle,4,"This may be the perfect comprimise between a sporty car and off road vehicle, still keeping comfort in mind. The Cayenne Turbo is very fast, with pick up that does not make me miss my sports car, yet it drives off road like a Land Rover and I can take 5 large adults for a ride each having plenty of room. It has plenty of storage space for carrying groceries and has lots of luxury features, such as sunroof, satellite radio, heated seats, CD player, BOSE stereo, navigation, etc. Literally, nothing is missing, and everything is done well. I can even tow several tons behind me. The drive is comfortable and sporty and really, as I said, this maybe the perfect vehicle that does everything very well"
porsche,cayenne,2005,Felix Friedberg, 03/10/2005,Owner,4,"Fun to Drive, respect of friends and neighbors.  Good performance, good gas milage, excellent  interior, air conditioning."
porsche,cayenne,2005,dave s , 03/12/2005,drives like a sports car,4,"Apart from some minor electrical problems with the remote the car is glitch free.  I am a dad with children ages 5 and 7.  I also own a Porsche 996 Carrera.  If it is raining or I have carpool duties this car is my absolute favorite to drive.  It drives like a sports car and is plenty fast.  The true beauty of this car is its cornering stability and braking . As for acceleration and speed , I have to remind myself that high speed driving is not a good idea with young kids in tow and therefore I don't regret not buying the Turbo.  If you don't have young kids get the Turbo.  The Porsche Carrera is the best car but for rainy days and kid towing I absolutely love my Cayenne.  Get it fully loaded - don't skimp."
porsche,cayenne,2005,tommie, 03/19/2005,best one,4,This is the best SUV i have ever driven in my life!  It is better then any toyota 4 runner 
porsche,cayenne,2005,Mark S Totten, 03/23/2005,A Fun Vehicle,4,"I was torn in buying the 6 cyl over the 8 cyl ""S"" based on I felt I would lose a lot of overall performance.  Although this vehicle would primarily be used by my wife and toddler, I did look forward to taking it out from time to time to really see what it's able to do. To my surprise, even the 6 cyl had ample power and felt like a true performance vehicle.  What a nice looking SUV and so fun to drive."
porsche,cayenne,2005,porsche fan, 03/23/2005,great fun,4,"Bought this '04 turbo after driving the S model all day, then I drove the Turbo for 100"" only.   What a different car truely there is nothing like it on the road the only time I feel I am in an SUV is when I look at the gas mileage.  This is the ultimate all year around car Porsche combined a winter AWD vehicle and a high performance summer car and you still have the option of off roading with pride....If you can justify the MSRP buy this car you will never regret it."
porsche,cayenne,2005,Jerome Casper, 03/23/2005,you can have it all,4,"In the past, I needed an SUV plus a ""fun"" car, but with the Cayenne Turbo I have it all.  It's great fun to drive and I can have more than one passenger to enjoy it with.  The size is perfect."
porsche,cayenne,2005,The family Porsche, 03/24/2005,Porsche fun with family,4,"This car fills the niche of a Porsche that has the performance and feel of a sports car that the whole family can enjoy.  People give me a puzzled look at the car because they do not know what it is. It has a solid feel with an incredible Porsche handling. Just returned from a 3,000 mile trip.  The car was very comfortable, quiet, even with all the horses purring.  At the end of long day of driving, I was not fatiqued due to the comfortable seats with lumbar support and the excellent sound system. Heavy snow is no match for this car even without using the low range.  This car is definately a winner. "
porsche,cayenne,2005,D'Art, 04/02/2005,Yippee Cayenne!,4,"Came out of an LX470 and was reborn again to my sports car roots but with utilitarian value. Drives better than most sports cars, but I can put the tennis ball machine, 2 buckets and equipment bag in back no problem! I can load the kids on weekends now when the wife has something else to do. Have had it in deep water up to lights and gone over the side of freeway to get out of a jam. "
porsche,cayenne,2005,Porsche , 04/24/2005,Reliablity down the drain,3,"Beautiful and nice and fun to drive, that's if it wasn't at the dealer most of the time for repairs, reliablity sucks, other than that its pretty fun, you should consider the FX 45, faster and better reliablity"
porsche,cayenne,2005,Dan Kohn, 04/25/2005,Great handling SUV,4,"I have just moved up from a Freelander, which also is a very good handling car.  The Cayenne is far more responsive and fun to drive."
porsche,cayenne,2005,jminco, 04/28/2005,Porsche SUV Fills Out my Garage,4,"Every year when winter sets in and I put in storage my 911 Carrera 4S I would wish I could find an SUV that would drive similar to my 911 and at last I have.  Not to be confused with the performance of a 911 the Cayenne S fills out my seasonal needs better then the 5 other SUV's I have owned,  which include (2) Toyota Land Cruisers,  Lexus Lx 470, and (2) BMW X5's.  The handling and performance are Porsche familiar.  I to was an advocate of Porsche not building an SUV until I got one as a loaner during service on my 911, that very next day I purchased one for myself.  I would recommend any true Porsche fan to try one on before you judge it on the Porsche Legacy alone."
porsche,cayenne,2005,big c, 05/26/2005,awesome!!!!!,4,"just got it great handling ,awesome breaks good firm ride . Pricey but hey its a porsche, stereo could be simpler to use but sounds good.Only Problem is 6-cylinder eng. very slow off the line but great at speed. Now im onto th fx 35 so i can have the two best looking suv's on the planet."
porsche,cayenne,2005,cayenne, 06/22/2005,Beautiful but a little let down,4,"The cayenne is a rare find in a sea of similar SUV's. That being said, the fuel economy is horrible; especially for such a fun car to drive. On average it would run me approximately $60-$80 dollars per week if I drove the car daily. I'm just consdering it my showpiece at this point because of the high cost of gas. "
porsche,cayenne,2005,Eddie Bishop, 07/06/2005,Go 4 It,4,"Awesome car... So much fun to drive ... Others come up and ask  "" hey what is it ? ""  LOts of looks and cool comments"
porsche,cayenne,2005,mabell, 07/19/2005,Just got to drive one to be hooked,4,"Downsized from an Excursion.  Wasn't really looking for this car but once you drive her, you will be hooked.  It's really hard not to push her on the roads, she responds fast.  Had a radar detector installed so I have only had her up to 120 but she still had power to spare.  Love the interior, I opted for the exterior mounted tire which I think makes her sportier. Gas mileage is around 13 mpg but didn't buy her for the gas mileage but still gets more than an excursion.  Handles every bit as well as a Porsche should especially since its an SUV.  Go drive one if in doubt and its nice not to see yourself coming and going like all the other luxury SUV'S."
porsche,cayenne,2005,Hot Pepper, 07/31/2005,A true Porsche,4,"My wife says this is the only SUV I could've bought; and it's true! Good performance with great handling keeps alive fine Porsche heritage. Manual 6-speed is the only way I'd buy this vehicle, just wish it'd be the V8. Not to take anything away from the Tiptronic, but this is a drivers car, shift it yourself. Not that my wife minds being a passenger - she definitely doesn't. Firm, stable, & comfortable, not floatly; just what I expected. Good hauling capacity - not the biggest in the SUV world, but just fine for our needs. Friends & neighbors love the looks & it always gets positive comments. Installed Porsche factory bike carrier on roof - no wind noise at all. Gotta drive it to enjoy it."
porsche,cayenne,2005,Thinking, 08/20/2005,Sweet Ride,4,"No complaints at all 2,000+ miles in.  Looked at Caddy SRX, 2006 Mercedes ML350, Lexus RX330 and others. Rides great and it gets a lot of second looks (you don't see one every 10 yards like the Lexus). You can tell its well constructed -- manufactured in Germany -- not like the Mercedes (Alabama). Fantastic dealer experience."
porsche,cayenne,2005,CrimsonPepper, 09/08/2005,One Zesty Pepper,4,"This is my first Porsche but not my first SUV.  Have had the Yukon, Acura MDX, Lexus LX 470, Cadillac Escalade and desired something sporty with SUV traits.  I test drove an S but wanted the extra punch of the Turbo.  The dealership worked hard to meet my price demands and satisfaction.  This truck is very controllable at all speeds (even at 120).  Its engine begs to cowl for you and to be driven fast.   I would not advise the Turbo for my wife or a soccer Mom...stick with the S or V6.  Mine has burned about a quart of oil since purchase which is consistent to what dealership advised based on how often you lay into the turbo boost.  My kids love being dropped off at school in it because most don't know what it is.  Much fun!"
porsche,cayenne,2005,dsippin, 09/16/2005,Great Vehicle,5,"Have owned my 2005 Cayenne S for seven months now and could not be happier. I have had absolutely no problems except that the navigation system stopped working right after purchase, the dealer replaced entire PCM system. It is the best handling vehicle that I have ever owned, although ride is a little stiff for touring.  I wish I got the adjustable air suspenson option.  The V8 engine is fabulous, smooth, and has excellent acceration. It gets acceptable gas mileage. The PCM system with navigation, satellite radio, and Bose sound system are all top notch, although the navigation system is more difficult to use than Acura system. I am happy that I purchased mine with the smooth leather and burl wood options.  It has beautiful fit and finish. All in all - this is an excellent vehicle!"
porsche,cayenne,2005,Lori from Las Vegas, 10/19/2005,Awesome car,4,"I know that this is considered an SUV, but I think of it more as a car.  I have owned many SUVs over the past ten years.  I must have an SUV because I occasionally pull a trailer.  I have pulled my boat behind it and it pulls great.  My dream car was someday owning a Porsche.  When your family grows, reality comes into play.  With this SUV you can have the best of both worlds.  I have owned every other high line SUV and nothing compares to the precision handling that you will experience in the Cayenne."
porsche,cayenne,2005,Dave S., 11/02/2005,Accept No Substitute,4,"I had an Infiniti FX35 Infiniti before my Porsche Cayenne.  The FX was definitely faster for a V6, but I still think overall it cannot touch the Cayenne for looks or attention to detail. "
porsche,cayenne,2005,Maria, 02/20/2006,The best of the SUV's,5,"I thought that the Porsche Cayenne was the last SUV I'd ever consider buying, but after a test drive, I was sold. It's sexy, stylish, turns great, and has outstanding breaks.  Plus, it is safer than other SUV's. this truck is excellence at its best. "
porsche,cayenne,2005,M, 04/16/2006,2005 Porsche Cayenne,4,"The Porsche Cayenne is the best of all the SUVs.  It has decent off road performance combined with smooth on road performance.  If you will do most of your driving on road, get performance tires (not off road or M&S).  The ride will be much better, and the cornering performance is on par with many sport sedans."
porsche,cayenne,2005,Sue Levine, 08/14/2006,Porshe Cayenne S,4,"I love the car but wish the cup holders were bigger. This seems like a petty complaint, but other designers manage to work it in. Also, I wish I did not have to ""pop"" the gasoline door. With 12,000 miles I still have not had an oil change although I've tried to schedule it twice. I was told both times to wait until I get closer to 20,000 miles."
porsche,cayenne,2005,jm, 09/25/2006,2005 Cayenne,4,"The Cayenne's V6 engine lacks some pickup, but that's not why I bought it.  It is roomy and looks good."
porsche,cayenne,2005,Marginal-VFR, 12/24/2006,Porsche Cayenne - Fun to Drive!,4,"My 1995 Porsche Cayenne has excellent quality throughout.  It is fun to drive, but go easy on the gas pedal - this thing drinks like a fish!  If you can set the 16 MPG aside, you will fall in love with the Porsche Cayenne."
porsche,cayenne,2005,SMURNIN, 01/27/2007,Love This Vehicle!,4,This is the best car I have ever owned in my life for the purpose that I use it for. It is an SUV and it still offers all of the features of Porsche!
porsche,cayenne,2005,allen, 03/17/2007,Great Vehicle,4,This is a really fun vehicle to drive.  It is solid and reliable to own.  My dealer and Porsche have been very responsive to any problems.  It eats gas except for at highway speeds though.
porsche,cayenne,2005,Brit, 09/04/2007,"Amazing value, amazing car",5,This is my first Porsche. I bought a 2 year old Turbo for about half the new price. All I can say is that it has been fantastic and the higher running costs should be more than offset by the fact that it has taken most of its depreciation!
porsche,cayenne,2006,Terry frranke, 07/09/2016,Best car I have ever owned,5,"Still great car after almost 11 years. Still looks great - classic. 125,000 miles and close to zero maintenance issues.

porsche,cayenne,2006,Jennifer Lawson Perez, 10/17/2015,My Little Euro Head Turner,5,"We love ours.  It runs like a champ and has that sophisticated look that one comes to expect from Porsche.   We especially love how quiet it runs and the steering.  We had a BMW X5 before, but this SUV is much more elegant, comfortable, stable and attractive.

Asked to update this review 4/21/2016...Still love this car!
"
porsche,cayenne,2006,smcayenne, 05/14/2011,Cayenne Rocks!,4,"I bought my 2006 CPO in 2010 and love it.
It has been incredibly reliable and it drives like a sports sedan.
It is the perfect size-plenty of room but I don't feel like I'm driving a bus.
It is incredibly responsive, great acceleration and power and true 4wd."
porsche,cayenne,2006,Steve B, 11/27/2017,A White Elephant,2,"Yes, the Cayenne S has performance, it is downhill from there. I have had the car for 14 years, currently at 165 K miles. But the repairs and regular upkeep drives me nuts. You need a new set of tires every 15,000 miles ($1500). You need new brakes every 25,000 miles ($2500), replacing the battery will cost you $1000 because the stupid battery is located under the driver seat. Here is a partial list of things that went wrong - power steering fluid leaked (bad seal), turn light bulbs in the headlight assembly would blow up every 5,000 miles - stopped replacing . The fancy terrain following headlamps don't work too well, power train shaft had to be replaced, engine vacuum problem, all eight ignition coils had to be replaced ($800), gas tank fuel pump plastic flanges cracked ($1500), even the washer fluid container cracked. I had to sue Porsche in small claims court to get them pay for the fuel pump replacement ( a recall item). If you have cash to burn , go ahead buy a Porsche - otherwise stay away.

porsche,cayenne,2006,NABMAN, 07/07/2008,Fix the tranny,4,"The Cayenne is great.  High performance, fast, corners well, luxurious and well built.  Excellent performance on the highway but this vehicle has one major problem- the tranny.  In the city, it is not nimble enough to weave in and out of traffic.  It is hard to control.  Too fast or your punching it to switch gears. The acceleration is inconsistent. (I understand they changed this in the 08) The tranny takes forever to decide which gear it should go into and this creates lag.  If you are accustomed to high performance cars in the city, you will feel this. Likely to save gas, the tranny shifts up too quickly and down late in normal slow city driving. I have had this reset and am told thats it"
porsche,cayenne,2006,sonogun, 04/18/2014,second time around,4,"This 2006 replaced my 2004 turbo.
Strangely, it is not as peppy in that the tranny does not adapt quickly enough for your spirited driving mood. This prompted me to put it on an all wheel Dino and it is putting out on the first pull but suffers from heat sink on the second and third pull. My 2004 lost the heating pipes and the Cardon shaft along the way to 100,000 miles where it loss the fuel pumps. During that span I did two brake jobs, replacing rotors both times. My 2006 six had 60,000 when I bought it and after 20.000, I have had zero repair cost."
porsche,cayenne,2006,NurburgDriver, 01/29/2007,A Great SUV,4,"I read some of the negative reviews about the Cayenne and had to respond with some qualifiers. This is the best ""handling"" SUV you can buy. It handles corners and drives better than any other SUV however, if you are expecting superior acceleration then please don't buy a 6 cylinder. If you buy an SUV and expect acceleration from a 6 cylinder you need to study up on ""power to weight ratio"". Get this truck if you want an SUV that handles and drives beautifully. Do not get this truck if you think it's a Porsche which you can take on the track. I think Porsche did a fantastic job.  If you are looking for an SUV that handles great and drives very well, look no further."
porsche,cayenne,2006,John, 05/25/2007,Best SUV,4,"I have to say this is the best SUV on the market, hands down.  Ride comfort, true utility and of course the Porsche acceleration and tuned exhaust make driving the Cayenne S a must.  Ergonomics are perfect, even for a guy my size (6'3"" and 375#).  Turning radius is much better than expected.  It's takes a bit of getting used to the transmission which solidly downshifts, keeping you always in an optimum engine torque range.  Very tight in corners. Options and controls are intuitive, no problem getting to know the bells and whistles without reading the owner's manual (the manly thing).  Interior lighting at night is exceptionally well engineered."
porsche,cayenne,2006,kb, 06/15/2006,Porsche has paint issues!,3,"I just purchased my first Porsche.  I traded a beatiful Lexus GX470 that I wish I had back.  Although the Porsche is fun to drive and I like the look, I have had several issues with the flat black paint.  You can breathe on the paint and it scratches.  It is only two months old and looks worse than most cars that are years old.  The dealership has tried to put a band- aide on it and they keep cleaning it up really pretty.  I am afraid to see what this car looks like in 6 months to a year.  I cannot believe that a company like Porsche would offer such a poor quality paint!  This should not even be an option!"
porsche,cayenne,2006,Greg Lewis, 12/19/2007,The Beast,4,"A great vehicle for those who really want ""sport"" in their SUV. Strong, powerful & fast, the Cayenne S combines good steering feedback with excellent (sometimes squeaky) brakes. At 5300 lbs having all these benefits is fairly amazing. The ride is stiff, but that is a trade-off for exceptional cornering. The tiptronic is the best auto-manual tranny I have used. I really enjoy making the gear changes myself. If you want the best acceleration out of this car, changing manually is a must. I have already added precat bypass pipes, giving 17hp over stock. I am also eyeing a computer remap and perhaps a free-flow intake for another 30-HP. I've owned 1988 and 1999 Carreras. Cayenne is a true Porsche."
porsche,cayenne,2006,Papparaz, 08/22/2010,A pleasure to drive (6 Cyl),4,I test drove a 4Runner and an MDX. The Cayenne was just too fun to pass up. I bought used from a dealer who provided additional 2 years CPO warranty. The tiptronic in manual mode gives adequate pep but my wife's Avalon is still faster 0-60. Passes well on the highway. Exhaust note is a nice touch -  except when listening to music. No tow bar installed yet but it is planned so hope there is enough power. The park assist option is both handy and annoying but it can be turned off by pushing a button. Everyone seems to agree the cup holders are too small. Can idle rough after cold start if fuel < 93 octane. Overall I just love driving this vehicle and have had no problems after 3 months.
porsche,cayenne,2006,Harry, 09/08/2006,Very Fun Car,4,"I replaced my BMW 2003 X5 with a Porsche Cayenne S.  The power and handling are incredible.  The Tiptronic shifter is similar to BMW's.  I also have it on the steering wheel, which is very handy for fast acceleration or passing.  The Cayenne handles better than the Sport Edition of the BMW X5 3.0 model that I had.  It is better on the bumps in the road.  Its cornering is better too.  The sound of the engine is what is incredible about the Cayenne.  It has that great Porsche sound.  It is a good SUV for the family.  There are some features I wished the Cayenne had that the BMW has, but in terms of handling and comfort of drive - I'll take the Cayenne S over the BMW X5 Sport Edition any day.  It will be interesting what the NEW BMW X5 is like.  Drive both before you buy."
porsche,cayenne,2006,Zachariah A., 12/27/2016,Life is too short to drive uninspiring vehicles!,5,"At age 52 - I am thrilled to buy this Porsche SUV. After years of owning cars for the sake of saving money - I decided to change things up, at this juncture in life.  As a result, this go-anywhere, do-it-all, rocket-sled brick has unleashed hidden Adrenaline I have pent-up inside, for decades. Every drive now brings a huge, LOL smile to my face. Suddenly, spending money on something THIS FUN is now totally worth it. I plan on driving this over-the-top beast to the ground. I can now leave this Earth knowing I drove the fastest, man-made, land object I could afford. My perspective on life is now enhanced. Read all the reviews, watch all the YouTube video on this remarkable machine. There truly is NO substitute...

porsche,cayenne,2006,Gene Bussian, 09/07/2005,My 11th Porsche,4,"In 1955 I purchased my first Porsche. I have had a 356s, a912, a 911 Targa and two RS Spyders.   I raced them all.  Comparing an SUV with these sports cars might seem hard, but the Cayenne S is really a Porsche at heart.  It can corner and brake with ease.   The ride has three adjustments with my air suspension.  It is the finest automobuile I have ever owned or driven. There is no spare tire...but then could I really change 20"" wheels by myself?    "
porsche,cayenne,2006,Eric Berlin , 03/05/2020,I absolutely love this car - now at 250K miles!,5,"I didn't intend to buy a fancy SUV but I stumbled onto this in May 2016. I was looking for a something capable for off road for my summers in Colorado. As soon as I sat in it, I knew I would drive it home. I purchased it for $13,500 with 113K miles. I stopped by the European car guy in my town and had him look it over. It was in great shape needing nothing at the time. He did warn me about the plastic engine cooling pipes that would eventually go as well as the driveshaft mount. These are well documented issues with good solutions. With good maintenance, this car has been relatively trouble free ever since. Those two issues did come up. When changing the coolant pipes, we did the water pump and alternator. I also had a wheel bearing go and the transfer case for the 4WD. We also replaced the battery at around 150K. Nothing else mechanical. 

I am on the original suspension and exhaust. The suspension still feels the same as the day I bought it. The engine still purrs its throaty growl like new also. Amazingly well-built machine. 

The interior has held up well under heavy use with a dog and child in the outdoors. The rear hatch struts also go and did on mine and needed to be replaced. The exterior has held up very well and still doesn't look dated for a 15 year old car. I have a car wash pass that allows me to wash it daily if need be, so the New England road salt hasn't affected it. I have a few small chips to paint once the weather is warmer, but without anything more than regular washing the paint looks awesome. 

I picked up a spare set of rims at tire rack for snow tires and have had great success in the New England winters with them. Summers I spend in Colorado and have navigated serious jeep roads to high peak trailheads to hike 14ers. The only time I got stuck was in Great Sand Dunes National Park where we just didn't have enough ground clearance for the sand. I got through the same road several times the previous year, but last time we just slid into the tire ruts and bottomed out. 

It is a serious towing machine as well. It has tons of towing capability. I have towed large UHaul trailers without feeling a thing. Lots of folks use their Cayenne to tow their race cars to the track. 

The only nagging issue I have with the car is the stereo. I am a musician and have always swapped out head units when buying older cars and intended to do the same here. Unfortunately, since the wiring of the car is fiberoptic, there are no real solutions short of a complete rewiring of the car which would have cost $2-3K. I ordered some gadget I found at Crutchfield and it cost me tons twice what I paid for it for two Porsche specialized mechanics (one an audio specialist who SWORE he could make it work) to try and make it work. The best we could get it to do was get a single channel when streaming on the rare occasion we got anything to connect. Never got the phone to work. So, I use a Bluetooth headset for phone and when I want to stream music, I use an FM modulator with adequate results. When playing CDs or the XM radio, the sound is absolutely fantastic. I only wish I could use the steering wheel controls for phone. Finally, there is a lose connection for my GPS receiver, so the in dash nav no longer works, but I use my phone anyway. Oh yeah, the navigation system is a DVD player under the passenger seat and is very dated. You can get a somewhat updated disc, but I recommend simply using WAZE on your phone. 


Gas mileage with premium gas is expensive, but you do get acceleration 0-60 in 6 seconds with an SUV and it is incredibly fun to drive. I consistently get 16-17 mpg and sometimes a little better on my yearly trips across the country. I drive it a lot, two months shy of 4 years since buying it, I am about to flip 250K in the next day or two. That is 137K since I bought it. Pretty amazing 4 years with it. Would be happy to do it
 again.

porsche,cayenne,2006,Mark, 10/11/2005,Best SUV for Car Enthusiasts,4,"The Porsche Cayenne V6 gets a bad rap in the motoring press because at ""only"" 247hp and 229 lb. torque, there is not much power to move around 4,800 lbs. of SUV.  If you know how to drive a sports car, and like to shift gears, however, I have found the V6 to be plenty of power for American roads.  Keep the revs above 2,500 and save more than $15,000 over the S model and get an extra 2 mpg over V8 version.  The suspension is pure Porsche.  I replaced a BMW X5 3.0 with my Cayenne which is at about the same price point.  I find the Porsche to be: more comfortable, better handling, a little more spacious, better offroad, and way more fun to drive.  It is solid as a rock, too, and feels overengineered - 7,700 lb. towing capacity speaks for itself."
porsche,cayenne,2006,John, 04/03/2006,Not a good Porsche model,3,The car runs hit and miss (stalls).  Its steering and overall performance are not up to Porsche standards. The radio is cheap (speakers are fine) and finding a well trained service dept. is a challenge. After communicating my concerns with the Porsche people in the corporate NA Headquarters in GA as well as the dealer and service personel I would not recomend this car. I have owned two Porsches before but it seems the company has changed in both quality and service.

It drives like a sports car, it can beat most of them out there, comfort for 5. When you're driving up the mountain for some R&R at the lake, there is no better car to get that fun drive and bring along your family and gear! Name one other besides a Maserati 4 door? Porsche is known to be one of the only reliable sport cars, think Lambo, Ferrari, Aston Martin, would you buy any of them with over 80,000 mile on them? Porsche sells with no issues with high mileage for a reason! This is the top pick when buying the SUV of your dreams!"
porsche,cayenne,2006,Ryan Deredin, 04/16/2006,Cayenne,5,I love the Cayenne's crisp handling and exterior styling. The flexibility of the interior and the supple leather and everything is just such a great combination. It really helps to get to work in the morning when I'm in a rush. Excellent job Porsche.

As an owner of a 911 Cab and a 356 SC Sunroof Coupe, it only seemed appropriate to get a Cayenne as the household SUV.  I strongly considered the Range Rover Sport as it is stunning, I just could not get past the truck like performance and handling.  The Cayenne on the other hand is all Porsche.  Nimble, quick and just plain fun to drive.  Incredibly comfortable and aggressive looks with the titanium package.  Love the features though the navigation and radio are not intuitive.  Also, Porsche needs to package options as there are so many that it can be confusing.  No excuse for not having mp3 aux jack as standard.  Options are very robustly priced. Get one!"
porsche,cayenne,2006,tye, 07/08/2006,Customer Service is not top priority,3,I too have had many paint issues with my Porsche Cayenne.  The paint is way too soft.  I have had the paint looked at by three professional painters and all three agree that it is a poor paint job.  I have vioced my concerns to Porsche Customer Care and all they could do was have a representative call me that wanted to blaim me for the damage.  I tried to call them back and they told me there was no one else to speak too.  The flat paint line should be removed as an option.  I have spoken to other Cayenne owners and the ones that have the metallic paint are fine.  All flat colors have issues.  I sympathize with the other owner I sure know what you are going through.
porsche,cayenne,2006,kinta, 11/06/2006,Class In Itself,3,"The Porsche Cayenne turbo is a great SUV.  It gets the looks and questions like any other Porsche.  Off roading isn't its best feature though.  I prefer the Range Rover over this truck and that is why I traded it in.  The Cayenne had a lot of oversteer in icy conditions.  The Ranger Rover isn't as fast with the super charger, but it uses the same amount of gas and is actually more comfortable.  The head room is also better in the Range Rover, but build quality is better in the Cayenne Turbo.  The AWD is OK in the Cayenne, but it's same as Audi's.  If standing out is your game and speed is the key, get a Cayenne, but for practicality and pure off road use go for the Range Rover."
porsche,cayenne,2006,Cayenne06 , 06/02/2008,Cayenne Titanium Black,4,Very satisfied so far with the Cayenne. Titanium edition features second to none (for the price).
porsche,cayenne,2006,Martin Santos, 01/10/2007,SUV Sports Car,4,"This is a sports car in an SUV's body.  It is a pleasure to drive. You'll never know how fast you're going until the car behind you is flashing his red lights. The quality is typical for a Porsche. I test drove all of the new SUVs, including the 2007 BMW X5 and nothing comes close. If you're looking for a strictly utilitarian vehicle there are others that are far cheaper, but you can't beat this as far as driving pleasure and fun."

I test drove the new Mercedes-Benz ML500 and handed the keys back to the sales guys and drove down the street and bought the Cayenne S that afternoon."
porsche,cayenne,2006,matt rinard, 10/10/2005,Excellent SUV,4,"This is my second Porsche Cayenne S. The Germans fixed few items since the 2003 model, such as improving the horrible keyless entry.  The new one is great.  The seats are a total pain in the rear to fold down, you have to take off the head rest and move the front seat forward. It only takes about three minutes but it seems like forever. The build quality is great. The handling is the best out there.  The downfall is it's closest competitor is the BMW free service for 3 years.  The Porsche people stick it to you for the oil change...over $200 and you have to leave your car. So buy the paper filter for $15 at Porsche and go to Speedy Oil and it is only $80 but done in 15 minutes. Great car if you don't mind spending the money."
porsche,cayenne,2006,randy, 07/31/2006,Cayenne S Excellent Family / Sports SUV,4,"I bought a Porsche Cayenne about three weeks ago and simply love it. It has great handling as well as a sports car feel. It is not the best on gas, but what V8 is these days. Unless you get lost often, the navigation system is about $2,000+ and not a lot of fun after the first week. The moonroof is nice at night. This truck provides overall great performance and it is practical as well."
porsche,cayenne,2006,MYCAY, 09/27/2009,"Very good, but had too high expectations",4,"I agree with the previous posts about light bulbs and transmission, and would add that the V6 is terribly underpowered esp. for the fuel economy.   I just had one blinker bulb changed at the dealer at a cost of $80.  It's not something I want to play around with myself in this car... the entire headlight assembly has to be removed to change any bulb.  The engine is sadly underpowered but the transmission itself is enough to almost ruin the driving experience.  I completely agree with the other reviewer who said this Japanese-made tranny does not do the job.  I often wonder how Porsche engineers ever thought this engine/tranny combo was worthy of the Porsche badge because, in my opinion, it's not."

I had a Toyota 4Runner that had better performance, acceleration, power, and gas millage than this piece of crap! Let me tell you. before this, I had the Cayenne S, and that's a completely different car than the 6-cylinder! This car has absolutely no juice! It is supposed to have 240 HP, but the acceleration and the power as worse than a 4-cylinder Ford Ranger truck!  And the gas millage is about 12.8 mpg on average!  Do not buy or lease this vehicle!  Pay a little more, and get the Cayenne S.  I am returning mine back to the dealer at whatever cost!  I can;t stand it, for shame Porsche!"
porsche,cayenne,2006,scott, 01/24/2008,Not worth the money,3,"The Cayenne is a very heavy sports car to put it kindly.  It's not for the daily commute unless you enjoy being bounced around like a basketball.  Gas mileage is 11mpg around town with premium.  The suspension is so stiff my wife's afraid to drink her coffee on our commute.  We have a 4runner that can easily hold it's own with the Cayenne performance wise.  My Tundra can easily keep up in a straight line.  I know because I have ""raced"" my buddy while he drives the vehicles listed above.  It currently has 17k miles and already has a tail light out.  I also don't like the baby cupholders.  For 70k get something with comfort and performance...it's not the Cayenne."
porsche,cayenne,2006,bill sun, 11/03/2006,"High Performance, Low Quality",4,"I bought my Cayenne six months ago. It's fun to drive and I really enjoyed it until I had to send it back to the dealership for repair recently.  I test-drove BMW X5 V8, Range Rover, Lexus GS470, Acura MDX and Volvo XC90 V8 before I bought the Cayenne S, which gave me the best road experience among all. The only one I didn't test was Mercedes GL450.  The reliability was fair, or even poor. The plastic trim beneath the rear door broke in two month and I had to get it repaired at the dealership. The cup holder was broken two month later. One day I found the control panel was not working, and the the 4 wheel drive was not functioning. I scheduled a service appointment on the next day, but my Cayenne wouldn't start.  Before I could drop the car at the dealership. Porsche sent a service guy help me to jump start my vehicle. Now the car is in the autoshop. I guess it's a circuit and/or battery problem.  "
porsche,cayenne,2006,Steve, 05/29/2008,Not for the Timid,4,"The car is very fun to drive and handles both city and highway very well. Comfortable, it's not. The car is very stiff as are the seats, and the steering is heavy. I have had a dipped beam problem that does not seem to go away, and I have had it serviced for that twice. I have also had to replace the rear cup holders twice which inexplicably jammed in the console. If you are thinking of the 6 cylinder, then buy an Acura. Porsches are meant to have 8 cylinders. It costs me about $80 to fill the tank these days, so fuel efficient it is definitely NOT. "

Its handling, acceleration, and exhaust note are fantastic!  While it's not as lithe as the Boxster I traded in on it, the 50/50 weight distribution and 62/38 rear wheel power bias of the AWD system give it a real sport sedan feel.

It is a bit bouncey but its a 450 hp SUV! "
porsche,cayenne,2006,Scott, 11/25/2006,Do Not Buy this Car!,1,"I just bought the Cayenne 6-cylinder. It is definitely the worst luxury vehicle money can buy! You hardly have any acceleration in this truck! And you would think you would save on gas!  NOOOOOOO!  I get about 13.2 miles per gallon on both street and freeway!  The Bose sound system sounds terrible and the navigation is a pain in the rear to work with! I paid top dollar for this vehicle and I am very disappointed! I can't return it either! So I am stuck with a slow, low performing truck for 3.5 years!"

porsche,cayenne,2006,Racer, 12/12/2006,Just for Looks!,1,"I bought my 6-cylinder Cayenne almost a year ago. I have owned Porsches in the past, but I must say THIS IS THE WORST MODEL Porsche has ever made! The fuel economy is absolutely not acceptable. I get about 12 miles per gallon! You would expect more acceleration and power with that kind of fuel consumption, but the vehicle shows very little power and acceleration! There's a dead delay after you floor the gas pedal, and the transmission takes a long time to decide which gear to choose! I am very disappointed at this model! "
porsche,cayenne,2006,Rich, 08/20/2005,What a fun Porsche,4,"This is a great vehicle. It goes through snow and mud as easily as an asphalt parking lot. It looks pretty good, a little fat. To me, this is not a gussied up VW Touareg, nor is the VW a downmarket Porsche. The Cayenne S is the best balance of the 3. The Turbo is just unbelivably fast, but the suspension seems to have a difficult time handling all that power; even feeling a little torque steer. The V6 is just that, a V6. Go for the S. It is plenty fast for US market, and affordable when you run the numbers on a lease. Porsches hold their value, and this is a better deal than many other SUVs in this price bracket. If you know how to amortize the payments, this is the way to go."

porsche,cayenne,2006,Marc, 12/05/2005,Love It!,4,"Car is extremely well put together and fun to drive, vehicle gets expensive with ala carte options that are standard with the competition.   Only annoyance is that when you need to park it for an extended period the battery will drain down, there is no ""long term stand bye mode"".  Total plus of this design is the navigation, you can disable it and drive fr weeks without seeing an annoying navigation warning.  Nice job Porsche! "
porsche,cayenne,2006,Sam, 03/18/2006,Better than my X5,4,"My Porsche Cayenne rides very well.  It has just enough power, but could use a little boost.  It handles better than my last vehicle (a 2003 X5) and stops better too.  This SUV looks great, and its paint job is much better than the one on my X5 too.  Its sound system isn't great, I should have gotten the upgraded Bose.   It leases for almost exactly what the X5 loaded does.  It is a nice change.   "
porsche,cayenne,2006,JGW, 07/31/2006,Very Solid SUV,4,"The car is built very well.  I know that the sister car, the Touareg is a lemon.  The Cayenne is not.  I really enjoy the interior.  The navigation system is very nice and easy to use.  The standard stereo has a very high quality of sound. The seats are comfortable.  It is very fast and when you use the triptonic.  I love the sound.  It is sooo beefy!  That V8 hollers!  I had one minor problem with it right when I got it.  The antifreeze was leaking into the AC. But the dealer fixed it right away.  I really love the car."

It has been the best vehicle I have ever owned.  I have had to change the headlights a few times, nothing anyone with a little common sense couldn't do themselves.  I have three young children but wasn't ready to give up my need for performance!  Handles awesomely, acceleration is amazing.  I am in the market for another Porsche, although I don't like the new rear end on the Cayenne's I love the Panamara!!  "
porsche,cayenne,2006,frank, 06/19/2006,What a Fun Vehicle to Own,4,"This is the best SUV I have ever owned.  After having driven a Jeep, a Mercedes and a Range Rover, I'm totally sold to Porsche. At any speed on any road you have full control. The only minor negative point is the price for the options."
porsche,cayenne,2006,Asif Matin, 01/19/2007,Best SUV on the Market,5,"This is the best SUV in this class. Every dollar is worth it. Before I bought this, I drove a BMW X5 and a Mercedes ML 350.  They do not compare to the Cayenne. Its gas mileage is excellent. This is the best SUV you can get."
porsche,cayenne,2006,Karina, 08/22/2007,Not Mom friendly,4,"I really don't like this car.  When we went to look at it I thought it was great because it had style, class and super comfortable seats.  The more I drive it though, the less I enjoy it.  The GPS system is terrible.  The seats are nearly impossible for me to maneuver (can't get the head-rests on and off by myself, really hard to fold and lift the rear seats) and the rear storage is totally inadequate.  I had my daughter a year after I bought this car and it is so difficult to put the car seat in and out of too!  On the other hand, we were rear eneded when she was a newborn and barely felt the impact which was nice.  "
porsche,cayenne,2006,Stormy, 10/30/2018,The Best SUV for the Money!,5,"The biggest thing to owning a used Porsche, either be a mechanic so you can perform your own repairs, or find a good non-dealer shop to perform your maintenance. Also, knowing where to buy parts (other than from a dealer) is also a big plus. Two good ones are Pelican and ECS Tuning. Another reviewer stated headlight bulbs couldn't be changed, this is untrue for all headlight types and the dealer stuck it to him. Even xenon bulbs in top of the line models can be replaced. For power, few cars available even today can compare to a 2006 Cayenne Turbo S. You can tow with the best of them and the adjustable suspension is great. The interior is a great place to be and surrounds you in comfort. The only things lacking are current tech thought these did have the 30pin ipod adapters that you can now buy adapters for android and iPhone for.  You can also buy a new entertainment head unit (around $750) that corrects most tech deficiencies. The onluy thing i miss in my TTS after driving newer vehicls is adaptive cruise control but every time i drive it, it puts a smile on my face anyway.

porsche,cayenne,2006,phil, 08/26/2005,Porsche Cayenne: Best SUV,4,"The Porshe Cayenne is by far the best SUV made on this planet. Not only is the SUV fun to drive but it is also a very safe car. The four wheel drive is AWESOME. My family and I were driving to the airport in HEAVY SNOW. WE went in our Range Rover and I was driving but it was nearly impossible to stay on the road it was the worst snow storm i have ever been in. So, I turned around to go back home, and we switched to the Cayenne......when i got back on the road with it i was able to pass people go in the upper 80's without any trouble.(no joke)Now moving on to the fun part of driving it. This SUV is VERY FAST AND GREAT HANDLING GREAT BREAKS 0-62 in 5.2 sec. And i have had no problems."
porsche,cayenne,2006,Mark, 03/07/2006,Love the Cayenne S,4,"Have had my Cayenne S for five months and love it.  The S model is incredible to drive, I can't imagine having a turbo.  It is very smooth.  Its navigational system is excellent.  The only drawback I can find is the small cup holders on the interior."
porsche,cayenne,2006,Dan Kohn, 11/07/2005,I love my Cayenne,4,I've been driving my 2006 Porsche Cayenne for 6 months. It has never had any problems.  It has great pick up and is a joy to drive.  My last car was a Land Rover and nothing inside made sense.  The entire cabin of my Cayenne was designed with comfort and ease in mind.

porsche,cayenne,2008,el415, 01/05/2011,More than I expected in a SUV,5,"You wonder how they do it, other than you being high off of the ground you hardly notice the weight and size of this car.
No it doesn't have Porsche speed, but it's plenty quick for any base luxury SUV. I had a Discovery 2 and a 540i. It really drives a like the 540i, but not as quick, it's very similar to a 528i or an Audi A6 3.0. As to the Disco, the Cayenne is far more nimbler and much more responsive. It's a European sports sedan that's tall, big, and can go off-road (if that's important to you, check out videos on Youtube)."
porsche,cayenne,2008,Pat Edwards, 01/03/2016,Better than I had anticipated Reliability,5,"Among the best SUV's I have ever owned. I am also a Porsche 911C4 owner and I am very impressed with how Porsche designed the Cayenne. However, I am disappointed that for a 2008 vehicle, the bluetooth function is not on par with a vehicle that costs much less. In fact, the bluetooth function is absent altogether, and interfacing mobile electronics or other devices is not possible without a significant aftermarket appliance cost. Additionally, the CD changer has known problems that are not able to be repaired inexpensively. If one can overlook these drawbacks, then the Porsche Cayenne remains a solid vehicle and extremely reliable.

Heavy and not so fast, but all Porsche. Stock, the suspension feels as refined as any SUV on the planet and better than most cars including my wife's Audi A4. Built like a rock solid as one too, comfortable, luxurious and a good compromise between speed and economy. We just traveled across country as a family (6,000 miles) and we all still love this car.

porsche,cayenne,2008,rincon6, 03/10/2007,"First Impression (1,000 miles)",5,"I love the '08s more aggressive look and the thing flies.  It now has more than enough power and its extremely versatile. On mellow trips I keep the sport function off, but hit the sport button and the transforms itself into a monster! Its handling is excellent, it has tight steering for an SUV and it is very responsive. I traded in a Range Rover and the difference in performance is night and day. In the Cayenne, I almost forget that Im in an SUV. Looking down the hood from the drivers seat it feels like driving a sports car, but visibility is better, and bumps, railroad tracks etcno problem. At $46,000, the base Tiptronic Cayenne is not only an awesome SUV, but one of the best values out there."
porsche,cayenne,2008,mike, 03/19/2009,Cayenne S,4,"Never owned an SUV. Test drove many (X5,Range Rover, ML 350, Tahoe, Lexus) including the Cayenne and Cayenne S. The Porsche outperformed them all. Once you drive the S, the power, the energy was incredible. The base Cayenne was a nice drive, however, if you have the extra $15K go for the S - you will not  be sorry. The S has incredible power and performance. Its like a jumbo jet racing down the runway, totally awesome.  Very comfortable, sporty and drives much nicer than my 2001 C320 Benz that I traded in. No comparison.  I highly recommend the Cayenne S."

porsche,cayenne,2008,Dr. Lawrence, 05/07/2019,Great Sporting SUV,5,"These cars may represent one of the best values on the used market.  Advanced technology in engine electronics, pneumatic suspension and one of the loveliest leather interiors ever made.  Having chain cam belts eliminates expensive maintenance for cam belts, proven and durable V-8 and adjustable suspension for ride height and comfort vs. sport settings make this  a very versatile vehicle, with hill hold assist etc.  Classic, conservative  styling over the years ensures brand recognition of this clean body style.  And, as all the magazines attest, it is the best driving full size SUV on the market.  It ocntinues to impress and always a pleasure to drive.

Performance, handling, feel, etc. right up there with what I expect from a Porsche.  More sporty than my Audi A6 2.7T.  Handling not what the Carrera offers, but a real joy on the corners.  Leather is great, PCM so-so, transmission is intuitive.   Better than most ""luxury sport sedans"" I have driven, plus the utility of an SUV.  We look forward to every trip, and expect to keep this puppy a long time.  Also, high WAF (wife approval factor) so it's not just a guy's car (remember to get the leather interior).  Dealer wanted to deal, so buy off the lot if you can, and bring a trade-in.  Love the green metallic paint, too!"
porsche,cayenne,2008,hellfire, 08/14/2008,love my gts red gts!,4,"Went from 911(997)cab + Range Rover Supercharged to the GTS.  Although interior appointments not as luxurious as the RR, it feels as expensive. Alcantara is lovely! Fat steering wheel the best I've held. Took it on rough roads for a hike and with comfort suspension mode + raised height, felt just slightly more bumpy than the RR, though definitely need to be careful with the 21 inch rims.  dealer added tooki bluetooth and ipod integration so gadget wise, slightly better than the RR.  skipped the rear view camera - view is straight down so not as much visibility as RRSC, but parking assist is just about as good.  in all, it's made me forget my RRSC, but i still miss the 911 a bit."
porsche,cayenne,2008,DH, 02/01/2019,"112,000 miles and still going Very Strong",5,"How does Porsche build an SUV that handles like a sportscar? It doesn't handle like my Alfa Romeo Giulia but in Sport mode, this beast of a car handles as well... perhaps better than the 2018 Alfa Romeo Stelvio that I recently drove for 2 days. Remembering that this is a 10 year old car, it's simply amazing. PROS: Sports car level of handling, sports car level of acceleration. Spacious. Very respectable off-road capability. CONS: The 4.8L V8 is very thirsty. Rough ride. Even for a 2008 car, the in-car technology like Bluetooth is lacking.

Acceleration and cornering performance are outstanding, and rival all but a handful of true sports cars. I wanted a 911 turbo, but live in the mountains and need a SUV. I don't feel I'm missing out on the driving experience at all. New front end is beautiful and aggressive. Highly recommend it."
porsche,cayenne,2008,jfcpamba, 11/16/2012,Great SUV with ONE major flaw...,4,"I bought a used Cayenned S with 50k miles on it.
It is a great vehicle as most of the reviewers have noted.
However, there is one major flaw which no one has pointed to in their reviews.
The front buckets seats are extremely uncomfortable, probably the worst I've ever sat on.
The middle section is only about 16"" wide and go up sharply from there to provide support, but it is extremely firm.
My bottom side and hamstrings are literally sore after driving for an extended period of time.
I am now driving with a pillow.
A quick note, I am averaging about 15 MPG in mixed driving and the vehilce is solid.
No other complaints other than those seats.
C'mon Porsche, you can do better!"
porsche,cayenne,2008,RCD, 03/02/2008,Obnoxious Performance,4,"The ""Oh my god I can't believe how fast and loud that gorgeous SUV is"" look I get from drivers when I roar past them, is alone worth the $130K I spent on this vehicle. It may not be as pretty as the Range Rover or as practical as the X5, but it is definitely the most fun to drive. I only wish they made a bigger gas tank because I'm constantly having to fill it up (approx. 10 mpg). I've previously owned a CLK Benz and an Audi Allroad, and they don't even compare to the '08 Cayenne Turbo in acceleration and handling. Even though the price is ridiculous, you only live once, and it would be a shame if I died and didn't get to experience the thrill of driving this once-in-a- lifetime vehicle."
porsche,cayenne,2008,gte864f, 07/15/2007,Porsche Cayenne!,4,"As a current owner, let me tell you what options you should pass on.  Skip the Cargo system and any type of upgraded wheels.  You will save a few dollars if the car comes with the Preferred Pkg or Preferred Pkg plus.  Its more if you select all the stuff that comes in these packages a stand-alone.  In the USA, the Cayenne will be more than enough power, especially in sports mode.  There is a slight delay in the acceleration when you press on the gas but once its in the optimum power band the acceleration is linear.  If you dont need a Nav and all the other options I would opt for the Cayenne S.  The difference is very noticeable.  Love the car and the Look.  Wood Package is a must have!"
porsche,cayenne,2008,DM, 09/07/2009,Good value,4,"I have been very pleased overall with this car.  Best handling SUV out there (after driving all of them).  Comfortable for me (I'm 6'5"") but not for anyone behind me.  Not a real good family car.  Just not enough room for any length of time with kids or stuff.  But the only Porsche you can take the family of 5 in.  Could use more power and the mileage is not great for a V6."

No truck on the market seemed ""just right"" and so my search turned to SUVs.  On a whim I stopped at the porsche dealership and drove one.  I bought it the next day.  No other car has ever been such a pleasure to drive.  Everything about it is superb.  Handles like a dream.  Accelerates like a sports car.  Lots of room.  Turns heads.  Comfortable.

From that time on, the car is running great. I have now 47K miles on it. During this time I did change the front and rear brake pads and front disk brakes, went through few sets of tires, oil changes every year and all the maintenance at Porsche dealer.

Turns out that it is normal on the 2008 but not on previous models and is caused by the fuel pump.  I had to have two areas of horrible paint runs wet sanded off of the back of the car.  Also, had to have the entire roof wet sanded due to flaws left in the clear coat by the protective wrap. I get a great deal of road noise and in cabin noise caused by creaking back seats and various rattles.  Excessive air noise coming in front passenger window as well.

But then my dealer did not want to give me a loaner, saying they are all reserved for customers coming for an oil change. I was stuck early in the morning had to pick up my son from school, go see customers and fly overseas that day. I had to rent a car to continue my day. Then i had to replace my oxygen sensor.

Well I just switched from 04 Cayenne S which I loved to new 2008 model and I have to disagree. Front of new S has been redesigned to give slicker lines, more aggressive looking grilles and there is an unknown something but when my wife and kids saw it (in same color) they all said it looked much sportier. The extra power in the new S (extra 45hp) makes a big difference. If you want you can drive in sports mode (change gears at 6k) and acceleration and smoothness of change is noticable. New nav system is much better than the old. What can I say, I think new model is big upgrade on old and worth looking at."
porsche,cayenne,2008,PIOTRUS, 03/23/2008,Cayenne GTS - An Absolute Gem,5,"Ordered gts in nov 07, got it in March. Absolutely phenomenal car! Base Price $72k, beware options are numerous, expensive, and can easily add at least $15k to the Price. No bluetooth, but thats not a problem, next week I Will have tooki bluetooth system installed (3rd party), it works seamlessly with the existing nav. Better solution that Porsches phone module where you would have to insert your sim card into nav to use a phone. With the sport option enabled the cars engine has deep, loud roar. A truly unique Porsche sound. I get 13 city, 17 highway, something I expected, especially for a 405 hp engine. Had bmw x5 4.4 for many years, this Cayenne simply blows it away in every way."
porsche,cayenne,2008,Mark, 05/28/2008,Great Car,4,"So far so good.  Drove the range rover sport, BMW X5, X6, Audi.  Looked around a good bit before settling on the Porsche Cayenne.  Decided to get the V6 over the V8 due to gas mileage.  Less power for sure but I would rather save money on gas vs. drag racing from stop lights.  The car drives very well you find it hard to believe you are sitting in a SUV vs. a 911.  Very sporty feel and drive.  The V6 has good acceleration especially when the sport mode is engaged.  Overall impressive car.  Porsche there is no substitute"
porsche,cayenne,2008,Donna Z, 01/17/2009,"Wish Porsche Got it Right, Rev. Blindly",3,"Although my Cayenne is sporty and zippy when necessary, Porsche has got some configuring to do.   For starters, it is SMALL!!! Be prepared if you have kids, this is not the truck for you.  There is little space to bring a SINGLE stroller along let alone anything else, groceries are impossible.  The truck is a bit of a dog!  Yes, you can pretend to drive it in manual but the fact is the truck doesn't have the sack you'd think it would have by its appearance... very disappointing!!!  Lastly, but most importantly, reversing, this SUV is a nightmare.  Visibility  is nil... like reversing blind folded !  If you've got a car seat directly behind the driver's side, forget visibility altogether."

porsche,cayenne,2008,Early Man Fan, 08/12/2007,Hard to believe it is a Porsche,3,"I have owned this since March of 2007.  It has been back to the dealer 3 times already and I still have issues with it.  Initially there were very bad paint runs on both side of the license plate.  These had to be wet sanded off.  There is a puttering sound that comes from the rear passenger area.  According to dealer and Porsche this is normal and will be found on all 2008 models.  It is something to do with the fuel pump.  Returned to dealer again when I discovered that the entire hood was covered with ""splotches"" under the clear coat.  Again, wet sanding was done on a brand new car.  Definitely should have purchased S model.  Acceleration is poor and seems to shift gears sluggish,"

This is not true.  I find the 4 wheel drive system to be lacking in Cayenne.  The shifting is jerky and there is a big delay when starting from a standstill.  The system should also be shift on the fly.  You can lock the diffentials when moving, up to a certain speed but the car must be in neutral.  The 4 wheel drive system in my 1999 jeep wrangler is far superior.  My thought is this is basically a sports car with all wheel drive.  It handles great and rides well.  However, if you want to go off road you are better off with a jeep.  Fit and finish on mine are excellent. "

porsche,cayenne,2008,dj, 05/24/2008,Great Handling Ride,4,"I got my Cayenne base tip with Nav, Bose, Auto Climate, Park Assist, among other options.  The climate control is a bit inflexible, but one can learn to modify setting to allow it to be shut off for heating and AC,  The park assist sensors for the front are too sensitive or erratic.  The Bose speakers are great and a must-have since the standard system is awful.  The overall ride is wonderful in handling and braking.  We are getting 18-19 mpg for overall driving with about 40% highway. On a recent road trip between northern and southern California Driving 75-80 mph on the highway, we got 20.5mpg.  Our car is white and the Cayenne plaque was black and looked cheap so we removed it."

For all of us who enjoy driving sports cars and also like to go out with the family, a 911 is no option; this GTS model drives like a true Porsche, not like the other versions of the Cayenne that drive like a SUV built by Porsche. Handling, handling, handling, the Turbo is very fast but falls short in crisp maneuvering. For me the GTS is the perfect balance, it has enough HP (405) and scalpel sharp handling. I got it in GTS Red color, every time I stop at a traffic light, people keep nodding in approval, and giving thumbs up.    "

It's a solid sports car for taking the whole family for a ride (100 mph feels like 60 mph). I can not imagine the turbo version or the GTS performance since I drive  the base entry level and love it!

I'm 6'4"", and have ample room in the front and rear seats. The cargo capacity in the rear is compromised, however (i.e, very small for an SUV). The ride is really good, even with 21"" wheels, even in San Francisco. Sports-mode transforms the vehicle. Handling is ungodly, with cornering speeds being higher than my 2007 Cayman. PDCC is a must, though I would pass on the variable steering, as it is very artificial and ""weird"" in 20- 50mph city driving."

We highly considered both the new GX460 and the BMW X-6, but went with the Cayenne after falling in love with it during a test drive.  Power is much superior to the Lexus and similar to the V-8 BMW in my opinion.  I would love to have the turbo edition, but hard to justify the price.  We love the ability to switch between the sport and comfort setting.  The cayenne GTS actually rides very smoothly in comfort mode.  Much smoother than I anticipated.     The navigation system with voice control is much improved over my LX470 or our 2008 CLK 550 Mercedes.  The I-pod interface is also fantastic in its controlability.  Great car."

Driving is exactly what you would expect from a Porsche SUV - exciting and fun (not a soft ride, its a sports SUV). Behind the wheel is FUN and EXCITING - the car responds so well anywhere and it sounds like a powerful car should. Utilitarian also: it has lots of room in the rear end for gold clubs and much more. 4 People ride ok, no more! The large Porsche wheels stand out so nice in their design. Unfortunately, like German lux cars, they need to be cleaned regularly - they get black brake dust on them way too fast. Expect about 14 MPG (if you drive regular + some fun driving). "
porsche,cayenne,2010,Steve B, 08/14/2018,Purchased my 2010 Transsyberia Pre-owned,5,"I purchased this pre-owned and have loved this car from day one.  I'm not a huge fan of the orange wheels or sticker, but lucky for me those wheels and stickers were long gone when I got the car last year.  I had it checked out prior by Porsche service and their comment was that the mechanics of the car were spot on.  The odometer had just tripped 150k and this thing drives like new.  Sport mode is so much fun and sounds great.  This car gets a lot of compliments and I've enjoyed every minute with it.  The interior with the Alcantara is sporty but luxurious.  Passengers say it is very comfortable, in the back as well.  The interior is tastefully accented with the orange on the dials, floormat trim, door trim, and seatbelts.  My personal favorite is the panoramic roof and shade.  The interior noise is what you would expect from a sports car, even as an SUV.  It's relatively quiet but under throttle and at speed there is a small amount of noise.  The Tiptronic is easy to use on the steering wheel or by using the shifter.  Using either gets you as close to driving a manual as you can and makes it even more fun when driving those back roads in Northern Virginia.

The problem is that it likes to drink oil.. I have had to put 6 qts of oil in the car so far. > 1qt for every 2K miles. I am not the only one , there are 11 pages on Renslist concerning this issue.

This TT is definitely a much improved car.
From being almost a ton lighter (helps maneuverability and speed) , 8 gears (quiet shift and the right gear at any speed), starts from 1st gear instead of 2nd (lighter gear box and better launch), PCCB (no break dust but still squeeks a bit), PDCC (keep turns level), vented sports seats, 4.6 seconds, touch screen navigation, and the list goes on...

porsche,cayenne,2011,itzsyk, 12/17/2011,Confused SUV,4,"Had this car for 5 months now, and I still regret not test driving it before signing the papers. Just got out of a RRS so I thought I'd give the Cayenne a try. The car is stupid fast. Almost to the point where driving at limit speeds is very boring. But the biggest thing that gets me is....what is it? It's not an SUV and it certainly isn't a 911. I'd rather go with a RR or X5 next time because if I wanted a sport car, I'd go pick up a proper 2dr. Also, the Cayenne felt very similar to the Panamera, which in my opinion, does not know if it's a sedan or a sports car as well."
porsche,cayenne,2011,Rich L, 08/23/2010,Excellent Redesign,4,"Purchased a 2011 Cayenne S in July.  The car has been excellent so far.  Go for the 19 or 20 inch wheels, the 18's are a little soft on hard corners.  Fast as Heck.  0 to 60 comes in 5.15, Porsche's estimates are high.  Interior is the best I have seen in an SUV.

porsche,cayenne,2011,ChadJamesR, 10/15/2010,Great SUV,4,"My wife loved the new look of the Cayenne so we decided to purchase one. It has been a great vehicle for the time we have owned it.  We bought the VR6 model instead of the V8 as the $14k increase in price didn't seem worth it.  The performance of the VR6 is everything you could want out of a SUV.  Gas mileage is great at around 23mpg during city driving and up to 27 mpg on trip to the airport.  If you want a sporty SUV and still have it practical, I don't know if there is a better vehicle on the market for you.  I gave it an 8 for performance as the V8 and TT give the ultimate performance. The ride is a little rough but what do you expect with this good of handling."

porsche,cayenne,2012,Gillman, 05/27/2018,Take The Plunge,5,"Bought my 2012 S in Sept of 2016 with 45k on the odometer.  Bose, 18ways, dubs.  Researched local mechanics to see if I could purchase my own parts for installation and there are many former dealer mechanics that understand the logic.  Have replaced all filters, and front pads with rotors just to be sure.  Change my own oil (you tube).  Still running orig. plugs at 66k, it's normally aspirated and the mpg (17.5 overall) suggests the logic holds, esp. with a smooth idle.  Had an X5 for a decade and averaged 16.5 with 225hp and a six, this 400hp eight screams, you can toss your blue pills.  I drove the six but a buddy told me to drive the eight before pulling the trigger and I'm still thanking him two years later, for a one mpg difference this bad boy is oh so light it's feet.  (n.b. i'm running regular gas only)  The Bose is more than you need, you may hurt yourself with it but Floyd never sounded so good.  At night on the interstate at 80 with the stereo tuned to your liking you are there, where there is, is your own personal choice but it's probably near your glory days.  I have never spent as much time in the 90's inadvertently, you'd best set the cruise.  Fit and finish is boffo, rubbed this out with Meguiars compound and waxed it and the metal flake gray is an inch deep, like nothing I've ever owned.  I'm a big guy and this thing swallows me whole, don't know about the back seats but my passengers are all smiling.  Paid 36k, bought a 4 year bumper to bumper for 3600, piece of mind baby!  At the time a new Traverse would have cost me the same, you choose.  Screw the bucket list, zip up your big boy pants and get one of these, it's about the day to day .

porsche,cayenne,2012,Sharon B, 01/23/2018,Best vehicle I’ve ever owned!,5,"I’ve had many cars and SUV’s over the years, and quite a few luxury cars, 2 Mercedes AMG’s, BMW 530i, Cadillacs, Ford Explorer, but none take a candle to the Porsche Cayenne S I currently own. The front seats are without a doubt the absolute most comfortable. It functions like an SUV, but it handles and performs like a sports car. One of my favorite features is the Porsche Dynamic Lighting System (PDLS) that links the headlights to the steering wheel, so there are no more blind curves or turns at night! It’s comfortable, quite, functional and most fun to drive. I’ve owned two Cayennes over the past 7 years and both have been awesome vehicles!
"
porsche,cayenne,2012,Banx, 07/27/2017,"Great performer, but pricey to maintain",4,"This vehicle has been fantastic to drive. With 500 hp, it accelerates 0-60 in about 4.4 seconds and there is zero turbo lag at any time. One big advantage of this model is the buttons on the console that allow the climate for driver or passenger to have air flow exactly as they wish in any combination of air flow outlets. The Bose sound is very good. The navigation system works well - this car doesn't have voice control. Heated steering wheel is very comfortable in the winter. The 16.35 mpg over the 22K miles I've been tracking it on a spreadsheet is 0.45 mpg less than what the trip computer has calculated. It requires 93 octane like all Porsches, so if you live in an area where 91 octane is the highest available, the ECU will not nearly give you the acceleration performance that this car could give you. Reliability has been relatively poor. At 35K, it needed a driveline transfer case and controller as well as a sunroof controller. Having the front brakes (rotors and pads) replaced was around $1950 - whoa! There is no oil dipstick; once the car has been driven a little while, a dash view of oil level can be seen in a submenu. This car has averaged needing a half-quart of Mobil 1 5w-40 added every 1060 miles (I just bought another 5-gallon jug of that oil on Amazon for $23). Cargo space in the rear is fine for us - it carries a few golf bags, etc. and has way more capacity than the Macan or Audi Q5. It also has slightly more space for cargo than the 2009 Lexus RX350 I'd had. One problem with the Cayenne is removing the retractable cargo cover shade entirely out of the bracket that holds it in place. It is a ridiculously tough chore!

Mixed impressions.
The Good: Super fast, sounds great, corners like no other, beautiful interior, roomy enough for four (five is tight), pano roof is awesome, sport mode changes character of car.

porsche,cayenne,2012,haap62, 01/24/2012,3 months in.,4,"Wow! This is the 1st car I've spent 6 figures on, and so far, so amazing! No issues as I would expect for 3k miles. 

It was very difficult to keep the RPM's below 4000 for the first 1000 miles. It drives like a Cadilac when you are just cruising, and roars off like a tiger on steroids when you ask it to. Plus we are averaging 18mpg in town and 21 hwy. Not bad for 500 HP. It replaced a very nice Landcruiser that on it's best day got 17mpg, with half the horse power.

The interior is more luxurious than any other car I have owned. I love the seats 18way adjustable bolsters fit wonderful, and I'm a big guy. 
Long story short, I love this SUV. Mine is black with 21"" black wheels. Lots of stares"

porsche,cayenne,2012,Ducatiman, 08/30/2020,Running like a Swiss watch at 162000 miles!!!,5,"Bought my 2012 Cayenne base from a Porsche dealer 1 year ago with 150000 miles on it. Was very nervous about the mileage, however, all dealer records were available, it was a one owner, and every single required service interval was documented with the Porsche dealer. After 12000 miles, I can honestly say it is the best vehicle I have ever owned. No issues whatsoever so far. The build quality is exceptional. No squeaks or rattles. Regularly gets 22 mpg with almost no oil consumption whatsoever. Cabin comfort is second to none. The 18 way adjustable leather seats cradle my torso perfectly. The headlights are truly remarkable with the ability to turn with the vehicle. Visibility is superb. Performance is exceptional and handling is predictable to the extreme. If you can find a well kept Cayenne, do not be afraid of the mileage. They are built to last.

If you like good ride go with Porsche. I recommend going V8 rather than V6. I test drove V6 but I was not happy for the price. Its better get ML 350 with V6. so far its been almost a month every one likes the car.
porsche,cayenne,2012,Stuart Renn, 08/12/2015,Turbo me to Planet Turbo!,5,"My first car, and what a beast! The inside would have you believe this is a stately Rolls, floating over road bumps as if they weren't there. Then you put your right foot down and all of a sudden it feels like a track car.
My spec list: PDCC, PTV+, full two-tone leather with wood handles and accents, 4.8l turbo, full Premium pkg plus (rear AC, adaptive cruise, pano roof, ...), air suspension with PASM, 14-way seats and importantly, sound insulated windows.

I love the quietness of this car - you can hardly hear smaller vehicles on the freeway. Engine sounds lovely, non-intrusive. I really appreciate the comfort of this car the most - air suspension feels like a flying carpet, I have it set on Comfort most of the time. 
The engine has instant power from low revs and gives out a lovely growl when woken up.

This is the ideal car for those who enjoy finer things in life.

After 16 mos I have no problems to report. This is my first hybrid auto so it took a few weeks to get used to the way the hybrid system works. I have tried to push it and man the power this car has is awesome. The growl makes me smile. Great brakes and those 21 inch sleek tires has amazing grip! Luxurious on the inside, supple leather and intuitive center console. I wake up every morning and open my garage to look at it and smile. I am pretty happy. The only cons I have is the depreciation I noticed after I bought the car, over 8k? That's after I looked at a few similar cars currently on sale. Poor nego skills on my part.

I bought what I thought was a loaded car, only to find that there is no voice control for the phone. You have to look at the dash, scroll through the phone list and select a name. We live in a hands free state!!!

Checked Porsche's website and found voice control is a 450.00 extra. Really, in an 85k car??

porsche,cayenne,2012,Christian G, 05/13/2019,A rip-off from start to finish,1,"I bought a 2012 Cayenne S and only had problems with that car. Never again Porsche! All of those problems can be traced back to bad manufacturing and are NOT driver related. AC broke down twice. The gear box broke twice. The entire headliner came down due to bad glue. The cooling system had a leak, the window lifters failed, the control knobs turn gooey like marshmallows, etc. BAD MANUFACTURING all around. I own other cars, and none of them have this litany of problems. Porsche repairs are generally way over-priced, e.g. a simple battery exchange costs around $ 900, because they designed it in a way such that only Porsche can do it, and - yes you guessed right - Porsche abuses the monopoly by over-charging for simple things. If you buy a Porsche, you are signing up to getting ripped off and cheated out of your money. Porsche is owned by Volkswagen, which is the worst liar and cheater in the car business. Volkswagen committed the insolent and massive diesel emissions scandal. The attitude of cheating and lying permeates from the mother company down to the Porsche subsidiary. Do yourself a favor and don't buy from such weasels.

The handling is superb, acceleration outstanding, great look, very reliable and smooth powerful engine. Drive one and you be the judge.  Fantastic and well built German car. The sound of that V8 just make you go faster and faster. Naturally aspirated V8 is the best. I've had tuned 996 turbo in past and I tell you Porsche makes great cars. I had to buy a SUV and when I saw the Cayenne GTS and drove it, I loved every minute of it and I decided to get it. No disappointments for sure, very minor stuff to fix which every car has it these days. New Cayenne GTSs has twin turbo V6 but V8 is something else. Porsche all the way !!!

after bringing in my car for loud clanging noises when I backed the car up, they replaced my entire catalytic converter.
Ten days later, due to different clanging noises, they replaced all of my muffler tips and replaced my electronic key fobs as the car was not recognizing them.
Are you kidding me?
I should have bought the Range Rover Sport for $40,000 less from the dealer less than a mile from my home.
My neighbors who have bought Range Rovers have reported no such major repairs and certainly not to a brand new vehicle."

porsche,cayenne,2014,DrBillyD, 12/23/2015,An SUV that thinks it's a sports car...,5,"Previous vehicle was a MB GL550.  Cayenne obviously much more sporty.  Ride on stock 21"" wheels/tires pretty stiff, even with diminished tire pressure. I sprang for 19"" winter wheels/tires (Blizzaks) and ride much smoother.  Acceleration, braking, handling are all insane--hard to believe you're driving a 2.5 ton SUV.  What's not to like?  Not much.  Rear visibility stinks (but Lane Change Assist is nice).  Ambient interior lighting OK for city but need to turn off on lonely highway at night.  Seat memory function on key kind of finicky--need to insert key, wait for seat to adjust, then start, otherwise seat will stop adjusting when you turn ignition.  Girlfriend complains about difficulty getting out but when I help her exit I get a nice view, and get to act like a gentleman in the process.  

Fuel economy stinks, if it's anything like the GL550, it's gonna eat tires every 20K or so and I'm sure repair bills will be breathtaking.  If you get a Porsche and then complain about things like that, well, might be time to trade it in.

Update:  Took a 2000 mile road trip and performed well. Nice cruiser when suspension set to ""comfort"" mode. On a long highway cruise with speedo set @ 78mph, got 22 MPG.  Could use more storage/cupholders in the center console and less switches.  Some of the metallic trim on the dash, vent covers, etc. can reflect sunlight and be irritating.  Wish the sun visor extended so that when it's moved to cover the driver side window there wasn't a 2"" gap that the sun *always* seems to find.  Minor issues but other manufacturers have figured out ergonomics.

Update: Just turned 30K. Changed spark plugs, cabin & engine air filters, and transfer case fluid myself. Have not had any transfer case issues. Installed secondary cat bypasses... nice sound! Summer tires replaced at about 18K, with Michelin, didn't like OEM PZeroes. No issues & still running like a champ.

porsche,cayenne,2014,BillR, 04/14/2016,DieselNice but...,3,"This is the 3.0 Diesel. Bought new Aug 2014 4 weeks later left me stranded 150 miles from home (bad computer connector) Terrible and expensive dealer service. I've had it to 3 different dealers, all pretty much the same. $300. for an oil change, $300 for wheel alignment. Porsche requires oil changes every 5,000 miles but Audi requires oil changes every 10,000 mile on the same engine which Audi makes.

My Cayenne has the Porsche Dynamic Lighting System (PDLS). The system has great features but are dangerous on hilly terrain. The headlights have a sharp cutoff at the top of the beam so when you approach a hill, you can't see beyond the base of the hill. I drive in an area with a lot of wildlife and I have to drive slowly, that's not what I bought a Porsche for. Dealer says the lights are per factory specs and they can't do anything about them. Porsche refuses to do anything. Another issue Porsche refuses to do anything about, the speedometer reads high, between 6% and 8%. The dealers tell me all Cayennes read the same as mine. Quite a scam, people think they are getting much better gas mileage and everyone gets shorted on their warranty (odometer shows over 50,000 miles but you actually only have 47,000 miles.

On the plus side, it rides and handles great and has the best seats I've ever had. It pulls my 6,000+ pound boat with ease. Mileage on the diesel is great (I get around 30 mpg highway factoring in the odometer error but $600. in oil changes in 10,000 miles more than negates the advantage over the gas engine. They have not corrected the pollution issue with my diesel yet so I don't know what affect it will have on my mileage or use of adblue.

Update, they have performed the Diesel fix to make the vehicle compliant with emission standards. The engine still runs well but the transmission is not as responsive as it was so you don't get the instant surge of power as before. The vehicle has been 100% reliable since it stranded me a month after purchase. Porsche still refuses to do anything about the unsafe headlights and the grossly inaccurate odometer and speedometer. Porsche got caught in one scam (Dieselgate) but is still getting away with the inaccurate speedometers and odometers so people think they are going faster and getting better mileage than they really are.

porsche,cayenne,2014,GP, 02/09/2017,One of the best,5,"I've owned a few luxury SUV's but I have always felt they were lacking in one area or another.  Be it reliability or overall features and style.  I can't complain with the Porsche.  What I consider flaws or poor design are so insignificant overall that I can't be bothered writing about it.  This is a magnificent machine with incredible pedigree and quality.  If you are on the fence about purchasing one just simply walk into the dealership and open and close the door.  You will instantly feel how well built this vehicle is.  The performance is great and the comfort of the seats is beyond anything I have ever owned. If you can stretch the budget to afford one then you are in for a real treat!

porsche,cayenne,2014,KDC1959, 10/15/2020,Porsche Cayenne GTS - what a beast!,5,"My last four SUVs have been BMW X5s. All but the last were Sport models. I was a very happy owner of each (although they're deathly expensive when out of warranty). Last vehicle was a 2019 X5. Utter disappointment. Seems BMW went to fully electronic steering since I had last bought one. What a mistake. The car had zero steering feedback and was as dead as disco when on center. The electronics were maddening and a perfect example of ""technology for the sake of technology"". Hated it. Owned it three weeks and traded it for a 30,000 mile 2014 Cayenne GTS. It is like going from driving a soccer mom mobile to a high performance go-kart. I was particularly interested as this was the last model year of the big, naturally aspirated V-8. Uncredible acceleration. Handling is precise and the car doesn't try to entertain you with electronics. I'm an analog guy in a digital world and a little electronic wizardry goes a very long way with me. This is a car that demands your attention and input and rewards you. I would suggest you finish your frapacchino and put your smart phone away before piloting this one. Not to say it's not civilized. Fit and finish are legendary and nothing sounds like that V-8 when you twist the ingition.

porsche,cayenne,2014,DRogers76, 08/29/2019,Amazing bang for the buck,5,"I have owned my 2014 Porsche Cayenne Diesel for 1.5 years now and it has been amazing! I typically get close to 650 miles on a single tank at about a 29.4MPG clip. I only put about 5k miles annually on mine since I work from home. Not putting a lot of miles on it does make getting an oil change at Porsche a bit easier on the wallet. Oil changes are 589 out the door every 5k miles. I have 45,000 miles on my 2014 Cayenne Platinum S Diesel. I have the same tires on it that came on it brand new, because I dont rag it out.

What I love
- Love the look and feel of it, inside and out
- sports car feeling while driving and dont feel like I am in an SUV
- Fuel Efficiency 650 miles per tank, 29mpg all day long
- Porsche didnt put Pirelli on the Cayenne, thank god!

What I think is just ok
- Look and feel of the steering wheel, the buttons are a bit clunky
- The material on the steering wheel is cheap and after a few years starts to rub off

What I dont like
- cost of the maintenance, but when you buy a porsche you have to be able to afford the maintenance...you cant just go to jiffy lube.

Overall
- I would own another Cayenne and will probably not buy another SUV.

porsche,cayenne,2014,jim, 07/11/2015,"Fast, responsive luxury - awkward Navigation...",4,"...Too hot in summer. For an SUV, this car hadles like a dream.  It is black on black. I live in SW Florida and the Porsche replaced a black on black Cadillac SRX that I drove for eight years. The SRX was never too hot upon entry, even in summer and cooled down very quickly. The Cayenne is unbeleivably hot upon entry and takes four times longer to cool down on a summer day. I have never been in a car of any make or color that gets so hot. The reason is because the ventilation completely closes when the car is off. Good for northern Europe. Bad for south Florida.    The gps works but it is difficult to determine which route to select. It often gets you off the highway much too early. I prefer my iPhone for navigation.  Update: I recently had a rodent chew through a wire on the airbag system. The ONLY repair Porsche would perform was a total rewire of the ENTIRE vehicle which meant completely deconstructing the entire interior and most of the car at a cost of over $25,000. The extended warranty would not cover it. I took it to a classic car electrician who fixed it for $300. Still I like car and will continue to drive until the extended warranty is up.

porsche,cayenne,2016,Banx, 01/31/2018,Great vehicle,5,"2/2019 update: Edmunds asked for an update from the 17,060 odometer reading. It now has 19,810 miles on odometer. Fuel average is now at 15.3 mpg, using 93 octane, with a 50/50 mix of city and highway. Oil additions are now at an average of needing a half-quart of Mobil 1 0w-40 added every 946 miles, but 1 standard deviation is 513 miles; the lowest it has gone before needing a half quart added was 356 miles and the longest was 2084 miles - 2nd longest was 1511 miles. There have been no maintenance issues yet.

We traded in our '12 Turbo (500 hp) for this used but certified '16. Both the '12 and '16 had/have the sport chrono pkg. The buttons on the center console area are very easy to use. This vehicle has been fantastic to drive. With 520 hp, it accelerates 0-60 in about 4.2 seconds and there is zero turbo lag at any time. One big advantage of this model is the buttons on the console that allow the climate for driver or passenger to have air flow exactly as they wish in any combination of air flow outlets. The Bose sound is very good, way better than the Harmon Kardon in our two Mercedes cars (wagon and CLS) that have the weakest bass sound ever. The navigation system works well - this car doesn't have voice control (note: Mercedes nav is horrible). Heated steering wheel is very comfortable in the winter. The 15.6 mpg over the 8900 miles I've been tracking it on a spreadsheet is 0.3 mpg less than what the trip computer has calculated. The EPA, which always overstates mpg, has it rated as 14/21 for city/hwy. It requires 93 octane like all Porsches, so if you live in an area where 91 octane is the highest available, the ECU will not nearly give you the acceleration performance that this car could give you. Reliability has been fine so far (expect to pay about $2K when the front brakes (rotors and pads) are replaced). There is no oil dipstick; once the car has been driven around 10 miles, a dash view of oil level can be seen in a submenu. This has averaged needing a half-quart of Mobil 1 0w-40 added every 870 miles, which is about normal for their twin turbo V-8. Cargo space in the rear is fine for us - it carries a few golf bags, etc. and has WAY more trunk capacity than the Macan or Audi Q5. While I'd love a Macan, they're just too small in the cargo area and the front leg area is too short for me. One problem with Cayennes is removing the retractable cargo cover shade entirely out of the bracket that holds it in place. It is a ridiculously tough chore! This '16 has the sport exhaust option and the sound is quite exciting outside the vehicle, but you barely hear it inside - it sounds much more thrilling on this V-8 than on the Cayenne V-6 loaner I got. While we have a locking differential control, we've only used it a couple of times while clambering up a snowy, pine-covered trail to a camp. If you really need that go anywhere capability, I'd guess the Range Rover would be the one to get. This came with summer tires - as soon as it got cold I took them off and put on all-season tires on the 21 inch wheels. The ride would be a bit more comfortable on rougher roads with smaller wheels. The LED low beam headlights have a sharp cutoff - I'd prefer them to light up more of the road in front of us. There is an extremely annoying start/stop function - even though we turn it off, the '16 resets itself to ""on"" each time the engine is turned off. That split second, when you don't realize the start/stop is functioning and you're turning left while seeing oncoming traffic, and you'll understand what I mean. You're saving a few cents a week in gas but the starter is being used 20 times a day - what'll that Porsche starter cost to replace after the warranty is up? This has parking sensors front and rear that work very well (those in our Mercedes are useless), and the blind spot monitors are good too. Fortunately, the cruise control is NOT the
 adaptive option - I do not like those. Heated and ventilated seats work very well in front - the rear only has the base heated seats. Transmission has worked flawlessly so far.

porsche,cayenne,2016,Sean, 02/13/2017,Its a Porsche for a reason,4,"I have had this vehicle for almost a year now coming from a bigger and somewhat slower SUV ( Full-Size Range Rover)  this Porsche is a performance vehicle and once you step on the gas you feel it. The breaking system is unbelievable precise (also very expensive to replace via the dealer) the infotainment and interior design is that of airplane if your familiar Porsche then its pretty easy if not it could get confusing. Sometimes I wish the in dash screen could be a little bigger. For the size of the Cayenne the trunk space is kind of disappointing barely can hold anything . I was so use to my range rover being a rough off road vehicle so nyc potholes didnt really bother as the air suspension would absorb the bulk of it in the Porsche the suspension is more tuned for performance so I feel more of the road while driving.The handling on this vehicle decent its not better than BMW around corners but does a good job  All in all its a great performance SUV for a good price just a little pricey on maintenance if I were to do it all over again I probably would go up a model to the S or GTS thats just the inner speed demon in me though

porsche,cayenne,2016,Richard Seban, 07/12/2016,Great Surprise,5,"We are now over 50K and the car is the same as it was when it was new. The is our second Cayenne and we love it.  The diesel has over 700 miles in range and with the air flow seats it is so comfortable only bathroom breaks are necessary.  We just took a road trip (5000 miles) and the car performed perfectly.  Can't say enough good things about it.  Worth every penny!
We have now owned the car for three years and it has 35,000 miles. The car is as good as it was when it was new. We had the emissions adjusted to confirm but we were reimbursed for our inconvenience. The only negative is the cost of oil changes which ranges from $250 to $400 every 5,000 miles.

Check up's tend to be more expensive than other cars but this car is worth every penny. Built like a tank, it is the Swiss Army Knife of vehicles. I tow several boats with it, drive in dirt fields, and fly down the interstate. LED headlights are some of the best I have seen and it drives like a sports car with confident handling.

porsche,cayenne,2016,Mike C, 01/13/2017,Awesome Demonstration of Technology & Design,5,"When purchasing such a vehicle, you need to match your driving needs and expectations to the platform.  The results with the Cayenne can be fantastic.  The Cayenne handles unbelievably well for an SUV/CUV.  The turning radius is likely the tightest I've ever experienced for a car, truck, or SUV.  We ended up purchasing the e-hybrid because most of our driving is local (less than 50 miles) and the hybrid offers excellent overall MPG (~45 to 50 MPG) while still providing enough power and torque (along with the legendary Porsche handling) to make driving fun.  This is our first hybrid and having previously owned a Tesla Model S, I can honestly say that the instrumentation in the e-hybrid Cayenne is comprehensive, logical, and very well thought out.
"
porsche,cayenne,2016,qnf, 09/18/2016,Beware...no spare!,3,"After exhaustive research, I was very excited to buy my very first Porsche. Ordered exactly what I wanted and was able to track on the boat from the factory. The first 5 months of ownership was great. The lime green brakes were very eye-catching. The mileage was great.. Based on my driving pattern, was able to get about 50mpg. The only complaint was a noticeable lag on acceleration when going from electric to gas when the battery was drained but that was not a big deal. Then at about month 6, the engine light came on for no reason. All the other gauges were fine and the car ran well. Brought it into the dealership for servicing. They ran their diagnostics and said that there was a valve that had to be tightened. They did that and the car ran ok for about a week then the engine light went on again. Brought it back in and they had to change out the valve. Got it back and then a week later, same thing again. Brought it back in again. This time, they had to change out the whole system there. So far, no problem there. However, tire got slashed one day at office by bored high schoolers walking through parking lot on way home from school. Called AAA. Come to find out that the hybrid do not have spare tire because there is no space secondary to battery. Then had to wait for flat-bed tow truck in deserted parking lot at night. Just something to keep in mind if you are researching cars these days. Porsche hybrids and their sport cars will not have spare tires. I have owned lexus, audi, mercedes...never have had this much trouble with a new car!!

After having the car for a year, I have had no further problems. I plug in pretty consistently and, based on my driving habits, still get about 45-50mpg. There is a definite lag going from electric to gas. Knowing that, I turn off the electric mode purposefully when I know that I have to accelerate fast. It does not accelerate like my husband's Tesla but overall nice ride.

Only problem has been premature leather seat wear (quite common), sport exhaust corrosion and tail light delamination/quality concerns. Porsche addressed all free of charge to me replacing nearly $4,000 in parts under warranty. Otherwise no mechanical issues at all at 40,000 miles. Original tires near end of life. Otherwise incredibly reliable.  Quality of parts just not there, especially when costs are considered.  I will not keep it much longer as maintenance costs will simply be too high for what it is. Dealer wants $100 to mount one tire, $400 for an alignment, $350 for an oil change, $2,000 for a tune-up that consists of about $300 in parts. Brakes are multi-thousand dollar repairs per axle!  Yet the quality of these parts are sub par to Japanese autos!!!!  Is it fast and does it handle great?  Yes. But, so do cars half the price that are much easier on the wallet to maintain.

This car has so many design flaws that a light hit to the rear end and the car should be totaled.  It's engineering is so poor that they put the battery under the seat and access to exhaust required too much labor to include removal of a body panel.  The seat just from a mediocre accident caused the rear passenger seats bolt that secures them to the floor break.  Mind you the airbags did not even go off in this accident.  That same tap to the rear caused a total of 4700.00 worth of mechanical damage due to the horror story of engineering.  Take a pass on buying this it is going to be a Fix or Repair Daily vehicle.  Being in the VW family should we have expected anything less?

porsche,cayenne,2017,Wayne, 06/10/2018,1 year ownership review,5,"I got the car last year and had driven it for about 8000 miles. For interior, Cayenne hybrid build quality is great. The car had practicality in mind without overdone and over engineering. I would consider MB interior are overdone with too much distraction, Tesla features are over-engineering. I am OK with some of the plastic on the switches. That's how you keep the weight down. It is not Rolls or Bentley nonetheless. For performance, the acceleration is good(about 5.4s from 0-60). Brake is very sensitive. For reliability, I expect Porsche reliability is great. So far, no problem what-so-ever from my car. So, I will consider it excellent. This car has a very steep learning curve, it can achieve most of the stuff it promised, but you just need to take some time to learn and understand how this machine work. For example, one reviewer complain that the in-car navigation cannot be cancelled. Actually, it can be cancelled pretty easily. just wave you hand in front of the navigation. The proximity sensor will bring up optional choice to cancel the current destination. Climate control is automatic. you can turn off the AC with the AC button. Heat will come-in automatically once you set the temperature. So, I am very pleased with its comfort during the harsh winter. Fuel economy is also great if you know how to use it, cruise control on high speed can save you a lot of fuel, especially during downhill and soft braking. I only refilled my tank 6 times from initial 100 miles in odometer(I admit I charge my car a lot). 1 tank of fuel supposed to last for 400 miles only. I especially like the full electric mode that is literally like a second set of engine that you can use in most light weight short distant city driving.  With my current driving habit, I expect this car to last for a long time. Porsche engineering is up there, you got what you pay for, for such powerful and complicated machine, you have got to take some time to learn how to use it properly. One last thing I want to say is, Cayenne hybrid is like having an option to drive a hybrid or a Porsche. If you drive like a hybrid, it delivers great fuel economy and quiet comfort, don't expect super fast acceleration and exciting throttle noise in this mode. If you drive like a Porsche under sport plus mode, it deliver great handling and good acceleration, but the fuel economy will not be good(~23mpg in pure gas engine). With Porsche, you are the driver with options.

porsche,cayenne,2017,VWB, 07/06/2019,2017 V6,3,"I purchased my SUV basic V6 in 2018 from a pvt party w only 5k miles.  The Car was flawless. Amazing in Sport mode. I already have 50k on it. Now... not so good: The service at the Dealer was over the top and my dealership (Asheville NC)  was really REALLY bad. Was told I had to wait 2 month for an oil change because only had 1 service guy because no one wanted to work for them!  I found a local shop that does the work  and it was s very affordable. Oil change was a simple $120. The only thing I have done to it has been a Wash n wax!  Quality car for sure.. but there is more:  There is a problem with All of these Vehicles. It's the ""TRANSFER CASE issue"". The cars starts to slip around 40k. This is a know consumer problem and Porsche ignores it and won’t take any responsibility. It makes me think twice if I will ever buy a Porsche (any Porsche) again.  2nd time I had a problem w a Porsche. A very simple problem at that.  Apparently my “TRANSFER CASE” is a known problem w Porsche as many cars have had the problem and I believe it includes 2017 models and I believe a few years before. Not sure about 2018 or 19. Porsche claims they know nothing about it, but when you read the Porsche reviews they seem to all have the same problem. ""TRANSFER CASE"" I was told by my mechanic that it will slowly get worse over time and will need to be prepared. Around 4k+ So unfortunately I bought a wrong year SUV! I will attempt one more time to have Porsche do the repair and if not then there I will start up a Class Action Law suit and force Porsche to do the repair at their expense. This is rather unfortunate for such a wonderful Vehicle and a big let down by Porsche Corporation USA.  Will I buy another Porsche... unfortunately probably not!  And the resale of this Auto is embarrassing low....

There are many problems highlighted online that the paid test drivers won't tell you. Driver controls and gauges are very poorly placed and designed.  Passenger side dash is an  obnoxious protrusion and hazardous in even medium sunlight. Engine and drive line require software updates that customer service and most dealers don't want you to know about.  They are covered under warranty but very expensive out of warranty.  Transfer case issues are common. PCM issues are mysterious and PCNA refuses to address. Tire and brake wear are far worse than competition.  STAY AWAY from the 17 and 18 Cayenne.

porsche,cayenne,2017,NJ, 03/28/2017,Not sure if I would get another one,4,"Porsches are mostly about performance and less about luxury. I love the look of my car inside and out and how it accelerates and handles in traffic.  But when it comes to all rhe extra stuff, like navigation, clock, mileage odometer, seat settings, etc., my car is already starting to show it's age with only 24k miles.  The hands free bluetoorh has never worked, the seat settings sometimes decide to change to a different driver, the clock doesn't always reset itself, the trip odometer stopped resetting a few months ago. I'm just disappointed that Porsche couldn't do better. My Subaru never had any of these issues and I had it for 7 years.  Also my tires are just wearing very unevenly and I already had to have them replaced once!  Again, I  only have 24,000 miles on this car.

porsche,cayenne,2017,George Gregory, 06/21/2019,Oil Hog,3,"I purchased the car with about 5000 miles on it and was initially excited. Within two months of my purchase the oil light came on. It has now been almost two years since i purchased the car and it has been in the shop easily every 3 months for the oil consumption issue. The car burns about one quart of oil every 800 to 900 miles. I was told numerous reasons by the dealer for the oil burn (e.g., it is a high performance engine and they all burn oil; it doesn't burn enough oil that would trigger the warranty, etc.). It is extremely frustrating to pay $$$$$ for the car and then be told there is nothing that they can do about the oil burn. Finally, the sales person never mentioned anything about the oil consumption.

One year later from my initial review, Porsche has replaced the engine but the car still burns oil. Must be an engine design issue. I have to give them points for trying to fix the problem but for a high premium brand auto manufacturing which prides itself on providing high performance technically advanced products it is very disappointing to this oil burn issue for so long.

Note that this is the old generation Cayenne, not the new 2018 that comes out mid year.  The maintenance costs are very high ($400 for an oil change for example) because it is a ""performance vehicle"" when in fact it is slower than a Jeep Grand Cherokee.   Another disappointment was when using Apple Carplay, the controls on the steering wheel for skipping to the next song (if you configure the spare button for that) do not work.  Neither does making phone calls - you have to use Apple Carplay via the touch screen unless you unplug the iPhone and it falls back to bluetooth.

porsche,cayenne,2018,WJL, 12/08/2018,Posh Porsche,5,"Updated 12 Dec 2020: Some minor changes made to the original review. Fantastic car. I now have 60K miles on it, commute in heavy traffic, mpg remains unchanged and it has had no significant maintenance issues (I do all of Porsche's recommended maintenance at the dealership). 



Original Review:

Pros:
I bought the base model at a great price, it was the dealership loaner for almost a year, it had 8000 miles on it.  I commute about 60 miles a day in heavy traffic to work in it. I get about 25 mpg, lower if traffic comes to a standstill. I have had no problems with it in the 10 months I have owned it. It is a pleasure to drive. Took it on a trip to the mountains and the performance was great at 12,000 ft above sea level. The road handling was awesome on the mountain roads. I traded a Cayman S for it and do not miss the minor obvious performance differences. The obvious difference in comfort and luxury over the Cayman are very noticeable, and really nice - no regrets about the trade. The standard (not adaptive) cruise control on it is the best I have ever used. It is very intuitive and quick to activate, and accurately maintains the set speed whether you are going steeply uphill, steeply downhill, or flat. I use very easily and safely in traffic on my daily commute, and it saves gas. When available in an area, the automatic traffic/re-routing system on the built in Porsche Nav system is the most impressive I have ever seen, much better than Waze. (The Porsche online Nav System remained impressive, but not available where I live and drive most, so I stopped paying for the subscription and use the built in sat nav system or online programs on my iPhone such as Waze. )

Cons:
The standard rear view driver’s side mirror has a dangerous blind spot that cannot be adjusted for. There is a warning light that illuminates on it when a vehicle is in collision range, but this light can be inadvertently turned off by the mirror adjustment controls. Porsche makes an alternate mirror which I paid $140 to buy and install at the dealership. It totally eliminates the blind spot, but the vehicles in it are much, much closer than they appear in the mirror, so it is dangerous to use alone without actually looking, to pull into the left lane. This takes your eyes off of the car in front of you. If you leave a safe gap between you and the car in front of you, in the heavy traffic I drive in, usually someone fills it. Bottom line, changing lanes is both aggravating and dangerous. I have never had a car with mirrors as bad as this one.

The entertainment system works with an iPhone, but not seamlessly. There is a large learning curve, and it is intermittently aggravating.

porsche,cayenne,2019,PorscheFanGuy, 12/09/2019,"2019 Cayenne Hybird, so close, yet so far away...",3,"This is my third Porsche. My other two cars right now are a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland Diesel and a 981 Boxster S (manual). The car was leased new and has around 600 miles on it so these are initial impressions. 

Lets address the pros first. The car is very fast and handles exceptionally well. When is Sport or Sport + the car accelerates faster than my Boxster S (or at least feels that way) and handles the curves superbly well. The seats are comfortable and there is a lot of room in the back seat. The battery gives you about 20 miles of range on fully electric which is speedy enough to get you around short errands easily. 

Now for the cons. First, my vehicle had an MSRP of around $91K so pretty basic trim. Premium package plus the ventilated seats. But this is still $91K! I compare that against what I got in my Jeep Grand Cherokee (~$45K) and the value is simply not there (even for a Porsche). 

Second, the are some pretty bad fit and finish quality issues. The paint is a joke and will scratch and get holes it in as if it were Play Doh. It also has an area where it looks like the paint dripped. How this got through quality control in Bratislava is concerning. I've toured the factory in Stuttgart and it wouldn't have gotten through those guys. I had to get ceramic coating because the paint is so bad and its a lease! There are also panels inside the car that do not align well (e.g., A pillar). Finally, I hear rattles with certain radio songs (at moderate volume) and it just doesn't seem as well put together as the JGC when going over bumps which is nuts to say about a Porsche.

Third, with the government subsidy the e-hybrid is the one to get over the S but if I were buying and not leasing I'd get the base. The hybrid tech is truly amazing (good job to the engineers), its hard to tell when the vehicle goes from electric to gas. However, if I were planning on owning (as opposed to leasing) I'd worry long-term about the impact of the hybrid drive and power train on the engine. The car needs to engage the ICE engine at any time (even if cold) and it will constantly need to go back and forth which is a lot for any engine to handle. The range of 20 very limiting and once its over, you don't have the speed anymore (just the weight). Overall, if you want an electric car, get a Tesla Porsche is just not there yet and the uncertainty of long-term residuals is too much to buy vs. lease. Plus the tech is changing at an exponential rate.

Fourth: Porsche, please go pick up a 2014-2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee and make it a required course for the folks who design your ergonomics. I've had Jeep, Toyota, Nissan, MB, and other Porsches and this is the worst ergonomic design I've ever seen. Simple things like being able to select previous track on the steering wheel, hang grocery bags in the back seats (or rear), and ability to easily control music are impossible in the new Cayenne. The controls look great but I think this car is a step back in this respect relative to the previous generation. 

Fifth: The Bose Stereo system is not great. I have a lot of Bose products (e.g., headphones, speakers, stereo in Boxster) and this one is just not as good. It sounds only slightly better than the system in my JGC. I've tried every setting combination, multiple different sources, and even Tidal which streams at more than CD quality. Its just not a great system. 

Having owned a couple of other Porsches, this doesn't feel of the same quality. Frankly it doesn't feel special. I think they need to bring the production back to Germany ASAP. Will report back after a few months.

porsche,cayenne,2019,Tin, 12/27/2018,This SUV Begs to go Fast,5,"We owned this 2019 Cayenne 3.0T Awd for close to 3 months. After initial Break-In. This car screams. We get to take it on a road trip from Los Angeles to Las Vegas to Valley of Fire at Moapa. Cruising at 85mph seems like it’s moving at 55mph. The handling is so superb, like a smaller car. This SUV begs to go fast. This SUV likes to be cruising at 90+ mph and the 8 speed transmission keeps the RPM around 2K. At 95-100mph, the cabin is quiet with very little wind noise. Acceleration up the grades are just half throttle and when u look at the speedometer, your flying up at triple digits. Braking to slow down for traffic is effortless. Going through the turns, there are very little body roll. Interior have lots of leg room for both front and rear passengers. Seats are comfortable. Control layouts gets a little used to but once figured out. Everything is easy to navigate. This is Truly the Ultimate Family Sports SUV

porsche,cayenne,2019,JCFloridaGirl, 08/11/2019,From a woman's perspective!,5,"Let me begin by saying, I don't know much about cars and this is my first Porsche purchase.  I drove EVERY other mid-size luxury SUV and found the Cayenne to be the most fun to drove and that's ultimately why I bought it.  When it came down to it for me....it was the Cayenne or the 2020 GLE Mercedes (I'm a REALTOR and needed a roomy back seat for clients).  I think the technology was far superior and preferred in the Mercedes, but as one astute salesman said, ""It's like driving a couch behind a steering wheel.""  I needed the comfort of an SUV but I wanted it to have the feel of a sports car.  The Cayenne has the power and space of a truck, but with the new '19 design, drives like a sports car.  SO FUN!  I agree with all edmunds complaints.  And living in Florida....the fan noise for the A/C (especially when I have clients in the car) is annoying.  Here are my pet peeves (sharing in case Porsche is watching because I think I'm hooked for life!): I think it's dangerous that the car has to be on and gas running in order for the garage door opener function to work.  Most people open the garage door first....then turn on their car.  As a single woman, and for safety reasons, I always make sure I'm in my locked car before opening the garage door (so please don't tell me to use the wall switch). You can't do that in the Cayenne.  After owning the car for a week, I left it outside overnight.  When I woke up, the rotors looked rusted.  I panicked and went onto a forum and learned you just need to drive it to kick off the rust.  Nonetheless...disappointing but maybe there's no way around this.  I wash/detail my own car/wheels every week myself...I don't like how the water drains.  It rains every day in Florida in the summer and when I open doors (like the rear hatch), days later, water comes out.  I have the attractive spyder wheels (they are a pain to clean by the way....do yourself a favor and buy the chemical guys' wheel woolies-best thing I ever did).  But there is ALWAYS dirt kicked up by the wheels.  I can wash my car, and later that day it looks like it needs to be washed/detailed again.  For this reason, I wish I had driven to AZ to get the rhodium silver Cayenne I really wanted (I purchased the Biscay Blue in FL and it's VERY hard to keep clean although EVERYBODY raves about the color).  The interior sleek black glass gets finger prints quickly; I keep a polishing cloth and spray in my console.  As one other review said....when you slow down....the transmission gets clunky.  I previously had a VW so I'm used to this. My number one frustration is the intrusive sound/security features.  They can be heard while on the telephone by the person on the other line.  I appreciate Porsche's concern for my safety....but these alarms are off the rails.  During my first service, I'm going to see if there's anything they can do to shorten or terminate them.  I work on a small Island.  Sometimes I leave the office just to get to a house that's two blocks away, driving 15 mph.  The seat belt reminder continues to SCREAM for MINUTES.  I also find the warnings distracting while I drive.  Once someone pulled out in front of me and the collision warning that flashed on my dash and the loud alarm, actually caused me to take my eyes off the road.  I wish the seats were more comfortable...softer.  They are pretty stiff.  Also, when you're driving with the sunroof open...the air doesn't flow like it should.  You get that helicopter sound....  I've only ever owned cars with sunroofs and never had this problem before.  It's remedied by cracking the windows.  I only share these complaints so that Porsche works on fixing them.  I don't in any way regret the purchase.  In short, you're buying what's under the hood. Everything else is nice but pretty expected in this price point.  I have always preferred German engineering, I like the simplicity.

porsche,cayenne,2019,Bob Martin, 12/23/2018,Point and shoot SUV,5,"Unbelievable handling for a car of this size, that makes you feel it is smaller than it really is. Acceleration for the base model is more than adequate for my needs, making merging on the freeway effortless. Build and quality is immediately apparent when you enter this vehicle, just what you expect from Porsche. Me and my wife debate who gets to drive all the time. In this price segment for top tier SUV’s , there is no question the Cayenne is the right choice.

porsche,cayenne,2019,sunny, 12/20/2019,Poorly built . Even worse customer service,2,"I have been having constant issues with the car . In 6 months and at about 6.5k miles , the car has been in the repair shop for over 30 days . The issues are serious. 

1. Trunk opens randomly when car is in motion . Very dangerous issue . Worse , there is no error code . I was told by the dealership that Porsche knows there is an issue in some 2019 and possibly 2020 Cayennes but don’t have a fix yet.

2. Squeaky brakes . As another reviewer said , totally unacceptable in a 80-90k car . Worse, the dealers will tell you that it’s acceptable because it’s a race car and solution is to brake hard.

3. ACC and PAS have stopped working and service required message appeared twicr. Dealership has changed 4 modules and failed to fix the issue . Worse , they claim that Porsche Tech Line is not responsive.

4. Nav screen has gone black suddenly and doesn’t work until restarting vehicle many times.

Do I have a lemon , possibly . The customer service has been poor until I talked about the Lemon Law. Overall , the ride is fantastic and I love the pickup , handling and responsiveness but it’s not worth the safety issues which could cause a serious accident.

I would recommend staying away .

porsche,cayenne,2019,Kevin, 01/26/2019,2019 Porsche Cayenne - The Real Deal,5,"We were shopping for a new vehicle and narrowed it down to three vehicles: BMW X5, Range Rover HSE Sport, or a Porsche Cayenne.  There is no comparison.  The Porsche Cayenne is the best.  X5 is nice, but cheap feeling interior and not very comfortable.  RR Sport just does not have the quality fit, finish, and mechanical dependability.  The Porsche Cayenne is a work of art that is quite functional as well.  My wife is in love with her new Cayenne!

Update (7-28-20)  Still love the Cayenne.  Had a few more issues with car than I thought we should have.  Replaced all taillights for issues with edges of lights, software issues, and waiting 9 months for a new gas tank as it is making noise when idling for more than a minute or so.

porsche,cayenne,2019,DM Taylor, 12/29/2019,3rd time is a charm,4,"This is my 3rd Porsche. Previously owned a Boxster S and traded in a 2015 Macan S for the base 2019 Cayenne. Have put 4,000 miles on it over five months. Picked it over a Panamera. 

Likes are the interior which is the most comfortable and elegant I have seen. Actually prefer the Cayenne’s ZF transmission over the PDK in the Macan! The Macan was always sluggish to get the turbo to spin up. I always felt the programming was off.

The handling and acceleration are top shelf. Reliability has been bulletproof and the Biscayne Blue get s many compliments 

Dislikes: The Macan could scroll through my favorite radio stations using the thumb ball on the steering wheel, and also adjust volume. Can’t do that on the Cayenne. Macan also displayed the speed limit on the dash. Again missing from Cayenne. I have completely given up on using my foot to get the rear to open. It has never worked for me, and when the dealer tried it, most of the time they couldn’t get it to open either.

porsche,cayenne,2019,Lolina, 01/30/2019,The base car is great - well worth it,4,"Porsche delivers a solid performing SUV that has the polish and finishes you would expect in a luxury SUV. The base features put the value right where you would want it. Materials, ride quality, ergonomics and overall fun all are there. Like all vehicles, nothing is perfect, which is why there is a choice. The Seats, including the upgraded premium seats, are a bit more firm than needed. The options to get the seats in the right place, however, are great. The ride is smooth and the suspension is solid. Trying to go slow though you do notice the slightly clunky transmission. The big complaint is, of course, the extras. As a base level, you get a car substantially similar to its competitors in terms of features. However, Porsche instance to charge for the absolutely most stupid things is silly. I picked one off the lot and it had Porsche crests in it for $495. Why would I pay for their advertising? You cant put aftermarket roof rails on, but it is an 800$ option and a number of things to change colors are just silly. Otherwise, air suspension and advanced features are simply a choice. Expensive but some are worth it. Overall, however, it was by far the best value for the money I could get a SUV in its class. I test drove everything from a RRS, a GLE, F pace, and others. I do truly enjoy it, I just wish Porsche would get off their proverbial high horse and not answer every question with ""it's a Porsche"".  The Cayenne absolutely fuels the rest of the company and mostly it fuels it with base models and some features. ""its a Porsche"" is not a competitive answer... They could do better. Note: I have owned a 911 before so I am not new to the brand.

What is extremely annoying is wind noise above 75mph,  which the dealer said is normal. BS! Inexcusable on a car like this. And another big one for me is I can.t drive with the windows down, around  40 or so wind buffeting gets so bad it is unreal.

porsche,cayenne,2019,Sam hong, 11/21/2019,2019 cayenne customer review,1,"I live MD.
I bought the 2019 Cayenne from a Bethesda Porsche at 12/12/2018.
10 months later, I changed the cayenne to another car.
1.  2019 Cayenne has brake cracking noise, but there wasn’t no dealership who could solve this problem.
I left my car with a dealer in Towson for nine days, but the same problem happened. 
The dealer at Silver Spring didn't even know what was wrong and had no answer.
2.  There is a problem with the electrical system.
For example, Auto Headlights do not work. I know at some point the Auto Headlight should work because I always drive the same road every morning and evening.
3. There is a bounce when the auto mission shifts from one to three. 
4. Noise occurs at mufflers at a low speed of 5-10
5. Vibration is felt on the seat and the steering wheel when the air conditioner is operated.
In addition to these problems, there were many problems, but I was so stressed out that I just had to switch to another car.
But what's really amazing is that the cayenne I traded is sold at a certified used car in Porsche.
If you sell your vehicle, sell your location tracker as a compulsory option, and sell your Maintenance program option, and don't give your customer a money back when they switch to another car due to a defective vehicle, I think it's a fraud.
I think it was really the worst brand to sell the car, making a profit from the expedient, and the salesman sending a text message to the customer that he didn't receive the survey high scores that he asked for.
I won't even buy a Porsche in the future, but I think I should boycott it now.
The reason I raise this issue is to avoid other affected customers.
I really hope you will consider it carefully.
ps)If you want to buy Porsche in Maryland, avoid these two places. There are a lot of legal crooks.

porsche,cayenne,2019,Tom Danker, 10/09/2019,2019 Cayenne Hybrid - energy and economy,3,"I've owned my 2019 Cayenne Hybrid for about a month now.  It's a dream to drive.  The motor options of Sport and Sport plus mode makes it handle like a full time sports car.  Electric and Hybrid modes make your fuel last and last.
Lots of room for golf clubs and other camping gear.
The air conditioned seats are the absolute best in the desert.
Great combination.
One issue that was not disclosed when I purchased it was that the Apple Car Play installed in this car, is a stripped down black market version of the real Apple Car Play.   The Porsche designed Car Play software severely limits my ability to make phone calls.   Such a stupid move on Porsches part to downgrade an otherwise very great car.  I'm surprised Apple lets them put Apples name on it.

One bug like this can make an otherwise great experience painful.

Please have your dealer share ALL of the Apple Car Play features with you before you buy!

porsche,cayenne,2019,Nihar Ghate, 08/04/2020,Worst experience of my life,1,"When you test drive the car you want make sure to be aware that Porsche considers many abnormal things to be normal.  I am currently in arbitration about my vehicle.  Custom order cayenne turbo.  165k for my vehicle and it sounds like jalopy when it comes to stop.  Porsche considers themselves a drive experience like no other... they have that right.  Buying the car was the best experience I ever had the following year has been horrible.  Do your research and DO NOT get the PSCB brakes.  Horrible! They claim to be better then PCCB but spend the extra money and you won’t have to deal with squealing stops.  People don’t stare at you because you drive at 160k car they stare at you because the car makes endless high pitch squeals as it comes to a stop.  Recommendation is to wait 5 years until they come out with something better or look elsewhere for a high performance SUV.  I have multiple videos of this and picture of wiring harness coming loose on my brakes yet they claim this is normal.

porsche,cayenne,2020,Brian L, 08/05/2020,A Driver’s SUV,5,"Excellent vehicle. Buy a Cayenne if...
-You want the best handling mid-sized SUV in the world. Great handling, road feel, break feel. Look at Car and Driver ratings. 
-You want a refined, elegant interior (after upgrades) that doesn’t look like a futuristic Japanese robot. 
-You want a luxury SUV which is less common than an X5 or GLE
-You want to have fun, but you also want a big comfy seat. 
-You want a highly reliable brand. 
-You can afford to pay over $1000 per year in regular maintenance. 

Issues to be aware of:
2019 was the first model year. Early builds have some gremlins. 
Infotainment has occasional bugs, but nothing compared to an X5. 
Breaks can be crunchy or make squealing noise.

porsche,cayenne,2020,Rob, 07/23/2020,Consider Jeep,3,"Although the Porsche is flashy and the name will impress your friends, buy it if that’s your goal. If you want technology, look at the Jeep Grand Cherokee.   Some of the nicer upgrades were stolen from Ford. Items such as the red running stripe across the rear of the car and the kick under the bumper to open the tailgate. Who gives you a remote to open the tailgate but then you can’t close it as well? Answer is Porsche. Porsche needs to copy someone’s speedometer because theirs doesn’t work. I own 2 Porsche models and both require an algorithm to determine the actual speed. Or you can turn on your Waze. So where is the remote start?  Isn’t any. $100000 and no remote start???  They should have copied someone.

porsche,cayenne,2020,2020 Cayenne (Base), 01/02/2021,Definitely one of the best SUVs on the Road,5,"Bought my Cayenne in August of 2020. I have about 5000 miles on it now and it has been wonderful. No issues at all, and the build quality really is fantastic. It handles like a dream and even with the base engine it feels extremely  quick. The transmission  is amazingly fast and responsive. I only which I could go as fast as I want most of the time. I think the complaints about the fingerprints on the high gloss trim are overly dramatic as it is very easy to wipe off. My only complaint is that the start/stop system is very intrusive and you have to disable it each time you start the car.  The apple CarPlay sometime has issues, however Porsche products are superior to other cars I have owned, especially when compared to BMW and Mercedes which have really gone downhill in my opinion. It should be noted that Porsche came in second in terms of luxury car reliability after Lexus.  I may never own another brand of vehicle for the rest of my life.

porsche,macan,2015,Sam Suen, 06/13/2016,Best handling SUV on the market still going strong,5,"It might cost a bit more than the competition but its worth every penny.  My wife thinks it is luxurious and quiet. My kids think its the most comfortable car we owned and my main attraction to the car is its performance and handling.  What kind of black magic is this?!  Porsche tunes their base suspension so well that you will be wasting money on PASM or air suspension.  You won't need it unless you are chasing seconds on a race track.  The S makes plenty power so I wouldn't bother going with the TURBO unless you want to drag race someone all the time.  I would recommend getting at least the BOSE stereo upgrade as the base unit sounds horrible.  I would also recommend getting the sport seat for its superior support and comfort.  If you keep disciplined and not get tempted by all those other options, you can get it at a reasonable price.  I have achieved 29 MPG on the highway at 65 MPH for a 30 minutes stretch.  But it is so much fun getting on the gas and listen to the exhaust pop with the gear change.  The PDK is nothing short of phenomenal.   Your real life mileage will be closer to 20 MPG. Three years in, the car is still a delight. A few recalls have not made any difference to my enjoyment. No unbecoming rattles and shakes. Still have plenty treads on tires and brakes are good for more miles. The Porsche dealers’ pricing for service has gone off the deep end, going from a reasonable $300 for the first service to $1600 for the 30k service. That is basically an oil change and new plugs. Thankfully nothing a local garage cannot handle for a fraction of the cost.  The only dilemma I face is what to replace it with when I sell it.  June 2018 update.  Dealer has learned the errors of its ways.  Whole Service department has be reorganized.  Offering service specials to get its customers back.  Front tires still have 4/32 and rears 6/32.  Will replace after the summer.  Everything still working well.  Still don't see anything in the market which could be a worthwhile replacement.  December 2019 update. Tires replaced September 18 with same brand as they lasted 38k miles,  not bad at all for an SUV.  Brakes replaced ar 40k miles. PDK fluids and filters also changed.  Car has been super reliable.  Everything still works. The market has finally caught up.  Newer models have more technology.  Everyone has made their SUV faster and better.  The last five years has been trouble free with this vehicle.  It handled city highways and winding roads with aplomb.  I could probably drive it for another five without breaking a sweat.  However, my needs have changed and I no longer need an SUV.  The SUV craze gripping the country is making some beloved sedans disappear.  I finally traded the Macan S in for a sports sedan.  Best get one before those are gone.

porsche,macan,2015,Robliski, 10/03/2015,Best of Both Worlds: Sports Car and Space,5,"After owning a Mercedes Benz ML 500 for 6 years, I decided it was time to change. Since we were sort of out of the woods (no more strollers and other junk that the parent of a baby or toddler has to carry around), we were willing to downsize a little bit. We test drove the new ML which was more of the same with a few more bells and whistles and knew that we wanted something different. Something unique. Test drove the Maserati Ghibli and it was very nice but we did not consider buying it; it would have to have been a lease. Considered buying a Porsche Panamera. Test drove the Panamera and I loved the PDK (Porsche Dupple Kupplung; double clutch) transmission. Very smooth, quick, and responsive gear changes. But the Panamera felt like a boat and the standard 6 cylinder did not have enough juice. I read about Macan and began to really research it and decided to take one for a test drive at work and I was sold on the spot. I had just bought a 911 at that time and the Macan felt like a 4 door 911. Took the wife to the dealership for a test drive and she loved it as well. I also test drove the Cayenne. The Cayenne felt more like the ML - felt heavy and wasn't peppy. We ordered the Macan around Holloween and got it March of this year.

After 6 months of ownership I cannot find a single flaw with the car. It is amazing in every way. It is very responsive and agile. It handles really well. The PDK transmission is very smooth and shifts great and has real paddle shifters instead of those terrible buttons. Switch it into sport mode and the transmission shifts are even quicker and the entire responsiveness of the car is even better. I truely feel like this car is a 4 door 911. There is also plenty of space for luggage for those trips to the beach and/or for going out of town. I've heard some complaints about the rear seat knee room, but everything has a price in my opinion and there has to be a compromise somewhere between sportiness and space which in concept are opposing principles.

porsche,macan,2015,Tom, 01/14/2016,Sport Sedan in an SUV Body,5,"I had mixed feelings about buying this car because I had a Lexus RX400h with 105,000 miles on it that was still a perfectly good car. I didn't need a new car, however I was so tired of driving the Lexus. And the difference in driving pleasure of the Porsche vs. Lexus is night and day. The Porsche is an SUV that is actually fun to drive. Great handling and acceleration. And while the Lexus was comfortable, the Porsche feels much more special with higher quality fit and finish. I'm partial to Porsche's based on currently owning a Boxster S and having 911's in the past. The Macan is very bit a Porsche. I also test drove the new Volvo XC90 and BMW X5 before deciding on the Macan S. Both have interiors just as nice as the Macan, and in fact I liked the Volvo interior the best. However neither came close to the driving performance and feel of the Macan S.

An update: my Macan S now has 41,000 miles on it. It has been rock solid reliable, and continues to be a joy to drive. I also never get tired of how good the engine sounds. However this is an expensive car to maintain. Tires, brakes, transmission service, and spark plugs replaced at 40k miles - Several thousand dollars!

Less than a mile from the house, we were hit on the driver side by a PU that was going about 45-50mph.  He never touched his brakes from what I can tell.  My view was block by another vehicle but I did see catch him out of the side of my eye right before impact and was able to swerve a little.  Both side impact bags deployed and surprisingly, no glass was broken.  It spun us in a complete 360.  The vehicle did what it was design to do and there was no intrusion into the passenger cabin however the truck did do a number on the left rear tire and wheel. The only injury was to the occupant in the rear passenger seat suffering 6 fractured ribs from the seat belt, but I'll take that any day.  I haven't inspected the vehicle but I'll bet that it's totaled.  This accident happened so fast that none of the passengers were able to brace.  I  am very pleased with how it did with this impact to the driver's side passenger door albeit not a Tbone.  I understand from the Euro safety test that the Macan got good grades and that was proved up this Sept 5th.  If anyone wants pictures, I have some.

porsche,macan,2015,Bill C., 12/12/2018,"Perfection , but costly",5,"The Macan is great all aspects....almost.   Yes the purchase price is high , but you know that going in. The disappointment has been in routine maintenance costs. Oil Change at dealership is $400.00+, if you shop for a good repair shop you can bring that cost down to about $250.00. The 30K maintenance at that same independent shop was $840.  If you equip it with the optional 20 or 21"" rims the ride suffers and the costs of those tires will exceed a grand and even driving like an old lady , the tires are good for maybe 20 to 25k miles.  Love the car, it just eats too much $$.  I can only imagine what a water pump or some electronic component would cost. Buy it or lease it , But once the warranty is up , I'd advise  moving on.  Did I mention the car is great? It is.

porsche,macan,2015,Michele, 09/13/2016,Forgot I am driving an SUV,5,"The performance and handling are the obvious reasons for why I got the Macan. But now, after 1300 miles, the experience keeps getting better.  Being 4'11"" is always a challenge but the seat and steering wheel easily accomodate me.  And the side mirror doesn't block my view when making left turns - that is not the case in the Audi Q5 which I also considered. I can see all around which was a problem in the BMW X6 which has a rear window that left me with huge blind spots. The best comfort feature is the vented seats.  In a black with black interior, the vented seats cool quickly and keep me cool on hot summer days. The only nit I have is that the Apple Car Play doesnt always turn on when I plug in my iPhone 6. Although it isnt an issue if my husband plugs in his iPhone 6S. I have one warning, it is easy to go very fast and not realize it. 50 feels like 35. 90 feels like 70.  So newbies need to get used to the handling to control themselves...or not!  Took a ride in my friend's Tesla and while the 400hp could do 0-60 in 4 seconds and make. you feel like you sere on a roller coaster, you felt the curves and the car feels looser. My Macan is much better and hugs the curves for better control.     ----having trouble adding in the purchase date so adding it hear: August 2016 bought a 2017.

It was what I was looking for in the way of  sportiness and practicality after having a Mercedes CLS that couldn't handle the bad roads of Houston. In sport mode it is engaging and quick but in traffic I just drive in comfort mode. Perfect size and easy to park.   Only problem so far is my Sat radio function stopped working after 4 days and I have been waiting over 2 months for a replacement. Pretty disappointed that Porsche has not fixed this yet but hopefully soon.

porsche,macan,2015,Chris, 08/29/2018,Porsche Macan is a Beast,5,"I have had the Macau Turbo for 7 months. I owned a Porsche Cayenne for two years and enjoyed it but wanted something with a better balance of power, quickness and supreme handling without giving up sitting up off the road like an SUV offers.  The Macan provides the best driving experience of any car I have ever owned.  The 3.6 L turbo and the standard adaptive suspension make the ride like no other SUV and many 2-door sports cars can’t touch.  The 0-60 in ~4.2 seconds and the ability to masterfully handle curves at higher speeds than you can imagine possible makes every drive an experience.  Beautiful styling in both the interior and exterior.  Porsche has built an amazing high performance vehicle in the Macan Turbo.  The sports plus feature takes the performance to another level.

porsche,macan,2015,gtfranklin, 08/13/2014,My 22nd new vehicle,5,"My Macan S is by far the most enjoyable new car in my long car-buying history. I have purchased Ford, Olds, Nissan, Toyotas, Honda, Acuras, Infiniti, BMWs, but not since my '98 E36 M3 have I been so thoroughly impressed with a car. Great handling PLUS great ride, solid, quiet (almost too quiet), fast, plus much better mpg than I expected (23.8 @ 2600 miles)...I make up excuses to go places just to drive this car. Didn't rate reliability because it's new & my 1st Porsche. Came from '08 and '10 MDX, & was going to try X-3 35i until the Macan info came out in January. Picked mine up in May.
8/16 Update:
Still love this car at 2+ years and 27K miles. 100% trouble-free (only few software updates). Got over 25mpg on recent road trip. Still solid and rattle-free. Only ""negatives"" would be reg maintenance cost (i.g. oil changes) overpriced. And the sun visors could be a little larger.

Update:
At 40 months, still my favorite new purchase. Had 2 recalls handled with a morning visit, but zero problems to date. Still drives like new. Great exhaust sound.  Usually get ""new car bug"" at 3 years. Recent test drives of new competition leave me unimpressed (except for new Panamera 4S which is out of my $ range). I check trade-in value every year (avg. of KBB, Black book, Edmunds, NADA), and residuals are extremely high. $about $14.5K depreciation for 36 mos, 35K miles. Outstanding.
2/19 Update:
54K Miles, still drives like new. I rarely keep cars this long, but this Macan has delayed the new car bug from attacking. Actually had to buy new tires last month. Replaced Michelin Latitudes with Michelin Pilot A/S 3+...really like these new tires. Only problem to date was exhaust bracket repair under warrantee.

How fast is this vehicle you ask, all you need to know is you can pull out in front of most anyone except another Porsche.  You need to worry about rear ending the vehicle ahead of you.

porsche,macan,2016,GK, 09/16/2018,"Its a Porsche, and worthy of the name",3,"Fantastic acceleration, incredible handling and a taut ride.  This is a fast sports car with a hatch.   I have always loved a hatchback, allows easy access, and makes the usually useless backseat into a utility vehicle.  This car does everything well, has a million well-thought out features, and is a rocket on the road.  It corners without slowing down, and handles like nothing I've ever driven.  It ain't cheap, but I purchased a 2016 S with lots of features that someone else paid for, and it only had 13k miles on it.  You can't tell the difference between it and a 2018, and I paid under 50K.  Its like a brand new car.  But beware, I lost the transfer case, which is chronic on this vehicle, but the $7000. repair was covered under the warranty, and now it drives like new.  They replaced it in 3 days without a penny out of pocket.  But I was told this happens rather often, but a lot more so with the Cayenne.  The one thing about Porsche you never hear is that they are second only to Lexus in reliability, and are tops in resale for SUVs.  The most fun car you will ever drive !!
UPDATE:  The power and acceleration can be dampened by having multiple people in the car.  Just someone in the passenger seat is enough to feel the difference with a 340 HP engine.  And after owning this car for 18 months and having replaced 2 transfer cases @ $7,000 each (covered under warranty) and seeing my resale value drop $20,000 the first year, I'd have to say that value is questionable.  Does it blow away other SUV's on paper ?  Definitely yes, but $2,200. to replace 2 sets of brakes after just 27,000 miles and $350. oil changes can make your wallet feel the pinch, and it also begs the question, now that the warranty is up, what's next ?  A fantastic car that is rather expensive to operate as a daily driver.  Losing 40% of the resale value in a single year on a used car is shocking.  The driving dynamics and the joy of driving it will be very hard to replace, but this isn't Lexus reliability or resale.  I had my LS 430 for 10 years, and basically only changed the oil & tires.  And the resale value didn't drop $15,000 in 10 years.  It simply changes the game when the specter of large repair bills is in the mix.

porsche,macan,2016,Inka, 06/01/2016,Buy One Buy Two,5,"I drive a Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT8....470 hp Hemi a blast to drive.....right up until I bought my wife a Macan S. I trimmed it out to my liking so suffice it to say it's a bad azz all around vehicle. The power is plenty, the handling is insane and I love the look of this car....Agate gray with black wheels. 

When I have a choice to take a car out it is now always the Macan.....always. The Jeep is 4 years old now and guess what I did? I ordered a Macan Turbo for me. 120 more days and I'll have no more envy issues. I looked at the GLE 63S and other bigger Performance SUV's but afer a year of looking I was afraid whatever I Bought wouldn't equal the Macan. Why fight it?

If I hear one more time the Macan is the baby brother to the Cayenne I'm gonna lose it. The Cayenne to the Macan is like a Cessna to a Gulfstream. Please.

porsche,macan,2016,David, 08/02/2017,One of the best SUV's on the market,5,"This is one of the best SUV's you can buy at the 52-55K price point. Performance wise, it feels like you driving an larger sports car. Acceleration is on point, and handling is very tight for a car this size. When you hit the brakes you feel it.  Aesthetically the outside of the car is beautiful, with curves and design that make it look very elegant and sporty. It looks like a traditional Porsche. Personally I'm not a fan of the interior, the cockpit layout of the buttons is too much for me and makes it feel like your in a 747. Also not a fan of the navigation system, but if Porsche is able to incorporate the new nav systems they have for the 718 for newer editions then that problem is solved.  Overall great car, would take this over a BMW X4 any day.

Cons: the infotainment system looks pretty old though when compared to Audi/BMW. Expensive options which adds significant cost to the final price. Mileage is not great(340hp V6 engine). Rear seats leg room is not super great.

porsche,macan,2016,mark, 08/13/2017,Just over 32k miles... in twenty months.,5,"This is the long term review. From day one this car has been a pleasure to drive, my 997 spends most of its time resting in the garage. Also in the stable (kids & dog car) are a BMW X5 and two BMW X3's. The Porsche is a sports car with a hatch that you can drive comfortably for eight hours without fatigue... the BMW's are older, well made and are not as fast or handle as well. The M series may be different. The Porsche excels with handling speed and comfort. The car has been in for service due to brake booster issues (vacuum leak) at 30k miles and routine maintenance. Tire wear has been surprisingly little... I owned a Cayenne that ate tires, so having great Michelin tires that look and drive new with 32k miles on them is a bonus. I fully expect to drive this car well over the 100k mark just like the BMW's... oil changes every 7500 and enjoy a wet golden retriever and a surfboard in the back...

porsche,macan,2016,Elena, 12/09/2015,"Smooth ride, excellent performance, maneuverable!",5,"Perfect in its niche of a compact SUV/crossover: luxurious, spacious, powerful, comfortable, maneuverable. Ideal for those who love style, and do not want to drive what everyone else is driving. Ideal for those who do not like/need sedans or low profile sports cars, but are not ready to settle for a huge SUV. That's when Macan comes in place! Compact SUV is exactly what it is, but add here 340 hp (for base model Macan S), smooth ride, amazing maneuverability, interior comfort and at least two packages - and you will enjoy it without paying $100,000. Almost 1.5 times less! A little problem is that people do mistake it for a $100,000 car, which is flattering but not needed.

porsche,macan,2016,CQH, 04/01/2016,Bribed wife to swap with my car,5,"We traded my wife's Cayenne Diesel for Macan S as our kids are older now and our youngest will now drive in a year.  I loved driving it so much that I bribed her to take my 2014 BMW 535iX mSport and a promise that she can pick a luxury sedan when the BMW's lease comes up in 5 months. 

The Macan S is now my daily driver into Manhattan and it's a pleasure to drive. It's pretty comfortable, extremely tight and fun to drive. I got the White Ash interior package which is very unique and extremely high-end looking. Just feels like a million bucks when driving. The only knock on it is the base stereo is not very good (I overlooked it because I liked the White Ash interior so much and didn't want to wait 3 months).

porsche,macan,2016,Moosedoc, 07/03/2016,Practical Porsche,5,"Owning a Porsche generally means giving up on some degree of practicality in terms of having a car that is a ""daily driver"". The Macan lets those of us with kids still in car seats have the opportunity to enjoy Porsche's legendary performance in a vehicle that is at home at the mall as it is on the track. The highest levels of performance come on the GTS model, but the ""S"" model offers plenty of acceleration and more capability than most drivers will ever exploit. The 18 way power seats are phenomenal and a worthwhile upgrade. The ""premium plus"" option includes keyless entry and ignition as well an upgraded sound system and ventilated/ heated seats. The 2017 model year has an upgraded touch screen navigation that is better than previous models, but not nearly as user friendly as some of the competitions. The packages will easily turn this $54,000 car into $70-90,000 car, but nobody walks into this purchase expecting a great value.

porsche,macan,2017,Pinehurst John, 06/12/2016,Macan S update 2017 vs 2019 Macan S,5,"after driving bmw's for the last 25 years, decided to try a Macan S. What a great decision I made....smile.......... Powerful and my Macan S 2017 is a sports car acting machine outdoing most of the bmw's I have owned..........with the exception of my 3 series M convertible. It is a truly great combination of practicality and driving excitement. This is a Porsche, no doubt about it, from the sound of the engine to going around 35mph corners at 60...........its a Porsche! The ride and noise in the cabin are muted and comfortable, bumps are a little harsh, but the other attributes of the vehicle are well worth the small aggravation of the semi stiff ride. After all this is not a Lexus RX. Cabin is done very well with great materials and is big enough for me, 6'3"", 260lbs. I am not sure what I would do to improve this vehicle, not anything I can come up with right now. 5 stars for sure...........................yippee!!!! UPDATE: 6mo owning the vehicle, 7000 miles. double down on all statements previous. nothing about the vehicle that I can complain about. it is really a blast to drive, so much in fact I find myself taking the long way to almost everywhere I go and going for joyrides very often. I have not had my first ticket yet as I am a careful driver, but the car is so responsive it is hard to drive the speed limits. Whatever speed you are going seems to slow. Get one or test drive one, until you do, you can not possibly know what I know. It is driving heaven. UPDATE, one year later.......... all review items remain at same high levels. I find myself driving places I don't need to go just to be driving. This is truly a great vehicle and it seems priced correctly for the quality and image that you get driving a Porsche. I am very pleased with this vehicle and it will be hard to drive anything else after this experience. update: 18 months owned, 18k miles. no further comments, all of my previous comments stand as written. Great Vehicle. Update, 23k miles. No change, 5+ stars! Yippee!! UPdate, 29k miles, vehicle still meeting all previous comments. I have owned a lot of top end sedans, sports cars and SUV's, this one tops the SUV list by a mile, my X5 was great, but no match for this vehicle. YIPPEE!!  32K miles now June 2019, nothing to add except the transfer case needed to be repaired. Dealer did it under warranty and vehicle is good to go. Thinking of a new one as soon as I get to 40k, next year probably. / Update Nov 2019. Traded in the 2017 Macan S for a 2019 Macan S. I like the Macan 2019 better for one reason, the transmission set up is much better. The 2017 shifted into the higher gears more readily and the 2019 does not. It is slightly a more aggressive engine-transmission set up without having to go to sport mode. The 2019 has increased horse power from the 2017, but you can hardly notice it, they both over perform in acceleration and handling abilities. The 2019 feels a bit heavier, but that is ok with me, it makes the bumps in the road a little less noticeable, this is an SUV not a track vehicle. Heavier or not, it goes through turns and is as sway resistant as the 2017, maybe better. The 2017 steering had a lighter feel and slightly more feedback when driving. The enlarged 2019 Nav screen is a big plus, the 2017 screen was to small. For some reason Porsche quit putting decorative roof rails on the car unless you order the car direct from the factory. Cost cutting??? You can not add the rails after market at the dealership. The vehicle looks better with the rails. Big bummer. Porsche has a winner with the Macan and they have not done much to change it from 2017, rear tail lights, no roof rails, and the bigger Nav screen seem to be the biggies. Some small aesthetic changes to the grill. It is still far and away the best in its class and worth the extra $ it commands. Update/Dec 2020, Macan S 2019, nothing new, excellent
 vehicle worth the extra $ over Audi, BMW, MB................. One very small nit picking complaint, the passengers side column between the front passenger seat and rear seat is thick, probably something to do with safety/overturn, but you can not see a small car where the column is if you look exactly at the right time. Need to look twice to be sure no car is there. It is a small blind spot, but a blind spot never the less. Otherwise, the vehicle is just about perfect.

porsche,macan,2017,Gus, 06/22/2018,Bought it for Performance,5,"Have a 2016 Macan S with over 40,000 miles.  Not one problem so far.  Service can be expensive but most service instructions are on the internet : ie, how to change air filters and plugs.  Local dealer is excellent.   Competition may provide more electronics and other things, but i purchased a Porsche simply for performance and i have not been disappointed.

Now have 57,000 miles and still surprised with the cars performance and drivability.  Have had no problems with the car.  Service can be expensive particularly if you leave everything to the dealer.  You can save money from performing simple service such as changing filters and plugs.

Always get looks from people!!!

I bought this vehicle as a present for myself after finishing my last Chemo treatment...  I've owned Porsche's for over forty years, numerous types including, 911's, 996's, 997's, boxster s, Cayenne and even a 914 in my younger days. The Macan is by far the best balanced SUV-sports car for the money you can find. Mine is not highly optioned. The engine is responsive in all ranges, the braking smooth and intuitive and the handling sublime;  that's without any of the pricey suspension options. The base stereo is just fine and I consider myself an audiophile, the added sunroof and lane change assist were my add's along with the premium package.... $59.6k. The Macan has been a pleasure on long drives down the Big Sur coast or through the high Sierras... and the base seats are a lot more comfortable than my 997.  The one thing you have to be careful about is the quickness of this car to go from 70 to 95 in a heart beat... its that fast.

The dealer also was very stubborn on taking anything off the MSRP. Would I repeat this purchase? Probably not, you can save a few bucks buying the maintenance contract ahead which they didn't even offer me.

porsche,macan,2017,P. Mason, 08/18/2017,retired ole goat !,5,"Reaching our late 60's, my wife and I have had Blazers, Tahoe, BMW X-5, Mercedes ML series.  We needed a somewhat smaller SUV but still haul grandkids, dogs, groceries, hardware around.   The Macan S had all the accessories that we needed and wanted.  The vision 360 degrees is great.  Comfort is fantastic.  Performance is perfect, this ole goat can run with any of them!  The Macan is easy to maneuver and park.  I took a close friend for a ride and he was astounded at the interior design and room! If you are considering updating an SUV and don't take a look at the Macan, you are cheating yourself.

porsche,macan,2017,Wallace Ip, 07/15/2018,this is the one to get,5,"Over the last 15 years I've had an X5 and two X3's, all brilliant SUVs in their own right, but this one is in a class all by itself. The drive and handling are typical Porsche; the more and the harder you drive it, the more confidence it instills. It's simply unflappable. It doesn't handling quite at the level of a 911 or a Boxster, but no other SUV even comes close, the aforementioned bimmers included. It even gets better mileage than either the X5 or the X3's. The Macan's styling is superb, and although it is built on the same platform as the Audi Q5, compared side-by-side it makes the Q5 look like a soap box. Admittedly the Macan S runs a few grands higher than all the other mentioned vehicles, but don't let that deter you from a test drive. It might just change your mind. It did mine.

January 2019 - have had the car for almost 8 months now and still think it's the small SUV/crossover to get. Unflappable handling through rain, sleet, snow and everything in between. Fit and finish are also outstanding. I have two 55 lb dogs who ride in the backseat frequently and the Macan more than holds its own. Changes made to the 2019 model are minimal and mostly cosmetic. Will hold on to mine for a while!

July 2019 - still have not changed my mind a bit...this is an awesome vehicle.  Supremely dependable and fun to drive.

January 2020 - this is a keeper for sure. Awesome handling, plenty of power, best-sounding exhaust on the planet!

porsche,macan,2017,Ursula, 11/21/2017,Its a Beautiful Car,4,"I really wanted this Porsche and we traded my BMW X5 for it and my hubby's 911, however, now I don't want to take it many places because it was so darned expensive that I just want it to sit in the garage! lol  I miss the shoulder and open room of my X5 and some other little features that you don't realize you enjoyed until they were gone. Soft close doors, heads up display, just the roomy feel in general.  I love, love, love the Macan, however, being in my 50's now and not in my 20's, I enjoy the ease of getting in a vehicle as well as getting out, and that is very tight in this beauty.  However, once you're in, it fits like a glove and rides like a dream.  I'm torn with keeping her or getting the new Audi SQ5 or the Volvo XC-60 R Design.  I'm truly a car person and giving up that Porsche for one of those is definitely going to feel like going a few steps down.  I'm torn I tell you!!

porsche,macan,2017,Pat, 07/29/2017,2 months in and still love it!!,5,"I came out of a newer BMW convertible.  Loved that car but needed something with just a bit more practicality.  I looked at these on a whim and fell in love with the styling both inside and out.  As soon as my wife sat in it she said....I want this car.   Opted for the base with the premium plus package and 20"" wheels plus a couple other options.  Bought it for $52k net.   I feel that it's actually a great value for what you get and there isn't another compact crossover that can touch it in the driving dynamics department.  Handles like a 911.  Average mid 20s on the highway on premium fuel.  No complaints so far.  The back seat could be a bit bigger,  but it suits my 12 year old just fine.

porsche,macan,2017,Angie DB Southlake, TX,First Porsche Macan S- IN LOVE! True even 3 yrs,5,"This is my first SUV; previous owner of Audi A5 and a few BMW 3-series cars.  Wanted something sporty but higher off the ground.  Really happy thus far with purchase.  In addition, I purchased tire warranty and 5-year maintenance warranty.  It is peace of mind for me.  Interesting enough, I saw a nail in my tire just today so the warranty will come in handy inside of my first month of ownership.

Updating after 3 years.   Love the driving experience and overall layout of the Macan S!
"
porsche,macan,2017,BenE, 12/02/2016,Great driver but poor technology,3,"Moved up from Audi S6 to Macan S.   Great driver very good acceleration, handling and braking.   However it's at least 5 years behind Audi for technology.   Actually discovered after picking up the vehicle - has no voice control.  Apple car play requires phone to be ard wired to special plug. Very little control over car features.   If you want a great driving SUV this is top of the list - but be warned a Chevy Cruze actually is more technical advanced for connectivity.

porsche,macan,2017,Eric Zhuang, 01/16/2019,"Bought it for the look, surprise on performance",5,"I love Porsche exterior design. I mean, who doesnt? When I was doing compact SUV shopping, one other factor was headroom for driver seat. I am 6'2'' and most compact SUV does not fit me well since I love driving while sitting upright. You will be surprised how much headroom you get from this seemingly small vehicle! To get this look I want, I am sacrificing cargo space. But I just picked a full size bed frame (in boxes) using this car no problem! Driving it is fun as everyone has talked about even mine is just the base model. Turning radius surprised my colleagues who rode a few times. I have only driven it for 4k miles so maintenance cost and everything is still unknown to me. We will see.

porsche,macan,2017,Gabriel, 01/01/2018,Bad lease disappointing experience with Macan.,2,"3 years of lease with this Macan. Hopefully this is ending in february od 2018 and we can rid of it ! Lot of problems , too often in the car dealer . We had problems with steering wheel and transmition once, have several issues with brakes noises,  problems with stero/radio not working properly.... That it was not expecting when choosing a Porsche.   Even though when big issues happened we didnt have any support from Atlanta headquarters and Miami dealer.  A deep disapointment overall.  Two friends of mine (company' peers) have had Macan and they are cancelling lease too, so I guess it is not a good bet . You are warned by three diferent clients!.

porsche,macan,2017,Lucio, 05/19/2018,Not safe to own. Curtain airbags did not deploy.,2,"We were T-boned in an intersection spinning our car sideways towards where the other car is coming from. The curtain airbags did not deploy. The passenger door where my 10 year old daughter was sitting twisted that both doors on the right side cannot be opened.Porsche claimed that it has to be at a certain speed and angle for it to deploy. Seriously? It would have been a different story if we were injured. Luckily, we were ok. What is sad is porsche stated that there is no need for further investigation since the technician claimed that it did not meet the threshold. Well how do I know if the sensors are working ok if they dont test it? If you care for safety, I don’t recommend porsche cars. I believe its better and safer to drive asian luxury cars for the price you pay.

porsche,macan,2017,Roman, 12/31/2016,Porsche misses big,2,"This car is full of mechanical problems.  To include leaking fuel line, and exhaust brackets that easily brake causing horrendous noise.  Well below even average quality.  The roadside (yes you will need it!!) service is poor.  The ""concierge"" service is a joke.  They will tell you where you can go rent a car and they might pay for it after your $90,000 crappy car breaks down for the second time in 20k miles.  Porsche has become a watered down brand with poor quality and even worse service! AVOID!!

porsche,macan,2017,Roger Peng, 07/21/2017,Nothing spectacular,3,"I should start off by saying I am a Cayenne owner who got the chance to drive the Macan S as a loaner car for 4 days. I was generally quite disappointed. I've driven many kinds of cars, and the Macan simply does not stand out. I'm surprised by the overwhelmingly positive reviews, as the car does not live up to it. It is a rather average ride dressed up with a somewhat fancy interior that isn't particularly spacious or functional. Porsche has a way of making cars that are large on the outside and small on the inside (this complaint applies to the Cayenne as well). The rows of buttons in the center console is getting old, and the entertainment console is a joke compared to what you'd find in a Tesla. The exhaust note is a gimmick aimed at impressing new-to-Porsche owners, as the car is not particularly fast. A small capacity engine aided by turbo charger just doesn't cut it. After you spend some time with the car, you really start to feel like ""Hey, this drives like any other car!"". After my short stint with the Macan, I couldn't be happier to return the loaner.
"

porsche,macan,2017,George Posada, 07/10/2017,Pretty darn fast,5,"I have owned BMWs for over 40 years. This Macan GTS is my first Porsche and it is great. It needs two things 1) to be available in a manual transmission (I know I can't shift as well as this transimission but It's more fun) and 2) to have a day time backlit tach when the lights are off (even paddle shifting needs a visible tach). I offered to buy a second Macan for my wife, but she won't give up her Mini because she loves a manual transimission too. I still have my BMW stick, as well. Our left feet are so bored with no clutch to operate. Having said all that, the Macan is still kick to drive. Love the way it sounds in Sport and Sport + mode.

porsche,macan,2017,Ronnie G , 12/19/2020,Yes and No,3,"The style is tops and so is the drive. As far as handling Mercedes and BMW does a better job .

porsche,macan,2018,Gus, 12/22/2018,"50,000 Miles",4,"After over 50,000 miles with no issues other than 10,000 miles services this is the best vehicle we have owned. Prior vehicles include Audi A7, Cayenne, Q5, Boxster S, MB SL 550.  Yes, service costs can be high but most ordinary maintenance is in YouTube.  I did the complete 40,000 mile service in the garage at a cost of about $500 vs dealer cost of $1,600.  This is an excellent highway car which can cruise all day at 80+  MPH.  In the city it leaves most in the rear view mirror.  In summary, the car is a daily driver which delivers great fun like no other SUV.  One caution...options can be very expensive, so beware!
"
porsche,macan,2018,Steve Morley, 09/04/2018,Great SUV but it’s not perfect,4,"The good:Great performance, good handling and very comfortable. The 18 way adjustable seats are excellent. Interior leather overall is high quality. Heated and cooled seats work great. Very low road noise and excellent sound system (I have the premium audio option). The interactive cruise control is a great option. Of course it looks great!

The bad: The infotainment interface is poor. Just getting it registered with Porsche is a major headache. The navigation system data entry is useless. It seems the database is not fully updated. Difficult to find addresses and forget searching by point of interest. My 2011 BMW X5 was much better. No real time traffic information even thought it’s supposed to have this feature.

The control switches for the info system are more VW than Porsche. Does not feel like it’s high quality.

Air con is working OK but does not seem as powerful (cool down) as other cars I have owned. Just about good enough.

The ugly: The layout of the switches and in the centre consul is confusing. Forget the buttons in the overhead consul while driving. Just can’t see them. 

The garage opener is hard to program. I managed to get it working but the instructions are poor. The dealer also tried but it did not work first time.

The external temperature sensor is never accurate. Porsche say it’s something to do with the sensor location and you need to drive at least three miles for it to read properly. Never had a car like that!

The parking system is very limited. Just a rear camera and audible sensors front and rear. No 360 degree camera. 

Last but not least the service cost. First service is just an oil change $800!. 2nd service (20,000) is an oil change and some filters $1,200. In three years normal service >$2,400. Since the motor is same as Audi and VW this is just over charging. I got my services included free of charge in the lease.

Apple car play is included in the connect services. So to keep it after the first year it will cost $400 per year. Unfortunately more Porsche greed. 

Do I like the car. No. I love it. Best SUV from a drivers view point and it looks fantastic."
porsche,macan,2018,Patrick, 03/30/2018,Macan drives like the Cayman with more room,5,"This car is very quiet, has excellent acceleration and handles like the Cayman (which I also own). This car replaced a 2017 Mercedes GL250 which I regret purchasing. Front seat comfort is exceptionally comfortable even for my 6’7” neighbor that went for a test drive (however, you wouldn’t want to be sitting in the rear seat behind him).

Update 9-30-18: I now have more than 13,000 miles on the Macan, which is primarily used for business. I have not had any issues with the car whatsoever. Even though it’s the base model, the acceleration on the highway for passing is still impressive. Throttle response and grip from a standing start is excellent compliments in part to the all wheel drive. In contrast, the Mercedes GLA 250 was downright annoying; it required careful pressure on the throttle to avoid spinning the front tires and once in motion, the throttle steer was terrible. Porsche exceptional engineering eliminates these annoying factors.

 July of this year we took one of the grandkids with us on a road trip to the smoky mountains in North Carolina for a wedding. The car had plenty of room even with the plug in refrigerator in the back. Handling on the mountain roads, with a somewhat heavier load than normal, was superb. The 12 hour drive was very comfortable. We both love the seats and interior design.

The lane change assist eliminates the blind spot and makes driving much safer and easier. The lane keep assist is something we both could live without, but when active, it’s a rather subtle sound so we’ve just learned to keep it on. 

I’ve had a few clients mention that “business must be good” when I arrive in the Porsche. My response is usually “don’t let the badge fool you, it’s cheaper than some pick up trucks.”

Service: The 10k mile service at Champion Porsche is a pleasure and a striking difference from Pompano Beach Mercedes dealer across the street, which is terrible ( even the service manager doesn’t return calls).

What I don’t like- I bought the factory roof racks (which I only install if I need to haul large items) and although they are easy to install and remove, they add considerable wind noise.

Update April 1st 2019: The car now has more than 25,000 miles after 13 months. The enjoyment continues. My wife and I both love the handling and comfort of this car. In fact in February, we went to the Porsche 48 hours club race in Sebring; and instead of entering out Cayman in the autocross, we decided to run the Macan. 

Our goal was simple. We just  wanted to see how well the car handled driving fast in a safe autocross environment. Again the Macan surprised both of us with its exceptional handling. At the end of the day we won first place in men’s and ladies stock class. And we drove faster than some 911’s, Caymans and  too!

The 20K mile service was about $1200.00 or so, which we expected, but could surprise a first time Porsche owner. That included all of the factory recommended service including windshield wipers. The tire wear is very good with no unusual wear.

What we don’t like- the rear window and lift gate seems to collect more dust and dirt than other cars. The lift gate can sometimes be finicky when closing with the push buttons (one button closes the gate without locking and the other closes and locks the car). We learned the hard way to watch and make sure it closes all the way before driving away.

Update 4-2-20 I now have about 44,650 miles on the Macan. No mechanical issues whatsoever. 

I did notice however after the 40k mile service the PDK transmission shifted smoother (they changed the transmission fluid) 

I had to install two new rear tires as a result of nails and I’m on the third windscreen. Road debris (I’m on the interstate highways often) caused cracks. 

I still love this little SUV.

Update 10-2-20. The Macan is still performing flawlessly. One thing that needs to be improved is the gas
 fill drain. It’s gets clogged easily and will retain water. It’s very easy to check and clean however.

porsche,macan,2018,Dave, 05/01/2018,You get what you pay for,5,"OK, other SUVs get slightly better gas mileage and a bit more cargo space. But, no SUV can touch the Macan S in drivability. It's very fast. Never any lean or lag. Great smooth ride, not bouncy. The steering is just right in effort and road hold and feedback. Braking is strong. Love the dry sump oil pumps that make the car quieter and accelerate better. Two turbos for extra torque and agility. I tested all the luxury SUVs and the Macan S immediately stood out.

Once the twin turbos spin up, look out. You can accelerate fom 70 to 110 in a few heartbeats. Handling is as I hoped it would be. All in all a great car.

The Macan is a sports car with a hatch, its not really a family car but can easily handle a girlfriend (if she's low maintenance) and a couple of 70lb pups.  The interior is top notch, the base hi-fi is just fine, bluetooth and music (IPOD) connectivity are flawless. Seats (Porsche can rip you off here) need to be the middle package (Premium package) and stick with 19 tires... the 20's may look cool but wear faster and frankly just add to the cost IMO. I chose the sunroof and rails too... The ride: The car handles like a well behaved sports car (I also have a 997 C2S and 996 GT3) and can get you in trouble when going from 70 to 100 in a flash... its effortless.  I also have an X5 and two X3's in the stable (kids and dog/beach mobile)... they're great trucks... the Macan ain't that.  I'll buy again when this hits 150k and I give it to my daughter...

Winding 2 lane roads thru the redwoods were as much fun as long, flat, ‘see for 50 miles in all directions’, desert roads. The vehicle is a blast to drive. Average speed was 70 MPH. The biggest problem was keeping the speed below 110 while passing 18 wheelers - it quickly accumulates speed. Fuel mileage averaged 22 MPG for the trip. The Macan replaced a Cayenne S with 120,000 miles. While the Macan has a much smaller storage capacity, it is 100% more fun to drive. The fit and finish of the vehicle is of the highest quality.

The ride of the car in Wisconsin is very rough and quite noisy, as the road imperfections are transferred sharply through the suspension. Not very forgiving and very sport car like.

porsche,macan,2018,William Mc Keever, 11/23/2020,2018 Macan S,5,"This wonderful little SUV is really a Porsche sports car just a little bit higher off the ground. It handles and drives and behaves like a sports car on the canyon roads and mountain passes, yet will provide security and comfort on freeways and long distant drives. The S package is probably the best value for most drivers, giving you most of the important features and engines available in the model without the additional bells and whistles found in the GTS and Turbo models. These additional features can easily add $25k with Porsche pricing. At resale I believe the S model will retain more relative value.
The driving experience in the Macan S is superb and everyone should try the Porsche driving experience at least once in their life. Acceleration and braking are incredible as is the secure feel and surround of this car. If you wish to carry tall adults in the rear I might suggest the Cayenne where leg room and head room is better. Otherwise I cannot fault this model. I hope to have many years of use from this German gem

porsche,macan,2018,Erik S., 01/04/2021,Love my Macan S!!,5,"I came from a bunch of trucks and before that several performance suvs. Including an Explorer Sport, Edge ST, Jeep SRT, and an X5 45i. This vehicle completely triumphs them all. It has everything you could want and need. I have AWD for Northern Winters, Heated and cooled seats, premium soft and smooth leather, apple CarPlay, Bose Sound, sport exhaust, spider wheels, 18 way power and memory seats. This is one very well equipped Porsche,

I love this, everyone else builds performance vehicles that they modify out of base versions. Porsche just builds Porsches. It handles every bit as well as my buddy's 911 (he's test driven it and verified) it's quiet and comfy. My girlfriend is in love with it and prefers to ride in it vs her S5. 

This machine is SO capable, I can drive it at 130mph and it's just as stable and planted as many sports cars. 

I got mine CPO, which I would definitely recommend because the price can get very steep. But, the CPO warranty is amazing! It's 2 years and unlimited miles on top of whatever warranty is left. I've had zero issues and it's as reliable as any lexus on the road. Such a cool decision! I'm so happy I bought one.

porsche,macan,2019,Jdot, 11/23/2019,Fantastic car! Drives like a dream!,5,"  I am in love with my new car. I have been a Lexus buyer for 20 years and was afraid to switch. Lexus has always met every issue with professionalism.So far, I am loving the car. We will see how the Porsche dealers pan out.
The Lexus dealer has a much better service area while you are waiting with food, massage 
chairs and drinks. Porsche could improve on that.
We will see how the car holds up. All in all I am very happy with the purchase.

porsche,macan,2019,DJW, 10/28/2019,Magnificent Vehicle,5,"2020 Macan S review:
Options are expensive, but you do get what you pay for in quality of materials and In the absolutely joy driving this vehicle. I have owned many vehicle in my lifetime but none have given me as much driving pleasure. Reliability has yet to be determined, it’s only been a few weeks. I have very few complaints, the only one worth mentioning is the lack of daytime visibility when reading the numbers on the analog tach. The S model tachometer comes with a grey rather than black dial, which provides poor contrast with the white numbers on the tach, once the backlightIng has switched off. The red tach needle remains visible. I find myself turning the lights back on during sunny days especially during early mornings when the sun is low.

porsche,macan,2019,Ktlyn23, 10/22/2019,Great vehicle!,4,"I had a loaded Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit before I traded. I hopped into the Macan and just really loved the feel. It handles well, and drives very nice. I actually liked my Jeep a lot, but was looking for a change. Sure there is additional expense associated to such a vehicle, but it is well worth it! I look forward to driving each day! Only downfall is that there is no remote start as an option. I usually forgot to use it on the Jeep so it wasn’t a breaker for me.

porsche,macan,2019,Ed, 08/30/2020,Porsche Macan S is practical and fun daily driver,5,"I purchased my 2019 Porsche Macan S volcanic gray SUV as my ""retirement phase"" daily driver; although I miss the 2016 Cayman I traded for it, I have found the Macan is every bit a fun and exciting car to drive, both in relaxing cruise, as well as pushing through sharp curves going up or down mountain country roads. The fit and finish is premium, the onboard equipment is easy to enable and adjust; the seats are firm but very comfortable. And the turbo-charged V6 is reasonable economical on long interstate highway runs - I averaged 26 mpg during two 400-mile legs at high speed between my home and Savannah, GA during the recent Independence Day holiday. The cargo bay has plenty of space for the occasional shopping trip or overnight/weekend travel. I am very pleased with my choice; I recommend the vehicle. 
"
porsche,macan,2019,Big John AKA Walter, 03/10/2020,My Second Macan,5,"2019 Macan S. Driving is a sort of art form as far as I am concerned, so it is mandatory that I search the entire SUV marketplace for the best. I believe I have found it in the Macan S. The driving experience of the vehicle is superior to all so called competitors. I drove them all to include MB, BMW, Audi, Jag............ Porsche has done a good job of taking quality materials inside for an elegant but simple layout. The tech part of the vehicle takes a little getting used to but simple to use after a little time. My S has excellent straight line acceleration with a very very small turbo lag. It goes around corners at speed with almost zero body roll making taking corners very comfortable. The ride is taught, but pleasant. Some steering feedback, but not a lot. I have a 911 as my other car so my field of interpretation is somewhat different than people who drive other cars I suspect. This vehicle is a solid 5 star, go drive one, I think you will agree. UPDATE, had the vehicle for 10months now, still very pleased. 7500 miles and no problems. This is a better refined overall vehicle than my 2017 Macan S, they have improved the rmp ratios for comfort driving over the old model. This 2019 Macan S stays in the lower gears a little longer making accelerating a little more aggressive and has eliminated the tendency for the vehicle to shift into higher gears at slower speeds. This vehicle is also able to default the auto engine stop to off, you do not need to reset it every time you start the engine like you do in a lot of other vehicles. Still 5 stars across the board.............

porsche,macan,2020,DJ, 11/08/2019,My 2020 Macan S,5,"It’s definitely worth the extra money if performance, handling, and quality of assembly matters. It’s an absolute pleasure to sit in and drive, surrounded by a expertly engineered and configured cockpit of gauges, physical switches and knobs.The new high resolution 10.2” touch screen is responsive and intuitive to use, and comes with a complement of physical buttons as well. Surprisingly, the Model S 3.0 L V6 is more fuel efficient than I expected. Yes, how you drive will affect mileage greatly. However, it’s fairly easy to get about 25 mpg driving at a steady 70-75. The engine exhaust note is rather muted, I regret not getting the sport exhaust. The premium plus package is a great choice and a good starting point. If you choose the 20/21 inch wheels either get the PASM or air suspension. I have 19 inch wheels and the standard steel springs are just fine."
porsche,macan,2020,MAPC, 08/30/2020,DOUBLED DOWN! Upgraded from Base to GTS,5,"First- this review is NOT to say that the Base isn't a great car--IT IS. I owned my 2018 for two years and LOVED it. I have owned many cars and have only 2 other times ever bought another version of a car I had already owned- and this is the first time that I am doing in back to back.

The build quality, interior fit and finish is fantastic. Nothing feels as good- at any price. In terms of size, it is true that this is not a 'family hauler'- which is exactly why I like it so much. I have owned a Cayenne S in the past but I just prefer smaller cars- even though I am a bigger guy. My favorite car of all time (until now!) has been my GTI- and this feels like a bigger/higher end/big-boy version of my GTI.

Yes, they are expensive. Yes, they charge you extra for many things that others provide in their base prices....but, to me, it is well worth it. I looked at x3 M40i, Stelvio, Velar, etc and none of them comes close to the build quality, handling and overall performance of the Macan.

BASE- absolutely good enough if you are not a performance junkee
S- great all around, you won't regret spending the $ for it if you can afford it
GTS- definitely the 'one to get' for the true Porsche experience in a CUV
TURBO- certainly appealing but, IMHO, only if you load it up with the performance/handling features that are standard in the GTS but optional in the Turbo

If you are considering a Macan- go for it- you will not regret it.

porsche,macan,2020,Dave, 04/23/2020,My favorite small luxury performance SUV,5,"I owned the Macan S before buying the base model (to save a few dollars).  The additional power is noticeable, but the base is still a great car.  If power is a concern, opt for the S trim or higher.  Also, rear legroom is tight and cargo space isn't the best, but it's perfect for my needs.  The initial model when the Macan launched had some kinks in the PCM (Porsche's infotainment system), but the newer models are vastly improved.  I looked at most of the Macan's direct competitors, but felt the Macan is still the best in its class.

There was no GTS at the time. Frankly, I live in New York and the ride quality on most roads is brutally harsh. On the highway at high speed it is a true sports car. Its all good if you live in a location with smooth roads. Its fast and very well built. I would not have done this deal without the GTS suspension or pay much less for the base Macan, not the S.

porsche,panamera,2010,Paul Michaelis, 06/06/2016,An old Man's wheelchair,5,"Be prepared to spend money, the initial price is high, any maintenance is costly and good tires don't come cheaply. On the other hand, driving it is a blast, even after 10 years of ownership I look forward to driving it. Of the 4 previous Porsche' I've owned, this one has met all my criteria. The previous Porsche' included 994, 911 Cab, 911 Targa, and 993 wide body....each had its unique features and was enjoyable, but the Pany incorporates all of the enjoyments of the previous cars sans the ability to lower the roof. It's quick, agile, comfortable and different in appearance from all the other cars on the road, still gets thumbs up signals. After 10 years of ownership, several new car issues, I still enjoy it immensely. There were claims that the aluminum block had bore scoring wear issues so I have been diligently having oil analysis done with each change and found the wear characteristics are excellent. One important thing I did was research Porsche's choice of oil. The recommended oil ( Mobil1 0W40 ) has a special additive wear-blend that isn't found in so-called equivalent oils. I stick with Porsche's up front recommendation, period.

I wanted something dependable, sporty, comfortable, packed with luxury, with some power, and unique.  I found everything I was looking for in the Panamera. It is perfect as one reviewer wrote.

Difficult to maintain the speed limit. The Panamera style and performance has lived up to expectation. Interior styling compared to BMW and MB in my opinion beats  both. The center console is a bit much, to many buttons and controls. The Sport Chrono package significantly improves the performance at high speeds. Porsche should build in a standard radar system or allow an option for one. Missing the GPS support such as GM On star or MB embrace. Paid 154k with lo-jack and tire/rim protection.

Superb styling, in and out, despite what the car mags say, performance that rivals cars half it's size (including my Aston Martin Vantage), incredible technology and sheer driving bliss!  The performance/ride settings can satisfy any and all desires.  It can be a supple cruiser or a beastly racer, and it weighs over two tons! Are you kidding me??

Car fires up with the usual Porsche exhaust rush and with the sport button pressed the throttle and transmission are poised for fun driving. Sport plus is held in reserve for those special occasions when there is a worthy vehicle to offer a challenge. Still could use a stronger exhaust note to round out the sensory thrill of G forces on your back. The ultimate four seat luxury sports car that will out run all but a few mega priced cars.

The master tech @ Porsche stated nothing was wrong. After I kept  insisting something was wrong, the North Amer Porsche tech looked at it. Needs a new transmission! This passed Friday, the engine failed. Brought it in and the Porsche dealer stated they could look at it in a couple of weeks. I have owned 7 Series BMW's since '96. Never had service with an attitude like this in all my years with BMW. So the car looks great, drives extremely well, but I am seriously concerned about the engineering. Did they push this model out to quickly?  Did they train the techs to service it? "

I believe its only the second best sedan because my wife has the Mercedes Benz CLS 63 AMG. Though I believe that the CLS is slightly better, this car is a close competitor. The Panamera is slightly less luxurious and ever less sporty, but given that we needed a second sedan, we didn't want two of the same car. The Panamera is great for road trips and trips to the supermarket. The CLS is made for the night in the town or for weekends. Both are fantastic cars, and I'd recommend them both. We have put around 5,000 miles on the Porsche so far. Both the MB and the Porsche have breathtaking performance. Both cars were around the same price ($145,000)."

The Panamera has multiple settings, for the mood of driving. The standard is very laxed such as a 7 series BMW and the 2 levels of sport and Sport plus will pin you to the end of your seat. The interior is very impressive as much as the exterior in my opinion. I feel very in control. The seats contour your back and all buttons are there in direct reach for the driver. The Panamera is fun and in my eyes one of the best looking cars on the road. I have had about every high end vehicle or at least driven them all and this by far is best."

porsche,panamera,2010,Florida Owner, 12/08/2009,New Panamera Owner - Terrific Car,4,"The car is terrific. I got a 4s (yachting blue) after a long wait. The styling is controversial but the car is stunning - stunning - in the metal. Have had multiple people stop to ask about it - see for yourself. Interior is fantastic and the car drives unbelievably. I have had a 911 6-speed and I like cars but I found it was too small, especially for a family as well as feeling unsafe around ubiquitous giant suvs. It really feels like you're driving a Porsche in a way that a Cayenne never would. As well, the hatchback is super convenient. In a purist's world Porsche would only make 911's but in the real world of being a father/family man who also wants a great car, this is beyond compare! "

porsche,panamera,2011,breynolds1957, 03/31/2011,Mixed review...want to love it,3,"First Porsche.
Overall this car is an exciting car to drive.
 The interior is reminicent of a jet cockpit.
There are many ""hard buttons"" to access features which may seem daunting at first. However, everything is logically placed and easily learned, and makes feature selection much easier than drilling down through computer menus.


I have a mixed review on performance. Once the car is rolling, it is superb.
 However, there is a big catch in my opinion.
When pulling away from a standing stop there is a sort of stall/lunge sequence that almost throws you forward then back in the seat. My dealer tells me this is a known issue and likely not resolvable. If so, this is a deal killer."
porsche,panamera,2011,cphollis3, 02/25/2011,"Pure Porsche, But Evolved",5,"This is my fourth Porsche vehicle: Boxster, Carrera, Cayenne, and now this.
All Porsche, yet all different.

The car is deeply impressive and engaging.
It compares favorably against cars costing twice as much, or more.
Handling, cockpit features, design, power, etc. -- all top-notch.
I think the Panamera is now the one to beat in the 4 door sports luxury category.

Most people would be concerned that the V6 would be less-than-powerful.
I drove both this and the S model, and came away preferring the V6 -- lighter, more nimble, and the engine was more responsive than the heavy V8.

The looks have been criticized, but I don't see the problem -- the car looks drop-dead gorgeous to me!"
porsche,panamera,2011,gaucho52, 03/21/2011,Panamera 4 review,5,"First Porsche. Considered and drove several times the following: E350/550, BMW535/550, Jaguar XF, Infinity 37/56, Audi A6.
By far the most fun to drive was the Panamera.
A bit more expensive than most on the list but the most unique on the road.
 The competition is common on the road.
It is fun to get the looks and the thumbs up from many.


The V6 has ample power compared to the V8.
Been getting over 23 mpg on combined city/highway with average speeds of around 45 mph.
This car is a bit sluggish right off the start but it really picks up once you hit 35 mph.
Getting from there to 60-80 is a breeze."

I just had to pay for my third such repair, on a defective valve cover solenoid. Before that, it was a complete replacement of all the ignition coils; replacement of all practically new spark plugs; and a whole bunch of additional repairs for other engine and non-engine components.

Pictures do not do this car justice, as the subtle curves that are Porsche design elements just do not show. The interior is outstanding, clearly the best of all the cars in this class.

At the same time, it has absolutely unreal, incredible sports car handling. The only car I've ever driven that handled the road as well as the Panamera was a 360 Modena. But that was a very noisy 2 seater, you could feel every bump on the road, difficult to get in an out of, etc.

The car is very adequately powered, feels incredibly light for it's size and the interior is a killer! You get the feeling of getting into a jet cabin the second you step into it and that feeling never leaves you through the whole ride!

porsche,panamera,2012,Donna Daisey, 03/03/2017,"Great looks, poor reliability",2,"My initial attraction to the Porsche Panamera was its unique styling and rareness on the road. After less than a year of ownership, I had buyer's remorse. The transmission switching gears is prominent both in acceleration and braking. In comparison, the Mercedes-Benz and BMWs I've owned in the past have been silky smooth. Like both Volkswagens I owned during my youth, this car has electronic gremlins. Upon starting the vehicle, the climate control changes its settings at will about once a month.  Every three months or so, the radio will not work until you turn the car off and start it again. As of 2017, my car only has 25,000 miles, yet things are breaking left and right. The horn stopped working after four years. The trim on the driver's window switch broke off. The passenger window switch is cracked. On a positive note, the car is roomy inside.

The handling is wonderful, sport mode makes it even more aggressive and more of a racing feel.  I love this car and could not be happier with my choice.  I was looking for a high end luxury sports car that could still handle 4 passengers.  There is no other car quite like this.  I drove the Tesla and the Audi as comparison vehicles.  The Tesla felt speedier, but not nearly as luxurious and the Audi while possibly more powerful felt like a fuddy duddy on the overall styling.  Love my Panamera!!!

porsche,panamera,2014,Eric C., 02/19/2016,Huge dissapointment!!,2,"I purchased this car from the dealer brand new with 20 miles on it nearly two years ago. With all the features such as blacked tail light covers,  360 camera views, 20 inch wheels etc. the car is a looker. 

About a year ago I start the car to go to work and I get a transmission error. The warning says the car is driveable but I call the srevive department immediately!  I notice the car won't go into 3, 5 or 7th gear. So I basically limp to the dealership for service. 

Two days later I get it back and I was told it was a software and transfer case issue. All is well or so I thought. 

Last week same scenario.  Start the car, warning light again. I call the dealer, limp to the dealership get in my loaner and leave. 

This time I get a call they have to replace the entire tranny! !!!!

Ok, now I'm upset. Almost 200k on a car with 27k miles and the tranny goes out twice?????? Again, I'm the original owner and all service has been performed by the dealer.

Now it's time to reassess my intent on keeping this car!!

I've owned various luxury Marques to include, Mercedes, Jaguar,  and Lexus. Not one of them needed a new transmission! !!

The 2002 S Class I owned had 14 miles on it when I bought it. I kept it for 9 years and put over 180k miles on it. The biggest expense I even had was replacing the front end suspension and that was due to normal wear and tear. 

How does Porsche get away with being called the most reliable and well built luxury car when their famous PDK transmission failed twice in less than 30k miles???

porsche,panamera,2015,John Magner, 09/23/2015,Disappointing Performance,3,"The Porsche brand is rock solid. This is not my first purchase.  They build a top quality car. The comfort, fit and finish on this car are all outstanding.  However, the enormous disappointment is the performance as a energy efficient hybrid vehicle.  While the press and Porsche engineers report up to 22 miles of pure electric range, driving as carefully as is possible and using hybrid 'sailing' practices and light regenerative braking techniques, I am only getting a range of 11-12 miles of all electric operation on flat roads.  This is by far the biggest disappointment of this car.  Porsche dealer technicians admit it is on the low end but still assert the battery performance is ""within range.""   I have since read that performance on hilly terrain can be as low as 9 miles of all electric range.  Porsche should not have released a hybrid until they were able to deliver better performance metrics.  While, I realize that it may be unreasonable to expect an all electric range of 40 miles for a 4600lb car, their suggested top end range of 22 miles is the performance that should be delivered  consistently.  In this respect, the Panamera Hybrid falls far short of delivering value and the desired effect of a sustainable driving experience for the normal local short driving distances.  Historically, the mantra and philosophy of this Company and its founder was to deliver best in class, but they have clearly missed the mark on this car. Hopefully it is not a sign of things to come for a great legacy brand.

porsche,panamera,2016,Five-time Porsche-o-phile, 12/06/2019,Beauty and beast,5,"I have owned Porsches for 35 years. I found that I needed something with back seats, because it seems odd to invite clients out for dinner and make them drive. I didn't want to give up the performance and handling I've come to know and love. I actually like the first generation Panameras more than the 2017+ models, because I think removing the ""humpback"" made the car less distinctive and I don't like the touchscreen in the new version. I ended up buying the nicest, newest, lowest mileage 1st gen model I could find.

Yes, I got the 2WD 6-cylinder. I like 2WD better than AWD because I like pushing the back end out from time to time. And while the 6-cylinder is not a barn burner, it still handles great. I recently did the Tail of the Dragon with 45 other Porsches and, while it's a big car, it held its own in the curves. 

This car is the best of all worlds. It's my daily commuter and is reasonably efficient. It makes passengers very happy with 4 zone climate controls (including cooled seats in the back). It lets you act like a kid when you want to.

I will have this car for a long time. Or until I can no longer stand not having a Taycan.

porsche,panamera,2016,Pana Mera, 09/04/2016,Great lease deal,5,"I couldn't pass this deal up! I know this is the end of the model year, and the 2017s will be out in about 5-6 months.  The 2017s are gorgeous and undoubtedly will sell at pretty much close to retail. Since I lease for business purposes, a 39 mon lease will go by quickly. I never considered a hybrid, but the deal I was given was less expensive than my 2014 Bmw 640i, a car $25000 cheaper on MSRP!  It was a better deal than an M5, S7, and other models in that range. Are the M5 and S7 great cars also? Absolutely!  Either cars will be suitable. However, as much as I think I drive on racetracks , sporty mountain curves, and drag race stoplight to stoplight, I don't, except in my dreams, as I lust over a Ferrari or Lamborghini.  So, to get a car, that easily fits my family of four, without being frumpy, or a luxury barge, this fit the bill. I was even considering an M3, as those cars are affordable and amazing. Sorry, still got a better deal on the S E Hybrid. The gas mileage is in the high 20s around town, and low 30s on the highway. The range is over 500 miles/tank, so you will not see me at the gas pump very often.

I have not driven my faithful 993 (a 1996 Carrera that I bought new) and do feel a bit neglectful about that. The GTS has a naturally aspirated V-8 so there is NO lag at all when you want to go it just takes off.  My wife likes that the back view is similar to a Jensen.  It does have really good headroom and the rear controls are better than other cars I have owned. If you want a terrific toy then NOW is the time to go to your local Porsche dealer and make a deal.  They really need to sell the remaining 2016 and will drop $20,000 to $30,000 off the MSRP.

We found a certified pre-owned Panamera that appeared to be in pristine condition and fit our budget. We took the leap and have nearly had a recall a month since owning it, the most recent notice ironically arriving while the car was at the dealership for the previous recall.  It’s become a bit of a joke in the neighborhood as it’s quite obvious when I don’t have my car and doesn’t do well for the brand (“another recall?!?”). Our dealership is an hour away and rarely has loaners to offer so service is either delayed, I am without a vehicle, or waiting for service.

porsche,panamera,2017,AB, 12/03/2017,The 4S is marred by a lousy engine,3,"Just replaced my 2017 Panamera 4S for a Panamera turbo. The 2017 and later 4S engine is definitely a disappointment compared to the naturally aspirated V8 of the 2010-2013 model. It is a tiny 2.9 L V6 with twin turbos and has a horrible engine sound and feels very weak until the turbos kick in. It does perform when revved hard but lacks instant throttle response. It let down the whole experience of driving what would otherwise be a good car. The worst aspect is that it is not any more economical than the old V8  and in my experience is a lot thirstier.DONT be fooled by the mpg figures quoted on the sticker. It does NOTHING alike the 21-28mpg quoted. I almost never got over 13 mpg in urban driving and rarely more than 20 mpg on the highway. IN fact many times I got 10 mpg. The problem is that to get any performance from the car you have to rev the engine so hard that the mpg becomes lousy. The small V6 twin turbo is designed to provide great numbers on the govt tests but NOT under normal driving ( remember the VW diesel scandal anyone?- this is similar from the same company!). What a difference the Panamera Turbo model. IT is a 4 L V8 and in a differnt league in terms of engine sound and responsiveness.PLus it gives much better mileage than the 4Sengine despite being more powerful. DO yourself a favor and DONT buy the 4S. You will be throwing a lot of money on a crap engine - not what you want from a Porsche

So after 8 years and I wanted to trade in my convertible for a Targa I never even envisioned parting with my Panny.  So after not getting to a deal, the sales guy said “if you really want a deal my sales manager is trying to get rid of a new 2017 Panamera”. Now, the 2018’s have been out over six months, I’m thinking who wants some 2017 demo ride.  Well it turns out this 2017 black with all black smoked out accessories had exactly 22 miles on it.  I had to admit it looked go but I tried to fight it.  I thought...my 2010 cockpit would never be matched.  Sliding in, she felt strange.  She turn quicker due to the rear wheel steering.  She felt like a smaller car driving but did not feel small space wise from the inside.  Then she growled when I hit the throttle...they are now piping the growl through the speakers....how sweet.  Oh I miss my cockpit still, my lighted door sills, the window shades I never used, and even that thermal tinting that fails to allow my EZpass toll transmitter but a small cut out to function.

porsche,panamera,2018,Seabolt, 07/27/2018,road handling great...electronics suck,4,"The redesign was a huge hit.  The 911-ish back end vs the old 'fat butt' is a smart move.  Road handling excellent.  MPG surprisingly good (28 hwy).  Electronics suck and the driver interface was evidently designed by committee.  Sometimes CarPlay works...sometimes not.  Takes forever for the software to load every time you start the car.  Too many ways to control the same thing (climate, media etc) - and a lot of it is not intuitive.   Audi electronics are far better.  (my 5 yr old Mercedes CLS was more advanced). Two of the five clusters on my dash currently 'out' (dark).  First time it happened (then went back on) dealer said they couldn't find a cause. Front end suspension squeak unable to resolve, though great dealership service

Could not connect the garage door opener despite multiple attemtps. Dealership technician came to home and still not able to fix it. The engine sputters when decelerating on inclines. Not happy about these 2 issues. Has speech recognition button installed in car but the function has been deactivated (not sure why and the dealership's answer does not make any sense). Why put in a button and then deactivate it. Apple car play only works if phone connected via USB to the car and not wireless (in this day and age!!)

"
porsche,panamera,2018,M.S., 01/26/2018,Update on my previous rating above...,3,"Now reliability is becoming an issue. Rear passenger carpet buckling for no reason. Computer system completely crashed while driving to work causing total blackout of PCM and shift lights. Second key fob has been replaced once already with this one failing as well. Drink holder rubber falling off after one use of a small VOSS water bottle. There is also a known issue with window tint on the Panamera for a few years now. (Since I've never liked the prior I never paid too much attention.) Apparently the inner window guides scratch the tint. Front doors only really on my car. Mine isn't bad but I have a perfectly etched line on both of my front windows tint now. There are no proven fixes, either live with it or don't tint. Some people have horrible multi-scratches on their tint making it look awful. So Porsche hooked my car up to their computer and found a fault but have to report to headquarters in Germany for what to do. Hmmmmm $185k for a car I drive to work and all this?? Not too happy. It is a 2018 model as well.

porsche,panamera,2018,Longsofty, 09/03/2018,Owned one and Never again!,1,"Owned the car for about 10 months and the car was in the shop at dealer for total of 7 months in and out.  Yes, I literally drove the car myself about 3 months. There is a true quality issue with this car or perhaps its a Porsche thing.  Many fan boys over look all the issue they encounter or they ignore them thinking Porsche is Apple.  Arrogant Dealership didn't help.  Car was a Lemon and I had to push Porsche to buy back.  PCM goes out all the time, car rattled interior and exterior,  Chrono clock alwyas stopped working, engine light galore, subwoofer kept going in and out and other issues.  Porsche is trying to be too big too fast, until they get their quality under control, they need to go back to basics.  I have owned Mercedes, BMW, Land Rover, etc.  This by far was the most troubled vehicle.  I guess this can be considered a VW Passat with a $140k body kit.  Porsche customer care is a joke.

porsche,panamera,2018,David Chen, 07/25/2018,Personal review of the 4S Sport Turismo,5,"Starting off, the looks on this car are gorgeous. It stands out from the crowd of ""boring"" looking cars and can give you some unwarranted attention on the road or driving in town. Most people won't know that the car is a Porsche however they'll know when they hear it. So my car: a Panamera 4S Sport Turismo (a mouthful to say haha) is Volcano Grey Metallic with the 21 inch high gloss black rims. It has the standard interior in black (enough for me as there's still leather everywhere in the car), Surround View Camera (360 degree camera system that I highly recommend getting if you don't want to scrape your front bumper or expensive rims), Sport Package (which includes the sports exhaust system in black **when put into sport or sport + the car pops and crackles on each up shift and downshift, sport chrono pack **makes the car faster with a faster 0-60 and higher top speed @180mph, and rear axle steering **a must for such a large car like this). I recently picked up the car this month of July 2018 and have already driven nearly 800 miles on it. Talking about the driving dynamics, the car handles so smoothly and there is no transmission out there that shifts as quick or as smoothly as the PDK. The Sport Turismo (fun fact) comes standard with a 3 level air suspension. If you're wondering how much of a lift the car can get, it is approx 0.5 inch or more. With the sport chrono option, you're also able to do launch control (and don't worry, you can do this an unlimited amount of times) which is an exhilarating experience. Moving onto the interior and daily usability of the technology inside. At first, all this tech can seem daunting and confusing at times. However, it took me personally around 20-25 min playing around with all the settings to fully understand the car (it's basically a giant iPad). One of the cool things about the navigation is that it can be put into 3D Google Earth mode. It's very easy to input destinations or look for certain places without putting in the destination. For the media, you have Bluetooth, jukebox, aux, Sirius XM, and more.  My car does not have the extra $5k Burmester Speaker system but has the standard Bose system which still sounds fantastic. In regards to daily driveability and interior space, the sport turismo offers a little bit of more room than the standard panamera but has a lower loading height (if you want a more detailed video, I'd recommend watching Doug Demuro's review of the car on YouTube). The car in normal mode is alright and what I would consider to be the ""boring"" mode. The air suspension soaks up bumps very well even with my car's 21 inch rims. In sport or sport plus the chassis and suspension become more stiff and the engine becomes more responsive and ""alive"". I was surprised that even in the most stiff, most fun mode (sport +) that the car still rode very smoothly (props to Porsche engineering). Overall, if you're in the market for a wagon for the family but you still want it to drive like a sports car, the Porsche Panamera Sport Turismo satisfies both aspects. If you have any more questions about this car or my review, feel free to DM me on instagram @sportturismo_4S.

porsche,panamera,2018,SadOwner, 12/14/2019,Great! (When its working...),2,"I have had the car for 9 months and driven 14K miles... The handling and performance is superb until the transmission can't decide on a gear. Sometimes ""reverse gear is unavailable."" (It's a Porsche, I don't need reverse). No really, can't select reverse! Electronics remind me of a Christmas tree, there is always some warning light on. Don't worry if one disappears another will take its place.  This is truly impressive. The soft touch doors fail intermittently. Cruise- control cuts out. Alarm goes off. Engine loses drive when turning and crossing traffic,(T-bone anyone?) Traction control is always a bump away...  Had a o2 sensor fail. Car would not start. Had a fuel sensor fail, car would not start. So far 4 trips to the shop, totaling 18 days without the car. Buyer reconsider, there are other good looking cars out there that actually work. I am pursuing this vehicle as a Lemon.

porsche,panamera,2018,D.B., 01/25/2018,"Redesigned Panamera 4 is a, “HomeRun”!!!!",5,"I owned a  2011 Panamera 4 and the vehicle turned heads, sometime for the right reasons, or for all the wrong reasons. Either you loved the design or hated the shape/lines of old Panamera. 
The engineer got it right this time around....the car is gorgeous. Everywhere I go, I’m approached regarding the new design and people love it.  The interior of the new Panamera is just as exciting as the exterior.  The interior is very comfortable, well appointed, and hi-tech. Multiple buttons on both sides of console are gone.  Very well designed interior and user friendly.   I love everything about this vehicle, and wouldn’t change a thing. Job Well Done Porsche engineers!!!"
porsche,panamera,2018,JC, 10/17/2017,Everything I Wanted (and expected) Plus More!,5,"While I have only had the car a few weeks, it is everything I expected.  Luxurious and refined when desired or a ""beast"" when you want performance. (Just choose regular, sport, sport plus or custom driving mode.) The car grips the road, including corners, like no sedan I have ever driven. The seats are ultra-comfortable, front and rear. My ratings on reliability and value are only four stars because it is too early to know. Overall I am very pleased with zero regrets. Don't waste another moment spoil yourself today.

porsche,panamera,2018,AJ Coppola, 12/18/2018,2018 Panamara S Disappoints,3,"I currently own a 2013 Panamara 4 and was eager to get an ‘18 S edition as a loaner. It may be tough to complain about such a well built car but when comparing my 2013 to the 2018 it disappointed me in three ways: 1) the dash board is higher and the clock impeded my vision 2) the total electronic dashboard was impossible to use with gloves on (I live in NE Ohio). Also, the layout is not intuitive compared to previous year models when Porsche employed its long endeared one button one function philosophy 3) the variable ratio power steering did not seem to work. Overall it is usually the minor things that disappoint an owner of and potential buyer of $100K+ vehicles.  I’m surprised at Porsche’s lack of attention to detail on this successful model for the car brand.

porsche,panamera,2018,Bill Baldwin, 11/19/2019,I love driving my 2018 Panamera,5,"Living around a large lake in SW Virginia, I love driving the twisty roads around the lake, using the paddle shifting to downshift into curves and then upshift on straight aways. I've always had manual shift cars and don't miss that too much. My first long road trip was returning from Little Compton, RI to SW Virginia in 13 hours, straight, with 2 stops, 760 miles. I wasn't even tiried when I got home, having driven the entire way. The seats are so comfortable! 
Several months ago I drove from the Greenbrier, WV down route 311 to Roanoke, VA with 79 hairpin curves. What a kick! Just touched the brakes, using mostly the paddle shifting. The continual plus is that this car is a head turner. At least twice a month a stranger will come up to me and tell me how great my car looks. In addition, I love the throaty sound the pipes make when accelerating. This is a wonderful car that is a delight to drive!

porsche,taycan,2020,Chris Gervais, 08/24/2020,Electric Dream Machine,5,"I’ve had my Taycan for over a month and continue to be impressed with almost every aspect of the car. The performance is phenomenal and the instant torque is completely addictive, especially at speed. The design is absolutely stunning and it’s truly one of those cars where the pictures don’t do it justice — there’s so many little details that the car really deserves to be seen up close. Like the 911, the Taycan is almost all compound curves that flow beautifully around the car. Interior fit and finish is definitely top-of-the-line. If you’re a fan of physical buttons the all digital control surfaces will take some getting used to. The Porsche Communications Management (PCM) system on the Taycan is brand-new and is still a work-in-progress — the system still has some glitches and performance issues. From a range perspective, I’ve been more that impressed only because the EPA ratings were so low. I’ve regularly traveled 30-40% further than what the sticker says. You can easily get 270 miles on a full charge  (I’m on 20” Turbo Aero wheels with all-season Continental tires) and charging at home has been a revelation. That said, I’m charging my car about once-a-week, and even then the car is usually around 35% state of charge (SoC). Of course, depending on your situation with your commute and COVID-19, you might not be driving much, so you may need to charge even less. Overall, it’s a Porsche: beautiful, extraordinarily solid and well-built, fast, and pricey.

You can have an electrical line added for more increased power to give you 200 miles within 20mins. Same as you would with a gas vehicle, don’t push it to close fill-up when you have time, especially as you rest. Get up jump in the Taycan and love the ride. Hope you get one, enjoy.

I’ve owned a host of sport-equipped BMWs my whole life and have driven a friend’s high-end Telsa.  But none compare to the combination of performance, styling and fun-yet relaxed drivability that this car has.  I’ve had my Taycan for two months now, and I’m still blown-away.  PS - if you’re getting one, add the PDCC dynamic suspension option.  Ivy really keeps this 2.5 ton vehicle flat in the turns.

porsche,boxster,2000,Danielle, 01/03/2007,No Regrets,4,"Owning a Boxster has been everything I thought it would be and more. Nothing beats cruising around with the top down on a beautiful day! I drive my car every day, rain or shine (it's my primary vehicle), and still get psyched each time I see it (it's really mine!) and get inside and start driving. I would recommend definitely getting the car checked out by an independent (not affiliated with the dealer/seller) mechanic before you buy. Although the Boxster is a great car, it's not cheap to own, and you want to make sure the one that you buy is in good shape. I haven't had any major problems with mine, although the top did get stuck in the down position, but was easy and relatively cheap to fix."
porsche,boxster,2000,layedbak1, 01/02/2014,Excellence in Motion,4,"Have driven and owned many cars in my life, and this little Boxster is by far the most fun to drive. The only one I have driven that comes close was a 1965 Jag XKE coupe. The only negative was the IMS bearing issue that I noticed before it became a catastrophe, and had replaced with a LN Engineering ceramic ball bearing IMS bearing. Worth every penny. There's nothing like the growl of that boxster engine at 5500 rpms, or the handling on turns. You haven't experienced the pleasure of real driving until you take one of theses babies out for a spin."

It goes faster and can handle the 
turns faster - but the over-all driving 
experience is very simiilar to the 
Miata.  Whether the Boxster is worth 
the extra 20K over a Miata could be 
well argued, but hey, it's a Porsche."

is an absolute pleasure to drive, it 
performs well and runs as smoothly and 
as tightly as the day I got it which is 
amazing considering I drive it every 
day to work in heavy traffic, starting

I put 5500 KM on it last year with not one problem. It is a fun car only (I have a daily driver) which makes this car feel fresh every time I drive it...I love it. It has very good power and the handling characteristics are absolutely unparalleled. I go top down everywhere...favorite time is early in the morning. Best time of year is in the Canadian fall with a good chill in the air with the seat heaters on and the leaves falling...it does not get any better than that!!!!!!!

Well I absolutely LOVE it!  6 speed is a blast although the steep 1st gear took a bit of getting used to.  The quality of this now 19 year old car is still top notch.  It isn't my daily driver and will never see rain/snow if I have anything to say about it.  Replaced the original top with a 2004 top (glass rear window) and am SO glad I did.  Not cheap to service but it is a rolling piece of art.  Handles like a go-kart and loves 4-4500RPM range!  It was my dream car and now that I have had it a year I would buy another in a heartbeat!

The 18 inch wheels are the way to go. It’s a Porsche so drive it at high RPMs all the time! These cars were not built to be pampered but rather to spoil the driver. The performance off the line is lacking but it accels at everything else. So after 20 years I went and bought a 718 Boxster GTS and also a Cayman S and they both drive and feel like the original Boxster. Mid engine is where it’s at.

No major problems outside of routine maintenance and yes, they are expensive to maintain but your driving a Porsche guys, not a Chevy....

porsche,boxster,2001,Jacob Savala, 03/11/2019,A Great Experience & A Great Car,5,"It's a very fun car to drive and it's very reliable for being a sports car from Porsche. While it isn't a Miata in terms of reliability and repair prices, it catches peoples eyes and has just enough power to make it feel so much faster than a Miata. If you're looking to buy this car I highly recommend taking it to a trusted shop or a other Porsche dealership to have them inspect it before buying the car. It's an amazing car overall with little to no problems. It's amazing as a weekend car and when weather permits you could even use it as a daily commuter. If you're looking for a car that's tons of fun, looks great, and is pretty cheap then this is the perfect car for you. I would also recommend having around $1000 extra just in case something bad does manage to occur. Oh and the IMS Bearing failure only affected about 5% of the Boxsters so I wouldn't frant over it, if you can find out if it's been replaced that's great but if you can't then I wouldn't worry about it, just get it replaced the next time you need to replace the clutch.

Since average Porsche owner drives 6,000 miles a year, cars are usually out of warranty when the trouble strikes. Problem seems that no mechanic wants to take the engines apart, so only fix is $15,000 factory rebuilt engine.

The engine and gearing are such that you just accelerate smoothly and very quickly.  It has been a year, and I am still madly in love with driving this car.

years ago and its a helluva lot of fun. 
Its amazing taking a turn with a sign 
warning you to go 15 at around 60 and 
not have a second thought about it. Had 
a Z3 before the Boxster and it doesnt 
even compare in terms of handling, 
style or power. Pricing isnt great, but 
considering the alternatives, its not 
bad either. Just watch out cuz 50 turns 
into 80 real quick when your not payin 
attention."

annoying minor electrical problems.  
While they have all been covered with 
excellent dealer provided service under 
warranty, the lack of reliability is a 
bit surprising.  Required replacement 
of: Power window switch and motor; 
ignition switch (this one caused 
problems starting the car); turn signal 
bulb; and headlight switch (not good if 
your trying to drive home at night).  
All of this within 9000 miles/3 years."

They did an excellent job of designing the car so that you can carry on a conversation at normal voice levels with the top down.  This car makes driving fun again!  This is the closest I have felt to a car - since I was a young pup and bought a new 944.  I am getting tremendous gas mileage.  I got over 29 mpg on a day trip a few weekends ago.

It is not the fastest car, BUT the handling and maneuverability is so incredible that I think it is better than most super cars.  I also test drove 911s when I was looking for my fun car - this was WAY MORE FUN to drive than the 911s give or take 5 years from this, my 2001 model. That's why I bought this. Once, some 911 owner tried mocking me for owning a Boxster, little does he know that his hubris landed him a less fun, more expensive model to drive from Porsche than my own. Hahaha - jokes on you dude!

The car now has over 108,000 miles on it, and runs like a champ. It easily got up to 122 mph while passing cars driving down that middle lane* (stupid thing to do, but it was just too easy) without realizing how fast the car was going. Driving country roads in East Texas at high speeds (90 mph around 40 mph curves and 120 mph ++ on straight-aways) is a breeze.* apparently there are 2 radiators and it holds 7 gallons of coolant.

porsche,boxster,2001,Ted Phillips, 01/08/2007,Fun Car for the Twisties,4,"I bought my Boxster used and it is by far the finest handling car I have ever driven, that includes several other Porsches. The steering, balance and brakes permit you to drive turns very fast with no discomfort for you or the passenger. It has required no unscheduled maintenance in 56,000 miles, uses no oil and averages about 27 mpg.  The chassis could handle more power (but I could have bought and ""S"" if that is what I was looking for). There are no water leaks, the top is still like new as are the paint and interior. These are great used car buys because of considerable depreciation compared to a 911.  Just be sure to have an experienced Porsche mechanic do a pre- purchase inspection to avoid surprises."

I was a little worried because this model didn't have PSM (stability control), but the handling is so good, and so neutral, that I haven't had a problem.

The quality of the fit and the 
manufacturing of the Boxster is totally 
different to any USA car I have ever

If you can afford the 18"" wheels it 
makes the look and handling better.
Also heated seats makes driving

porsche,boxster,2002,A Driving Enthusiast, 03/19/2020,I want to be buried in it when that time comes,5,"Anyone considering a used sports car should absolutely consider a Porsche Boxster S. I just found a first generation example with about 70k miles on the odometer that had already had the clutch, breaks, and IMS bearing done. This car is transcendent on multiple levels. First, it is a true drivers’ car. Nimble, quick, precise, powerful, and small, it offers terrific, fluid feedback and exhibits a solid, analog feel without ever feeling heavy or stiff. Wonderful to drive fast, it is also a pleasure to drive slowly – it just feels great. On another level it is so well engineered that simply operating it gives me joy: the way the trunk latches with a soft ‘click’, the quality of the build and thoughtful engineering everywhere I look, the ‘thunk’ of the door, the lovely way the shifter engages each gear with a firm but precise ‘snick-snick’, the simplicity of the gauge cluster, steering that makes it seem like your hands are connected to the road, buttons that even after 18 years have no free play. I have owned three 3-series BMWs, a late model Subaru WRX, and tracked a GT-R Nismo. Each is turbocharged, which is great as long as you keep the turbo all spooled up but crappy when you aren’t paying attention and a V6 Accord Coupe blows your doors off. All the others have pretty numb steering, the BMWs – two were even Msports – seemed heavy, dull, and bloated, luxurious though they were, the WRX seemed like it wanted to be a Porsche but was about $30 grand short, and the GT-R would have been great on a long track, where it could made good use of all that high-rev power, but on a short track was just getting fun when I would hit another corner. The Boxster’s naturally-aspirated flat 6 makes a splendid sound – a present but not overbearing burble when driven nicely, e.g. from idle through about 3.5k, and a raucous but not harsh howl as the revs climb to redline – and has torque everywhere – I rarely feel like I need to downshift to pick it up. And, while I wouldn’t characterize the Boxster S as luxurious – what it does it does minimally, precisely, and well – the connection it makes between me, the driver, and our shared commitment, the road, is unrivaled in anything I have yet driven. I might tire of driving it daily in stop-and-go on the I-405 in L.A., but good lord am I glad I have it for my grocery getting on the weekends.

Great looks and top easy to drop.  
Tiptronic acceleration not to good - 0-
60 at 5.9 secs.  Handling is cars 
strength.  Interior is very plain even 
with sport touring package. Cabin is a 
little tight for me at 6"" 3"".  Still 
fun to drive.  Wish engine compartment 
was easier to access."

to receive my 2002 Boxster but well 
worth the wait.  Hard Top, Tip, Comfort

Convertible for this Speed Yellow 
Boxster and I was never wrong in doing 
it. I have so much fun driving it that 
I missed my exits 5 times in the first 
week that I was driving it. The 
handling is superior especially in 
winding narrow roads. The sound of the 
engine is very amusing."
porsche,boxster,2002,mountainhunter, 07/23/2002,Mountainhunter Review,5,"Boxster S is a perfect balance of power 
and handling. Not a very satisfactory 
car for daily driving in city traffic. 
Unbelievable on open twisting roads and 
anywhere that there is no traffic in 
front of you. Last weekend I was stuck 
behind a BMW M3 who seemed to think he 
was going through the curves really 
fast; I wasn't even pushing the Boxster 
and was stuck on his tail."

porsche,boxster,2002,SportsDriver, 06/17/2004,A Purebred Sportscar,4,"I was going to buy a new sports car but 
decided to get this used Boxster S with 
12,000 miles. I drove everything else 
before, and the only car that came a 
distant 2nd place was the 350Z 
Roadster.  On paper the 350Z is a much 
better buy: a bit more power and 
standard options for significantly less 
money, but the ineffable driving 
experience of the Porsche blows the 
Nissan away.  My theory is this 
difference has something to do with the 
Porsche being designed from the ground 
up as a sports car, whereas much of the 
Nissan components are interchangable 
with Altima, Maxima and the G35. "
porsche,boxster,2002,runr53, 07/26/2004,Pure Driving Fun,5,"My second Porsche in 15 years and it's

a year-rounder if necessary.  This is 
truely a fun car to drive...period.  
Performance and quality is #1.  Zoom 
Zoom!!"
porsche,boxster,2003,Pilot2519Juliet, 04/30/2005,There is no better,5,The car is the closest to perfection there is out there. The Boxster will outhandle anything out there now. Road and Track did a slalom run in which it blasted the Enzo's (the Ferrari guy costing  $700K) record. True it does not have an overabundance of hp's but once you pounce on the accelarator you get usable power with unmatch driving dymamics. With a top speed of close to 170 mph I think it is fast enough.
porsche,boxster,2003,tulsajack, 07/08/2014,Think Again!,4,"My dream to own a Porsche. After 2 years & less than 57,000 miles, the engine self-destructed due to a design flaw - a GM alternator bearing used on the intermediate shaft failed and completely trashed the engine. Of course, Porsche lawyers admitted no fault on court documents when they settled, but somehow agreed to pay about 25% of owners' expenses totaling millions. I fell outside the terms of the settlement, so it's tough luck and $0. The repair will cost at least $7K, up to $12K with used parts. This flaw affects 911's also. Because this is a possible outcome, I will never buy another Porsche. Buy a Honda!
Upadate 7/16: I wonder what a lawyer would be able to do with this. Everybody at Porsche had an excuse why I couldn't possibly be considered for any compensation. Live & learn. Get a legally binding powertrain warranty or run the risk of near-total loss. Once fooled, shame on you. Twice fooled, shame on me!
"
porsche,boxster,2003,GF, 08/25/2009,Xlnt sports convertible,4,"Great choice for sports car convertible; very pricey new (keep options list down !) but worth the xtra money in the long run. More comfortable and useful size than it looks. Bought mine new and have used it as daily driver/only car for a number of years. Out of warranty repairs expenses can be high, but maintenance is just once a year for low mileage cars. Hard to give this car up, makes for a great 2nd car keeper once its past its prime."
porsche,boxster,2003,soccercoach99, 06/06/2010,Easy to drive quickly,5,"We have seven cars, including a Honda S2000, Jaguar XJ8, and the American muscle classic 96 Impala SS.  The Boxster is amazingly balanced, and really easy to drive quickly -- with the tiptronic, it's my wife's favorite drive now, and she goes ""top down"" on all suitable days.  I like the Jag for traveling, and enjoy the motorcycle like qualities of the S2000, but have to marvel at Porsche's little roadster!"
porsche,boxster,2003,Raphael Gergi, 02/23/2015,Tiptronic S,4,"I first bought a boxster 1997 2.5L and was absolutely sad about the performance however sold it and got my Boxster S 2003 3.2L, reliable car yes however been finding some difficulties with the transmission (solenoid, Valve Body etc.), i also feel that the car needed a slight increase in the power."
porsche,boxster,2003,GF, 03/17/2010,best of the sports convertibles,4,"Owned it from new; only car I kept this long (7+ years), it works fine as a daily driver not just for weekends. Can be expensive to own in terms of dealer maintenance costs and out or warranty work. Delivers on the promised fun quotient and design aged very well, still very current vs. 2010 model. True sports convertible, not just for boulevard."
porsche,boxster,2003,steve watkins, 04/08/2006,Best Car Ever,4,"I loved Honda S2000 until I drove the Porsche Boxster. It is a great car, fun to drive. I have never had a car that turns so many heads.  It has lots of power, great handling, and it makes going to work a pleasure."
porsche,boxster,2003,Fun in the Sun, 06/21/2008,You gotta love it,4,"Porsche designs the best true sports cars that are accessible to the general public.  You get spoiled by the braking, steering, quality of materials, power, etc.  When I jump in our other cars (BMW 540i and Jaguar XJ6), I realize what makes the Porsche so special.  I also own a 996 coupe, which I absolutely love driving, however when I have a choice of which key to grab, the Boxster wins out.  The Boxster is a great daily driver.  With the top down, the car is perfection!  The Boxster also handles better than our 996.  Mid engine design helps keep the car pointed in the right direction at insane speeds.  We chose our Boxster over the Z4, S2000, Miata Speed, 350 Roadster, Crossfire SRT-6"
porsche,boxster,2003,Speed Yellow, 07/31/2008,Raucous Fun in the Sun,4,"I feel that the outstanding sense of balance is a Boxster's trademark. It's not the fastest of two seat roadsters (even in S form), but it is surely the most fun to drive. The car's handling instills confidence in even the most tenuous of drivers. Cornering is effortless; the car's center of gravity feels like it is located under your seat. The the suspension communicates precisely what you need to know and it transmits your steering and throttle inputs with a smooth competency. The engine sings at higher RPM and begs to be revved to its limits, that's where the power band is and that's where the whole driving experience comes together, putting a big, goofy grin on your face. It's Heaven."
porsche,boxster,2003,M4240Z, 12/09/2003,Awesome Car!,5,"I've always wanted a Boxster, and it's 
everything I ever imagined.  Great 
handling, terrific sound, terrific 
acceleration (even without fully 
breaking in the engine), amazing looks, 
comfortable.  Neutral handling, 
responsive brakes, telepathic steering -
- you just think it around curves."
porsche,boxster,2003,pwr, 02/04/2009,A Future Classic,4,I've had this car for almost two years and haven't regretted buying it.  Great reliability and fun to drive.  A used Boxster is a great deal.  My only misgiving is that the base model lacks low end torque - it is necessary to wind out the engine to 4000+ rpm to get good acceleration.
porsche,boxster,2003,Louise, 04/22/2006,Turning Heads,4,"In my 30 years of driving experience, this is by far the most impressive, fun car to drive. I work for a company that employs 500+ people, and have had people I don't even know approach me about this car. I am getting a ""thumbs up"" from everyone!  It is certainly an attention getter. The looks are impressive and driving it is like a ""mini vacation."" It is a thrill to leave work, put the top down, crank up the stereo and cruise on home. I could use up all the available space in this review and not be able to fully convey what a pleasure this car is to own and drive."
porsche,boxster,2003,Moki, 06/02/2005,My Boxster,3,"During 26 months of ownership it was down for repairs for a total of 90 days with multiple problems over multiple systems from electrical to suspension and lastly a new engine.  I've received no traffics tickets in this car to demonstrate it has been pampered.  Porsche did extend the warranty for two years, but have been very slow deciding how to repair, obtaining parts, and scheduling the work."
porsche,boxster,2003,DIC_CAMARILLO, 12/27/2007,I love this car,4,"This is our 3rd Porsche and what a pleasant surprise.  This car is so easy to drive!  The mid engine design allows this car to be driven so hard.  You feel so confident driving this car fast.  The materials are great, with the exception of some cheap plastic inside.  The power top is wonderful and fast.  Awesome looks!  Great interior, comfortable seats, lots of storage and yes, Awesome looks - did I already mention that this car looks incredible!  If you get one, go for the 2003 and newer.  You get a glass rear window, more power and a glove box.  Those additional items are worth the extra money.  Also, you don't need to get a stick in this car - the tiptronic works well and is easy to use."
porsche,boxster,2003,Wais, 02/04/2009,First Porsche,4,"This is my first Porsche and a dream come true.  I love every minute of driving it, washing it, and detailing it.  I was afraid of getting a Porsche for all the horror stories you hear; expensive, costly maintenance, costly parts, unreliable etc. I bought it used with a 3/36,000 premium warranty and only 24K miles at under $28k! You can't get an average Japanese or American car for that price.  After checking Consumer Reports and JD Power and Associates ratings, I decided to get it. Get it and you won't regret it.  Life is too short not to have fun.  Just cover your basis with a warranty, low mileage, and Carfax, then live life! "
porsche,boxster,2003,tice75, 04/19/2009,"Fun, but costly...",4,"I was fortunate enough to own this vehicle for about 18 months.  I bought it in 2007 with 5500 miles on it and put close to 20k on it in the year and a half that I owned it.  It was near new!  This car is incredibly fun to drive and the pick up is amazing.  Being 6'4"" tall, I was reasonably comfortable, but on long trips, a good stretch after a couple of hours is helpful.  My overall ownership experience was OK, but it was rather expensive to own.  I probably wouldn't buy another Porsche again."
porsche,boxster,2003,Man4PNW, 01/08/2019,Seduced by a car,5,"I decided to buy myself a birthday present and the Boxster S was it. It's hard to put into words the driving experience.  I first learned to driver when I was 12 years old. My father got me into go cart racing.   The best way I can describe the Boxster S is that it is a go cart for adults.   At 6'1"" 225 lbs I was concerned that it might be too small.  I found it was amply large enough for me.   Having both a front and rear trunk there is ample storage for weekend get aways for my wife and I.  Fuel economy is fair for a performance car averaging right around 24 MPH on the highway.  But the real thrill is acceleration and handling.  The car is ridiculously glued to the pavement The car takes precision cornering to a new level. I took the car to a Porsche Club of America driving skills class.  During the wet skid pad exercise the car remained flat and level.  With the top down and the windows up it's quite cozy even on a cool day.  Both heater and AC do a great job.  The Boxster S and and an open road make driving a thrill again.

excellent handling-even on slick roads-
,they run great, and the design is 
great also.the only thing that I do not

porsche,boxster,2003,jawgagirl, 10/11/2003,Fun Car,4,"While the Boxster isn't the ""awe-
inspiring"" look as the 911, it is an 
awesome little car. I traded an 00' 911 
cab, so I do have insight in 
comparisons. Actually I've enjoyed the 
Box more, the reasons: more luggage 
space, but more than that, is like 
having a trained dog vs. an untrained 
one. The 911 seems to always be at the 
end of the leash, pulling out of 
control, while the Box is a very 
enjoyable ""walk"" (ride) in the park."

miles in two months.  I'm totally 
satisfied. The only negative about this 
roadster is the price;  I justified 
this over the BMW Z4 primarily because 
the Z4 looks odd and the Boxster has a 
classic beauty.  
   I guess the women at my office agree 
on the looks issue: I've had more 
compliments in the last 2 months than 
I've had in the last 25 years!  But I 
really bought it for performance and it 
has not disappointed on that score.. at 
all."

considerably quieter with the top up. The

the interior much nicer than the

porsche,boxster,2003,tpdj, 08/08/2003,Boxster S is awesome,4,"Nothing but good things to say about 
the car.  Handles exceptionally well.  
Fun to drive.  Great weekend getaway 
car that can handle luggage for two 
people for up to a week or more on the 
road.  Acceleration is smooth, not neck 
breaking.  But can hit high speeds 
before you know it.  The sound coming 
out of the pipes and the intakes is 
unique and music to the ears.  Top is 
easy to put down and up, and when up is 
surprisingly well-insulated from wind 
noise."

Boxster.  I love it.  I've also owned 
BMW's and Corvettes, but there is 
nothing like a Porsche.  The handling, 
speed, dealer network and Porsche 
panache is hard to beat.  If I had my 
choice of any car in the world, and I 
do, I'd still chose a Porsche.  And the 
Boxster S is a real Porsche and a great 
value"

extremely fast, but I would like to see 
300 horsepower in this little car in 
2004, then it would blow any car off 
the road.  I always have fun burning 
old corvetes and people with cars they 
think are hooked up.  I always do 0-
60mph's and my best recent one was a 
5.38 which is awsome and fasttttt, my 
best 1/4 mile was 13.39 which is also 
great.  Get on the road with one today 
it rockkks."
porsche,boxster,2003,chandler, 10/01/2003,too good to be true,4,"This car has been everything I wanted 
and more.  The one exception is the 
cheap plastic for the air vents and the 
front middle console has to be revamped 
for real use.  As well the steering 
wheel could use a tilt.  I have driven 
the car accross country twice, one in 
winter, and a tild would be of the 
greatest value.  I would love to be a 
spokesperson for this car and as a 
father of two young ones, it is my 
everyday car.  Price, handling, style 
and reliability all come for a price 
that I find very impressive.  But thats 
what I always thought a Porsche would 
be ever since I first wanted one.  At 
the age of about 6.  Kyle Chandler."

porsche,boxster,2003,JAdmiral, 10/23/2003,An E ticket ride in your garage!,4,"After nearly ""sold"" on a BMW Z4, I 
reminded myself the the Boxster 
exists.  I've always loved the car 
from afar, but hadn't considered it as 
a car I could really own (don't ask). 

One sit led to a test drove on the 
standard Boxster.  Great ride, and 
lots of fun, adequate power.  However, 
once I drove the Boxster S, it was a 
puppy sale.  I couldn't own anything 
else!

The car is a blast to drive, tons of 
power, and corners so flat, you feel 
like you're on rails!"

2004 boxster...no other vehicle I've 
driven stirs the senses with a dash of 
adrenaline. The immediate response to 
the gas pedal puts you comfortably into 
the soft seats while hugging the road.

porsche,boxster,2003,ds2k1, 01/08/2004,Is this heaven?,5,"Haven't had my Boxster S long, but I 
can't imagine a better first 
impression.  Handles unbelievably, has 
excellent power and torque, is 
absolutely gorgeous to look at, has an 
excellent amount of storage for its 
class, is pretty roomy inside, and 
provides about 95% of the thrills of a 
911 cabrio for at least $30K less.  And 
for me, it is an absolutely livable 
everyday driver, whereas the S2000 (the 
other car I considered) is not.  If 
you're thinking about the Boxster, just 
do it - you won't regret it!"
porsche,boxster,2003,jpcourt, 03/08/2004,Now this is a car,5,"Ive now had this car for a couple of 
months and have put on about 1200 
miles. I love this car, it handles 
great stops on a dime and all and all 
is one terrific sports car. I drove 
just about every sports car in this 
price range and I kept coming back to 
the Boxter S, in my opinion you cant 
go wrong with this car."
porsche,boxster,2003,boxster008, 03/08/2003,Boxster S,5,"If you like to drive, buy a Boxster S.  The regular Boxster is almost as good, but the ""S"" gives you just enough extra power to pass on an uphill curve in 6th gear.  This is my first convertible and I wonder why I never bought one before.  I drive it to work every day, rain, shine, snow or sleet.  Even though the rear end slides a little when it is slippery, it never gets stuck.  Indeed, the fun of a little drift is one of the reasons I bought it without traction control.  Why let a computer drive your car for you?  I can't understand why some drivers put these cars in the garage all winter--it means you don't have fun several months per year.  I guess that is why Porsche made the Cayenne."
porsche,boxster,2003,The Ironman, 07/09/2004,Golf Clubs may ride shotgun,4,"Great German roadster with lots of 
attitude.  You can weave through 
traffic, get to work, put in your 
hours, and still make tee time.  If 
you play golf, certain bags will fit 
in the rear trunk, but you will have 
to remove the woods and lay them in 
seperately or let them ride shotgun.  
Bose system is a must if you plan on 
going topless.  I've had a few 
problems with the stereo and the 
dealership has tried to correct it the 
second time but was not successfull, I 
hope they will get it right the 3rd 
time around.  Besides that, it has 
been a great addition in the garage."

crisis, the Boxster is the best all

owned.  Great looks, performance and 
relative value, especially compared to 
the 911 convertible. Don't spend the 
extra 10K for marginal performance 
improvement offered with S model."
porsche,boxster,2003,LemmyCaution, 05/21/2003,After 4 years - I'd do it again,4,"The Boxster I'm reviewing is actually a 
99. 1999 was not an option in the 
pulldown.

After four years, I'd buy another 
Boxster. I've driven the new Boxster is 
great. I guess at some point, I'll buy 
an S but mine still has less than 
40,000 miles and is still as solid as 
day one. 

In Los Angeles traffic, with a 5 speed, 
it is a delight to drive. Driving home 
is the perfect antidote for a long day 
at the office, top down full moon over 
the Pacific.

Plenty of luggage space for a long 
weekend 4/2 including golf bags.

For what it is - a simple roadster for 
the 21st century - this is a perfect 
car and a credit to Porsche."
porsche,boxster,2003,BillinCO, 05/23/2003,Disappointing number of rattles,4,"Yes, it's a convertible, but Toyota and
Lexus convertibles seem to not suffer
from the number of squeaks and rattles
the Boxster does, especially with the
Hard Top option.

But in a nutshell. no other vehicle
handles like the Boxster. When taking
turns on twisty roads you will think the
car is violating the laws of physics as
there is no excitement, the car just
TURNS.  The phrase ""corners as if on
rails"" is overused, but in the case of
the Boxster it's as if the car is riding
atop a monorail.

You will need to find new roads to
conquer as all your old favorite
twisties will, to be blunt, become
BORING in the Boxster."

This was a great decision and for a

Excellent handling, turns heads at

Tiptronic, the gear shifting using the 
switches on the steering wheel is a 
dream and ""I am in a racing car"". I have 
wanted a Porsche all my life, and this 
makes my commute enjoyable for the first

porsche,boxster,2004,David Schwartz, 04/27/2016,Caution! It's a 12 Year-old Sports Car,5,"I recently bought a 2004 S model. It is a really great performing roadster and by far the most comfortable sports car I've owned, and I've owned a dozen of various makes. This car is way faster than most people need and handles like it is on the proverbial rails. The quality of the fit and finish is very high. 

I'm posting here mainly to advise folks considering one to remember the reason they have depreciated so much from their original price: a successful class action lawsuit against Porsche. The mechanical failure rate of the engine in this model may be as high as 8%. The main thing that causes the engine to be destroyed is the Intermediate Shaft Bearing, which has several design flaws. It frequently fails without warning. The cost of a rebuilt motor, installed, is between $15,000 and $19,000; equal to or more than the car is worth. Fortunately, the bearing can be replaced for about $1,600, or about $2,600 with a new clutch at the same time. If you're going to buy this model Porsche, plan on making the repair soon after the purchase.

porsche,boxster,2004,NDALUM, 06/27/2009,Amazing car to drive,4,"I've had a Mitsubishi GS, SRT, Turbo charged Passat among others. Even though the others were brand new or close to it when bought, I traded my 2008 Passat for a 2004 Boxster S and cannot be happier.  It is a blast to drive, super super fast. Not as fast as the M3 or Vette I test drove, but way more of a head turner. Top down is sick. It's quite the pick and the engine sounds sweet. It is quite the head turner, a blast to drive, and my daily driver. Just could not drive a 4 door to work anymore. "

This car was designed as a modern version of the Porsche 550 Spyder of the 1950s and it is a blast to drive as I'm sure that car was/is.  It has the technology to make even long drives comfortable and the Bose sound system is the best I have ever heard (home or in a car.  It even beats my 2007 BMW 335i Harmon Kardon system).  This car gets looks everywhere I go and rightly so-It is a beauty.  I would strongly encourage anyone to purchase this car-you won't regret it!
porsche,boxster,2004,Mr. cars...., 03/25/2005,like no other...period!,5,"There are many 2-seater convertibles out there for a variety of prices...most are more affordable than the Porsche Boxster...but none are more fun to own and drive!  This vehicle handles incredibly and although it has sufficient power for our taste...the ""S"" version should provide sufficient power for the most decerning enthusiast.  While the Corvettes are slightly faster to 60 mph...you don't get there in as classy a car as the German Porsche. The Bose sound system is exceptional as well....making the entire top down experience something to look forward to everytime we take it for a drive.  There is no substitute!"
porsche,boxster,2004,M.T., 01/14/2005,Definition of a sports car...,4,"Not only does this car handle incredibly, it fits any driver like a glove and provides them with a much better ""feel for the road"" than any huge, SUV will ever be able to do.  The plain black interior, when accented with aluminum pedals and gauge bezels, is so stunning, that many of my car ""afficionado"" friends have said it looks better than most other over-blown sports cars.  I think for 2005 they're  over doing the interiors of the Porsches....too much luxury...not enough ""sports car""!  Definately get the Pirelli P-Zero tire combination. Its the best.  Its hard to beat a Boxster if you want to drive a modern version of a throwback to the past!  Well done Porsche...how can you top this car?"

But i love this car. it handles like a dream and i love the sound of the engine and the xenon headlights. not as fast as my 08 mustang gt in a straight line but feels faster top end. turns heads everywhere i go. i recommend it if you are looking for the coolest and best handling car without spending a ton of money. just avoid the S model due to engine problems and find one with low miles and the bose stereo. mine has the base stereo and it kinda sucks.

porsche,boxster,2004,Racerxm, 06/09/2004,Sensual Porsche,5,"My Porsche Boxster ""S"" model is the 
hottest, best performance vehicle I've 
ever owned.  I've always driven sports 
cars with a manual transmission, but 
this six-speed is the fastest 250 hp, 
especially for the money.  Brake system 
is superior, and suspension is tight 
and precise.  Drives even better in the 
rain, but sunny days with the top down 
is the most thrilling."

could use more power, but this car is 
tractable in town, plenty of usable

can put the top down.  It is a great 
joy to drive, strong acceleration, 
smooth gearbox that I enjoy double 
clutching, and incredible grip. We seek 
out roads with curves just to feel the 
lateral force when it is accelerated 
out of curves.  Dealer has been very 
good, although parts are pricey. I had 
to replace an ignition cylinder and it 
was $400.00.  Two of us who do not pack 
very well can fit enough luggage for a 
long weekend, including carrying the 
car cover. Exceptionally strong air 
conditioner allows top down driving on 
hot summer days.  This is my first 
Porsche but I know now why Porsche 
owners are so fanatical."

ride is firm but surprisingly supple 
with standard suspension and 17 inch 
wheel upgrades.  The engine's voice is 
perfect: refined aggression without 
ostentation.  Buffeting is mild with 
the top down.  The cockpit is a bit 
noisy with the top up.  The 2003 model 
has the cup holders, glove compartment 
and glass rear window (sweet!).  The 
seats are well sculptured but could 
use a bit more lumbar support.  The 
base radio is abysmal.  You definitely 
want to upgrade this. Or, just leave 
the radio off, put the top down, find 
a beautiful winding road less traveled

they just keep getting better.  How many cars make 
you smile when you turn the key and, at the same 
time have two trunks?  Of course, it is all about the 
driving experience and this one has it all:  Sports 
care manners in a car that you can use everyday.  I 
know that some will find it outlandish, but I have a 
hard top and ski rack and I really use them.  
Handling in the snow can be exciting, but that is 
what driving this car is all about.  The plain interier 
is very Teutonic and quite fitting in a real sports 
car--this isn't a Lexus or Mercedes after all.  Just 
drive it!"
porsche,boxster,2004,Old Guy, 05/11/2005,Mid-life love,5,"My 2004 Porsche Boxster has been a treat to drive.  I never understood the whole sports car thing.  It was a gift from my boss which my wife quickly claimed as hers.  We both drive it and could not be happier with anything else.  We are now looking at getting the Porsche SUV because of how this car has behaved.  In addition, the dealership has been beyond wonderful.  If all Porsche dealerships are like this all other dealers should shut their doors and go home.  I love the car!  Can you say ""wind in my hair""?  Can you say ""officer I am 50 and this is my first ticket-ever!""?  Can you say ""listen to that exhaust note""?  Can you say ""why did I wait this long""?"
porsche,boxster,2004,Car Expert, 03/05/2006,This car can't miss....,5,"If it's the best sports car convertible for the money you are looking for...the Boxster is the car to get.  It out handles most every other automobile on the road...including some exotics!  While the ""S"" model is the one to own if extra horsepower is what you want...the standard Boxster has plenty of power to dust off most wanna be sports cars....like their marketing campaign says...Porsche..there is no substitute!"
porsche,boxster,2005,scott c., 11/15/2008,Engine failure/balance shaft broke apart,3,Purchased 2005 Boxster S brand new. Never had any major issues until about 2 years with 20k miles. That's when vehicle had complete engine failure/balance shaft broke apart. Since the car was still under warranty car was towed to my local dealer. I was told the balance shaft broke causing complete engine damage! The dealership service dept had no loaners and I was without the car for 3 weeks. When the car was given back to me interior and exterior was scratched up and steering wheel was off center. I did not want to keep the car and called/meet with Porsche rep to discuss. Porsche N.A. rep would not help at all! Due to poor reliability I traded to Mercedes.
porsche,boxster,2005,tom_dz, 09/27/2011,Awesome/Affordable Sportscar,5,"I purchased my 2005 Boxster in 2006 (then 9,000 miles; now 64,000).
I have not looked back since.
It is surprisingly comfortable for such a tight-handling car.
It looks and feels as mean as it sounds.
And to my surprise, maintenance issues have been few (air/oil separator replaced).
I could not ask for a better all-around sportcars.
I highly recommend the model and year."
porsche,boxster,2005,RJosephs, 03/23/2016,A Sure Cure for the Commuter Doldrums,5,"After one year in the saddle and 3,000 miles of pavement conquered, the verdict is in -- superb job Porsche! I sold my 2001 Porsche 911 after a rather enjoyable but just as disappointing two years of ownership. After missing my Carerra for a few months I set out to find a newer and faster Porsche than my 996. I settled on a low mileage Boxster after an unplanned test drive left me quite impressed and smiling. I enjoy it more than my old 996. It sounds great, has good power, handles fine, and has been a joy to own. It has the sports chrono package and an upgraded six speed manual so it is a little more peppy than cars without those options. The engine sounds like a symphony when driven hard - especially when the exhaust echoes off tunnels and wall. Basically, the whole car just feels like a well engineered piece of fun. The car is fairly comfortable also.  However, the car loses some points when the top is up for some annoying transmission noise and loss of exhaust sound and interior noise. I can only imagine what the new models must be like to drive. Well, except for the new version with a 4 cylinder. The Porsche flat 6 is a treasure. For the money, a used Boxster is a great deal.

porsche,boxster,2005,Russ, 09/15/2008,2005 boxter s (bought used with 5700 mi),5,"I have been looking and test driving cars for 9 months (long time I know ). Drove vette 5 times, boxster and caymen about 5 times, 911s 3 times, z4, viper etc. The boxster was my favorite bar none (like it more then 911 s) but still couldn't pull the trigger. Well I finally purchased one and my goodness I couldn't be happier. This car is absolutely awesome in every way. It eats curves, the engine sound is better then music, and the build quality is outstanding. The fact that you can stay below 50 mph and have a blast is a big plus also (I don't think you can do that in a viper or vette as they require more room to make you smile IMHO)!"
porsche,boxster,2005,Michael_W, 12/29/2007,Catastrophic Engine Failure,4,"Leased the 2005 Boxster S in February. Other than sidelight issues and a tire blowout in the upper peninsula of MI that required an excursion via flatbed trailer for 150 miles to the nearest town and a two day wait for the replacement tire it would have been an uneventful trip. The real fun started in the 2nd summer of ownership when the counterbalance shaft snapped in half with 10,127 miles on the odometer. Porsche replaced the engine 6 weeks later at their expense with a remanufactured 2006 version. Michigan summers are noted for their brevity so the six week layup took the fun out of the relationship. I flipped the lease in spring of 2007 and still miss the car. Reliability is an issue."
porsche,boxster,2005,T Grippo, 07/28/2005,2005 Porsche Boxster,5,"As a former Corvette fanatic I carefully researched and tested both the C6 Vette as well as the Boxster 987, both are extremely good cars but the Porsche has better handling and comfort as well as storage space, not to mention the acceleration and power. The S model Boxster is even faster! Also insurance premiums are much better than the vette which has a high theft rate. I own the regular version, not the S version and it is without a doubt the best car I have ever driven! Gas mileage is in the range of 22 mpg average. After owning 3 Vettes, Porsche made a believer out of me!"
porsche,boxster,2005,Smiles, 06/06/2005,2005 Boxer S Problems,3,"I bought the car one week ago and I have about 650 miles on it. The problems that I have encountered in the first week are: the car was delivered low on oil so I had to go out and purchase oil to put in it two days after the purchase, the paint is already coming off the front intake next to the bumper, the convertable roof broke on decline and now no longer works, and the brake warning light has already come on. Truth be told is I get a new car every two years and this will be my first and last Porsche. This is a fun car to drive, but I am questioning build intergrity and quality of craftsmanship. Make sure you research the car well before you buy it and good luck."
porsche,boxster,2005,Bonzai, 07/19/2005,Excellent Upgrades to a Sweet Ride,4,"With the upgrades made to the new 2005 Boxster S, Porsche has made a great car a truly excellent car. The balance and handling of this car is spectacular. Although horsepower is lower than some rivals (i.e a Corvette), the engine is super smooth and pulls really well through most of the rpm range, doing 0-60 in 5.0 seconds. The interior finishing is much better, and the exterior makes the car look a lot more muscular. If I lived in an area with lots of straight, open roads, I might be tempted by a 400+ horsepower car.  However, I live in an area with lots of winding mountain roads and wouldn't choose anything different.  The Elise would handle as well but is too unrefined to drive every day."
porsche,boxster,2005,Barry Glover, 08/01/2005,Boxter S - 2005,4,"Traded my 2003 911 on this vehicle as I liked the styling better than the 911 and the performance is near identical at a much lessor price.  Great folding top, nice fit and quiet in cabin.  The mid-engine actually handles better on curves than the 911."
porsche,boxster,2005,jeremp, 09/16/2011,Over 100k and still a fantastic drive!,4,"I purchased this beauty in April (2011). I Dr. traded it in at 100k miles. He did all the service religiously, and it works fantastically. The manual spoiler switch was broken when I bought it but a part from SunCoast Porsche fixed it. I do the work myself which keeps maint. costs down. I am a simple guy with a simple income but I feel rick driving the Boxster around town. I never put the top up, (I drive an 05' IS300 on rainy days) and I still get 24-25 MPG. I LOVE this thing!"
porsche,boxster,2005,gsd98jsh, 03/03/2006,987 vs 986,5,"I owned 986 (2001 Boxster) and just upgraded to 987 (2005 Boxster). The sound of the new model is so much better. The new manual transmission is so tight and precise. The clutch is so much easier to operate than traditional Porsche models. The taller roll bar and lower seat allows tall person like myself (6' 2"") to fit in the car much more comfortably than before. I had one modification on my old 986, Becker Radio (CDR2200?) allowed me to install an auxillary line for iPod, but the new fiber optic digital audio system has to have FM transmitter in order to connect your iPod. In other words, the sound quality from your MP3 player really suffers. I guess I will have to begin burning many CDs."
porsche,boxster,2005,Body Imager, 07/05/2005,A Great Car Just Got A Lot Better,5,"Two days ago, the dealership that I have purchased several cars from within the past two years, brought my new Boxster S arctic silver with black top.  I had to drive it off of the flatbed and as soon as I sat down, I instantly realized how much better the seat was than the 2004 model.  Instant comfort!  The interior is dramatically improved and much more comfortable.  I traded an Audi A8L which had comfortable seats, but to be honest, the Boxster's fit my bottom much better with less lateral pinch from the lower seat sides.  The new Boxster seems much more civilized, but with a better exhaust note.  It, as well as the previous Boxster, are much more fun to drive than the 2004 Carrera 4S!"
porsche,boxster,2005,biscon, 06/10/2008,Best overall sports car,5,"The 05 Boxster S is the best sports car on the market for the money. Why? It has performance, styling, ride, utility (2 trunks fore and aft), economy (23 mpg overall)and technology (top stores in 10 seconds).I still get positive comments from passersby after 3 yrs with this car."
porsche,boxster,2005,Ginzaman, 08/08/2008,Best car you can buy!,4,"I had my own problem.  Starting with Engine failure due to broken intermediate shaft.  Dealer took it for few weeks and put a new engine after 21k.  I had few other things going bad but still love my Porsche. Went to dealer probably about 10 times for minor things after that. I will probably get something like GT3 or 997S model next time.  I think they could have done a better interior job but you get what you pay for.  Love my car top down and still able to beat many cars like G35, 350Z, BMW 335ci and many many more.  Can keep up with old M5 and Vantage.  It's pretty impress for the money.  Need grippier tires, like Vredstein."
porsche,boxster,2005,Terry, 05/01/2010,What a blast to own and drive,4,"My wife and I purchased this car for her recently from a friend of ours who collects sports cars.  It's ""her"" car but I just can't seem to keep my hands off of it.  It's so much fun to drive I'm looking at buying another one just so I don't have to beg her for the keys.  It's cool looking, sounds great, handles like it's on rails and is like riding a bolt of lightening when you push it hard through the gears.  Just plain love it. Thanks Porsche!"
porsche,boxster,2005,Henry, 03/27/2005,Boxster S is a Blast,4,"Looked at Z4 and even the new 911, but I thought the Boxster had the best styling. New 280 HP engine just rips and mid-engine design make handling world-class.  Seats are very comfy, the automatic top (with glass rear window) is awesome.  Boxster used to remind of SLK--a bit of a girl's car. No more--new Boxster is one of the world's best sports cars."
porsche,boxster,2005,fungfucius, 04/29/2005,New 2005 Boxster,4,"I ordered my 2005 Porsche Bosxter with no extras at all; only the most basic car: 5-speed manual, and red in color.  Absolutely no complaint.  The sound of the engine is gorgeous.  The basic car is already good enough as it includes the stability control (an option in the 2004), an on board computer, and the crusie control.  I've had a Mercedes, a BMW, and this is my first Porsche.  Each time, i've been very satisfied with the sales person (however, I hated the Mercedes SLK!)"
porsche,boxster,2005,Stormy, 12/16/2017,Jekyl and Hyde?,5,"Great, fun driving car at the outset when I purchased used @ 24k miles. Spirited and exhilarating performance, superb handling and intelligently laid out interior/instruments. Fortunately I purchased from a dealer and opted for an extended warranty, as I experienced an IMS failure at 38k while traveling cross country. I replaced the engine with a new 06, and have found it to be even stronger, and recently competed another 7,200 mile trip in it. For me, every relationship has it’s ups and downs, and after having experienced an engine fire in my 1970 911, and owned 2 914’s in my youth, I can’t imagine driving any other make!

porsche,boxster,2005,SDHARMANI, 05/29/2005,Linear response,5,Boxster has phenomenal handling and response.  Everything from steering to accelerator to brakes responds to the driver as if it were the extension of the driver.  The mid engine design provides excellent stability.  What I love the most is going 0-42mph in 1st gear and then 42-80 mph in the second gear!
porsche,boxster,2005,emilie, 06/11/2005,MUCH improved since 1999,5,"In 1999, before Boxster S existed, I bought a new Aerokit Boxster. I had gone from a '98 Carrera S (that roofers dropped a roof on!), to the '99 Boxster. The '99 was a disappointment, lacking ponies under the hood. The 2005 Boxster S is a world apart in 6 years.   I am extremely pleased with the Tiptronic transmission, the acceleration, the handling and definitely the new body style for 2005.  Probably the only disappointment was the $61,000 price tag."
porsche,boxster,2005,j. zolyn, 09/09/2005,Defying the laws of physics,5,This is my first Porsche and the best car I have ever owned. The main feature that I enjoy the most is taking turns at 65 mph when the yellow caution sign states 30 mph. I have to fight my wife when it comes to who gets to drive and she hates to drive...until now.
porsche,boxster,2005,tmc, 10/10/2005,M3 killer?,4,"I owned an E46 BMW M3 convertible (current M3 for those who don't know) and this car blows it away.  How can 276 hp beat 333?  It's lighter and handles amazingly through the curves.  I compared it to a Z4 3.0i and the Boxster S won hands down. It's hard to find the limits of this car in a turn, it's just that planted.  And the engine sounds great!  My only regret is I wish I had gotten sport chrono for the remapped accelerator option, but that's not all that important in the scheme of things.  Suggestion to anyone buying one: get a good radar dectector!"
porsche,boxster,2005,tony p, 12/14/2005,Love my Boxster,5,My Porsche Boxster does not have as much muscle as my old 1999 Chevrolet Corvette but it has adequate power for me.  It certainly is a lot more fun to drive and more comfortable. It has no roll on the curves.  It feels like you are attached to the road surface.
porsche,boxster,2005,Harrison, 03/13/2006,A dream come true...,4,"I love this car.  I had a problem with the heating vent directors breaking.  2 of them broke in normal use. The dealer replaced them. They are fine now.  My only complaint - the clothes hanger hooks on the back of the seats are so shallow in depth that you cannot get even one hanger on them.  They are totally useless.  This is a design oversight that needs attention.  Other than that...well, the windstop does rattle a bit, which others have mentioned.  Indeed, it could fit more snuggly.  But hey, this is such a fun car to drive!  Everytime I get in, put the top down, crank the tunes on the Bose system (excellent!) it is like a mini vacation. The '05 model is a huge improvement over previous models."
porsche,boxster,2005,WECoyote71, 06/02/2006,Jawdropper,5,This is a fantastically designed ride with one-of-a-kind racecar-like power and handling. The '05 refresh augments the beautiful lines of the classic Porsche and carries those design elements into the interior cabin.

While many will not notice the exterior changes, the design is much better executed.  The interior is worthy of a car of this reputation.  The new Boxster S is truly one of the most intensely, pleasurable driving experiences I have ever enjoyed.  Even if I could afford its bigger brother, I would not justify the 911 over the Boxster.

Power is good, but there are lots of cars that will beat you.  Feels great at speed and is a real confidence builder.  Engine is tied tighly to rest of drive train and is very responsive.  Great looks and a real head turner.  Seats are very comfortable (get the power seat option) and driving position is excellent.  Visibility is great too.  Engine makes that wonderful sound.  Make sure you use premium and a little octane boost does help.  I have had an issue, the passenger side power window stopped lowering when you grab the door handle (needs to do this with the top up, since the window binds)."

However, the test drive I took definately showed me that the 987 is better than the 986. The car is so much fun to drive. The bump is horsepower is enough to be noticed (especially in sport mode). Great handliing is retained. The interior is very nice! I could not imagine a better two seat roadster. The new updated exterior is gorgeous. Go Porsche!"
porsche,boxster,2005,C. Blackman - Texas, 07/14/2005,A REAL Sports Car,5,"The new Porsche Boxster is their ""BEST TO DATE"" sports car.  Previous models have been fine, but this car is way outstanding.  Fast, Fun to drive, quiet with the top down and you can drop the top while you are driving under 30 mph.  I have had the car for two weeks and it ""turns heads.""  Bose stereo is great.  Terrific ""Ice cold"" air conditioner (a must for Texas). Interior finish work is as fine as Mercedes; very well laid out instrumentation, etc.  I checked out several convertibles and this car was the best all around car."
porsche,boxster,2005,E. Ward, 08/01/2005,"Hits the ""Sweet Spot.""",5,"A absolute joy to drive.  It is stylish,responsive and powerful. Distinctly superior to every other car I've owned, which includes not only a current model BMW M3 and an Audi TT 3.2 but also a Porsche 911 (996)."
porsche,boxster,2005,mackay spears, 08/11/2005,Happy owner,4,This is my first Porsche and definitely the finest automobile I have owned to date. It has been more fun to drive than I imagined and it's quality and engineering continue to impress me.
porsche,boxster,2005,gsd98jsh, 05/30/2006,Best Upgrade from 986,5,"I had 2002 Boxster (986) and upgraded to 2005 Boxster (987). So far I have 16,500 miles on the new 987. There are so many improvements done to the new model. Besides the obvious new look on both exterior and interior, now a tall person does not have to hunch due to the lowered seat. The gear shifter is shorter and more precise. The suspension is also tighter and feels much better. Overall, I am so glad that I upgraded from the 2002 986 to the new 987. I will probably end up purchasing 988 if such model comes up from Porsche. "
porsche,boxster,2005,Patrick, 08/14/2006,First Timer,5,I have waited a long time to purchase a Porsche. I have not been disappointed in the least. The available power and steering through sharp curves is incredible. I really feel as though I have total control of the car.

After 6,000 miles engine blew for no reason (new engine put in but covered under warranty), clutch went after 7,000 miles (maybe that was the wife driving??).  Now the convertible roof has stopped working and is currently in the shop getting fixed. With all that I still love this car."

porsche,boxster,2006,G Kemp Lipscomb, 05/17/2018,Finance it for 5 years. Keep it for Life!,5,"Buying a pre-owned 987 Porsche Boxster or Cayman can easily turn into an automotive love affair. The build quality is outstanding, fully capable of clocking 200-300,000 miles. And the driving experience will make you want to reach that number sooner versus later! Be careful. Changing oil and filter on schedule is an absolute necessity. And the dreaded intermediate shaft bearing (IMSB) failure is a remote but real issue with older Boxsters (not so much the 2006 MY, which features a larger, more heavy-duty sealed IMS bearing). MY 2009 and newer Boxsters do not have an IMSB, so there is no risk of major engine issues.

It is a true dream to drive - its smooth shifting and hydraulic clutch make it easy in traffic. The steering is precise and responsive. Its handling is excellent. It's not eye-poppingly fast but still very quick and inspiring.  The brakes are powerful. This car has a LOT of trunk space. One in the back and one in the front, you can use it for groceries even!  It's a little cramped inside but I am 6'2"" and I fit fine. The interior is just right. I strongly suggest the full leather option. Power seats are not necessary for this car. The build quality is excellent, as Porsche uses only high quality parts which equates to low maintenance. I got it for only $40,000 and it has a $52,000 MSRP. Get one NOW!"
porsche,boxster,2006,Cricket, 02/19/2010,First impressions,4,"Just drove the car 1700 miles in 3 days, so here's my first impression: This car is a blast to drive.  I have a couple pet-peeves already, but I have no regrets about my purchase!"

This is my first Boxster and third Porsche (two 911s previously)...and I no longer consider the Boxster as a step down from a 911...it's its own amazing car."
porsche,boxster,2006,B L, 05/18/2009,"Too little, for too much",3,"I traded in my Audi A4 for a Porsche Boxter.  I got an automatic with the sport package along with the premium package.  It has been a fun car to have but the oil changes are $700.00 every 20,000 miles, and the Bridgestone tires wore out in 18,00 miles which were $1,500 dollars to replace.  The interior is cheap for a Porsche, but the sounds system is awesome (Bose)."
porsche,boxster,2006,pbschroeder, 06/12/2008,Best combination of handling and speed,4,"We've had this car for about a year and a half.  It is relatively fast, very comfortable and handles great.  We had an '01 Boxster, which was a VW compared to this.  It is not as fast as some other cars, but the handling more than makes up for it."
porsche,boxster,2006,Robert, 10/11/2005,Pure FUN!,5,"Rock solid fun! This car has more than enough power to throw you back in your seat as you zoom around town, and the handling enables you to never take your foot off the gas. It has an interior that is larger than most of its peers, important to those of us with above average height, and a ride to go with this no-toy feel. Test drive on a real world street with lots of turns and opportunities to punch it and you will be hooked. Bring your check book!"
porsche,boxster,2006,David, 01/19/2006,A Totally New Boxster That Will Thrill,5,"This is my second Boxster and fourth Porsche.  My last one was a 2002 that was great but this 2006 is a totally different car.  I am more impressed with this car than any I have ever owned, including a new BMW Z4 3.0 that I bought last March (2005).  The interior is much higher quality that previous years.  The car ""breathes"" as you accelerate with the silky smooth 5 speed transmission.  The Bose stereo is exceptional!  The price was a true value.  I highly recommend this car with great enthusiasm."
porsche,boxster,2006,FurnitureGuy, 06/08/2006,"Fun, fun, fun, fun..........",4,"I traded in my BMW 330 for this great machine - passing up the BMW Z4.  All it took was one test drive and I was hooked.  Driving the twisties is as fun in this car as it is on my motorcycle!  Top down, wind in my hair, the sweet music of the exhaust - could you ask for more?   The BMW was comfortable, but this car rocks!  We get a little bit of rain here in Oregon, so not having to stop to put up the top when it sprinkles is a plus."
porsche,boxster,2006,Claude, 01/20/2007,Highly Recommended!,4,"This is my second Boxster S so I'm very happy with the styling, handling, and performance. The cost of options is ridiculous. Plus there is a long wait time for ""exclusive"" options. Beware that options don't appreciably improve resale value so select them carefully. Some options should have been standard such as automatic climate control. The second generation Boxsters (Starting with the'05 model) are greatly improved in almost all ways. I wasn't expecting much difference from my '01 S but was amazed how much improved the '06 S was - certainly enough to compel me to pay the cost of upgrading. Beware that the residual value for used Boxsters is lower than 911s. This could be expensive if you don't intend to keep the car."
porsche,boxster,2006,Craig Dickinson, 01/24/2007,Tight and Nimble,4,"This car seems to be well thought out with easy to see displays and a trip computer that provides exceptional trip information.  It is fast off the mark, smooth at speeds over 70 mph, and sticks to corners like glue.  I use for business trips <250 miles.  The two trunks are still small, but I find that, with creativity, all needed items can be stored.  The two coat hooks on the back of the seats let me store my suit coat.  The seating positioning is comfortable, but only for those who are 6 feet tell and under.  I suggest adding protective coating (option) to protect front and wheel areas from nicks from stones, etc..  I have put 2,300 miles on mine in 10 days, enjoying the journey as much as destination!  Buy it!"
porsche,boxster,2006,TomK17, 10/26/2007,After One Full Year of Driving,4,"Just completed one full year of driving my 2006 Boxster so here is a quick assessment.  Car is not a daily driver for me so miles are limited.  Car drives very well, not as harsh as you might think.  I have the 17"" wheels which may add to that.  To me, the 17s offer a more ""big rubber"" back tire look as opposed to the 18"" wheels with a short sidewall.  Handling difference is negligible.  Build quality has been very good, no problems, no squeaks / rattles just like you would expect with a new car!  Long maintenance terms, factory says first oil change at 20K miles so even if you chicken out and go 15K it's still a long time.  Car gets a lot of looks - hopefully resale will be good as well. "

It corners very well and is fast. The 18"" wheel makes you feel you are glued to the road. The two trunks are the biggest you can find in all convertible. The seat is pretty comfortable. If you are ever thinking about buying a Porsche, don't think any more, go get one ASAP. You only live once, do I have to say any more?"
porsche,boxster,2006,David, 01/29/2017,Don't buy this car unless you have deep pockets,2,"I bought this car with 30k  miles on it in 2013 and it now has 46500 miles.  I have put over $12,000 dollars into it in repairs and maintenance alone.  I don't get where  Edmunds get the price of repair in the Denver area but it is no where near reality.  The dealer charges 150 dollars an hour for labor and the sparks plugs a piece are $18 dollars.  Even independents are the same if  not higher.  The dealer told me I needed a tie rod replacement which is over $2000 but I took it to an independent shop and it did not need it.  The Porsche dealer was just trying to create work.  I take it to the independent from now on he seems to be honest and does not do anything unnecessary.  I finally solved the smoking problem.  They fixed a vacuum leak on my  brakes line and the smoking went away except for when the car sits.  The Dealer had no clue and told me that is the way the cars are.

porsche,boxster,2006,db65, 02/21/2008,New one,4,"I previously owned a '99 blk on blk Boxster in '04.  That car blew an engine at 72k miles that cost me $12k to replace.  Due to my passion (possible stupidity) I traded in for a '06 Arctic Silver Boxster fully loaded.  So far, I have finally had the Porsche experience but miss some of the 986 raw elements.  The new '06 is more refined and had the gadgets but lacks some of the 986 prowlness and agility.  Overall, the Boxster can't be beat. Buy one and see for yourself what fun you can have."
porsche,boxster,2006,Mitch, 09/25/2005,Boxster Fun,4,The Boxster is a fun to drive car.  I have an automatic.  The ride is firm and it hugs the road.The top is a breeze to put down and the windows lower when ever you open the door or put the top down. It gets manny a looks by other drivers and it has get up and go with a push of the pedal. This is such a great car that we ordered a second one for my wife . 
porsche,boxster,2006,jcntsl, 02/24/2006,"Awesome, Awesome Car",4,"I just bought an '06 Boxster with the six speed transmission... and I have to say I have never driven anything as balanced as this car. I will tell you the ride is stiff with the optional 19 inch wheels, but well worth the look and the price. The handling is like nothing I have ever driven. Prior to this car, I had an Audi TT convertible, and before that I had a Porsche 911 coupe. Overall this is the most fun I've had in a convertible. I would highly recommened getting the base Boxster with the optional six speed transmission. The acceleration difference is almost negligable over the S model, and the price savings is substantial. Overall I paid $54,500 for a Boxster with similar performance to the Boxster A."

porsche,boxster,2006,Ben, 07/06/2006,Great Car,4,"Folks who claim this car is a chore around town are just wrong. This car is no more difficult to drive around town than ANY other small car with a manual transmission. And the fun factor on this one wins out every time.  There are faster cars out there, but overall the Boxster's performance at this price is a huge plus, not to mention that you don't see Porsches on every corner like other cars in the same price range."
porsche,boxster,2006,Frank, 08/09/2006,Porsche Boxster,5,"This car is very fun to drive, just a slight push on the gas petal tells you why...The first scheduled maintenance is two years or 20,000 miles...Can you believe that!  Oil changes every 20K no way...The dealer advised not to drive it over 120 mph during the first 2,000 miles for brake in..Holy cow...That is as fast as you need to be on U.S.A. roads"

porsche,boxster,2006,martini4me, 11/16/2005,Guaranteed Fun! Does Not Disappoint!,4,"Purchased a 2006 base Porsche Boxster with Tiptronic a couple of weeks ago.  The driving experience is great!  The engine is pleasantly loud.  I've found it quietest at about 65 mph, louder at low speeds in the 10-30mph range and fairly loud at 75 mph+.  If you're looking for a sports convertible in the $50,000 - $60,000 range, look no further.  The storage room is great with the front and rear trunks.  I can get 2 sets of golf clubs in the rear (even with top down) and a nice sized medium piece of luggage in the front.  That's better than the BMW 3-Series or Audi A4 convertible, which, with top down would require using the whole back seat for storage as well.  I put the top down at 55-60 degrees with the heat on, no problem!"

porsche,boxster,2006,R. Anderson, 05/12/2006,A Tip Of The Hat To Porsche's Engineers,5,"Wow - The new Porsche Boxster S is an absolutely awesome machine. Porsche's engineers have combined body styling suitable for an art museum with the best mechanical engineering I have ever seen in an automobile.  With the mid engine design and tiptronic auto/manual transmission even an average driver can feel like a NASCAR driver. This car is easy and fun to drive. You would think the car is mounted on rails when making sharp turns at, shall we say, excessive speeds.  Porsche's engineers have designed the ultimate practical fun sports car. My girlfriend and I find the cabin very comfortable during 2 1/2 hour back road trips. The S combines awsome power great stability and superb brakes."

Its top of world handling capabilities, more than decent power, elegant German design, and superior build quality make this sports car THE car to measure all other ""pretenders"" by! This is my second Boxster...we owned an '04 and enjoyed that one before getting this new model.  All of the improvements Porsche has made were for the better...except for their BOSE audio system...which was cheapened for some reason?  My old car's BOSE system sounded much better by comparison. But who cares?  Turn off the radio and listen to the exhaust note!  That's what I'm talkin' about! "
porsche,boxster,2006,Kent Weimer, 04/23/2017,Fun on the run!,4,"What a fun car to drive.  Shifting the manual transmission is easy and fast with tight, short. precise movements.  This car will get up to really fast, really fast.  The driving position can be highly controlled with the seat adjustments and tilting and telescoping steering wheel.  When done right, it feels like I'm wearing the car. This is not an economy car.  It requires premium gasoline and maintenance is expensive. The driving pleasure is well worth it though. Putting the top down and hearing the sound of that distinctive Porsche motor makes the world a better place. Someone asked if I was going through my second childhood.  I said I never left my first. My whole life I've owned several convertibles and sports cars.  This is the best yet!

Mine wound up needing work on the top lowering mechanism ($ 1200) which could have been avoided had I raised and lowered the top before buying it.  It also needed gas pistons (they hold up the trunk lids) for both front and rear lids (not expensive but annoying).  Maintenance costs on this car are NOT trivial (oil change with filter about $ 200).  There is no navigation unit or bluetooth in the car, so you will need to use your cellphone or buy a new unit ($ 800 to 1500) if you want these things.  Trunks are very spacious.  Steering and handling are superb.  Despite some drawbacks, overall a fun car to drive !

It has a sweet exhaust note, terrific performance, and it is stunning from all angles. I completed my first autocross event and was amazed at how good this car is. The steering, braking, and handling were astonishing. I couldn't get the back end to break loose and believe me I tried! For a fun day find a windy road, drop the top, turn up the Bose stereo, and just blast through the gears. This car is a great stress reliever after a long day in the office. I chose 18"" wheels due to the terrible road surfaces here in the Northeast because the 19's tend to have a slightly harsher ride."
porsche,boxster,2006,Greg Zoghby, 02/24/2006,Best all around sports car.,5,"I have had my  2006 Porsche Boxster S for less than a month.  I test drove the Lotus Elise and the Honda S2000 side by side with the Boxster S.  I can truely say it is a very livable, yet unbelievable car.  I drive it every day.  The space is excellent and it is a comfortable dayly driver.  The car fits better than any car I have sat in.  The brakes are stunning and the steering is great.  I will take it for its first track date in two months (to Virginia International Raceway) and I am sure it will not disappoint.  I will update this after that.  This is the best all around sports car made."

I am also impressed with the Bose surround system."
porsche,boxster,2006,Chris C, 04/09/2006,Best pure sports car anywhere,5,"Porsche has finally given the Boxster its own terrific style and the performance it deserves. This car has unequalled handling, the best braking and slalom times in magazine tests, usable cargo space, amazing seats and upmarket interior, drop dead roadster style ala Carrera GT.  For me the Boxster S is so good it is a steal compared to the base Carrera Cab at $30,000 more! Its quality has been excellent, service is reasonable...but buy it for the pure sports car driving experience. I traded a BMW M3 on my 987S because some German cars have forgotten that less weight is more fun than more hp.  Porsche has the perfect recipe for performance, style and prestige with the new Boxster! "
porsche,boxster,2006,lakeman, 07/06/2006,Awesome Sports Car,5,"I was looking for the best handling, convertible sports car I could afford and I found it. The Boxster is awesome. I tested and reviewed BMWs, MBs, Mustangs and Miatas, new and used. I also looked at older Boxsters, but the moment I tested the new Boxster I knew it was the perfect car for me. The 2006 base Boxster has a much nicer interior, better sound system with the Bose (crucial as an audiophile), and with 18"" wheels appeared faster than the 2004 S I had tested. The unexpected features that I like are how the top can be raisied and lowered at speeds under 30 with one touch, the surprisingly good fuel economy of 28 mpg, the comfortable ride for a sports car, and most importantly the excellent build quality."

It surpasses a car I didn't think could be surpassed!  It has exceptional handling, total control, and an exquisite ride (for 18"" wheels).  This car does it all and leaves the competition in the dust!  The ""S"" model delivers the high power some of you may require...but the regular Boxster is a driver's ""dream come true!"" The Japanese manufacturers wish they could make a car drive like this one!  The American's don't even bother to try.  What a roadster.

porsche,boxster,2007,Texas Porsche Guy, 10/11/2006,2007 Boxster,4,"I use to own an older '86 911 and always looked at the Boxster as a toy car and was not impressed.  I recently went looking to buy a fun ragtop and was planning to spend $40,000 - $50,000 to buy a used 911 Cab, SL500, SLK, or a new Vette (go figure, I liked the look). I reviewed them and threw out the SL500 for being too expensive (I wanted an '03 or newer).  I did not like how the SLK350 drive felt.  A 911 Cab for $50,000 meant a '91 - '92 model, so for fun I drove a new Boxster. It was faster than my 911 and it drove much better. The Vette was  nice but just wasn't my style and I can't explain that. The Boxster drives great and the Bose stereo is a must. If you love driving and listening to music then this is the best vehicle there is for the money."
porsche,boxster,2007,bb, 08/14/2009,The perfect roadster.,4,"It is nearly impossible to stop smiling when driving this engaging car. The precise, responsive handling and cornering ability are superb.  The 245 hp base engine provides plenty of power and torque when kept in the right RPM bands.  It excels on twisty side roads, but is a fairly comfortable highway cruiser.  Front and rear trunks provide surprising capacity.  No problems whatsoever after 2-1/2 years of varied driving. I never want to drive anything else."

I have had the base model 2007 Boxster for 3 months/ 7000 miles.


I have had no mechanical issues with the car.
I did have to replace the front brakes and rear main seal but that is to be expected in a used Boxster of this age.


The black leather interior is quite nice, there are
no cracks even at 50K miles.
Interior comfort features are somewhat as space is at a premium.
Build quality, fit and finish are better than I expected.

It has been a great all around experience so far, from the dealership to Porsche follow ups after sale. The car itself is fantastic to drive. It is not as powerful as my Audi S4 or the Corvette, but I have had a much more thrilling driving experience. The 245 HP is plenty powerful enough and the handling is first class.  The engine note is great, the cars a real head turner and the fit and finish are everything you'd expect in a Porsche. The other, less obvious plus for me, is the cargo space. I can get a golf bag in the rear trunk and two airline overhead compartment sized cases in the front trunk. "

I test drove a Vette but once I got behind the wheel of the Porsche Boxster and put it through its paces, I was sold. I drove both the Boxster's standard and S models and the other Porsche, top of the line, models and after comparing the price differences and only driving the Boxster on weekends ( I only have 4500 miles on it) I felt the standard model Boxster was fine with me. For an old guy the Boxster is everything I could want and more!"
porsche,boxster,2007,Porsche Nut, 03/09/2010,Perfect Sports Car,5,"My bride and I ordered this car in June of 2006 as our wedding gift to each other.  Even though we bought the ""base"" Boxster, we optioned it up with all the goodies including the hardtop to a list of $67000!  We got the base as it has plenty of power, great performance and really does get over 30 mpg on the highway.  It is great for tooling around the backroads of Pennsylvania, Virginia, West (by God) Virginia and Maryland and can hold enough luggage for a week and still have room left for making frequent stops at the wineries!  The overall performance is superb.  I have owned Alfas, Fiats, Lancias, Triumphs and nothing compares to the Porsche.  Expensive yes, but well worth it."
porsche,boxster,2007,Matt Mitchell, 12/21/2016,Great Handling Piece Of German Engineering-2007,5,"I bought the car as a CPO in 2015 with a 2 year warranty and sold it recently before the warranty expired.  Bought it with 59,000 miles and immediately had to soak another $2k in it for the major service.  I paid $30,000 (going price at the time) and resold for only $19,000 (going price), a big depreciation hit for less than 2 years ownership.  It was one of the best cars I have ever driven,  acceleration, handling and breaking are second to none.  Would I buy the car again?  No, the depreciation and upkeep is no Bueno.  If I had the money to do it all over again, probably would do the 911 cabrio.  My biggest problem is now buying my replacement sports car, everything I test drive is compared to the Porsche.  Nothing compares.

porsche,boxster,2007,Mike Buglioli, 05/12/2019,Worth the wait,5,"I bought my Porsche Boxster used. I studied every competitor over several years and the Boxster just kept coming up on top, price, value, reliability, performance and of course fun. I'm 60. I've owned over 100 cars, mostly American or Japanese, and none of these cars compare to the Boxster. Not even close. This is the ultimate roadster in every way. Just a precision built car. There is no comparison. Sure you can pay more for more exotic cars but for the price and what you get, buy a Boxster. I'm glad I waited and glad I went with the Boxster. Thank you Richard Hammonds.

porsche,boxster,2007,greg, 09/28/2008,rides on rails,4,"This is a great car.  It's not that fast but it handles like nothing else.  Seems to be on rails and takes corners 10 times better than anything I've driven.  I only get 20 mpg and that was with conservative driving before my 2000 mile break-in period.     The paint chips very easily, more easily than any car I've had.  And the seats are extremely narrow at the shoulders.  If fact, they hurt and I'm considering some after market seats. Seems you have to be a skinny teenager to fit in the seats.  But overall it's a thrill to drive down winding roads."
porsche,boxster,2007,aa, 05/16/2007,"Great car, but problems",4,"I am now on my second Boxster S. I traded in my 2001 for this current model. I love driving the car, I like the exhaust note a lot more than my previous one, it handles great etc. Funny thing just happened, I started to notice a clanking sound from the front left. I took it to the dealer twice and apparently there is a problem with some sort of pressure line in the power steering system. It apparently is a problem that Porsche has been aware of on these new models as well as the Caymans, but there is no repair solution. Because it is apparently not a safety concern I can't lemon the car. So now I have a car that is fun to drive except for that hideous noise from the front... go figure."
porsche,boxster,2007,topoff, 05/30/2007,Fun to drive when not in the shop,4,"In the 4 weeks I've owned the car, it's been in the shop 4 times and going back again.  Indicators showed low tire in the first 3 days of purchase.  Had to buy a new tire.  Wind noise around side windows, then controller went out for auto up driver window.  While fixing that, they disconnected door side light.  Dealer doesn't carry parts, so it's always 2 trips for repair.  BMW Z4 wasn't in shop this much in 3 years I leased it.  But fun to drive when I have it.  If this keeps up, next review will be titled ""piece of crap.""  Evidently lots of understanding needed for intricasies of the brand."
porsche,boxster,2007,GmanMD, 10/09/2006,What a Driving Experience!,4,"I have now owned this car for two days and all I can say is wow.  It is a head-turner, it drives beautifully, and it just keeps bringing a smile to my face.  This car is just fun."
porsche,boxster,2007,chemprof98, 07/21/2008,Inexpensive super car,4,"If you like to drive, then this is the car.  Handling, speed and responsiveness are unparalleled.  Had a MB SLK 280 and 240.  Cute car but nothing like this.  While you can't legally get to 150, this car will do it easily and quickly.  A blast to drive and a strangely satisfying sound to listen to as you drive.  Great purchase."
porsche,boxster,2007,Cindy, 05/28/2009,Great car!,4,"It handles like a sports car, but has a very smooth ride. I still can't believe the power in acceleration. I traded in a Mazda Miata, so this is quite a step up. It functions very well as an everyday car, and the storage space is a bonus. This is certainly a car you can take on a weekend with luggage. There are so many features including an onboard computer that it may be months before I know the full potential of this vehicle. The downside (or upside depending on your perspective) is I'll probably never buy any other car than a Porsche."
porsche,boxster,2007,Franko , 06/20/2007,A Great Little Car,5,"I bought this car 11/06, it was a special order and now has 7000 miles on it.  Prior to this I owned a Mazda Miata, prior to that a Triumph TR3B, before that a MG-TD.  So far I have had no problems what so ever, it has been a great little car.  My car has standard seats, which are fine, and navigation which is useful but expensive."
porsche,boxster,2007,Allen Ownby, 07/08/2019,Great Car One Problem in 9 years,4,"Very reliable car, A joy to drive. The one problem is, the release buttons for the two trunks are electric. If the battery dies you cannot get into the trunk to get to the battery. There is an emergency trunk cable release behind the drivers front tire but you would need a lug wrench to get the wheel off which is IN THE TRUNK! There is also a place to connect jumper cables in the fuse panel but if the battery is completely dead it will not help."
porsche,boxster,2007,metroflyer, 07/29/2008,A car that puts a smile on my face,5,"I've had the car since new and have done nothing but enjoy it.  It is great fun to drive, I almost always drive on side roads and not the freeway, just keeps the rocks and debris off the front end.  The car handles great, feels like it is on rails when going around sharp corners. I am getting very good gas mileage, close to 30, keeping the RPM down helps. "
porsche,boxster,2007,Sammy, 07/25/2019,Nice but no WOW,3,"Boxter handled as one expects for a Porsche.  There was no pizzazz to the car.  Automatic convertible top was excellent.  Did not WOW me as did Prorshe 911 Carrera S.

I still only have 250 miles on it (picked it up with 6), but it puts a smile on my face every time I start it up. The car draws plenty of attention, and even though it's far from broken in (I'm trying my best to keep the RPM's under 5,000), the car is a real blast to drive. I even enjoy it on my lousy commute up/down the congested Rt. 7 here in N. Virginia, and if you know anything about Rt. 7 during rush hour, that should tell you something about the car!"

I hoped and was successful combining the best features of each car with the Boxster S.  It's an all out blast to drive.  Quick, nimble, powerful, classic good looks and with great exhaust sound.  It loves winding mountain roads and hates logging trucks!  Get the factory short throw shifter if you really love driving."
porsche,boxster,2008,Jeff, 02/28/2009,"If you can afford one, buy one",4,"I have owned my 2008 Boxster S for about 8 months and I am truly impressed.  I can't believe the handling, power, styling and just how much fun it is to drive at any speed!  I will sometimes just walk out into my garage and stare at this beautiful car.  I have a black model with the tan interior, gorgeous.  It is a real head turner when clean and shined up. The red calipers on the S are worth the price from a ""wow"" factor.  I just walked through a Porsche showroom again last week and can't really see the reason to pay for more than the Boxster S delivers unless you are a professional driver.   "

Sour-grapers sneer, ""What's up with the..."" or ""Who drives an ORANGE car?"", but there's no question this baby is a head-turner - more so than the PD or the Spyder. Folks at work I never talked to stop by for chats, strangers walk up wanting to know the name of the color, and little boys run after me in my hood shouting ""I LOVE your car!"". But that's vanity - what you experience behind the wheel is inSANity! I've named her my ""joy toy""!"
porsche,boxster,2008,Slick Shift, 10/17/2009,There is no subsitute,4,"Replacing my aging s2000 was difficult. Buying the RS60 was easy. There was no comparison. Price of admission was high, but the Porsche selectable suspension system coupled with smooth kick in the pants engine power, killer brakes, handling, and selectable exhaust makes an enthusiast dream come though. The car felt like home immediately. Rare and beautiful gray interior and that classic exterior makes my tail wag when the garage door opens. At 6 ft plus plenty of room and comfort. Bose system sounds very good when I am not listening to that beautiful exhaust note. Fit and finish is fantastic and having two trunks is even better. Ride comfort superb. It is a sensational auto that is a blast."
porsche,boxster,2008,new porsche lover, 06/06/2008,A little slice of heaven,4,"I have never had a more enjoyable car.  Never having owned a sports car, as I drove it off the lot I wondered if I would grow tired of the sports car feel and handling.  After half a year, the answer is a resounding no!  Never have I been behind the wheel of a more responsive, powerful, or elegant machine.  Aside from initial confusion over the radio controls, I have no complaints.  The handling is magnificent, and she brakes on a dime.  What you want, she does.  I have had no major problems from a reliability standpoint, and for my purposes, the amount of storage is more than adequate for a car of this type.  Heaven, indeed, and worth every Penny."
porsche,boxster,2008,Jared, 10/03/2008,Perfection,5,"There is no such thing as the perfect car, as I found out by going through 25 of them in 7 years. At least that is what I thought until this car. If you are considering a sports car and a Boxster is in your budget then you absolutely must drive one. I have owned cars that were faster in a straight line (2 Vipers, 4 Corvettes, and an 03 Mustang Cobra), but none of them felt the way this car does. The smoothness of this car is just flat out incredible. It does everything so well, and I can't really describe it, but it just feels good no matter what kind of driving you are doing. Of course it is at its best when you are doing aggressive driving on your favorite curvy road. Yes it is perfect."
porsche,boxster,2008,Scott, 04/08/2009,Yeow,5,"Stunning looks and performance to match.  Sold my 2001 Boxster to get this one. The RS60 is light years ahead.  I was surprised at the amount of improvement over what I thought was an already outstanding vehicle.  The RS has the 303hp engine and it goes like a scalded cat.  Passed my wife on the interstate at xxx mph and she said it sounded like we were at the racetrack. Handling is scarcely believable, especially in sport mode.  Acceleration is unexpectedly strong, like being tied to the space shuttle.  It's a little slippery on wet roads, but stable unless you do something seriously juvenile. The brakes: phenomenal, really kind of otherworldly in their ability to get you to zero in a hurry."
porsche,boxster,2008,James, 05/12/2009,One Beautiful Sports Car,4,Just got this car and stayed up half the night driving it around with the top down. It feels so good with the top down. The handling is top notch.  You can feel the quality built into this car. Drove the 370z and even though it had more bells and whistles it wasn't near as fun to drive as the Boxster S. Plus chicks love a Porsche and that alone is worth the extra coin.

Being a long time car buff it is one of the nicest cars I have ever owned and I have had many.  The Boxster handles very well and you will want to find every curvy road in your area to experience the handling of the car.   Comfort is good and even though I am 6'2"" I still fit pretty well.  The interior is top notch and very easy to use.  The exterior is typical Porsche...SEXY.   Bought my Boxster used and it only had 14k miles on the odo.

There is no need to go for the ""S"" model, stay with 18"" wheels.The car is perfect in every way. Excellent heat, cold in ct. I drive it in 40 degree weather and am very warm. Get the wind stop however. The finish, build quality is beyond BMW, last car was a 2006 mz4. The ride is comfortable at 80 mph on interstate or 30 mph around town. The two trunks carry everything a normal person would carry, I even put my backpack  leaf blower in trunk. As far as visual it is a breathtaking auto from all angles. Watch out for ""racers,"" they always want to race you. Smile and let them go, your car is a joy."

The changes I noticed were the seats were a bit more conforming (and no I didn't gain weight), and the shifting was a bit looser than the 05 (the 05 had a tighter shifting ratio). I have to get used to it because every time I go into what I think is 3rd it is 5th. I love the feel and look of the car and the ride.  The gas mileage is respectable and even though I spend tons of money on a car, I still hate paying high gas prices.   Whether you buy a Boxster or a 911, you have that Porsche prestige.  "

porsche,boxster,2008,Jim, 01/28/2009,Too much fun,5,Went to the local Porsche dealer to look at a used 95 Ferrari and spotted a Boxster S on the floor.  I decided to take it for a spin and it now sits in my garage waiting for Spring.  These cars are definitely built with the driver in mind.  I doubt if there is a car made that is more well- balanced than a Boxster S.

It handles likes its on rails and sounds so good that I'm always turning down the $1000 upgraded Bose stereo down so I can hear the 3.4 growl. I love going anywhere now. Haven't said that in a while.  This is my daily driver and with the traffic here in town chose the triptronic. I never thought that I would be saying this but I am so glad I went with the Auto. Its like driving a high tech video game. Flying around corners and shifting is a blast. I can also be holding hands with my date and still drive the car like it should be driven.

The design, performance, fit&finish, and overall driveability are phenomenal. The sport exhaust is absolutely AWESOME!!. I love driving this baby through tunnels with the top down--the sound just stirs the soul! Many you tube videos exist that give nice reviews of the car, but for some reason none really capture the sound all that well. You really have to drive it to hear and feel it adequately.

porsche,boxster,2008,majormcf, 04/20/2008,Boxster review,5,"Car is awesome and perfect balance of handling and power.  I had the first generation boxster and this one is twice the car and I had no complaints with the first one.  If you're going to buy one get at least a 12% discount off sticker or go to another dealer. My dealer was supposed to set the locks and headlights and failed to do so.  Since I didn't buy it locally I will have to pay a couple hundred bucks out of my pocket for not checking.  They also quoted me 50.00 on the tint and then charged me 139.00. Not a big deal but as a repeat customer I expected more, probably will by my next Porsche from someone else."
porsche,boxster,2008,driver, 05/09/2008,a great drive,5,"Truly this has to be one of the world's great automobiles. Driving this car on public streets makes one feel sensational. I can only, at this time, imagine how great the car is going to be when I get it on a track at a Porsche driving school. The five speed transmission is a bit of a drawback but that's because I am used to a six speed. Pay up for the six speed if you can, either in the base as an option or in a Spyder or Boxster S. Go for the 18 inch wheels too. Try for the 12% discount like the other guy said, but in reality be happy to get 5%. Definitely shop the car among other dealers but supply does look a bit low.  Enjoy!"
porsche,boxster,2009,HoustonOwner, 10/18/2009,"Fun to drive, exhilaration, hesitation",5,"I've had my 2009 Boxster for about a month.  I love the car but I'm having an issue with hesitation.  The dealer's computer doesn't find any problems with the engine, but the car clearly hesitates sometimes.  I'm not sure if the problem is with the PDK.  It feels more like a problem with fuel injection.  It's very annoying.  From a dead stop when I press the gas pedal, I want the car to GO, not sputter and cough.  What's the deal Porsche?"
porsche,boxster,2009,johnc8551, 01/17/2012,Rock solid dependable awesome fun!,4,"This is the best balanced car I've ever owned with no handling faults I can even think of. It's just an all around fun car to drive and care for. Oil changes and other maintenance is a bit expensive, but the maintenance intervals are spaced far enough apart that although each service is rather expensive ($450+), they don't come often enough to be excessive - especially for a car of this level. Like a loyal hunting dog, it just begs to go and play every time I walk into the garage.

No unscheduled problems, so far with 32K miles on the odo."
porsche,boxster,2009,SGT TS HUTTEN, US ARMY SF,KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE PARK,5,"Porsche really knocked the 987.2 out of the park! A super highlight is the 7-speed manual/auto transmission. I searched the country for specific features that were of most interest to me; driving it home from TX to FL was a thrill!  Power, handling, agility, shifting, cornering and braking combine for a spectacular package that fits a 6'1"", 200 lb. man specifically. I've owned dozens of high-end, exotic sports cars over the years. Given Porsche's 911 engine flaw in recent years, one might argue that the Cheyenne may actually have saved them from financial ruin.  When I hear or see ""Porsche"" I think sports car - not SUV.  That said, I'd submit that it was the Boxster that saved Porsche.

porsche,boxster,2010,Bailey, 09/21/2010,Stellar. Wow. Great only car for 2.,4,"This car has been a revelation.  The build quality, design, and performance consistently and continuously impress.  This car is something special.  This is our only car.  We have rely on it to perform all missions under all conditions.  After 4 months, 8000 miles, and a few multi-day road trips, we have no regrets.  It is comfortable, capable, safe, well designed, beautifully made and finished, and does everything.  Golf clubs fit.  Luggage for 2 fits easily.  Go-crazy shopping trips, speed bumps, steep driveways, dirt roads and rain are no problem.  The Porsche Boxster adds an element of beauty and excitement and beauty to everyday life that everyone should experience."
porsche,boxster,2010,David S, 10/02/2018,Many Miles of Smiles,5,"My 2010 Base Boxster is an unusual car in many ways.  It has a surprising amount of storage both inside the car (six compartments worth inside since I don't have Bose but I do have SPP and no CD changer), two trunks, and an auxiliary storage box in the front.  All this storage makes the car so much easier to live with from a practical perspective.  The “fronk” will hold two legal airplane rollies...and you still have a large (though shallow) trunk in the back for duffels and other squishy stuff.  The only downsize is that you can’t put large hard-framed items inside the car (such as a 24” x 36” picture)....but how often do you need that capability?  It’s a strange review that starts off lauding a Porsche convertible for its storage capabilities, but that’s just one thing setting this series (987.2) apart certainly from other convertibles and even from newer Boxsters.  My Boxster also has European tri-colored tail lights, which is a huge plus to me (it’s a thoughtful safety touch).  

OK.  Let’s get down to business:  This is a Porsche and it’s all about handling and acceleration and braking...and naturally the Porsche excels in all three areas, even with this Base Boxster.  By modern standards, the car is relatively slow (0-60 in 5.4sec).  The 2.9L flat six sounds glorious when revved (in contrast, the 2.0T4 in the new Boxster sounds like a cross between an air-cooled VW and a Subaru 4).  However, the PFI 2.9L isn’t the engine of choice if you want real speed:  That belongs to the S models and its DFI 3.4L.  Still, the car is plenty speedy especially when you’re the only one in the car and keeps pulling past 65 MPH.  The handling, though, is truly telepathic.  Provided you have top quality rubber (Michelin PS4s or equivalent (I'm running on Pilot Super Sports), the car handles around corners like it’s on rails.  All handling and braking aspects spoil you for any other car.  Also pleasant:  The ride isn’t punishing.  Oh, no one will mistake the ride for that of a Mercedes S class, but your Subaru WRX/STi and Mitsubishi Lancer Evo friends will think they’re in a limo.  Every trip in this car is a pleasure, particularly with the PDK.  If I had to do it all over again, I might have opted for the S version and given up a bunch of vacations for the faster engine.  

About my Radio CDR30 + Sound Package Plus (SPP):  Replacing the radio from all accounts is an extremely difficult proposition because of the optic cable integration with the rest of the electronics.   Replacing the speakers is apparently an another headache-inducing OCD experience.  'Ya know:  The sound quality is adequate and on that basis I'm leaving things alone until something truly breaks.  Bluetooth integration with my new iPhone iOS 14.3 for making calls (initiated via Siri) is OK though Waze sometimes plays directions via Bluetooth on a random basis.  Apple CarPlay this isn't.  

Dec 2020 Pandemic Update:  So, it was time for some maintenance.  I was getting some growling noises in the power steering and thought it was time to check things out under the hood (or should I say mid-engine cowl cover).  After doing lots of research and watching a number of Youtube videos, I decided to add PS fluid (Pentosin), replace my engine air filter (Wix) and replace my cabin air filter in the fronk.  The process of taking off the engine cover was convoluted to say the least and required lots of careful planning and patience.  Adding Pentosin CHF 11S was easy; replacing the engine air filter was super tricky (it's all twists and turns)...I could have waited another 10k before doing it, so I was theoretically wasting money but the time/effort to get the engine cover off is so high, one might as well do as much maintenance as possible while under there.  I figure I saved at least $400 by doing this work myself.  The cabin air filter replacement was also tricky since there's four
 ridiculous overengineered Torx bolts + cage guarding that air filter, plus a not-well-thought-out wire harness nearby.  For anyone about to attempt this service, my strongest recommendation is that you a) watch every video you can, and b) before removing any screw/bolt, put a bunched-up towel under the next screw/bolt removal area to catch it if it falls...because if you lose one, you're toast.  Painstaking OCD inducing labor but that's what it takes to work on a Porsche.

porsche,boxster,2010,Tom B, 02/20/2010,Fun to Drive,5,I purchased by Boxter in October of 2009 and already have 5000 miles on it. I take it on trips and to work. I live in Reno and have a good number of days with the top down. My previous Boxter was a 2004 and there is no comparison. This car has all the power and acceleration I need and is a blast in the mountains around here.Also the top is quiet. In the 2004 there was considerable wind noise. Unlike my previous Boxter I have not had a single problem or complaint. Maybe the gas mileage could be a tad better but for the performance you get it is quite acceptable.
porsche,boxster,2010,KS, 07/20/2010,Any Porsche = Great Sports Car,4,"I had my Boxster 2.9 for about a month and I enjoy it with every drive. There is really something special about driving a Porsche considering its racing heritage and legendary 911 roots plotted in the Boxster, it's just a great fun cruiser Not a racing machine. In my opinion the manual 6spd transmission is the only way to go and the clutch/shifter feel is very precise, the gas pedal has way too much resistance for my taste, I am getting used to it though. Hill start assist is also something that takes getting used to, I prefer not to have it because on uphill traffic it could be very annoying. My previous car was 2007 Infiniti M45 and I really wanted a driver's car with style, Boxster was it!"
porsche,boxster,2010,Lead foot, 06/01/2010,The best roadster in it's class,4,"Just bought this car last week, fun to drive and super nice to look at. I'm most impressed by its speed, hugs the road on turns. I took few turns at high speeds, car responded beyond my expectations! 7-Speed Porsche Doppelkupplung is a blast. This car will turn heads."
porsche,boxster,2010,Surfinjoe, 08/04/2010,Go get one,5,"Wow, always wanted one and finally took the leap and it's well worth it. Handles well, PDK is just plain fun and with the top down, well, the sky's the limit. Just an outstanding vehicle."
porsche,boxster,2011,jaci, 10/16/2010,Along came a Spyder,5,"The back to basic Spyder is living up to its Best Handling Car in America status. Everything I expected and more. The car is not for everyone as Porsche readily admits, but it is a car for the purist. And it will not disappoint."
porsche,boxster,2011,Jim Dario, 11/14/2015,"For the money, maybe the best Porsche ever!",5,"Met a member of the Porsche racing team this past Summer at Watkins Glen, and asked him his thoughts on the 2011 Boxster Spyder. His response, ""Maybe my favorite Porsche ever...don't ever sell it, and if you do, Call me""

I think that says all you need to know!

porsche,boxster,2013,ghost1214, 09/04/2014,Best Sports Car on the Planet!,4,"So I decided I wanted a sports car.  looked at the BMW z4, Mercedes SLK and the Porsche Boxster.  There is no comparison, it's not even close....Box!  I test drove the 911 but it didn't have the same balance as the Box.  I ordered mine with the red leather interior, Agate Gray exterior and 6 speed manual.  I pull down the street heads are turning.  The car is quick. get on the highway with some curves it's all giggles.   I have never driven a car that was just so much spiritual fun.   corners are a blast.  be careful you will catch the car in front and you won't need to slow down because it lives for the curves.  No problem you have the best brakes on the planet.  ""there is no substitute"""
porsche,boxster,2013,clutchplate, 09/11/2012,One of the bettter Porsches of all time.,5,"This is my 11th Porsche with most being 911's. Always wanted a Boxster but never liked the way they looked until now. The 2013 is stunning in person and is one of the best handling cars you can buy. The base model doesn't have much low end torque so you need to keep the engine between 4500 and 7000 rpm's. It's plenty fast within that range but it brings the mpg to around 18 so you have to choose between power or mileage. You get 30 mpg as advertised with a very light foot. The handling is stupendous, cornering is quick and tight, the car feels glued to the road no matter how hard you push. My last car was a Lotus Elise, which had superb handling, the new Boxster could be better."
porsche,boxster,2013,gmg66, 03/08/2014,2013 Boxster S,4,"I've had my Boxster for about one year and have put 2,500 miles on it. The overall fit and finish, and build quality on the car is extremely high. I have not had any problems with it. It's a blast to drive. As another review stated, it is deceptively fast. I ordered my car with the 6MT and the shifting is the best of any car I've ever driven - the location and feel are just perfect. The handling surprised me -
the rear end slides out on fast corners but in a very controlled manner which just contributes to the fun to drive factor. Overall a great driving, very high quality, stunning looking car."
porsche,boxster,2013,ttibio, 07/26/2012,2013 Boxster S blue/blue roof/grey,4,"Took delivery late June to replace a 996. Pretty much fully loaded with PDK, Sport Chrono, etc. It is an excellent looking vehicle - I had ordered it sight-unseen in January but was not disappointed. Maybe a bit fussy versus the 991, but that is too much of a grand tourer now. Not really budget constrained, but do think that at $80k I paid, the base+6spd starts to look GREAT value. The PDK is incredibly snappy, steering/handling super sharp, etc. - its just as the reviewers reviewed it - an excellent driver all round. Not sure the interior is super luxe - bit plasticky if you look around a bit.

Anyway it gets an A-. Like it a lot and will keep it a long time I am sure. "
porsche,boxster,2013,smerdyakov, 08/24/2015,"Step on the gas, wipe that tear away!",5,"I traded a base Boxster for an S. I made the trade not because I wanted higher performance (although the S is significantly faster) but because I couldn't find a base car with the parking assist and sports chrono options that I wanted. I eventually found the car that I wanted at Porsche of Fayetteville, where I received outstanding assistance from Mr. Robert Lee.
The difference in feel between the base car and the S is remarkable. If one didn't know, one would think that they were entirely different cars instead of two variations on the same theme. This is the 10th Porsche that I have owned, and clearly the best of them all. 
I strongly suggest finding a good used car with a warranty. The MSRP on a well-optioned car will easily go into the mid-70's, and a used car will usually be available for much less. I also suggest using the preowned search feature on the Porsche website, which is how I found my car.
Porsche: there is no substitute!
Update after six months: there is still no substitute. I can't think of another sports car, regardless of price, that I would rather own.

porsche,boxster,2013,b volin, 01/03/2018,most fun,5,"this is my third Boxster having previously owning a 2008 Boxster, a 2007 Boxster s and now a 2013 s 6 speed.  this car is the Swiss army knives of sports cars having multiple personalities based on how its driven,  cruising along at 2500 rpm provides a comfortable and economical commute, however, dropping down 1 or 2 gears and winding the car out to its red line provides both a driving and auditory experience that few other cars can match.

porsche,boxster,2013,Chris F., 04/25/2016,I Smile Like a Kid When I Drive My Boxster S,4,"I have heard the ultimate test of a car's cool factor is the way kids respond...Well this car catches the eye of every kid I pass. The 2013 Boxster S is a phenomenal car. It is my first Porsche and now I understand what those who own one appreciate. Incredibly fast, excellent handling, superb braking and just plain fun. The comfort is good but not great, definitely not designed for long distances and I would not have this as a daily driver. Safety is excellent, my only ding here is outward visibility. With the top down it is okay but with the top up I almost need a ground guide.

Value I marked down due to maintenance costs and purchase price. The price for a nicely loaded Boxster S is not cheap when you consider it is really a second car. I would not hesitate to buy this car again and again. It is pure fun with the top down driving along Highway 1 or on a twisty mountain road.

porsche,boxster,2013,Jerry, 08/03/2019,Near perfect,5,"The 2013 Boxster still feels and smells new after over 6 years.  The paint, Racing Yellow, has held up with only a yearly wax job.  The key to keeping it factory fresh is yearly dealer service (oil changes) and a good car cover and garage.  I would advise bi-annual battery changes and brake fluid flush.  Other than that just enjoy driving one of the best handling cars ever.

porsche,boxster,2013,Boxster2013, 02/23/2020,7 Years of Happy,5,"We bought our Boxster S in January of 2013 and I still just stand and stare at it in the garage.  The deep blue with black top is a personal favorite but what still makes me love this car are the curves.  The car is sexy.  I like to watch is being driven almost as much as I like to be behind the wheel myself.  As far as reliability, the car gets a 5-star rating.  You couldn't ask for a more solidly built machine.  We've put about 20,000 miles on it and it's only needed regular maintenance.  So far so good.  Hope everyone gets a chance to drive one some day.  It's a blast!

porsche,boxster,2013,Zach Fowler , 03/29/2020,"Beautiful, reliable, & so much fun!",5,"I’ve owned a few sports cars previously: BMW M3 - 2003, Porsche Boxster S - 2007, and now my Porsche Boxster Base - 2013. The 981 is hands down the most fun I’ve ever had in any car besides off-roading in my Chevy Colorado ZR-2 (different type of fun). The car is a comfy cruiser below 3k RPMs, but kick down a couple of gears, hit the gas, and hear the H-6 engine put out one of the sweetest sounds you’ve ever heard! The Boxster isn’t the fastest car you can get for the cash, but it handles, responds, and makes you feel like you’re driving a car that is $100k more. Get a Corvette if you want straight line performance. Get the 981 if you want to have fun at any speed, around any curve, and classy feeling that comes with driving a Porsche. It really feels like you’re glued to the road when cornering hard and the PDK transmission has the smoothest, quickest gear changes I’ve ever seen in any car.

The car is truly beautiful. The 981 is far more aggressive looking than the previous generations, and looks more like a super-car than even some of the base 911s in my opinion. The interior is beautiful and spacious for a two seater. The front and back trunks provide enough storage for a couples weekend get away, or for grocery runs. It’s honestly a convenient car if you don’t have kids or animals that need to ride along :)

I couldn’t be happier that I ended up buying the 981 Boxster. I haven’t had any issues with it and am amazed I still feel myself smiling every time I drive it, even after all this time of ownership. I’ll never get rid of it.

Find a CPO approved 981 and just drive the heck out of it. You won’t want to drive anything else on a paved road.

porsche,boxster,2013,Four Porsches Later, 11/23/2020,A Hollywood Convertible,5,"I have owned four Porsches. Loved them all. Three out of four loved me back. Nothing is perfect but a sunny day driving a Boxster or a Boxster S convertible is awfully darn close. 

THE CASE FOR THE BOXSTER, BOXSTER S
This mid engine German car is super fun to drive. 
For two seat cars it has a bigger interior than many other roadsters.
Two smallish trunks can hold several bags of groceries or some medium size soft bags.
Ditto for tennis rackets but golf clubs not so much.
Top down visibility is good. 
Wind turbulence in the cabin is fairly calm
The base car is well equipped. The S model with the bigger engine is very well equipped. 
The Bose stereo with its 465 watts goes with any playlist you can imagine. 

THE CASE AGAINST THE BOXSTER, BOXSTER S
People six feet tall can squeeze in but they may not love it. 
Premium gas is required
Mobil One oil changes will be two hundred dollars. 
There is so much technology that can go wrong and need fixing. That will be expensive unless you buy a CPO car with a two year factory warranty. That includes roadside assistance and trip interuption. A pre purchase inspection by a good Porsche repair shop would be critical to allow you to know what kind of shape the car is in. 
Repairs are expensive
Maintenance is expensive
Tires are expensive. Two at a time. 
Black Porsches show every little smudge and swirl. 
Drive through car washes are not good for your car. The three bucket car wash is recommended by owners. 
Your car comes with big thick books by the same people who invented kindergarten. Consult them before heading to the repair shop. Attention to details is key with a Porsche. 
You are going to field a lot of questions about your car. A lot. 
Mustangs and Camaros will try to race you. A lot. 
You are going to volunteer to run errands in your car. A lot.











Driving on curvy roads will make you feel glad you picked this car. So will driving on straight roads because they are just that fun.

porsche,boxster,2013,anandnatrajan, 08/04/2013,2013 Boxster S,4,"I custom ordered a lightly optioned Boxster S with the 6MT. Only the premium package and Bose in Guards Red with a black interior along with red seat belts and the light design package. The model designation was deleted at no charge. The car was built and delivered in 2 months. Price, MSRP 67k and I was happy to get a 5% discount.

Gem of a car. Brilliant 6MT with easy shifting requiring no effort except fingertips. Clutch pedal felt a bit heavy at first but not anymore. Wonderful sounding engine although I haven't taken it past 5000 rpm. Very smooth and deceptive power. Extremely rapid acceleration and in the corners, the car is fantastic. Very strong brakes. "
porsche,boxster,2013,quierodormir, 10/26/2013,Real upgrade over the 987,4,"Just replaced my 2007 Boxster with the 2013. Its a real improvement in almost every way over the previous generation. 

The design of the exterior and interior are significantly enhanced (in particular the interior, which previously I felt had a tendency to feel cheap in terms of
materials)

I know the electric steering has received some criticism, but I cannot tell a difference with the old hydraulic setup. Both are fantastic opinion. 

The only minor difference I've noticed is that the exhaust note in the 2013 isn't as pronounced as the 2007 at lower RPMs. This may be due to the fact that my '07 had the sport / PASM package while the new one doesn't."

Something larger and more practical was in order.
Not another two seat roadster - I was moving on.


Then, out of curiosity, I test drove the new Porsche Boxster.
I was instantly hooked. It is hard to describe just how much better the new version of the Boxster is versus its predecessor.
It is better in every way - substantially better.
The former was fun and competent.
Enoyable.
The new Boxster looks, sounds and drives like a supercar.
It is incredible.

If you really need/want a practical car, avoid this car like the plague - lest you be seduced too."
porsche,boxster,2014,smerdyakov, 10/03/2014,The best sports car on the planet,5,"I purchased a new 2104 Boxster on 10-2-14 at Checkered Flag in Va Bch. I drove both S and base cars, thinking that I would surely want the S: I was wrong. The base car does not have, as the Edmunds ""con"" headline asserts ""mediocre acceleration"". It may be somewhat slower than the S version, but it is far more than adequate for normal use. In fact, it is faster than the 2006 Cayman S that I once owned. 
The one option that I recommend as essential is the PDK transmission, which is a remarkable unit. Those who insist on having a manual six-speed are making a mistake.
In the recent past I have had several versions of the Cayman, a Audi TT RS and a Corvette GS. The Boxster is superior to all

I kept going out to the garage because I couldn't believe I bought it.  But two years later I found myself on the side of the road twice with transmission problems.  Fortunately the car was still under warranty and Porsche replaced the transmission.  But now 5 years later the interior door panels are pulling away starting a the windows.  It is so unsightly I'm now embarrassed to drive my car.  I never put the top down anymore because it is very obvious to see then.  When I took the car to the dealership to see about getting it fixed I was told it would be $2000 per door panel.  He didn't even look it up.  I'm certainly not the only one having this problem.

porsche,boxster,2014,Patrick, 11/10/2015,Amazing Car,5,"I have had my Boxster for over one year.  By far the most dynamic car I have ever owned.  I got the smaller engine, with the automated manual transmission, In LA congestion, it has plenty of power.  The gallop between 80 mph and 110 mph is intoxicating.  It accelerates assuredly and smoothly, and its reflexes are truly sports car athletic.  The interior is very comfortable and well appointed, and for less than $70,000, the car is an amazing value.  People say that  the trunk space is limited, but honestly, I have done a couple of Costco runs, and trips to the airport with luggage, without too much of a problem.   The top goes up and down in a matter of seconds -- and on the go when you are pulling out -- easy and convenient.  One thing -- at least in LA -- the car gets a lot of attention.  Between its looks, and the sound of the engine, the Boxster turns a lot of heads.  Now, that could be a good thing, or a bad thing.  If you want to be inconspicuous -- a Boxster may not be for you.

porsche,boxster,2015,JohnCBullen@GMail.com, 10/19/2015,Excellence all around,5,"I traded in my '08 911 (997.1) C4S cabriolet on a 2015 Boxster S. The Boxster is head and tails ahead of the 911 in fit, finish, interior quality, handling, and interior noise. The PCM (entertainment, communication, nav) system on the Boxster is several steps ahead of what what was in the 911. While the 911 is iconic and has a sex appeal superior to the Boxster, the Boxster shines in performance over the 911. This is my third Boxster, and I am of the opinion that the Boxster S is a better balanced car with its mid-engine and weight distribution than the 911, and the power to weight ratio is well within anyone's power requirements.
Update: Two years owning this car, and everything in my review is still valid. A great car!

porsche,boxster,2015,John P., 07/28/2018,2014 Porsche Boxster S,5,"Bought a 2014 Boxster S. Can’t tell you how impressed I am with this car is so many ways. I never liked the look of the boxster and always owned 911’s. That mindset started to change with the redesign in 2013. Every time I would see one on the road or parked, I found myself admiring the new design with the huge air intake ducts that gave it a Porsche GT, Audi R8 and Lamborghini look. I like how they brought the duct shape into the doors too. I never ever thought to look at how refined and classy the interior was when gawking at the exterior. Fast forward a few years and I finally added a 2014 Boxster S to my stable and I am extremely impressed with this car. The sound of the engine is amazing and while it could be a tad quicker, it’s still pretty fast and with the excellent gas mileage it’s just perfect. The interior is also a high point. The design is intuitive and the fit, finish and materials used are top notch. Driving it is a blast and the handling is much better that any of my 911’s hand down. It feels one in its own on the road. I wanted a manual transmission but settled on the PDK and am super impressed with that too which I never thought would be possible. It’s an incredible transmission with a lot of options for driving style. Bottom line:  It’s a lot of car, look and performance for the money. Porsche really made this car right and am finally glad I pulled the trigger. It is a world class Sportscars in every way.

I purchased my 2005 Porsche Carrera GT new, drove it 2,600 miles, and sold it for a $100,000 loss.  It is a horrible car in many ways.  The clutch is too sensitive, I had electrical problems, and any pot holes in the road were a nightmare.  No wonder Porsche has stopped making them.  Do not buy this car!"

porsche,carrera-gt,2005,bill, 04/19/2005,Mind Blowing,1,"The Carrera just oozes brawn out of every pore. I have owned 3 Porsches over two decades and have loved the refinements of their cars but the GT has just gone this bit further. The engine sounds magnificent, the seat positioning is good (I am 5 ft 8), the instruments are well aligned for the driver and visibility is extremely good for its class.  Fine detail has been made to the interior which exudes rich quality.  I will be looking forward to entering the cup races this year. It is always good meet other owners at these events.

porsche,cayman,2007,firsttimer, 12/31/2006,Weekend Delight,4,"I purchased the Cayman to replace our '05 SLK350 and drive it primarily on weekends.  I test drove most of the competition as well as the Cayman S and 911 Cabriolet.  For me, the Cayman has the perfect blend of style, performance, efficiency and value.  Sure, there are times when I think I could use the extra hp but those times have been seldom.  Although some will tell you that they prefer the more ""classic"" line of the 911, I think the Cayman is in a style class by itself.  Just hand the key to any valet if you need confirmation.  If you want a livable, fun to drive two seater, I don't think there is any car on the market that can match the new Cayman."
porsche,cayman,2007,bgsntth, 12/04/2006,True Driver's Car,4,"This is the first Porsche that I have fit into, barring the sunroofless GT3. I have been in a sports car-less funk since I sold my '95 Miata R-package. The Cayman is the perfect replacement. It is a comfortable daily commuter with absolutely brilliant handling and perfect suspension tuning. The 2.7 liter six engine is an absolute gem, very flexible and aurally pleasing. It is also very practical with both trunks and cabin storage."
porsche,cayman,2007,Jordan, 10/06/2006,Better Than My 2003 BMW M3,4,"This is easily the best overall perfoming car that I have owned. It feels quicker than my BMW M3, except from 70 mph up. Its handling outshines all (for the money) except the Lotus Elise, but the build quality and sound from behind you more than make up for any performance difference. The ride quality allows for daily driving without punishment. Additionally, the manual transmission is wonderfully weighted and precise."
porsche,cayman,2007,Susan, 11/02/2010,Best car I have driven,5,I previously had an SLK and a Z4 convertible.  This 2 dr Cayman is so much more fun to drive. I feel like a million dollars whenever I get in it and have owned it for a year and I am not bored with it yet.  I bought it used with low miles and would only trade it in if I was buying another Porsche.
porsche,cayman,2007,pbschroeder, 12/16/2010,Great car,4,"We have had this car for about a month.
It is much faster than our '06 Boxster.
The engine sounds great.
We have an automatic, which makes it a bit of a gas hog, but it shifts quickly and rockets away from the line."
porsche,cayman,2007,P Young, 10/08/2006,Fantastic Car!,5,"In everyday driving the Cayman is civilized, comfortable, and easy to drive.  When the traffic thins out and the road opens up, it takes on a whole different personality, gobbling up twists and turns with the engine roaring like a savage beast.  After a month I still haven't really used the Bose sound system.  The sound of the engine is even better music to my ears.  Now that the break-in period is over, I can savor the sounds of the upper rpm range... sweeeet!"
porsche,cayman,2007,767FO, 01/18/2007,Just Picked One Up...,4,"I just got a new 2007 Cayman S model. I am very happy with it overall. It is great looking, well built, and has a nice interior. It's also very quick. It drives like a sports car, meaning a firm, but not harsh ride. I went with the 19"" wheels. Some options should be standard, but that's Porsche. Its gas mileage stinks, but that's to be expected. This car has great German engineering all around, even in the smallest details."
porsche,cayman,2007,bhegg, 09/11/2010,It just felt right,4,"Ah, what a car. I tested several others - STi, 'Vette, 335i, 370Z. This is the only one that felt just right. Came from a '06 Miata so I didn't want a large car. This had the power, sound, handling, looks...everything. It's just right for me. Sometimes I just wish it had a backseat so I could share the experience w/ more than 1 other person at a time. I have the Carmon Red and it's a beauty but I'm actually surprised at the smiles I get. She definitely holds her own at track days as well of course. Yes, the cup holders seem rather delicate and not well placed - that's why I don't use them. The xenon headlights are very good and I'm happy w/ the stereo. Certified warranty is excellent too!"
porsche,cayman,2007,Chris Hamilton, 03/07/2017,Three years of happy ownership.,4,"Very enjoyable car, nice ride, great sound and decent power from the 2.7 six. Engine very flexible and very smooth.  AC keeps up with high summer temps.  New cost is moderately high but used/certified cost is a lot of car for the money. Design is wonderful and stays in style for a long time. Wonderful sound and driving experience.
"
porsche,cayman,2007,dieseltaylor, 12/11/2006,Class Act,5,"Driving the Cayman s brilliant. Even sitting in it you feel 50% better for being alive.  Everything is to hand switchgear wise, plenty of seat adjustment, good visibility.  The responsiveness of the engine when you are already cruising at 80 reminds you that its really going at half speed. It is so solid on the road that even with side winds doing high speeds. Long bends where previous cars would go light at speed are no problem at all.  The only drawback so far are the chips from small stones on the bonnet - well you can't have everything. I bought the plastic trays for the front and rear storage as recommended by the local Porsche Club chairman.  Roll on the Panamera : )"
porsche,cayman,2007,Jim Sirna, 10/29/2006,"Who Needs the ""S""?",4,"I traded in my 2004 Nissan 350Z and what a difference.  The Cayman is refined, has smooth power, incredible brakes, and handling that is go-cart like.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and this design is a BEAUTY!  It has class, balance, and style.  My Cayman has no options except 18"" Cayman S wheels which I highly recommend and the Arctic Silver Metallic paint.  You don't need anything else and this gets you a sub $50,000 race car for the road."
porsche,cayman,2007,MarkJ, 09/26/2006,Phenomenal Car,5,"Without a doubt the Cayman is the best car I have owned, my previous car was an Audi A6 2.7T. This car does it all, it's fast, handles great, and turns heads.  It has plenty of usable power.  It sounds awesome accelerating. Its build quality is first class. Porsche has built a winnner. "
porsche,cayman,2007,SRB, 01/02/2007,Best Car I've Ever Owned,5,"This is by far the best handling, fun to drive car I've ever owned.  The styling is classic.  The precision steering and great brakes make it feel safe at all times."
porsche,cayman,2007,Dean Farris, 07/17/2009,Obsession,5,"My first Porsche, this speed yellow with black leather beauty is like having a Carrera or a Ferrari without the huge price tag.  I really like the basic sport feel, almost like a vintage car, with not too much electronic stuff, and not so much glossy plastic trim.  As a designer, this car really appeals to me from an aesthetic view. Compared to the Mercedes I was using for a daily driver, this is way more fun, and I love to make 90 degree turns going 45 mph. Now have about 18K miles. Sits in a nice large garage, like a sculpture. Driving a Porsche in Naples is about as good as it gets, even though we have one of the largest PCA memberships in the country. I highly recommend it. Good ego trip."
porsche,cayman,2007,Mark, 08/30/2009,30K Plus review,4,"This car is one of the best handling cars I've ever had.  I used to race a fully track prepared EVO VIII and the Cayman S is as close as cars come to that.  Very exciting over 5200 RPM, plenty of torque and engine sound is aggressive, yet more refined than some kid with a coffee can import.  Better yet, it's a great daily driver with plenty of room for groceries, luggage and whatever else you could want (that was the tipping point for me between the Cayman and the 911)."
porsche,cayman,2007,FTS, 07/05/2010,Can't Bring Myself to Replace It,4,"The vehicle has been perfect for my needs; I commute daily and also enjoy performance driving at the track.  I kept the vehicle in stock form and it has not given me any grief or issues.  A coolant leak that occurred was handled promptly by dealer under warranty, and that has been the only reliability issue for the past 68K miles.  This vehicle exceed my expectations in terms of reliability, versatility and fun factor."
porsche,cayman,2007,James Foley, 11/13/2018,Classic sports car,5,"Perfect, no frills, driver's sports car. 2.7 liter flat six.  250 hp w/ 5-speed manual tranny.  Sound like the specs of a 1973 911RS which now sells for at least a half-mil?  Bought it  seven years ago for $30K; just sold it for $20K w/ 36,000   on the odo. Hard to  imagine a better deal for a buyer.  Rock solid sports car with a good bit of snob appeal. Note:  poor rating for headlights is based on significant fogging of headlight units even when the car was garaged 95% of time.  Expected better of headlight units that cost $2K to replace.  Fortunately, my indie  mechanic was able to refinish them to new-looking for about $200
"
porsche,cayman,2007,jnscolo, 09/08/2009,More fun than you can imagine,5,"The balanced nature of this car stuns me every time I drive it.  The combination of chassis, steering, transmission and engine are the best I have ever experienced.  It is an easy car to drive around town, but one time on a twisty mountain road is all it takes to feel the superlative power and handling.  It is also the best-looking car I've ever owned.  The Cayman is surprisingly practical:  trunks front and rear mean errands, weekend getaways for two, or even two sets of golf clubs get the green light.  The car has been mechanically flawless for 2+ years, although it has two niggling rattles."
porsche,cayman,2007,Bob B, 06/25/2010,I'm In Love With My Car,5,"I now know what Queen was singing about all those years ago. Fun does not begin to describe the driving experience. Heavy traffic has prevented me from really opening her up yet, but the couple times I've been able to accelerate hard on to the highway I could not stop smiling from the sheer exhilaration. She sounds incredible, guys look at her with lust in their eyes and, like a previous reviewer, I catch myself looking back at her after I park her at night. I feel like I'm dating a supermodel (German, of course)."
porsche,cayman,2007,Britain22, 10/30/2010,Great Car,5,"Great car! Have owned it for just over a year and love driving it both to work and on weekend fun trips. Do not plan to drive it cross country, but that was never my intent in the first place. It replaced my Z3 BMW, and while both are really nice cars the Cayman S seems like a star ship, while the Z3 is more of a classic from the 50's. I have yet to find any major issues with the Cayman and hope that it runs as good 10 years from now as it does today. The Navigation system is difficult to figure out the first few times of using it so wish they would team up with Garmin and keep thing simple but it works well once you get it set up. "
porsche,cayman,2007,Jim, 05/15/2008,Fantastic,4,"Beautiful car, fantastic performance.  This car is great on the street and on the track.  On the track, handling is precise and the brakes are awesome.  Enough power to stay with all but the turbo's.  Wide power band.  This engine loves 6200 rpm.  On the street, it attracts a lot of attention.  Lots of leg and head room.  Interior quality is superb."
porsche,cayman,2007,Jason R., 03/31/2019,"""Porsche, there is no substitute"" is the truth!!",5,"I have only owned my 2007 Cayman S 6 speed for a few weeks but I felt compelled to write this review for others looking to purchase. I CAN NOT say long term if this car will be as reliable as they say but in the fist few weeks I CAN say is this is one of the most exhilarating cars I've driven besides my 1994 Dodge Viper RT/10. The 911 guys may call this and the Boxster the ""Poor man's Porsche"" but I can only imagine one would say this because they are upset at themselves for spending so much money on a 911 when the Cayman is, in many ways, a better car. I do not know how the regular Cayman would compare to my S model since I have not driven one to compare but I absolutely love every moment of driving this car. It is my daily driver other than during inclement weather I have a truck for. The fuel consumption is not bad and storage is quite surprising. Driving this car is not like driving anything else. Is truly is a drivers car and an experience I have yet to find with driving anything else. If you are scared to buy one of these cars because of the dreaded IMS bearing issue, DO YOUR RESEARCH and then decide. The 00-05 model year's were the most widely affected due to a thin single row bearing. The 06-08 had a single row bearing as well but it was a wider bearing like that of the pre 00 model years with the dual row bearing and has said to have a very low failure rate (Around 1%). I personally think this is one of the best sports for the price. It is a Porsche though so with that said, maintenance is not the cheapest so find a good Indy shop with a Porsche specialist. If you are considering one of these fine cars, go and test drive one. But don't do it without having funds available to purchase because you will want to take it home!!!
"
porsche,cayman,2007,Scott, 09/30/2006,"Great Car, but Overpriced",4,"I wanted to test drive the new entry level Porsche. The Boxster S is the same price so it is a better deal.  I liked the car, but it needs 50 more horses to really be worth the $55,000 price tag.  The handling and shifter are the best.  Compared to BMWs and the Corvette, which both cost same amount, this Cayman is way more fun to drive and it has better handling.  But 245HP is way to weak for a $55,000 car.  Porsche also needs to stop jacking people on the options which can easily add $10,000 - $20,00 more to the car's price.  Skip the Cayman and get the Cayman S or 911.  But that engine sounds sweet!"
porsche,cayman,2007,thecory, 11/25/2008,Great Sports Car,4,"Fun to drive and plenty of power. I'm 6'2"" and comfortable although the seat is all the way back. Still plenty of head room. Standard seats really hug you might be a little narrow for someone over 200 lbs. Tall passenger seat totally obscures the small window behind the door creating a blind spot. They can also hit and damage the headliner if not careful. Bose system has too much bass but a satisfactory adjustment can be made. The wheel size makes a huge difference in ride quality and the larger wheels will probably lead to more rattles with time. The used Caymans I drove with 17s felt sold and had little rattling. 18s were a little worse and 19s were much worse. I went with 18s for looks."
porsche,cayman,2007,michele, 10/30/2006,Excellent Car,5,This is my first Porsche and I absolutely love it!  I drove a Jaguar before this one and I definitely prefer the Porsche Cayman.  It captures attention every time I'm on the road.
porsche,cayman,2007,ntierprez, 06/16/2008,Cayman S,4,"This is my daily driver and haven't had a single issue with the car (I have over 30k miles). The car is absolutely beautiful and attracts a lot of attention from other drivers.  The storage capacity in the car is unbelievable, 2 trunks with over 15 cubic feet of storage capacity.  I haven't had a situation yet where i couldn't fit everything into my car.  I average about 20 MPG which isn't bad for Washington DC traffic.  It is an absolute joy to drive and it worth every penny."
porsche,cayman,2007,Jim Harries, 08/31/2009,Coupe de grace!,4,"The Cayman is a superb package. While the car can be comfortably driven in the city, it is a delight on the back roads where traffic is not an issue. The high power-to-low weight ratio and the mid-engine layout make the car nimble and well-balanced with loads of torque. I have owned several coupes and this is the best one by far. It is a car that really responds to you as a driver. And of course the body styling is fantastic! "
porsche,cayman,2007,ron, 02/01/2007,My First Porsche,4,"I have had many Corvettes, all of which were maintenance nightmares. I moved on to the 2004 350Z, which never cost me a dime and delivered lots of performance and pleasure.  I wanted to move up to Porsche and liked the mid-engine design.  I love the sound this car gives to you with each gear change.  It handles better than my Z and is just a touch faster. "
porsche,cayman,2007,mf, 03/01/2007,"What a Car! Vielen Dank, Porsche!",5,"it was time to move into modern times from my 1981 Corvette. I am more than thoroughly pleased with my Cayman!  The body design is, well, simply gorgeous. For 245HP, it performs nicely even at >6,000 ft. elevation. The fit and finish are incredible. At a lanky 6' 2"", it is more than accommodating. It has lots of luggage space.  It will be terrific for our road-trip ventures. My black-on-black certainly turns heads (yes, a little ""vanity"" there...). It's just a perfect fit.  It's a fantastic car for the price, period."
porsche,cayman,2007,Dr. DeVore, 03/10/2007,My Cayman,5,"I have owned Benz, Z3s, Z4s, Boxsters, RX7s, Talons, and I am ashamed to say 6 Corvettes. The Cayman is one of the most wonderful cars that I have owned.  With the rear spoiler up, people actually think I am driving a 911.  With the quality and look of the interior, I did not have to go with the 911.  The ride is smooth, the handling is superb, and the middle range power and acceleration (60-120) is out of this world!  I purchased this one and will own it forever.  I retire in 3 years and am looking forward to driving cross country and seeing every sight that I have missed before I pass away. Love my Cayman!"
porsche,cayman,2007,Pat, 04/21/2007,My Cayman S,4,"This is a true sports car, and sounds like it. The quality of the vehicle is superb. This car is for those that love to drive, and get there quickly and safely. The brakes are the best of any vehicle I have ever driven. The manual transmission is one of the best I have used. I simply love to drive this car."

Car puts smiles on my face everytime I drive it. Hugs the corners like its glued to the road. Excellent build quality and gorgeous sheet metal - lots of compliments. 
porsche,cayman,2007,Taxol, 09/12/2007,A ride in the theme park,4,"I bought a silver 2007 Cayman with Tiptronic in September 2007.  I believe it's one of the few Caymen with Tiptronics in CA.  Engine: Tiptronic still delivers excellent power / acceleration without the Cayman S engine. Best of all, it's idiot proof.  Inside: the cockpit design is unique. To quote my wife, it feels like getting into a 007 car. However, Tiptronic handle bar does not light up at night.  Ride experence:  a luxury sedan can get you from point A to point B quietly, without you ever noticing its presence.  A Cayman, on the other hand, will turn each driving trip into a Disneyland theme park ride - fun, exciting, but not scary.    "
porsche,cayman,2007,Dan, 09/12/2007,Porsche... there is no substitute.,5,"This is a sportscar that has to be driven to be believed and for the normal driver the 2.7 has more than enough hp and torque to keep a permanent grin on your face.  As mine is a daily driver, in heavy traffic, I chose the Tiptronic and I'm not disappointed with its performance at all.  In manual mode it shifts extremely quickly and it screams thru the twisty turns, easily keeping pace with my buddy's Corvette... without ever touching the brakes.  The car is a real looker in meteor gray with the Boxster S wheels, chrome twin exhaust and I really like the preferred package extra touches.  Be prepared to talk ""Porsches"" to complete strangers drooling over your car as most have never seen one.  "
porsche,cayman,2007,Fitzhugh B. LEE, 10/31/2007,Porsche Cayman,4,"Have 1500 miles so far on this 2007 Cayman. Steering is tight, precise, responsive and consistently provides an ""on-rails"" cornering experience. The acceleration is quick, but not overpowering. The engine sound is great! The looks are superb, and the gas mileage is surprisingly good. I'm averaging around 26 mpg. Have yet to take it on an extended cross country, but anticipate that the mileage will increase with more miles on the engine. I use this car almost daily and it is always a thrill to drive. The seats are form fitting on my 6 foot 1 inch frame and as a consequence are warm to my back, but there is plenty of head and leg room. Cargo room is generous for a car in this class."
porsche,cayman,2007,Don, 03/24/2008,The 2.7 (aka base) Cayman,4,"Much has been written/said about the Cayman s; all justified.  The Cayman 2.7 has enjoyed fewer reviews, yet it remains a totally engaging Porsche.  It has the same platform, same build quality, same fun to drive, better fuel economy (mine gets 27-28 mpg mixed driving... And runs at 30+ at steady freeway speed!).  So, what is the downside?  surely not the 10k less Price!     Yes, it has 50 less hp, concomitantly less torque and 5 speeds instead of the lovely 6 speed.  But for daily driver duties, one cannot even use the 245 hp the Cayman 2.7 offers!   I've taken my 2.7 on a track day (thunderhill) and find that it handles and marks well most other makes and was a blast to drive.  "
porsche,cayman,2007,Al, 03/25/2008,My Face Hurts!,5,From smiling when I drive this thing.  It moves where I want it to move and does it quickly and without lag.   I love this car!
porsche,cayman,2007,Barry Lee, 05/18/2008,"2007/8 Cayman after 10,000 miles",4,"I am 6' and 220 lbs. Nice head/leg/cargo room. Have 11,000 miles on the car driving locally, and to and from CA from Fl. Comfortable long distance driver.  Outstanding looks. Have been stopped several times by compliment givers. Handling is as though one were driving on rails. Acceleration is swift though not overpowering. Actual gas mileage is 23/27 so far. Have 18"" wheels. Bose system has too much bass for my taste, and I have to dial the db down to negative numbers to get balanced sound. This is my first Porsche and I love it. . I highly recommend this car for what it is....an exhilarating driving experience every time. J.D. Powers #1 rating influenced my decision to buy. I'm glad I did"
porsche,cayman,2007,Dan Scott, 09/02/2017,Loads of fun!,5,"Upgrade the stereo system. Everything else is great!
"
porsche,cayman,2007,Wil D, 02/09/2018,Cheap Fun,5,Bought it 2016 with 94K miles. Sold it 2017 with 118K miles only because I lost my job. Great car for the money. Upgrade to low temp waterpump. Spent maybe 2K in maintenance but that’s not much for a Porsche. 
porsche,cayman,2007,jay, 09/24/2006,awesome Ride,5,"The Porsche Cayman handles like a dream.  Its performance is great, the lines look like a '37 Bugatti Atlantic.  Porsche did a great job with this car."
porsche,cayman,2007,Dano, 06/30/2007,I think I made a mistake...,3,"I drooled over the Cayman for a month before finally buying the car.  I think it is a real stunner in sheet metal, prettiest car on the road.  I am starting to find the interior noise and the rough ride wearing on my nerves, especially if the pavement is rough. I came out of a 330ci that was a nice car and almost as peppy, but not as much fun to drive.  The dealer suggested I change out the tires to a non performance model but that is a bit costly so I guess I'll just deal with the road noise.  I can't imagine going on a long trip in the Cayman without plenty of Motrin.  Starting to remind me of my ex - beautiful to look at but hard to take after awhile.  Maybe I just miss my BMW."
porsche,cayman,2007,jim lentini, 11/30/2010,Better than I expected,5,"Have been interested in this car for a while. Finally had the chance to drive one and fell in love. Plenty of room with the seat all the way back, great driving position, perfect balance and the sweet sound of the engine. I don't think it gets much better than this. Plan on having this for a long time."
porsche,cayman,2007,Justs4l, 11/13/2006,I'm Sure Glad I Didn't Get the BMW.,5,I had ordered a '07 BMW 3-Series Coupe and I thank God every day I get into this car that I purchased a Cayman instead of waiting for the BMW.  This car fits like a glove and drives like a dream.  I find myself feeling sorry for all those people driving anything other than a Porsche. 
porsche,cayman,2007,Dr. Philip DeVore, 02/21/2007,My Cayman Rules,4,"I have driven over 40 autos since the age of 16.  6 Corvettes, 3 BMWs, 3 Mazdas, 3 Mercedes, Talons (Junk), Buicks, 442s, and countless others, but this is the best thing since sliced manifolds.  The Cayman is far, above, and beyond any other autos out there.  Although it has more horsepower than my Boxster, and less torque, it is the quickest thing I have driven since my 427 vette fitted with tripower (69).  The mid range  power is fun, and truly sends me and passengers into the seats."
porsche,cayman,2007,MrCoffee, 03/19/2007,Pure Porsche,4,"I just purchased my first Porsche and am very happy with its performance. I traded up from a BMW X5 and haven't looked back once. The handling is nothing short of telepathic and cabin comfort is ideal. I opted for the Tiptronic automatic transmission because of traffic and am pleased with its performance. The car has turned a good many heads since I purchased it. The cargo space is surprisingly generous for such a car, as I can fit a (small) bag of golf clubs in the rear hatch. "
porsche,cayman,2007,bulldog, 03/24/2007,Fun car,5,This has been an absolutely fun car to drive.  It is driveable on a daily basis and just a kick to be in.  Bought with preferred package plus with tip and love every aspect of it.
porsche,cayman,2007,Timothy Kennedy, 07/17/2007,Cayman out of Water,5,This car is so fun to drive.  I love the automatic transmission (can't drive a stick anymore for medical reasons).  I get a lot of looks in this car.
porsche,cayman,2007,sandpuppy, 08/06/2007,The REAL Ultimate Driving Machine,4,"The Cayman S is simply the best sports car for the buck.  No, it's not the fastest, but straight-line speed is only a part of the equation.  This car handles like no  other I've owned, including a multitude of Benzes, BMWs, Miatas and an RX-8.  To add to its value, it is a useful sports car with decent storage and trunk space for its two passengers.  And it works as a daily driver with decent gas mileage and comfort.  This car is a truly wonderful machine that Porsche will probably regret that they built once 911 owners find out that buying down will give them a new high!"
porsche,cayman,2007,T. Pruitt, 08/10/2007,"Just like old times, just better",5,"I've had my '07 Cayman S for about a month now and all I can say is WOW! Of the Porsches I have owned and driven, this is by far and away the best handling and best looking. The husky exhaust note and power @ 4500 rpms and above is incredible. The Cayman S is 100% pure sports car. With a few tweaks to the 3.4 ltr. engine, suspension and exhaust coupled with the mid engine platform, the Cayman S's performance is as good if not better than the 997 for a lot less money. "
porsche,cayman,2007,Carmona Red, 08/11/2007,Glued to the Road Always,4,"Bought 6 speed manual Cayman S as pleasure driver, not everyday commuter.  Have had for 2 months, have about 3000 miles on it, highlight was a drive up and back on back roads including Highway 1 LA to Monterey for MotoGP a few weeks ago. Handling, shifting, road feel superb, I spent a lot of time going through the twisties and laughing out loud with pleasure.  Has plenty of power on the street to get you tickets even if it does not have 911 hp.  And it is not even broken in yet.  Car gets a lot of looks, and I love the look of it (and I hate the Boxster.) Yes the car is noisy and a very firm ride (19 inch wheels), stereo is so so but listening to the engine is the real musical experience!"
porsche,cayman,2007,vipersaint, 09/30/2007,My Cayman S,4,"Handling without peer; superb balance in the corners; unmatched braking; Porsche quality.  Car is funnest to drive of any I've had (inc. Vettes and Vipers) - pure driving experience.  Commands attention.  Xenon lights a must. Buy the S model, you'll thank yourself in the end."
porsche,cayman,2007,JG, 08/15/2007,The REAL Ultimate Driving Machine,4,"This is my first Porsche after a myriad of other sports cars, Z4, RX-8, several Miatas, SLK, etc.  The Cayman S is without question superior to all of the foregoing.  Its sound is intoxicating as is its performance and handling, and brakes.  It works well as a daily driver, too.  It has very satisfactory storage space and holds my golf clubs in the rear trunk with a little juggling.  It is just a great car that Porsche is holding back on to keep the iconic 911 on top."
porsche,cayman,2007,Leo Pappas, 10/20/2007,Rock Solid,4,This car is better than I dreamed.  It is rock solid and feels like it was carved out of a single slab of granite.  It is extemely well balanced and the back end just digs in at virtually any speed.  It just wants to run fast and is a joy to drive.  It is more immpressive in the corners as I find myself seeking tight curving roads.  I get looks and compliments all the time.  Well worth the purchase.
porsche,cayman,2007,nuckinfuts7, 03/15/2008,Fantastic Sports Car!!,5,"I fell in love with this car at the 2006 LA Auto show and ordered it from the factory, spec'd just like I wanted it. Waited nearly 4 months for it to arrive, but well worth the wait. This car is special in every way. Plenty of power, handles better than anything I've driven (I own two other sports cars that are very highly rated), and looks great! I'm of average size and weight, and strapping into this thing feels like stepping into my favorite pair of jeans. (Might be a bit small for anyone taller than 6'2"".) Handling is it's strongest suit - feels like it will never break loose!"
porsche,cayman,2008,blue098, 05/15/2012,I've ruined all other cars for myself...,4,"I bought this car used 12 months ago and have put over 10K miles on it. Every mile driven has been a joyous one and I've had no performance or mechanical problems with it so far (at 28K total miles).

A few minor interior rattles (easily fixed) and some minor comfort issues for the longer trips but without a doubt the most fun & engaging vehicle I've ever driven. And I've driven cars of all types, sizes, shapes, and costs.

People regularly give it some great looks when I'm driving around town and rarely does a highway trip happen that someone doesn't pull up next to me with a ""thumbs up"".

Sounds great, handles great, and has more storage room than you'd think given it's size."
porsche,cayman,2008,DrDebt, 10/04/2008,There are cars and then there is a Cayman,4,"When shopping there are some cars that you mull over hoping you won't second guess the decision, and then there some where the decision is made within 30 seconds of turning the key and dropping it into gear.  This is one of those.  With the sharp snarl of lighting up the 6-cylinders that share the mid-chassis location giving perfect balance, you know this is a drivers' car.  Spartan but comfortable, the interior is well laid out and gadget free. Lots of leg and head room, and excellent views without blind spots.  Until you've driven a Porsche, you'll not appreciate the torque that makes the 6-speed transmission more than enough to zing to 60 mph in under 5 seconds, and brakes to stop as quick."
porsche,cayman,2008,Herb, 06/10/2008,2008 Cayman,4,"This is the latest of many Porsches I have owned. My first 911 was purchased in 1972 and the last was a 1997 993 C4S. All great cars, though the Cayman really answers the quest for a drivers car. The balance, practicality and performance put a smile on you face whether you're on the freeway, twisties or just around town. "
porsche,cayman,2008,Nick, 08/18/2008,The Perfect Car,5,"The Porsche Cayman is by far the most well engineered car I have driven. I have test driven most of its competitors and the handling, responsiveness, as well as the overall quality is superb without reservation.  The mileage for a sports car is excellent and surprised me. The comfort is excellent, especially in the lower back area. I have been envying Porsches ever since I was in high-school. As another Porsche owner told me, this is a sports car not a luxury car masquerading as a sports car. After I drove it I could clearly see what she meant.   The swaying factor around curves is for the most part non-existent.  The bottom line is this car is the best choice in its class."
porsche,cayman,2008,TH, 05/19/2009,Best Car I have ever owned,5,"I have owned this car for one year.  It has been great.  Two major trips of 1,000 miles, plenty of room for luggage for two. No need for trips to the dealership, reliability is the best I have seen in years. Well put together,  a great engine sound, seats and ride is very acceptable for a sports car.  Great Fuel economy - average 24 mpg around town and 31 mpg on our two trips."
porsche,cayman,2008,Dan Smith, 08/09/2017,"best looking , performing car I have seen",5,"I selected the 08 because it did NOT have all the electronic crap that they put in today.  I want a drivers performance sport car that drives like a formula 1 car.   I did not want a computer, phone, gizmo terminal that  is to defeat the reason to have a porsche .        Running Michelin PS Z  tires and the car is stable and smooth all the way to 150....   I can take 55 mph curves at 100 with ease.   When manual shifting I wind it to 4800 rpm and shift... and you feel like your on a rocket...  in 400 yards your doing 80.... from a standing start.     Gas milage, about 19.8-20.5 at speeds of 75-85      Ac is good.      What I do like is the simple dash with out the screens and entertainment.  Everything easy to run.  Gages easy to read,   I have a MBZ 250 coupe and the porsche is in the same quality range   Dealer service is fantastic and I get new Porsche loaner cars wa every service.   With 80,000 miles any worry about engine problems is far from a problem. 
 Sold the car last month, because I came to the realization that I was overwhelmed by the high performance and speed the Caymen would do...   Speed?    In a short deserted desert road I put it to the floor....got to 155 before I backed off...it was still climbing.    This is a car for the person that is on top of his driving game and skill.   The car demands 200% attention like flying an airplane,if you don't have that skill level it can kill you.... This is not a daily commute driver.  Its hard core performance stuff.  You can keep up with Lamborghini and Ferrari's if that is your wish ( top speed Porsche lists is 212 mph)

After owing the car for a year, I came to the realization that if I kept the car it would very likely kill me.    Its a safe car as I mentioned it is like a safe airplane  in that it requires a person trained in its operation.  You can not just go turn the key and zip off because your going to be unaware of the dangers of operation such a high performance machine  and worse the temptation to exceed your ability skill level very, very fast    I sold the car recognizing  that it is like a motorcycle in that its not IF it is going to hurt you but WHEN.  I also discovered that My MBZ 250C, with the same tires, handled just about as well and a lot more comfortably and quietly.        It was fun to drive but I quickly became aware of the temptation to exceed safe limits, for me.

porsche,cayman,2008,John, 06/20/2008,Perfectly balanced,5,"The blend of handling, braking and acceleration makes the car a joy to drive.  I purchased a basic model (non-s, 5 speed, 19 inch wheels, bose, heated seats) which was actually hard to find.  If you want to pay for all the other goodies go for it, but they are expensive and some add quite a bit of weight. Trust me, you won't miss them and you can save 25 grand.  It's a driver's car all the way but remarkably comfortable, quiet, and it really does get the 29 mpg highway. "
porsche,cayman,2008,mellowtip1, 07/25/2008,I've made it,5,"Was about to purchase the 08 M3 but after doing the research and insurance projections, I went with the new Porsche 08 Cayman Design. I own #350 of 777 and everywhere I go it is a sure stunner. I always grew up loving the 911 but I must say this car has done it for me, and although it may not put up 911 numbers it is the most practical for an everyday car weekend driving enthusiast. The exhaust is so sweet and the comfort of the interior is awesome. I am 5/9"" and have driven passenger as tall as 6'3"" and they all are in awe at that space and the drive.  This car is a keeper and I can only see it appreciating in value. "
porsche,cayman,2008,Mikey, 05/28/2010,Awesome,4,"I love this car.  I had a BMW before, but the Cayman is a true sports car.  I have had the car for 3 months and have already had 5 people stop me at read lights or the gas station to tell me how awesome the car looks.   "
porsche,cayman,2008,CSDriver, 12/27/2008,Love It!,5,"Drove my Cayman S for about 6 months before storing it for the winter. I use it as my daily driver. I now look forward to driving to and from work and on date nights with my wife. The performance is great and I many times take the long way home to spend a little more time in it. I recommend the Bose stereo upgrade for more low end punch, but many times I find myself listening to the engine sounds more than the radio/cd. Be careful with your customization as it can be expensive. Choose wisely. I am very happy with the standard leather interior and dash. A little more durable than having the full leather interior. The ride is firm, but this is a sports car after all."
porsche,cayman,2008,NewHope Girl, 07/21/2009,Turn the radio off,4,"I bought my 2008 Cayman S two months ago, have scored 2000 miles.  Fun, fun to drive. The only down side is the sound system.  It has intermittent bugs, which of course, the dealer can never recreate.  I have a Bose in my other car, and know that it can sound much better.  "
porsche,cayman,2008,John S., 08/25/2009,"Great Car, One Small Problem",4,"Most beautiful car I've ever owned, with sharp performance to match. Acceleration could be better for the price, but I was never planning to do any drag-racing anyway.  The big problem is the abominable base stereo, which came with the car as ordered by the dealer (it was a leftover 2008 that I got a very good price).  This stereo was state of the art in 1970, and I figured I could upgrade it with aftermarket equipment, but at $2200 just for new speakers and amps, I decided to just live with it.  If you get a Cayman, be sure to order the Bose upgrade."

to the car performance when you turn it on, I see
several comments on the cars stereo system which is a bit out of date no Bluetooth or iPod/MP3 player as standard, cost me $700.0 for so, so IPod

porsche,cayman,2008,MARK URAKAWA, 06/02/2016,watch out for pricing,1,"A good handling car but its easy to overpay. Dealers overcharge on the car and once you buy the car and want to sell it you notice you really overpaid. IMS problems plague this model, could be running then the IMS bearing explodes and you have a major engine catastrophe. Not like a American car or Japanese car the price would be outrageous a new engine and then you have to junk the car. I suggest getting a 2009 or later version. These cars don’t sell well new and are scarce, overpaying is easy. I would beware, like any German car they are over rated if it is not a S model <span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span>don’t buy it the performance is lacking in non S models

It doesn't take long to see the car is quality built and all the details were done extremely well. One thing is I am tall and fit into the Cayman with absolutely no problem. The headroom is great. It shifts beautifully and there is no other word except ""fun"" to describe driving this car. My two sons who are in their 20s say ""dad you finally got a cool car"" which just shows the younger generation knows something good when they see it. Would highly recommend this car to anyone considering it. "

In the past, I have owned Bimmer, Mercedes, Lexus & Infiniti in the past. By far, Cayman gives the most exhilaration and fun. Above all, it returns 19.7 mpg in average and this is simply incredible for a pure sports car."
porsche,cayman,2008,hook, 03/21/2009,Absolute blast and practical,5,I bought my Cayman used with 1000 miles on it.  The next day my wife and I left on a trip to a wedding and vacation in NYC.  We were able to pack for week long trip with formal clothes for rehearsal dinner and formal wedding.  All our luggage fit no problem.  I then got sick and my wife had to drive to NYC she had not driven a manual in 10 yrs and wanted to practice before leaving the hotel.  She shifted twice said this is great and before I knew it we were comfortably cruising at 80 mph.  My car in 9 months has been trouble free and a blast to drive.

Some complaints I have about this car are body integrity, stereo and Tiptronic buttons. Its rear-end produces rattle noises.

porsche,cayman,2009,anonimo, 11/21/2009,Nothing even comes close,5,"Fantastic engine, brakes, chassis, steering, interior... this really is the finest true spots car value available. Had an Audi TTS and while it was a very capable and well-built sports car, it just didn't offer the the perfect balance and driving dynamics of the Cayman. And the beautiful curves of the exterior are very reminiscent of the classic 911s of the 80s and 90s. The Cayman has become the ultimate Porsche (and an especially exceptional value with current incentives!)."
porsche,cayman,2009,Tony, 09/07/2009,Wow--the best,5,"Great car--connected to the road, fast and plenty of low-end torque with the new PDK auto transmission, even in the my 2.9 model. Impeccable build quality,  just don't overdue the options, or else it will get very expensive! (for example, standard manual seats are GREAT, no need for sport seats or even electric). Stunningly beautiful, espec in light colors (white, silver, etc.). The best handling car I ever had (including BMW's and Audi's), it probably has changed my life some in that I LOVE (instead of dreading) my 45 minute commute to work back and forth every day. (Chose this over the 335i in the end, a great car too but so refined that some of the pure joy was engineered out of it)"

Great looks. If you like 911s, this car will out handle any 911. Sounds awesome from in the car. Feels like it's carved out of a solid piece of granite. Very rugged little car."

porsche,cayman,2009,Steven, 04/27/2018,"2009 Cayman, No Substitute For Elite Sports Car",5,"If your looking for the ultimate sports car, look no further than a Porsche Cayman. From style, performance & relying on a driving experience like no other, all signs point to a Cayman. First, it's a two-seater with enough room for storage & weekend getaways. Due to the unique hatchback design, I can pack my golf clubs, suitcases & accessories with more room available in the forward trunk compartment. German design shares this idea with it's cousin, the VW. Comfort, handling and performance will get you to where you need to go in record time, if you so choose. Shifting & speed gets you around slow traffic & into the clear in a breeze. Gas mileage is excellent & style points off the charts. The Base model has enough HP @275 to give you the driving experience you can enjoy. The S model, for 30 more HP & 5K to 9K more cash, boasts you to dangerous speed levels, if your not experienced. Go test drive a used Cayman & you'll see for yourself why Porsche has been the premier sports car maker for decades!

porsche,cayman,2014,Mozart, 04/24/2019,"A great sports car, with amazing handling",5,"The flat 6 cylinder base motor is a great sounding engine. I would say the only complaint is that it's not just a bit more powerful. You hear that from quite a few owners. But at the same time, how many drivers are going to have the skill set to be able to handle that extra horse power? I have the DPK 7 speed, with paddle shifters and the 14 way sport heated seats. They are very comfortable. On a 6 hour drive after purchasing the car, I had zero complaints about the comfort level of these seats. The other complaint you hear from Cayman owners, is that a base model car, that started at $53,500 MSRP, doesn't have a lot of options standard. My car new had an MSRP of just under $69,000. I have the Navigation system, upgraded stereo, Sport package with the 19"" wheels. I bought it with 25,204 miles on it, and got it for a fraction of the new price. The car handles fantastically. Great grip from the 265/40-19VR Michelin Super Sports on the rear and 235/40-19VR fronts. The acceleration isn't going to push you into the seats at 5.7 seconds to 60MPH. But it has a high redline at 7,400, and once you get it up around 4,000 RPM the magic happens. 60mph-100mph happens before you know it. And when you do hit the triple digit number, you don't feel like you are going that fast. The suspension is tight, and you do feel the bumps but not so much so that it is bothersome. There is almost zero body roll when entering turns at high speeds. Much faster than I'm used to but the grip is just insanely good. The wide base and the summer UHP tires just work their magic. The car has beautiful lines, and it turns heads where ever I go. I'm talking about people stopping and staring, or doing the 90 degree head turn as I go by, with that flat 6 humming its baritone growl. The interior is fairly upscale, with excellent fit and finish. The one gripe is the cup holders are a bit weak. I don't trust to put my coffee tumbler in the too shallow holders. But that's a trivial complaint. You do hear the road noise, and the sound of the engine as she purrs and then growls as the RPM's climb. A wonderful sound that I will never tire of hearing!
"
porsche,cayman,2014,Don, 10/16/2016,Base PDK is the daily driver king,5,"My 2016  base model Cayman has the PDK transmission. This is my daily driver, as such, economy & reliability were important considerations. I constantly  obtain 31/32 MPG at 80+ MPH. In spite of  consistent reviews that claim the base engine lacks power, I find the 275 HP adequate and the base Cayman a blast to drive on open roads. The base engine would most likely lack required power to be competitive on a high performance track race, especially when powering out of turns for maximum lap times, but since I'll never get it on a race track, shes plenty fast. The PDK  transmission maximizes the cars performance, it's split second shifts can't be matched by man. I got the standard 18"" wheels & passed on every other option other than navigation, comfort pkg & sport steering wheel. After adding transportation fees and a clear bra I wangled a deal of $56,000 plus tax&license. I've had the car 7 months & 5,000 miles with no issues or regrets.  If your thinking about a sports car, I would strongly recommend the base Cayman with PDK as a consideration.
 As of mid April 2017, I  have nearly 8,000 trouble free miles on my base Cayman. On my latest weekend trip it got a whooping 33.6 MPG at 80/85 MPH!! The only negative is the cost of maintenance, the 1st oil change ran nearly $350!!! I'm told the 2nd service will be nearly $750.00 AND the 4th or 40,000 service is an astronomical $1500!! These are little mentioned details not provided by Porsche dealers during the buying experience. I do love the car, so I'll pay  & hopefully keep it 10 years. Just a reminder, mine is a 2016 model with the 2.7 liter six cylinder. The new  2017 Porsche Cayman's are now designated 718 models and have new 4 cylinder turbo charged engines, a design that's yet to be proven.
It's now April 2018, I have 11,000 miles on the odometer without a hitch. All the hype about the base model with 275 HP being slow, is strictly MFG spin to get  buyers into high end models for more profit with a chance to visit your local jail. My battery was marginal so the dealer installed a new one under warranty. The car is all I expected EXCEPT for the cost of maintenance. The 10,000 mile service did cost $350.00, & the 2 yr (or  20,000 mi) service cost me over a grand and now I understand the 40,000 mi service is nearly TWO GRAND!!! I also head from Porsche service reps that the 718 Turbo Cayman is even more!! So be prepared to take out a 2nd on your house  once a year.
 As of Oct 2018, I now have just under 15,000 miles, no issues or problems, love the car as much today a the day I bought it, of course the 3 year/30,000 oil change is coming due, that may be a bit of a downer, depending on how much I get hit with.

porsche,cayman,2014,Chris L., 01/30/2017,Remarkable car...,5,"First, I am an engineer in the world of transportation, mostly left brained with appreciation of art and music, hyper critical of all things automotive and not prone to hyperbole. This all started with a 2007 Cayman. In 56000 miles the car never broke once, nothing. One headlight bulb burned out and the batteries in the wheel sensors went to sleep. No leaks, no oil consumption, original brakes, 1.5 sets of tires. The car kept running while driving through the full force of a hurricane in Texas. Tractor trailers pulling doubles, carrying giant windmill blades totally buried the car with tire wash several times, the car never noticed, it managed ""as bad as it gets"" with grace and control, flawless. My faith in Porsche is rock solid. The 2014 Cayman; driving back from Lake Tahoe, pull off into a Porsche dealer and sit in a 2016 Cayman, it has me at Hello. Can't afford new, but CPO solves the problem with an anthracite brown, base 2014, with tan interior and 9600 miles on the odometer. Dealer research (not CARFAX) shows 3 software updates, no service problems, wrote a check, car is mine. This car is unbelievable, not an engineering term. It spent 2 winters in New York State. The car is flawless. Handling, motor, PCM, comfort, climate control, lighting, PDK etc., flawless. I learned to fly years ago, this is better. History puts 7 BMW sedans in my driveway, so far this is better. The car knows what I expect from it, before I ask. Not a car word, but the experience is ""personal"", balanced, involving. It's more like you wear the car then drive the car. My hope is the 2014 can live up to the delivery of the 2007. Time will tell the story, but for now ""remarkable"" fits best.

In the end I sold this remarkable car. The emotional burden every time I left the car parked somewhere and the thought of something happening to it was not worth it. I know of more than one person who has taken the same path. The car was resold in less than 12 hours. I wanted to purchase a Porsche SUV, but could not afford it.

As a final comment, I believe Porsche will live to regret moving the Cayman to 4 cylinders.

porsche,cayman,2014,Tom Markovich, 09/23/2018,Best Bang for the Buck,5,"Personal background: I have owned 35 cars; six Porsche, three of which were/are Cayman. My 2014 S has done everything asked of the car and with grace and style. Twenty four track days, 32 drag racing nights (for which twelve trophys were awarded), 18,000 miles (total 25,000 since I am the second owner) and not one issue, nothing. The leg room, utility and oneness with the driving position exceeds all other cars I have owned or test driven. While I have tried to find a replacement (the usual suspects up to $110,000), none have provided this joy of driving. All cars have a cost to properly maintain with more expensive ones more than less expensive. By being selective on who works on the car, these costs can be controlled. The miles of smiles with this car have been priceless.

The NAV / Bose Sound System / Interior much better than previous model.
Handling is exceptional and exterior looks greatly improved.
My only issue is that I bought a dealer demo with 750 miles.

porsche,cayman,2014,cobrienmx, 12/01/2013,Base 2014 Cayman,3,"I purchased this car from Brumos and had the most positive experience ever buying a car. Delivery took about an hour. The quality of this car is outstanding, it handles like it is glued to the ground, and there is plenty of power to get you out of trouble immediately. Luggage space is impressive and long drives are comfortable. I got 29.2 mpg with the cruise control set to 80. I never thought I would be doing this I have become addicted to performance driving schools and events. Although this car is no dragster (275 hp vs 600+), it is unmatched by most cars in turns and is extremely well balanced. (thank you blue flag) If a driver can smoothly carry momentum they will be tough to hang with.

After 9000 miles and over $30,000 in repairs and very long waits for parts (nothing seems to be stocked and takes a boat from Germany after being custom made - it is not unusual for the car to be in the shop for 3-5 months) I would say that after owning it for 2.5 years it has spent close to a year in the shop.

As if the design team took my measurements and Tailored the car for me. Everything feels of quality. There nothing cheap inside a Porsche. You won’t be let down by any of its craftsmanship. I chose the 981 S over a base 718 simply for the sound. To me each car is identical in every way. Of course there’s some changes on the 718 but good luck picking them out. I drove both and the 981 was a clear choice for me. I wanted a true Bat Mobile and I got it in the 981 S. If I could offer advice to a future cayman owner. I would suggest two options that I got on the car I bought. These options are not what I wouldn’t have ordered on a new car. Get the 14 way seats it’s everything important to driving this car. The 14 way seats are what makes the car fit so Perfect. Next get the high end stereo. It sounds like your driving a high end home theater. You need music in a sports car.

Absolutely love it.... the six speed gearbox is the best I have ever driven (other manual transmission cars I've owned include BMW M5, Toyota Supra Turbo, Saab Viggen, Corvette, Pontiac Trans-Am and Saab 9000 Aero) .  Everything about this car keeps a smile on my face... handling, performance, exhaust note, comfort.  Even in traffic it is a delight to drive.  Word of warning that a Cayman can get expensive with the 'a la carte' approach to options... I kept mine pretty simple.  Key options I think are a must are 20"" wheels, Sport Chrono Package, Bose stereo, and get the 'clear bra' to protect the nose from stones which will damage the paint.  With those, you will not be disappointed.  The only trick which takes a few days to master is getting in if you are a big guy (I'm 6'3"" 220 lbs) but once I did, simple!  One surprise is that Porsche does not offer any extended warranty in the US.  Will have to see if that is an issue once factory warranty is up.  Expect $300 / oil change.

I've owned other sports cars, yet none has come close to given me such driving bliss. My car has the PDK, and the 18"" wheels, both are concessions to  stop and go traffic and poorly maintained roads, yet it's still fantastically engaging. I recommend PASM, it improves ride on poor surfaces, yet on better roads improves handling. Although, I have the sport chrono package, I'm not sure it's worth it. I highly recommend upgrading to the Xenon lights. The heated seats are awesome and surprisingly in the winter you'll love the heated steering wheel. The Bose system is a must have if you like music.

[non-permissible content removed]  I'm a 10 year member of the PCA and have never heard any real Porsche owners talk such stupidity.
Now, regarding the Cayman....I own a 2014 Cayman S with 6 speed manual that was just in for its 3 year (24k miles) service.  What a low cost pleasure it has been.  Still on all four original 20"" Pirellis with 5/32+ tread left and brakes are like new (8/32+)......notwithstanding two half day auto cross events.  Tight as a drum and not a rattle to be found.  The Cayman is a better daily driver than my previous 911/997 S.  Which, BTW, handled spectacularly as well, but the 911 is 300+ lbs heavier, not as nimble and a rougher ride  around town.  I've averaged 21 mpg since new, with 30 mpg at 75+ on highway.  Golf clubs fit in the hatch, the ""frunk"" handles the luggage; I've been on several weekend roundtrips of 600-800+ miles with my wife.  Handling and steering  are truly exceptional - equal or better, IMO, than my buddy's Ferrari 430.  Straight line acceleration isn't head-snapping spectacular, but still very good and better than ""only"" 325 hp suggests; thanks to the 2,900 lb curb weight.  Short throw 6 speed makes rowing your own a true pleasure on this car (notwithstanding that the PDK is the best dual clutch transmission on the planet, for anybody that is uneducatedly concerned about being a namby-pamby)   Overall, the Cayman S is the most enjoyable sports car I've owned.  Recommend PASM and sport chrono packages.  Also, 18 way adaptive sport seats are great, but if you need to save $3,000, the manual ""Sport Seats Plus"" are more than adequate.
It's now been 5.5 years and 40,000 miles and all of the above remains valid.  Zero (0) problems, nothing but routine maintenance and the car is as tight as it was when I took delivery in 2013.

porsche,cayman,2016,Ed in Huntsville, 02/24/2017,2016 Cayman is a real pleaser!,5,"I bought my 2016 Agate Gray Cayman new, and have been driving it for 3 years now. The  car is super fun to drive. Plenty of power, great handling, and superb brakes for having fun on the highways and back roads. The car is agile and accurate, moving perfectly in response to a tight steering ratio, and great road feel transmitted to me while underway.  The 2016 has a little more leg room inside for taller drivers than the 2006 Cayman I owned previously. The fuel consumption is very good, even 28 mpg at highway speeds. It averages 18mpg overall. If there is anything to complain about, it is that I sometimes get carried away with the amount of fun that I am having while running faster than the posted limits!

porsche,cayman,2016,John, 12/15/2017,An Excellent Sports Car!,5,"This car is a blast to drive! It looks gorgeous at any angle with beautiful lines and dimensions. The 3.4L engine is powerful and sounds amazing (I would definitely recommend the Sport Exhaust!) all the way to its redline! Handling is second to none with so much grip and the feedback from the steering wheel is perfect. With a low curb weight and a stiff chassis, the Cayman does a wonderful job of carving through winding roads all day long. Braking is superb and constant. While not necessarily the import factor in buying a sports car, the gas mileage is pretty good in my opinion for what the car has to offer. I can get in the low 30's on the highway and average about 24 mpg combined (not far off from other 6 cylinder vehicles I have driven). The interior is well laid out  and has plenty of room for occupants (I'm 6'5"" and by no means uncomfortable) though egress in and out can take a little getting used to if you are tall, but this is true of most smaller sport cars. Materials are top notch and the level customization is pretty incredible (though it can get pricey quickly). I love this car and see myself driving it for a long time!

porsche,cayman,2016,Gerald B. B. Keane, 11/17/2015,Best Car I'll Ever Own,5,"Upon retiring, I didn't need a boat-of-a-car anymore, so I decided to downsize.  The Cayman's the perfect choice.  I considered a 911, but, though it's a two-seater, it feels and drives like a bloated Buick.  Although I come from a Lexus family (5 cars, 48 total ownership years), I'm not accustomed to the design and build quality that Cayman gives.  It is rock solid and is a pleasure to drive.  The gas mileage is much better than my last Lexus sports car, and its performance, as expected, blows it away.  I specially ordered a manual transmission and have no regrets--why would anyone want automatic transmission on a sports car?  It's not that easy to get in and out of, but that's the sacrifice you have to make to own a car that catches your eye every time you're near it.  A friend was torn between buying a Corvette or a Porsche, to which my response was ""Why would you consider buying the best hamburger McDonald's makes over a steak at a steak house?""  Corvettes are beautiful cars, but buying one over a Porsche?  No rational person could make that choice.  (The friend ended up cancelling his Corvette order and bought the Porsche.)

I've had my Cayman for 30 months now, and I have no reason to change any of my earlier opinions.  It's worth every penny of what I paid.  Why would anyone buy anything else?

For a serious sports car it rides moderately smooth but not as smooth and quiet as my Audi TT.  But I didn’t buy it to be smooth and quiet.  I bought it for performance and style.  It fit the bill perfectly in both categories.

While a Cayman S doesn’t have the straightline acceleration of a Chevy Corvette, the mid engine Cay will run circles around the “commoners” sport car.

Some of the climate controls don't work as I'd like; always turning on when the car is started even if it was off when the car was stopped, no way to just use the fan without it trying to match the temperature settings.  Nav is less intuitive to use than a Garmin.  I'd prefer less technology overall, less complexity.  A design issue is that they use gravel on the roads here when there's ice and the brakes are susceptible to gravel getting stuck in them causing a scraping sound and possibly need an expensive fix by the dealer, so I find myself limiting my winter driving.  But it's really fun to drive.

porsche,cayman,2016,NW Driver, 11/11/2020,Excellent on the race course,5,"Took my 2016 Cayman S pdk to the race track for a high performance driving course and then last week for lapping. The other reviewers are right in the mark- at 45k miles the car is a great daily driver and a true sports car.
The brakes stop quickly and predictably, and the car is stable at 128mph; and it takes the S turns remarkably well.
My only regrets- not finding one with the sports exhaust, nav and the Chrono package. But the price was right and the car looks brand new- given the build quality.

I replace the seat support but the noise came back after 4 month so basically this seat only can hold up for 4 month. I guess will have to order the seat support parts again and I know this new seat support parts will only last for another 4 month but what the heck. I will just keep order the parts until I sell this junk....(UPDATE) and 2017 I sold this junk

porsche,cayman-s,2006,Tech Guy, 11/14/2006,New Car Impressions,4,"I discovered a new white, brown leather Cayman S in the garage a couple of weeks ago; a gift from my wife to liven up a long commute which it does nicely. It has Bose, heated seats, power seats, all the stuff in the performance package plus and I have put on 610 lawfully driven miles so far with no surprises. The manual says take it easy (keep it under 4,200rpm) for 2,000 miles. That means 1,260 not very exciting miles ahead. After that I can tell it is going to be a sweet ride. Its initial fuel consumption is sky high but should improve. I had the 3M clear bra film installed. The car is tight, supple, loud, sticky, fast and driving it might be the most fun you can have with your clothes on."
porsche,cayman-s,2006,vitoaf, 08/19/2012,Simply Amazing and Still strong at 95k miles,4,"This car is the best daily driver true sports car you will ever own (unless you want to fit more than 2 ppl).
I've driven Lambo, Ferrari, etc... truly amazing cars, but not daily drivers.
 In this car you can fully utilize it's power and agility on the road while having the reliability of a Honda or Toyota.
I'm near the 100k mark and have had no major issues.
You want a safe car? This is it. You have all the tools you need to be an offensive driver and when those tools fail, you are surrounded by airbags to soften the blow. This car will follow your line of sight and place you exactly where you tell it to.
It's an extension of the driver. This could easily be the only car I ever own. "
porsche,cayman-s,2006,charles III, 09/25/2005,Best porshe yet!,4,"This is by far the best car Porshe has made. The performance and handling is utterly amazing. I own a porshe 911, and personally i believe the cayman looks and handles much better, for a much better price.  However this car is not as fast as   my Ferrari 350 modena."
porsche,cayman-s,2006,kent, 10/10/2006,2007 Porsche Cayman S,5,"What an outstanding car!  My last two cars were 'vettes. This car is superior in performance, handling, quality and more fun to drive.  I get compliments everywhere I go.  Definitely get the PASM and spend the extra money on the leather interior - you will be glad you did.  The quality and worksmanship of the full leather is unbelievable. Only get the chrono package if you are going to track the car.  I wish I had chosen the sport shifter, but the stock six-speed shifter is still the best I've driven.  The Carrera 19"" wheels painted in the exterior body color is awesome."
porsche,cayman-s,2006,JC, 08/19/2006,Amazing...,4,"The Porsche Cayman provides really amazing bang for the buck.  This car handles impeccably.  My only compliant is that the car could use a few more horsepower, but I guess they need to protect the Carerra.  It does zero to sixty in 5.1 seconds, which is still pretty darn quick.  It is a blast to drive.  The sound of the engine above 4,,000 rpm is exquisite.  I miss it when I'm not driving.  I would skip the Bose stereo system, but the sport shifter and PASM are recommended.  It looks great in silver, and much better in person than in photos.  I recommend it over the stock Carrera for all around fun, the C4 and turbo versions excepted."
porsche,cayman-s,2006,srryofcr, 08/27/2011,Better than the 911 I have dreamed about,4,"Unlike all other sports cars I have owned or driven my Cayman S loves to dance.
As an instructor for various car clubs I have had the chance to drive many Porsche products the way they were meant to be - on the track.
The Cayman S in stock trim can run with race prepped older 911s and does a great job at hanging with the 997 cars.
In my opinion to get a better track car you'd have to buy a GT3. To boot it has available all the creature comforts that you can afford to add, good economy (28mpg highway in my experience), and is a comfortable cruiser for 2 for the weekend.
It gets looks all day long, as they are ""rare""."
porsche,cayman-s,2006,Mouseclick, 04/14/2006,A True Dream of a Car,4,"I've had my Cayman for two weeks and have put 600 miles on it.  The car is a dream all the way around - loaded with PASM, Navigation, Bose stereo, heated seats, xeon, 19"", sport chrono pack +, etc.  Get the Nav and the CD can play MP3s, although just in a single drive.  The Bose upgrade is worth every penny.  It sounds better than my Bose system in the house.  It's quick and sticks to the ground so well.  Plus it is a true head turner!!  The cup holders require fully covered lids and ""small"" sizes, unless you want to spill on your beautiful leather seats.  I wish the steering wheel were just a bit smaller (probably an option).  But all in all, I'd buy this car all over again.  Oh what fun.  And that engine sound - WOW!"
porsche,cayman-s,2006,Fadiboy, 08/29/2006,There Really is no Substitute,5,"I have to say I have always been a practicality guy when it comes to cars and depreciating items.  This car beats my reason into submission and gets me on an adrenaline program.  Its build quality is beyond what you would ever see in almost any other mark.  The ride is like a rollercoaster that will not leave the track and the look is more exotic than anything Porsche has made in recent history. As Ferris Bueller said ""If you have the money, I highly recommend it.""  The engine noise is a sweet tune and the grip is like nothing else.  The seats are better than most aftermarket models and the curves of the body almost make you blush. It looks great in every color they make, leaving you smiling. "
porsche,cayman-s,2006,lee ohanian, 12/15/2006,Almost the Perfect Sports Car,4,"The Cayman has incredible handling due to its mid-engine design.  It is more fun to drive than cars that cost twice as much. It has excellent acceleration, though the car needs to be at least in the 3,000 rpm range for peak performance. "
porsche,cayman-s,2006,ron lewis, 02/01/2007,Cayman S Overview,5,"So far my Cayman S has averaged 25-28 mpg.  You must use premium fuel in it.  It has very firm seats.  You must be careful of moving the passenger seat all the way back.  It will activate airbag warning system. The dark tinted rear window makes it difficult to see out back.  The buttons on the key activate the trunk and engine lids too easily.  You must be very careful of potholes in the road, the rims are easily damaged due to their low profile.  They are expensive to replace or repair.  This car is really fun to drive.  It delivers exhilarating performance above 4,000 rpm,  It has a low ground clearance, so you must be aware of debris on roads and in driveways.  It is easy to strike the undercarriage. "

so at @ 22000mi. It was using MORE!!
Turns out the motor was tearing itself to pieces when they said it was normal .. so out of warrantee it needs a motor. 
PORSCHE DID THE RIGHT THING AND replaced the motor.. it still cost me big.. But thats beside the point. I bought this car as a sportscar I can enjoy everyday. This motor only lasted as long as the tires. Its serviced reg. not tracked and stock.. not the robust car I thought I bought.Now my dream cars a nightmare and I don't know what to do with it. afarid to drive it over 22K"

porsche,cayman-s,2006,Michael, 03/26/2006,Only Minor Complaints,4,"Buy this car.  It's awesome.  It's the only car that I have purchased in my life with NO regrets.  I would buy it again today without hesitation, but these need to be fixed for 2007 / 2008:  Interior cabin noise is loud.  When driving on the weekends that's great (it's a sports car afterall), but Wednesday afternoon with a client on the phone ain't so cool!  Callers often ask if I'm in a convertable.  No audible horn or noise when locking and unlocking the vechicle from the exterior with the fob.  You have to watch for two blicks of the lights when locking which can be difficult to see in the sun.  Rear hatchback button on fob is TOO big.  I accidently open the rear hatch a lot!"
porsche,cayman-s,2006,Aaron Sprague, 04/07/2006,A Love Affair,4,"A car that is the essential sports coupe, its more nimble than a ballet dancer and hotter than a super model. This car is balanced to perfection. On short rides in traffic you feel like a jockey on a race horse surrounded by mules, on long rides where you can really open the car up. Turn off the radio and enjoy the music of the 295hp engine singing to you... It says go! Go Faster! Take the long way home!!!"
porsche,cayman-s,2006,MiamiBice, 04/21/2006,Simply the Best,4,"You drive it once and you can't live without it. The Cayman is built to last and drive! If you are a serious sports car fan, this is your dream car."
porsche,cayman-s,2006,esaam ismail, 07/25/2006,Possibly My Last Car,4,"Since 1992 I've owned the following cars: two twin turbo Toyota Supras, three Acura NSXs, a Honda S2000, and four BMW M3s.  I've driven all these cars on the Sebring race track and I was completely blown away by the Cayman S.  The handling, power (especially in low gears), the clutch/gearbox, and brakes are phenominal.   I was convinced that I was getting the new Z4 M Coupe, but I was lucky enough to have a dealership that had both cars to drive.  I drove them 30 minutes apart and the Cayman S was beyond better in every area (except cup holder).  I found the car with the options I wanted and had it home one week later."
porsche,cayman-s,2006,draya, 01/26/2006,Love at first drive...,5,"First let me start by saying I built my Cayman on-line months before it was available. I almost didn't get it because when I called the dealer they said that all there cars were spoken for. Anyway I went into the dealer on the first day and they actually had a car the way I wanted, without all the extra bells and whistles. This car has muscle, it's been 20 years since my last Porsche and this car sets the standard. It handles great, its mileage is decent, and the comfort is good. The Cayman gets a lot of looks.  I've gotten many of nods of approval, and best of all I feel great. I finally know what it's like to be in the garage at night, washing the windows and dusting it off. "
porsche,cayman-s,2006,NAMYAC, 03/16/2006,Affordable 911,4,"If you are trying to muster the financial gumption to buy a 911, stop in the Cayman department of your local Porsche dealer and examine the Cayman. For most of you, this is all the performance you need.  I am not sure I can drive it to its full capabilities.  Fun, good looking, a dream to drive and a lot less than a 911. Amazingly good ride for a short wheel base. Very cool cockpit and an intoxicating engine sound.  Great value dollar for dollar."
porsche,cayman-s,2006,Porsche For Life, 04/13/2006,More Fun than any other Car Owned,4,"I recently purchased a Cayman S after reading many reviews.  I considered a 911 but test drove this car and was sold instantly. Just last night another driver pulled up besides to give me a thumbs up. Its so much fun to drive that I have to wipe the smile on my face after each drive.  I have driven it about 2,000 miles in all conditions. I just returned from a weekend road trip and it performed flawlessly.  Its handling and control were awesome at all speeds!  It had enough room for luggage and packages purchased with room to spare."
porsche,cayman-s,2006,Donelonpc, 10/28/2006,Watch out 911,4,"I have driven BMWs for years now, but wanted more pure sports car for the track.  This car was just plain awesome on the 2.5 mile Heartland Park road course.  Porsche has to be under rating the speed and horsepower numbers on this car for fear of losing 911 sales.  If Porsche wanted to tweak it some more, this car and engine could blow the 911 out of the water.  This is a great car, hands down.  It puts a smile on my face every time I drive.  It's friendly as an everyday driver too."

porsche,cayman-s,2006,Porsche #5, 09/01/2008,Flawless,5,The Cayman S is best all around Porsche I have ever owned. The quality is excellent. The Cayman S is well balanced between power and handling. Great roadablity around town and when I select the PASM and it is outstanding. And the servicing is only 2 year or 20K.
porsche,cayman-s,2006,Larry Craine, 01/05/2007,"""Performance car of the year!""",5,"The Cayman S has great performance and is truly fun to drive.  I have driven Maserati, Aston Martin, and Ferrari, but this is one of my favorites.  I have always been a Porsche fan.  It's easy to drive and has a great sleek design.  The great thing about the Cayman S is it looks much more expensive than the car is priced.  The only other car I have driven that comes close is the Maserati Quattroporte and the Aston Martin Vanquish.  I love my Cayman S."

porsche,cayman-s,2006,3ToothCat, 03/01/2006,Exceeded Any Expectations,4,"My Porsche Cayman S is extremely fast, yet gives you extreme control. There is no waiting for the power to come. At 4,000 rpm and onward, it's just an animal.  Porsche provides any exterior and interior color combinations one would possibly want. This is a good thing and a bad thing. It may be too hard to commit to just one. The view of the rear end is just captivating, the car shows different lines at every angle. There'll always be someone calling it ""Boxster Coupe."" Don't let that get to you, if you're going to get one, because it is and it isn't. It's so much tighter and sportier than the Boxster, let alone the practicality aspect."
porsche,cayman-s,2006,JJ, 03/11/2006,Great Car,4,"I just picked up my Cayman as a weekend car.  So far it hasn't disappointed.  Had a minor computer error relating to the passenger airbag, but it cleared up by wiggling the seat around.  I chose a pretty plain package- wanted it for performance vs. bells and whistles.  The car definitely will get looks- even had someone snap a picture from their phone at a stoplight.   I am 6'1"" and legroom is a little tight if driving for much more than 1 hour.  This thing is a rocket- Drive it like you stole it!"
porsche,cayman-s,2006,Alexk, 03/29/2006,Surprisingly Quiet and Smooth Ride,4,I was very surprised to find that this car is very quiet (for a sports car). The ride with PASM is also very smooth.  The whole ownership experience has been pleasant and the car has so far been very reliable with no service incidents.
porsche,cayman-s,2006,A.Naik, 05/04/2006,better than 911!,5,"The Cayman is one great coupe! I was going to order a MZ4 Coupe, but after seeing it at the auto show, no way. The Cayman S is way better looking and if you can afford one this is the best sports coupe for the buck!  This is my second Porsche, it is far superior to the base 911."
porsche,cayman-s,2006,Bluesmaster, 05/08/2006,Smooth,4,"After three weeks and 1,250 miles, I can honestly say this is the finest car I've ever driven. It has fabulous looks and handling and it is very comfortable with lots of room for a 2 seater. The brakes are wonderful, shifter like butter, and the engine sounds are awesome. I don't mind a long drive in this car, and everyone loves it wherever you go. The car has no bad habits."
porsche,cayman-s,2006,Silvio, 05/19/2006,Smile from ear to ear,4,"The Porsche Cayman is a PURE JOY to drive.  It has a completely different feel that the Boxster S (the car I traded in) and in my opinion more fun than a 911 and more forgiving to drive.  The Bose stereo, xenon, heated seats, 19"" etc are musts - I had to settle for no nav as this was an unplanned purchase.  I was stuck in traffic by the dealership and they let me test drive the car / fall in love / have to have it / drive it home scenario."
porsche,cayman-s,2006,Tin18cup, 07/11/2006,Awesome Car,5,My 2006 Porsche Cayman has been an incredible all around sports car - not just for performance but for its ease of use around the city.
porsche,cayman-s,2006,Memo, 07/21/2006,Best of the Best,4,"This is my third Porsche after a Boxster and a 911. This is the best performer and most stylish Porsche ever built. It is fun and powerful. If you are not a porfessional driver with access to a speedway, this is the best Porsche you can get and enjoy every single drive. "
porsche,cayman-s,2006,JM, 07/24/2006,Fabulous Driver's Car,4,This is the best driver's Porsche south of a 911 RS. The mid-engined layout offers balance and feedback to the driver which is matched only by a Lotus Exige (the difference being that you can get in and out of the Cayman without being a contortionist). It looks much better in the metal than in photographs and the looks grow on you too. Buy it in red or black - rather spend your money on the PASM active suspension option than pay for metallic paint. If you see someone driving a 911 you're never sure if they have bought it for the image - you can be sure the Cayman owner bought it for sheer thrill of driving. 
porsche,cayman-s,2006,dacrunk, 07/27/2006,Two Cars in One,5,"I purchased my Cayman S 2 1/2 weeks ago and have driven 2,150 miles to date. What an awesome machine!  Putt around town, in traffic and keep the rpm below 4,000 rpm and you have a very docile, easy to drive pussy cat...put your foot into it and it becomes a TIGER above 4,500 rpm. I chose the car for it's styling, handling and engineering and it has far surpassed any expectations I had! To me this machine is a culmination of the very best of every Porsche ever made! Next time I'll pass on the Bose system, as I find the bass a bit too flabby for my taste. For those who want more power, try the driving school, as the race track is the ONLY place you might need more power."

porsche,cayman-s,2006,CMM, 02/10/2006,It's a Sweet Ride,5,"I've had my Porsche Cayman for three weeks now.  It's physically a very beautiful car that was designed by engineers.  I think the most outstanding aspect is that it is so well balanced.  Having the sweet sounding engine mounted aft of your head provides music to the ears (it is not overbearing at all).  I chose a lighter paint job (silver) so one can appreciate the beautiful lines.  I saw a medium seal grey metallic type paint at the dealer that I thought looked even better than mine.  I'd venture that the most common color chosen is silver.  The car turns heads, but that isn't why I got it (I'd actually prefer an invisible car).  I got it because it appeared to be the best sports car for less than $100,000."
porsche,cayman-s,2006,crfrk, 02/21/2006,Cayman S,5,"As pretty as it is, the Porsche Cayman S drives and corners better. I have absolutly no complaints other than a removable engine cover would have been nice. I believe it will live up to all of the write ups I have been reading about it for the last three years.  Where do I go from here?"

It proves to be the perfect car for daily commuting through town, touring along the Cornice and of course, the somewhat higher speed runs on the highways through the country. I am looking forward to take it out on the race track!"
porsche,cayman-s,2006,namyac, 03/17/2006,911 Detour,4,"If you are out shopping for a 911 stop  by the Cayman department at your local porsche dealer first and save a lot of money. There is so many good things about this car. Terrific handling, to die for cockpit, intoxicating sound and performance, gorgeous looks. My first drive was a 650 mile drive through the mountain west and was as much fun as humans should be allowed to have.  This car, dollar for dollar is just about the best thing going.  I would love to have a 911 some day, but it may be a while because I love this Cayman."
porsche,cayman-s,2006,A.D., 03/31/2006,"Wow, what a ride!",5,"Until now, I've been a BMW guy.  Now, I think I am a permanent Porsche convert.  This car is like a second skin and performs like a dream.  I am 6'1"", 220 and the seats are so well designed that you just settle in and enjoy.  The exterior design is the best I have seen and the throwback style is very distinctive.  The handling on small country roads, with tight turns is superb and on the highway the car is a beast!  I will enjoy this car for many years.  I understand now why so many 911 fans like the Cayman S more.  It is pure fun!  Now, if only I can get the tires to last beyond 5,000 miles..."

The Cayman is fast and handles well. I bought it with Tiptronic. It is mainly used in a manual mode and it goes!  I hope to take it on a long drive i.e., through the mountains real soon. This is a fun car to drive!"
porsche,cayman-s,2006,K-Man S, 05/29/2006,Fantastic!,5,"I am the PCA Cayman Register chairman and as such have extensive experience with this car, having owned my personal one since Jan of 2006.  The car is an excellent combination of power, agility and engineering.  Pictures don't do it justice, you really need to drive this car to appreciate it.  I have done several track days with this car and it far and away exceeds my expectations every time.  Porsche - There is no substitute!"
porsche,cayman-s,2006,zedd06, 06/10/2006,No Substitue,5,"Fellow owners have already expressed my thoughts.  I do not have anything more to add other than this is an incredible handling car for the money.  The 10-11 pm side profile is absolutely gorgeous!  The 12 noon (head on) profile is stunning!

There is no comparison between the Boxster S and Cayman S....the Cayman blows it away,  It has much better performance and handling and a sleeker style.  The styling is so incredible that everywhere I go I get compliments on the car.  "
porsche,cayman-s,2006,Scott , 06/14/2006,Cayman is Superb,4,"The Cayman's gorgeous exterior and interior have drawn more appreciative comments than any car I've owned.  The optional leather interior is worth the (high) price, as are the more attractive 19"" wheels and the sport seats and steering wheel.  The chrono looks good, but like the Sport package is worthwhile only if you plan for track use.  Its power is especially good at high RPM, ok at low RPM too but not like my Z06 Corvette.  The engine sound is exhilarating but can get tiring on the highway.  The optional stereo is excellent. "
porsche,cayman-s,2006,P Lo, 07/18/2006,Cayman S,4,"In one word ""BALANCE.""  The Cayman is not the fastest Porsche out there, but it is the most balanced Porsche out there. Its handling combined with it's 295HP motor makes it the best driving Porsche to date. Its fit and finish is right up there with the 997s, and it is likely better looking than the 997. I added the Short Shift Kit from Porsche after delivery made and that made it even sweeter to drive.  I can say there isn't a better sports car out there for under $120,000 that can touch it."
porsche,cayman-s,2006,CC, 09/29/2006,What a Car,5,The Porsche Cayman S is extremely fun to drive.  It definitely makes you feel young and energetic.

The Caymen S doesn't have the brute power of the vette, but with the mid engine you feel like you are part of the road and in control.

porsche,cayman-s,2006,Silvio, 03/28/2007,Ten months of pure joy,5,"Second review - it's been 10 months and the sheer exhilaration of driving the Cayman S  is unabated.  From the looks of the car to the sweet notes of the exhaust when you redline the car to the cornering ability - pure JOY!  It's even fun arguing with all my 911 owner friends which is really the better car (let's not forget Porsche intentionally hit sub 911 performance targets) a real shame, I was under the impression you engineered a car to the most it can be not fit into your marketing campaign, nonetheless my 2nd Porsche and the beginning of a lifelong infatuation with the Cayman S."
porsche,cayman-s,2006,salichtman, 09/20/2007,Porsche finally has it right.,5,"I used to race Porsches and have been waiting for a Porsche that's better than the old 550 RS. I think this one is.  Aside from an urge to drive 2 or 3 times the speed limit, this is a perfect car for me. However, that might not be for everyone. It's delightfully noisy, making the multispeaker radio not very useful at speed and hands-off cell phone calls are pretty nearly impossible.  For a car that handles this well, it's incredibly comfortable. For a car that accelerates so vigorously and has a top speed around 170 mph, it is unbelievably docile in LA freeway traffic jams.  I have about 18,000 miles on her (I name my cars, this one is Chloe) and have had no problems."
porsche,cayman-s,2006,Dougie Fresh, 05/03/2008,06 Cayman S is a winner,4,"The most beautiful Porsche, ever.  It looks great, feels great to drive, sounds great - and that Bose system is just amazing.  Only downside is gas mileage."

isuzu,amigo,2000,Tammy R, 03/09/2004,Love it!,4,"Gas mileage is horrible on V6, but 
very fun to drive.  Top can come off, 
but it's a hassle.  You only want to 
do it at the beginning and end of 
summer, as it will need a new gasket 
each time.  

Tows like a champ.  V6 will tow 4,500 
lbs.  Tows my 18' bass boat, no 
problem."
isuzu,amigo,2000,hbc, 05/12/2004,Excellent vehicle,4,"Excellent vehicle, fun to drive, 
comfortable ride, very reponsive, very 
well designed, great warrantee"
isuzu,amigo,2000,chris, 10/04/2005,Crash Test Dummy,4,"I only owned this Amigo for 6 hours.  I was driving it home when a 2002 Ford F150 turned in front of me.  I was going 50 mph.  The collision was nearly head-on at somewhere between 60 and 80 mph.  The Amigo held up great! All the damage was in front of the passenger compartment.  I was in the hospital for 2 days for observation due to concussion, but I am definitely getting another Amigo.  Thank you to the engineers at Isuzu!  I'm also going to get one for my teenage son."
isuzu,amigo,2000,Mike, 03/31/2006,Isuzu rules the world of real trucks!,4,I have owned the truck for 5.5 years and I still love it.  No problems to date (75K); it still has the original brake pads.  I have the factory hard top which is easy to remove and replace with the factory soft-top in the summer.
isuzu,amigo,2000,DMS329, 05/28/2008,I Love my Amigo!,4,"For a small 6-cyl SUV, it really cranks it up when I need to merge onto the interstate and handles great when I need to take evasive measures to avoid someone not looking when they are changing lanes.  These Amigos were built to last since they were originally built for off-roading.  I closed up the back seats so I can haul my dogs around to agility trials; I can get two 300 airline crates in it and stack everything else on top of the crates."
isuzu,ascender,2003,MARK ELDRIDGE, 09/04/2003,GREAT VALUE,4,"WE PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE FOR USE AS A 
TOW VEHICLE.
CONSIDERD A YUKON AS ALTERNATIVE ANDD 
FOUND THIS MORE COST EFFECTIVE.
I FOUND ISSUZU STYLING AND TO BE BETTER 
THAN BOTH THE TRAIL BLAZZER OR ENVOY.
WE OPTED FOR THE V8 AND IT RIDES FAR 
BETTER THAN THE 6 CYLIDER. WE ARE 
AVERAGING 18 MPG WITH A CONSIDERABLE 
AMOUNT OF CITY DRIVING.
WE FOUND THIS VEHICLE TO BE ABOUT $4,000
LESS THAN A COPERABLE TRAILBLAZER AND 
ABOUT $6,000 LESS THAN AN ENVOY.
ISUZZU OFFERS DOUBLE THE STANDARD 
WARANTY OF CHEVY OR GMC.
WE HAVE THE LIMITED EDITION WITH EVEY 
OPTION.
BOSE STEREO IS GREAT."
isuzu,ascender,2003,PaulG6373, 01/29/2003,Great Balance-Features and Performance,4,"We test drove many vehicles looking for 
a quality mid-size SUV, Explorers, 2003 
Cherokee's, Mountaineers, Envoy's, etc. 
The last SUV we tested was a beautiful 
black, 2003 Isuzu Ascender Limited (V8 
4WD).it was impressive from the outside 
and even more impressive on the inside. 
Interior is beautifully crafted, of 
great materials, and contained every 
feature we could imagine.. the 3rd row 
seat had plenty of room (unlike 
Explorer's), and the seat folded down 
much better than the one in the 
explorer as well. During the test 
drive, the vehicle handled like a much 
smaller vehicle, with very little body 
roll, road noise, yet with plenty of 
power."
isuzu,ascender,2003,Katmandu-1, 02/17/2003,Great value and a true workhorse,4,"If you like the GMC Envoy XL or the 
Chevy Trailblazer EXT then check out 
the Isuzu.  The Isuzu specific version 
including unique front grill, 
headlights, bumpers, and fenders.  Most 
of all, we liked paying 4 grand less 
than for the GMC/Chevy, and getting a 
better warranty!  We wish front seats 
were not so stiff, but incredible mix 
of interior features more than makes up 
for things."
isuzu,ascender,2003,bebe237i, 10/20/2007,Acender review,4,"My Acender has been wonderful because of the size, we have taken it on many trips. I bought the third row Acender and the extra space is wonderful. The seats are easy to move. I have only had a few mecanical problems window motror, the ac doesn't work on the 5th setting and the clutch fan went out. But the clutch fan was kind of pricey but you can buy the gmc envoy clutch fan, it's cheaper and it's the same part. Other than that I love my Acender."
isuzu,ascender,2003,Jack Sang, 02/09/2003,isuzu Review,5,"I liked the car. It is the best car in 
the world"
isuzu,ascender,2003,robertabf, 07/23/2003,2003 Isuzu Ascender LS 2WD 5.3 V8,4,"Owned an Envoy, but was looking for 
the V8 engine.  The GM 
Envoy/Trailblazer has great front leg 
room for a tall person, so it had to 
be either the Envoy or Trailblazer XL 
models since they are the only ones 
available with the V8.until I saw 
the Ascender that is!...WOW  It is the 
only way to get two-tone paint and 
that really makes it look great.  The 
V8 is very powerful and much more fun 
to drive than the I6.  Very quiet 
running and the ride is great...Really 
appreciate the details put into this 
vehicle.  Great stereo and rear air 
too...I think Isuzu could sell a lot 
more of these if they were more 
available."
isuzu,ascender,2003,csieka, 07/31/2003,go for it,4,"We like this vehicle, however we 
have already had it in for repairs on 
the a/c switch.  It is suposed to have 
a monitor for the life of oil, but the 
mechanic manager said we should 
change oil every 3,000 miles anyway.  
As front passenger sometimes the 
consule proved to be uncomfortable 
when traveling long distances.   
Overall we are still very pleased."
isuzu,ascender,2003,tix6174, 07/20/2003,Surprise!!!,4,"Great vehicle!!
Had already been looking at the Envoy XL
and Trailblazer EXT, but didn't really
care for the stylings of those. Stumbled
across the Ascender here on Edmunds and
discovered it was the same truck, so had
to find one to test drive.  What a
difference!!!
The GMC ""felt"" smaller inside and I
don't like the look of the TB (plus
there are hundreds around here).
The ride was much better too!
So for about $5000 less, I got a better
warranty and up-level options (Limited
minus leather), plus that great V8. "
isuzu,ascender,2003,alb_1974, 08/08/2003,Excellent,4,"So far I have 600 miles on mu Isuzu 
Ascender and I love it, the ride is

inside."
isuzu,ascender,2003,MICAH MAISAMARI, 08/08/2003,Driving fun,4,"Being new and few on the road Iam 
regularly asked about it's handling. I 
tell people how much fun to drive."
isuzu,ascender,2003,markd, 10/22/2003,Buying a car,4,"I have realized why there are not many 
Isuzu Ascenders on the road. Recently I 
went to the dealership and test drove 
one as well as showed interest buying 
one.  My wife and I really liked the 
car, but salesperson did not really 
show much energy to sell one at all.  I 
have called him a couple of times, and 
all I got from him is he will call me 
back very soon, but have not heard
since.  I tried again, but no results.  
It's a good car, but they need to work 
how to sell it.  No adds in the paper 
either escept Demo one which was sold 
(according to the dealership) day 
before it went to the paper. Honda and 
Toyota"
isuzu,ascender,2003,fish98, 11/11/2003,problems,4,"I have 16,000 on my car, so far it has 
been in the shop three times.  The 
power steering Pump and horn relay 
went out and repairs are taking over a 
week.  Unfortunally everytime the car 
breaks, parts have to be order from 
the manufacture.  "
isuzu,ascender,2003,gunter, 03/03/2003,Impressive SUV,4,"I have been test driving SUVs for the 
past 6 months and had decided on the 
Acura MDX.  A friend suggested I check 
out the Isuzu Ascender.  After driving 
both vehicles and comparing styling, 
cargo area, passenger comfort and 
overall value, the Ascender has won me 
over.  It is a much better looking 
vehicle than the MDX both inside and 
out. I felt more comfortable driving 
the Ascender (I am 5ft 2, 118 lbs) and 
I can actually carry other adults in 
the third row.  The gas mileage is 
better on the MDX, but the MDX lacks 
the style and comfort of the Ascender."
isuzu,ascender,2003,JARED KEYS, 12/30/2003,Great vehicle with a cars drivabilty,4,"I like this vehicle already! Wish is 
were mine. Purchased it for my wife 
(kid mobile) because it is large and 
safe on the roads yet has the driving 
feel of a car.  I feel confortable 
knowing they are safe while I am not 
with them and if a problem occurs 
ONSTAR is there to the rescue!"
isuzu,ascender,2003,Alfred T. Child, 03/24/2006,2003 Isuzu Ascender Ltd,4,Better interior lighting is needed.
isuzu,ascender,2003,Isuzu owner, 04/07/2004,Great value,3,"This is truly a wonderful value. The LS 
is loaded with goodies I would never 
pay for and I got it for a steal at 
25k,and low interest rate. The interior 
could use some dressing up, but for an 
active family the Ascender meets all my 
requirments.  Not to many on the road 
and my wife is asked often about the 
SUV.  Carbon Copy of Envoy, but lower 
cost and exterior is more appealing."
isuzu,ascender,2003,mark076, 06/14/2004,2003 Envoy Limited,4,"Was Looking for a GMC Envoy but the 
Isuzu had a much better exterior kit 
on it.  "
isuzu,ascender,2003,shumuzu, 07/04/2004,Should have known better...,1,"Bought Ascender in Feb.'03 & 
was in the shop by March, and at least 
6-8 times since. The a/c odors (could 
not sit in the car until we blew out 
the system with all the windows down.) 
Repaired 10/03,still smells.  There 
are many interior parts inferior in  
quality.  THe gear shifter came off in 
my hand, stearing wheel whines,plastic 
compartments won't shut/open properly, 
the radio/cd player has been replaced 
1 time,& parts have again been ordered 
for a repair.The ""old pick-up truck"" 
rusty, screachy sound they can't seem 
to find. Although anyone riding in or 
near the car can here us coming!  "
isuzu,ascender,2003,djsiek, 09/20/2004,Piece of Junk,1,"It is a good thing Isuzu gives an extended warranty.  
You will need it.  We have had one electrical 
problem after another.  Because these problems are 
not the same in 3 or more cases we can not say this 
falls under the lemon laws of our state, but believe 
me we consider this car to be a lemon.  The front 
passenger seat is extremely uncomfortable.  The 
maximum gas mileage we have been able to get is 
17mpg.  Several exterior pieces are plastic and 
extremely easy to damage. Within 6 months of 
buying this vehicle started having squeaks that 
sound like loosing of hinges etc..  Do Not Buy an 
Isuzu Ascender if you are smart."
isuzu,ascender,2003,mesnsbs, 05/13/2003,The Best SUV Out There,4,"After testing different SUV, me & my 
husband decided to get the Acura MDX.  
One day we road past a Isuzu dealership 
& saw a new SUV.  We made a u-turn to 
go back to see what it was & fell in 
love with the Ascender.  After test 
driving it we knew we found what we 
were looking for, especially the price. "
isuzu,ascender,2003,Scottl29, 01/15/2003,One great SUV!,4,"I purchased a 2002 axiom and had it end 
up being a lemon. Don't believe that it 
can really tow what it saws. I towed my 
boat at 2500 lbs total and it bent the 
axles, ruined the brakes, and had 
problems with the drive shaft. I 
stepped up on trade to the Ascender. 
Awesome. You can tell it is 
manufactured differently. A lot 
sturdier, more power, and more 
comfortable as well. I love everything 
about this SUV and would buy another 
one in a heart beat!"
isuzu,ascender,2003,her suv, 03/19/2003,Ascender the Undiscovered Gem,5,"If you are looking for a large SUV to 
transport 7 adults comfortable while 
riding in the lap of luxury, then the 
Ascender is for you.  The exterior and 
interior designs are well defined and 
impressive.  This SUV does everything 
but brew your coffee in the morning.  
The mileage is very good, I am 
averaging 18.5 in city driving.  The 
warrantees on the Ascender are better 
than almost all other large SUV's.    "

far, but this feels like a quality 
piece of work.  Everything about this 
auto is smooth and quite.  The ride is 
great."
isuzu,ascender,2003,J Bolen, 07/06/2003,A Diamond in the rough!,5,"My son plays travel ice hockey and we 
put some serious miles on a vehicle.  
We drove several SUV's and were leaning 
torwards the Trail Blazer.  A major 
factor in that desicion was that I am 
very close friends with the son of the 
owner of the dealership.  My wife 
stumbled across the Isuzu on a fluke, 
and she was hooked.  We test drove it 
and bought it the next day.  Needless 
to say, I had some explainging to do to 
my friend at the Chevy dealership.  If 
you don't at least try this 
vehicle...you are missing out!"
isuzu,ascender,2003,Caryn, 07/04/2003,We love it!,4,"We just got the LS with the optional 
V8.  It's so great to get an Isuzu 
with so many fun American car 
features.  We love the controls on the 
steering wheel.  The V8 is very 
responsive and peppy.  We haven't 
towed with it yet, but I'm looking 
forward to trying it.  We've driven 
just about everything else out there 
and nothing seems to compare for the 
money."
isuzu,ascender,2004,skyye, 03/12/2009,RIP ASCENDER :(,4,"My husband & I purchased our Ascender March 08, it being a car thats not really common we had our doubts but was exactly what we were looking for. We never had any problems on it except for an electrical problem which is common on these cars. When making sure this was the right car to purchase I searched reviews & found the most informative ones on this site so I wanted to make sure that I added my thoughts of this car on here but most importantly how well it handles in accidents. Last week my husband was involved in an accident with a drunk driver which totaled our Ascender but it handled extremely well. Definitely a 10 on safety!! "

has provided comfort, good mileage, and
a lot of flattering comments from per-
sons who had not seen an Ascender 
before. It has all the extras that I 
could ask for including an outstanding
warranty."
isuzu,ascender,2004,Laverna Lopez, 05/24/2016,Going on 12 years together...,5,"I bought this car brand new in 2005. I have always had an Isuzu, my husband and I would buy a new one for me every 3 years. My 2004 ascender has moved to 3 states with me in the last 12 years, has over 177,000 miles and still runs great. Have never had to use my AAA in 12 years nor my Insurance. Have thought numerous times about trading it in and getting something new but I've never had a single issue with this vehicle ever..I've kept up maitance on it and have never had to take it in for any issues AT ALL! This is the best most reliable car  I have ever owned!!
"
isuzu,ascender,2004,winniemt, 02/11/2008,Excellent SUV on and off road,4,"This SUV has been fantastic.  It drives like a truck on the highway, but off-road, it's phenomenal.  Took it up a narrow, rocky, rutted pass over the Brider Mountains in Montana just for fun.  It must be called Ascender because it can - ascend, that is.  Went straight up the mountain like it was nothing!  Beautiful and comfortable, too.  Perfect for Montana winters."
isuzu,ascender,2004,Penny Conners, 06/29/2005,Isuzu Fan deeply disappointed,2,"After owning a Rodeo for 8 yrs with 160,000 trouble free miles. I was excited about my new Ascender. Noticed roaring noise from start and noted with dealership and Isuzu new owner survey. By March whole new rear end was installed.  Still roars as of 6/2005.  Dealership still waiting on tools? Oil sending unit now bad and on order.  Dealership is a nightmare and the Owner Assistance hotline with Isuzu useless! I'm a very disappointed owner who is no longer a fan. Shame on Isuzu!"
isuzu,ascender,2004,fivekids, 01/24/2004,Cool look,4,"I just got my Ascender, instead of an 
Envoy, it was much cheaper. Pros- love 
the Fake wood! My extended package S is 
all I need. My kids love it! Tons of 
power, quick little thing for a big 
car. Great for highways. Cons- Switches 
for heat are a little loose, however, 
and I had to get a new starter right 
away."
isuzu,ascender,2004,Chelo, 01/31/2004,SUV Dream,4,"I purchased my 2004 Ascender Jan 2. It 
caught my eye - exterior/interior 
design, Isuzu's reliability, quality & 
performance - Sweet & Fully loaded! As 
for fuel economy - the mileage is 
almost the same as my Lexus ES 300 - 
just a few bucks a week. And, my 
insurance is a few buck more than my ES 
300 because of all the safety features! 
I enjoy driving my Ascender as much as 
my Lexus - which is now parked in my 
garage! Austin's traffic is like an 
obstacle course & wild - I feel much 
safer in my Ascender!
 "
isuzu,ascender,2004,tom grunden, 02/16/2004,A smooth and quiet ride with value,4,"We looked at most of the larger SUV's 
before buying last winter. We decided 
on the Ascender strictly on the basis 
of highway ride coupled with price. We 
found nothing in the market close in 
this combination without adding $6,000 
to $10,000 to the purchase price. "

than the Trailblazer, plus the warranty

around. Even our base model is very 
well equipped, and a warranty so long 
we'll never have to worry about costs. 
A base price that competes with small 
SUVs, and gives so much. The interior 
is elegant, with woodtrim, and the 
console is very easy to read. The 3rd 
seat is huge even for adults, and 
useful cargo space in back. The 
exterior look is commanding and 
stylish, and catches eyes on the road. 
Dont settle for anything less than the

an even lower price!!! :)"

vehicle is not widely marketed, I'm 
very impressed with the soft ride.  It 
has excellent pick-up and pull away 
speed."
isuzu,ascender,2004,ISACC, 06/05/2004,ASCENDER IS AN AWESOME PURCHASE!!!,4,"I COMPARED THE ASCENDER TO A HONDA 
PILOT, CHEVY TRAILBLAZER AND GMC 
ENVOY. I DID EXTENSIVE RESEARCH AND MY 
CHOICE WAS BASED ON WARRENTY, PRICE OF 
VEHICLE AND BIGGER BANG FOR THE BUCK.
I CONTACTED 6 DEALERSHIPS & HAD THEM 
COMPETE AGAINST EACH OTHERS ""OFFER"". 
THEY WERE FIGHTING FOR MY BUSINESS, I 
DID NOT STRESS OR WORRY, THE PHONE 
RANGED EVERY FEW HOURS & EACH TIME IT 
WAS A ISUZU SALESPERSON DROPPING THE 
PRICE OF THE VEHICLE. AFTER ONLY 3 
DAYS OF PRICE WARS, I BOUGHT A LIMITED 
7 PASS FOR ONLY $28,500 FROM MILI 
GORDON DEALERSHIP IN OKLAHOMA. I DID 
NOT DO ANY FINACING WITH THE 
DEALERSHIP. THE VEHICLE HAD ONLY 10 
MILES ON IT.
EMAIL ME IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS."
isuzu,ascender,2004,Rich1mck7, 06/17/2004,Best Buy,4,"We have had our Ascender for just over 
2 months and WE LOVE IT! We compared it 
with the Pilot, Trailblazer, Durango 
and Murano. It was very clear to us 
that the Ascender was the best all 
around deal for the money! Our 7 
passenger LS came with sunroof, 5 disc 
cd player, rear ac, onstar, pw, plocks, 
and top luggage rack. Our color is 
black & grey with greyish cloth 
interior. After the $3500 rebate we 
bought ours for $26500 plus ttt. We 
financed with for four years with 4.5% 
interest using Capitol One online auto 
finance which was easy, fast and worked 
out great!  "
isuzu,ascender,2004,Greg Thorton, 07/02/2004,WOW! What you need and more.....,5,"All we can say is wow. It has 
everything we need and our luxurious 
Limited model was less than Envoy's 
base model. Plus the warranty is 
really great. No problems in our six 
months of ownership, we are very very 
pleased. The interior is much more 
pleasing than the bland Hondas. Most 
people who own an Ascender as just as 
happy as us. The powerful engine makes 
highway driving a breeze and city 
driving safer. Plus, it looks 
beautiful. People stare it it and they 
ask waht it is, because it looks so 
nice and luxurious. Compare it to any 
other SUV and it wins. Best kept 
secret SUV!!!! Visit Isuzus website!!!"
isuzu,ascender,2004,Paul126, 07/20/2004,the first 1000 miles,4,"Don't understand why Editors rate this
truck at a 6.6.  I traded dwon from a
Suburban, and I find it a great vehicle.
 Handles well, has a nice short turniing
radius, the seats are comfortable and
it's just the right size. I do miss the
Burb's arm rests however!,  Yes, the
suspension is a bit spongy.......gas
shocks may help that situation.  But
otherwise, I'm lovin' this SUV."
isuzu,ascender,2004,berndogsurfer, 08/07/2004,Best Car So Far,4,"Much better looking than a GMC Envoy.  Has style 
to it.  A real touch of Class.  I have the preferred 
equipment package and that is just right for me.  I 
highly recommend it.  Looks great in gold."
isuzu,ascender,2004,Buzzard, 09/01/2004,Give it a chance!!,4,"If you don't have one;GET ONE!! Same 
as Trailblazer & Envoy.Better warranty 
and price.Same engine,same 
transmission.If you are considering 
Chevy or GMC,it would be worth your 
time to check one out.I have 4 
kids.has plenty of room."
isuzu,ascender,2004,Akbar , 09/25/2004,Excellent SUV with lots of room,5,"This is an excellent SUV. I tried out
Honda Pilot, Tahoe and found this one to
be among the best in its class. The ride
is unbelievable, very smooth and yet the
engine spits out 275 Hp."
isuzu,ascender,2004,GSA, 09/29/2004,Best bang for the buck,4,"I have owned this SUV for a month. 
Orignally wanted the GMC ENVOY. Guess 
what its the same SUV. The big 
difference is the Isuzu comes with a 
better warranty and costs less. Its a 
no brainer. I also like the looks of 
the isuzu better. The only real 
differnce is the front grill and 
lights. Plenty of horse power and 
great to load up the family into."
isuzu,ascender,2004,Tmon7765, 10/05/2004,What is an Ascender?,4,"We sure didn't know.  We had been out 
looking for a new utility vehicle for 
the family and work for a little over 
two weeks and almost settled for a 
Mitsubishi Montero Limited.  Now don't 
get me wrong I own two already a 1991 
(still running strong) and a Sport 
2000.  We needed something bigger and 
newer.  We looked at GMC, Ford, Toyota 
and Nissan until we found a small add 
on the internet for an Ascender.  We 
went to our local dealer and were 
amazed at the size and amount of 
equipment being offered for the price.  
Well 48 hours (weekend) later we drove 
off in ours.  Great buy!  Well worth 
your investment, take a look."
isuzu,ascender,2004,Jodie, 10/09/2004,Review,4,"Love driving this vehicle.....Have had 
no problems with it....I would change 
some features in the interior, such as 
arm rest in the front seat areas, that 
is the only negative thing that I have 
to say about it."
isuzu,ascender,2004,Gerrie, 10/23/2004,Riding In Style,4,"I really love the way the isuzu handles 
the road. I have a really smooth ride."
isuzu,ascender,2004,postal worker, 10/14/2004,I like it!,4,"I traded up from a Jeep Cherokee Sport 
model 4x4, so the handling, ride and 
quiet interior really shows up to me.  
I drove a lot of SUVs while I was 
shopping for this, and comparing 
quality, comfort and price, I am 
extremely happy with the value of this 
vehicle."
isuzu,ascender,2004,sirrundmc, 10/29/2004,Very Impressed,5,"This SUV is unreal. I am so impressed
with the quality and make of the
vehicle.  Roominess is an
understatement. The quality of this
vehicle is beyond my expectations.  I
use to own a Chevy Suburban and I swore
up and down I would never buy another
American made car.  But even though this
car is American made, it has the quality
of a Japanese made car without the price
or the shortcomings in roomyiness.
This SUVis the secret of 2004."
isuzu,ascender,2004,J in SD, 11/01/2004,Great Deal,4,"I checked out the Ford Explorer, GMC 
Envoy, and Isuzu Ascender.  Preferred 
Envoy/Ascender over the Explorer and 
neither could touch the deal I got 
w/the Ascender.  On similar equipped 
Envoy I couldn't get the dealer under 
30k. I picked up my Ascender for just 
over 23k on almost the exact same 
vehicle and received a better warranty."
isuzu,ascender,2004,Billy Dwyer, 12/30/2004,Good so far,3,"We traded in a 2002 Ford Explorer. The 
Ascender rides smoother and has more 
options than the aforementioned.  I 
like the towing capabilities and 
options that are available on the 
Ascender.  So far we have no complaints."
isuzu,ascender,2004,randr, 01/02/2005,Better than the rest,4,"Searched and test drove all the other
SUV's on the market , nothing else came
close to the Ascender. My neighbour
traded in his new Tahoe as soon as he
seen my Ascender, this vehicle should be
rated much higher amongst the others."
isuzu,ascender,2004,Albert Cepeda, 01/02/2005,2004 Izusu Ascender,4,"I had been driving Toyota's for the
last 12 years. I have had a 4 Runner
which had a very rough ride and was 
looking for an SUV that would handle 
better,and more like a car and 
still have the SUV look. After 
reviewing several models. I noticed that
the Izusu was built in the GM Plant at
Moraine Oh and shares the same body 
frame as the GMC Envoy and Buick Rainer
but each of these is priced several 
thousands more and the Isuzu has a 7 
year 75000 mile warranty while the GM
versions only have 3 years 36 months.
I thought the Izusu was a great value
for the money.   I dressed mine up with
dealer installed Leather seats (The 
Izusu leather is cheesy at best) it 
really made vehicle."
isuzu,ascender,2004,Kirk, 01/06/2005,Treasure found,3,"My wife and I looked for weeks for our 
first SUV.  The Tribute, Escape, Pilot, 
CRV, RAV4 and more...
The styling of the Ascender caught our 
eye, we test drove it, it was great, 
roomier than many other SUV's at much 
higher $$$. Our children thought it 
looked and drove awesome. It is basic 
but pretty inside, and quiet.  The 
final price was wonderful, and a great 
warranty. I feel like we made out like 
bandits, thank you Isuzu (GM)."
isuzu,ascender,2004,Kedar, 03/25/2005,Best value for money in the class,4,"Smooth, comfortable ride. Third row seat actually usable by adults. Plenty of room. In terms of features available for the price, second to none other in the class of large SUVs."
isuzu,ascender,2004,Airport Guy, 06/29/2007,Great midsize SUV,4,"Coming up on three years and this has been a great vehicle. No service issues at all. Nice style, great ride, roomy and comfortable interior, good equipment packages. Would definitely recommend!"
isuzu,ascender,2005,JOHN TROKA, 02/23/2016,Love my Assender S 4x4.,5,"I have had my Isuzu Ascender for 11 years now and the only thing that went wrong is the gas gauge stopped working and the speakers on the passenger side stopped working that's it, rides great , quiet ride, good gas mileage 17/25 , pull's trailers great, so far so good, and love the 4x4, 139,000 and running great, running synthetic  oil I feel is the best because it doesn't break down keep's it lubricity.
"
isuzu,ascender,2005,sanabu, 05/03/2008,I would buy a second one!!!,4,"It is a real shame that Isuzu will no longer offer personal automobiles as of January 1, 2009. My 2005 Ascender Limited is probably one of the best buys I have completed based on value and acquisition. I wrote my first review on this car on 6/05. I liked the car then and now I just love it. 72000 miles later the truck still has that new feel. When it was brand new the radio broke and it was fixed by the dealer promptly. Other than that just standard maintenance. Everything works on this SUV. Last time I rated the mileage as a 5. Now I'm rating it as a 7 as the truck will usualy do between 18 to 20 miles per gallon which is not bad for the size of truck that I am driving. No complaints."
isuzu,ascender,2005,Gail ETaylor, 01/08/2010,Great Buy,4,This is my second Asscender. I love them its very dependable I have had this one soon to by 5 years other than regular maintenance only one shop repair has occurred in 5 years. This is the best SUV I have owned. I would recommend it to anyone. 
isuzu,ascender,2005,bamaboy36863, 07/27/2009,Never Again!!,2,"This car has been nothing but problems.  First year we had it, AC motor went out and it took over a week to repair. Blower motor will start to weaken when AC runs for an extended period of time. Third year, speakers in rear and left front began working intermittently or not at all.  At the same time the front passenger, rear driver side and hatch locks have worked intermittently.  Both underneath panels under front seats where seat adjusters are located have broken loose due to inferior construction.  We are NOT rough on this vehicle at all and it has not held up ""cosmetically"".  Engine-wise, no problems, yet."
isuzu,ascender,2005,mysuzuki, 01/10/2014,"Lots of electrical probs starting at approx 80,000mi. Listed in order of failure: check engine light came on 'thermostat', speedometer, fuel gauge and oil pressure gauge at 105,000mi.",2,"Dealer where I purchased the vehicle said none of the probs were covered under warranty because of the mileage. I called Isuzu corporate office and they said there is a ""policy extension"" on the fuel gauge to 120,000mi. The policy extension has a 'campaign number issued for it. "" SB 13-04-S004 (fuel sensor).They referred me to another dealer who has ordered the part for the fuel gauge. However, they say the 'instrument cluster"" needs to be replaced and it is not certain that the fuel gauge will work unless it is replaced and some or all of the probs may or may not work unless the instrument cluster is replaced. 
Footnote: A linkage part in the transmission shifted broke at approx 100,000mi"
isuzu,ascender,2005,Ron, 09/21/2005,My third Isuzu SUV,4,"This is my third Isuzu SUV, I have owned 1996 and 1999 Troopers both bought new. Never had a problem with either. But the 1996 trooper only had 195 horsepower, so I thought it was underpowered.The 1999 had better horsepower at 215. The ascender has 275 horses, which is plenty, but I haven't had it long enough to tell what the fuel econemy is yet, because I have not had it long enough to take any road trips.But I can say, It handles and rides nicely and looks a lot more expensive."
isuzu,ascender,2005,Ascender, 01/12/2006,my car from dad,4,"I actually love this car; its seats are soft, its very roomy inside and it has several power outlets for you to use. I have two cell phones that do need to be charged at times. I think the ride is so smooth and quite and I think its actually bigger then it looks but overall I enjoy this car very much."
isuzu,ascender,2005,Greg Cook, 08/28/2018,Decent transportation at best,3,"Have put only 4300 miles on it in 17 months. One coil pack, thermostat, code P0014 which is camshaft positioning sensor---not replaced, and now transmission shot. Good exterior, tan seats and door panels, black carpet and dash, gray headliner. Frankstein. Daily towing of a 5x8 cargo trailer total about 1400#. Never know trailer back there. Does seem a little harsh with mild bumps. Mileage SUX! Local driving only with mixed using trailer or not...  11.8 MPG

isuzu,ascender,2005,KRYSTAL , 07/25/2005,GOOD VALUE,4,"Our large family was looking for the biggest nicest SUV for the money. My husband was looking at the Highlander and Pilot. The Highlander was too small inside. It was nice but too small and pricey. The Pilot, well the Honda dealership was horrible. All full of lies. The Pilot was a nice SUV but the price was way too much. I talked my husband into looking at the Ascender. At first he was still leaning towards the ighlander until I put them side by side. I won, lol. Its roomy and drives nice. Plus the dealership was great. They gave us a good deal and was willing to drive the Highlander back to the pushy Toyota dealership. This is a nice SUV with a good warranty."
isuzu,ascender,2005,FLAscenderDriver, 08/02/2009,Still love my Ascender after 5 years!,4,"After 5 years and nearly 60K miles, I still love my Ascender.  It looks good, tracks well, doesn't slide around on wet roads, is comfortable, and has plenty of power when needed for towing a trailer or just passing other vehicles.  I love the Bose system stereo and 6 disc changer, the woodgrain dash and steering wheel, leather interior, and especially the dual seat heaters on colder evenings!  It's been a reliable vehicle with only general maintenance/tire upkeep, and had to replace the shocks this Spring.  Well made and comfy, just wish it got better mpg when gas was so pricey."
isuzu,ascender,2005,Edwin Lowe, 01/30/2005,Good Value,4,"We have had it 2 months so the story still remains to be told, but we bought it because of the superior longevity and performance of our former SUV, an Isuzu Trooper.  So far we have been thrilled with the Ascender.  It was more reasonably priced and better warranty than other 7 passenger SUV's we priced."
isuzu,ascender,2005,kent, 02/27/2005,Ascender road trip,5,"Took 3 teenagers and 3 adults to Florida in the new Ascender and it ran great, plenty of room, and very secure in all the bad weather. Also carried cargo on the standard hitch. Got 22 MPG, long cruising range, very comfortable."
isuzu,ascender,2005,Scott, 05/26/2005,good SUV,4,"I'm not a big fan of any SUV basically because they all look the same. Having said that, my 2005 Ascender runs perfectly.  The suspension is just fine; it's one of the few SUVs that have a truck suspension rather than an automobile suspension. Oh and by the way it has the best turning ratio than anything I've ever driven, and I used to have a Chevette."
isuzu,ascender,2005,kent, 06/28/2005,good family room and value,4,"Great comfortable ride and the fuel economy is pretty good, 6 of us and luggage on a trip over 21 mpg, in comfort. Pleased with the value and the 7 year warranty. And got a great price, $24,250 bucks for this 7 passenger and all the features. We enjoy it more than our Chrysler minivan that we never could feel safe about, or always worried when the infamous Chrysler quality and transmission would break down. Pleased with the Ascender."
isuzu,ascender,2005,Rodney, 06/30/2005,I love my Ascender and Saved a Bunch,4,I keep reading the reviews and can't understand why they rate it low.  I love the vehicle.  It has power and steers fine and is great for hauling stuff around.  I really enjoy this vehicle and would really recommend it.  I went from a 2001 Honda Passport (AKA Isuzu Rodeo) and was very comfortable with my purchase.
isuzu,ascender,2005,Bob Ransom, 07/23/2005,Upgrading to the Ascender,4,"I recently upgraded from the Isuzu Rodeo to the Ascender, what an improvement! The overall ride comfort, suspension, brakes, and space were noticeable from the initial test drive. After taking the vehicle on a 600 mile trip, other positives such as the air-conditioner and low level of outside noise became apparent. Purchasing this vehicle has been the best decision I've made all year!"
isuzu,ascender,2005,AzRed, 07/26/2005,comfort,3,Strong engine. Tows trailers well. Front passenger seat is very uncomfortable on trips; my hands fall asleep due to the low hard arm rest. Envoy's seats are much more comfortable.
isuzu,ascender,2005,dogzallez, 04/23/2006,Good Value,4,"While the mileage could be better, the Ascender is a pleasure to drive.  The cabin is roomy and easy to haul things with.  The fold down seats also have headrests that fold down when the seats do so that the head rest doesn't have to be removed from the seats like the older Rodeos did.  Peppy V-6 engine and a smooth ride.  The instruments are easy to see through the steering wheel while driving."
isuzu,ascender,2005,Deb, 07/08/2006,I Love My Isuzu,4,"I previously owned a 96 Rodeo and loved it, but I now adore the luxury and reliability of my Ascender.  I rarely need the 4 wheel drive because it just plows through almost anything!  It is so comfortable with the electric driver seat, audio system, great ride, quiet and enjoyable, roomy - definitely a step up in luxury from my Rodeo. Cargo space easy to get to, back lift gate easy to use, exterior handsome and easy care. Gas mileage same as Rodeo. I hope it is as reliable as my Rodeo was. It had no problems and body was excellent shape after 10 years.  Hope GMC put same quality into the Ascender.  I DO LOVE THIS VEHICLE AND WOULD PURCHASE ANOTHER!"
isuzu,ascender,2005,mlnkthr, 11/07/2004,It's a nice sporty off roader,5,"Loads of power underneath the bonnet, plus its ever so sporty with a V8. "
isuzu,ascender,2005,Sabryna, 12/30/2004,My view on 2005 Ascender,3,I feel that overall the suv was a very good price. However I feel that the tires that they have on the Suv really STINK! They don't handle well on wet/snow pavement. If they put a better tires on it then the preformance rating I would give would have been much hire.
isuzu,ascender,2005,Gloria Scott, 01/23/2005,We like it!,4,"As this is a larger SUV than the one we traded (Mazda Tribute), we didn't that the ride would be quite so smooooth!  Nice!  Just hope the vehicle suits us as much as we like the handling - thus far."
isuzu,ascender,2005,Bronco84, 02/18/2005,Best choice,4,"In first 30 days drove over 4000 miles in rain, ice, sleet and snow. The vehicle performed beyond my expectations. Traction was great with total control. Only problem encountered was widnshield washer fluid freeze up with factory fluid at  -30 degrees temperature. Engine performed great in mountains as well as on flatlands."
isuzu,ascender,2005,jackie, 04/21/2005,Great vehicle,4,"I did plenty of research and drove about every other van and SUV that was a 7 seater. The Ascender is really a great vehicle. It is very roomy in all rows. It is versatile with folding seats. Storage is better than any other SUV I tried. I have every option on mine and it is really nice and very enjoyable to drive. I had a minivan for 16 years and really am pleased with this change. I still have room for 7 people but it is a whole lot more fun to drive. The gas mileage is not great, but it is not much different than my older van. I get about 16 in the city and I got 19 on my first long trip. I highly recommend this vehicle."

isuzu,ascender,2005,sanabu, 06/07/2005,Best deal in the large SUV market!,4,"I just picked up my 2005 Isuzu Ascender Limited. It is a real joy to drive. It is a very smooth drive and highly comfortable when you have a family of four. The best part of this giant SUV is the price. It is GMC made. It is actually the GMC Envoy minus 8,000 dollars. It is very pretty car. I get a lot compliments on its looks."
isuzu,ascender,2005,Lancer95, 07/05/2005,My Isuzu Ascender LS Review,4,"I like Isuzu Ascender which is the same as the Trailblazer and Envoy, but I think that the Ascender is a lot better looking in design and has a better price and warranty."
isuzu,ascender,2005,Kent, 12/02/2005,Comfortable limo type ride,4,"Great ride, good performance and comfortable for 6 of us on a 1500 mile trip to South Florida. Gas mileage of 21 was great and on regular gas. The AWD was great in the rain, and using the trailer hitch and wiring was easy. Good heater and A/C system. Price of $24,000 was lower than some minivans we looked at and this has all wheel drive. Much tighter vehicle than the Town and Country, and more versatile than the van."

isuzu,ascender,2005,Ron, 07/18/2007,Good Value,4,"Good value for the money, no problems after two years, good smooth car like ride with plenty of power."
isuzu,ascender,2006,great deal by Jeff, 06/28/2006,Drive it before you buy it,4,"Large suv, plenty of room for all sized people and cargo. Has plenty of power with 6 cylinder; if you are looking for a large suv check it out but drive it before you buy it. It is large, but you can get a good deal on pricing.  Get the preferred package which adds to its good looks and you get lots of extra goodies."
isuzu,ascender,2006,John, 09/20/2007,Bargain for a solid SUV,4,"A solidly built SUV at a great price is good choice for anyone who wants a basic utility vehicle.  The engine is great, with lots of power and good gas mileage.  Speaking of gas mileage, remember, if you live in a cold climate and have a lead foot, every SUV will eat gas, but GM's powerful engine lets you use a light foot and still get sufficient power. I average 19 mpg in everyday driving, 21 on the highway as long as you keep it below 80. That's probably as good as real-world results for most crossovers.  So if what you want is a car that has more room, get a crossover.  If you like to haul, tow and drive on dirt, these GMs are good choices, and the Isuzu has the best warranty (pre 2007)."
isuzu,ascender,2006,Pete, 07/08/2006,Save Your Money Buy A Dodge!,1,"I was told this is the top of it's class. It had a high towing capacity. I needed something to tow my boat and that would be good on gas. I've owned this SUV for almost 5 months and I had to go back to the dealer 6 or 7 time to fix it. I should of done more research on this SUV. I went to the dealer after the second visit in the first week of owning the SUV and talked to the man and told him if I could have my older car back and he could keep the $3500 I gave them, well I guess you no how that turned out. The Isuzu is a Chevy. I called Isuzu and told them all the problems that I'm having; the man that should help me said ""I'm sorry sir, but I pull my boat with a Dodge."" Now that was funny to me."
isuzu,ascender,2006,scott kelso, 11/02/2006,"poor quality, not worth the money!",2,"I have only had my Ascender for 4 months now and I have been back to the dealership 6 times. Driving lamps 3 times, rear seatbelt 3 times, transmission 4 times and body molding 2 times. Transmission shifts hard on long trips. Driving lights keep fogging up. The front bumper moves up and down while driving. Center console wiggles by just putting your arm on it."
isuzu,ascender,2006,Luv2Go, 07/28/2006,Jimmy goes Isuzu,3,"I enjoy the Isuzu Ascender, it's a nicely designed vehicle which has a great turning radius for an SUV. The driving performance is smooth and acceleration transitions nicely.  Its competitor, the Envoy, has better standard features and doesn't skimp on basic items as a resume button for cruise control.  The Ascender is great for a small family of 4 taking a trip. Rear cargo is adequate for big suitcases."
isuzu,ascender,2006,OHIO BOY, 07/18/2009,Real SUV no crossover!,4,If you want a real SUV this a great car. The mileage is not great but it is a big SUV . Brakes are a problem on this SUV . The heat builds up and takes out the rotors. Put the better rotors on it.
isuzu,ascender,2006,wokeup, 11/20/2009,High Maintenance,2,"Great looking and a great ride, but very poor mpg on highway 15.  Also, at 70,000 mi it fell apart, new water pump, new alternator, stabler track problems, fuel gauge problems, window on passengers side leaks and exhaust leak. Not to mention normal maintenance of breaks and belts. Low initial price, but they make up for it later down the road on repair costs."
isuzu,ascender,2006,para333am, 12/07/2012,Nightmare,2,"We purchased our 2006 Ascender brand new. Granted the body is great. I was hit by a large work van which in a car would of sent me to the hospital, the truck held up well. The engine is a nightmare. We just paid it off and it has less than 115,000 miles on it but the engine has died completely. I am very upset since it was purchased new and well taken care of.. I will never buy another one again.. I will only purchase Honda or Toyota from now on. "
isuzu,ascender,2006,dapperD, 07/03/2006,Best Kept Secret,4,"I have only had this Ascender for a short while but fell in love with it the moment I took it on a test drive.  It has a very soft ride for city driving.  Highway driving while smooth is a bit choppy.  I think it has to do with aerodynamics and that I'm used to owning a car.  Compared to the Ascender's cousins (Trailblazer, Envoy), it can't be beat for warranty and price.  I bought mine brand new for $19,965.  Apparently, Isuzu was offering quite a bit off of MSRP yet it wasn't advertised.  This is almost $7,000 off of sticker price (I think it's because Isuzu is in big trouble financially).  How was I going to pass that up?  This SUV is a beauty and you won't see many on the road.  "

isuzu,ascender,2006,Alex, 03/20/2006,Worth The Price Spent For It,5,"This SUV is great. I love the way it handles, almost like a sports car. Strong yet responsive. To know I have a 4.2 really feels like security. I recommend it to all who do not have a big family; recommend it if you've never had an SUV. Try it and you might buy."
isuzu,ascender,2006,scuba1600, 06/08/2006,love it,4,"Love it so far, but it is new.  I'm coming from a Mitsubishi Outlander, so anything probably would be luxury and wonderful to drive compared to the Outlander.  Hopefully I get many, many good, comfortable miles from my Ascender.  I like the power, soft ride that it gives.  Just wish the base model came with cruise control and floor mats, and not having keyless entry in the base model is ridiculous."

isuzu,ascender,2006,Rebecca, 08/25/2007,My Truck,5,"I love this truck. I drove from Virginia to California and it was the most comfortable ride I have ever had. Even with towing a U-haul trailer this truck had no problems going up the mountain and was so easy to handle. I am a person who trades vehicles in every 2 years, I believe I will have this truck for a lot longer."
isuzu,ascender,2007,AYGARCIA, 06/24/2010,Good SUV,4,"I like my ASCENDER 2007, but don't like the front seat belts.  They scratch my neck and I have to keep pulling them away for a while.  The seat belts are too low.  Also, the tire maintenance sensor lights went on the first week I bought it and they've been on for 3 years, even though the tires are brand new, including the spare tire!  I wish it had keyless entry and better sound system.  The center console is too fragile.  Other than that, it is a good car to drive."
isuzu,ascender,2007,Heidarella, 12/11/2007,Our First Isuzu SUV,4,"Being used to a big Dodge I was skeptical to purchase a smaller vehicle. Surprisingly the interior feels roomy with pretty good leg room. Fits my family and animals well. Handles wonderful in the snow and the ride is quite comfortable. I travel to CT a lot and this SUV is more than satisfactory in comfort for the long trips. I love the turning radius when parking especially in Boston. The engine has pretty good zip as I waited for a ""Lag"" when going up hills, but that never happened. The pick up was right on and the full frame gives the feeling of sturdiness. With all the outside recreational activities this SUV has supported us well!"
isuzu,ascender,2007,desertdog, 07/25/2010,Love My Ascender,4,"We have had our ascender more than 2 years so far, and we love it. It has a great smooth ride, and is pretty much a rebadged trail blazer. The car literally is labeled GM everywhere except on the hood, and the steering wheel. "
isuzu,ascender,2007,Tom, 07/01/2008,Losing Some Paint,3,"After almost a year of ownership, overall I really like the vehicle.  It handles the snow well and the ride is very good for an SUV.  There is a problem of the paint getting blasted off on the flairs in front of the rear wheels."

isuzu,ascender,2007,Aloha, 02/21/2020,Solid SUV,5,"I love my 2007 Isuzu Ascender. It has a very strong solid vortex engine like my Chevy Astro van. Cheap parts and easy to fix. I live on a hillside property and drives it everyday without any problem. Floor the accelerator and this car flies smoothly and dust everybody on the freeway without feeling any vibration. Clean your carburetor every 3 mos and it runs like new again. They did a very good paint job on this car. Never did polish since I bought it but it’s always has that new shine. They use some type of special aero dynamic paint material.

isuzu,ascender,2008,donna steele, 01/13/2009,Not a beer can,4,"Just totaled an Equinox which folded up like a beer can at less than 30 mph with both air bags deploying even though I was alone in the car. The Ascender has a heavy frame, my husband crawled under it to check it out. It is quiet, very comfortable and has all the bells and whistles I love,as a spoiled woman including heated leather dual 6 way power seats and moon roof. My gas mileage so far has exceeded my expectations at 17 around town. I'm very pleased with my ""new"" used car ( it had 4800 miles on it)and the price I paid for it. I also feel safer with automatic on/off front air bags and side air bags. "
isuzu,axiom,2002,Bill McKinney, 06/23/2007,My 2002 Axiom,4,"Car has been very reliable and is eye-catching in appearance.   I still get people asking me, even after 5 years old and 3 years since last Axiom was made, what kind of car it is and where can they look at a new one.   The styling obviously made it impossible to put in a third row seat but have to say that I have never needed to carry more than 5 people and sometimes go for months with the rear seats folded down.   It's been a great car and although I plan on my next purchase being a sedan, I will keep the Axiom."
isuzu,axiom,2002,BISBISS, 06/23/2006,Safety,4,I was rear-ended; I was at a stand still and was hit from behind at about 70 miles per hour. My Axiom was thrown into the guardrail at a great rate of impact. I walked away. There is nothing left of my SUV except an untouched driver and passenger seat. Way to go on safety. The fireman told me he had seen three Axioms involved in bad accidents like mine and the drivers all lived.
isuzu,axiom,2002,texasheart, 05/03/2011,Fan of Isuzu,5,"I bought my '02 Axiom used in '05 with 12K miles on it.
She now has 110K miles and is still going strong.
She looks cool, is a great road trip car because she's so comfortable and has been completely reliable.
I don't take exceptional care of my vehicles, but she keeps on going without any complaints or major issues.
I'm the type of person who trades up every 3 years, but I've had this car for 5 and intend to keep her for a long time.


My first Isuzu was an Amigo and I'd still have it if I didn't let it run out of oil.
Oops.
My Axiom was the replacement."
isuzu,axiom,2002,bill, 08/30/2005,fun to drive,3,"Great power and good handling. Very reliable except that tranny out at 48,000 but is being replaced under warranty. Good amount of storage in back. Heavy sturdy feel but overall mpg suffers from weight and averages about 15. Blows around a bit in the wind."
isuzu,axiom,2002,Jon, 01/07/2005,TOD PROBLEMS ARE EXPENSIVE,2,"I purchased my Axiom on 11/26/2001. At the time I was attracted by the zero percent financing and nice look of the body style. The vehicle drinks gas like an elephant. 12.2 mpg city and 18 mpg highway. This is terrible for a six cylinder. The tires are Goodyears and are terrible. They do not corner well and are terrible on the highway. If you are foolish enough to buy this vehicle do yourself a favor and change the tires right away. The sensors for the TOD are expensive and mine went after 37 months. I still owe $9,000.00 on the vehicle and already I'm putting big money into it. It only has 30,000 miles on it. I do not recommend this vehicle to anyone."
isuzu,axiom,2002,Bill, 08/23/2007,Best buy,4,"A good vehicle with a bad rep.  I dont know why people are ripping on the transmission, which is the same exact transmission that was in the Trooper from 90 to 02 and is also in many GM vehicles.  Great engine and serious acceleration. Never left me stranded. Only typical wear and tear in the 5 years I've had it.  Won't sell it because its resale is lower than its actual value."
isuzu,axiom,2002,Margaret Caley, 10/11/2016,Love my Isuzu.,5,"This is the most luxurious car I've ever owned.  The two-toned leather seats are beautiful and comfortable.  There is more storage space than any similar car.  I have hauled furniture, groceries, fabric and friends.  People are always surprised when I tell them how old it is.  Isuzu has been a good brand, my 1993 Rodeo is still going strong.  Now my daughter is driving the Axiom and we gave the Rodeo to a friend.  I would have bought another Isuzu if they were sold in the U.S..
"
isuzu,axiom,2002,brantm21, 01/12/2011,Mixed Emotions....,3,"Had this car for a family vehicle. It was reliable, yes. And it was comfortable, yes. It's hard to put into words but it was just awkward to drive. I did like the ability to stiffen the suspension but it still handled horribly. I loved the interior personally. The sunroof was a nice touch. Never had a problem with it mechanically. Drove it probably 15k Highway miles all over this beautiful USA country."
isuzu,axiom,2002,bmprigge, 03/30/2010,Beware!,3,"I've had this car for a little over two years and it is in the shop again for a blown engine.  The last time, it had an issue with the engine and it completely seized, this time a rod shot through the block.  It's a pain having to have it in the shop so often (I had to get a new transmission in it about 6 months ago) but I can't bring myself to trade it in because I LOVE DRIVING IT!! I would say that if you can find one, buy it (but make sure you get an extended warranty).  "
isuzu,axiom,2002,Trish, 04/04/2010,had my axiom for 5 years,3,"One thing that I loved about the axiom was the outside design.  But don't let that fool you.  I have had nothing but troubles with this SUV from the transmission, to the electrical, and the list continues.  I am very disappointed in Isuzu and will never by one again.  Plus on top of all the problems the parts are hard to find and real expensive. To make matter worst this car bounces like crazy no matter what I've done. Buyer beware!"
isuzu,axiom,2002,drivzgrlzcrz, 03/15/2009,Woah,4,"I will start off by saying I am very picky about my ride, and I love this vehicle it caught my eye at first but to be fair I looked around the lot only to return to it and peek inside, this is when I turned into a kid. Sweet interior, I knew 2 minutes into my test drive I was hooked. This SUV is unique and I get loads of compliments, I was previously interested in the Scion lineup & the Element but this is so me. The engine sounds like a tuned up car in power drive, super fun. Yes the pass doors could open more, the ride is wobbly in comfort, & the steering around turns uses more muscle but try to find an SUV that is perfect.. There isn't one, but this is very close. "
isuzu,axiom,2002,Luc, 10/18/2008,Best SUV you will ever own!,4,"4 years and the only repair was a tuning light bulb! Replace the factory Good Years and the ride quality will improve. I got a set of Pirelli Scorpion ATR - 80 miles/hour and you can hear only a little wind noise! Gas mileage is average, but OK for an SUV - I will say better than most SUVs with same engine size. If you are looking for a used SUV, this will beat by far any other used SUV available in value/reliability/price!"
isuzu,axiom,2002,Frankie, 02/08/2009,7 years and still going strong,4,"Bought it new 8/02. Seven years, 60k miles now. Regular maintenance service (oil changes,air filter). Replaced the s-belt myself @ 45k miles. No other service. New BF Goodrich tires @ 50k miles.On the way to tire dealer, just to see what power this 6cyl had I held the brake, put the pedal to the floor, slowly released the brake and smoked the tires for 200 ft. Avg 18.1 mpg since day one. Haven't reset since I bought it. Too bad Isuzu pulled out of US. I definitely would have bought another by now. Traded in a '97 Rodeo (bought new, had 137000 miles on it in 5 years, zero repairs) for this one."
isuzu,axiom,2002,Oh Axiom Driver, 10/13/2009,Ohio Axiom Driver,3,"Overall I've been happy with my Ax.  The ride is bouncy, and I had to replace my factory tires after 20k mile because I almost flipped it on an exit ramp.  I put Pirelli's on it and wow, what difference.  I've also had in the shop for transmission problems a couple times...oh and now that I've passed 100k in miles, I burn a quart of oil a week.  This is known problem with the vehicle, but no one knows what to do about it."

isuzu,axiom,2002,Seth Johnson, 03/26/2019,Great car for the $$,4,"I first bought a Axion because I had no other choice, I was broke, just lost my job and needed a car now! I bought a 2002 4wd axiom, it had dents, and the frame was rusted very severally. The tranny was not shifting right, but it ran well. I had many good compliments from people and i grew to love the thing. Finally after a few months the tranny finally went out, but by this time I was in better financial situation and actually bought a rodeo that ran great. And a few months later I bought another Axiom, it was a 2wd xs with 98k. Was spotless, but... the wonderful gm 4l30e transmission that all isuzus have in this era went out just one week after my purchase, it was difficult,  but I found a used trans from a 02 trooper that would fit, with low mileage. I really like this car, handles great, runs strong, looks good, feels sturdy and well built. For the $$ I have into it I feel that it is a great value.

drive, however there is not enough room 
for a rear-facing car seat in the 
back.  The back doors do not open wide 
enough to easily put in a car seat with 
a baby latched in, and when the carseat 
is in, the front 2 seats have to be 
adjusted all the way forward, which

isuzu,axiom,2002,russ carroll, 03/04/2002,Axiom - Best SUV buy for the money!,4,"After testing almost all of the mid size SUV's, the AXIOM was, by far, the best overall value for the money. ISUZU offered 0% financing or $4500 off MSRP making it cost around $23,500 with a moonroof, leather, 6 CD changer, Power everything, full size spare, and a very attractive interior black and tan trim. The 10 year/120,000 powertrain warranty was the icing on the cake for this SUV shopper. I highly recommend test driving the AXIOM and it should fit most empty nester's needs."
isuzu,axiom,2002,gretchensanchez, 08/20/2003,2002 Isuzu Axiom,3,"In my experience having owned and used 
the vehicle for two years now, I have 
found the following.  The interior 
color selections of camel/black 
interior is too light shows dirt and 
wear quickly.  The backseat cargo 
conversion is cumbersome. You have to 
move the front seats forwards, remove 
backseat headrests, pull lower portion 
of seat forward and then back seat 
will fold down.  In addition I have 
found that the exterior is extremely 
easy to ding scratch/dent. We have 
also experienced a number of problems 
with the braking system."

-Decent power and brakes.
-TOD is a great feature for everyone.

-Trailer towing no problem.
-Smooth shifting.

Cons:

-Low interior headroom takes getting 
used to.
-Rear access is tough for adults, ok 
for adult short rides once your seated.
-Need a hard hat for the lift gate 
becuase it does not raise high enough.
-Auto lock feature not available.
-You must remove the rear seat 
headrest to fold the cargo area flat,

-Average higway mileage is 17-

factor in this purchase."

it off roading and it performs great. A 
great feature are the skid plates that 
are standard on the vehicle. It's 
elegant for going out and yet it's 
rugged enough to stand up in the woods. 
Living in New England I was impressed 
the way it handled in snow as well. 
I've never had a problem with it and 
I've gotten 17,000 miles on it so far. 
My wife loves driving it and she feels

isuzu,axiom,2002,Tbone, 04/19/2002,INITIALLY HAD BUYER REMORSE,4,"This is my first SUV and it rides like 
a car.  I didn't get the four wheel

efficieny. I am averaging around 19.5 
(it was worse until I hit the 10,000 
mileage). I get many compliments on the 
vehicle (the color is anthracite 
metllatic).  At first I was saddened 
cause I didn't get the four wheel 
drive, which would have the Tourqe on 
Demand.  In the Maryland area, we have 
been having mild winters. This past 
winter there would have been only two 
instances to use the four wheel drive, 
so now I am okay. Overall, I am quite

disappointed in the MPG."
isuzu,axiom,2002,RDL, 04/24/2002,New Axiom Owner,5,"I've owned this vehicle for about a month now, and I am very pleased with it.
It handles very well.  I drive on mountain roads with switchbacks and the 
handling for this type of vehicle is fantastic.  The acceleration is great, and I 
like the Pwer Drive mode for passing uphill. The gas mileage has also been 
very good, averaging 18.5 MPG.
I think one of the best things about the Axiom is the comfort of the cabin.  I 
have the leather package and the seats are very comfortable with all the 
controls within easy reach."

to say I am sick of reading how awsome 
it handles, like a car.  This toaster, 
that was wrongly named ""Axiom"" blows 
all over the road with the slightest 
gust.  It does pull my boat, witch is 
nice.  Too bad my boat is easier to 
drive in a straight line. If you don't

backfires.  maybe I got a dud who

manufacturer."

different.  The roof rack installed

year ago and stolen.  The gray leather 
with black exterior is a big 
improvement.  Engine performs well.  
Fuel mileage is only ok though.  
Considering the deals available.  The 
Axiom is a great value for the money.

lucky exclusive folks to own one) but 
for power, looks, durability, etc. this 
is one potent pony.  I got the base 
model with some options since the 
vehicle comes so well equipped anyway.  
The longer I drive this truck, the more 
pleased I am with my purchase.  Am 
approaching the 6k mark and it has been 
extremely pleasant.   This is one 
outstanding vehicle and if you were to 
compare Isuzu's warranty to many

another 2-3k."

isuzu,axiom,2002,KingMikey, 06/19/2009,You could do much worse,4,"Honestly, I had this car for 7 years and 105K before my wife totaled it last week and with the exception of an AC compressor a year or two ago, the vehicle was flawless. I towed a 3500lb boat and it was perfect. Even with the 2WD model the limited slip system never got me stuck at a boat ramp or anywhere else. And it always had plenty of power to tow that boat. Fuel efficiency was always a problem whether towing or not though."
isuzu,axiom,2002,MA Axiom Driver, 07/01/2009,Model prone to Frame Rust-through,3,02 Axiom with 85K miles. We live in central MA and driven by my wife who babies the car.  Rear Trailing Arm/Stabilizer completely rusted off the frame. Completely unacceptable on today's car. Same frame as Rodeo and Honda Passport.  Do NOT BUY this car until you physically check for frame rust and specifically on the rear trailing arms.

isuzu,axiom,2002,srad, 06/18/2002,Don't let the Reviews fool you!,4,"I have only owned this vehicle a few
weeks but have managed to take it down
curved roads, dirt and graveled roads,
highway, rain, etc.  This is a great
vehicle.  Most reviews I have read
didn't like the gas mileage-Compared to
what?  Most suv's get less than 20
anyway- A wife, 2 kids, 2 dogs fits just
fine. I have drove Passat wagons,
4-Runners, Pathfinders, and full size
chevy-ford trucks and this is a very
reasonable compromise. I never had any
major problems with Isuzu-I really
recommend this vehicle if you can get it
under($22,000). It just has a bad
name... it is not a bad vehicle."
isuzu,axiom,2002,BlackAx, 06/18/2002,The most underrated SUV out there!!!,4,"Bought an Axiom 4wd base model a month 
ago. This truck is a blast to drive. 
The driving positon is great, plenty 
of room. It came stock with all of the 
features you'd find in more expensive 
trucks. The fit and finish are 
excellent. It has all of the room of 
some of the larger, more expensive 
SUV's out there. It's guarenteed to 
turn heads at every stoplight! They're 
not selling well so you can really get 
a great deal now. Remember, this is a 
truck not a jacked up car."

excellent ride and great power.230

Well worth the money.  Only improvement 
I can think of is the radio, can't 
upgrade it.  A/C control is mixed in 
with the radio"
isuzu,axiom,2002,elite_iv, 07/24/2002,Only One!!,5,"This SUV is nothing short of amazing.
The alternate transmission and
suspensions options make it so much fun
to drive.  You can feel like your
driving an X5 or a Landcruiser.  I have
driven both and neither have anything on
the Axiom.  I have the two-tone leather
seats which are extremely stylish and
comfortable.  I put about 16,000 miles
on her so far without any problems.  My
average gas mileage is 18MPG, which is
great for an SUV. I get 20MPG on trips.
 It is quiet, smooth, and, yet,
powerful.  The looks are unbelievable
and the drive is luxurious.      Get one
as soon as you can.  I have had it 6
months and have only seen 1 other one.
Another unexpected perk."

styling is one the major reasons I 
chose it (I like being different).  
It's a great value compared to other 
SUVs (blows away Jeep and Pathfinder).  
The ride is tough, so make no mistake 
you are definitely buying a TRUCK, it 
just happens to look more car-like, 
with very car-like amenities.  The 
interior is a bit cheap and plastiky 
for a $30k MSRP.  I'm a bit worried now 
about the resale value.  But this truck 
has a lot going for it, and in 10,000

few minor squeaks and rattles."

The only trouble I had was getting the 
license plate on the front. Will no

Switch over to the TOD - this an excellent vehicle for wet conditions and fast take offs at stops.  Push button HP boost allows more push for uphills and passing.  After 35k miles my only problem with my Axiom is that - going 55 on a flat road - you will only get 22 mpg at best.  In the city 11-17.  This engine is inefficient.  My GMC 1/2 ton Denali gets as good of gas mileage as this much smaller V6.  All in all - this ride has got a stylish look, plenty of power for driving around town, moderate interior room, and multiple suspension modes for fun travel. It will keep you looking for cheaper gas."

isuzu,axiom,2002,Pitt, 08/31/2005,Good so far,4,"I bought the Axiom pre-owned and at 73,000+ miles it seems to be a good buy as SUVs go. I haven't had any complaints that the factory could have addressed with the exception of the sound system. Getting the base model I didn't expect much but the speakers are pretty dull. I have read reviews about the tires as well and mine looked to be a fresh set, but they do squeal with most maneuvering action that didn't get the squeal from my last car."
isuzu,axiom,2002,Shakey077, 01/26/2004,GREAT SUV,4,"I have had my Axiom for 1 year now and 
have logged 12k miles. It has been 
flawless. Very fun to drive, plenty of 
power. Gas mileage could be a bit 
better but it is an SUV. The stock 
tires however are not so good, they 
squeel on any turn at ant speed and 
slip in the rain. The only other 
complaint would be driver leg room, I 
am 6' tall and it is just a tad tight."

they also put roof rack on free"
isuzu,axiom,2002,rcasti01, 02/18/2004,Think Twice,3,"I bought the vehicle because of the 
distinct design, leather color interior 
and quality.  But after just 1 year of 
driving this particular vehicle it has 
been in the shop 4 times.  Twice 
becuase of electrical problems and 
twice for interior pieces falling 
apart.  In-fact on the driver door 
panel the bottom paneling is coming 
off, so I'll have to return it back to 
the dealership. The MSRP was a little 
under 30K, with a 4K dealer discount 
plus my GM discount... I bought on

to it."
isuzu,axiom,2002,tom mcgrath, 06/16/2006,Axiom driving,3,"The vehicle has been quite good and not required other than normal maintenance.  Got it to tow my boat and it is quite adequate.  Need to replace rear wiper arm and it is a very non standard design, though the front arms are standard.  Can't buy it anywhere.  Top heavy like all SUV/4wd and need to be aware of that.  Gas mileage is poor - average 19.5 under the best of conditions, much worse with a load."

other too soft. Many positive comments 
about the interior and especially the 
exterior. Somehow, paper litter seems 
to find its way from the glove

Probably bad design.  "
isuzu,axiom,2002,Napertucktim, 05/11/2004,Don't be fooled,1,"The Isuzu warranty isnt worth the 
paper its written on. 3/50 doesnt 
cover major brake components (not 
talking about pads) along with many 
other parts and 10/120 appears to be a 
joke. Dealership lied about warranty 
and build quality is sub-par at best. 
Isuzu customer service is horrible and 
will not stand behind their product and 
will blame dealer for problems. Buy a 
Subaru or spend a little more to get a 
quality vehicle because low price 
reflects poor quality and reliability 
at Isuzu."

am really enjoying this Isuzu.  "

loaded to max.  Torque on Demand 4

fooled by the styling and hype. It has 
been ti the dealer 6 times. The leather

Now two years later it has happened three times.  The rear shocks are now being replaced, the fog lights have blown two times,  the brake lights have gone out once, there has been a rattling noise in the engine for about six months, and now the display screen has started to black out. Not to mention the fact that the car depreciated over 50% within the 1st year of ownership which has forced me to keep it even though it always seems to be in the shop. Think TWICE before you buy this one! "

looking at getting another but I 
wanted to buy not lease. I had spent 
about 2 months shopping around and 
comparing other SUV's and for the 
money, ride and equipment nothing came 
close to the Axiom. The SUV's that 
came close to what I was looking for 
were the new Nissan Murano and GMC 
Envoy but costing between 3,000 and 
5,000 dollars more for a similarly

Since the Axiom replaced my Camry, I 
look at it and use it like a car.  We 
have a pickup for most hauling.  As a 
car, its the best I've ever driven.  
Spacious, smooth, and quietier than

30,000 mile check-up.  The vehicle has 
been flawless.  In 30,00 miles, I've 
had one driving light go, and that's 
t.  I use Mobil 1 synthetic every 5,000 
miles.  The truck pulls my 23 foot boat 
with no problems.  I would say my only 
complaint is the ride stinks on bumpy 
roads.  It is great for highway diving, 
and handles way better than the other 
SUV's I tested. Overall, I'm very happy 
with my decision.  If you told me 3 
ears ago, I would be driving an Isuzu, 
I probably would have laughed out 
loud.  I was wrong.  It's been a very 
good experience."

a full 2 months. I went to all other

test drove the BMW, MERCEDES, LEXUS and 
ACURA. I just could not justify any of 
them with this vehicle. I mean, this 
SUV outperforms all of those namebrands 
by FAR. The warranty the comfort the 
reliability the pricing, oh my GOD, 
this is an amzing vehicle. I would 
recommend anyone out there to go and 
BUY THIS b4 it is too late. Isuzu has 
special 0% financing going on, you must 
TEST DRIVE THIS VEHICLE, and then just 
step on the gas, it overtakes just 
about any other mid-sized SUV's. In 
just under 8.9 seconds, it goes from 0 
to 60 MPH."
isuzu,axiom,2002,Shawn Dearing, 01/18/2003,WOW This is an suv.,4,"I bought this SUV and love it.  The 
acceleration is very spirited.  The 
handling is very responsive.  Do not 
believe the bad reviews this SUV has 
gotten.  I have seen a few on the road 
and I tought it looks very sporty for 
an SUV.  You can tell that they have 
limited the marketing because you are 
not paying for that in the sticker.  My 
MSRP was 31,505 and I paid a cool 
24,500 after the nice 4K rebate.

isuzu,axiom,2002,MidwesternBill, 02/07/2003,Power and Handling are Great,4,"Lots of power and great handling. 
Outperforms the other small/midsize 
suv's I drove. You'll like this if you 
want more of a rugged truck feel, yet 
the handling and cornering are tight. 
Very stable on turns. Doesn't feel like 
a sedan. If you want  that buy a Buick 
Rendevous (poor handling and a dog). A 
tip if you think the styling is a bit 
unusual: add a 
roof rack, rear spoiler (wing) and 
running boards. Looks awesome. Surf the 
web for the rear wing. Mine is all 
black--looks great with the chrome 
trim! Next thing I might add are chrome 
wheels--wow! "

making you think it's not that good). 
It runs great (next year, supposed to 
get a 250hp Direct Injection V6 and a 
Diesel V6, too) but the shocks seem a 
bit overkill. Got some shocks from my 
mates in Australia (Old Man Emu- 
strange name/ tough, great shocks) to 
replace the electronic ones which would 
have been expensive to replace one-for-
one when they wore out; just cut to the

better, just don't have ""choices""; net

whole life.  Nobody has had exactly 
what I wanted until now.  The Axiom is 
the right size for a family vehicle.  
It's big enough to carry vacation gear 
cross country, but still small enough 
not to feel like a boat around town.  
With sports car styling and 
performance you leave the ""soccer-dad 
look"" in your dust.  It comes well 
equiped as a base model, missing only 
the leather seats and foglights.  The 
Axiom's ride is great for this 
catagory of vehicle.  I had planned on 
a Toyota Highlander as my next car but 
after comparing them I really 
preferred the Axiom."

With doing mostly city driving, the in dash mileage gauge show's we've averaged 19.8 mpg since we've bought, though it seems we get more.

in stop and go traffic or do lots of city driving. 
This means a fill up every 225 miles with the 
small 16.9 gallon tank (go further if you like

I thought it was something I was doing. Every time I begin to accelerate my truck would jerk like it didn't want to go. I took it back to the dealership and of course it didn't do the jerk while they drove it. I took it to the service dept. where they supposedly did a transmission flush and it stopped the slipping for awhile. It's back now. I am so frustrated with this vehicle. I'm on the verge of taking it back.

It had 113,XXX miles on it and I fell in love with it. 5 minutes after paying for it, it died going down the highway! We baought a brand new transmission and had it put it, and have taken back atleast once a month because it keeps sliping. Then the fuel pump went out, and the day the fuel pump was fixed, the transmission went out again. After owning it for 7 months, we have put more money into keeping it running than what we paid for it in the first place. I LOVE this car, (WHEN IT RUNS!!) but after sinking every penny we had and after being stranded on the road multiple times with my children, we are just taking a loss and selling for anything we can get."

isuzu,axiom,2003,self-evident truth, 09/08/2003,We're thrilled!,4,"We love our Axiom!  This is our 15th new 
auto purchase, and by far our best vehicle 
yet!  In our first few months of ownership, we 
took several 2K road trips, and everybody is 
happy (including kid and dog).  Love the 
way it handles, and its got mega power 
(which is a welcome relief from our V6 
Toyota Forerunner, which lacked as much 
space, as it did power)!  Love the leather, 
and the 6CD shuttle system, and everytime 
we walk out to our baby, we can't help but 
marvel at her beauty!!!"
isuzu,axiom,2003,beeves, 01/10/2004,"Nice ride, easy to park and fun",4,"We'd never heard of Axiom. We only 
test drove Honda Pilot and Element, 
Lexus RX 330, Nissan Pathfinder and 
Mercury Mountaineer. Once we test 
drove the Axiom, we were amazed with 
its drive quality. It was easy to park 
even in the tightest space at work. 

I personally think it's comparable to 
a Honda Pilot in terms of drive 
comfort and ride quality. "
isuzu,axiom,2003,AxiBaby, 02/09/2003,The Classiest SUV Ever!,5,"I have test driven alot of SUV's and 
more than half of them I Didn't like. I 
finally had decided that I wanted a 
Nissan Murano until I saw a Axiom drive 
by (I was at a autoplex with different 
dealerships).  I drove over to the 
Isuzu dealership and fell in love with 
it! I bought a 2002 Anthracite Axiom 
with a moonroof and rear spoiler right 
on the spot. Heads turn where ever I 
drive because you don't see many on the 
road. I've gotten tons of compliments 
and even better my mother test drove 
mine,went out and purchased one exactly 
like mine (except hers is a XS model)! 
Do not pass this SUV up!! It's the best 
one in my opinion on the road."
isuzu,axiom,2003,uofpittpanthers, 02/16/2003,2002 Isuzu Axiom,4,"Very happy with vehicle...actually 
over 23 mpg highway mileage with reg. 
gas,,,,compare to dollar for dollar 
against highlander or other comparable 
mid size and you won't think twice 
about buying this vehicle."
isuzu,axiom,2003,Cosmo, 07/14/2003,You get what you pay for - in a good way,4,"True, the storage space is limited and 
the ride is not as smooth as the 
Highlander or Endeavor, but the price 
is much lower, too.  My Axiom seems 
well made, is really fun to drive and I 
got the XS 4x4 fully loaded (minus the 
trailer hitch) for under $26K."
isuzu,axiom,2003,jennkrimm, 06/11/2003,axiom,4,"i love this vehichle and i would tell 
anyone who wants an suv that this would 
be a great purchase"
isuzu,axiom,2003,mandi, 07/29/2003,Isuzu Axiom,3,"I began leasing my 2002 Isuzu Axiom 
8/01.  At that time there was not much 
info on the vehicle.  I am satisfied 
with appearance of the car, and the 
interior is comfortable, however there 
have been some problems which will 
prevent me from continuing to drive it 
when my lease is up.  I believe the 
price is a bit high for what you get.  
There is a lot of rattling and noise 
coming from the dash.  Also, there is 
some paint discoloration.  The engine 
will also become very loud when the air 
conditioning is used. The ride can also 
be very bumpy. I will shop around a bit 
more next time."
isuzu,axiom,2003,TJMAN, 08/01/2003,axiom,4,"The Axiom from Isuzu has a styling that 
is eye catching and modern.  The 
interior works well however the rear 
seats needs to becme a little more 
simplistic to fold down. All in all a 
great value in 4 x 4's.  "
isuzu,axiom,2003,barati, 08/01/2003,Awesome Axiom,4,"This is bye far the best riding Midsize 
SUV on the market today. I've driven 
every type, and the Axiom was the only 
one that road like a luxury car and 
with one switch of a button, the 
suspension tightens up and it drives 
and hugs the road like a sports car."
isuzu,axiom,2003,Mpfeltr, 08/05/2003,I've had no problems - it turns heads,5,"It always seems funny to me where 
reviews come from.   Every veh I've 
seemed to own doesnt make it what 
Reviews state as top 10.  Perhaps I 
like to be different.  Anyway pricewise 
my axiom is middle of the road.  Appeal 
wise it turns head, and for me I'm glad 
it not a clone seen everywhere.  I've 
had not a single problem with it and I 
now have 20K on it.  My gas mileage 
hovers around 19mpg c/h and I'm a lead 
foot.  Rebadged Rodeo.. not!"
isuzu,axiom,2003,edf100, 08/18/2003,good so far,5,"only had a short time but seems real 
solid.as a previous owner of 61 other 
vehicles I am more than qualified to 
give a realistic view.I have owned 
most sport utes including 4 grand 
cherokee v8's,4 runners,land 
cruisers,blazers and many others.feels 
light and agile compared to american 
sport utes and gas milage is at least 
20% better."
isuzu,axiom,2003,J&J, 07/21/2003,Sweet,4,"Great Car/ SUV !!

and proceeded to put 5000 miles on the 
way from Illinois to Arizona.No 
regrets except for lower than expected 
MPG. I constantly get looks and 
inquiries on what make it is. Handles 
and brakes well and accelerates 
quickly I am sick and tired 
of ""editors of magazines and Edmunds"" 
berating this vehicle. By far and away 
the best SUV on the road for the 
money. Looks like no other SUV. Buy 
one!! You won't be sorry."
isuzu,axiom,2003,Edgrr, 09/19/2003,My First Isuzu,4,"So far, no a single problem.  I am 
amazed at how well it responds when

Ascender have the looks of the Axiom in 
the future editions."
isuzu,axiom,2003,tami j, 09/26/2003,ROTTEN EGG SMELL,3," Immediately after purchasing the 
vehicle we noticed a rotten egg smell 
from the exhaust and have had it in 3 
times to be investigated and to no 
avail, the dealer says that Isuzu says 
it is a ""normal"" smell for their 
engine and there is nothing I can do 
about it, besides reducing the sulfur 
content in my gasoline.   The 
suspension is horrible in this vehicle 
and the steering nearly requires 20 
turns to pull a sharp turn off.  
Overall, we are not happy with this 
vehicle at all and our hands are tied 
because the value dropped by $8,000.00 
in value 4 months after our purchase.  "

if you're taller than 6'3"" ask your 
dealer about where to go for a seat 
conversion -- more leg room is needed! 
The TOD is awesome.  The V6, even 
though needs some help on hills, has 
more tourque than it appears.  If 
you're in a hurry the TOD is a 
lifesaver on wet pavment.  It engages 
at ease.  the Sport mode will save your 
shocks and struts on pothole-filled 
roads.  Don't be fooled by the size of 
the tires -- they could be wider for 
more grip around corners."

The one I have willn't free wheel

It down shift out of over drive

3.50. One reason I think this is not 
normal it doesn't happen everytime.  I 
don't think this should happen.
Would like to know if anyone else has 
this promblem.  I would think this 
cuts down on miles per gallon. Back 
door is to narrow doesn't open wider 
enough for easy exit. This simply a 
bad design in the car.  Really no 
reason why the back door should be 
this way.  I different hing could 
solve this problem.

I read the other reports and that helped with my buying this car, so I hope mine will help also. If you find one of these cars I say buy it, so far I love it.

a year now with 24,000 miles and not a 
single problem.  However, I am very 
disappointed with the resale value and 
now feel locked in to owning this 
truck for many years in order to break 
even.  Although they call this 
a ""crossover"", it is only that way in 
terms of looks.  This thing is 
definitely still a truck underneath 
and not a very smooth performer, 
although it certainly has adequate 
power and feels very solid on the 
road.  It's a good value if you can 
get one new for under $24k, otherwise 
there are a ton of other choices worth 
the extra price.  You just have to 
compare everything, dont be sold on 
looks alone."

like trying to stop a freight train.

The vehicle continues to move an extra 
3 to 5 terrifying feet when stopping on 
on dry pavement with the brakes fully 
engaged from a speed of no more than 20 
mph, and of course the ""abs"" kicks in 
for no apparent reason.

I grew tired of replacing head gasket s on the on the Toyotas,so I traded for an 1995 trooper and instantly seen the light and before long had 3 isuzus in the stable me my wife and oldest son ,and have never looked back I have a 2001 isuzu trooper with 256k on the odometer and all I have done is replaced the starter at  165 k , And now 2016. I  bought a 2003 axiom a year ago and we love it .have put 18k on it this last year has the 3.5 v6  like my trooper and smooth as silk .could use more adjustment on the driver seat . We are partial to the high seat position of the troopers I have looked at many and there is nothing out there to compare with the troops driving position its like flying a plan..but the axiom is still great in it lower driving position..ISUZU COME BACK !!!!

It came with a receipt from the previous owner who had put in a new transmission & fuel pump within the last year.  It drives beautifully & is very conferable.  It passed smog with no problem.  I'm very pleased with my purchases.  I spent all the money I had been saving for the past 12 years on the car so it better last me for a long time.  I'm disabled & my wheelchair fit in the back easily.

Loved the styling, the interior, 
biggest complaint, driver's seat

It was still running great so we decided to purchase another Isuzu.  The Axioms were being discontinued so we got a bargain on it.  The car now has 71,000 miles on it and has been in for repair twice within the last six months for the same problem.  No warning lights come on, but the engine starts to make a strange noise and stops.  Both times the vehicle was almost completely out of oil with no warning whatsoever.  It shows no signs of leaking underneath and is not exhausting black smoke.  The dealers have been vague in diagnosing the problem.  I believe the car is cursed and has been a lemon all along."

I personally like the dash but does have a lot to it. You just have to get used to it. My only complaint would be the rubber stripping around the doors it seems to move or come out of its fasteners and not fit as well as I'm sure as when it was new.

isuzu,axiom,2004,Charbojr, 10/22/2005,Update on ole reliable,4,It's been over a year now with over 20K miles clocked and the Axe is holding up nice. We got new tires and that has made a tremendous difference in the handling of this vehicle (Bridgestone Dueler Alenza tire's). No more tire squeal or front end plow in the rain and has smoothed out the ride a bit. However the fit and finish on this car is still unnerving. Our sunroof is shot and the door seams (stuffing) is pulling away from the doors. Not exactly the things you want happening to a $28K truck. Still the warranty has saved us and this SUV doesn't mind being abused. Thanks Isuzu.

owned for years prior to purchasing the

its bland competitors.  The Axiom is a 
head-turner with many people asking 
about it. It is not the cookie-cutter 
SUV.  It is worth the test drive.  "

isuzu,axiom,2004,Richard Hall, 03/08/2004,Its better than the Editors think,4,"I am 53, a car enthusiast and race. 
Owned Jeeps for years and go off road. 
The editors rating seems inconsisent.  
We paid $22000 for a new 2003 with 
2004s at $24500. A Kia Sorento came 
close but Jeeps etc very over priced 
in comparison   Keep the tires at 26 
lb and ride is fine.  No p[roblems 
with steering and room for 6fter. 
Controls are intuitive and simple to 
use. Our latest easy higway run at 70 
mph resulted in 23 mpg I expect 
overall use to be 20 mpg or 4 pm 
better than our Jeep. I am a Certified 
Financial Planner professional and 
believe long term costs willb e lower 
than buying a 2 or 3 year old Jeep. 
I think the Axiom is a great value."

From its direct injection engine to the exterior to the interior, I love everything about this SUV. Isuzu makes products that not only last forever, they also look GREAT! The 250hp DI 3.5 engine has plenty of power. The traction control (TOD) is awesome -- last winter I had to pass some large trucks in heavy snow on I-25, slick conditions; it never missed a beat. Beautiful interior. I love the two-tone + leather + the digital center panel (Euro look) and the 6 disc player. The performance, looks, and style can't be matched by any American vehicle. I want another one. My 1995 Rodeo still runs great too!"

Was very pleasantly surprised by the vehicle and quickly came to love it.  Great mid-size design with quality interior layout and materials. It was gutsy in its acceleration and speed and was more than adequate towing (5000 lbs). Got very good gas mileage and was comfortable even on a 12 hour non-stop trip to Tennessee.  I would definitely recommend as a starter car for a teenager, or a commuter car for anyone. Plenty of leg room in the back seat plus plenty of cargo space in the back."

I bought the truck from a private party, and older man, who had crashed it once and had the front right end reconstructed, I have never had any problems with that.  I also bought it with a cap, which I highly recommend if you put luggage in there (moving back and forth from college didn't get it wet), or if you bring your dog along (I prefer my dog in the front seat if space allows), or if people think your truck bed is a trash barrel (that's aggravating)!!"

Basic, yes, but reliable, comfortable, and I've liked my truck.  It doesn't have many features (has roll-up windows) and has a bit of cabin noise, but it has great AC/heat and the radio stays on after you turn off the key till you open the door.  My first Isuzu pickup (1990) was built by Isuzu, but this one was actually built by GM -- one reason I decided on another GM vehicle this time.

It needed a bit of work to address the previous owner's neglect, but has otherwise been a stellar performer.  Most people whine incessantly about the ""chintzy"" interior.  To them, I say go buy a car.  I want my truck to hold up to getting dirty, and don't want crud to get embedded in soft squishy plastic.  I seriously believe that these trucks never caught on as GM and Isuzu spent nothing to advertise them.  How can people know that there is a good truck out there if they never heard of it?  As it is a Colorado with a different grille, I just stop by my local Chevy dealership for service."

isuzu,i-series,2006,bishopcharles, 03/26/2006,I-280 base model,5,4 cylinder has surprising power in 5th gear at 70+mph for passing.  I think this is due to the fact that this engine gets to its torque maximum at 2800 RPM; other 4 cylinders don't reach peak torque until you wind up the engine to 4500 to 5000.  I drove it up very steep gravel roads in ice and snow  and even though it is 2WD it had good traction.  Best truck for the price.  
isuzu,i-series,2006,RED, 06/17/2006,"Great truck, great price...",5,"In the days of struggling car makers and a struggling middle class it is hard to find an automobile that is reasonably priced, yet high quality.  Isuzu has done well with their launch of the I series.  Yes the interior quality lacks and the performance isn't up to par, but gas mileage is great and the cab is spacious.  My i280 didn't come with keyless entry or a car alarm; however, theft is easily deterred with the utilization on GM's passlock system and I'm getting used to using my key to open the door.  All in all it is worth the price.  At less than $17,000 (not including trade) it is highly recommended.  I am highly pleased with this truck.  Advice?  See it for yourself."

It tows a 1000# trailer every weekend, doesn't seem to effect the fuel mileage. I'm averaging 15-16 mpg in town, 17-19 mpg on the road. No wind noise in the door seals at speed. Other than that I think it is the best truck for the money."

isuzu,i-series,2007,Doktorschley, 04/17/2017,Best vehicle ever owned in 50 years of driving!,5,"This decked-out I-370 is the best vehicle I have ever owned. With 247,000 miles on it, the only work it has EVER needed was a power-steering pump, rack-and-pinion at 222,000. The all-leather interior with motorized heated seats makes it a dream for long-distance travel. Performance-wise, it got the best gas mileage in its class when I bought it, and I improved that with a straightened tail pipe (to accommodate a full-sized spare) and the addition of a Magna-Flo muffler system ($164) and a K & N air filter ($50). It has better power than a comparable Tacoma and better gas mileage (Highway average at speed is about 23-24 mpg, but I have gotten as high as 31 mpg!). The 4WD on the fly system is also great. It is an Isuzu design, with requisite GM features such as automatic on-off lights (interior and exterior) that never let you burn out your battery. I have always run Big-O AT OFF-ROAD radials, and have gotten as much as 90,000 miles out of a set of tires on five-way rotation. The secret to owning this vehicle is regular servicing at a reliable dealer, and a good wash, including undercarriage, every two weeks. The fact that it is a GMC-Canyon/Chevrolet-Colorado clone makes any parts replacement extremely affordable.

isuzu,i-series,2007,Aggie, 07/02/2007,Fits the need...,3,"Overall I have to say that the vehicle isn't the best nor the worst I've ever had. I will say that I am impressed with the handling it has in the ""Urban Jungle."" The powertrain is average, feels like it could use the Ascender/Trailblazer I-6 engine.  The vehicle could have used a few more hours of development in the interior. The plastics feel unrefined, yet solid. The center console leaves you wanting more. The seating arrangement could use adjustable headrests for better comfort. Compared to the Frontier/Tacoma trucks it feels about a generation behind. Overall, it gets you from A to B, and I would suggest trading up to one of the afore mentioned vehicles when you can."
isuzu,i-series,2007,MtnRoad, 03/09/2016,Did exactly what I needed it to,4,"I owned the 2007 Isuzu i-290 4cyl, auto trans w/ OD. This review is after I sold it before I moved overseas. I want people to know how good the truck was when I owned it. I bought it with low miles from a ""stealership."" Despite the goat-rope and lies spilling out of the stealership employees mouths trying to convince me to purchase warranties and other stuff, I managed to escape with a good price after they had me waiting and waiting almost 7 hours to pay cash for it. Idiots.  My experience at the stealership was so bad in fact I will never go back into one to buy a car. My Isuzu was gently owned and had low miles, about 22,000. I paid $11,500 and it was exactly what I wanted. No frills dependable transportation with utility. I hadn't had much luck in the past with power options on other cars so this truck was perfect as it did NOT have power windows or power door locks.  I have to admit the Isuzu front end looks a lot better than the Chevy Colorado and GMC Canyon. I got a lot of compliments on the truck. It had great storage behind the front row bench seat and it also had the extra side doors and two jumper seats that folded up. I used the truck bed quite a lot to move heavy equipment, large items, and on one occasion I helped a neighbor move a piano that was extremely heavy. It took six people who barely picked up and loaded the piano in the back of the truck. Yeah it was low in the back and probably way over the payload but it had no problem. Acceleration on the truck with the 4cyl was always pretty good. Gas mileage was good too. The interior was really nice and functional. The AC was freezing cold and all the controls and everything worked great. I didn't want to sell the truck but had to when I moved overseas. While I was overseas I saw several Isuzu trucks just like mine that had diesel engines and I wanted one. It amazes me how you see all these great vehicles and fuel efficient engine options while overseas but we don't have them in the US. I can't really fault the truck as it did everything I needed during my ownership minus one small issue that would come up every now and then...The truck sometimes would not start. It would crank and crank but would not start, and the security icon would be illuminated on the gauge cluster. After a few minutes it would start no problem and the security icon would disappear. Only happened a couple times. I had no idea how or why that would happen, and most likely was due to something I was doing with the keys and ignition...who knows. I would buy another one if I saw one with low miles but people don't really sell them. Great truck, very tough, and looked good.
"
isuzu,i-series,2007,NuMex, 05/17/2018,Best $ I've spent in a long time on a vehicle,5,"This is Isuzu's version of the GM Colorado/Canyon.  As such, resale is lower, which I took full advantage of.  For the money as a basic truck, it's been a great buy.  Interior materials are cheesy but durable.  At 200,000 miles, still runs like a champ, uses no oil, and doesn't show any signs of slowing down.  Other than regular maintenance, only repairs have been for minor things like replacing the tailgate latch.  This engine family was designed for durability and low maintenance, and in my experience this has been proven to be true.

isuzu,i-series,2008,BPA, 08/19/2008,Excellent Power,4,"Quite a Spartan little truck, though I was surprised by the I290's peppy performance.  Much better than my 2.3 liter, I-4 Ford Ranger.  Mileage was better, too.  It handles very well on the road with the exception of body roll on tight turns and has a wider than expected turning radius.  Visibility is very good and gives the feeling of zero blind spots.  All of the controls are easily manipulated and ergonomically placed, plus the instrument panel is logically laid out. The vinyl seat of the base model leaves much to be desired.  Base model appointments are very base model and make the Ranger XL feel almost plush. Mine has been in for a front-end rattle which will require multiple visits."
isuzu,i-series,2008,Nan, 01/04/2008,Great so far,4,"My first 400 miles, all city, got 24.8 miles to the gallon. I can't wait to try a distance trip. The little booster seats in the back have wonderful hooks for the child car seat and are safe. The windows are perfect for viewing all around. My little girl loves that she has a back seat speaker for the radio, and a window just the right height to be able to see. The heater does not blast me on the foot as some vehicles do and have louvers that really close. I am long legged and this little truck gives me plenty of leg room.  That is a major plus. Driving it up the mountain to the top of the Sandia's was no problem even though there was plenty of snow and ice to deal with. A plus so far"
isuzu,i-series,2008,Jon, 10/28/2010,"36,000 mile review",4,"I bought my I-290 with just 20 miles on it. Recently I finally turned over the 36,000 mile mark so thought it was appropriate to write a 36,000 mile review.  Bought the truck in phoenix, and have had it while I lived there ( handled the heat extremes well ) I moved to Wyoming for awhile and gave it a -40 degree f winter, and popped the radiator at 12,000 miles. I was displeased that the vehicle could not be serviced at the local gm dealer and had to be towed 150 miles away to an isuzu dealer, and i was stuck having to figure a way to go get it when it was fixed. Other than that this truck has been reliable. The tire sensors are a bit touchy when the weather gets cold."
isuzu,i-series,2008,LA I290, 05/18/2008,Best Small Truck On the Road!,5,"This truck is all it is made out to be.  It has a very powerful motor that will easily give you 24 mpg. Sometimes up to 28 mpg. The 19 gallon tank will get you anywhere from 300 to 400 miles.  The tire pressure monitoring system is very sensitive. On a cold day it will read ""low pressure""."
isuzu,i-series,2008,J-Cash, 07/02/2020,Bought it used,5,"I bought it used with roughly 108k miles and I've put almost 4k miles on it so far.

I bought the truck for it's ability to move things ie furniture, kayaks, etc. I haven't used it to tow anything yet but the mounts in the bed for ratchet straps/tie downs have held so far when using them. The bed is only mid sized but I was able to fit a one passenger and a two passenger kayak semi-overlapped just fine in the bed with the ends going over the cab of the truck.

I also bought the truck for it's low price compared to a Tacoma and for it's fuel economy ratings I saw online. I was disappointed when I ended up getting 13 city/15 hwy. I replaced the throttle body, cleaned the mass air flow sensor, replaced the spark plugs and changed the air filter and now I'm getting roughly 15 city/17 hwy and that's driving it conservatively. According to fueleconomy.gov I should be getting 18 city/24 hwy. I'm going to replace the O2 sensors and see if that improves my gas mileage at all.

It doesn't have a lot of get up and go like my 2008 Mustang GT did but I guess it's what you'd expect from a 4 cylinder engine.

I do like it's reliability which is what I look for in any vehicle that I consider purchasing. I recently moved half way across the country, making the trip in under a day and a half, and the truck held up just fine. It does however seem to struggle to get up to highway speeds ie 70 mph, that might just be because of the transmission in mine, but once there it can get up to 80 mph no problem with the rpm staying below 3250-3000 if I'm not mistaken.

Handling is fine, it does have a wide turn radius so keep that in mind, I mean it is a truck after all.

It's the perfect daily driver and easy to maintain.

The oil drain pan bolt and oil filter are easily accessible as well as the transmission pan bolts if you're going to replace the transmission fluid, filter and gasket (there's no drain bolt for the transmission pan but you could install one if you wanted to). There's also a plastic oil catcher/funnel like thing below the oil filter that's attached to the frame rail, which is nice for when draining the oil into a drain pan.

Everything I've replaced (including the things I've already mentioned that I've replaced) has been an easy job so far. I've replaced the rear brake drums, serpentine(drive) belt, belt tensioner, wiper blades, a tail light and I even did a brake flush with little to no problems.

The only thing maintenance wise that I didn't like was when I did a coolant flush. You have to disconnect a hose connected to the radiatior, there's no drain valve. When you remove the clamp and remove the rubber hose from the radiator the coolant comes spewing out, making it a messy job. Also, the fuel filter and fuel pump are a combined assembly which I don't like. To make matters worse, they both rest inside the gas tank. You can reach the assembly from the top of the gas tank, but you have to drop the whole gas tank in order to do so. I also wanted to be able to replace my fuel filter in order to possibly improve fuel economy, but since it's in a combined assembly with the fuel pump, I'd have to shell out $250-$260 for a whole new assembly. The cost alone is enough to make it not worth replacing and you'd also be throwing out a fully functioning fuel pump which is a waste of money and resources in my opinion. I'll deal with the slightly reduced gas mileage until the fuel pump goes out.

Also, the A/C during a really hot day might not immediately feel cool but it will eventually start cooling the cab off as soon as you start driving at a decent speed.

All in all, so far I like this truck and would recommend it or even sell it to a friend. For someone with a budget, this is the perfect truck in my opinion.

isuzu,rodeo,2000,briantwomey, 04/06/2011,Too bad Isuzu stopped making the Rodeo,4,"I bought this new in 2000.
It now has 125K miles and purs like a kitten.
Feels the bumps in the road more than some other SUV's and that's because the Rodeo was built on a truck frame.
I understood this when I bought it.
The Rodeo came with a 10 year 100,000 mile warranty.
Try to find that today.
You may get a 5 year 100K mi but nobody wants to go 10 years.
Other than the usual maintenance wear and tare stuff my Isuzu had been great.
I think this year I'll replace the sound system and look for some new rims.
It has great reaction and control and also great pick-up."
isuzu,rodeo,2000,deckards, 02/17/2010,Reliable,3,"With a forward thinking grill design and overall body shape, this doesn't look like a 10 year old mid-sized SUV sitting in my driveway.   Bought over a year ago, I've put 30,000 miles on it...bringing the total to 161K.  Major repair was a throttle body when idling issues appeared but has been running perfectly ever since.  200K shouldn't be a problem.  Overall a really good purchase for a safe vehicle that me, the kids and the dog enjoy."
isuzu,rodeo,2000,jays cars, 01/23/2010,Izusu's best years...,4,"Our family has owned our Rodeo since new and as of 01/2010 it has 81400 miles and the only thing we had done was the fuel pump had to be replaced in 07 (under warranty), but it has outlasted all our cars and trucks. I love that its soo strong and reliable, I'm not sure if i will ever find a vehicle like it again or if they even make them anymore. I think the 1999- 2009 Isuzu our one of the best SUV made. So wish i could find a used one at the right price, would buy it in a minute."
isuzu,rodeo,2000,JenniferD, 09/07/2004,You get what you pay for,2,"Until November 2003, I loved my Rodeo.
It ran like a dream, with just
minor irritations. Upon taking it
in for a regular oil change, the
dealership informed me that at 38000
miles, the entire engine needed to be
replaced. They admitted that it was
caused by a flaw in the design.

At 50K, it was towed in for an
electrical short that made the car
completely stop on a busy road. The
dealership made the problem worse. Now,
electrical problems cause
cruise control to turn on randomly. The
dealership will not support me, Isuzu
Corporate will not support me. Time for
a trade-in."

The engine is strong, has no leaks, and is very clean. The only disappointment I have is that it drives like a minivan and doesn't take sharp turns smoothly. The tires were wearing unevenly till I adjusted the camber."
isuzu,rodeo,2000,mztalker19, 08/13/2009,I love this SUV,4,"I have a family of five now and we need a van. I am going to hate to see my truck go. It has been so good to me. I have made multiple trips to Missouri from Michigan in this truck. I have not had any problems with this truck. Helpful reminders is to make sure you tighten the gas cap past three clicks and keep oil in it is about all. I have noticed that the oil tends to burn a little quicker than other vehicles BUT it doesn't leak it. Has never been a big deal. I am VERY impressed with this truck and whomever buys it from me is going to be happy! Good luck, you won't regret it."
isuzu,rodeo,2000,smeeks1, 05/02/2008,Still Going!,4,"I have 118,000 miles and weve been through a lot together! When I first purchased it (had 15k miles) it had an engine switch problem, dealer had to have it towed in to repair. At about 90,000 miles I experienced electrical issues with my AC, I have to jiggle it for it to be extra cold. This does use a lot of oil for some reason, I change it religiously 2800 miles. This is my first car, I think its very easy to handle. I whip it around quite easily and never get that ""tipping"" feeling. The design still looks pretty good for an 8yr old car. I plan on keeping my rodeo until it dies and I dont think thats anytime soon. I would recommend it overall. Its really fun to drive, great visibility too!"

Aside from normal maintenance, I have only had 400.00 repair of a leaking plug on transmission. at 150k, the brake pads still had 30% wear left - incredible. Its still spunky, and has enuf power. Cd changer went out - I hear that is common. Too bad resale at this point is not real good - at KBB prices, it will be a great deal for someone should I decide to part with it. "

isuzu,rodeo,2000,Douglas, 05/04/2005,Very Nice,3,This has been a pleasant purchase for me.  As an owner of only small cars before I was not sure if I would like this vehicle but I have.  I have had a few things repaired (all under warranty) and have no real major complaints.  It's fun and comfortable to drive but not nearly as stable as a car.  I never do anything abrupt for fear of losing control.  Excellent in the snow and off road.  Has a great stereo. even though it had to be replaced once.  Have gone coast to coast with no problems.

The major reason we decided on it was that it was the only vehicle we could agree on.  In my opinion (which my wife gave me permission to have), it is the most muscular and attractive SUV ever built.  The 3.2L V6 is not an astounding powerplant, but it is lively and reliable;  it makes plenty of torque for light-duty towing and trips up the canyon, but it won't set any speed records.  We have been very pleased with the simple and intelligent layout of the interior and the seats are  supportive on long drives.  Look for a Rodeo in a lighter color to really see the muscular fender flares and appreciate the design.  "

and exterior design. Windshield moldings had to be removed and re-glued 
due to excessive wind noise. The front suspension was factory bad and had 
to be modified to level the vehicle out. The brakes stick when a hard stop is 
required. The rear axle yoke had to have special grease and parts to make it 
function properly. There were spot weld rust through around the rear lift gate 
from the factory. The ride was rough. Wind, Rain and Road noise were

Isuzu dealers are few and far between and they act like it.  My dealer was never able to identify problems (or even agree there was a problem) on the first visit making each repair a multi visit battle (I did eventually win many, but not all of the battles).  

Unless you absolutely can&#8217;t afford something else &#8211; I&#8217;d look elsewhere.  Most any other vehicle out there is superior to this one.

isuzu,rodeo,2000,catcher10us, 12/02/2005,Excellent,4,"Have had this Rodeo since new, now almost 90k miles. Other than normal maintenance items, brakes and an intake gasket, this truck has been great. Still runs strong and honestly, was looking at something new, but nothing runs better than this. This was my third Isuzu, 2 Troopers and the Rodeo. Sorry Isuzu has given up on the US marketplace."
isuzu,rodeo,2000,Fernando, 01/13/2006,Great SUV,4,Great mid-size SUV. No problems with the car after 5 years of owning it. Very smooth drive and very reliable. The only drawback is the fact that there's a lot of noise in the cabin and of course it consumes more fuel that I would like to but it is the price we pay for an SUV.
isuzu,rodeo,2000,answerinstl, 04/19/2007,Overall,4,"I have put over 35K miles on my Rodeo in less than 2 years.  I love this SUV.  It is comfy, roomy, and economical.  95K miles currently and still going real strong with no signs of slipping.  I would buy another no problems here."
isuzu,rodeo,2000,Shar, 05/12/2003,Nice SUV for the price,4,"I think the rodeo is very good for its 
price, even though it has a few 
drawbacks, every vehicle does.  The 
seatback latch cover fell off, the 
plastic peice that covers the door 
light came off, I do get a squeak 
somewhere (don't know where). The ride 
is a little rough, but compared to an 
expedition where my head hit the 
ceiling when i went over a 
pothole...its not too bad. The power is 
good, but not excellent. Kinda sluggish 
on the highway. The breaks are 
efficient enough, even though I get the 
anti lock shake, as i call it every now 
and again.  The handling is a little on 
the looser side, but not enough to 
really make a difference.  "
isuzu,rodeo,2000,Bob R., 05/23/2003,This SUV has been trouble-free for me,4,"Even though the Rodeo gets an overall 
bad rap by reviewers, it's given me 
little trouble after 39,000 miles and 
almost 34 months of driving. I had to 
have my noisy front door hinges 
repaired (service bulletin and quickly 
fixed) and I've just noticed a little 
tear in the front driver's cloth seat 
with a metal pin in view. That's it! "
isuzu,rodeo,2000,dyma82, 06/04/2003,Humm...somebody is oicking on Isuzu,5,"I have had my Isuzu for three years
already, and I am really please with it
performance so far. I have never had a
serious problem with it. The most
terrible problem I had was my rear wiper
stopped working after three years of
use. I found that acceptable. I found my
Isuzu Rodeo really reliable and some
friends of mine who own Rodeos also
speak hight of it. I don't think there
is any SUV out there other than Isuzu
Rodeo from which you can get so much
power out of a 3.2 6 cylinder engine."
isuzu,rodeo,2000,Dan, 03/20/2002,It's Cheap & You get what you pay for,2,"I have about 52,000 miles on my 2000 Rodeo.  The ride has grown increasingly bouncy; it's now feels similar to a carnival ride.  This is particularly bad, because it aggravates this vehicles rattle quotient - everything rattles.
Isuzu dealers are few and far between and they act like it.  My dealer was never able to identify problems (or even agree there was a problem) on the first visit making each repair a multi visit battle (I did eventually win many, but not all of the battles).  

Unless you absolutely can&#8217;t afford something else &#8211; I&#8217;d look elsewhere.  Most any other vehicle out there is superior to this one.  
Run; don't walk, out of your Isuzu dealer."
isuzu,rodeo,2000,Eric V, 06/20/2003,Just eh...,2,"This is one of the more attractive 
SUV's and I am pleased with it's 
performance though it does have some 
issues.  One happens to be the wind 
noise when driving on the highway.  
Another issue is the climate controls, 
they seem as though they belong in my 
old GEO.  On an overall scale of 1 to 
10, it gets a 5."
isuzu,rodeo,2000,chipface, 06/21/2003,had alot of suv's this ones been best,4," Bought new after my '99 durango was 
totaled. Never had it back to dealer 
for anything. Oil changes and a new 
battery have been it. No squeaks, 
rattles nothing. Very smooth power, 
added a flowmaster muffler and k&n 
filter, no problems. Gas mileage is 
typical, even better then most. Durango 
was 11 at best mpg. Ford explorer 4.o 
was at 14. Isuzu is at 16-19 mpg. 
Depreciation is only setback. Shouldn't 
be considering they built the rodeo for 
honda as a passport. Best vehicle I'vve 
owned for no problems in 20 years."

isuzu,rodeo,2001,eroeder7966, 01/12/2011,BEWARW!!! Stay Away from 98-02 Rodeos. MAJOR SAFTEY RECALL!!,3,"I've owned my 01 Rodeo LS since 06. Got it with 58,286 miles. To this day looks and runs like new with the exception of check engine light caused buy sending unit. Love the truck. But on November 23,2010 while traveling 40mph the bracket connecting the trailing arm to the frame broke away causing the vehicle to sway out of control. This problem is common to 90-95% of all 98-02 Isuzu Rodeos, Axioms and Honda Passports. Both manufactures havea fix for the brackets, however these fixes will only work on a small percentage of the affected vehicles due to excessive frame rust. My 01 Rodeo with only 81,192 miles was deemed unrepairable Isuzu is now in the process of buying it back for only $4500."
isuzu,rodeo,2001,Vince, 05/04/2010,Happy Camper,4,"78,000 miles when I bought it, now 161,000. Most reliable vehicle I've owned, but at 120,000 I had preventive maintenance done to it also, installed a new timing belt, water pump, oil pump, and belt tensioner. All four items came together as a parts kit and they are all together in the engine too, kit made sense to do all. Could do better on oil consumption, but not too terrible. Uses cheap fuel sending units and replacements are cheap too, I replaced the first one myself at 81,000 and the second one at 158,000, cost less than $40 each. I get a ABS light when the trans fluid is low once a year, have to add fluid through drain plug. Lots of shops scam people on this, check levels 1st and save $$$!"
isuzu,rodeo,2001,MWA3C, 07/16/2010,Not Shabby,4,"Bought this ISUZU RODEO based on looks and handling with 110,000 miles on her. Burns about 1qt of oil every 2500 miles or so using 15w40 (owners manual suggests 15w40 and up, go with it, 10w30 will just run right out of her). Overall not a bad truck, could use a little more HP under the hood but for a 3.0 L V6 it's not horrible.  The suspension is a bit hard on the back with not a lot of travel so you hit the frame bumpers often..  Overall I find long drives are really comfortable.  Currently have 155,000 miles on it and still going strong. Regularly driven on 6 hour drives between states w/o issue."
isuzu,rodeo,2001,Good Enough, 09/09/2010,Longest I've ever owned vehicle,4,"I bought this thing used with 12,000 miles on it. I've had the same issues it seems everyone has with the Rodeo. The check engine light has been on since it had 65,000 miles on it. The gas gauge issue was fixed once with about 85,000 miles on it. Now the same problem is back. I ignore the check engine light and just reset the tripometer each time I fill it up and put gas in when I get to 250-275 miles to be safe. I've had no major mechanical issues. I had the transmission serviced at around 85,000 to replace the gaskets. Nothing more. After reading others reviews I consider myself lucky. This is the third Rodeo I've owned. I still get around 18 MPG and it still tows camper and small boat."
isuzu,rodeo,2001,Love My Truck, 07/08/2009,Great Truck,4,"Other than the usual maintenance at 100,000, it has been great! Transmission rebuild at 135000, but no other problems. I really wish that Isuzu was still selling this model here in the US. I would love to have a new one. (After another 100,000!)"
isuzu,rodeo,2001,redg, 03/16/2011,Problems? Maybe a couple small ones,4,"I'm in California.
No salted roads, not much rain or snow.
I've read the reviews of rusted frames but mine has no rust.
I bought the car, a previous rental, one year old and, except for the fuel sender, replaced at 75000 mi. and the recurring engine light for the egr valve (Just remove it and clean it...easy to do) it's performed flawlessly.
Only gets 20mpg on the road and uses a quart of oil (I run 5-30 synthetic) between changes.

Rough riding without a full load of people.
I love this car.
Plenty of power and nimble handling,
I guess the winter drive selection must sense temperature because it only worked once...in winter.
Power drive is a nice touch.
A poor man's Honda Passport"
isuzu,rodeo,2001,TCope, 07/04/2010,"Good, but",3,"We bought a 4-cyl Rodeo brand new, loved the exterior design; paint is still good at 82k miles.  Almost immediately had trouble with brake drums and rotors that Isuzu would not cover.  Harder to get service now that they are out of business.  Had to replace exhaust manifold twice, and now EGR valve and fuel tank sensor have gone bad.  Used to get 26-30 mpg highway, now 16-17 mpg in town.  4-cyl just doesn't have enough power, and with rear while drive it is terrible in the snow.  If you're buying, look for a 6-cyl with 4WD.  We loved driving the truck, but we're through with the repair bills."
isuzu,rodeo,2001,Loved it!!!, 09/03/2010,Great fun reliable vehicle,4,"I loved this SUV. NEVER once failed me. There was only one problem with it that had something to do with the axles but the mechanics could never figure it out. Even the small things that couldn't be fixed, it never failed to start up and drive anywhere. I could tell it was starting to die though, at only 93000 miles. It didn't have much longer to go. It was very well taken care of, i just don't believe they're meant to last very long. "
isuzu,rodeo,2001,transam402002, 03/05/2002,Rodeo 2001,2,"The worst part about this vehicle is the inflated price.  A vehicle that costs $27000 is only worth, according to Nada and the Isuzu Salesmen, only $17000 a year later.  According to all the books the vehicle only depreciates in value an average of 3000 a year.  How does that work?  
Secondly, it takes forever to get used to the steering wheel and where it is situated.
Thirdly, it is extremely loud when driving on the highway.  You would think you are driving a soft top."
isuzu,rodeo,2001,F Long, 07/09/2007,Biggest mistake I ever made.,2,"I purchased this car in Oct 06. It has been in the shop 4X'S for transmission problems, just had trans overhauled as of today still not fixed.  I only put 6000 miles on it because I never get to drive it. Its always in the shop for weeks at a time. It rides like an elephant, very bumpy ride. If they ever fix it I'm trading it in ASAP. I will never buy a Rodeo again. Exterior looks great but don't be fooled. If you see it on the dealership lot, run the other way as fast as you can. "
isuzu,rodeo,2001,polarzu, 04/21/2008,4cyl 5 speed,3,"Bought new, have 60m miles on it. Not bad for the price. It has lots of cargo space and seating room with a strong ac/htr system that blows ice cold air or hot air. Have had several problems though. Ignition spark missing, odometer counting to fast(still not right),rear windshield wiper quit/front ones stalling, very expensive/inconvenient to have worked on,no one repairs except dealer 50 mi away. If you're wondering why cars are passing you at 65, it's because you're really going 57. It's a pain to figure out what speed you're actually going. Also for a 4 cylinder this is terrible gas mileage. "

I have done all the major maintenance, diff fluid changes, bearings packed, timing belt, etc.  I regret having a vehicle that is in warranty, but there is no dealership nearby.  Isuzu has been TERRIBLE to deal with with on the Fuel sending unit.  They were rude, unrealistic, and changed their story... I would not buy another Izuzu due to that only. "
isuzu,rodeo,2001,Nicolle, 07/30/2009,"Comme ci, comme ca",3,"I absolutely loved driving this truck because it drove like a car, and drove very smoothly. Super comfortable, great features. But it was a rustbox, I had to get rid of it before it got so bad as to knock the value down too far. The transmission started to slip at approx. 85,000 miles. It was noticeable when going from 1st to 2nd gear - it would hold back, then jump into 2nd. Also from reverse back to 1st. Scared me, didn't want to put a new tranny in. Not much else went wrong with this truck though, it was very reliable and a great size. Awful gas mileage though. Isuzus are cheaply made in the undercarriage, I wouldn't recommend buying one older than a couple years if you live near salt."

I was pregnant and specifically wanted 
a small SUV for the ease of getting a 
child in and out of the car seat. I 
didn't want to hurt my back by lifting 
an bending over constantly. The extra 
space for the stroller and misc 
supplies has been a real plus. The 
actual performance of the vehicle has 
been excellent. I haven't had any 
problems what so ever mechanically. 
The pick up is not as powerful as I 
sometimes want it, but then again I 
need to remeber there are children in 
the car now and I don't need to race 
everywhere I go.Overall I'm 
satisfied."
isuzu,rodeo,2001,EC, 03/14/2003,Only the Beginning!,1,"After taking the Rodeo back to the 
dealer 5 times in last 19 months 
(first time after the first 27 days!) for 
the same problem in the front 
wheels, the problem was finally 
diagnosed by an outside mechanic-
wheel bearings! However, the 
problem has caused significant wear 
and cupping of tires (20000 miles on 
vehicle) and while driving, loss of 
brakes. All of this could have been 
avoided if thorough checks would 
have been made! The Rodeo is 
definitely a gas hog-16 mpg!  And 
the engine pinging-another problem 
that started in the first month of 
ownership! Not to mention the 
depreciation. What a mistake!! No 
wonder they give a 120000 mile 
powertrain warranty!"
isuzu,rodeo,2001,bob, 10/07/2008,Still in progress,4,"Bought this Rodeo with 49000 miles on. The first year it was my baby, I loved it. But as time goes on and I learn it's soft spots I wonder if I was smart in buying it. Gas gauge never worked right, now not at all. Stalls when trying to start when warmed up. Tried several tuneups to fix. Now am told it might be intake gasket. Very disappointed in quality of drive train makeup. Tuned up but made no difference. "
isuzu,rodeo,2001,Josh, 01/03/2009,Big Mistake!,2,"I bought this car used at an affordable price.  Now I know why it was so affordable.  Once the fuel gauge gets below 3/4 tank, it constantly floats down to empty and back.  I'm never really sure how much gas I have.  The check engine light comes on constantly and my mechanic says it's an exhaust problem.  The 4 wheel drive only works some of the time, other times it kicks itself out of gear and makes a horrible grinding noise.  Also, the handle to make the passenger seat recline will not stay on, and the front speakers blew after I had the car for 6 months (I don't even listen to the radio much)."

Now it won't start at all. We've taken it to 5 different shops/mechanics, including a dealership & no one can find anything wrong with it. After researching online, it seems like others have had same problem & it has to do with the alarm system-but no one seems to know how to shut the alarm off, bypass it, etc. I don't understand how no one knows how to fix it! We're running out of patience & money! And we bought it w/out a warranty, so it's starting to look like a total loss, which we can't afford! I'm so sick about this & wish we'd never bought this vehicle!"

very suprised of how fast it has 
depreciated, I guess I got what I paid 
for. The interior of the truck just 
screams out cheap. When you feel and 
see the thin plastic material that 
ISUZU used for the dash and other 
parts. I have not had any major 
problems, exept I had to change my rear 
break shoes within 40,000 miles. Good 
power for small truck. Air conditiong 
seems to take forever to kick in. You 
will find yourself like a bobble-head 
when the road gets bumpy. Sleeping 
policemen (speed bumps)seem to be a 
little too much for this truck. If you 
dont mind cheap interior, rough ride, 
poor mpg, then this truck is for you."

2001 LS V6 Rodeo w/ 45k miles late July 
from Pugmire Isuzu of Marietta Georgia, 
great dealership. My previous car was a 
95 Ford Contour so to say the least, 
the Rodeo is an improvement. The V6 
engine is smooth as silk and seems very 
reliable so far. Plenty of power, takes 
hills like a champ!! The engine idle is 
so quite, when I left the dealer the 
day I bought if I thought the engine 
cut off while I was waiting at a 
stoplight. Interoir is nothing fancy 
but I did not buy a SUV for luxury.

isuzu,rodeo,2001,Josh, 01/04/2005,Fun To Drive,4,"I got my Isuzu over the common explorer and other midsize SUVs because it drives like a car, not a truck. It's fun, unless you worry about the gas gauge which seems like it depletes pretty fast...Overall, I'm glad I got the car, the brakes squeak like mad when its wet though. No mechanical problems to speak of. It sputters on startup when its cold, but nevertheless it starts up and goes. "
isuzu,rodeo,2001,Al Ayala, 03/16/2005,KC Fan of Rodeos,4,"I have driven my Rodeo for the last 4 years, with no problems at all.  Besides oil changes and other types of preventive maintenance you have to do on all vehicles my Isuzu is tops.  I had a problem with the fuel pump, but with the extended warranty I had on the vehicle it was taken care of immediately.  After four years that is a pretty good track record in my book."
isuzu,rodeo,2001,Jung, 04/07/2005,Happy so Far,4,"Bought new in 2001. Our Rodeo has been a good truck so far.  Minimum problems.  Only 1 warranty repair (engine sensor)and one repair after  warranty (abs sensor). Great family vehical.  Nice handling for SUV, good power.  Have noticed some salt damage on rims.  Depreciation was very bad first year, but looks to be stablizing.  Would recommend if to someone buying used."
isuzu,rodeo,2001,F.N., 06/03/2005,Very good after almost 4 years,4,"I have to say that after almost 4 years, my Rodeo has held up quite well.  True, I haven't put but 45k miles on it, but its handled them as well as I could have hoped.  I have to admit that I, too, was shocked to find out how badly it depreciated.  I don't understand that.  It gets decent reviews and reliability ratings so why does it lose so much value?  The gas mileage could be a bit better and I have also noticed the spluttering at cold startup but its done that since I bought it so I don't worry about it. Overall, this has been a very comfortable, reliable vehicle.  I just wish it was worth a little more now. "
isuzu,rodeo,2001,Iceman75, 10/06/2005,You get what you pay for.,3,"Good looking vehicle. Dings very easily. Exhaust rattles likes it's coming loose. This happened when it was a year old. Windows fuse is blown, so the windows are stuck in the up position. Rear windshield wiper doesn't work any more either. No idea why. Looking forward to selling it and buying a Mercedes M Class. Got to admit, I got this at a great price with 0% financing."
isuzu,rodeo,2001,huntly, 11/29/2005,Four Years With My Rodeo,4,"No problems other than characteristic fuel usage common to these type vehicles.  Two cross country trips, coast to coast, were fine. Minor alignment problem taken care of by dealer. Great drivetrain warranty not required. After 4 years, I have no regrets other than the failure of the brand to flourish. I previously owned a 1988 Trooper and it was my all-time favorite vehicle. I hated to trade it in, but the time was right. Owned it for 130,000 self maintained miles. While old Trooper was heavy in the maintenance required, the Rodeo has nothing to do, but drive and enjoy. It is so much more in power and great handling than old Trooper. Bad image undeserved. I am a happy owner on 10 year plan."
isuzu,rodeo,2001,A Wolf, 12/17/2005,Tough To Complain,4,"After 4 years & almost 80K, can't really complain. Done basic maintenance only, no unusual problems or costs, and still going strong. Can't complain about the 18-20mpg from a 4x4 SUV that sees a lot of city driving, I think it's darn good. Don't get why people complain. Do run mid grade fuel to eliminate minor knocking. Has some minor squeaks & rattles, but mostly I'm impressed with its ride quality and how well it has held up."

isuzu,rodeo,2001,Harry, 02/10/2007,My Review on 02/10/2007,3,"Purchased my 2001 Rodeo LS 4WD used on 10/02/2002 with 15,000 miles on it.  The 4WD did not work right off due to a bad actuator that had to be replaced.  About a year later the Transmission Position Sensor went out and had trouble putting in gear.  Ran fine for the following 3 years without one problem.  About 6 months ago the TPS went out again, and fixed it myself by cleaning out the dirt.  About a month later or 5 months ago at 78,000 miles, the transmission had to be replaced at a cost of $2000.00.  Aside from the transmission, can't complain too much.  Power is good, the integrity of chassis is good, and rides a little bumpy.  Would not purchase again though."
isuzu,rodeo,2001,Bob, 09/30/2007,"Solid, Reliable Truck",4,"After 4 years and 70,000+ miles I have nothing but good things to say about this truck.  One point I will make, though, is that the Rodeo is a truck. That can be good or bad depending on your needs.  For my needs, it is excellent.  It tows well, has plenty of power, negotiates snowy roads extremely well (and off-road, for that matter). Any complaints about a rough ride and low fuel economy can be attributed to any 4x4 truck. My Subaru rides great and gets 27 mpg but it couldn't pull the hair off of a wet dog.  That's my two cents. Oh, and with 92,000 miles and 2 trips across the country (loaded down, avg 18mpg), it's still running as strong as ever.  Great truck."

Although we do not have a dealer in my city anymore, there are dealers in surrounding cities for servicing if I ever needed them.  I can say that, at 80,000+ miles, I've had no problems with my Rodeo.  I have followed all the scheduled maintenance (not cheap), but the only thing I've ever had to replace were the brakes at 4 years and the battery at 5 years.   Prior cars were Ford Thunderbird, Ford Taurus, Ford Festiva, and Pontiac Sunbird.   I love my Rodeo and highly recommend them. "

disappointed when a body seam broke

it fixed no problems, but everyone 
knows how inconvenient is it to have 
your vehicle in the shop. Overall, I 
really enjoyed the SUV. We realized 
upon purchase, but with the 0% they 
offered, we knew that overabundance of 
Rodeo's, the resale would be terrible. 
We purchased an LSE with all the added 
extras (was featured in the KC, MO 
Autoshow, so it was souped-up) for 
around $29000. Traded it in 2.25 years

about $750 over KBB."

I take it offroad all the time which i've never gotten stuck. I drive it like i stole it atleast 95 mph on the highways everyday and drive in bumper to bumper in afternoons. I haven't had to replace anything really except the belts and a couple batteries. This is an awesome suv

Other than typical wear and maintenance, this car did not need parts replaced or upgraded. The only issue is that the two little exterior pieces under the tail lights/above the bumper started to rust prematurely after the 3rd year of ownership. (A little unsightly.) RWD was fine on dry roads but a little dicey on wet/snowy roads. The 4WD was ideal! Easily drove through unplowed lots or streets where others were getting stuck.

I have driven cross country twice and both were good trips. I also drive motorcycles and that is why my mileage is low.

Very confident in the vehicles safety as I was not injured seriously despite being hit in the driver's side door by a car going 55 mph.  There were very few changes to the '01 compared to the '99, but the subtle changes were good, like the rear wiper automatically returns to its off position when the truck is turned off.

Purchased extended warranty and used it several times. Car had exhaust manifold defects, two failures. Running great for now. Parts are expensive. Several sensor failures. Overall I like the car, bought it for the long run and hope to get 10 years out of it. Front brakes replaced at 114k, timing belt 112k, original tires 56k. Shocks 105k."

I've had this vehicle for 9 years and other than normal wear and tear repairs, have not had any issues.
I am
still getting 23 mpg on the highway; about 19 city.
As long as the routine maintenance is kept up, this vehicle has been a gem."
isuzu,rodeo,2002,Mountain Canuck , 10/20/2010,Often Seen high mileage,4,"Every vehicle line has its lemons. Our Rodeo SE has been a solid and reliable all-round truck. I have been the only owner from 12 km and have beat it around in the snow and through the bush a lot. This year we picked up a 2700 lb (loaded) tent trailer for it to haul. After hauling the trailer fully loaded up a 12-15% minimum highway grade for about 40km, it didn't falter once. In fact it performed very well. Changing all fluids at the regular service intervals helps keep it going. If you are concerned about mileage, change your fuel filter. It's a $12 part and only takes 15- 20mins. Mine is changed yearly due to local delivery of poor fuel quality. Its like driving a new truck every year."
isuzu,rodeo,2002,LittleRodeo, 10/31/2015,Great Little Rodeo!,4,"My parents bought my Isuzu Rodeo new in 2002 from the dealership. I inherited it when it hit 200,000 miles in 2010 (my mom commutes and we did a lot of road trips.) This little SUV has gone through Canyonlands National Park, back roading in Idaho, and has been an every day commuter since 2002. The 4 wheel drive has been excellent throughout the mountain west, and has been used as my vehicle to ski mountains since 2010. It currently has 262,000 miles on it, and while it's lost some power, and the check engine light is on, it seems to just keep on trucking. We treat it with a little more respect now - it doesn't go off roading as often, and I typically keep it in the Salt Lake valley. We have never had any serious maitenance- just a wheel bearing at 230,000 miles. For the cost, it has been probably the best value vehicle my husband I will ever own (and my parents for that matter). I keep saying it's time to get a new car, but it's just the little Rodeo that could... It looks like we will keep it until the end (who knows, it could have 40,000 more miles in it?!)

isuzu,rodeo,2002,Texasgal, 08/28/2010,It's a Winner!,4,"When I bought my rodeo, it already had 100,000 miles on it.  I am at 168,000 now and driving strong.  No problems at all except had to replace tires and alternator.  And I have crack in the radiator.  But other than that, it is very dependable and handles well, especially on dirt, hilly roads.  I just wish it got better gas mileage, only get about 260 miles per tank now.  Use to get almost 300 when I first bought it."
isuzu,rodeo,2002,haroldg48, 03/04/2002,luv my rodeo,4,"It rides a little Truck-like, but compared to other similar sized SUV's we drove, it was the best (Ford Escape, Mazda Tribute, Montero).  Since buying it, love it!"

I have taken it across country 2 times in hot weather and it ran cool and ac worked fine, I got about 27-28 mpg on the trips. The only thing I've done to it is put a battery and a k and n air filter on it in 4 years. It just runs and runs.    "
isuzu,rodeo,2002,FHFMA, 01/07/2010,88000+ and still running strong,4,We bought this SUV new after an issue with a used car we bought from the same dealer. While it wasn't our first choice for SUV I had owned a 1984 Isuzu PU with a diesel engine one of the first in the country and had great service with it. This is my wife's primary vehicle and while it avg 18mpg around town it will get 25mpg on hwy trips. It's heavy even for the V6 and autotrans accounts for less MPG. Only problem was the transmission had to be replaced at 60K due to a known factory defect. This was covered by the long warranty. Only other issue now will be the cost to replace the timing belt. Important to note this vehicle was supplied to HONDA and sold as the PILOT prior to them making one. 
isuzu,rodeo,2002,randymarsh, 01/05/2011,Worth the money,4,"We bought ours in 2002 new and it has been a great car for the money. Don't expect 4runner or Pathfinder comforts in these cars, but they are much cheaper. The ride is a little stiff and the interior is cheap, but positives are a fairly peppy engine and good exterior styling. These do burn oil, but if you check it regularly and top it off as needed, you should never have any problems. At 112K miles, the only issue was the ABS light coming on a couple of times around 30K miles. Make sure they are maintained (fuel filter every 30K and the previously mentioned oil burning). Transmission fluid is sealed so a lot of places can't change it, but an Amco can handle it. "
isuzu,rodeo,2002,Ed Dennis, 06/24/2004,Bullet proof,4,"One of the tighest vehicles I have ever
experienced.  No rattles ever.
This is a true 4 wheel drive vehicle, it
is built on a truck frame and will go
anywhere.  All of the new SUV's are
compromises trying to make a vehicle
ride and handle like a car while it
looks like a 4 WD SUV.  The newer models
are really cars not trucks and if you
get them in to rough terrain they will
leave you there.  The rodeo will bring
you home and in style.  Absolutely no
problems in 18 months.  "

must say I am really happy with it.  
Aside from the poor gas mileage (city), 
I am happy I bought it.  The interior 
of the vehichle is cheaply built, but 
the power is awesome.  It is really 
dependable and affordable.  "

taking a while to do the research and 
compare between its class and I had come 
up with the final excellent decision is 
this SUV. You can't get the same SUV 
with all the standard features at this 
price. If you decide to buy one try to 
get the LSE trim, spend a little more 
but it worth it. The perfomance is 
excellent. I've try on the I-5, it came 
up to 110mph easily, no problem. Very 
comfotable drive in the leather seat. I 
love it!!!"

STAY HOME. INSTEAD WE WENT 4 WHEELING 
FOR CHRISTMAS AND MOUNTAIN CLIMBING ON 
NEW YEARS. IF IT WASN'T FOR MY RODEO WE 
WOULD HAVE BEEN SNOWED IN. I ALSO HAVE 
ROOM FOR 3 TEENAGERS,2 ADULTS, SKIIS, 
SNOW BOARDS AND CLOTHES. WHAT A 
WONDERFUL WEEKEND IN VERMONT!! 
THE INTERGRATED SUSPENSION CONTROL 
SYSTEM IS UNBELIEVABLE, THIS IS WHY I 
BOUGHT IT. IT FEELS LIKE A CAR BUT 
HANDLES ALL THE VARRIED TERRAIN.

And that was because after 5 years all tires need replacing. My Rodeo still looks and runs the same as when I bought it. I have never had a problem with this vehicle and I am very happy that I chose to buy it! It has been worth every penny. I am sorry they quit making them because I would buy another one. I will keep it forever. I might even buy a used one someday to have another one. They are so reliable, I never worry on the road that my Rodeo will break down on me or not start. I really do love it!!"
isuzu,rodeo,2002,bougt it used, 08/31/2006,So Far So Good,4,"I bought this vehicle used with 50K on it, and it feels/runs like it's brand new.  I love the exterior, and the leather interior/sunroof/all power windows, seats, etc.  Handles great, when you drive it like a truck instead of a sedan.  This is my first SUV, and I have to say I am very happy.  Gas mileage is poor, but I expected that with the purchase.  Lots of cargo room, however, people in the back seat do not have much leg room.  Sound system is great, love the 6 disc changer. No problems so far (mechanically).  V6 engine has good get up and go!  Very quiet ride, but a little bouncy...though I have found almost all SUV's I test drove to be like that.  "
isuzu,rodeo,2002,devon, 12/09/2008,Not a reliable car in the long run,2,"I bought this car used and it was great, I loved it and everything was fine... and then it hit the 60,000 mile mark. EVERYTHING fell apart on the car. Head gasket, fuel pump, transmission, EVP, everything went on the car. The same thing happened to a family member with the same model of car. If you have one, get rid of it before the mileage gets too high or you'll end up with a couple thousand dollars worth of repairs. Even following the scheduled maintenance, and regular oil changes the car doesn't hold up. "
isuzu,rodeo,2002,Remorsed, 01/14/2007,Big Mistake!,1,"Overpriced for little value. Bad resale value. Rattles and air noise is awful. Moonroof very cheap, dealer says not worth fixing. Passenger door needed fixing 3 times. Plastic parts all over the place. Car will nickel and dime you. Gas guzzler. Oh, most important, the car surges forward on its own in snowy cold weather!  Dealer can't find problem, so they blew me off, 3 times!  Very dangerous.  Can't wait to get rid of it, but I'm upside down, big time.  My daughter bought a used 2001 in 2003 and it didn't even last a year before it  dropped its engine from a broken bolt, fixed that, then it blew a gasket, threw out oil, and blew the engine.  We put in another engine just to unload it."

Rodeo! I actually went to the 
dealership dead set on the Axiom, but 
after driving the Axiom, I didn't feel 
it was very comfortable. I tried the 
Rodeo and fell in love with it! It is 
absolutely the most comfortable 
vehicle I have ever owned. I traded in 
a loaded 1999 Honda Accord and I like 
the Rodeo 10x better! It drives much 
smoother than the Honda did; it feels 
more like the ride/drive of the Toyota 
Camry. My mom owns the LEXUS SUV, and 
I actually think the ride of the Rodeo 
is more comfortable!"

spend $30K+ for an SUV when you can buy 
a Rodeo.  This is my third Isuzu.  My

I sold it.  My 1993 Rodeo has 114,000

isuzu,rodeo,2002,NY Mary, 01/23/2009,What next?,2,"I bought my 2002 Rodeo in Dec. of 2002 and I had high hopes for it as I had previously owned a 1999 Rodeo. The first one had a defect in the paint that Isuzu never took care of but the car ran great. Unfortunately, my 2002 Rodeo had what started out as an oil leak that the dealership could never find and ended with a new engine having to be put in. My warranty covered everything but the inconvenience and aggravation of bringing it back each time was too much. As for the body, every time I look at it I see new dings and defects in the paint which I've grown accustomed to. The interior is cheap plastic which you're always finding mystery bits and pieces."
isuzu,rodeo,2002,Chrome, 05/30/2002,Happy owner,4,"Never owned an Isuzu before and was 
cautious before I drove one.  Other 
than lacking in legroom (I'm 6'-3"") 
and somewhat easily scratched interior 
plastic parts the car has kicked *ss.  
I bought the 4 cyl. manual tranny 
model and 99% of the time I have more 
than enough power and torque to do 
anything that needs doing.  There's 
some windnoise at highway speeds but 
acceptable.  Seats are the most 
comfortable in any of the cars I've 
owned.  Sporty feel."

Burning oil, bad trasmission, brake replacement often, bad electronic everything, including the moonroof, the 6 CD changer and the master door panel, which we had to replace after owning the SUV for only a month.  I loved driving it for the comfort, when I COULD drive it!   Warranty doesn't cover half of this stuff!  Very comfortable and roomy though."

76,000 miles (mainly long rides on the

alternator replaced. Nothing else. But 
if you have this SUV, make sure you 
change the 4 original shocks for the 
Edelbrock hi-performer shocks. And make 
sure to verify the engine oil level 
frequently. It has been mostly reliable 
(for the price). Actually, for the 
price, it is a cute (exterior), roomy,

like the controls that take the mystery 
out of running a vehicle. Drives well 
but is a little truck-like in ride. One 
major problem that took 2 weeks to fix 
centered around the ABS system. The 
part was on factory order... The front 
seats limit the back passengers leg 
room. Power is weak so get the bigger 
engine. The front seats need to go back 
further, so if your over 6 feet tall... 
Also the steering wheel should be 
angled higher. Beautiful to look at

I can deal with a few rattles for the 
excellent reliability and warranty.  I 
do 20k miles a year and have only done

Comfort (compliant suspension)
Off road capability (4WD, limited slip)
Warranty (10 years, 120k on powertrain)
Financing (1.9% for 84 months!)

Cons-

Price / value 
Cloth upholstery (cheap fabric)
Handling

Notes-

This vehicle provides a tremendous 
amount of feature content, but at a 
price. Invoice is about $4k too high.

Steering response is probably a little 
below average for this class, but 
traction on the mud/snow tires is 
excellent.

Build quality was unexpectedly good. 
More tightly constructed than my G35.

it.  It handles great and it is a true

I loved it so much that my folks just 
bought a 2002 Rodeo LS 4wd.  You can 
not beat the warranty, features and

cleaned and the 6-Disc In dash CD is 
great.  That's where my admiration for 
this 'SUV' ends.  The suspension BITES!

I had a persistent problem with the 
slip yoke.  Isuzu knows admits its an 
engineering flaw but will not do much 
to fix it.  No recall.  

The worse thing about this beautiful 
looking car is that it drinks gas like 
no bodies business.  How about 12-16 
mph HIGHWAY for a small V6! And I may 
be giving it too much credit with those 
estimates.  My next car is going to be 
a Honda Civic or some hybrid.  That's 
what this beast has done to me.  "
isuzu,rodeo,2002,TBird, 02/13/2003,Sporty & Fun,4,"I, like most others, checked my options 
before deciding on the Rodeo.  Though I 
haven't had it long - I love it so 
far.  It is a great size for me 
(however, my husband seems a bit 
cramped when he rides or drives it.)  
My only concern is that, when parking 
on a hill, after releasing my foot from 
the brake....it doesn't sound quite 
right.  I am not sure exactly what it 
is, but it makes a groaning noise and 
rolls back a little.  Having never 
owned an SUV, maybe that is common.  I 
have thoroughly enjoyed my sporty mid-
size and would definately recommend it 
to others.  Great price (in comparison 
to others) and GREAT warranty!"

fine, despite others poor reviews of 
it.  The sliding sunrood and side tubes 
were a nice addition too.  Highly 
recommend this one!!"
isuzu,rodeo,2002,Kerrie Cornett, 02/17/2005,My Experience,4,"I love my Rodeo, but it doesn't love me.  I have had it in the shop for warranty work 7 times since I bought it on November 28, 2003.  It is going in this week for its eighth trip.  I have had sensors go bad, the catalytic converter replaced, the transmission rebuilt, the exhaust manifold replaced, and this week its getting a new fuel pump.  The clutch is tricky and there is still a knock in the rear end, but I've gotten used to that noise and learned the secrets of the clutch.  I may have just gotten a lemon, but based on the amount of time that I've spent in the service lounge I wouldn't buy another Isuzu Rodeo."

only have good things to say about it. 
4WD worked well during blizzard 
conditions in Vermont. Suspension 
control is excellent when you toggle on-
the-fly between sport and normal mode 
to adjust to road conditions (highways 
and dirt roads or potholes). Power 
button worked well in crazy North 
Jersey traffic. Length is short enough 
for getting into tight parking spots in 
NYC. One final note: if you drive SUVs 
like trucks (not like sports cars), 
they are very safe."

8500 miles on it. I've had to take it 
to the dealership for a faulty turn 
signal light which turned out to be a 
short in the wiring, the 6 disc CD 
player had to be replaced( it skipped 
whenever it felt like it).  If you like 
changing your own oil, the 4X4 V6 is 
quit challenging getting to the oil 
plug and filter. You will be removing a 
skid plate to make access to the oil 
plug drain possible. If you are looking 
for a gas saver, this ain't it. Then 
again which 4X4 really is? Don't forget 
to make sure the gas cap is all the way 
on, the check engine light will come 
on. Same for Honda Accords. "

Hills can be a challenge, but then again, I'm at max towing capacity.  Except for two nagging problems, it's been very reliable. One problem is a persisten check engine light (PO440 code, a known problem), and two failures of the accumulator piston seal on the transmission (another common problem). Both fixed under warranty.

Dealership told me they'd have to unstitch the seat to get to the problem and I'd be without a car for a week. Hood had dimples in it like someone sat on it with quarters in their back pocket. 100 miles after the warranty, the CD player broke and ruined my CDs. Parking brake never really worked. Probably caused by the dealership drove around with the parking brake on because the rear brakes needed to be replaced the first time I had them inspected. Oh yeah, 4 years into owning the car, it wouldn't shift out of 1st gear. I had an emergency repair done then the manufacturer wouldn't honor the warranty. Cost me $4k."

Replaced by dealer at 9300 miles because of ""glazing"".  One week after fix symptom returned. Truck-like ride which is more harsh than it should be (I hate torsion bars). Overpriced for what it is. Uncomfortable seats although I like the my custom Classic Soft Trim two tone/perferated leather interior ordered at delivery time. I like the extra power outlets (center console and cargo area) but they are available only with key on. 

Should'a bought a Highlander."

Acceleration at those speeds for passing is also impressive."

The drive is nice, it is not like a car, but then again, I didn't buy a lexus. The engine is quiet and drive is smooth, especially with the Intelligent Suspension Control.  I would have liked the interior to be a little more spacious, My friends who are 6 feet or taller have some space issues - also the moonroof takes away about 1-2 inches of headroom.  The looks are definitely nice, it is black with grey lowers and grey aluminum wheels.  It gets attention wherever I go."
isuzu,rodeo,2002,Brian355, 03/30/2002,My 2002 Rodeo S 4X2,4,I like the car.  I find it to be fun and igile to drive.  Great handling on wet/snowy roads for a 2WD.  It is a roomy family vehicle with plenty of cargo space.  The MPG is about what I expected.  I do disagree with reports of a noisy/busy ride.  The ride is smooth and pretty quiet in my opinion.  The light steering and tight turning radius allows easy manuvering in parking lots.
isuzu,rodeo,2002,CW, 05/06/2008,2 year owner,4,"I was overall somewhat satisfied with this car. It was easy to load and unload since the floor of the cargo area was up higher than say a minivan. It was extremely reliable, who wouldn't love that? "
isuzu,rodeo,2003,Bryan, 04/30/2010,Great SUV,4,"I bought this car new in 2003 for my wife. Having owned a 1994 Rodeo with 180,000 with no problems I knew this was the way to go and I wasn't let down. Our 03 rodeo now has 130,000 miles and still drives like new. We've performed regular oil changes and had a new timing belt installed at 70,000 miles. (not because it was giving us problems, that's just what you do at $70,000 miles) but that's it! This car has never been in the shop. This car is so inexpensive to own and maintain. You simply can't beat a rodeo!"
isuzu,rodeo,2003,Picky Driver, 08/16/2007,"Homeowner, Fisherman, Hobbyist",4,"Very dependable. Great rear bumper is a 6 inch wide rest, a shelf or a seat when tailgate is open (like no other SUV has). Also, because back window lifts up separate from the tailgate, I can carry 12 ft long pipes and lumber just extending 2 feet out the back window while it is nearly all the way down.  The seats lay down as a flat surface unlike most SUVs that leave the passenger seats at an angle when folded downward.  CONS: I notice that the paint chips at each rock dent (lacks flexibility) then quickly rusts underneath. Tires squeal in tight turns even at idle speed. What other compact SUV is built to tow over 4000 pounds? It pulls a 17' fiberglass boat easily on road or in & out of ramps. "

isuzu,rodeo,2003,Brandi, 01/16/2006,I love it!,4,"I love it. I traded my tiny Camaro in for this lovely SUV. This is actually our 2nd Rodeo to own and we love it. I like the length of the warranty. It covers just about everything that could go wrong. We had a Honda Passport and although they resemble each other they are nothing like each other. The Honda was a LEMON but our Rodeo is an Angel. The interior is nice and roomy and the seats are very comfy (we do NOT have lumbar support, you only need that if you are like 100 years old). The trunk area is large enough to hold all of our luggage for family vacations plus some and then we still have the luggage rack on top. I love the size of the vehicle because it's not small but not big."
isuzu,rodeo,2003,TicoJax, 08/30/2004,A better engine could improve a lot!,3,"I have owned this car for about 8 
months. I think 2.2 engine is not 
strong enough to handle the size of 
vehicle. Fuel is 20.5 mpg, which is 
good for a SUV. It has a noise engine 
when you accelerate. Interior is just 
average, it could be much better."
isuzu,rodeo,2003,sidless, 11/11/2005,My Twitch,3,"My girlfriend bought the Rodeo since we wanted something that would haul a pop up camper and also offered covered storage for all our stuff. 'Twitch' has been a great little ride. The Bridgestones are a bit loud, but nothing that turning up the radio won't cure. Had to replace rotors and brakes at 51K; put powerslots and ceramic pads on her and now she'll stop on a dime! The shocks wore out quickly in the rear, so I replaced F/R shocks with Bilsteins and now all is well. Good acceleration, and 22mpg average gas mileage. Seats are comfortable for short hauls but a little uncomfortable on long trips. Overall, we love our little 'Twitch'!"
isuzu,rodeo,2003,Lar, 01/16/2006,Great Car,4,"We are in our early 60's and have enjoyed the Rodeo. We owned a 1995 Rodeo, also v6 and we got at least 8-11 MPG better than the 2003 model. My mechanic says that the 2003 engine is far more difficult to service but it is fly-by-wire in that there are no linkages, all electronic. We aren't happy that the Rodeo has been taken out of production."
isuzu,rodeo,2003,skidude, 09/30/2003,"Love the Rodeo, but...",4,"I am very happy with my new Rodeo.  It 
gets a lot of use in the mountains and 
I am very happy with its off-road 
performance.  The seats are much more 
comfortable than older models we 
tested.  Roomy, sporty, attractive and 
useful.  The biggest complaint that we 
have with our Rodeo is that it is next 
to impossible to get crossbars for the 
roof rack.  The crossbars were taken 
off by the Isuzu design group due to 
noise issues, but were not offered at 
purchase and aren't offered by Isuzu as 
an upgrade or kit.  If you plan on 
using the rack, ask your dealer about 
it when you purchase your Rodeo to save 
the headache of trying to add crossbars 
later on."

isuzu,rodeo,2003,Kris Davis, 09/23/2009,Blown Engine,3,"Bought this vehicle brand new at the dealership.  I got 13-15mph from day 1, no matter how I drove it.  About 3 months ago, the low oil light came on.  I immediately pulled over, checked the level, and added 4 quarts to bring it to full.  For a 5 quart engine, to warn with only 1 quart in the engine is just a little too little.  Since that day, I checked the engine every time I started it up for the day and had the oil pan gasket replaced.  The engine started making a rapping noise on the day the oil got that low.  Since then it has gotten worse and worse.  The mechanic told me that it was just the lifters making a little noise.  Yesterday the engine seized while driving.  Not happy!"
isuzu,rodeo,2003,isuzuV64x4, 04/10/2005,Beats any high priced GM/Ford,4,"I have owned several SUVs in the past and this is the first one that did not cost me an arm and a leg to purchase or maintain. The GMC Envoy I bought for my wife ended up costing me an extra $900 6 months later when a rock hit her headlamp assembly and broke it.  The headlamp assembly alone was $900 to replace!  GM has officially priced themselves out of my market.  Cost of ownership on the Rodeo is very low.  As long as the oil is changed and manufacturers suggested maintenance is followed, this SUV will last for many years. The tailgate's sideways opening is a little awkward in tight spots, but functional nonetheless.  I could not be happier with the drive and overall operation."

From day one the vehicle has been 
emitting a rotten egg smell, the ride 
is very bouncy and bumpy. I have 
spoken to the sales reps, service 
dept, and have even taken the vehicle 
in for a diagnoses of the problems. I 
have recieved negative results in 
getting the issues fixed. Gas mileage 
is below average. I would just like a

isuzu,rodeo,2003,Me, 09/20/2005,Gas in city,3,The only operational problem I have had with this vehicle is the transmission.  It was covered under warranty since it was only three months old.  I believe since then Isuzu has corrected the transmission problems on other 2003 models.

much than that. Its nicely confortable 
front and back, it has alot of leg room 
front and back, and it has enough head 
room for both my 6 foot boys in the 
back seat. But if you decide to get a 
sunroof, there is alot less room, and 
as gas goes. Its not economical what so 
ever. If you drive more than 20,000 
miles per year, prepare to be visiting 
to gasoline station about every 2/3 
days. But other wise the rodeo is very 
stylish and roomy and seems to be very 
well built. Its very bumpy, you can

great.  It is very comfortable on the 
inside.  

Overall it is a great vehicle.  I 
looked at a lot of other SUV's and for 
the money this was the best that I 
could find.  It comes standard with a 
lot of great ammenties, that others

Very reliable, have had a couple of problems getting the starter to engage in hot weather - dealer not able to fix.  mileage is about 18.5 on hwy, could be better.  However, other traits make up for this.  Very good in snow and ice. Highly recommended."

over six months.  I have the 4 cyl.

whines a bit when accelerating.  I 
have a model that doesn't have tilt 
and although it doesn't bother me (I 
am only 5"" tall) my husband (6"" tall) 
hates it.  It rubs his leg while he 
drives.  Overall it is has been a good 
vehicle - only  had to return to 
dealer once when the latch/lock on the 
rear door broke off in a automatic car 
wash.  Gas milage is much better than 
my last SUV (Durango), I get about 18 
mile to the gal.   "

Isuzu Rodeo so far.  I drive constantly 
and the Rodeo has always pleased me and 
my fellow passengers with its roomy 
interior, cargo space, acceleration and 
smoothness.  The warranty is incredible 
and I have never experienced any 
problems with this vehicle.  I would 
definitely recommend it to anyone

Another driver hit me and I think I would have been killed if I were not in my Rodeo. So I bought another one with the insurance money. This one is newer and has the 3.5L engine, the gray trim, upgraded sound and fog lights. I love it even more than my old one. It has great pick up,  great interior. I love the controls for the stereo on the steering wheel. The price was great and it is in perfect condition. I know it will last forever too. My old one never had any problem. These vehicles are such great quality and value and low maintenance that I can't understand why Isuzu quit making them. I love mine!"

For some reason my buttons on my steering wheel don't work as well as another Rodeo that we had test drove, but oh well.  I think the exterior is definitely nice and if you throw some tires on and give it maybe a slight lift, the Isuzu Rodeo is a sick kick ride.  I have to go back and forth on an uphill road and with its 3.5 liter V6, it doesn't disappoint.  I love driving my Rodeo, although I may turn it in for a smaller car : ("

Almost,4,"I love almost everything about the 2004 Direct Injection Rodeo, except for the fuel injection problem that I have had in BOTH 2004 Rodeos I have had.  It sometimes wants to hesitate during my first acceleration of the day, but then performs fine.  I can't seem to find anyone else that has had this problem, but I have experienced it in both Rodeo's that I have had."
isuzu,rodeo,2004,columbia rodeo, 06/28/2007,Just what the doctor ordered,4,"For me, with a towing package, this is the ideal suv for the money. I don't know where you can find an equal value in today's market. To date, other than oil changes, I've only replaced the drive belt and tires. This is my 4th Isuzu since the mid 80s, I average about 120k mi/truck between purchases. With routine attention to maintenance they've all been reliable rides.  Like many others on this site I can not understand the low ratings from editors. I'd like to see Isuzu revive the Trooper and Rodeo in the US soon."
isuzu,rodeo,2004,islndgrl, 04/05/2012,Good Except For A Few Issues,3,"My overall experience with this vehicle was okay.
I bought it in 2006 at 46,000 miles.
No major problems, had its regular oil changes and tune ups. At about 76,000 plus miles i started to notice stability issues, especially on express ways, it easily tilt in the wind, i thought that it was me but was confirm with other folks driving.
At 100,000 plus miles the car making sharp left or right turns, or stopping on ramp or hills in traffic, would just shut off without warning. At 117,000 miles the car was totaled, with my son driving, he was able to walk away from it, i must say looking at the vehicle, you would not have believe that he would. The body on this vehicle is made very well...

isuzu,rodeo,2004,denmar68, 12/30/2010,Served me well despite issues...,3,"I purchased my '04 Rodeo in Oct. 2006 with 22K miles on it.
Four years later, it now has 86K on it. The only cons are the ""check engine"" light going on and off sporadically for no apparent reason, the car has problems starting maybe once a month (but it always starts), the gas mileage is not very good, and I've had to replace the battery once. I love the style of the exterior, but the interior is plain, basic and cheap looking. It has plenty of room for me and it will haul alot of stuff. My fiance does all the maintenance work on it and it's been overall, a pretty nice car."
isuzu,rodeo,2004,Ray's baby, 10/07/2004,Wonderful vehicle/fun to drive,4,"My wife and I just returned from a 
8,500 mile, 17 state road trip. We 
were looking for a midsize SUV that 
looks good and performs well. We 
noticed a lot of SUV's on the road and 
especially many Isuzu Rodeo's. On 
arrival home, we looked at and 
purchased a new 2004 Rodeo. It is a 
wonderful vehicle. My wife is 5 feet 
tall and she loves to drive it. We 
have to draw straws to determine who 
is going to have the pleasure of 
driving this vehicle. We love the 
exterior and interior of this SUV. We 
have the running boards and roof 
racks, with spoiler over the rear 
window. We have driven 3,500 miles so 
far, our MPG averages 23 long 
distance, and between 18 and 21 around 
town. We love the engine power."
isuzu,rodeo,2004,Bandit, 08/16/2010,Been Great,4,"When I bought this SUV in 2005, I was actually looking for a Nissan Xterra. But I got way more for my money with the Rodeo. It has over 100,000 miles on it now and is just been great! It has the 3.5 direct injection v6 and this has to be the most powerful in it's class. the only problem is it has always used a little oil since dat one, but if you are aware of this and keep an eye on it, it will never cause you grief. Overall,the car is great you won't be disappointed, except by maybe the gas mileage, which is to be expect on any SUV."
isuzu,rodeo,2004,gsxkid, 04/19/2009,BEST MID SIZE SUV EVER,5,"I have the 3.5 direct injected motor. It has plently of power without hurting fuel mileage. My wife drives 85 miles to and from work everyday and it gets 24 mpg. I took it down the 1/4 mile track for fun and it run a 14.88@90 mph. I have taken it camping 1 time I went off road with it; it did great, I even pulled an 07 hummer h3 out of the mud. JUST GREAT SUV."

it was great, however, I wanted to 
start with a new one.
I think it's a great vehicle, sure it 
doesn't have all the bells and whistles 
that some of the more expensive Suv's 
have, but just enough for me.
It handles well in all conditions, and 
roomy enough for 5 large people.  Of 
course..the outside design is the 
best..and in my mind is better than all 
the other Suv's in that size and price 
range.  Thanks Isuzu..great job"

occasional mid-weight towing vehicle. 
ENGINE: Got DI 3.5. Great power/mileage
& runs regular. Get almost sticker
mileage (conservative driver).
INTERIOR: Comfy sit, even on long trips.
Dash is nice looking and simple. 81cf of
space-blew away larger competitors.
Roomy back seats. Roof rack you can load
w/o having a ladder.
4x4: Works well.
INS: Cheaper to insure than most SUV's.
SAFETY: Standard anti-lock
brakes/4-wheel ventilated disk.
GENERAL: I like the sleeker look of the
Rodeo. Easy to get in and out of, baby
seat loads easy.  Glass lifts up to let
oversized items hang out. Compared/did
practical test. Great vehicle & Price."

With all the rebates, I keep my eye on new SUVs but really can't justify the expense as the equivalent value in today's market is just too steep.

The suspension could be better but I 
usually drive in stop and go traffic.

It also burns oil and I have to check the oil levels weekly. The engine light has come on, and no one can tell me what the code means! The engine also regularly sticks in first gear and the engine whines, then finally engages. I had the tranny serviced, but they tell me there is no problem. Finally, the key design completely stinks!

is plenty of front leg room and the rear seat has

its got 4wd so this thing does see a

am very satisfied with this vehicle.  
Isuzu's are low maintenance and I will 
buy a 3rd one.  Other well known  
companies use Isuzu trucks and market 
them as their own.  The Chevrolet 
Trailblazer is the Isuzu Ascender.  The 
Honda Passport is the Isuzu Rodeo.  
This should tell the sceptics something 
about the quality.    "

isuzu,rodeo,2004,Mr.Rodeo, 10/08/2004,Buy One,4,"Don't listen to the professional 
critics, take the word of somebody 
who's owned one for 3+ years. Just 
traded in the 2001 Rodeo Sport for the 
4Door model(expecting child). As 
impressed with this one as I was the 
previous model. This one seems to have 
a smoother ride than the sport though. 
The warranty speaks for the reliability 
of the vehicle. Do you really think a 
car company would place a 7/75k mile 
warranty on a vehicle that always 
needed service...Thus the reason Chevy 
n Ford only offer 3/36k. Yes we had a 
few problems w/ our 2001, but nothing 
that wasn't covered by the warranty. 
The real selling point for this vehicle 
is the price. $20,500! Loaded, this 
thing compares to a Pathfinder."
isuzu,rodeo,2004,John French, 10/09/2004,French's Review,4,"The rear Passenger doors need to open 
wider.  The seats needs more lumbar 
support and seat inclination needs 
adjustment. Mine, a 2003 Rodeo, needs a 
bigger console.  My pistol barely fits 
in the console, let alone any extra 
mags or ammo. A/C works great!  The 
suspension needs to be stiffer and 
upgraded before doing any off roading. 
Overall the Rodeo is an excellent 
product for the money. "

I pull a 25 ft travel trailer with my little truck.  I have done the brakes on it and they are heavy duty. When 110000 miles hit I had to change the radiator cause of the plastic.  I also had an engine problem with blown intake manifold gasket, again with the plastic. I also tip the rear seat down and it makes a great storage spot for items (the back has the golf clubs).  I like it so much I'm looking at the big brother the Ascender, for the towing!"

Handles great, fun in the sun when the back comes down but you feel the safety with the front being a solid roof.  Gas mileage is a downer.  Blind spots are a problem.  Needs a light near the ignition too.  Have gone off road a few times and have had a blast.  Highly recommend."

great, and it has been perfectly 


reliable for the almost three years that 


I have had it. For those debating it, I 


definitely recommend buying the V6 


engine. Changing lanes takes getting 


used to (the blind spots are 


horrendous,) and with the spare tire and 


rear-seat headrests where they are, 


reverse is worse. But those are its only 


drawbacks - keep them in mind when you 


test drive it. I've been very pleased."

No big deal and no damage incurred after driving it for a week before noticing the leak. Fun to drive. Not bad mileage, for an suv and 4wd. I've had Chevy, Ford, and Chryslers, never go back! Although a bit tight to get in the back seat, very fun to drive in the snow or the twisties on the dry. "
isuzu,rodeo-sport,2001,al2113, 08/23/2011,Thought it would be a good SUV but....,3,"I really liked it at first. The first and second gear ratios are awefull. You just cant get through them without jerking the car around. Its so cheaply built. I did have fun with it, although it was way underpowered ( I thought I was gonna die going up huge hills.) But then When i was trying to switch lane (with those horrible blind spots) it took me a little too long to make sure it was clear and I ended up REAR ENDING A CAR! THEN THE CAR CAUGHT ON FIRE INSTANTLY AND INCINERATED EVERYTHING WITHIN MINUTES AS IF SOMEONE USED A FLAMETHROWER ON IT FOR 15 MINUTES STRAIGHT. I don't even know what to think of this vehicle."
isuzu,rodeo-sport,2001,taylor, 10/14/2010,Great Truck But Check Transmission!,4,"This has been a great truck for us. The only thing about this truck is the transmission oil has no dipstick. You cannot check the fluid level or color from the under the hood, the truck has to be on a lift. So when we bought it used, about 3 months later the transmission started to jerk and we took it in to get serviced. It had about 55,000 miles on it and the mechanic told us the transmission had never been serviced and needed to be replaced. Of course he was a crook so we took it someplace else. They made repairs on it that cost around $500 so we got away pretty lucky. No problems since and it has been a great car. Just make sure to get the transmission checked out before you buy used!"

I've already had to replace

little too soon."

 did all the maintenance by myself from oil change, air filters, sparkplugs, coolant and tire rotations and everything works perfect. the gas mileage ratio is just 18miles a gal, but who cares about it if you're loving it. i'll keep this little monster the next 3 years. "

way it drives? That's how I feel about 
my Amigo/Rodeo Sport. I think the 
design is great, but definitely less 
than the sum of its parts. On paper, 
the car has impressive hardware but the 
execution is poor. The resale value is 
terrible! My 2000 Amigo depreciated 
from $22K to $12K in 20 months! The 
ride is harsh, atrocious 14 mpg city, 
rear visibility blocked by tire/rear 
seat headrests, seats are 
uncomfortable, driver legroom is tight, 
factory sound system poor, and rear end 
hops around on bumps - dangerous when 
it happens on curves. Whatever you call 
it, it's not a very good buy. I would 
not buy another Isuzu product."
isuzu,rodeo-sport,2002,Tommy, 09/20/2010,Truck based SUV,4,I have driven this for 3 years now and I absolutely love it.  In FL we have lots of summer rain storms where having a truck-based SUV comes in handy.  It accelerates like no other SUV I have ever driven (Power speed button at your finger tip).  The HP is amazing.  The removable sunroofs are the best feature.  Don't buy a girly car based SUV like a CR-V.  Buy an Isuzu Rodeo Sport.  I have driven my in laws CR-V several dozen times and it simply does not compare.  I have have done nothing but routine maint. in 3 years of ownership.

With the Jeep, as soon as the snow fell it had to go into 4WD and didn't come out until spring.  With the Isuzu I've only had to use 4WD twice and that was cause I was playing around.  I do miss the manual tranny of the jeep but that's about it.  Otherwise I've had a few minor issues.  On the way to work one day the tranny started slipping and popping.  Luckily it was only a small cracked gasket which puked out all the tranny fluid.  $180 and back on the road.  Otherwise just the driver's side window which likes to rock forward when closing."

accomidated the customer after you give 
them the check. After 50000 mi had to 
have a transmission replaced, even 
after we took it in because the tran. 
was slipping. They held my car hostage 
for 2 weeks without rental, 
compensation, or concern. It had the 
wrong spare tire cover, so we asked for 
the right one. Isuzu and the dealership 
said no. It leaks. After 60000 the 
ac/heat fan quit (out of warranty of 
course). Most of the interior plastic 
molding pieces broke or came off. After 
50000 the cd player broke (again just 
out of warranty)."
isuzu,rodeo-sport,2002,karen white, 03/27/2002,Don't Waste Your Money,2,"The 2002 Rodeo Sport is not worth the money. The 2wd is not a good one. In bad weather conditions the rear tires will spin even when the winter button is used. This button suppose to help grip the road better when first taking off.

The braking system also is not good...although it has ABS brakes. The vehicle will take off if you let up on the gas pedal without applying pressing to the accelarator."

great: it's a real rough-and-tumble 
kind of vehicle.  I'm not afraid to 
take it into the mountains for skiing 
or just to load my ocean gear and take 
it to the beach.  It drives like a 
truck, so it's not wimpy like (ahem!) 
the CRV or the Rav4: and it doesn't 
have all that froo-froo stuff found in 
luxury SUVs (i.e. Navigator or 
Landcruiser) that's catered to family

Rodeo Sport looked great and was the 
best value!
I have used my RS for long road trips

Good cargo room in the back and places for stuff in the front. It's easy to clean inside, and the outside even looks good dirty. And since it's small there's a lot more room in the garage.

Cloth seats in good condition, no wear or tears.Took back set out to make it that beach buggy, gives more space to fit 'stuff' in. This by far is he best fun SUV I have owned. I think I will regret the day I choose to move on. With 2 sunroofs, insane! No SUV ever has 2!

isuzu,trooper,2000,Patrick, 05/02/2010,"No vinegar, lots of oil!",4,"I bought mine used in WI in 07 for $8K with 75K miles, now have 140K, hoping to make it to 250K. Recently replaced starter and timing belt. Truck-like ride and capability - no snow bank or towing job is a challenge. Huge cargo area ideal for 2 dogs and frequent Home Depot trips. Well appointed: massive sun roof, 6-CD, TOD, heated review mirrors. I MUST change oil every 3K miles and only get 15 MPG. Doesn't burn oil, just drinks a lot. Top heavy. Timeless exterior styling and one small repairable rust spot on back door. Been very pleased overall - this is a ""guy's SUV"" - a beast lacking nimble handling but a reliable workhorse. Perfect for winter states, boat or ""sled"" owners.   "
isuzu,trooper,2000,Kristofer, 08/05/2008,Where Oh Where Does All The Oil Go?,3,"I bought my Trooper late in 2005 with 53K after researching for value.  Too bad I didn't check reliability as well, but hey it's Japanese!  The 3.5 six cylinder consumes copious amounts of oil... as much as a quart per week.  The EGR valve required replacing, ($1000), at 70K because of burning all that oil. Shocks were replaced ($280), two weeks ago and last night at 81K the starter failed ($670).  It handles great in the snow and carries scuba gear for 4 including 8 tanks, with room to spare.  I'm going to drive this until it falls apart as resale value is laughable."

isuzu,trooper,2000,kr in fl, 10/26/2008,"My zuzu needs work after 120k, but hey!",4,"Bought about 18 mos ago. Never thought I'd want to drive an SUV, but somehow it's NOT big and cumbersome. Everything I've read about power, cargo, visibility, handling I must support. It's great! Had an overheating problem but a new thermostat fixed it. The A/C fan does need to be beefier (mine is out now) and my trans has been failing for 6 months or so. One week it drives fine,and the next is awful- suddenly free-spinning and losing speed in traffic. I'm told there is a leak, but it's a ""closed system"", I can't check or add tranny fluid. The tranny must be REPLACED, cannot be rebuilt. I found a local shop that will do it for 1600.00. Every other owner I run into raves about their Trooper"

Not original owner, so no warranty.  Further research revealed 2 different types of 3.5 engine problems for model year 2000.  Oversized bores and not enough piston ring drain back holes.  Currently have 93,000 and am using 20w-50 synthetic to reduce the consumption rate.  Overall a good vehicle for what we paid for it.  No real issues other than oil consumption. "

The transmission went around 30,000, luckily it was under warranty so Isuzu replaced it. But to not have a car for 2 weeks was crazy. Then recently I had my check engine light come on. (49,000 miles). Took it to the dealer and it ended up being a coil that held one of my spark plugs. Replaced it and the cost was originally $410.00, I complained and got it for 318.00. I was angry but hey, I need my car. The Trooper is now driven mostly on the highway because I'm away at school. Nice to drive too.(GREAT in the SNOW!). "

over the last 3 years, torque converter 
problems, shorted wire in the 4 WD 
area, to a blown engine.  That's right, 
my engine started a loud knocking on a 
trip.  Who knows what the problem was, 
the dealership said it was out of oil, 
but I religiously change and check my 
oil.  I checked it immediately after 
the problem started and the oil level 
was fine.  Anyway, Isuzu replaced the 
engine at their expense, but I was 
without a vehicle for 10 days.  Now I 
have a rattle coming from the 4 WD area

of my warantee period.  "

94 LS that had too many things that I 
didn't need such as the headlight

luggage racks and side steps as

At about 48,000 it threw a rod so the engine was replaced under warranty though I had to fight with Isuzu over some minor charges. The new engine does not have a problem losing oil like the original.  The driver side window got stuck and cost $300 to fix. The CD changer only lasted about 3-4 years before it broke. "

a year.  It is such a great SUV. I 
looked at others like the ford 
explorer but I found that they where 
very small inside.  No leg room for 
the poeple in the back.  The Trooper 
on the other hand, is very spacy.  Its 
wonderful.  I have 20"" wheels and 8 
1/2"" tires and I have found that it

Tahoes was too rich for my blood, 
I ""settled"" for a Trooper.  For $10K 
less, including tax and tags, I 
couldn't be happier.  Although it 
weighs 1200 lbs more than my Blazer, my 
Trooper has superior pickup and its 230 
hp outruns any truck with less than 8 
cylinders.  The AC is a little under 
powered on sweltering afternoons and 
the gas mileage is pathetically poor.
Still and all, it is an excellent truck
and I'm glab I bought one."
isuzu,trooper,2000,smokeyjoeca, 01/06/2003,PERFECT FOR 33000 MILES AND STILL GOING,4,"I purchased the trooper because of its
size, the lower case transfer for 4wd,
and its value.  Sticker was $31k; got it
for $23,500.

Perfect car.  Not one single factory
repair or defect.  Other than routine
maintenance, new tires and a battery,
the car still looks brand new.

The on-the-fly 4wd, and snow handling
capabilities of this car are awesome.

The 10 year, 120,000 mile powertrain
warranty is a big plus.

I would recommend this as a used car
purchase without reservations.  It's a
bargain.  Isuzu quit making Troopers
this year. The Ascender is a re-badged
Chevy.

I give this car a hearty 9 out of ten
rating."

Trooper.  I totally recommend it.  Got 
it a year ago with 22k miles for only 
$14,600.  Can't beat the price.  Way 
more interior room, power, and size for 
the money than any other mid-size SUV.  
More rear leg room that an Expedition, 
and more head room than any mid-size 
SUV I've been in. Gets close to 20mpg 
on the highway. TOD is probably the 
best 4WD system for the snow, and you 
can even keep it engaged on dry 
pavement. My wife loves that she can 
just push the 4WD Auto button and 
forget about it.  The climate control 
is great for cold weather.  Absolutely

Engine was replaced under warranty by Isuzu. Good customer service, it just took 3 months for the engine replacement. In the interim had to buy another vehicle to fill the void. Once car was returned engine management system failed at 62K miles (not covered under warranty). Quality of build pales compared to my old '86 Trooper II. Not recommended."
isuzu,trooper,2000,MTN MBA, 11/30/2006,"100,000 trouble-free miles",4,"The Trooper continues to be a trooper! Only issue was a bad EGR @ 50k that was not covered under warranty (EGR apparently only to 24K) = $150. I've continued hard use, with the addition of towing - surprised me with 19-20 mpg in CO mountains with trailer - apparently higher highway speeds are what brings my mileage to 16-17 (75-80 here in AZ).  Installed OME 2"" lift & it rides like it should now - does not bottom-out with heavy load. Continues to excel on backcountry trails.  Interior has held-up well even though I've used like a pickup (bikes, building materials).  Exterior paint excellent with exception of chipping on rear flares near doors.  Use of K&N air filter aids pick-up. Overall build quality remains tight/quiet."

I am very impressed with the ride quality, interior comfort, standard features and interior capacity. I have towed a trailer reaching the maximum towing capacity of the vehicle 300 miles on a hot Texas day including about an hour of stop and go traffic in Dallas and had no difficulties what so ever. Off pavement driving requires more firm, other than factory shocks. 235/85R16 oversized tires fit with no modifications and no negative effects on drive quality of fuel economy.  One negative is that only one company (ARB) supports the vehicle as far as aftermarket parts are concerned. Overall I am very satisfied."

The sunroof on the 2000 is by far the biggest I've ever seen on any car. I feel much safer knowing my wife's Tropper has Torque on Demand which is a great saftey feature, especially for rainy or icey conditions, not mention... mud!  (my 96 just has the regular 4x4."

Timing belt and water pump at 100000.  Brakes at 120000.  Ball joints at 165000.  Radiator at 170000.  Other than that, just bulbs once in a while.  It does use some oil, but not a major problem.  Still cranks up and does what ever we ask of it.  We have had two people run up to us at stop lights giving their phone number if we ever want to sell it.

isuzu,trooper,2001,Troopin guy, 08/05/2006,Great SUV,5,"I bought a 2001 Isuzu Trooper Limited with 144k on it and it runs great. Its power heated mirrors come in real handy when its foggy or you want to get into tight spaces. The 4x4 is very reliable for off-roading. THE SUNROOF IS HUGE! It is very smooth and luxurious for long trips and the towing capacity is great too. Its acceleration is better then most vehicles and the winter and power drive modes are very useful. And I love the seats; they are so comfortable and good-looking. Another impressive thing about the Isuzu Trooper is its huge cargo space; it could and will swallow anything (except another TROOPER). I love this vehicle, it is the best. I test drove its successor the Isuzu Ascender and it stinks!"

The Trooper has a real truck frame, great height from the road, fantastic traction when you need it, a nice ride, and comfort. Sure I wish the mpg was better, but when I sit in new SUV's they feel shabby, more like SUV wannabes. I bought the Trooper new and I am so happy I did. I have driven it on the streets with 21 inches of snow, and it just muscles through it, up icy hills and it digs in and goes. The paint is a little worn looking, but then again so am I.  I have changed the oil every 3,000 miles. Did some transmission work at 100,000.00 and other than that just normal tune ups. I have looked at several new cars and I just can't bring myself to part with this vehicle. Buying something comparable today would cost me nearly $45,000. I only wish that Isuzu had not left the market.

isuzu,trooper,2001,aztrooper01, 11/15/2006,Best vehicle ever made,5,"I have always wanted an Isuzu Trooper for as long as I can remember.  I have looked very hard and came across a 2001 S/4WD with an automatic transmission for only $5299.  I called the dealer right away and drove down there to pick it up.  It had everything I wanted and needed.  I have driven it over a thousand miles since I bought it last week and it runs great.  Smooth acceleration, stops, ride and turns.  Not as top heavy as people say.  The only thing I have done to it was put in a sound system as the stock one didn't have a cd player or subs.  There is a slight problem with the transmission but will only cost between $400-$600 to fix.  The front pump seal is bad.  But can wait to fix it."

Had to have transmission replaced at 72000 miles (covered 100% by warranty). Also have had several issues with 4wd system which were only partially covered by warranty.

Other than that this car has had zero problems , absolutely no work other than one brake job, a few light bulbs and regular fluid changes..well over 100k now.  It really is built like tank.  I use it to haul family, lots of gear, and towing.  4WD low gear combined with high ground clearance is useful if you need it.  Not for everyone but a good off road vehicle priced very low.

compete with vehicles in its class due 
to not having the optional third seat 
or V-8 engine, it blows away all 
domestic vehicles in its class. If 
anything Isuzu should have rengineered 
the trooper and discontinued the rodeo.
I purchased the Trooper for $100 over 
the cost of the redeo and it was the 
best decision I made with cars. Who can

Most impressive thing about them is they don't rust, I live in New England MA. where we salt the roads all winter.
2nd most impressive thing about them is the minimal damage in a accident, Ask the 2014 Jeep Cherokee that hit my 2001 Trooper in the quarter panel, Jeep was totaled its engine and front wheel pushed into the cab of the Jeep thank god the people lived. My Trooper had a flat tire and dent and drove it home after we put air in the tire. After seeing accident now two police offices that responded own Troopers.

isuzu,trooper,2001,Andrew, 06/17/2008,Love my 2001 Trooper,4,"This has been a fantastic car. I use the 4WD about 10 times a year still and have not gotten stuck...even through thick beach sand, north ga back trails and 3ft of water. Pretty cool. The car has been extremely reliable and has yet to leave me stranded. My wife loves the seat warmers. I had the brakes checked every tire rotation and finally had to change the front brake pads for the first time at 105,000 miles!!!! Only complaint would be the factoy stereo and gas mileage. 16-17mpgHWY"

problem."
isuzu,trooper,2001,libralady, 06/17/2003,Great vehicle,4,"We love this Trooper. Sad they don't 
make them like this any more. We have 
the limited style that comes standard 
with a huge sun roof. Great for cargo, 
long trips, or just tooling around. The 
bad thing is the paint on the bottom 
molding scratches too easy, but that is 
our only complaint. It gets about 
16mpg, but that's sort of standard for 
SUV's. Good vehicle and in two years 
and 46k miles, not one ping of trouble!"
isuzu,trooper,2001,yellowbird, 04/02/2006,I love my Trooper,4,"I have driven across the U.S. every year in Oct. and Nov, for the last 20 years, My Trooper is the best winter driver of all the autos, pickups & SUVs I have owned. Only have 55,000 miles on this Trooper, We have other vehicles we drive when at home. We have not spent any money (except for normal maintenance, oil, tires, etc.) on this auto. Can not think of any other auto, pickup, or SUV we have owned that has given us as much driving safety or pleasure as this Trooper."

isuzu,trooper,2001,Quynn, 10/26/2009,My 2nd Trooper,3,"I've had some problems with the Transmission too and my mileage is low. The RPMs go crazy & I had problems braking. I drive a little, turn off car & restart sometimes fixes problem.  My drivers seat does NOT go all the way back. I'm 5'4"" & have short legs and seat is problem along with contour.  I had a 88 Trooper & loved it. I like this too but I wish the seats were manual & the CD player was of better quality.  Lots of room, I can put 2 bird cages, 3 cat carriers and 1-50 lbs dog & their food, in cargo area in case of hurricane evacuation.   The ""check engine"" thingie is broken. I had it reset twice. 2 weeks later, when I gassed up, the light came back on.          "

It drives and rides smoother than many cars I've owned. It hasn't developed any squeaks or rattles at all.  The engine is smooth quiet and powerful,  the transmission is equally impressive.

I immediately changed the tranny fluid, serpentine belt, all fluids, and just put new shocks. Roomy and great ground clearance. I put 10k miles since I bought it.

I had a little transmission problems after I got that fixed I ran into a small minor problem, mechanical; but after all that my truck has been driving really good. I get a little concerned with how quiet it was opposed to now it's a little loud but not too loud. So I assume that's minor as well. I love the sunroof, it shows off the black exterior and the tan interior of the truck. I look sexy in my truck. But love my truck, love it."

although a bit raspy during 
acceleration, and there is more wind 
noise than i would like.  overall, a 
solid 8/10 vehicle, and for the price 
(i bought mine used with 14K miles for 
17,250) the value is unbeatable.  sure, 
a honda pilot would be nice, but for 
twice the money i don't think so!"

Since they put a rebuilt tranny in each time the dealer said that you never know how the quality would be. Luckily I've had the warranty and will definitely get rid of the truck when it hits 120,000 miles although I would have preferred to keep it longer. I don't like the way it burns oil either."
isuzu,trooper,2002,Dan, 08/05/2010,Epitome of Pure SUV,3,"It is hard to describe the ownership experience for me with this vehicle.  I guess it can almost be described as happiness and sorrow combined.  The vehicle itself is a high quality vehicle( which I will miss when gone) which rides on shocks and rear springs (nice).  Plenty of power, big, unique, cool, and comfortable.  Problem was with Isuzu disappearing in North America.  Was assured by dealer they could continue to service when they dropped Isuzu franchise.  My transmission was serviced and failed.  Had to wait 18 days to get fixed at authorized Isuzu dealer. Second one failed again.  Replaced again at no cost.  Still love the vehicle, but Isuzu disappearing and other issues caused anguish."
isuzu,trooper,2002,Julie, 02/28/2007,Great SUV,4,"I love my Trooper - I have driven it over 60,000 miles and it has never gone into the shop.  We moved across the country 2 times - the Trooper provided for a comfortable ride, and handled mountains wonderfully.  The Trooper was large enough to fit our 2 large bloodhounds comfortably - for 2 days of driving (never heard a peep out of them).  I especially love how well I can see the road from my Trooper."
isuzu,trooper,2002,Carl Boyes, 07/02/2017,Death of the Isuzu,5,"Has been very reliable over the years. Fuel economy could be better . After 110,000 began to burn a bit of oil. Best to check it at least every 300 miles. Towing capacity is OK. Limited to speeds 55 MPH or less otherwise transmission will heat up. Was under warranty when water pump went out. Replaced starter at 130,000 miles. Other than normal maintenance which includes belts and hoses vehicle is original. Unfortunately the Isuzu became salvage after an accident in January 2018. At the time of the accident the miles attained were 198,887. The insurance company totaled it out. There is a slight possibility that it is running the streets under a salvage title.

It's been 3 and half years and it's time to move on to a new love. She always made me want drive friends to places and parties. Never let me down on muddy trails, sandy Virginia beaches or snowy Connecticut highways. Always felt safely in control.

isuzu,trooper,2002,Laszlo, 03/31/2008,This is not a good choice,2,"We needed a 4WD since we moved from Los Angeles to an area that had snow. We bought the Trooper used. It had only 32000 miles and looked very clean. It's been in the shop twice in the past 4 months and the parts are hard to get. Gas mileage was terrible before our first trip to the mechanic and now the tranmission leaks and there is no easy way to fill it. The mechanic found no dip stick. The fluid has to be pumped in under the car. They sure don't make it easy! There are so many better trucks out there, there is no reason to buy 2nd or 3rd best. The Trooper is no better than 3rd best choice for an SUV. It's uncomfortable, unreliable and get's terrible gas mileage. Stay away!"

Nothing major has ever went wrong with this car and i do run the heck out of it. Isuzu however did swap the engine for us because right at 70 thousand miles, it would consume a lot of oil and we would have to add it every 500. Known problem i have read about that problem a lot. Does great off roading ( doesn't mean you can go threw a mud pit ) but it will get you back to the trails. excellent in snow this truck goes threw a lot you wouldn't think it.

everything else out there and 
determined that the Trooper was by far 
the best value for my dollar.  The 
vehicle has a surprisingly smooth ride 
for an SUV and the controls are very 
easy to use.  The vehicle has more 
than enough cargo room and the spare 
tire is located on the rear door for 
easy reach in case of emergency.  The 
build quality is excellent but the 
technology is a little dated.  I only 
have 3,000 miles on the vehicle to

it used (14,000 mi)-it runs great, is 
roomy, sharp-looking and exactly what

While going North on I 15 and onto I 70 East, we had a good winter storm.  Lots of road ice, and at first, heavy wet snow which turned into the ""freezing"" kind.  Was not sure if I could make it over Vail summit given the 2"" to 5"" ice and pack snow and the blinding, wind driven heavy snow. Did I mention heavy snow?  Well, not only did we make it (4WD; did not spin a tire).  At one time, we slowed to just under 25 mph. due to stalled traffic (dumb drivers); even at that speed we had lots of traction which is a good thing!  On this part of the trip at 60-65 (loaded trailer) we averaged 15 mpg. Return home averaged 19.7 at 75."

No major problems. Only thing I've replaced are the battery at 50,000 and the tires at 52,500. The only thing I have to watch is the oil level as it occasionally gets low after 4-5 months.

payload, huge trunk, low trunk level
thanks to the outside mounted spare
tire, great 4WD system. 
Even the base model gives you all you
need and nothing you don't. 
Low price: I got a brand new 2001
Trooper S with 4WD for less than $22K."
isuzu,trooper,2002,Pory, 07/09/2002,Trooper Believer,4,"This is my second Trooper.  The first 
is a '94 LS.  There's not another SUV 
out there to compare feature and price 
to.  I bought my Limited with a few 
thousand miles on it for $20.5K and 
it's screamin' loaded with all the 
goodies.  It's quite solid and has 
enough oomph to get you around (more on 
that)."
isuzu,trooper,2002,JUNK, 08/19/2002,I HATE THIS SUV,1,"I have had a reoccurring problem this 
thing keeps down shifting while driving 
on the highway at highway speeds on 
level ground. The dealership hasn't 
been able to fix it after six attemps 
and the isuzu reginal rep stated there 
was nothing they could do. My family is 
terrified to ride in this thing now. 
For your own saftey buy something else."
isuzu,trooper,2002,J. D., 08/26/2002,8 yrs old,4,"I have a 1994 Trooper S. Only 
mechanical breakdown was the starter 
at 132000. Most reliable vehicle I 
have ever had. Great SUV."
isuzu,trooper,2002,littlepig, 09/10/2002,Exceeded my expectation,4,"For some unexpected reason, this 
Trooper LS is my third new SUV in less 
than three months. Previous two was 
Toyota 4Runners. Trooper is more fan to 
drive, yet not as bumpy as 4Runner. 
Interior is MUCH more spacious than 
4Runner."
isuzu,trooper,2002,Kelly26, 09/20/2002,Love this thing,4,"I've never even considered owning an 
SUV, but this thing did it...I've got 
plenty of power, more space than an 
apartment I once had, and it looks 
stunning...people are constantly asking 
me what it is, and where they can get 
one!  All this and excellent 
reliability...I'm really happy with the 
decision to buy!"
isuzu,trooper,2002,Lunatech, 10/30/2002,This is my 2nd,4,"I had a '92 and sold it at 140K-my 1st 
SUV. Before I bought my '02 I test 
drove- Trailblazer (aka the new 
Ascender), Expedition, Montero. The 
theory that the grass is always 
greener. 
I bought the Trooper because you get a 
lot for your money.
This Isuzu is made completely in Japan 
and sadly, I feel this adds to it's 
high build quality."
isuzu,trooper,2002,lamjr55, 08/11/2002,Trooper Review,4," The Trooper is fun to drive and is 
very comfortable inside. The plush 
seating and layout of the controls 
make this vehicle very easy and fun 
to operate. The ground clearance is 
great.especially in the rain and snow.
The visibility is fantastic and affords 
the driver a safe view of the road. The 
4WD button is a god send from the 
earlier 4WD operations. A truly fun 
and functional vehicle to drive."
isuzu,trooper,2002,Truxillo, 07/10/2002,Trooper; Big Bang for your Buck,4,"Our family bought a White LS 4x4. For 
our family this is not just a car, it 
truley is a recreation vehicle. We take 
far out into the mountains, deserts. My 
wife likes the heated seats, I have 
gone over logs and my CD player doesn't 
skip, and we know our two year old is 
safe in this +2 Ton vehicle (consider 
the extra $ for low gas mileage an 
insurance).

We paid $25,500.00 for our LS Trooper. 
An equivelent 4Runner would be about 
$8K more (that goes into David's 
college fund)."
isuzu,trooper,2002,John H, 01/01/2003,02 Trooper better than Edmmunds thinks,4,"So  very much interior space, I do not 
know what to do o fill it.  It is box like 
in app. but I like it the aero stuff is not 
worth it.  Only wish the diesel was 
avail here...  the six has more than 
enough power and tow my air stream 
with ease.  best value for the most 
capable on off road SUV.  Drive it love 
it."
isuzu,trooper,2002,nataanderson, 12/30/2002,best vehicle ever purchased,4,"I absolutely love everything about it!  
It is roomier than any of the other 
suv's in and some above it's class.  I 
would recommend it to anyone that is 
looking for an awesome vehicle!"
isuzu,trooper,2002,Doug K, 02/03/2003,Best Value For Your Money,4,"It's very unfortunate that Isuzu has 
discontinued the Trooper.  After 
researching Ford, Chevy and Toyota, the 
Trooper was hands down the best value 
for the money.  It has more interior 
room than ALL mid-sized SUV's, and the 
exterior has a bold, strong stature.  
The 3.5L 215HP engine has plenty of 
power, in addition, it has an 
outstanding reliability record.  From 
the drivers seat, you have a good idea 
what the road must look like from a big 
rig... It's outstanding.  They're still 
out there, if you're in the market for 
a new SUV, you still have time to get 
the best value for your money."
isuzu,trooper,2002,paul medolo, 03/03/2002,cross country,4,"we went 7100 miles in 3weeks we were
very comfortable and covered 21 states
we would recomend this vehicle to anyone!"
isuzu,trooper,2002,doug, 02/22/2008,Why don't they still make them?,4,"This is my third trooper and I will hang  on to it as long as I can.  Through almost 70,000 miles the one mechanical problem has been a $99 transmission problem, covered under warranty of course!  The moonroof is amazing and open in some form or another all the time."
isuzu,trooper,2002,D Lee, 07/11/2003,The good and bad,3,"The LS 4WD does quite well off road and 
on the highway.  It dies ride like a 
truck.  The seats are not quite as 
compfortable as I would expect for the 
price.  I have several areas where the 
paint is blistering on the front of the 
hood.  Lastly it is depreciating faster 
than I can pay it off.  "
isuzu,trooper,2002,Jimmy G., 02/25/2004,"Reliable and Durable!! ""Bullet Proof""",4,"Simply the best Vehicle I have owned 
for the last 7 Years!

This 2002 Trooper is my third and I 
will not consider purchasing any other 
Suv in it's class. I put 276.000 miles 
on my last Trooper without having to do 
anything but normal maintenance, change 
oil (every 3000 miles) and Timing belt
(every 75000 miles)and 4 set's of tires.

Simply the best Suv....Bang for Buck!"
isuzu,trooper,2002,Trooperfan, 02/25/2004,Fun With Trooper,4,"Coming from driving a car all the time 
it was a little different at first but 
I fell in love with it when Denver 
Colorado got almost four feet of snow 
in march 2002. I was one of the only 
people in the area to get out of my 
complex.  It did excellent in the snow 
and when my buddies and i go off-
roading it does incredible. I jumped it 
2 feet off the ground and went through 
tough terrain and never had any 
problems with it. It also has very good 
power for when I drive through the 
mountains. Its comfortable for myself 
and passengers when going on road 
trips. When it is windy it bucks the 
wind pretty hard and kills your gas 
mileage."
isuzu,trooper,2002,nopvntv, 03/06/2004,Sad to see it go,4,"GREAT VALUE!!! paid 20K for a brand 
new 4WD with 10 year/120,000 mile 
warantee. that is 2wd Rav4 territory, 
and this is a full frame truck with 
limited slip diff. true 4WD, and 
5000lb. tow capacity. 65k so far and 
reliability has been perfect. Has 
awsome breaks(compared to other trucks)
when towing. suspension is a little 
soft for my taste but is probably 
perfect for most drivers. Rear end 
never side steps even over bumps mid-
turn. Not sure what I will buy next 
time around since this is no longer 
avail. I will just have to wait and 
see."
isuzu,trooper,2002,Rochesterborn, 03/09/2003,Graet SUv,4,"A great SUV - It is such a great 
looking vehicle. I drive from Upstate, 
NY to Maine in the winter and this 
truck does not fail to take me home 
safely."
isuzu,trooper,2002,Joe Walsh, 12/09/2004,Best Vehicle (SUV),4,"I now have over 22,000 miles with no 
problems other than a TPS sensor 
(Throttle Valve Position Sensor) which 
I replaced myself.  I also installed 
an ""Alpine Supercharger"" with about 4lb. 
of boost which give about 50 HP at the 
tires.  I can run away from the Honda 
255 HP Pilot as I did while going over 
Donner summit, on my way to Reno, NV. 
Overall, Trooper has been just great 
for me.  Looking forward to 06 or 07 
when they, hopefully, will have a new 
Trooper for U.S. market.  Fruther, I 
have seen 22.22 MPG 56-70 MPH with the 
supercharger and a low of 15.4 while 
going over Donner summit."
isuzu,trooper,2002,arktrooper, 03/08/2002,Hardcore Trooper Fanatic!!!,4,"It has become very acceptable to ""slam"" the Trooper as old technology, too expensive, etc.

If you look closely, though, you find a DOHC 24V V6, drive-by-wire throttle, variable induction, coil-over-plug direct ignition, four-wheel discs, ABS and TOD (full time) 4WD.  

I purchased my 2000 S Auto/TOD /w/ several options for $22,309 in 9/2000. The sticker was $30,284.

While it's definately a truck, it's a very refined one and it's quicker than a 4Runner! "
isuzu,trooper,2002,Ken B, 01/13/2003,Initial Review,3,"I was a little leery of the Trooper 
because of the professional reviewer's 
claim of tremendous body roll on 
turns.  It certainly does not handle 
like a car, but it did not roll any 
more than my old Windstar (which I 
would NOT buy again).

Drive is very soft, cannot feel the 
road, which is good and bad."
isuzu,trooper,2002,STS92, 05/22/2003,Better than expected,4,"As good as the first one I bought back 
in 1984! Overall reliability of this 
vehicle has been exceptional. No 
mechanical problems at all in 24,000 
miles. Huge interior with the back 
seats down.  "
isuzu,trooper,2002,Jasiu, 03/15/2002,"Isuzu Trooper-like a rock, really",4,"Someone used the expression Storm-Trooper. Despite it's ambiguous connotation it is quite adequate. No-nonsense tough guy on wheels! Goes ANYWHERE. Smoothly covers highways and country roads. Gas mileage is certainly not great - but this is a vehicle that is ALWAYS ready to fight the elements, bad weather, and inaccessible corners. The only other vehicle ('car' or 'SUV' just does not fit the description) in this league is the Land Rover, but it is made in Britain..."

isuzu,trooper,2002,CT Road warrior, 04/25/2019,A fantastic land yacht,5,"I bought my new 1994 Trooper from a dealer near Cape Cod when I lived in Connecticut. Once I replaced the Bridgestone tires with Pirelli Scorpions, my winter driving was greatly improved. I rightfully believed I could go virtually anywhere in that truck. The only problem I had was in 1998 when I relocated back to Los Angeles. A small oil leak had left little puddles on the driveway so, I took the truck to a Ford/Isuzu dealer in Encino and was told they had to replace the valve cover gaskets. Then they me charged $1500 to replace $20 worth of valve cover gaskets. I was furious. But I negotiated the invoice down to $900. Still felt robbed by a Ford dealer. Maybe they thought I would trade for an Explorer. 
So, despite how much I had loved that truck with the comfortable interior, cargo space the size of a barn, great handling, decent styling and over 100,000 trouble-free miles, I traded it for a Honda Accord, a fine car indeed. But I loved my Isuzu. I drove it from Connecticut to Los Angeles without any problems. A great ride. But the lack of available service in Southern California, and the feeling of being taken hostage by a Ford dealer falsely promising excellent Izusu service forced me to make the trade. That won't put an end to fond memories of that Trooper. We made it through a few very tough New England winters and a 3200 mile road trip without breaking a sweat. Great truck.

isuzu,vehicross,2000,AStewart, 08/07/2009,"Fun Car, Timless Style",4,"It is one of those like it or hate it kind of cars, I wanted this car the first time that I saw it. The style attracted me to it and after driving it I was hooked.  The SUV or PUV ""Performance utility vehicle"" (as some call it) is a blast to drive!  Plenty of power and sports car like handing  makes it hard to believe it is an SUV. The all wheel full time drive is awesome on wet or snowy roads and the Recaro seats are very nice when sporting around corners."
isuzu,vehicross,2000,Delta D, 07/21/2008,What You Want?,4,"In your face fashion statement for some - but underneath its heart is covered in mud. I'm from Africa and worked as Expedition Guide for several years. We travel Africa's worst roads year round - from Cape Town (southern tip of Africa) all the way up as far as Egypt, through the deserts and jungles (which makes the Darienne Gap look like a normal workday in the rainy season). Isuzu together with Toyota are the KINGS for durability and reliability (it does not matter WHAT Landrover's spin doctors say). Drove it 2300 miles in 48 hours once - was a pleasure even on the blacktop. The Vehicross is like a (stubby) pig in mud out there - it is a pity to see it in captivity and out of production."
isuzu,vehicross,2000,Unique2C, 08/09/2004,Truth,3,"The Vehicross needs help in the 4 wheel

on-road. Off road, it has been great."
isuzu,vehicross,2000,myvx, 07/03/2007,Long Time Owner and Enthusiast,4,"I have owned and driven my Proton Yellow VX for almost 7 yrs. The name Vehicross is synonymous with what the name stands for which is a cross between a car, truck and a rocket. As soon as I got my new VX home I changed all lubes to AMSOIL synthetics. I then left my home in Phoenix, AZ and went to Southern OR. I took a paved road short cut around Reno, NV. The pavement ran out after 15 miles and the rest was a wide dirt/gravel road for the remaining 100 miles. The road twisted and turned through the desert and when I exited the road's end I realized that it had only taken 75 minutes to go 115 miles! Fun and fast little rocket! After 7 yrs people still ask ""What is it?"""

I bought it with 74000 miles and I've driven about 5500 miles, enjoying every one of them. It can be high maintenance, only because it is very rare and some parts are hard to find. But the main components mirror the Trooper lineup. The outward appearance in unique and current to today's new model SUVs.  It's funny that all of the new models coming out today by other manufacturers have taken the a lot of the V-Cross stylelines and Isuzu came out with this in 1993. Someone had a crystal ball into future SUVs of the 21st century. In addition to owning a unique vehicle, I enjoy the camaraderie with fellow owners."

isuzu,vehicross,2001,everettr, 03/13/2002,"Major fun, but no navigation system",3,"The Vehicross has cool, futuristic styling; lots of power, and good torque. But, GPS is not an option (a good nav system is a must if you live in the city). And, it has U-Haul like rear visibility."
isuzu,vehicross,2001,Scott Free, 04/27/2007,Can't get much better,4,"Purchased my VX in early 2002 and have been in love ever since.  It handles more like a sports car than an SUV.  In the snow it is a beast, never got stuck one time.  Drove it on the beach in NC and all I got was turning heads.  Put simply, it is like owning an exotic car.  Only 5000 were ever produced, so you almost NEVER see another one, wherever you go, not like so many other mass production vehicles (1 every 3 blocks!).  The stiff ride allows you to feel the road, and corner without yaw.  Good luck getting a used one, because I will probably NEVER sell mine. :)   Simply the best experience I have ever had with a vehicle."

the VX is it! This is the first time I
have owned or even seen a 4X4 that you
can buy and go right to off road
IMMEDIATELY! All other 4x4s including
jeeps have got anywhere from $3000 and
up before they are really off road
ready. The jeep wranglers for example
lean so much in a turn they feel like
they will roll right over and they will.
However the VX can hit a corner with
hardly a hesitation and while in the
corner you can just nail it and it will
just hook up and launch you straight
down the road. Also a VX has the
articulation that other 4x4s just dream
they came off the assembly line with. "

you can find new one for 23-25k, and at 
that price a real steal. A truly unique 
SUV, capable off-road and comfortable 
on pavement, with real head-turning 
ability. If you're looking for an SUV

handling is great on road as well as 
off. In town, I have learned to realy 
on my side mirrors more than the center 
rear view because of the lower 
visibilty. I did instal an aftermarket 
air filter by Calmini which increased 
the power and gas mileage and would 
advise anyone else to add it on. The

quiet, fast and stable.  People stop 
you in parking lots to find out what it 
is.  The fact that there were only 
4,153 imported into the U.S. makes it 
even better from my perspective.  I 
plan on keeping it forever.  It is too 
cool and rare to sell in my opinion.  
My pet peeve with it is that there are 
no cup holders ... ok, I can live 
without them.  That is my only

I thought about buying and lifting an Audi Allroad or Subaru Outback.  And then I trolled AutoTrader and remembered the ISUZU VehiCROSS.  The perfect combination of both my former vehicles.  After driving the VehiCROSS it was so awesome that I bought a second VehiCROSS with 190,000 miles on it.  Both drive awesome and have no issues.  Get one or two while they are still off of everyone’s radar.  These are like lifted old Porsche 993’s.  Hand-built, rugged, comfortable, obscure. The best SHTF vehicles you could own!

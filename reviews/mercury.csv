mercury,cougar,2000,david689, 01/26/2015,"Great, Reliable, Affordable",4,"I drive my Cougar every day, 60 miles each way almost with no problems. Gets pretty good mpg. Sporty and safe, the Cougar is the best of both worlds. Not too roomy inside but that's expected. "
mercury,cougar,2000,ms__brown, 08/22/2012,"Like other reviewers, loved this car...at first...",2,"I bought my Coug in 2004 with 50,000 miles on it.
I've had minimal mechanical ""failures"" but many mechanical problems.

The headlights dim a lot and if I have the wipers, headlights and stereo on at the same time, it dies.
Sunroof never worked.
The car won't start for an hour after it's been running in more than 90 degree heat, but the thing ALWAYS starts in the winter, even if it's 70 below (bought in ND and never used a block heater).
It now has 116,000 miles (I don't drive a lot) and it needs a new suspension, shocks, struts, etc. I recently replaced the front tie rod so I wouldn't die.
Shaky after 65 mph.
 
Not kid friendly.
 No hooks for child seat in the back, so trading."
mercury,cougar,2000,tcmommy, 01/28/2012,Dont be fooled..,3,"I bought this car used as my very first car. It had 55k miles on it and I loved it at first. It now has 153k miles and I dont even feel safe driving it. At about 70k miles I had already gone through 1 alternator and 2 batteries. The car started shaking really bad and I needed to replace entire transmission. All in all, I've had to replace, many tires (more than usual), 4 alternators, 2..yes 2 transmissions, transmission and engine mounts, many batteries, the trunk no longer stays open on its own, check engine light will not go off, even though dealers have checked numerous times, lights have a film over them, and power window motor twice. It looks nice, breaks great, but just not worth it. "
mercury,cougar,2000,Liz, 02/24/2009,Wonderful Car,4,"I just bought my Cougar last January, and I love it. It drives and handles great. I also learned that on long trips the gas mileage isn't as bad as you would think. I have drove it from North Carolina to Nevada with no problems. Now I am about to drive it from Nevada to Washington and so far the car seems like it has no problems this time, even after not being drove for 7 months. I just wish that the cup holders in the front were better. Besides that its a great car."
mercury,cougar,2000,Mike, 11/20/2006,Great Car,4,"I got this car in apr 03 from an auction for 3k. well it had 97k miles on it then and it has 143k now and i've never had anything replaced. i did notice the hatch on the back likes to stick and the cup holder doesn't fit larger cups.. doesn't seem like that is worth complaining about tho. i think it is the ""sports package"" edition since it has everything on it i.e. moonroof, leather, electric seats, spoiler etc. i have traveled from Richmond to Miami and last summer stayed in Syracuse NY and drove down to Richmond VA just about every weekend for 3 months (yes a 7 hour drive!) and the car has never broken down or any problem what so ever! maybe i just got really lucky.."
mercury,cougar,2000,Jackson Burfitt, 12/29/2016,LENGTHY BUT INFORMATIVE,5,"I have had this car for 2 years as of now it has 102,911 miles on it when I first got the car it had about 60,000 miles on it. So I've driven the hell out of this car, 2 months after I got the car I had to change the alternator a couple times in a row no biggie my mechanic has a 1 year warranty, so I only had to pay for one. I've had the same alternator for 2 years no problems what usually happens is that the wiring or the regulator goes out. As for ""unsporty"" acceleration blame that on the stock air box/filter and the CD4E transmission (if you have auto the manual is way better if you know your optimal shift points.) I have put a K&N cold air intake performance spark plugs/wires and reflashed my PCM. And I'm still not done with her yet and she already pulls 10 times better than when she was stock (maybe a hyperbole ;) a little.) The body is still stock and I always get compliments people think it's a Jaguar sometimes. The car handles fantastic because of it's wide wheel base and touring multi link independent suspension agile like the cat it's named after. Interior looks a bit cheap but there are ways to fix that. Steering is a bit heavier than other cars but it's because of the Euro steering styling which I'd prefer over any other because I can ""feel the road"" so to speak, and since it is FWD you will feel torque steer (better around turns.) I've had a lot of close calls with accidents because of idiots on the road. It is definitely a car that you can drive and have fun as long as you take care of and it will take care of you!!

"
mercury,cougar,2000,Anonymous, 12/07/2010,I love this car!,5,"I bought my Cougar new in 2000 and now am approaching 120,000 miles.  It has been the most reliable car I've ever had.  Only normal maintenance until last year when I had a repair bill for $700.  However, one bill in 10 years I'll take any day.  This car is fun to drive, sporty, fast, yet tons of cargo space if you need it (fold-down hatchback).  I average 24 mpg city/30 highway, which is better than many new cars.  I've been trying to convince myself to trade it for a new car, but I just can't find one that matches up (considering it'll mean a car payment again + having to cross my fingers I get another good car).  I may give it to my nephew (and that tells you how much I trust this car)"
mercury,cougar,2000,FREDDY COUGAR, 11/06/2008,A great car!,4,"After reading some of the troubles other people had with their Cougar, I must have got all the good parts. My 2000 Cougar SE had only 25 miles on it and came with the five speed. For the next 6 years and 120,000 miles not a thing went wrong aside from the tires and brakes being replaced 3x. Then the alternator went and a few months later the original battery died. I consider that normal wear. For 2008 I've done a the front brakes and my 4th set of tires and have 145,000 miles on it. I give the car a good detailing every spring inside and out and she still looks new. I'll keep her as long as nothing major goes wrong with the engine or the tranmission. Good luck to the other owners."
mercury,cougar,2000,angel42497, 03/19/2014,Mercury Cougar,3,"I currently have this car, and all the other complaints about this car above are absolutely true. It is a complete gas hog, it has ALOT of mechanical issues, my interior sucks, headlights are horrible. My car has 134k miles on and is expected for problems, but too much. My Engines motor mount is bad, which causes my car to buck leaving me wonder if it will start for me. Hot weather it is TERRIBLE in, after it gets to about 80+ degrees it wont start. I have never had a problem with the cold though it has been negatives many times. It's fuel injector is going out, transmission is bad, and the RPMs get ridiculous. It sputters whenever you hit the gas lightly. Over all it isn't a good first car."
mercury,cougar,2000,Scuba Steve, 04/04/2002,"good looks, good drive",4,"I got my Cougar a little over a year 
ago, and have had 0 problems to date.  
Its by far the most fun car I have ever 
driven, with a gutsy enough little 4 
cylinder and the easiest shifting 
manual transmission that I have ever 
seen.  The car handles like a dream 
around corners.  The 1999 Cougar had 
problems, with few to none of them 
transferring over to the 2000 model 
year.  If you would like a car that 
runs good and looks great, grab one of 
these."
mercury,cougar,2000,Zach, 08/11/2008,So-so car,4,This was a very nice car. The first day we bought it off the lot we got ours brand new and haven't had too many problems with it. Only a few things here and there. Car has a sleek design and it is fun to show off and just go for a cruise. The gas mileage is a little low but better than some of the new cars today. It was a great buy and soon it will be my sons car!
mercury,cougar,2000,Cougarchick, 06/18/2002,my car,4,"i love my cougar.  it's never let me 
down.  handles well in the snowy 
minnesota winters."
mercury,cougar,2000,Pebbles073, 06/19/2002,2000 Mercury Cougar,4,"I've had my Cougar for almost 2 years 
now and I LOVE it!!  Never had a 
problem.  The car is stylish (turns 
alot of heads) and very quick.  My 
lease is over 9/03 and I will be sad to 
see it go, it's definitely been my 
favorite lease so far."
mercury,cougar,2000,Jamie, 11/04/2015,Problems from the start,3,"I got it as a present from my father before i even had my licence. Mind you he didn't let me pick out the car i wanted or even asked me what I liked in a car. I hate two door cars but i was happy because it was a car..  As soon as I got the car I had to replace the alternator. Then after 2 months of driving it the car starts to jerk every time I drive it so I replace the fuel pump. That does not fix it so it must be the transmission that i have to fix. For all of that i can just buy a new car. There is a lot of recalls on this car
"
mercury,cougar,2000,Danny Reyez-Macias, 03/02/2016,FOR THE LOVE OF GOD NO,2,"I had this for 2 years and it had 83k miles on it when I first had it... But boy oh boy, can the murderous ones look enticing.
Pros-
It had alright front seats
The CD player was great.
The sound system was awesome
It's really sporty.
Cons-
It rusts easily (Muffler fell off after a month of heavy rain after I hit a pothole)
There were many electronic issues. (3 batteries, 1 alternator, 4 tune ups within 2 years)
Sensor failures almost killed me twice.
After 6 months, the boot arms started wearing out.

Overall: It's a sporty death trap. Don't buy it.

mercury,cougar,2000,kristan85, 01/30/2011,Hunk of Junk !!,2,"I've had my Cougar about 4 years now and it's only just over 89,000 miles. I've had to have 3 fuel flushes ..the gas was filthy and very dark brown and causing the engine to miss. I've had to put 2 new batteries in it along with an altenator. I had plugged ECG valves. Last week I spent $700. on a new fuel pump along with a fuel/oil pressure censor. I've replaced all 4 tires. The dash lights and headlights are always flickering. It won't start if it's cold out. My sunroof won't open. It's starting to rust. The battery light is always flickering on and off (even with a new battery and altenator). When it's cold out my trunk won't stay open I have to hold it up (hatchback)..do not recommend!!!"
mercury,cougar,2000,tjl, 08/13/2008,Fun car,4,"I just bought my 2000 Cougar V6 with every option it could possibly have. It had some of the problems I read about in these reviews like stalling and the electrical but I brought it to a Mercury dealership 7 times till they got it right. They replaced the fuel pump, egr valve several vaccum lines. Every once in a while the engine light comes back on and it's just a vaccum line came off the egr valve. Just put it back on and the light turns off after a cycle or 2. It's been running great since I just put a Cougar banner across the windshield and an aem ram air intake. It gave the car a mean growl to it. Now I'm just waiting for my new exhaust.."
mercury,cougar,2000,12 paws, 01/03/2010,Smooth & sweet,4," I've had this car since 2005. I'm very happy with this ride. Traded a Buick Riveria (very sweet) in to get this Cougar. She's got the looks and power. Ready for new struts now,comfort is a must!!!"
mercury,cougar,2000,No Thanks, 08/29/2010,Just Say NO,3,"Cougars are really beautiful cars. BUT don't let looks fool you! Mechanically, this car is awful. The interior & exterior lights would flicker horribly. At night, I could barely see. & eventually, it got to the point where I wouldn't even drive the car at night. I would feel the car begin to sputter & shake whenever I drove uphill. I tried to help these problems but after 4 alternators, a complete rewiring, new struts & a new rear axle: I traded it in! It was so disheartening to think that I had such a hot car but I didn't feel safe in it. I hated driving it so much that in the 4 years I had the car, I only put 20,000 miles on it. I would not recommend a Cougar to anyone. "
mercury,cougar,2000,unsatisfied, 04/03/2002,Don't buy one,3,"The Mercury Cougar is number 5 on the ""lemon list"" put out by the government.  I have had mine in (that has less than 30000 miles on it and is still under warranty) 4 times in the last three months!  The have replaced the ""brain"" to the transmission, fuel pump, etc.  2002 is the last year they are making them because they have so many problems."
mercury,cougar,2000,What a Lemon, 10/05/2008,What a Lemon,3,"I would not suggest anyone to buy this car. I fell in love with this car when I first seen it but in this case looks were not everything. I bought this car as a birthday present to myself and since driving it off the lot a year ago I have already spent $4000 in repairs. It is sitting at the garage right now waiting for another transmission. I have had it in the garage twice before with the same issues. Other than the trans my AC stopped working this past summer, the fan at the radiator stopped working, the headlights do this dimming thing that just drives me crazy, but hey, it has a great radio. It's seen the back of a tow truck more than the road itself. "
mercury,cougar,2000,beau66, 05/06/2002,unreliable,3,"Although this car looks good and has 
some of the best features for the 
price, it is unreliable.  I've had the 
cougar for almost 2 years now, and I 
have put over a 1000 miles on it just 
from taking it to the shop to get 
repaired. It has had problems since 
day one.  Ford customer service is a 
joke.  They won't do anything to help 
me get out of this vehicle, they do fix 
the problems that occur, but when all 
you have is problems something 
else needs to be done.   Sure the 
repairs are warranted, but, its not 
worth having a new vehicle if you 
can't count on it."
mercury,cougar,2000,Joshua, 12/21/2008,Worst Car I've Ever Ridden In my life.,3,This vehicle Is not reliable. I just recently wrecked my wougar going 45 and ran straight into a electrical pole. The airbags did not deploy and the seatbelt did not lock in place for the passengers in the backseat. The Cougar is not a good vehicle for a first time driver. Do not buy this car for your teenage daughter or son. It crushes like a can. I put a dent on my front right fender by just leaning on it. It broke down many times for multiple reasons. 
mercury,cougar,2000,Ashley, 03/14/2009,Not a reliable car.. i hate my cougar,2,"I bought this car about two years ago after having a friend total my vw jetta which i loved.  the cougar is nothing compared to that car and i can say i have had more problems with my cougar than i ever had with my jetta.  within the first few months of having my car i liked it, it was nothing special but after like four months i started to have major problems with it. since i have spent probably close to $6000 fixing it.  replaced the transmittion, any and every sensor possible, the alternator is bad now and i have had probably 5 batteries all go bad.  the car stalls when it gets cold out or rainy.  it is a very unpredictable car and i would not recommend it to anyone... wish i never got it"
mercury,cougar,2000,carlos, 03/20/2009,cougar,4,"i love my cat is a really good car, i had some problem like the alternator but is really good i nerver have problem about the gas i drive my car with 0 of gas an nerver stop is a great car "
mercury,cougar,2000,Cougar owner, 05/25/2002,Oh my Kitty,4,"I purchased my Cougar in April 2000. 
Most problems related to service but I 
did take the car back about 4 times the 
first two weeks for radio problems. A 
few months afterward, I took it back 
because of bubbles that caused paint 
chips. The car has had several recalls 
that I knew nothing about until a year 
later. The most recent problem was the 
RPM revs in neutral. Passengers are not 
crazy about the back seat, so this car 
is for the selfish...few riders and no 
little kids! The car seat does not fit 
properly in the back. I like the looks, 
but I am not completely satisfied. I 
won't be buying another 
Cougar...neither will I buy another 
Mercury."
mercury,cougar,2000,Nkb310, 05/15/2009,too many problems,4,"the second day i braught it home, it has trouble starting, i got new battery, new starter, and it still wont start properly..its not reliable...i dont want to be stranded, a week after having it i had to get 2 new altenators put in...and it howls wich i dont like...i have had nothing but problems since the say i baught it which is too bad becuase i love everyhting else about it, i love the driving, the stereo, the appearance, and even the annoying cup holder... "
mercury,cougar,2000,ok...., 05/28/2009,ok.......,2,"i really liked this car when i saw it on the lot, but now i hate it. Its got a lot of problems and i would not recommend it to anyone else. It shakes in between 60-70 mph The check engine light turns on and off. Its horrible on gas i get maybe 18 mpg The windshield wipers are horrible I hate this car I'm gonna buy a jetta!"
mercury,cougar,2000,Shawn M, 06/05/2002,Beauty is only skin deep,2,"This car looks great and handles great. 
It lacks power and acceleration 
especially with the auto trans. The gas 
mileage is horrible at about 14.2mpg in 
the city. I've had various mechanical 
problems including fuel pump, brake 
pads wearing out every 12k miles, 
faulty tires and more. The service is 
terrible and takes FOREVER. I would not 
recommend the 2000 Cougar to anyone 
unless all you want is to look good."
mercury,cougar,2000,Horrible Vehicle, 07/06/2009,Piece of Junk,1,"My wife purchased this car new for around 30,000 Canadian and it has been nothing but trouble, broken master cylinder causing brake failure while driving, intake manifold carboning up, broken brake calipers, premature brake wear (every 50,000 km), sun roof failure, fuel pump failure, poor suspension (shock failure 80,000 km), check engine light comes on constantly, maintenance light on since new and dealer cannot clear, the car is worth nothing now. Do not purchase this car! "
mercury,cougar,2000,Wanda, 07/10/2009,I wouldnt buy,2,"I have had to replace 3 alternators, has to get tires replaced a lot.  I have to get my transmission electrial system replaced.  I had to get wiring for from my engine to my alternator.  My set does move up it stays in one place.  My trunk, will not open on its own.  Recommendation, is to check out every's car reviews before purchasing this vechile."
mercury,cougar,2000,brittlya, 07/30/2009,I hate this car!,1,I truly hate this car! I am always having some type of problem with this car! Every year since I have had it there has been something that breaks down on it! Its truly ridiculous! I would not recommend this car to ANYONE!! Its the biggest waste of money thats ever been spent!
mercury,cougar,2000,Tlover, 08/18/2009,Loved it!,4,Well this car was given to me by my parents as my first car.  It was a great first car!  Very sporty and got alot of attention.  The only problem I ended up having with it was the sunroof broke and was going to cost a fortune to replace!  Next problem...I don't drive it anymore is that I was rear ended at 50mph which in turn made me slam into the car in front of me.  The car was absolutely crushed like a little can and guess what...no airbag deployment.    Don't crash and the car is great!
mercury,cougar,2000,Cougar Lover & Loser, 12/27/2009,Looks Good but Buyer Beware!!,4,"I have had my Cougar for going on 4 years now. It had 69k when I bought it & I just took it over the 87k mark last week. Let me start off by saying that I love the looks of this car, especially with all the bells & whistles (like leather seats, moonroof, and traction control) BUT the looks alone are not worth the hassle the Cougar brings. I have replaced the alternator ($700/ea) three times! IN LESS THAN 18,OOO MILES! Today, I noticed the same old flickering lights & I headed off to trade her in for a Rav4! "
mercury,cougar,2000,hitmore35, 06/19/2002,Not very pleased,3,"I've had my Cougar for 2 years, and 
it's been in the shop for MAJOR issues 
about 10 times.  3 times for the fuel 
pump (twice replaced), 2 recalls, 
Transmission slips, brakes, leaks of 
all sorts, electrical failures,  and 
the list goes on...
It's a shame because the car itself it 
very nice looking, but it's TOTALLY not 
worth the trouble.   I'm looking 
forward to moving on to a different car 
soon."
mercury,cougar,2000,dom, 03/20/2010,fun but some problems,4,Car is ok to drive but some minor problems have come up 1. Sun roof broke and some times leaks from rain 2. Driver side window doesn't always go up 3. Alternator die a year ago. 4. The counter for how many miles you have left is way off its died twice on me when it said it had 23 miles left  its ok but I would Rather have a Ford mustang and I will be selling this car
mercury,cougar,2000,jessii0825, 04/02/2010,jessii,2,"I bought this car from private seller after owning one before and loved it. Since I have this car I have put more money in than its worth. Had transmission replace, starter, gear cable and now something seriously wrong with engine (timing and wheel something) which will costs another 2300 to fix. I said forget it and I'm selling for parts (of course I don't know who would want these crappy parts). I would never recommend buying this car. Its junk!"
mercury,cougar,2000,Zoey, 08/03/2010,Been good to me,4,"I bought the car new, it was cute and got great gas mileage.  I have the 5 speed transmission.  Everything held up great.  I took good care of my care and can recommend it as a used vehicle if you are looking for good gas mileage and nice sound system.   I didn't have any of the negative experiences mentioned by other owners. The tires went to 78K original, the tire tools clunk around, but you can fix that.  Great sound system.  Not a speed demon, but got me to where I wanted to go and didn't cost me much after the purchase price.  "
mercury,cougar,2000,JosieListens, 09/12/2010,Heaven to Hell,4,"I got this car as my first car. It was bought with busted valve gasket (easily fixed, cheap). Beautiful car!

Engine light has always been on. NOW, master cylinder blew. I loved this car in the beginning. Super fun, with 5 speed transmission, super quick. BUT, it JUST SITS more than i drive it.

mercury,cougar,2000,cougarman, 08/19/2002,I like it...,4,"I purchased my cougar in November of 
1999.  I love it.  I make sure it has 
it's scheduled maintenance, and in 
return, it purrs like a, well...cougar.

After 3 years, I just replaced the 
tires and brakes.  That's it. No other 
problems.  There were a few minor 
recalls for items like a battery cable 
not connected correctly, but the 
service I receive from my dealer gets 
me in and out quickly.

I have a 5 spd which performs well in 
merging situations and pulling out into 
traffic.  The interior is really 
constructed for not more than 2 people, 
but the bucket seats make for a 
comfortable ride."

my 4th alternator, and why my car won't 
start 90% of the time. When I picked up 
my car in January of 2001, Reverse 
didn't work and it got a transmission 
overhaul at with 16 Km on the car.  My 
rear bumper doesn't fit properly either."

some have had with this car.  My 
husband and I have had no problems.  
We've driven it coast to coast and 
haven't had to take it in for anything 
except for oil changes.  It is a fun 
car to drive and the hatchback with 
folding seats gives us plenty of 
storage room.  We've hauled furniture 
and had friends borrow it to haul 
things that wouldn't fit in their 
cars.  We're sad to be selling it, but 
the bucket seats in the back aren't the 
best to put a car seat in."

mercury,cougar,2000,Rocketman53, 12/02/2002,Nice Kitty,4,"For you Fast and Furious types, the 2000 Cougar is a much better car than 
most reviews lead one to think.  Yeah, the steering feels a bit heavy, but it's 
a subjective observation.  I don't find it objectionable.  The power of the 2.5L 
V-6 is more than adequate, 145 mph top end, while the four wheel disc ABS 
brakes strong enough to stop you in a hurry.  The interior is sleek, and all 
business.  The New Edge look makes the Cougar a real chick magnet.  Ford 
blew it when they discontinued the model line.  The prices are a bargain 
compared to other similar vehicles."

clueless.  Now that the little stuff 
has been taken care of, it's not bad. 
Fairly comfortable on a trip, although 
the sport suspension (an option) is a 
little rough on bad roads.  The 170HP

equally sporty engine. I've heard that 
the Cougar has acceleration problems. I 
guarantee you that everyone who says 
that drives an automatic. I have the I4

the cougar. The acceleration is great, 
better then my 2000 VW GLX with the 
VR6. The VW has a hesitation when you 
give it gas before the power kicks in. 
The cougar responds quicker. I was 
supprised to see all the poor 
reviews,as I really like this car, so 
far. The only problem I've noticed so 
far is when the ac is on the engine 
cuts out on power when driving at a 
constant speed. Like a power surge, 
but in reverse. This is a little 
annoying. I only wish it had a moon 
roof like the passport and jetta. "

with me because I don't like driving 
everyone around anyways. I've had a 
few problems with the car, but nothing

almost 1k."

Cougar's responsiveness and 
reliability.  It is a fun car to drive, 
having sleek, sporty lines and a unique 
taillight configuration.  It is average 
in gas consumption: I get about 18 mpg 
in city driving, and 24 mpg highway.  
Nice features are the electronic gas 
consumption indicator, the MPG 
indicator and outdoor temperature 
reader.  60/40 fold down seats are a 
real plus.  Biggest complaints are the 
somewhat cramped interior and the 2-
door hatchback visibility. I also think 
the suspension can be improved."

the exception of having to take it to 
the dealership to replace a fuse for 
the left turn signal.  The 
acceleration, braking and handling make 
this car fun to drive.  Easily gets up 
to 100 MPH.  Fuel economy could be 
better as could the front drink 
holder.  Reading the reviews made me 
laugh as I thought of using two hands 
to grab a drink larger than 20oz.  One 
hand to pull the drink out, the other 
hand to keep the plastic in the center 
console!  You people know what I'm

There are too many problems to list 
here.  This car has been in the shop

week and 2 different dealers who 
couldnt fix the problem and told me 
the car was possessed and I should 
sell it immediately! So then I took it

every time I pick it up from the 
dealer it goes out before I am out of 
town. The headlights dim, when you run 
the A/C and the headlights you might 
as well forget about power and being 
able to see. I also agree with the 
tire situation they are expensive

I average 25 mpg with a v6 and an

city and highway driving.
It is an oddball tire size, so they 
can be expensive, but I went one size 
up to a common size and they were 
cheap.  It didn't change the ride or 
speedometer to where I'd notice.
Overall if I had the initial buying

*  Backseats are too small for adults.
*  Dim Headlights are too dim.
*  No compartments for change & stuff.

Positives:
*  Tons of trunk room
*  V6 is fast & fun.
*  Mercury covered the cost of the 
fuel pump recall.

I have had the car into get serviced 
many times.  The fuel pump has been 
replaced twice.  No one seems to know 
what is wrong with it.  After the 
redesigned pump was put it, I figured 
my problems are over.  I still have a

Major issue is the engine build.  Your engine light goes on for unknown reasons and after fixed comes right back on.  I've replaces the alternator once and now have had trouble with the starter and the fly-wheel.  So my engine sometimes doesn't start.  Labor on these cars is outragious due to the unaccessability to fix what should be simple things.  No other major problems accept the trunk won't unlatch with just pushing the button in your car - you have to use the keyless entry and be sure you double click that button withing 6 inches.  "

It started with a bad alternator, one month and three alternators later, we traded the car in at a significant loss. No one could fix it, not even experts in automotive electrical systems. Don't buy this car, and if you have one, trade it before you experience this problem; it is a safety issue. Bottom line, last Ford product I ever buy, too bad, I love the new Shelby Mustang!"

My cat converter needs to be replaced. This car drinks gas like crazy. It's a cool looking car, but not a good buy. This car breaks down a lot and ends up being an expensive couch."
mercury,cougar,2000,Raff, 04/27/2003,My 2nd Lemon,2,"I am the un-proud owner of a 2000 
Cougar, after Ford replaced my 1999 
Cougar that was plagued with issues.

The 2000 is no better!  New 
transmission in under 18K miles, sloppy 
front end, multiple front tire 
rebalancing, bad oil seal on the pan, 
coolant leaks, radio problems, bad 
left/front half axel, new brakes in 
under 20K miles, bad steering knuckle, 
and the list goes on!!!

Holman service is a disaster to boot.  
They replaced the trans and while 
driving home from the shop, the front 
left tire fell off!  Almost got killed 
on that one.  

Never again would I buy ANY Ford 
product!!"
mercury,cougar,2000,Vonlarl, 05/02/2003,"Sporty in looks, Tame under the hood",2,"Looks great. Harsh handling in steering 
wheel.  Excellent breaking power. 
Sluggish reaction to gas pedal. Needs 
more ""getup and go"", surprising for the 
horsepower of the V6. Almost think I'm 
driving a V-Tech with the poor 
performance in low RPMs.

Rigid body-nice for the 
turns. Poor stock tires, hard rubber 
that wears normally. Road noise 
excessive for the poor performance. If 
it was a true sports car, noise would 
be consistent. Replacement tires 
difficult to find and expensive(avg of 
$120 installed).

Fit and finish excellent.  Had 
difficulties with the hatchback trunk 
cover breaking repeatedly."
mercury,cougar,2000,kidfilter, 10/28/2007,"Great ride, but falls apart too quick",3,"Like many of the reviewers for this car, I started having troubles from day one, nothing too major front headlight was out and a recall for the steering, but still frustrating. My major problem with the car is the fuel system. Troubles started in 2003. I started running out of gas even though the gauge said there was gas in the tank. Now (2007) I can't let the car go below a 1/2 tank without worrying that I may run out of gas. I just replaced the alternator. The cupholder is dangerous. Sounds silly, but wait till you make a tight right turn in one of these babies and have a lap full of scalding coffee. Great handling, fun design. All trunk no backseat. Not good for people over 5'5""."
mercury,cougar,2000,Midge, 05/30/2003,"Problems, problems",3,"The car has been in the shop for 
numerous rattles, one air conditioner 
squeak. And, it has broken down three 
times for the brake safety sensor 
failure, thus leaving me stranded. The 
car will not go into gear when the 
sensor and brake lights fail. The 
service department doesn't know what is 
wrong. The car has been in the shop, 
maybe, 19 times for various repairs."
mercury,cougar,2000,OCEAN, 03/13/2002,Great all around,4,"weelll i got the 2000 v6 mercury cougar, and i have to say. its very appeling to the eye, great handling and i love the exterior and interior. I've added a few things to my cougar to make it a bit to, well how can i say this, so it could look more like a true sports car. ITS look beutiful. I've added a kit, spoiler, rims, z3 fender, and a top of the line pantjob. with these improvement the mercury cougar beat the celica, eclipse,civc and probable any other mid-size sport car"
mercury,cougar,2000,lz3d0b, 07/05/2003,Great Car,4,"I bought my Cougar new in early 2000 
and other than oil changes and very 
minor problems, it has performed 
flawlessly.  It handles great (compare 
it to a Grand Am and you will see what 
I mean) and has adequate power.  This 
was a vehicle that cost around 20K and 
it should not be compared to more 
expensive sports cars.  I found that if 
I needed extra power, I could switch 
overdrive off and it made a huge 
difference.  Just a fabulous blend of 
power and great gas mileage.  It is 
highly refined and the V6 is silky 
smooth. Wonderful exterior lines and 
there aren't a lot of them on the road. "
mercury,cougar,2000,Like to Driver, 04/04/2008,"No complaint, for what it when through",4,"I bought this car new in August 2000, fully loaded except for leather. I have driven the car very very aggressively from day one. Except for an alternator problem 1 1/2 yr ago. Had no problem.  I have driven this car everyday since new, I have no back vehicle. Currently have 340,000kms on the car now, and plan to keep it until I have to dig a hole and bury it. All I can say is ""take it for what it is."" It a nice inexpensive sports car that looks good. If you are looking for a Sunday afternoon drive car, this is not it. "
mercury,cougar,2000,MaineWolf, 04/19/2008,My Cougar,4,"I have been looking for recalls on the powered moonroof but I don't really see any. Mine is not opening at all, when I push the button, it sounds like it is opening but it's not. I just bought this car from a car dealer a month ago. I can, however, tell I am in need of an alternator soon! Thank God my dad was a mechanic and I learned a lot from him. But overall, I really love this car. It is jet black, leather interior, awesome sounds stereo (CD Player Equipped), Sporty, I just love it. I did get it used, but as with any vehicle, no matter make, model, year, new or used, you are bound to have problems. Take it to a mechanic before you purchase it to see if it's worth the price before buying!"
mercury,cougar,2000,cougowner, 04/22/2008,My Cougar,4,I bought this Cougar as a first car  in 2006 and so far it has been a pretty grear car. It is an absolute blast to drive! It could use a smoother ride and a new cup holder! I have recently had some odd issues with my electrical (Gauges act weird when started and mirrors and courtesy light just stopped working.)  So far nothing major has gone wrong with it though (crossed fingers!)  
mercury,cougar,2000,Dustin, 05/30/2008,Decent Car,3,"The Cougar is a fun, sporty car, so it turns tightly, rides stiffly, and the 5 speed manual shifts smoothly. But I have been unimpressed with the build quality. I changed my grille, put a new driver side mirror on, and ran subwoofer cables, so I have taken apart a lot of the car. Almost everything snaps together!  You know what holds the bumper on? Plastic pins. Most everything is plastic, especially the dash. And oh, what a noisy, squeaky dash it is, too. Drives me crazy. All in all, I'd say the Cougar is a decent car, but the build quality worries me, and I am going to soon upgrade to something more reliable and better quality. "
mercury,cougar,2000,Sara, 05/30/2008,Bought a Pretty Car & that's what I got!,4,"I bought my 2000 V6 Cougar used and drove it for 2 years with little incident, nothing but routine maintenance. In the two following years I replaced the alternator twice ($600 a pop), manifold intake gaskets about $500, rear brake caliper broke causing brake failure (I would be dead if not for engine brake) $600 for new caliper assemblies and pads.  I have also ""run out of gas"" - completely stalled - when going up hill with 1/4 tank of gas!  Had my car towed to the shop just to have it start and run just fine, the second time I topped it up with a jerry can and it was fine. Not yet replaced a fuel pump but it's not running well and I've been told that or dirt in the fuel tank, we'll see."
mercury,cougar,2000,Mb, 03/19/2020,A money pit,1,"I bought a 2000 cougar in 03 and had nothing but problems with it.  I was naive to buy 3000.00 in extended warrenty;  which i was never able to use. Electrical problems. Recall on fuel tank.  I went through 3 to 4 alternators because of a defective wire coming from alternator that was overlooked . OR was it, really? Windows stopped working..headlights were complete crap to drive with . 
A very nice looking car; i loved it..but should have gotten rid of it right away.  Despite replacing the fuel tank as a recall; it still was defective.  Good god people..run the other way with this car. "
mercury,cougar,2001,alznwonderland, 05/17/2011,This Cougar LOVES her Cougar!,4,"I bought my Cougar in 2003 with 19,000 miles on it. 88,000 miles later, I have had to sink about $2,000 in her. But for me, she is worth it. I get compliments all the time about how cool looking this car is.
I have replaced the computer, brakes, and most recently, the coil. I was having problems with surging, a gulping or missing action when I accelerated and my mechanic couldn't figure out what the problem was. I found that in 2004, the fuel module had been recalled and was effective to have it replaced until October, 2011. It was at that time the seviceman told me the coil is what was causing the ""missing"" affect. I had a friend replace it for $70.00. Runs like new again! I love this car!"
mercury,cougar,2001,cwe005, 04/22/2010,A pretty AMAZING car!,4,"It's a 2001 Mercury Cougar ZN. Its got close to 150,000 mi, and its a precision build machine! Like everyone says, it doesn't have a whole lot of power but the fact that it weighs close to 3500 lbs doesn't help either. It's amazing to drive. Corners like a beast, brakes like a beast, looks like a beast. It's a ZN, and it's had routine things go wrong with it (water pump, burnt out blinker bulbs, CD got stuck, transmission rebuilt) Its still amazing to drive though, on smooth pavement it rides like its on a cloud. 17"" rims mean tires are CRAZY expensive, but they make the car look amazing though! This is the sportiest daily driver you can have. But never get over 3K rpm, because I get 15 MPG"
mercury,cougar,2001,Love my cougar, 06/24/2010,Driving it til' it dies,4,"Bought my car 6 years ago for an awesome price from a friend. A couple car dealers, and mechanics told me that it was not a smart choice, had electrical problems, etc.  I was hesitant and nervous I would be fixing it a lot, but I still couldn't pass up the price.  Six years later, I have put nothing more than basic wear and tear money into it.  It is by far the best car I have ever owned! Wouldn't trade it for the world! So glad now that I made the right choice!"
mercury,cougar,2001,Estranged, 02/26/2002,Excellent Vehicle!!!,4,"I got my custom V6 manual in Feb01. It's custom 'cause I got convenience package + ABS brks. It's very fun to drive (both the stick and auto). Transmsn is designed/made in Germany and it shows! A very european car, with a huge trunk. The biggest plus of this car is handling. It has a computer: ""temperature outside"", ""average speed"", ""mpg"", and best of all ""miles before empty tank"". I'd also say that chicks dig the car - one made me roll down my window on the hiway to say how cool my car was."
mercury,cougar,2001,Superhawk5, 04/16/2004,Don't buy it with big kids!,4,"Bought it new and have had only two 
problems, the drivers seat belt 
wouldn't latch, dealer fixed it on 
warranty. I got some bad gas, three 
tanks of gas fixed it just like the 
owners manual said.
 I don't understand ""the engine could 
use a little more oomph"", my wife beat 
a Nissan 350 Z when she was going to 
the store.
 Awesome cornering capability. Keep the 
Firehawks on it, I got more than 80K 
miles out of the first set.
 Mileage exactly what the sticker said.
 Great value.
 Didn't get my son to sit in the back 
before I bought it. First drive in it, 
he hit his head on the hatchback 
window. At the time he was 14 and about 
5'6"". Now he will not sit in back."
mercury,cougar,2001,Angie K., 09/18/2016,Not A Smart Buy,4,"We bought this Cougar with 80,000 miles on it and it has been in the garage almost every month we've owned it.  Fuel Pump, Water Pump, Bearings and the list goes on.  Looks like a nice little car, but it is a money pit.  I have talked to other owners and they have said the same thing.  Definitely a ""Stay Away From"" Car.

mercury,cougar,2001,richie19r, 04/09/2010,Great on gas but a MONEY PIT,3,"Bought it with 79k for my wife in 98. Has 112k now. Car looks great outside, inside is a little small. I don't  know what everyone is talking about with the gas, i average 35 mpg going 60, and about 32 mpg going 70. so far, replaced both rear shocks, fuel pump, both timing chains, water pump, plugs, wires, all 4 brakes. Now I have about 3 different noises coming from the car, in which all i can't find. I'm tired of dropping money into it. As soon as something is fixed, something else needs fixed. I don't recommend it to anyone that can't work on cars!!"

These problems came and went for a couple years. nothing to big until this year my fuel pump went out but I was happy to find when I took it in to the dealership it was under recall so it didn't cost me a dime to repair. Although now I have a problem with the oil pan leaking then burning to make small clouds of white smoke. I took it in to be fixed which is about 12 dollars for the oil pan but since the engine sits on top of the pan it would cost about 3000 to fix all together! Other than that I have had no problems with the car, I love it!"

Although its a gas guzzler and thats do to it being we 2 tons. To me its a girls car but it was my moms so i drive it and plus it only has 33,000 on it. Pretty good for a 2001. The cougar is my second ride and so far its been fun. I see so many cougar lately on the road but i never see the one like mine. My cougar has added features that was being put on the 2002. "
mercury,cougar,2001,IndyCougar, 09/07/2002,Sweet!,4,"I was initially hesistant to purchase 
this car but, all it took was one short 
test drive and I was sold!  A little 
weak on power in the V6 but, the 
handling and other performance

that. Great ride, great handling and 
decent power, not too mention 
striking, ""ahead of its time"" looks!"

a little more than 170hp under the 
hood, but what this car lacks in power, 
It sure makes up for in handling!! Semi-
smooth ride, Has it's Corvette like 
qualities, Corners on rails! I once 
made a 80 deg. turn at 65 mph in a 4 
wheel drift, She went right where I 
wanted her to just by hitting or 
letting off the gas. However, Things 
are not all well in the Cougar stable. 
The 99 Cougar allong with select 2001's 
are having PCM programing problems. 
Causing hesitation in 1st and 2nd 
gears. Replacement of the PCM chip will 
determine which gear this problem will 
show up in."

I average around 24mpg city/highway. The transmission rotted through at around 80000 miles costing me $1,300. The sunroof failed to operate at around 82,000 miles. This car is a looker.

Now $5500.00 later, they took the 
cougar off the market to put in a

If the car is well kept it always looks
modern and sporty, I armor all every 200
miles, so far it drives great although
sometimes the open door buzz goes a
little too long, build quality is very
solid and the steering wheel is awsome
compared to most cars,because it has a
heavy ""meaty"" feel to it, I am a teen
and I can say the little features along
with over all quality is a perfect
match.  The car is cheep in terms of its
type, its out of production but has ons
of parts so it will always look good.

Pickup in first gear was a little slow, until I installed a short air intake, and new perfomance muffler; now this car has excellent acceleration. The 5 speed manual transmission is perfect, I love the shift. Exterior of the car is awesome, and interior is nice too. My only major problem has been my sunroof. It was supposed to have been replaced before I bought the car HA! It's not any better than the old one, it still leaks. Very  aggravating to come out to your car after a rain, and get soaked as you drive down the road. Overall, I love the car to drive, but, being a Ford, it does have problems."

I have had very few problems with this vehicle in the last 4 years.  Although I feel I had to replace the tires quite early into it's life.  My new tires are better than the originals.  Not so fast when you take off, but the Cougar gains it momentum quickly into it's take off. But yes, it could have used a bit more power.  Styling is great, adn more than enough interior space for the 2 front passengers.  The car had huge potential, and it's a huge shame it's life has been ended.  Overall, a great car."

I bought it with 74K miles on it, and it still gets an impressive 27mpg in the city and around 30mpg on the highway.  I upgraded the rims & tires, and added a Cold Air Intake, Aftermaket exhaust, throttebody spacer, and new plugs with NoLogy spark plug wires.  Previous owner had already put Koni Gas Shocks on it. It now Dyno's out at 235whp, and 220tq at the wheels."

mercury,cougar,2001,B. Grimms, 04/24/2003,"This Cat's a Dog, but I Love it Anyway",4,"Some owners seem anxious to complain 
about their Cougar; maybe I've just 
had good luck.  Other than the Duratec 
leaving something to be desired, I 
couldn't be much happier.

After test driving a Celica, Eclipse, 
and other coupes, I decided on this 
domestic V6.  I've been impressed 
by its handling, comfort, and interior 
design.  The pick-up is tepid, 
however, and I felt compelled to 
replace the obviously fake scoop.

I chose the Zn, but customized most of 
the special features anyway.  I'm not 
sure I'd go with yellow again, but 
it's easy to spot in a parking lot.

Until I have my midlife crisis, kids 
or both, I'm planning on enjoying this 
car for awhile."

Not just the mileage, but also maintenance and repairs (which have been few) FYI it does have a recalled fuel pump, which I haven't taken care of bacause problems don't surface if you keep the tank over half  full --- that's easier than keeping it in the dealership for an entire day;"
mercury,cougar,2001,Enos, 06/15/2007,Great starter car.,4,"Bought this car new to ride in college and have enjoyed it quite a bit in the 6 years I have owned it. I had a problem with the exhaust within the first year and the part was recalled I think. Since Ford payed for the replacement and I have had no problems since, I am quite satisfied. I find the car to be one of the most comfortable I have ever driven but I am a bit short at 5'7"" 170 pounds. It's definitly not meant for bigger people. The steering radius leaves a little to be desired and if you stick to the factory recomended tires, they can be quite expensive to replace. Those aside, I am very happy with the purchase and recomend it to anyone who isn't under 5'10"" 250 pounds."

Mine only had 70k miles on it, I took it for a 500 mile trip to Canada, and the engine blew up on the way home. Absolutely no warning signs, my warning lamps and gauges didnt show anything. The engine started making a knocking noise, we pulled over and the oil and belts were smoking, and the radiator fluid had boiled out. It was towed, and I was told I needed a new engine. I have found more and more people with the same problem. Due to an engine defect, the head gaskets leak, and allow water into the oil. A bearing in my engine literally disintegrated because of the heat and friction this condition caused. "

The transmission did go out around 64,00 and the fuel pump was replaced (both under warranty). Other than normal wear and tear, this car is great. People still compliment me on it, and I love to drive it.  However I hate how small the backseat is. I now have two kids and it's way too small, but we deal with it. I wish it took off faster and the mileage isn't real great - in my opinion. However it does the job and looks great and gets me from point A to point B.  I hate buying tires because they are expensive with the 17 inch rims. But I still love the car, regardless."

For the problem is upon beginning acceleration it don't want to its like a snail then sputtering upon high speed fine low speed definitely accident prone and seriously prayers are needed. Hopefully the coil will help this is awakening knowledge to me I am much thankful for and will try.  If I would have been notified of the recall the ford place of Florence SC would of help me.

I get approached by guys all the time about my car. I recently purchased this car for $1500. the previous owners thought that it needed a new computer. but once i got it home i noticed that the spark plugs were on wrong. lol so i got this great sexy car for cheap. i would give this car a 5 in every category but the back seat isn't to comfy. other than that this car is the best ever.!!!!

The car had one owner with a clean title new engine at 25,000 the freaking works. Super well maintained. Despite all that she dumped thousands into it, I bought it. Put only 4000 miles on it and drove it softly and here’s a list of things it needed. 1. New remotes 2. Rear struts 3. Wheel bearings. 4. The transmission is slipping so a real build soon. 5. Window motors. 6. Sunroof motor. 7. O2 sensors 8. Valve adjustment. 9. A alternator. The list goes on. Thank god I have half a brain and can do some of the stuff my self but there’s lots of big ticket items I can’t. It’s a small car and is NOT meant for you if your 6,3.  On to the more fun part of the 4,000 miles I’ve put on it. It’s been fun. Doesn’t burn oil and gas very good gas mileage (for a v6) despite all this still if you must buy a car I’d highly recommend steering clear of this guy. It kinda sucks and all the parts are out of production which means you can only find used parts. Enjoy it if you’ve made my mistake.  Pros? Zippy for its time Cons its broke. In many ways over the course of just a couple of miles not comfy for tall people.

mercury,cougar,2002,Michael, 03/27/2010,Beautiful Cat,4,"Notable information about the Cougar: -The engine was designed by Cosworth. They also design engines that go in formula one cars. Pretty respectable.  -The Cougar introduced ford's new Edge design. Notable among this is that the cougar is a blend between American and European design. The hatchback styling is European, the high displacement high torque engine is american muscle. It was designed to be at home on the twisty nuburing.  -Ford discontinued it because the Cougar dances around the Mustang. Ford wanted to sell Mustangs because they're in keeping with the all american Ford image. They also sold them for $20K more, the same thing was done to the Thunderbird. Twice."

It's got decent power for a 2.5 litre V6 and still gets around 27mpg.  Rear visibility isn't good and took some getting used to and it has a killer blind spot.  Turning radius is terrible when you're used to foreign cars, but it handles and rides very well.  Seats are comfortable and head and shoulder room are more than adequate for me (6 feet tall, 210 lbs.)  The tach has no redline and with the 5 speed stick and the engine being so quiet, that's an issue. Not surprised that Ford made this nice car and almost immediately discontinued it. "

feel of the car is great.  I also can 
not understand why Mercury is 
discontinuing this car.  It could give 
the Eclipse/Acura NSX/ Toyota/etc.  a 
ride for their money if Mercury would 
enhance some things."
mercury,cougar,2002,Raymond A. Garrido, 08/23/2002,"The best car for the money ""excellent""",4,"I really was'nt thinking to buy a new a 
car, but I have to admit that when i 
test drove the Cougar v6 with the c2 
package I fell in love with it!! With 
the help of the Salesman Mr. Carlo 
everything went smoothly, needless to 
say that Mr. Alvarez the finance Mgr. 
put every effort on it, I got a good 
interest rate  & a cash rebate, the car 
handles like a European car, the 
performance only compared with a good 
Sport Car it has plenty of power, I 
when I knew about a tune-up's every 
100,000 miles I said the American 
Automotive Industry finally got it.! 
It's very confortable for two people 
(in  the front) forget 4 on a trip."
mercury,cougar,2002,Cougar for life, 09/28/2002,"""The only car I want to drive""",4,"I previously owned a 1999 cougar which 
was my first car when I was a junior in 
high school, but I was foolish and 
traded that car in when it had 46000 
miles on it.  Now, I am a sophmore in 
college and I recently purchased a 2002 
cougar.  This one is the Ultimate 
version.  Both of my cougars have been 
excellent cars.  The minute I get into 
them I get a feeling like the car was 
made specifically for me.  That is 
probably the best thing about the car.  
What else can I say?  I haven't had any 
problems with either of the cougars 
I've owned."
mercury,cougar,2002,cherse Fell, 10/02/2002,i got a 2000 cougar its really great!,5,"i got mine a few months ago and while i was driving late one night i hit a 
raccoon and it really damaged my flood lights and the front end of my car 
around there and that was only a raccoon thats the only problem and its 
reallly expensive to get it fixed but i still will cause i love it its a really great 
car to drive and its confortable and its overall great."
mercury,cougar,2002,Steve Masch, 10/24/2002,FRONT ROTORS PROBLEM,3,"I drove the Cougar over 90K miles.
Automatic transmission, still averaging 
23.5 Miles per gallong. I usually 
cruise at 85-90 Miles per Hour.

The car is still driving strong but it 
was not built as well as I thought and 
it started to fall apart. Minor things 
for the most but the biggest problem 
has been the FRONT ROTORS that KEEP ON 
WORPING. I do drive quite aggressively 
and brake accordingly but I had to 
bring the car back for rotors 
replacements twice and had them 
substituted twice till I decided to 
shallow out a few hundreds for high 
performance parts. The sunroot too is 
easily damageable, twice I had to have 
it fixed."
mercury,cougar,2002,Oregonian, 11/08/2002,What a great buy for a great car!,5,"We have had no problems with our 2001 
Cougar. It is VERY fun to drive and 
has a huge interior considering its 
exterior size. The styling jumps out 
at others and turns about 20 heads a 
day when we drive about 20 miles a 
day. The front and especially rear leg 
room is generous. It's sad that 
Mercury is discountinuing the Cougar 
for 2003, but this is your chance. We 
recommend this car to any buyer young 
or old, short or tall. And the price 
is right too. Normally, the price 
starts around $16,000. Now, since it's 
getting discountined, you can get a 
new Cougar for way under $10,000 if 
that seems believable, but according 
to our local dealerships, it's true."

But when I saw the new XR package I knew I had found the car I was looking for. So far I have nothing but great things to say about the car; it drives great, looks great and is an awesome car for picking up chicks. The stereo system is also great and the leather seats are so comfortable. The car has great steering and makes tough, sharp right turns easy. This is a great car worth every penny spent."
mercury,cougar,2002,prefab, 06/26/2002,my2cents,4,"hello. i owned a 99 i4 5 speed. on a whim, i test drove the car. i was
very pleasantly surprised! i never would have given a ford or any other
american make a look. i prefer hondas/acuras. nonetheless i bought
the cougar. i love(d) the styling, the handling, the braking power. i
found the driver's seat extremely comfortable and the mpg was acceptable.
i fretted over the reliabilty of the vehicle as i began to have some problems
with my own and i noticed that the resale value has plummetted.
that is why buyers out there are getting great deals on buying their
new cougars. expect poor resale values. i unloaded my car."

best I've ever had.  V6,5 speed.  Mine

those that don't know, it's got really 
cool ground effects, rear spoiler, 17"" 
wheels with the Roush emblem, Roush 
floormats and an exhaust tip that makes 
it sound like a bumble bee.  I was 
hesitant on leather interior and black 
for the color but I was sold on the 
Roush package.  It's a 2000 model and 
it only had 7000 miles on it (was 
reposessed and passed around 
dealerships) when I bought it for 
$14500.  My old car was a Neon and for 
$5000 more it's a helluva deal!  I love 
it!  And get compliments ALL THE TIME!"

pkg really adds to the look. DO NOT 
plan to have more than 2 people in it! 
Gas mileage is very good. The car 
handles curves extremely well. The 
engine is sluggish on start, but does 
well once on the road. Make sure you 
watch your blind spots - this car 
provides several."

a lemon, when speedometer broke and my

have been in and out of the service 
shop because my car stops while I'm 
driving, with no warning at all.  I can 
be on the highway or on streets, and it

in handeling.  The only downside to the 
car is that by all means it looks fast, 
but in this case looks are deceving.  
This car is unfortunitly underpowered.  
That aside it has been everything and 
more than what I expected for a Mercury

I have had no problems and have put 8k miles on it making a grand total of 51k. I dont know if its too soon to talk but it handles great, is a comfortable and quiet ride on the interstate, and gets great gas mileage (after driving 250 miles at 75 mph I have half a tank left). For a 2dr car the back seat is very roomy and comfortable except it does not seat very tall people well."

something else. Its not like the 
cougar is slow. I can hang with

CD player 6 cd in dash also ATE cd's and got stuck even after repairs to it.  Needed to do the brakes sooner than would be expected.  I was told that this was due to the front wheel drive or something..  Not only the brake pads, but also the rotors usually need to be replaced every time on this type of brake system.  They don't tell you that when you buy it.  Next came the dead battery..  at about 25,000 miles.  Just as it fell outside of warranty in terms of years, not miles, it needed the alternator replaced.  This was at 32,000 miles. This is when I dumped the car, ate the negative equity, leased a Mazda"
mercury,cougar,2002,Steve, 08/09/2006,2002 Mercury Cougar V6 Ultimate A4,3,"I bought this car used with 80k miles.  It hasn't been a bad car, though it hasn't been the best.  The styling is sharp and the interior isn't bad.  I find it to be rather low on power, but I am used to cars with much more power (had to buy something for gas mileage).  Speaking of mileage, I'm getting appx 22mpg combined city/hwy.  I've had some electrical issues, but other than that, it seems rather reliable *knock on wood*.  It's also not too boring to drive (sure, it's no Corvette, but it's more enjoyable than a Civic).  The styling has worn well considering the trends to edgier designs (and especially since the car was discontinued 4 years ago)."

I have previously owned a Probe as well as a 98 Escort and the ride is a lot better than either of those.  This car takes corners and turns like nothin else!  I don't even feel the turn.  It's a beautiful car, I've washed it every other day since I've had it.  The only thing I've noticed on it is the paint chips VERY easily.  I almost want to avoid the express way with this baby because of it.  I see a paint job in the future....."

It could beat a V6 mustang anyway (yea woo-hoo). Since then I've spent maybe $1500 on performance parts off ebay and installing them myself and it's made a world of difference. The Dual Exhaust with a couple of flowmasters and the cold air intake (about $500 for both) really add a lot of power, and a decent suspension that went for about $450 made this thing handle turns easily at 45+ mph (although it doesn't balance well). A few other small mods and this car's performance can keep up with its fast looks. Keeps up with a friend's souped-up RSX easily!"

Nice big trunk, a lot bigger than a lot of people think. Gas mileage isn't the best, but it is a V6, so what do you expect? We have previously had Honda's and Toyota's and this car is so much better than any Honda or Toyota we have had. The seats are incredibly comfortable and we actually take this car on long trips rather than our CRV. It handles really well and the cruise is right on. Very smooth ride and you can't even feel it shift. I would recommend this car to anyone!"

2002 Mercury Cougar. It's not a car for 
everyone, but I like it. A sporty look 
inside and out, but is still fairly 
economical and reliable. Handles well 
around town or on the Interstate. The 
car is so smooth it hardly seems like 
you're going fast when the speedo 
reaches the higher numbers. Fold down 
split rear seats make for ample cargo 
room in the rear of the vehicle. No 
mechanical problems in 10,000 miles and 
the dealer has treated me very well 
during routine maintenance. This car is 
a real bargain if you want something 
fun, reliable and economical."

I've put a few performance things on it such as a cold air intake and a muffler and am hoping to get it tuned very soon because it is running lean. I've had not problems as far a reliability and performance. I get what I expect from my care everytime I step on the gas. I think it is the best car I've ever owned and wish they would make another one with maybe a bigger engine. I don't think I'll be getting another car until this one is completely gone. I will do anything to  keep it as long as possible.

mercury,cougar,2002,Katherine, 02/07/2003,Bought a Cougar Again,4,"This is my second cougar - many little 
annoyances in the 1999 model year were 
fixed in the 2002 (coin slots added, 
cup holder upgraded, no more plastic 
grate on front w/ pieces that pop out, 
CD changer in dash instead of trunk). 
It's a peppy car, a perfect fit, and 
has an eye-catching look. Not meant for 
big/tall people and the back seats are 
more useful folded down for more trunk 
space than as seats. Great for people 
who can't see over the steering wheels 
in typical mid-sized cars and for those 
who haul more stuff than people.  Can 
roll down the windows, open the 
sunroof, and not get blown to bits."

time comparing or looking on Edmunds.com
I found the hard way that you should 
always research what you buy, even if 
you (think you) know what you are 
getting.  Here's what I found:

1) the I4 engine is not powerful enough 
to run the airconditioning while 
driving up hill

2) You get no acceleration with this 
engine.

Maybe I have high expectations since I 
am in Germany and I'm rolling down the 
Autobahn next to BMWs and Audis but 
when you get the Autobahn you have to 
keep up!"
mercury,cougar,2002,purpix1, 03/14/2002,Not your Daddy's Cougar,4,"The short, round the block test drive I took with the new 2002 Mercury Cougar (2.5 v6), did not do this car justice. I bought the car however, based on other factors as well (price, fuel economy, options etc). After a few days of really getting the feel for this car on the open road, I began to realize the true sports car nature of this vehicle. Crisp, sure-handling, power and performance make for an effortless, yet exciting driving experience. You can really feel the sports car lurking within the Cougar on the curves. Smooth and sure-footed. The engine and transmission are smooth and responsive as well, with plenty passing power on the freeways."

It has had its share of repairs, including alternator, rear wiper wiring, and is currently in the shop to have the transmission resealed.
My moon roof stopped working while the alternator was going, but works just fine now.
This car is in great shape for going on 9 years old, and is fun to drive.

I finally got my chance when I traded in my Grand Marquis in January of 2002.  This car is amazing.  It still turns heads as I go down the road.  The car seems to be moving, even when it's parked.

I then discovered I had a Mercury dealer 3 blocks from work and, on a whim, took a test drive during my lunch hour.  That's all it took.  I did 3 laps around the block and bought it the next morning.  This car is fun to drive and has the look and feel of a very-well crafted machine.  I have the Sports model C2 package and could not be happier.  One caveat.. Keep your eye on the speedometer, you can easily be going 90-95 while it feels like 50mph."

mercury,grand-marquis,2000,Fred Nelson, 07/26/2010,2000 Grand Marquis LS,5,"I bought this car used in 2003 and it had only 9,200 miles on it. It now has 100,000 miles on it. The actual repair costs have been less than $1,000. I get 21 MPG around town and 25 MPG on the highway at 70 MPH. It's, without question, the best car I ever owned. I can't understand why Ford is discontinuing manufacture of the Mercury line. I guess they are trying to force us into ""golf cart"" cars."
mercury,grand-marquis,2000,KC, 09/05/2006,Everyman's BMW 745,4,"This is a marvelous car...my fourth Panther platform Ford. The car has so many aftermarket performance parts that it is hard to believe. There is actually a small performance cult that has grown up around them Mine has dual exhaust, with Dynaflows and an X-pipe, as well as Kumho A/S 795 tires (stock Michelins are a joke). I added a Superchips powertuner. I probably have about 260HP as of now and still get over 25 mpg/highway. Why people complain about the mileage on these cars baffles me...if you want a Honda Civic, go buy one! This car weighs 4,000 pounds. Addco sway bars and Bilstein shocks make the car handle dead flat. There is a reason why police use these cars (Ford CV version)."
mercury,grand-marquis,2000,Topcat, 09/11/2008,Good reliable vehicle,4,"Purchased new, have 169,000 miles. Replaced all four brake pads at 167,000. Replaced a/c comp at 148,000. No other cost except tires, oil changes, and transmission service. Have traveled on many long trips. Gas mileage from 23.8-to 25.0. I have the handling package with the 3.55 gear, dual exhaust, 16 inch rims. Mileage is better at below 70 MPH. My speed is 70+. This is my third panther body vehicle."

It was a hertz rental with 22,000 miles on it. This vehicle has performed extremely well, with super handling and comfort and most of all it is a safe vehicle for my wife in town and on the highway. Power is great and gas mpg is good. As a race car driver in the past, I really like rear wheel drive and this car has met all my expectations! "
mercury,grand-marquis,2000,Dan, 11/17/2010,Timex in a digital age,3,"This car puts comfort and reliability above all else. It is amazingly comfortable although I wish the seats offered more side bolstering to keep you in place through the turns. It is VERY reliable. nothing has broken or worn out in its 62K mile life. Lots of room in the cabin and trunk though Id like a center console for storage. The driving experience is muted by vague steering and minimal road feel. The car wallows over bumps and turns and doesn't instill confidence in its handling, especially in wet conditions. The power train is adequate and the car never feel out of breath although more power would be welcome for passing. MPG is ok given its a 2 ton car, I get about 19."
mercury,grand-marquis,2000,Robert, 07/28/2006,What a great car!,5,"I bought this car in May of 2006 for my wife, Being 22 years old I was ify about buying whats classified as an elderly persons car, but it is great. It had 51,000 miles on it when we bought it and within 2 weeks of owning it we went on a trip from souther florida (home) to Vermont to visit family. With gas at about $3 a gallon it only cost us about $200 to drive from florida to Vermont. It was extremely comfortable and we were albe to fit everything in the trunk! In the trunk we had 3 medium suitcases, 2 large suitcases, 4 fishing poles, 3 tacle boxes, 6 person tent, 2 sleeping bags, playpen and stoller. The Drive was comfortable and I'd recommend this car to anyone, simply awesome!"

I buy them with about 50,000 miles for about 50% of their original sticker price and easily put on another 100,000 with very few repairs. They offer enough room for me, my spouse, and our three kids for medium length trips. (We use the van for longer jaunts.) It is very comfortable on highways as I travel for business or recreation, and the white car with a law enforcement profile doesn't hurt either. "

mercury,grand-marquis,2000,JD, 11/21/2015,Smooth Comfortable car.,5,"Good used car buy. Very reliable platform shared by Ford/Linconln/Mercury. This results in low cost of maintenance and easy availabilty of parts. For most of it's long run production numbers were high. Usually owners were older so a good relatively low mileage version should't be hard to come by. Air suspension is smooth and not as prone to failure or expensive to fix as some would lead you to believe. Watch for head gasket failure (iron block/aluminum head, different expansion rates). 4.6 is a smooth reliable engine in this application. Decent gas mileage for this year 23hwy/18city. Very quite, adequate performance in every situation, has no trouble getting out of it's own way. I drive between 500 and 800 miles per week and this is a great way to do it. If you looking to buy one of these used, do your do diligence, but I would suggest it. Really good used car, no regrets.

I get 31 MPG on HWY and 22 to 25 MPG city with the 302 V8. My parents bought this car when it was new and I got it from them when they purchased a new car. Very little work has been done to it over the years and still running great.

I did some preventative maintence on it when I first got it and after that, the car runs like a dream. I get about 23 mpg average just running around town. I would have to say that that is extremely well for a V8 engine."
mercury,grand-marquis,2000,Alma in Nashville, 05/24/2009,Best car I ever owned,4,"I purchased the 2000 Grand Marquis Mercury LS as a 'program car' meaning it had been owned by Avis Rental Cars and it had 20,000 miles on it.  It is over 135,000 miles now and I have had less trouble with the car than any I ever owned.  I love the way it handles, the huge trunk and carrying capacity.  I sincerely enjoy the 8 cyl engine for its quick speed in traffic in the city.  The single drawback is the low gas mileage, but it does use regular gas so that has helped.  I want to purchase another car exactly like this one!"

mercury,grand-marquis,2000,wallywow, 04/08/2008,Owned mine 8 years so far.,4,"Purchased this brand new. Excellent car. No breakdowns in over 8 years. All I did was routine maintenance. The coolant temperature sensor went bad 3 years ago, but everything still works fine. Surviving 8 Michigan winters with no rust, and the original exhaust system still in great shape is a miracle. If gas weren't so high I'd be buying another one. I do mostly city driving, but my car still gets great mileage on the highway. It's like driving in the safety of a tank with a sofa inside."

A big comfortable highway cruiser for our occasional road trips. I've since added dual exhaust, rear air shocks and replaced those awful plastic wheel covers with the cast aluminum laced wheels. Will also have to replace the original intake manifold (with plastic coolant passages) before our next trip. Only design flaws are radio and heater controls not in easy reach, wide floor sill under doors makes exiting the car a little clumsy. Power windows are getting slow, common for Fords.  "

Acceleration is adequate or good if you are lucky enough to find one with the performance package this car has been very economical, cheap insurance good gas milage (27 mpg at 75 mph) and only about $200 in repairs at 130k thats doing a lot of towing too"

Gas mileage at 20 mpg for a V8 is unbelievable. Comfortable ride with spacious interior. Style hasn't changed much over the years. I don't think they can improve on it! 
mercury,grand-marquis,2000,Michael J. Salter, 12/07/2008,Finest Car out there,5,"I am 16 almost 17, and this is my first car, and it is awesome. I am the only one at my high school that drives a Grand Marquis, and all my friends that drive Mustangs and foreign cars are just in awe of this car. For a car that weighs 5,237 lbs it does an excellent job. I normally gets 22-25 MPG around town, and 27-35 MPG on the highway. The ride is just as good if not better that a Cadillac, because it just floats down the road. And as far as performance and handling it does really good. It has a 16V 4.6L V8 that produces around 233 HP stock. And the traction control is rather nice on icy mornings, beacuse I just put it down in first gear and it's like there is no ice. This is a great car!"
mercury,grand-marquis,2000,KitGerhart, 02/04/2005,I like the key pad door locks,4,"I'm a ""snow bird"" and leave this car in Florida year round and drive another car back and forth from Indiana.  The Grand Marquis has been reliable so far, and is comfortable.  The steering feels kind of numb, but the handling is ok for such a big tank, helped by the handling package on my car.  Considering the size of the car and my many short trips, it gets decent gas mileage, 17-18 ave.  I get 25 on the highway, better than most 6 cylinder SUV's."
mercury,grand-marquis,2000,Nancy, 02/27/2008,2000 Grand Marquis,4,This car has been the best in reliability of any cars I've owned.  I have had the car for 8 years and never had to put a dime into it.  It still looks and runs great.  The gas mileage around town is about 18 miles a gallon and about 22 on long drives.  It would be great for older folks who can't get in smaller cars.
mercury,grand-marquis,2000,vanillaice, 12/17/2006,follow-up,4,"This car is so good, it's like not owning a Ford. After 70,000 miles, exactly zero dollars and zero cents in unscheduled maintenance.   Incredible value especially as a used car.  High altitude seems to hurt the performance inordinately, but maybe it's just me.  A Toyota should be so reliable.  Very large trunk is a little oddly shaped.  This was done to fix exploding gas tank.  Still, I wish they would do another work-around to bring back true ""three body trunk"" capability.     Easily the best kept secret in the auto world.  "

The HPP (handling & performance package ). Most don't know about these because there is no marking on the cars. They came with bigger swaybars,beefed-up trans,bigger brakes,air-ride,digital dash, dual exhaust,3.55 gears, leather wrap steering wheel, lacey spoke wheels, speed sensative steering and rated at 29HP more than the regular GS or LS. They are faster than the P71 (police car) with a better ride than the Towncar. I have 92,000 miles on mine and only had to do the basics to it (tires, brakes, wipers a battery and the license plate light. Not bad for a 9 year old car! The HPP gets 17, 25 hwy"

brakes squeek because the have steel in 
them and the rims click because of a

For a car this large interior space is disappointing, Chrysler's cab forward design makes offers far more interior space, roomy in front seat but back seat leg room is disappointing. Car is not very nimble. But suspension is not mushy like some cars in this class, body roll not excessive. Huge trunk. Easy to get in and out. Pretty good acceleration.Car has been very reliable but steering wheel locked up and had to be towed to shop. Okay gas mileage for such a big car.

Very powerful and quick to take off. Will definitely spin a pair of tires off. But, the transmission was terrible from the start, and the interior sizing is terrible for a car of its size. It's like they crammed to much sound canceling material into it before they thought about how they were going to fit the seats into it with enough room for the passengers to be comfortable in it. Air is great, I like the fact that it is a climate control system. Radio is terrible. And the rearview mirror is placed entirely to low. I wouldn't recommend this car to really anyone. "

This car DOES ""float/glide"" on the road which is typical for a large sedan. Once you do drive it though you will get used to the floaty sensation. This car has a EXTREMELY soft suspension which is good for people like me who live on Long Island NY and have roads that have a ton of pot holes and bumps. Going over a series bumps on a rough road will feel like vibrations. 

This car has A LOT of power for a car this size and weight! I was surprised on how much power it has when I floored it! The seats are very soft which is very comfortable!

The Grand Marquis is a big, powerful, and comfortable boat. It is spacious in all aspects from the interior room to the size of the trunk. It floats along, but after some time in the drivers seat, you learn how to drive this car perfectly. I live in Muncie Indiana, the pothole capital of the world, and the suspension absorbs everything. The stereo is also better than you would think. If you drive calmly, you get fairly good gas milage. If you drive aggressively, you still go far thanks to the 19.5 gallon fuel tank.

Reliability played a large part in my decision process, I'm a retired officer from a county in Pa. the fords I drove every day were ( and are ) very reliable vehicles. I just moved up a rung on the ladder of the vehicle that I drove for twenty years. "

mercury,grand-marquis,2001,Carl, 03/27/2006,My Opinion,4,"I have been well pleased with My Gran Marquis. It is my second one and I plan on getting another. It is especially good for long trips. It provides an extreemly smooth and comfortable ride, with good acceleration, and responsive handling. I get about 20-22 MPG on the highway at speeds crowding (sometimes exceeding) the limits. I appreciate the large trunk space. I have driven it from St Louis, MO. to Niagra Falls, Orlando, through the Rockies and to numerous shorter (300-400 Miles) with no breakdowns or difficulties. I am proud of my ""Merc""."
mercury,grand-marquis,2001,Juan Valdez, 07/24/2006,2001 mercury grand marquis ls,4,"Great car to do the open road in. Gas mileage is better than you would expect from a car this large.The only problem is the rear shocks/spring set-up. If you do not want the rear of the car to sit low in rear loaded, you need to put overload shocks on it. With these on you still have a great ride, with no sag. Climate control is a must have option, now that I experienced it. Also do the cloth interior, no cold or sticky leather. If I had to buy another car right now, it would be another Mercury Grand Marquis LS."

The 2001 is peeling in the seams around the back window and roof and have started to rust! The 2004 has the major paint problem! I have the same problem as the 2001 but, much, much worse! The roof paint is literally bubbling off the metal as it is around the back window! The weird thing is that I met a woman at the gas station (that has a 2003 marquis).

mercury,grand-marquis,2001,R.Y., 06/07/2008,They keep building them,4,"As another person mentioned, this car is a sleeper. The 210hp 4.6L V8 with SOHC provides very good performance while giving surprisely good gas mileage. I get 30 mpg Imperial (Canada) driving at over 60mph or 100kmph. This engine is designed for fuel efficiency while being powerful enough at .75 hp per cubic inch. The car is designed for comfort, which is why I like the arm rests instead of a storage bin. If you want a storage bin, buy an after market product for the transmission hump. Yes, the power windows are slow and you wish they would go faster when you are in a hurry, but that's not a deal breaker. You can still buy a 2008 Mercury Grand Marquis. "
mercury,grand-marquis,2001,Chris, 06/23/2008,Reliable,4,"I have a 2001 Grand Marquis LS and it is a very reliable car even with over 174,000 miles on it. The only things that kept this thing from starting was a few bad alternators and at about 170,000 miles a bad ignition switch. The gas mileage in this thing is a killer. I get about 15 city and 22 highway, but I don't drive like the car is made for, a grandma. For a V8 this car's horsepower is way less than impressive, most V6's and a lot of l4's nowadays have more power than it. If you want a safe, reliable family car then the Grand Marquis is the way to go. If I were to buy it again I would rebuild it to how Ford should have."

it smooths out the best around 80 mph,

say that the overall fit and finish,

Fifteen months and 25,000 miles the 
only repair has been a turn signal

It is very comfortable and the AC and

noise is moderate.  The interceptor

average 17 mpg city and 23 mpg

We were loaned a car to get around with and treated well. Upon our return, I submitted bills for hotel and meals which were promptly paid.

One can only sit on 3/4 of the front seats as the seat belt receptor is solid and sticks up through the seat. It can not be moved. Without that seat belt reception problem, one could sit in the middle of the seat and get support on the right side of the cushion. As it is one sits on the left side support and middle of seat: extremely uncomfortable. It would be ok for a small person, i.e., 100 pounds or less could sit in middle."

Starts, runs, and drives without any complaints.  The car is much quicker and handles better than the 94, but the exhaust is noisier, the ride is firmer, and the steering much less isolated from the road.

mercury,grand-marquis,2002,Roy, 05/24/2007,Good Car that Could Be Better,3,"My experience with FoMoCo products is that they are good ideas poorly executed. My Mercury is a case in point.  While perfect for people looking for a traditional RWD sedan that owns the road, this car lacks the solidarity and reliability its predecessors possessed.  It handles well for its size in braking, acceleration, and cornering.  It also is a good ride on the highway.  But don't expect too much from it. The engine has mounds of torque but is noisy when pressed. The engine is a great performer, but you got to go light on the gas unless you (a) can afford speeding tickets and (b) are related to a Saudi prince and have inherited your own private oil well.  "

Another surprise was the terrible city mileage, much lower than the stated 17 mpg, around 10 mpg. Highway ok w/25 mpg. As I've seen mentioned I have to agree the lack of a center console leaves one stuffing everything into the paltry pockets given in the front seats or on the floor. So despite the wonderful smooth ride the overall economy leaves me wishing we'd shelled out for a Camry etc. PS.Loaner car during fuel pump was a Sable '05. It was a gas hog also (15mph?!). Ford/Mercury needs to wake up"
mercury,grand-marquis,2002,Sam, 12/17/2005,My Marquis is Junk,2,"This car is junk.  I can't even start it half the time.  The alarm system will not disarm.  It had a water leak and smells like swamp water.  There is nowhere to put anything.  It is total junk.  I've already had to replace the exhaust system.  It is basically $22,000 worth of junk.

but removed illuminated front door ""lamp reflectors"" (side of door when you

toplid carpeting and glove compartment damper (it just falls now, instead of a

I can't find another auto that comes close to delivering the bang for my buck. The engine is strong and the Premium ride is that of a Town Car, of which I possess as well.

everything that you get in a Lincoln

favorably with Buick, Olds, Pontiac 
and Chrysler.  I would buy another 
with no hesitation."
mercury,grand-marquis,2002,Chuck801, 04/17/2002,But I don't feel like a Grandpa!!,4,"Which is a good thing since I'm only 
45.  There just comes a time in every 
man's life when he gets tired of those 
small, 4 passenger, no power cars.  
When you're ready for something bigger 
with some major power, the GM is it.  
Truth be told I really wanted a 
DeVille, but for a little more than 
half the price I got the same style, 
roominess, comfort and POWER!  OK maybe 
it doesn't have the GPS.  A real man 
wouldn't use that anyway.  When you're 
ready to give up on those toy(ota) cars 
and step up to some style, check out 
the Grand Marquis.  For the first time 
in 15 years, I'm not embarrassed to 
offer to drive."
mercury,grand-marquis,2002,virg, 11/17/2002,Value for the Dollar,4,"After much shopping around looking at 
comparitable cars, I chose the Grand 
Marquis because of its size, V8 engine, 
and rear wheel drive. This car was 
thousands cheaper than comparable cars 
with the same equipment and platform. 
The car has plenty of smooth, quiet 
power coupled with a turnpike ride that 
suits my tastes. While it doesn't shine 
in fuel economy, it still gets much 
better milage than a 64 Dodge Dart I 
had with a 273 V8.

Overall; I think the Grand Marquies and 
the Ford Crown Victoria are two of the 
best values for full size cars in 
todays market."

I also own a Toyota Avalon which is ten times better.  The Mercury takes 9.7 seconds to get from o-60 with a v8 engine with 224 HP and the Avalon takes 8.5 seconds with a v6 engine with 210 HP. If you want a big boat go Linclon, Toyota, Lexus, or Acura.  This car has been in the shop ever 40,000 miles.  It has mainly been in the shop for electric problems and loud radding.  Go Toyota Boo Ford!"

small/medium cars and wanted a larger
car with a lot of premium features. This
car is VERY comfortable, and the ride is
smooth. Granted, I'm probaby one of the
younger buyers of a car reserved for a
more mature audience, but I wondered why
I haven't looked into a larger car sooner.

a Lincoln Town car or Cadillac in its

that you can get a GM at.  So I cannot 
see myself spending an extra 10 or 15 
thousand just for a name so a the Grand

for a large highway cruiser.  I wanted 
to get a Lincoln Towncar (mostly 
because, hey, it's a Towncar) but found 
that the Grand Marquis was, basically, 
a Lincoln for alot less cash. 
So far, my only complaints are that it 
isn't as quiet as my Buick.  There is 
annoying wind noise at highway speeds 
that make me want to turn the stereo 
up. Also, the factory tires spin on wet 
pavement when accelerating moderately 
from a stop. Unfortunately, I haven't 
driven it in over 10 months since I

flawlessly producing approximately 19

Same: Road/Wind noise is too high, especially the windshield when it's raining. Odd huh?  Suspensions: The '02 is MUCH stiffer than the old boat-like ride the '94 has. This would be personal preference for which is better. To me, the '94 is better for highway cruising.  Interior: '02 is more stylish, but some of the items seem to be of cheaper material. I like the '94s button layout better.  Exterior: '02 a bit sportier looking but I prefer the rims on the '94. '02s are very generic looking to me.  Other stuff: Give me a real antenna! The built in one for the '02 just doesn't pick up the signal as well!"

It is powerful with relatively good gas mileage. It handles well except when going over large bumps or washboard pavement, when it loses its direction. It's quiet inside and has a tastefully done interior. I've only found a few faults. The door-checks are useless. The front power windows are under-powered. I wonder how long they'll last past the warranty. Although it's billed as a six passenger car, it's really only good for five passengers. The middle front ""seat"" is only good in a pinch. Overall, though, it's a great car for the money!"
mercury,grand-marquis,2002,Jacque Montague, 03/27/2017,I see why these are so popular.,5,"I purchased one of these used, from the original owner, the car currently has 125,154 miles on it and still is in excellent shape both cosmetically, and mechanically. This car is very simple to maintain, and everything is simple to use, no fancy things like on modern cars, but isnt completely in the dark ages. Instrumentaion is plenty, and easy to read, stock radio is very good, and cassette deck is still working fine. The leather interior has also held up very well for being 15 years old and has no holes or tears, trunk space is absolutely massive! A perfect summer home rental for tourists! The 4.6L V8 is an excellent motor, and can get out of its own way when asked to, and I personally get about 18.5MPG in town and 26MPG out on the highway on 87 octane. Its been an excellent car, and I can see why they last so long, one of Ford's highest reliability cars/platform! I would recommend one of these to anyone who's looking for a smooth car, with excellent reliability, cheap to service, but still doesnt kill the pocketbook on gas.

While other vehicles rely on technology and styling that fades, the Marquis uses its heft and V8 engine to isolate you from the rest of the world. The quiet and smooth engine in my car has been trouble free even after 12 years. The transmission makes the most of the 224hp with the aid of Mercury's Precisontrac limited slip rear axle. Combine this with the last full frame in a sedan and the soft leather bench seats and you have a car that can easily carry five people (six when necessary) anywhere in solid comfort.

I could never say that with the other makes that I have owned.  This car seats six in comfort, very smooth ride, huge trunk, excellent acceleration, very low maintenance, and gas mileage at 20 mpg city, and 26 mpg hwy.

I have never been in a more comfortable car, its very quiet and it rides wonderfully with that air suspension. It's a shame that its viewed as an ""old person's car,"" because I am 20 years old,and love the car. It is extremely easy to handle, park, and drive; people who complain about bad parking or bad handling need to go back to driving  school.

Reliability is excellent, with one exception - at just over 36,000 miles the right rear wheel bearing started whining.  I found out that this was a problem for 03 Crown Vics and Grand Marquis built prior to Jan 03, which mine was. Both rear axle bearings and the spindles were replaced. The car was out of warranty, but since I was a regular customer of the dealer, I got a pro- rated partial warranty payment.  Fuel economy tops out at about 25 highway at cruising speed of 75 or so.

mercury,grand-marquis,2003,JimBeam, 01/05/2009,The last great American sedan,4,"The Grand Marquis isn't a perfect car, but it's close. Driving is effortless. The base V8 provides more than enough power to get you into trouble. The car gently glides over bumps and potholes instead of jarring the passengers like most cars. Handling is surprisingly sharp for such a large car. It has enough room to seat five adults comfortably and an extra seat belt if you have to take six. I have the LS Limited, which is almost as nice as a Town Car for a lot less. Because Ford rarely changes them and the old cop Crown Vics flood the used market, there are plenty of deals available. These cars last forever, so even a used one will probably last longer that most new cars."

The MGM is by far the best car I have ever owned, inside and out. I've given this car the highest ratings all around including fuel economy. I find though my research most larger cars as well as mini-vans or other family sized vehicles average around 20-25 mpg. I average about 25 mpg (26.7) to be precise with my Grand Marquis. Now factor the size and weight and power of the car and compare that on a scale to ANY small car or large car. You will find the MGM is the green or most fuel efficient car on the road. Outside of fuel economy, I rate the reliability five stars. MGM has a proven record and still holds it."

This car goes form FLINT, MI TO PONTIAC, MI 5 days a week (410 miles just driving to work ) and I party on the weekend driving from PONTIAC MI to DETROIT MI 3X A MONTHS (180 miles of partying  the big city ).
I have had to replace my axle seals twice once in 2012 and then in 2015. I had to replace my intake gasket in 2014.  I got my first tune up 2015 and the shop said I still didn’t need to tune it up but i just did it because it’s beens over 100,000 since I bought the car. This car is a beast I have had a total of 11 cars in my life but this car is the best. I’m going to drive my car until 2016 then buy another car but I’m keeping my 2003 Grand Marquis.

mercury,grand-marquis,2003,yv, 03/28/2008,Best Bang for Your Buck,5,Have owned this car for 3yrs bought it used with 39K has 75k miles now and it has just been super! No mechanical problems at all. Rides excellent handles excellent. Had it recently in snow and ice with no problems. I'm looking to purchase a newer Grand Marquis within the next year. Gas mileage is 27hwy and 19 city. City could be better but compared to the size and room its a bargain. SUV with same seating area get much less. I love the RWD it is so stable no hydro plaining on rainy roads. I hope Ford Motor doesn't quit making this excellent car!
mercury,grand-marquis,2003,bdemedio, 07/12/2006,2003 GS Grand Marque,5,"Superb vehicle. A Lincoln Town car for half price. Incredible power. 17 city is an underestimate- I get 20. I get 30 on the highway even with lights (rte 13 in Delmarva). No problems at all to date. Still smells new. 24 bucks a year upkeep and much lower than average insurance. The toyota avalon is JUNK compared to this. Some of them are already rusting. I'll play chicken with any of you avalon drivers anyday- you won't live and I'll walk away without a scratch. Anyone with children owes it to them to have this great machine because of its safety, durability, power, and mileage. Why do you think its the preferred car for cops and cabbies? It's the best car made in the world for the price."
mercury,grand-marquis,2003,JSheehan, 05/21/2008,Classic luxury with sport performance,5,I have owned my Merc for a couple of months now it is my second Grand Marquis. I've got the state trooper package so it handles amazingly (the air ride which is standard isn't bad either) The 4.6 puts out close to 300 for hp and torque (modest estimate) at it's power band it's probably well over that.  You can red line it forever without over heating it.  Super easy to install a super charger and HP chip which put's it over 500 HP and torque.  Very nice interior/exterior. Avg 25MPG stock I get an AVG of 32 with the supercharger in it.  Handling is comparable to large Lexus and Mercedes.
mercury,grand-marquis,2003,D.S., 10/30/2006,Best car I ever owned!,4,"This is the best car I ever owned. Went from a '90 Towncar to this. Great ride, handles like a sports car. Will pass anything with ease. Mileage is 23 mpg. The LX with all the bells and whistles would be nice too. One down side is it is smaller inside than a TC but everything short of a van is. If you are looking at one to buy I would jump at it. Great safety, dual air bags. Handles like a sport car, rides like a luxo coupe. Good mileage, lots of space. Looks fantastic. If you want a more sporty ride get the Marauder. But I can not fault this car. Just did a trip with it and the cruise stays within 3 mph of where you set it going up and down hills."

hwy and 15 mpg around town. Very 
disapointed in the 2003 as I was

horsepower.Truth in advertising!!???"

of power from 4.6 liter V-8 allowed us 
to merge safely. Plenty of trunk space 
for our luggage.  Smooth ride on

secondary roads.  Plenty of cabin room 
for us to stretch out  4 speed auto 
tranny shifted great.  I like the 
outside buttons on the driver's door, 
in case you lock your keys inside.  
Spare tire is steel full size rim, and 
you can use it when you rotate wheels.  
Remote control from key ring is 
convienient to lock and unlock trunk

that is built to take that type of 
driving.  The cost of maintenance is 
negligible, after having owned a few 
Swedish and German cars it has been a 
very welcome experience.  The car has 
32000 miles on it and has never been

Fuel economy about the same, with more power. Seats are comfortable. Sound system is good. Fuel economy is do-do around town (as these cars have always been so-so) about 18 mpg. On the highway, 26 mpg. Better choice comfort and MPG wise than my old Tahoe."

It has leather interior which gives it a very plush feeling.  We are most appreciative of the large trunk for luggage.  City driving however is hard on gas mileage.

mercury,grand-marquis,2003,Brian, 05/28/2007,"Good, but not great.",4,"I purchased a brand new black '03 Crown Victoria based on reviews by Edmunds, Consumer Reports and J D Power.  About everything they reported has panned out as accurate.  The front bucket seats are extremely comfortable, great for long trips. The rear bench seats lack lateral support. Steering response and tracking are vague which requires more minute corrections to stay on course than in other vehicles I've driven.  The interior is quiet. The gray monochrome leather contrasts nicely with the black paint scheme and the car does not heat-up as much as you would expect in our hot Southern summers. The car will cruise at highway speeds (75-95 mph) with aplomb. Hope to drive her 7-10 years."

also a law enforcement officer and have 
driven the Ford Crown Victoria. They 
have all proven to be safe, reliable 
and a comfortable ride. Those cars I 
used during work took a real beating 
with going over curbs, hours of idling 
with the air conditioner or heater 
runnning and having mileage well into 
the 100,000's. They always continued to 
run well and comfortable not to mention 
the safety factor. (I also was an

Only had one major problem with car. Air flow senser went bad just out of the guarantee.  Autoway was great with getting in touch with Ford/Mercury in getting most of the repair bill paid for me.

mercury,grand-marquis,2003,Brian Nadler, 04/08/2002,Grand Marquis,4,"This vehicle provides a refined quiet
ride.  It is powered by a 4.6 liter
overhead cam v8.  This is the same
engine which powered the Ford
Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar up till
1997.

Being a heavier vehicle Grand Marquis
does not have the same level of pickup
as 8 cylindar Thunderbirds and cougars
of the 1990's.  Performance may be
imporved by added the performance
package with dual exhausts.  

Finally, I would like to see  Mercury
add a Tachometer to the intrumentation. 
This is a very practical way to confirm
the transmission is in overdrive and
visualize low engine rpm at highway
spped."

the road/air noise on the highways.  To 
the point where the radio/ CD are not

me think of another vehicle."
mercury,grand-marquis,2003,Steve Whetstine, 12/01/2005,Great Car!,4,"This is a great car.  It's got plenty of power and can peel rubber even when you have a full load of people-which is six.  Very comfortable and has great visibility. Just a great ""big boat car"" from the seventies.  "
mercury,grand-marquis,2003,Murph, 01/17/2006,best car made in america,5,"great in every category, room, comfort and great road mileage (over 425 miles per tank full) but a bit poor in local driving.  "
mercury,grand-marquis,2003,Mike Elliott, 05/10/2003,Ultimate Grand Marquis,4,"This is an excellent automobile for 
the consumer looking for confort at an 
affordable price. The gas mileage is 
acceptable as it averages about 20 mpg 
on regular fuel and around 28 mpg on 
the highway. It has plenty of power 
for passing and driving in mountains. 
I personally prefer the rear wheel 
drive over frontwheel drive as it 
handles much better. The rear air 
suspension really smooths the ride. It 
is so quiet that the driver hears 
hardly any wind or road noise. The 
only thing I would change are the 
inside door handles. They should be 
chromed metal and not the hard 
plastic, after all this is the 
ultimate Grand Marquis. ."
mercury,grand-marquis,2003,JR1949, 06/28/2003,WOW!!,4,"I went from an '85 Crown Vickie to this 
2003 Grand Marquis LS Convenience. What 
a difference! The '03 handles like a 
car 1000 pounds lighter. The non-air 
suspension offered in this model offers 
just enough ""road-feel"" to make it fun 
to drive. Considering its' size, 
frontal area & mass, the fuel economy 
isn't bad!(22 MPG avg-mixed city/hiway, 
~26 pure hiway) My heart sunk when I 
realized I had left the windows open 
one evening during a moderate rain, yet 
the leather wiped off perfectly.  So 
far, it's about the BEST car overall, 
I've ever owned; I consider it a mini-
Lincoln! Ford-this one's a keeper!"
mercury,grand-marquis,2003,Whitney S, 04/10/2017,"Best for occassional or ""Sunday driving""",4,"I bought this off of my Great Uncle (what a stereotype, but seriously) and it served me well for about 6 years, but after 120k miles the car just went to pieces.  Heat went, $500 fix.  AC went, I didn't bother because they quoted me $500-ish again.  Ignition coils failed on me twice in the first 3 years, another few hundred dollars to fix each time.  Now the intake manifold gasket is wrecked due to leaking antifreeze and made worse with rain (which my mechanic couldn't suss out for months because it wasn't throwing error messages through the machine), which fried one of the cylinders - parts are about $400 alone.  Only 145k miles on it and it is just falling to pieces.  Not to mention since the car is rear-wheel drive, even the barest hint of snow or mud made it slide like crazy.  Even with the best studded tires and weight in the trunk, this car could NOT keep a hold on the road in anything but sunny conditions.  Gas mileage, even mostly highway, wasn't all that great.  Not the worst, but certainly not cheap to keep filled.  It wasn't all bad, though - very smooth drive, lots of punch and power (especially uphill - nobody cut me off!), incredibly, deliciously comfortable seats up front and in back, tons of storage space, and very classy-looking.  It may have an image as a casual, classy ""Grandpa car,"" but it should be a compliment.  The car is comfortable and lively, but has frequent nickel-and-dime repairs and should be kept off the road in bad conditions.

Paid $3900 for it and feel for the car it is I made a good buy. Rides very well even with installing 18inch GT Mustang wheels with 235/50/18 tires. Looks really sweet and rides like a cloud. I wonder why they stopped producing this car.
"
mercury,grand-marquis,2003,Lubener, 04/10/2019,Who says a large sedan can't be enjoyable,5,"Overall, this is a fine vehicle. The ride has been stiffened up for 2003 but the handling and steering has been improved. My Grand Marquis has been very reliable for me.Some weak points are very cramped rear seating which has taken a toll to give you all that trunk space.  The lighting control module has been troublesome for many, resulting in operational issues with the headlights and there was a recall for this. The stereo system is not a great sounding system and could use some upgrading. Gas mileage is decent for a big car. I average around 20 mpg in the city and 25-27 on the highway. These cars sell used at a very low price and are a good value as a used vehicle too. Update, my Grand Marquis continues to provide reliable and enjoyable transportation for me.
"
mercury,grand-marquis,2004,RMO, 01/01/2016,Old school,5,"Great Value. Resale value is low but that is good for buyers looking for dependable transportation.

mercury,grand-marquis,2004,0rnery, 06/03/2013,True Blue American Icon,4,"Full frame, V8 Rear Wheel Drive.
The only configuration I'll ever own.
Been driving Grand Marquis' and Town Cars for over thirty years, and that will be the same till I die.
I work on my own cars and have never purchased new.
These cars are rugged, reliable and cheap & easy to fix.
That's why police departments, taxi companies and rental agencies chose this platform.

Just bought this 2004 Ultimate sixteen months ago with 80K on it, and have not been disappointed.
Got a documented 28MPG on a recent 600 mile trip.
No doubt it will hold up like all my past FOMOCO cruisers.
That means at least 15 more trouble free years in my possession.
Batteries, tires and brakes are no ""trouble""."

The vehicle has been very reliable."
mercury,grand-marquis,2004,topvalueguy, 06/04/2014,Tanklike safety; great handling; very reliable,4,"Got this car used in 2012 with only 24,300 miles on it.
Had an older Lexus GS300 prior to this.
I really like the Panther platform.  These are the tiny issues I had with the car; otherwise, it was great:
I replaced one fuel pump
Electronic Climate Control was out (which I fixed myself with an aftermarket part); cruise control was out, but l left it
Factory CD player died, so replaced with a Pioneer unit
Some of the chrome trim pieces were sun-damaged, so I replaced with store-bought new ones

This car was crashed on the freeway in November 2014. The car was a total loss and I walked away with only a small scrape on my arm where the airbag cover brushed me.  I found another Mercury Grand Marquis the very next day and bought it immediately

mercury,grand-marquis,2004,Tieden, 10/27/2010,Bullet Proof,5,Most under appreciated car on the road today. If your looking for a small neo- hippy car or a glitzy peacock vehicle don't look at the merc. but if you need a to hell and back in comfort and reliability you cannot look anywhere else. I do alot of highway driving and at 70 mph+ I average 31-33.5 mpg depending on AC usage. show me any v8 import lux sedan that gets that mpg and then compare price tags and reliability. this platform is something that should never be discontinued its a mark of American quality. I'm 31 and I get asked why I drive an old man car and I respond because old men know quality and don't have time for less. 
mercury,grand-marquis,2004,Dedrick Brown, 11/07/2009,Best Car and Looks GREAT,5,I always love big cars because I like to get more for my money. I want buy a small car because they do not ride like the Grand Marquis. This car is the best car and everywhere I go people give me compliments on this car. It is very fancy also with a vinly top. Lincoln Town Car I really like but why should I pay more for the same car and motor. I'm a car expert and you are getting your money worth when you buy this car. I also on a Mercedes and a Jeep but they donot ride like the Grand Marquis. I believe every family should at least own one of these cars.

Edition package is what sets it apart 
from everything on the road, with the 
tutone Spruce Green and Gold Ash paint, 
as well as the badging and the hood 
ornament.
The leather is totally comfortable, the 
ride is very smooth, and the car will 
take off like a bullet to get up with 
traffic.  Trunk size is only matched by 
the Town Car, which means there's more 
than enough room to take six people and 
all the luggage they can bring.  Gas 
Mileage averages between 25-30 on the

I am a salesman and this is my fourth Grand Marquis. These cars are the best value on the road today for a large sedan. Good gas mileage, 2004's have a softer ride than 2003's. Mechanically my 1999 was one of the best cars I have ever owned over the past 35 years. Just trouble-free from the beginning and all through my ownership, remained quite with no rattles for 86000 miles.

mercury,grand-marquis,2004,Mercury Guy, 01/22/2018,Better Than Any Foreign Equivalent,5,"Bought my 2004 Ultimate Edition with 68,000 miles on it. I've owned Mercedes, BMW's, Jaguars and Saabs. Needed something with low mileage and a great price. I was able to get both AND a great car. Looks like a boat but it's a wonderful car. Smooth ride and shifting. Quiet. I happen to like big cars. I'm not even a senior citizen! Has a lot of nice touches - turning beacons, nice interior touches, great finish, wonderful suspension. Wish it got better MPG's...15 in the city but much better on the highway...up to 29 mpg's which is amazing for a car this size. Power seats on both sides for the front split bench. Wish it had a console and floor shifter. Steering wheel has a lot of controls on it - cruise control (works great), audio, even temperature and fan control. However, the ""next"" button which goes to your next radio station or CD track only goes one way - up. So, you have to work your way around your saved settings. Has 2 outlets in the front - huge ashtray. Could have used a light there. The dash could have used a little sprucing up rather than some of the basic black plastic. Sound system is good but great. These cars have a tendency to have a bag leak in the rear air suspension. Will eventually take out the bags and put coils - for $250. Easy engine to work on - lots of room to get your hands dirty. Self-dimming rear mirror. Lots of value in this vehicle. Paid $3,500. Low resale value but my guess is I'll have this baby probably for a long time. Really am enjoying this automobile. The only issue I have with it is that the airbags for the rear suspension probably have a slight leak. This causes the compressor to kick in pretty often. I can either replace the airbags or just have springs put in their place. Same ride. It will cause the airbag light to stay on but who cares? Cost for springs is $250 plus labor.

only problem with these cars is wind

think that is great milage. The ride is
wonderful. It manuevers easily in
traffic. I would not get on an
Interstate in any  other car. I feel

However, the ride is not nearly as 
comfortable as the previous two.  I 
even took the car back with less than 
100 miles on it to have the dealer 
check to see if they had mistakenly 
put a ride and handling package on 
this car.  The said it was the 
standard suspension.  I like the looks 
of the car and the performance of the 
engine, but if I were to do it all

ease of handling of a medium sized

powerful enough to pass most of its

powerful. Discovered the GS Special and 
bought it.  I have only had it a few 
days but it is responsive and with the 
special paint and tone leather it is a 
head turner.  On guy asked me if it was 
a new Lexis and I told him it was a

It has aggressive gearing I like to get acceleration, and to be able to do 140 MPH. The ride is great and quiet on the highway, not the best, but up there. This is best bought as a Used vehicle since you get the best deal for the value. I only recommend the Ultimate edition, because this car is not worth the money without all the goodies.

Granted, the cupholder is only just usable and the car could use a bit more storage in the front seat area.  But you know what-I like every other aspect of this car just fine.  I like its heft without being too hefty and I like how it moves.  The rack and pinion steering is precise and the air suspension is great without totally isolating you from road feel. Leather, air ride, quality construction and a good stereo.  For what I paid for a virtually new car with only 22K miles, I could never get a better deal."

The car seems rock solid and has decent fuel mileage for the all city driving I do (19- 20mpg).  It handles like a much smaller car but has the big car ride without being floaty or wallowy.  It is also quite a bargain for a full size car with a V8 engine.  I'd recommend it to those of any age.  I'm not a grandpa even though the car might be considered a ""grandpa car"".  "

The ride is SUPERIOR, and CANNOT be duplicated in a unitized body, front wheel drive car, PERIOD!

mercury,grand-marquis,2005,Jay657, 11/11/2007,Best Value Around!,4,"I am 26 yrs old and I love this car! It's black with black with black heated leather, moonroof, digital dash, rear air shocks. I had a 99 DeVille which was a horrible disappointment. I love the RWD v.s the clumsy FWD DeVille. It handles awesome for a big car. Has enough power, but could use a dual exhaust for a little more. I put dark tinted headlight and corner lenses from the 03-04 Marauder on the Marquis and they look great with the chrome grille. I get compliments where ever I go. These big RWD sedans are getting hard to find, so I am taking extra good care of this one and plan to keep it for a good 5 to 7 years."

mercury,grand-marquis,2005,Ron, 02/28/2009,Easy front seat access,4,"The front passenger seat is easy to enter and exit. This is the main thing I was looking for, since my wife has a physical handicap.  The front doors are high and wide, and hip and head room are excellent. The front bench seat, without a console, is a plus, for the extra legroom.   The leather power seats help getting in and out.  I had considered a van for front seat access, but this car's front seat dimensions were almost as good. "

The car feels solid, powerful, and comfortable. RWD with traction control does well on slick roads during Buffalo, NY winters. I plan on keeping this car for atleast 5 years or more. My only fear is that they will stop making them. "
mercury,grand-marquis,2005,Gary L. Carey, 05/16/2005,Marquis GS Limited,4,"The GS Limited gives a great ride and is a very comfortable car to drive. In the north where we live, the traction control is a very important feature in rainy conditions. We have yet to drive in snowy conditions.The seating is very comfortable and the electric lumbar is fantastic as the wife and I have different requirements. The mpg rating is not very good but we have very few miles as yet so we expect this to improve. The size does create some problems parking, but can be overcome. The steering is excellant and has fast responce. Excelleration is good and the braking is excellant. Interior cabin design is easy to adjust to and is very roomy & comfortable. Trunk size is a plus.

mercury,grand-marquis,2005,Wing Commander, 12/14/2005,Not Your Grandpa's Car!,4,"After putting over 17,000 miles on the odometer in less than six months, I can honestly say that our Mercury Grand Marquis has performed flawlessly. The fuel consumption is excellent for an automobile of this magnitude and has been checked against a GPS for accuracy at extended speeds of 55 to 100 mph.The fact that it is rear wheel drive and fairly evenly balanced attributes to it's beautiful handling characteristics.  Probably one of the reasons that most highway patrol cars are of the same vintage.  Anything less shouldn't even be considered when buying a new car if you keep safety, comfort, and dollar value in mind.  "

made a better car but took a chance 
with Mercury. The Mercury has a good 
ride and leather but handles horribly, 
gets 15 MPG, and is bad quallity. I 
had one mechanical problem after 28,000 
and that's all."
mercury,grand-marquis,2005,Love my Mercury, 06/20/2005,Love my Mercury,4,"This car is hands down the best value for the money on the road. With the rebates and incentives, you can have full size American comfort at a Honda Civic price. The Marquis is powerful, handles and brakes well, and at only 1400 miles, is already getting 22 mpg in combined city and highway driving. The power pedals are a great feature, as is the power lumbar support. I really like the variable assist steering- one finger easy in town, and lots of road feel at highway speeds. The traditional body-on-frame construction seems very solid. I feel safe in this car, which is something I never felt in smaller front-drive cars. I'm a Realtor, and my clients often mistake this car for a Lincoln.  "
mercury,grand-marquis,2005,Phil Little, 11/28/2005,Quality Lacking,4,"This is my umpteenth Ford product that I have purchased new since 1962.  The car performs well, but has a very annoying squeak in the front suspension that the service department hasn't been able to locate and repair.  It would appear that quality was not number one the day my car was built.  I like the ride, the looks of the car, and am happy with the gas mileage which is in keeping with the original sticker quote. My 2004 Marquis was a better built vehicle."
mercury,grand-marquis,2005,Sozo, 03/07/2006,Never again!,3,"Our new 93LS would put this 05 to shame. I thought they'd make the car better, not worse. Too much wind noise (mirrors & windshield) and a noisy low speed  fan. The engine, transmission and exhaust noise is a total disappointment. The dealer said they now use thinner windows.  But besides the overall cheap feel of the car we ended up with steel wheels that are out of round. Yep, shaped like an egg with the vibration and road noise to go with them. I spent my life in the tire business and know tires and wheels. The dealer replaced one wheel but it looks like it will take an act of Congress to get the rest taken care of.  With 7,000 miles were stuck. My wife's Corolla is a much better car."
mercury,grand-marquis,2005,Otis H. Smith, 03/22/2006,Comfort,4,"Ive owned many different types of cars in my 74 years. The Mercury has rear wheel drive, which I prefer over any front drive.  I drive cross country a lot and I need the large trunk.  The V8 engine is strong and smooth and gets decent mileage (18 - 25). Handling is very good for such a large car. Turning radius is a bit high (40 ft or so) which occasionaly complicates parking lot maneuvers a bit. Ride  is very comfortable but the car is not ""wallowy"" and handles curves very well. ( I owned an Infinity G35 before -  the Mercury doesn't handle as well but I don't need a race car.  Couldn't drive like that anyway.)  I'm very satisfied with this car. I'm not decrepit but I don't need a BMW."
mercury,grand-marquis,2005,Log01, 09/16/2006,A real disapointment,2,"I have one good thing to say about the car it does get pretty good gas mileage, I get 19 in town and 28 on the Highway. Other than that it's a real disapointment.  Road noise is excessive. The interior is cheap, the passengers seat rattles, it sounds line the window aren't all rolled up. We won't even go into the ash tray/cup holder pain in the shorts. The passengers in the back see can't see around the head rests, not confortable on long trips, poor real leg room. If you open the trunk lid in the rain the water off the trunk lid drips into the truck. The car is lacks power for a v8. I don't like the car and would like to trade it, but with only 8 thousand miles on it it has lost $20K value"
mercury,grand-marquis,2005,J Armenta, 05/16/2007,Excellent Buy,4,"Have driven this for over 42000 miles and this vehicle has given me pure satisfaction. Although it could have a bit more power, it still delivers on average of 23 mpg. Not bad for its size. Got 27 mpg on the last trip to Michigan, very comfortable to travel in as well."
mercury,grand-marquis,2005,CHIGS, 05/04/2007,Highly Pleased,5,"The Grand Marquis is a great experience. It has great acceleration and will pass anything on the highway while riding in luxury.

However, the ride quality has been slowly deteriorating ever since day one. The amount of wind noise makes normal conversation difficult. Rear passengers almost need a kidney belt due to the stiff ride. The dealership says both problems are normal. How do they justify that it keeps getting worse then. I had beaters in college that rode better. I've owned one in the past and also own a Mercury Cougar. Neither had these problems.

It feels solid, secure, stable, and is a pleasure to drive on longer trips.  Easy entry and egress for those with medical problems.  Trunk is huge and deep, but the liftover height is too high.  The spare tire is far back and hard to reach.  Mileage is much better than I expected for this size and weight vehicle.  Car starts and runs flawlessly in all kinds of weather.  I also test drove a Lincoln Town Car and could not discern any difference, except in the substantially higher price fot the Town Car.

Recently when my 05 Expedition gave it up with only 80K miles on it, due to the POS Triton v8 engine,I decided not to give Ford new car money for awhile (at least until the new Bronco comes out : ). So I started searching for a used Mercury Grand Marquis and I hit the jackpot, an '05 Utimate with a digital dash and alloy rims, perfect leather and paint, garaged with 35K miles on it. It needed a new set of tires all around and what a difference that made for the ride. I added a performance intake and a touch screen bluetooth radio and backup camera. At first they laughed at me, now even my 16 year old daughter says she likes the car and wants it. 2 years on it has 56K miles on it and I only changed the fuel filter, and oil (of course) and I get stopped all the time by people who say it's a great car, I tell my wife those are people who know cars and can appreciate this beauty.

No space to store ""stuff"", cell phone, cds, etc. Lousy, lousy interior noise-at interstate speeds the noise is very annoying. Great mileage considering size of car. No problems to report other than lousy interior noise. Two Ford dealers have been given opportunity to correct noise problem--both have failed, in fact, I dont think they knew how to fix problem. Will not consider buying another Mercury or Ford product until noise levels have drasticall been improved. One dealer told me the Michelin tires could be the culprit. Pay $700 to $800 for new tires and problem could be resolved. Should have bought Honda or Toyota"
mercury,grand-marquis,2005,Everette B. Brown, S,Grand Marquis 2005 Body Change,2,"We are very unhappy with the design of the 2005 Grand Marquis.  There is a lot of road noise and wind noise around the windows.  The ride is not nearly as comfortable as the older models.  We have a 98 that is much more comfortable and has less road and wind noise than the 2005.  We will not purchase another New Mercury Grand Marquis until some major changes have been made. We are hoping the Ford Motor Co. will buy this vehicle back and allow us to purchase another Vehicle.  We travel back and forth to see our grandchildren and the 2005 makes it a very long 350 miles.

We experience less outside noise than the previous car. The ride is quite smooth although rough roads have a little bumpiness to the ride but certainly within acceptable limits. The compass over the rear view mirror has saved many tempers and the garage door opener is very handy. The leather seats are very nice but take a little getting used to.

Purchased used in 2012 with 71,000 miles on the odo, and all I've had to do is routine maintenance and replace the tires.  This car delivers 28 mpg highway while holding 75 mph with the a/c blasting, all day, every day.  The interior is huge, the trunk swallows up tons of luggage or whatever you need to carry, and the leather seats are very comfortable, especially on long trips.  This is my work car.  It sits outside at night, and bakes in the parking lot at work during the day.  I wash and wax the exterior twice a year, and there are no signs of wear or fading anywhere on this vehicle.  You don't have to baby or pamper this cruiser, just stick to the maintenance schedule and this car will deliver safety, reliability, and comfort.      
"
mercury,grand-marquis,2006,G A, 09/10/2015,Fools for ending this vehicle!,4,"Buy it.  Grab one now!  Spacious, GREAT smooth ride, ok performance, super inexpensive to buy, maintain, repair and insure.  It's no sports car, it's certainly no gas miser Prius (12 dense traffic, 16 mix, 23 highway @ 80mph), but if you want a comfortable, roomy, low cost per mile ride this is it.  

The interior materials are not high quality but are serviceable.  The trunk is good old American sedan huge and the car seats five comfortably, six in a pinch.  The rear air suspension does a great job of keeping the car level when loaded.   The handling is not as bad as some write ups would have you believe.  It's open differential RWD without stability control.  If you don't have a reasonable understanding of physics, go find a modern nanny-mobile to do the driving for you.

You can drive over pot holes without worrying about blowing a tire or knocking the front end out of line.  It's much more forgiving than a modern FWD with weenie low profile tires.  Personally, I got tired of replacing tires and wheels during winter driving.  2006 and newer models share a solid 4 speed transmission with the F150 pickup truck.  This is a solid vehicle.

Reliability is one of the best and even beats a lot of Japanese luxury cars as noted by consumer reports and JD Power surveys. Highway cruising is the way it should be. Beats SUV and most crossovers for mileage and mine has traction control for winter driving ( I don't really need 4 wheel drive on paved roads). I bought it used very cheap because no one wants a v8 right now. Great choice for the used car buyer! Everyone thinks it's a geezer car (I'm only 42 and perfect for my family).

The '06 is my 2nd one, the other was a '98.The stiffer chassis and rack and pinion steering on the newer models create a more satisfying driving experience. The car is floaty and large, but I am on the road six days a week, and cover about 4,000 miles a month. This car is my office and home away from home. I bought is certified pre-owned for almost nothing, as depreciation is poor on these cars. Never would I have bought one new, but is it a huge bargain used. I had a Chrysler 300C.

mercury,grand-marquis,2006,FRANK, 07/06/2006,Excellent big V8 value,4,"My satisfaction with a 1994 ford crown victoria I purchased new, drew me back to my looking at the Mercury. The excellent value for the money of a quality auto ruled out considering the Chrysler big cars and the Toyota and Honda offerings as well as the Chevrolet big car. The comfort and room are worth the small trade off in gas mileage, plus the safety of a bigger car. The wide choices of options allowed not having to pay for unwanted and needless ones. Only one small service shop item, failure of keyless door pad which was repaired at no charge. The standard features and overall attention to detail shows that from my 1995 crown vic, to my present 2006 grand marquis, quality is first class."

mercury,grand-marquis,2006,william anderson, 01/12/2006,Bill Anderson's Grand Marquis (2006),4,"This is a luxury car that is value priced. It is a very safe vehicle with very low insurence rates. The car has a lot of room, and is great for long drives it is very spacious, and you can travel in total comfort. this car has all of the luxury you would want at an axceptional price."
mercury,grand-marquis,2006,Dan G., 07/15/2006,Suprised!,4,"Got a good deal on a Limited. 1st car in 20 yrs. Very pleased with comfort, quality and economy. Avg. 22+ and over 28 mpg on long trips. Leather seats need to wrap around more to hold you while cornering. Needs more storage in cabin. Has a tendency to react to ruts in the road. My needs changed after 20 years in F250's & 350's. I was looking for normal more comfortable transportation. Since I truly had no clue what I wanted I was overwhelmed with choices. Nothing really  excited me so I figured keep it simple. This car meet all my needs without being gaudy or looking like a jelly bean. In retrospect it's more car than I ever imagined for under 25K! "
mercury,grand-marquis,2006,Joseph Santiago, 12/18/2015,Family's delight,5,"We have 109k on this thing and the only thing that's happened is 2 overheats. The ride is smooth, the engine sounds awesome, fuel mileage is nothing to write home about, but what can you expect from a V8? It's very cheap to maintain. We drive anywhere from around town to across states, and it's fun and easy to drive either.
"
mercury,grand-marquis,2006,mm, 04/03/2008,The Grand,5,"Bought this 06 LS to replace a V6 Chevy. The Merc has such comfy leather seats, big roomy interior and a huge trunk. This car is so quiet that when I test drove it I thought the engine wasn't even running when I stopped at a red light. On the highway mpg is about 25-28 which is remarkable for a big car. The design is old school but safety played another important role in buying this car as its RWD and full frame instead of unibody. Most people call these granny cars, but I like the style and comfort, plus it gets me where I'm going safely and with my factory chrome-plated rims it shows a bit of flair too."

mercury,grand-marquis,2006,B. Haworth, 02/27/2006,Disappointed in new Mercury,3,"I bought a new Mercury Grand Marquis Premium LS about 2 weeks ago. I had it up to Interstate speed earlier this week and discovered that the wind and tire noise are horrible. It is so loud that it drowns out the radio. I took it back to the dealer who claims to have test drove it along with another new Mercury. He claimed the other new car noise was as loud or louder than my car. His conclusion was that the noise was a design flaw and there was nothing he could do. I have a hard time believing Mercury would manufacture a vehicle with this much driving noise, but apparently they did. I cannot and will not recommend this vehicle to anyone. "
mercury,grand-marquis,2006,nveragain, 04/24/2013,beware....its a ford,2,"purchased the car in 2007 with 10K miles on it.
after 2 years, the ""blend"" apparatus required replacement.
( this is the little door that opens and closes to give you cool or warm air.)
that was a 1K repair and after 2 attempts, have still not succeeded in putting the dash back together correctly.
today I learned that one of fords most reliable models requires a new intake manifold.
this vehicle has 92K miles on it.
have read many forums about this problem however this was supposed to have been corrected in 2005. NOT!!
so if you're planning on purchasing a ford or mercury with a 4.6L this will cost you around 1200.
will be going back to Honda later this year......"
mercury,grand-marquis,2006,Barb, 04/03/2007,Comfort,3,"We traded our Park Ave for this car. I find that the seat was made for a tall person it is way too deep for the average person. Your legs rub on the edge of the seat. This makes it very uncomfortable. There is not enough storage inside. Plus the trunk is too deep when pulling out heavey luggage. For a big car it has less room in the back seat then the even the Park Ave. Also the Buick is much quiter inside and has a better sounding radio. Between the two, wish I had bought Buick"
mercury,grand-marquis,2006,Joe Woelfel, 10/29/2008,Mixed bag,3,The exterior styling and colors were very nice. I would choose something other than a light color interior. It shows low mileage wear badly. Great performance. Mediocre mileage both highway and city. Lots of road noise in the interior.

The only thing I did not like about the rental were the too soft seats.  Got a great deal on this GS w leather and like it better than the LS I took to Colorado.  It is very manuverable for its size.  Its easy to get in and out of and dont believe everything you read in Consumer Reports...I get 27 to 28 mpg on the highway.  You drive it like a moron and you'll pay for it at the pump just like any other vehicle.  And no, the Chrysler 300 is not a better or roomier vehicle.  My car is much quieter, roomier, easier ingress and egress and MUCH better  visibility.  "

mercury,grand-marquis,2006,duke, 06/16/2006,Smooth Ride,5,The auto handles well and gets good milage on the open road. It is stylish. If I had to find one fault I would say it could use better soundproofing. There is high road noise from cabin.

mercury,grand-marquis,2006,T Barber, 12/28/2006,Great car for the money,4,"Car is comfy, but seats need more support. Car runs really well for the size of car & engine. Transmission seems to always be ""in the zone"" with very good 1st gear power and ready willingness to downshift to appropriate gear when passing. Mileage is very good at 27-28 hwy, 16-17 around town. The tach is a good addition. Car steers and handles very well for being over 2 tons."

Sure, the styling is dated (or is that ""classic""?), but the room, ride and overall quality cannot be matched for under $25k."

mercury,grand-marquis,2006,jlg, 07/02/2006,Big Car - Big Value,4,The gas mileage is amazing for the size of car. Overall the drive is quiet. Roomy is the key word of this car!  The seats could use a bit more redesign as they tend to be a bit low to the floor.

Handled well on trip from Phx to Las Vegas after I drove 500+ local miles first.  Did not realize I was doing 98 mph on the way up.  The ride was flawless and handled the road and curves very well.  The turning radius is excellent for such a large car and like the other comments fuel consumption is better than stated.  I found it to be the best value for the large car market.  Luxury w/o the price tag.   People think this is your Dad's / Granddad's type car, but once they get into it they love it!!  Big and roomy."

Instead, I have a 4,200 pound modern day buckboard. This car's suspension is very unforgiving and downright hard riding. If you must purchase one of these cars, be careful, and don't buy one with the optional ""handling package"" ($615.00), because the suspension will be set up whereby you will feel every little blemish in the road surface. And also, the $895.00 ""Premium Plus Audio Package"" is a waste of money, since the rear speakers distort and rattle, but the dealer insists that this is normal. Need I say, this is my very last purchase of a Ford product....ever."

The leather is cheap, the quality is no Toyota Avalon, It looks like junk, It is junk, it makes KIA look nice! The seats have no support and there is no rear leg room.  The Mercury is great if live in the 1940.  For the same price buy: Toyota Avalon For less buy: Honda Accord For more buy: Lexus or Linclon "
mercury,grand-marquis,2006,mongo, 10/15/2007,This is a Sedan,4,"I have had this model for 15 months and it is still in the ""teething"" stage because of the low miles. So far, there have not been any major problems with this unit and rather enjoy the road-boat. I can zip-zip thru traffic, room permitting, as if I were in a coupe and not a full-sized sedan. The style is quite nice but rather chintzy on the inside and outside trim. The trunk space is partially taken up by a full-sized spare and think a smaller spare would be adequate. The gas mpg is rather low but will wait for the engine other components to ""seat-in"" and then see what the mpg will be with more miles on this car. "
mercury,grand-marquis,2006,marquislover, 08/09/2007,Fun to drive,4,"Even though the Marquis is viewed as an old-school car, it is fun to drive. Handles well around corners, stops on a dime (for a big car!) And give you a sense of safety. Currently getting 23- 25mpg, and room enough for 5-6 people. Ok 4 heavy ones! I am so pleased. Does Detroit think that size doesnt matter? Big cars rule! Look at the number of SUVs on the road. I want a car and the marquis is the only one that fits the bill!  Thanks Mercury-never touch it! "
mercury,grand-marquis,2006,Martin, 11/06/2007,Pretty good so far,4,"This is my first Grand Marquis and I have owned it for 14 months. I primary use it for work and recreational driving on the weekends. I have put on 31,000 miles and it's been pretty reliable so far.  I get about 21-22mpg doing both city and highway driving.  I think it handles pretty well for such a big car.  The traction control came in handy in the snow."
mercury,grand-marquis,2006,Grand Marquis Fan, 06/25/2020,Super roomy and lasts forever,5,"This is a fantastic car.  I have owned it since 2007, when I purchased it with about 16,000 miles on it (it had been part of a rental fleet).  It now ias 310,000+ miles on it.  I have done all the routine maintenance such as oil changes and tire rotations, while skipping suggested engine and trans flushes, and it hasn't cost much to fix things that have gone wrong over the years.  There wa a steering column recall (in 2014 I believe) and I had that fixed, and it helped a lot in terms of turning smoothly.

mercury,grand-marquis,2007,Venuswymn, 10/09/2006,Grand Marquis GS/Best Buy for the Money,4,"The 2007 Mercury Grand Marquis GS is definitely the best buy for the money on the market.  It's roomy, comfortable, reliable and affordable.  The styling may seem outdated to folks who are trendy but hey...why change something that is already the best.  Just as much room as a Cadillac DTS but much more economical to buy and to maintain.  Some of the bells and whistles that the LS has are not there but those few things aren't worth the extra cost...unless you don't know what else to do with your money.  I love my Grand Marquis!!!"
mercury,grand-marquis,2007,Paul, 02/14/2010,"A solid, traditional, reliable car",4,"I find the official review from Edmunds a bit irresponsible! I fail to see the logic in urging folks not to want a so- called ""throwback"" of a car when the Grand Marquis is a solid, reliable US/Canadian vehicle that gets the job done in comfort and safety. Competitor cars have iffy build quality are costly to repair. Does Edmunds want us to pay more for something ""new"" just because newness is somehow better? I disagree! I have a 2008 BMW 5 series too and the iDrive is a mess, the dopey flipper shift knob gets in the way, parts break often and it's back to the $$$hop; it's constantly nagging at me too! A lousy personality I pay a fortune for. I'll take the familiar, old school Ford V8 anyday."
mercury,grand-marquis,2007,ripdaddy, 11/03/2013,A real surprise,4,"I was looking for a Crown Vic to pull my small bass boat with when this 2007 GM got in the way.
6 years old, 44000 miles, body on frame to handle a trailer hitch, $9500.00?
Oh, yeah.
I was expecting a somewhat clumsy driving experience.
Boy, was I wrong!
The suspension is tight and well controlled.
The steering is
precise and so smooth, too.
I love driving it!
I don't drive with a heavy foot so my worst mpg average for a tank of gas has been 24.6 with about a 40/60 city to highway ratio.
A 300 mile highway trip yielded 28.1 mpg.
The car is so nice I don't want to put the hitch on it.
I feel like I got a new car for 9500 bucks.
There are several like it out there, too."

People seem to want to talk about how it has a lack of handling with some roll in the corners or how it should look more sporty or its lack of power. This is a large semi luxury vehicle, it's not a race car. This is a great road car and when buying a nice comfortable vehicle these points are mute. If you want a sporty suspension with more power then doin't buy it, but if you want a vehicle that delivers a good ride, decent fuel economy (for it's size at 25 mpg highway) and plenty of room for the family at a reasonable price then this is the car for you. "
mercury,grand-marquis,2007,Eric Andersen, 12/25/2015,Its a Lincoln Town Car for 20k less.,3,"Purchased car new. My second one . I also owned two Ford Crown Vics basically the same car.
 Outside of car is rather large .Front interior room above average, shockingly little leg room in back. Adequate head room for taller drivers. Very comfortable seats has lumbar adjustment.Pleasant interior.Smooth ride. Odd that it has a tachometer for this is not a performance car.Plenty of front leg room, adjustable steering wheel nice.Easy to get in and out. Easy to operate power windows and power seats.Awful electronic digital odometer that I can't read in bright light . Perfect for long trips but dangerous on wet and icy roads for it has rear wheel drive and will easily lose traction,so I don't recommend for anyone living in the snowbelt.
 Appearance of car is pleasant ,looks like a Lincoln Town car and has the same V8 engine which gives plenty of passing power basically a Lincoln Town car for a lot less money. Huge trunk !They  improved the handling in 2003 .Try to find one without  those awful rear suspension airbags that would leak.Electronic throttle stuck
 cost $550 to replace.The ENTIRE AC went out compressor,actuator,blower wheel and dash board  switch cost $2,200, common problem this year.1995 through 
2001 have plastic intake manifold that cracks cost $800+ to fix.The engine will last 300k if you change oil.No transmission problems.Poor trade in value but overall are an inexpensive used car .Try to buy one from an older person who maintained car.Many used as police and taxes avoid those for they tend to have over 200k and are usually worn out.
The early Mercury Grand Marquis had a plastic intake manifold that would crack and overheat so look for a latter model with aluminum intake.
Gas Mileage is just fair ,especially bad around town.
Engine and transmission smooth and reliable,ZERO problems !!! 
 The electronic gas pedal stuck a very dangerous situation ,it cost $600 to get it repaired. Even more expensive the entire AC went out at 35k first the AC compressor went out then the actuator that opens and closes the doors switching from AC to heat. Then the fan blower starting howling followed by the dash switch shorting out. It cost over 2 grand to repair. I live in Scottsdale, Arizona so you have to have AC.I owned a 2000 Mercury Grand Marquis and NEVER HAD any AC problems.
 This is the type of car people either love or hate for it is so large and is an old fashioned design. I mostly bought car for it is easy to drive  and the engines and transmissions in these cars go over 200k.I am 6'3 and 250 pounds and this car is easy to get in and out. Most modern cars are super small inside and I have trouble getting in and out. I do a lot of long highway driving and this car is perfect for that.Not very nimble in traffic.Large outer body by today's standards,sits low compared to all these SUV's and crossovers so you can't see over the other cars.Adequate acceleration.
The center caps on the wheel covers keep popping off,I lost three of them.Really cheap wheel covers on the GS model.I noticed on other Grand Marquis they are always missing center caps,it you hit a pot hole they  will fly off.The LS model has nice aluminum wheels so this is not an issue.The LS model comes with leather seats not recommend in hot climates like Arizona.The cloth seats in the GS model are nice looking and never seem to wear out.
 Tires don't last long on these cars for they are heavy cars,expensive to replace,they wear out at 25k. Because these are heavy vehicles  make sure when buying a hydraulic jack that it is rated at 2 and quarter tons or higher.Most of these modern day hydraulic jacks are listed at only two ton,these will fail if you try to jack up the front of the car.
 Visibility is great.These cars will easily last over 200k if you change the oil and transmission fluid,some go over 300k so if you are looking for durability this is the car for you.I
 have owned several Fords including the Crown Vic which is very similar to the Grand Marquis.Most Fords products  are very average cars but this model holds up well,far better than the  pre 2010 GM models I owned. These make great used cars but check out the history of the car before buying,many of these started out life as a police car or a cab,so it may have a zillion miles on it.A lot of elderly people bought these things new ,if you can purchase one from them it will usually have low miles ,these cars will give you years of trouble free driving and are reasonably priced.

mercury,grand-marquis,2007,BARRI, 12/20/2008,More than happy,4,"I bought my Marquis slightly used and at a huge discount. This car does everything right with a giant sized trunk, 6 passenger capacity and 21 mpg on average. Reliability has been perfect so far and I certainly appreciate the super low insurance rates. Being larger than average, the interior room is excellent and the safety rating is reassuring. This may be close to the last car I'll ever buy and I'm only 42. I hear all the stories about sloppy handling. Those people should get a Corvette. This car is designed for cruising and does so very well. This is basically a lincoln town car with a $25,000 rebate. All those cops, taxicab drivers and government employees can't be wrong."
mercury,grand-marquis,2007,Kyle , 02/04/2007,Awesome Family Car,4,The Grand Marquis is the best car on the market for the money Its roomy quiet and has a smooth ride and hugs the road and has great safety ratings which is the most important thing when you are carrying around 2 little ones and the LS Handling Package is great with the improved ride and power And the Laminated Window Glass in the Doors makes you feel extra safe and provides a even more quiet ride And the Dark Toreador Red Paint and Black Leather seats make the car look even better the adjustable foot pedals makes all size drivers comfortable and the power moon roof is a great feature and the remote starter and headlight controls are a must have so in my opinion the Grand Marquis is awesome...

mercury,grand-marquis,2007,Ken, 11/01/2006,More than I expected,5,"On some trips, I and my passengers have all raved about the comfort.  The lumbar cushion in the front seats have given wonderful support.  I have the optional handling package which gives and extremely stable and smooth ride.  I also ordered the laminated security side glass which not only offers protection, but also adds sound insulation from road noise.  It's nice and quiet.  The optional Audiophile Sound System is one of the best sounding radios I've ever heard.  I love being able to adjust the sound and temperature using the controls on the wood and leather steering wheel. This is a wonderful car."
mercury,grand-marquis,2007,Dieter, 12/08/2009,Excellent Car,4,"Silky smooth and fuel efficient engine.  I get 20.5 in town around Boston and as high as 27 on the highway.  Looked at BMW's, but they do not offer a proportionately better handling or ride for the value, plus they burn expensive premium gas.  I still can't find a better car for the price. I put heavy sway bars on the car (rear end) for a couple of hundred dollars.  Big difference. Suspension mods are easy and cheap.  Car's design inside and out is simple, and uncluttered...  but I like that.  Only complaint, is that the rear seat does not fold down, and they don't make a roof rack."
mercury,grand-marquis,2007,Chucktee1, 11/05/2010,Perrenial Winner Grand Marquis,4,"This is my fourth Grand Marquis and I've averaged around 200,000 miles on the previous three. The reason that these Ford/Mercury autos are used for livery and police cars is comfort, fuel economy, longevity and value. Buy Japanese, or German instead?  I think not. Generally my experience is relatively negative to foreign autos contrary to published opinion. My 1998 GM repair bill was under $3,000 for eight years of use while I averaged 25 miles per gallon on the highway. Everyone loves the room and comfort of these autos on a long trip. You could buy smaller and perhaps average another 15% better gas mileage but the repair bill could easily reach 300% more, relative to my experience. "
mercury,grand-marquis,2007,biglinc1, 04/30/2013,Lincoln in Disguise,5,"I purchased a 2007 Grand Marquis LS a few months back to replace an '03 Town Car.

The MPG is between 23-25, and some of the mid-size cars won't average much over that.
I have plenty of leg room, and a huge trunk that you don't find on the smaller cars.
It's as smooth as my Lincoln, and just as quiet.
Would like to have had the redundant audio and HVAC controls on the steering wheel as the radio is a bit of a stretch for the driver. That was an option on the Grand Marquis but standard on the Town Car and Crown Vic LX."

Having had both GS and an LS, I say there is something different about the seats, the leather seems more supportive and not as ""squishy"" as the cloth when driving.  I would like to move up to the Town Car next time, if they still make them. The gas mileage for my 70%city 30%interstate, yields me about 20 mpg, not bad at all for stop and go. On a long road trip I've experienced 26 mpg. If you liked the big sedans when you were a kid get one of these before they're gone. "

mercury,grand-marquis,2007,upset-grandma, 04/08/2009,Very Disappointed,1,"Very disappointed with the quality vs. value.  Wanted to get rid of it within 2 months, but now very upside down on loan (because a lousy quality vehicle) and now have to keep until loan is paid down!  Which makes me dislike it more!  Outside too big, inside too small, ride is very rough.  Just stuck with a lousy car that I don't enjoy driving! The only positive thing about the car, it's been dependable.  But so have my other cars, which makes us regret the day we bought this car.  No wonder the car companies are going bankrupt, the quality is not worth what they're charging.  As soon as it's driven away, it immediately drops in value $10,000??  But the new ones are still priced at $27,000??"
mercury,grand-marquis,2007,Boston Girl, 06/02/2008,2nd Marquis,4,I had already owned a Grand Marquis and was looking for a new car. I test drove a Chevy Impala and Ford Fusion. I bought another Marquis because the price and ride was great and I know that it won't need a lot of future repairs. I wish it was sporty looking instead of a grampa car.
mercury,grand-marquis,2007,J Forman, 08/27/2008,Great Car For The Money,4,"Owned a 1996 Lincoln town car prior to purchasing the Marquis. Was going to get another but took test ride in Mercury and said ""this is it"".So far this is as good of an automoble as you could want. Extremly comfortable excellent gas mileage.Averaged 26 mpg on two trips in excess of 1500 miles at 70 mph. Performs just as good as the Lincoln, plus cost $20,000 less at purchase. Great machine."
mercury,grand-marquis,2007,wpd8458, 02/11/2007,Best large car for the money,4,"I have just traded my 2006 Toyota Highlander in for a 2007 Mercury Grand Marquis LS.  Pound for pound, dollar for dollar, this is the best large vehicle around.  Comfort and space combined with tasteful styling make this car a great buy.  It is like driving on a cloud."
mercury,grand-marquis,2007,mnmyummo, 04/24/2007,mini-me4,3,"The Grand Marquis I bought was smooth and quiet. The V8 though was noisy, effortless, and sometimes felt ungainly. But the cabin felt comfy, despite the unsupported front seat. The trunk was quite cavernous. Sometimes, though, the vehicle tilts when cornering at higher speeds, such as 30-40 mph, but overall the ride seemed stable and supple. All in all, the Grand Marquis is a comfortable touring car, but I do think better cars exist in its class."
mercury,grand-marquis,2007,rich, 07/01/2007,"Great car, good deal",4,"This much maligned vehicle is a real gem. After owning large GM cars, mostly Cadillac, for the past 25 years it is a relief to have something reasonably simple again, to not be plagued by troublesome electronics you dont want or need. This car performs well under a variety of driving conditions. It is comfortable, can actually accommodate six adults when necessary, and still deliver 27 to 29 mpg on regular gas on a trip. The build quality is as good as any I have ever owned. There is little to not like about this car."
mercury,grand-marquis,2007,Webbmeister, 10/01/2007,Wonderful Slightly Used Luxury Car Value,4,"I have owned one Crown Victoria and one Grand Marquis over the past 14 years. these cars were reliable, quiet, powerful, and comfortable. In fact, the 2000 MGM I just retired (still in the driveway - still runs great!) has 215,000 miles on it. That car was driven over 100,000 miles after the car payments ended, and needed nothing more than regular maintenance and replacement of wear items. I expect the same from the 2007 just purchased. This car's initial drop in value makes riding in luxury delightfully inexpensive. It was put into service as a Ford program car 9 months and 7000 miles ago. I paid $17,000 for it, a $13,000 drop from MSRP. If not for the odometer you'd think it was brand new."
mercury,grand-marquis,2007,Great Car!!!, 03/12/2008,Great Car - Very underrated,4,"Just purchased this car 2 weeks ago. Reluctantly traded in a 2005 Mustang with only 26K. But my Grand Marquis is everything I hoped for and more. It's comfortable, holds the road well, incredibly safe and it gets 19-20 MPG in a blend of around town and limited parkway. This is the same mpg my V6 Mustang was getting. The kids have plenty of room and we're even taking my car instead of our gas guzzling TrailBlazer. No one wanted to ride in the Mustang.  There's a lot to be said for big American cars, especially when an Accord or Camry are 1/2 the size and may get 2 or 3 miles better (with a 4 cylinder).  Finally, this was a Ford Company car with 10,800 miles and I paid just under $15K!"
mercury,grand-marquis,2007,jsilvey, 04/16/2008,Great cruiser,4,"Love this car. 42 years old, 3 kids. Comfy as any car I have owned - and I usually buy a car ever 12 months. Very low ownership cost, reliable, dependable, handles anything I can throw at it. Same basic drivetrain and build as police cars - built to withstand abuse. Large, safe, and anyone can work on it. Body on frame is a cheap fix in case of an accident. Runs alternative fuel - E85, reduces greenhouse gasses by 25%. Great way to start driving capital towards alternative fuel infrastructure while supporting American workers. Great car for return-on-investment folks - purchase one that has taken a little depreciation and you can own it cheap and have no large long-term ownership costs. "
mercury,grand-marquis,2007,gd9704, 05/19/2008,Best Automotive Value--Period!,4,"Let's start by pointing out I'm not your typical Grand Marquis buyer--I just turned 39 years old. My 8 year old Chyrsler 300M needed to be replaced and frankly, nothing out there really excited me--unless it cost $30k or more.  I've always liked the look of Grand Marquis. They are a car-plain and simple. I found a nice silver '07 with leather and 16,000 miles on the clock for less than $16k. The ride is super-smooth, and the mileage is surprisingly good- combined city/highway of 22-24mpg. About the same as the 300m gave me. Some of my friends are giving me grief, but I'm laughing all the way to the bank. Pound for pound, these cars are a steal!"

mercury,grand-marquis,2007,John in Georgia, 12/06/2019,Good old school car,4,"I have owned my 07 Grand Marquis for almost ten years.  My fourth Grand Marquis.  Bought used with 30000 miles now has 103000.  Still running like new.  Comfortable and decent gas mileage for large V8 car.  Only engine trouble is at 87,000 intake manifold gasket leaked I opted for new manifold and replaced the original spark plugs at that time $800.  Transmission still works perfectly.  I have been thinking about getting something newer (if they still made these I would probably buy one).  After reading reviews on some of the newer cars transmission and engine problems. I am at a loss on what to choose.  My wife says keep this one til the wheels fall off.  It doesn't owe me anything probably go another 100,000.  Been thinking of going Toyota Hybrid, not that I am an environmental wacko , but just like the concept.  
"
mercury,grand-marquis,2008,jim5660, 06/19/2013,Great Car,5,"Most of the reviews on the car are positive. However,if you read the Edmunds review, it sounds like this car belongs in the 19th century. What is the purpose of a car? To get one from point A to point B safely, comfortably, and reasonably economically. The Grand Marquis does all of this very well. I get 27 MPG on the highway and average 23 around town. I drive it conservatively. I'm tired of Edmunds and others running down these cars in favor of more sporty handling vehicles that corner better. What the heck do you need that for? As for interior space, the claim that the Sable is just as big is just not true. The Sable is 6"" narrower.
Maybe the 'experts' need to reassess a cars purpose."
mercury,grand-marquis,2008,sadchevyowner, 09/10/2011,Wonderful car!!,5,"My wife and I love her 2008 Mercury Grand Marquis ""Palm Beach"" edition.

We purchased her Grand Marquis 14 months ago.
It had 15700 miles.

My wife had been driving a 2006 Lexus ES330 that was purchased new.
It only had 18000 miles when we sold it.
In many ways the Lexus was nice, but it had very uncomfortable seats.

The Grand Marquis has exceedingly comfortable seats with lumbar support on both sides.
Her Mercury also has the air suspension system and it rides like a dream.


We would highly recommend this car.
It is really a shame that it is no longer available as a new car, so my advice would be to find a low mileage late model Grand Marquis"
mercury,grand-marquis,2008,Tom Stipp, 04/22/2010,2008 Mercury Grand Marquis LS,5,"Having owned and driven many late model cars, my 2008 Grand Marquis is one of the very best.Fuel mileage in the upper 20's hwy, extremely comfortable and roomy, excellent reliability, award winning safety record many years in a row. The so called experts would have you believe the body style is outdated and recommends buying one of the newer more up to date not so safe and not very comfortable boxie vehicles on the market they say is more stylish. Had you rather be in a not so safe stylish one or one that has won safety records years in a row if involved in a serious crash which could happen to anyone at anytime? I will stick to my Merc, its a great car."
mercury,grand-marquis,2008,John Kline , 10/12/2007,Extremely Satisfied in Montgomery AL,5,"I had a Crown Vic with 200K miles and never spent a dime except on regular maintenance, tires and brakes, so I bought the Grand Marquis LS and get 27 miles per gallon on the road at 65-75 mph.  Rides great.  Wonderful buy for the money.  Accelerates very well, handles well and sits very comfortable  Tried the Sable, but easily made the choice.  Certainly a wonderful car; could not be more pleased,  I like its design, even if it is more than a decade old.  I am a young 68 years old who works out two hours a day, works a 12 hour day and enjoys life.  This is a car for a person with the maturity and self confidence to handle it--a person who can afford to pay more, but chooses not to.  "
mercury,grand-marquis,2008,Robert, 10/01/2010,Really nice car,4,Most driving is around town. A very comfortable city ride over railroad tracks and street bumps and the many turns made at intersections.

The marquis is safe, priced right, comfortable to ride in, handles the road very well. A few years back, I hit an ice slick and collided with a delivery truck--the solid constriction of the grand marquis-saved my life!"
mercury,grand-marquis,2008,joe maxwell, 05/09/2009,Great Value,5,This car has surprising power with good fuel economy.  Great auto for long trips.  I understand why so many police organizations drive the Crown Vic or the Marquis.

The stying is old but it's simple you don't have to go to school to learn all the gadgets. All in all it's a great dependable car"

Replaced with newest, expensive Fomoco platnum, gold plugs:  22 mpg!  If I could go in the garbage and get my old plugs back, I would. Just turned 200,000 miles. Still rides well  The car has asked me for nothing in terms of repair. Okay, idler arm and a ball joint. I always use Mobil 1. I can't get rid of the car because it still runs so well. I use Michelan Symetry tires (pricey, but oh what a great ride). Got to say that I really like my '93 Gran Marquis."
mercury,grand-marquis,2008,ionosphere, 09/15/2008,Last of a dying breed,4,"I've had my car for 6 months now and I love it. Others can complain that this car is old fashioned, but I'll take this car anyday over any Honda, Toyota, etc. The front bench type seat leaves this big fella with terrific legroom unmatched in other cars. The trunk is great, with the trunk organizer and all the space. Okay, so it's not the greatest in handling around sharp turns and staying in lane. Big deal; I'm not going to race it."
mercury,grand-marquis,2008,Bobby, 09/25/2008,Wonderful Car!,4,"The 2008 Grand Marquis is a fantastic vehicle. I love the exterior design and chrome. It's classy and classic. This car is a great ride, and it's price is not bad. It is smooth on the road, and it is powerful enough for all driving situations. When looking for a full-size car, check out the Grand Marquis. It's worth it."
mercury,grand-marquis,2008,Tip of Texas, 12/18/2008,The way it should be,4,"Before I bought my MGM, I test drove the baseline models of Lexus, Infinity, Cadillac, Jaguar and tried to test drive the Mercedes C300. They all felt the same and very much looked the same. Have to look close before I can tell them appart. Because of my job, I drive into Mexico every day; I need comfortable; feeling the road is not really desirable and with all these cars you actually feel the road. Went to the Opera recently and the wow's my MGM got were not been given to the CTS' and the Mercedes. In my opinion there is nothing wrong with old as long as it works well and looks great.  What happened to distinctive US designs? Why do critics push for oriental clones?"
mercury,grand-marquis,2008,William Balla, 01/03/2009,Loyal Marquis fan,4,This is my third Grand Marquis and I have never been disappointed in any of them. Others can't come close to the   comfort and smooth ride that this car gives. A very dependable auto.
mercury,grand-marquis,2008,Grandma85, 05/12/2009,The only car I will BUY!,5,"This is my four grand marquis, I have loved abouloutley all of them. I had a 1993, 1998, 2005, and know a 2008. THis will be my last grand marquis, as I am 85 years old. I love these cars, one of the only cars on the market with a bench seat. I cannot drive cars with bucket seats and a floor shifter. Its way too cramped and uncomfortable. The comfort in this car, doesnt compare to any others. It has all the features i need, love the heated seats. This car also gets great gas mileage. On a long distance trip to ohio, i got 27.8 MPG. Which is amazing for a V-8 full size car. I am sad they are discontinueing these cars."
mercury,grand-marquis,2008,dale L., 07/07/2009,Classic comfort and quality,4,Have been wanting a large sedan for sometime after driving a smaller car for the mileage as a commuter. Now retired and 56 I decided it was time and after studying all reports and reviews I was convinced that this tried and true design was perfect for me. Also the fact that the car was a demo with very low miles made the price and deal UNBEATABLE!! Very comfortable and easy to drive and for a V-8 has reasonable mileage and is very quiet and smooth. Great value.
mercury,grand-marquis,2008,Dave, 04/27/2010,My fifth in 20 years,4,"I just bought my latest Grand Marquis after a death in the family and this is the nicest one yet. Decent mileage in a fun, reliable, comfortable car. My last four Mercury's never required mamor repairs and were as reliable as any car I can name. "
mercury,grand-marquis,2008,David, 08/12/2010,After a year of driving,4,"This car has performed quite well.   Performance: The car has a good amount of low end torque that will get this heavy car moving when you want it to. My only complaint here is the slight lack in higher RPM performance for when you pass during a high speed situation such as the freeway, it can take a bit to get it going a higher speed.  Reliability: I have yet to have a major problem with it.  I have done well in keeping it maintained and it has rewarded me with no major problems.  I have even driven it across the country.  The car is very comfortable with plenty of space for your passengers.  The fuel economy is standard for any full size sedan.  Just don't punch it everywhere."
mercury,grand-marquis,2008,George, 03/20/2008,Great V8 American Full-Size Sedan,4,"I have ridden in these Ford sedans for over for all my life. My grandparents have had two Town Cars and a Crown Vic. The Grand Marquis, on the same platform, is simply one of the most comofortable sedans out there. It's got room, V8 power, comfort and traditional style, which stands out on today's roads. I hope Ford keeps these sedans around and updates them. Their comfort is hard to beat and it's a throwback to an earlier era, in which I wasn't even born, of big, luxurious sedans. No matter your age, young or old, the Grand Marquis offers great value and should be test driven!"

What can I say, I like the car for all the same reasons aforementioned, but mostly for comfort and reliability. The only exception to this is that I have encountered a AC problem in three of the four I've owned. A 94, 98, 04, 08, and only the  94 was trouble free. But then again it is the only problem. If Merc. could get this right it's a Peach."
mercury,grand-marquis,2008,J & B , 03/27/2008,Best Ride Over and Over and Over,5,The best ride for a lot less money amoung full size vehicles.  This is our fourth Grand Marquis and we've gotten up to 30 MPG on trips consistantly.  Had only minor problems with any of them.  Is a very dependable vehicle  and the power pedals really help with our height differences.
mercury,grand-marquis,2008,PantherPilot, 12/14/2016,DIRT CHEAP ROOMY RWD V8 -- I LOVE IT SO FAR,4,"I love my LS.  This is the 3rd used MGM in our family so far. I got all of them used for stupid cheap.  This one had only 31.5k miles on it.  Inside is all leather and walnut burl.  When I bought it, the driver window was stuck down -- I had the armrest window switch replaced for $85 (parts & labor).  The tires it wore looked like the factory tires yet and were dried out, so I put on some new Michelin Defenders; not cheap tires but the ride immediately became smoother and quieter.  The driver's visor vanity mirror lid was cracked -- I replaced that with a used eBay visor for $50.  Other than normal wear items such as tires, a battery, etc, the car has been pretty much flawless.  It now has 51k miles and runs like a top.   Brake pads still have plenty of meat left on them.  Car tracks straight and handles great.  Decent pickup for a big car.  Not a race car by any means, but easy to merge or pass someone with on the Freeway.  Tons of seating room.  Tons of cargo space.  Nice for towing a light UHAUL trailer whenever you like.   Woodtone steering wheel feels wonderful, although I normally drive one-handed at 6 (and maybe also 9 o'clock) position and it's perfect for that.  Wonderful bright headlights that light up the shoulder when you hit your turn signal.  Integral fog lights.  SIX...yes, I said SIX seatbelts.  Mine burns regular but also accepts E85 flex fuel.  Surprisingly good mileage on freeway -- over 26 mpg driving from LA to Sacramento area and back.  In town, the mileage sucks, but remember, in LA you are idling a lot at red lights.  Things I would like to change:  Raise rear end a bit so hitch doesn't scrape.  Brake function....although I may have some air in my brake lines.  Driver seat is too benchlike; it is very comfortable, but I'd like more lateral support.  Previous owner did not order with side airbags; I would have ordered those...

UPDATE: Took over my wife’s car in late 2017 and sold this one.  Had no trouble finding buyers and it fetched a good price.  I miss my MGM.

Love the big cars but this model has taken a step back. The materials used on the interior are cheapened plastics with sharp edges of the molding process left untrimed. Cup holder is sub standard, rubber shift arm cover prematurely wearing. Poor gas mileage, round town and hwy, avg 17.3mpg. Engine noise horrible, like a desiel, Mercury says it's the fuel injectors and normal. Normal or not, it's not quality. Exterior paint was not complete in hard to reach areas like inside door edge.

Speaking of storms, it does horrible in adverse weather and to top it all off, we had a few quality concerns, though the drivetrain has ran flawlessly. Our previous Mercury, a '97 Sable, was the exact opposite experiance. The ride and handling were ballanced well and traction was never a problem. It also seemed to have more leg room which is why we sold the Grand Marquis and are purchasing a 2012 Taurus tomorrow. The quality of the leather alone in the Taurus is 10X that in the G"

My local dealer and factory rep says the car meets standards. I previously owned a 2002 and was very happy with it, but it was much quieter than my 2008.

mercury,grand-marquis,2008,Jim D, 04/22/2008,Disapointed,3,"We have a 2003 Crown Victoria that we have loved. We just bought a 2008 Grand Marquis with the new 17 inch wheels and I hate it. The car seems to have a mind of it's own when you are on the open highway. This is where the 2003 Crown Vic. is the most fun to drive but the 2008 Grand Marquis wants to drift all over the road. I think the problem may be that the front end is set up for the old 16 inch wheels and with the 17 inch wheels you are getting a wider bite of the road which causes it to want to drift. The high beams are also pretty useless. They do a great job of illuminating signs and trees but don't put much good adding light to the roadway. This may also be a 16"" vs 17"" setup issue."
mercury,grand-marquis,2008,Tom B. Bodine Sr, 03/01/2020,Lov e my Grande Marquis,5,"I currently own 2 Grande Marquis, a 1998 and a 2008 both of which I bought new. I have had no major problems with either.  The 98 has 132,000 miles and the 08 62,000 miles.  Both have been properly maintained. I had the front end rebuilt on the 98 and tires and batteries only. I do have  electrical problems with the door locks. The 98 had an AC problem that cost over $500 to repair. I use Michelin tires and the ride is great. When I bought the 08, I decided I was not going to let the dealer shaft me.  We negotiated the price.  I then told them I had a Ford employee discount (my wife's brother), I owned another Ford product and received the Ford loyalty discount and since the 2009s were out I received an end of the year discount.  I then surprised them by not having a trade in (they had already looked at my 98 and I did not tell them I was not going to trade it in.  I then really surprised them when I said I would write a check for it. I received a chunk off the MSRP. and felt like I won. While they were assembling the paper work I was reading brochures on the coffee table and kind of liked the paint sealing system. They said it would cost $400. But what was attractive was they said I could bring it back each year on the anniversary and they would redo it for $99. I bought it.  At the end of the year I brought it back and when I picked it up the total was $299. I loudly complained and the said the had to ""detail"" the car first.  I said detail hell! it sits in the garage most of the time (we drive the 98) and has 4400 miles on it.  They said it was company policy. They got me in the end and I will never patronize them again.  As a side note I am a member of the local Sheriff Merit Board and to the man, the deputies, who are driving the newer police cars, said they wished they had their Crown Vics back even with the high mileage. I am 84 years old and I intend to keep both GMs and I do not intend to purchase bany more vehicles"
mercury,grand-marquis,2009,hpr2, 08/02/2011,Terrific Value In A Traditional Car,4,"I've owned 12 Crown Victoria and Grand Marquis sedans since 1989. I came across a 2009 Grand Marquis LS Ultimate Collection with just 8.400 miles on June 1, 2011.

This car is not only the best full size Ford product I've ever owned, but the BEST car I've ever owned !

Say all you want about being dated, but these cars were a salesman's dream....no failure along the side of the road. Ever.

The evolution from 2004 to 2009 was a continued improvement in ride and transmission driveability, shift points, etc.

I've just retired and feel set for many years to come. Remember the ""special feel of an Oldsmobile"" ? As long as I can, I will have the ""special feel of a full size Ford product""."

mercury,grand-marquis,2009,DavidW9819, 07/12/2015,Great Car For Tall Drivers,5,"I'm 6'3"" and 300 lbs., and most cars made since 2000 are WAY too small to accommodate a man my size.  Not so with the 2009 Grand Marquis.  I have more headroom and legroom in this car than I'll ever need, although the back seat is a bit cramped.  That's not an issue for me, as I rarely have any passengers in the car with me, and if I did odds are they'd be a lot smaller than me and just fine with the rear seat accommodations.   I bought this car in 2011 for less than 1/2 the original MSRP and something like 27 K on the odometer because it was a fleet vehicle and the Grand Marquis was slated to go out of production that year.  In the four years I've owned this car, the only maintenance costs I've had are a new set of tires and regular oil changes.  I wouldn't even had to purchase new tires if the ones that were on the car when I purchased it hadn't dry-rotted.  (I live in the West, and the desert sun and heat rots rubber like you wouldn't believe.)  The steering column shaft was replaced under recall by the local Ford dealership in April 2015 even though my car is six years old, so kudos to Ford for having the integrity to stand behind its products even though they've discontinued the Mercury nameplate.  The only downside of the car are the low (around 11) MPG's, but that's probably because I do mostly city driving and run the A/C (terrific, by the way) 8-9 months of the year.  Fortunately, my round trip mileage to work is less than 10 miles, so even with gas currently at $3.15/gallon locally, the low MPG isn't really an issue for me.  I'm sure that the fuel economy would probably double if I drove on the interstate more often.  The 2009 Grand Marquis is one of two vehicles (the other being the Ford Ranger) that I wish Ford hadn't discontinued.  Both are reliable, low maintenance vehicles that will easily go 200,000 miles with proper care.  Hey Ford, how about making more vehicles without all the latest gadgets for us old guys?

Fate made me stop at by Mercury dealer when I was looking for replacement for car that broke down at 100k miles.  Salesman asked what I was looking for and I pointed to the Marquis as a joke.  He gave me keys and I said what the heck and drove it.  I then bought it.  I'm well over 6 feet tall and this is first car that I can stretch out my legs.  Ride is ridiculously comfortable and I float down the highway.  Yes, steering is squishy but this is not a sports car.  Talked to a mechanic who's been replacing engines over 20 years and he never worked on a Marquis.  So comfortable, reliable, cheap.  You must drive this car."
mercury,grand-marquis,2009,Marq3, 12/06/2017,What a nice car!,5,"Update: Just traded it in.  Required complete rear suspension at 104,000 miles.  That's after the transmission rebuild at 100,000 miles.  Not so great by any means; disappointing really, but also not why I traded it lol.  My daughter's car got totaled so I bought her a new Buick.  The deals on those were just too good to resist, so I bought a second one for my wife and traded the Merc in on that.  They gave me $4800 on trade for it.  The suspension and transmission work were about $3400, so that hurt a bit!
The Buicks are nice, but they don't ride as well as the Grand Marquis did, and I miss that ""wide body"" room inside.

Third Grand Marquis - had an '89, '93, and now this '09.  They were/are all great cars.  Decent performance and economy; wonderful room, comfort, amenities, and ride; I find them to be quite handsome-looking (ymmv); and basically bullet-proof.  The front seats could provide a little more contour (they're kinda' flat) and ""cush,"" but they are still quite good.  I actually prefer cloth seats, but these are leather and that's just fine.  Bought it Nov 21, 2017 with just under 79K miles for $6900.  It was originally from Nevada, then Missouri so NO RUST anywhere - my mechanic gave it an inspection and couldn't find anything wrong with it at all.  Nice.  I promptly added some Nokian WRG3 SUV tires for year-round traction here in Michigan and also hit Crutchfield to upgrade the sound system with better speakers, an amp, and a head unit with AUX input and bluetooth capability.  I have also had two Crown Victorias (and was really looking for an LX Sport or PPH Package when I found this) and can't really find anything to complain about with the Panther cars.
** UPDATE**
Got an email from Edmunds requesting an update, so here it is:
Still running and driving great overall.  Has a persistent ""squeak"" over bumps, but it's not that noticeable.  Required a rebuilt ETAC/HVAC head, and currently will miss a little when it's wet and cold ... probably needs a coil pack (I hope that's it).  I probably won't worry about that until next winter.  When I got the car with under 80K miles on it, the service history showed several brake jobs which I thought was a little odd.  Now the brakes shake/shudder a bit and I'm getting them done again here pretty quick and it only has about 10K miles on it since I bought it ... for some reason, this car chews up a set of front brakes about every 20K miles on average.  
Overall, it's doing an awesome job of getting me around and I get a LOT of compliments on it.
**UPDATE**
Got another request for an update.  Still running great at 100,000 miles.  However, the power driver seat has begun to work only intermittently which is a problem since my wife is, like, five feet tall.  Also, the transmission went out and it is in the shop getting that rebuilt as I type this.  I haven't gotten an estimate on repairing the seat (it'll need to go to the dealer since my local shop can't fix the problem), but the transmission re-build will be about $2400.  
I have had five Panthers over the years, and this is the second one to need a new transmission before 120,000 miles.
KBB value on it has only dropped $500 in the time I've owned it - I've put 20,000 miles on it in that time, so it seems to be holding its value very well.

These are great cars.  I own one.  When it dies (maybe 250000 miles) I'll get another one. The only thing that comes close is a full size suv and they get lousy gas mileage.  Edmunds needs to realize that there are  a lot of us that love these cars and we actually shave.  This generation of testers/reviewers that thinks a car is supposed to do everything except bury you, needs to get jobs doings something else. Detroit doesn't have a clue what people really want. Sort of like the government.  Update, October 2016.  Car is fantastic.  Other than oil changes, and fuel, no expense whatsoever.  Odometer is now 185000. As of April, 2017, the odometer is 192000. No problems. Nada. Nothing. Go buy one. October 2018.  Had to replace the intake manifold. Made out of plastic.  About $1000. Still, 12 years, and now 225000 miles.  I keep waiting for it to die. It will probably outlive me.

mercury,grand-marquis,2011,ejfudd, 10/29/2011,Reverse Cool (aka: Happy Motoring),4,"That some bemoan the Grand Mercury for being a poor handling automobile is unfortunate.
The Grand Marquis was never meant to handle like a car half its weight, but rather this American chariot was meant to isolate its occupants from the bumps in the road and all the outside noises.
When I think of the Grand Marquis, the engineering adages ""Keep it simple"" or ""Simple is best"" come to mind.
Admittedly, there's not much current styling going on here, to the point that my teenage son calls it ""reverse cool"".
Still the Grand Marquis achieves the classic Americana pitch & roll feel that will slowly fade as these classics dwindle on the roads.
As for me, I just bought a used Grand Marquis '11."

Add isolated chamber quiet, wide, safe and easy to find a nice used one and this car could be the sleeper used car find for the wise! 

Buy 2003 or newer, run only 5-20 synthetic, replace the LCM lighting control module (see ebay-weak relay) and you have a cheap, reliable upscale ride for $5k+/- that should hold it's value and get you 21 mpg avg for most and late 20s at 70! Easy to find a low miler that been driven by an adult too

 The Panther platform extends form the Ford Crown Victoria which has been the work horse of every police department from here to Kalamazoo.
The Mercury Grand Marquis is just a more dressed up version. The front engine rear wheel drive provides a stable and luxurious ride.
The Mercury is an intermediate between the crown vic and the ultra luxurious Town Car. It has great durability and more room than any import unibody garbage out there."
mercury,grand-marquis,2011,rickydee2, 10/20/2013,Mercury Grand Marquis Review,5,"Edmunds review of the mercury Grand Marquis tells me they have never driven one or other Ford products like them. Such as the Ford Crown Victoria or the Lincoln Town Car

The mileage estimates for all there are not accurate. I have owned all three of these cars and they all get at least 29 to 30 miles to the gallon on the highway and 19 to 20 in town. I owned a 1997 Ford Crown Victoria with a police interceptor engine, but had the highway geared rear end. It was personally owned by a police officer as his own car. I drove that car from Kansas City to Memphis and filled up when the fuel gauge was almost on empty. It took about 17 gallons to fill it up and I had drive 497 miles!"

It is huge inside (able to take a sixth passenger!), smooth and comfy and I liked it for this.
However much I liked it, I have to admit that it is very thirsty on fuel and is enormous on the outside - not easy to park in a multi-storey cark park.
It also corners in a heavy and sloppy fashion, as you would expect looking at it.
It is an old design with all of the good and bad points you would expect of this."

mercury,marauder,2003,Neil B., 11/09/2009,One too many repairs,3,"Cool car, but it's been more than 20 years since I've owned a car that so many things have broken or failed. Most are odd and surprising: lower A arms at 70,000 miles, rear axle seal at 80,000, failure of headlights (needed new Light Control Module at $400 just for the part), rusted lower steering column at 104,000. Also, a number of the interior lights (headlight switch indicator, power window buttons, heated seat buttons) no longer work.  Vacuum leak in the vent system disables controls. Now it is in shop, likely needing an $800 fuel pump replacement. I love the car but I've spent $3 or 4 thousand over the last 3 years fixing things that I've never fixed before in any other car I've owned."
mercury,marauder,2003,cred, 04/03/2010,Under the Radar,4,"The subdued styling, borrowed from the Grand Marquis and Crown Victoria allows the Marauder to be a true sleeper. Considering the weight of the Marauder performance is excellent. Handling is predictable, and can be pushed. Tail slide in hard cornering is likely in hard cornering or slick conditions, but the long wheel base and responsive steering allows a driver to push through it. On the entertaining side, when cruising on or slightly above the legally posted speed limit on the interstate, lines of brake lights will pop up and hearts will skip a beat as police cruiser clone pops out of traffic. Very reliable. I replaced a set of shocks, 18 oil changes, k&n air filter & drove it over 95k."
mercury,marauder,2003,eng1neer, 06/22/2002,Handles well at speed,3,"I have about 200 Miles on my Maurader.   I have had it up to 110 and it 
handles pretty well at that speed.  I have been babying it a bit since its so 
new.  Car pulls pretty well at upper RPMs and has smooth continuing power 
but will not burn the tires off the line very well.  Ford Tech services claims 
fuel cut off at 123 but have yet to test this.  Seems to handle much better at 
speed than the Crown Vic Sport pkg Car.  Overall the car does very well but 
won't pass a gas station and it claims that Premium fuel is required.  Milage 
statement on sticker seems to be very pie in the sky optimum operating 
condition numbers."
mercury,marauder,2003,jdgrules, 02/03/2013,My Favorite Car,4,"I had always wanted a Marauder after seeing it in 2002 as a concept. Finally over a year I had a chance to pick one up with 11k on it! Its been the best car i've ever owned, never breaks down and ive done oil changes, tires (which are expensive), and add an k/n intake/exhaust and yes it's a little slow outta the gate but she scoots once in motion its like a freight train, and that 4.6 DOHC has the opportunity
to be so much more. I can recommend this car to ANYONE, if your even remotely handy with cars this car is a breeze to work on. 
Thing to keep in mind, the book values on the car are wrong, parts are a little tough and expensive, gas mileage isn't bad, insurance is cheap, and its fun!"
mercury,marauder,2003,cmarek, 03/24/2010,Overall great car to play with,4,"This beastly ride is great! It may not have the initial tire-chirping torque that marks a true muscle car, however it does get up to speed quite quickly and keeps up better with traffic than its crown vic, police interceptor, or grand marquis brethren.   Not to mention the leather seats are comfortable and make you feel very relaxed, and the car rides smooth down the highway thanks to the self-leveling air suspension in the back.  This car is a real head turner also, even bone stock 'cause it's one you don't see everyday unless you personally own one like me :D.  This ride is a great keeper for anyone who is lucky enough to have one."
mercury,marauder,2003,Trash, 12/29/2007,Wow,4,"I just bought my dream car. I paid too much, I don't care! The question above, that said "" Fun to Drive"" says it all. You step on the gas, and it pushes you in to the plush leather seats at 60+, and then you look and it says 100. Wow! The sound of the engine is a low ""gurgle"" unexpected from such a small V-8. Having driven it less than 1000 miles, I can only say that it handles well, but on a wet road surface  it could definitely get away from you. The quiet interior is only interrupted by the mellow exhaust tones as you depress the accelerator. A pleasure to drive, I'm thankful that I'm lucky enough to own one of these modern day muscle cars. This is the direction NASCAR should have gone. "
mercury,marauder,2003,sbcdrone, 08/23/2003,Just Missed,4,"The Marauder is almost complete, but has
a few flaws.  The exhaust system should
have been made from the same high-grade
stainless steel used on the Buick Grand
National.  The engine power comes in at
high rpm suggesting the Boss 5.4 from
the 2002 F-150 would have been a better
choice.  Opening the trunk in the rain,
or just after, is guaranteed to get
water in the trunk.  The sound system is
choked by small speakers, and the rear
window antenna is a poor choice.  A
trunk-mounted power antenna would
provide better reception.  Fuel
milage has been excellent; handling and
comfort are what I expected."

the Grand of Marquis's. Turns heads,

and lots of it. Rides a little rougher 
than other Grand Marquis's, but to be 
expected with the low slung tires. 
Could be more aggressive under 3000 
RPM, but makes up for it over that. 
Wish it held it's value a little

One owner,no accidents,housed in garage unless out of town. Very clean,excellent care. I take it to a touch less car wash then bring it home rewash and wax it. It is a 2003.

Regretted buying but found I never will sell it. Even my wife loves to drive it! Gas mileage is not good, but in third year of ownership, all I worry about is regular maintenance - no problems. I stupidly installed new snow tires on 17"" rims -- my Marauder is running at higher RPMs to run the smaller tirees and the traction control must be turned to off after 40 MPG with the smaller 17"" tires, but with snows, I go EVERYWHERE in our Minnesota winter -- I love the my Marauder's power, flexibility, and snow travel ability!"

that I was not putting it all the way 
to the floor only about 3/4 the way!!!
Not as strong from a start as my Allen 
Supercharged 96' Thunderbird but I 
could not comfortably seat five adults

a continuing improvement in take off

shifting. The car responds much quicker 
and with less gas pedal the more I 
drive it. I love the way it sounds and 
the handling is excellent for it's 
size. I have not floored it yet and I 
don't believe I will until about 1000

2003 until someone came out with this 
idea of the chevy version of the

compete with the Impala ss in the mid 
90's. Look at the design of the engine 
compartment, they could never fix 
anything larger than a 4.6 in the 
engine compartment. Ford needs to 
design the whole car. They need to 
build a real hot rod. 350 motor in the

mercury,marauder,2003,WENDELL FENNELL, 11/24/2002,I AM NOT MAD ABOUT ANYTHING,4,"I also own a 1996 SS Impala.  My SS is 
a super car, but not equal to the 
Marauder, in terms of power, quality, 
comfort, gadgets, etc.  However, I do 
prefer the lower profile of the SS. 

I fully intend to keep both cars 
indefinitely, but if I had to choose 
which to keep, it would be the Marauder."
mercury,marauder,2003,luvmymarauder, 12/08/2002,Roomy and Powerful,4,"The Marauder is truly a one-of-a-kind 
car on the market right now. It has 
great room, a nice sounding stereo, 
great performance and handling and a 
very nice interior. It has a great 
exhaust sound and throws you back in 
the seat when you step on it to get 
around that slow car on a two lane 
highway."
mercury,marauder,2003,2003MM, 12/14/2002,Muscle at its Best !,5,"A great car that seats 5 and has the

test drive one for about an hour 
yesterday.  VERY fun car to drive.  
Looks like a sedan a businessman would 
own, but handles and performs like a 
much smaller, faster car.  Very tight 
handling due to the 50/50 weight 
distribution.

One thing I heard is driving this car 
will attract attention from Officer 
Friendly - and it makes sense given how 
powerful this car is."

just a whole lot of fun. (almost as fun

too (although i wish it had deeper 
exhaust)"
mercury,marauder,2003,Paul Kethman, 02/17/2003,A better idea!,4,"Just turned over 10K mi. Low end power 
much improved after first 2K to 3K mi.  
Rear wheels break away nicely from 
standing start now - still not a big 
smoke show - but 0 to 60 time in line 
with factory claim. Handling at speed 
is unbelievable!  Clover leaf 
corkscrews at 60+ mph (if you don't 
mind sitting on the door panel)!  
Highest speed to date is 115 mph - 
still has a lot of pedal to go to the 
floor and handles like it's on rails!
Interesting to hear about the fuel cut-
off at 123 mph - that will have to go!
Nothing wrong with stereo sound or 
controls unless you're already deaf and 
you're thumb is broken rendering the 
stearing wheel remote usless."

Everywhere I go, I get complimentary
comments about my Marauder.  Once the rpm's
exceed about 3000, this motor literally
screams.  I traded a supercharged 3.8
Pontiac SSEI for this vehicle and find
it superior in all categories...about
the same on mileage, but I didn't buy it

Volvos are BORING even in Sweden. So 
I´ve driven many car brands such as 
Audi, BMW and SAAB. In USA i bought the 
most american car of them all, beacause:
POWER! 300hp V8 is more than enough.
COMFORT! A Benz S-Class might beat it.
LOOKS! fast even parked. 
SOUND. Hey It´s a V8. I like V8´s. I 
love V8´s. 
HANDLING. When the road is straight 
it´s perfect. But you can´t cut street 
corners like a BMW 325.

most loved and rememberd. "

I was looking for a car with like performance, comfort and convieniences.  I bought the only silver Marauder they had on their lot.  This car has delivered in every way that I could have imagined.  It handles beautifully, absorbs the bumps well and has enough performance to get it down the road smartly.  I have 37,000 miles on it now, and other than oil changes, two trans fluid changes and a fuel filter, there have been no mechanical or other problems with the car.  It averages 21 mpg in every day driving.  It averaged 24 mpg on the trip we took to Florida last year."
mercury,marauder,2003,deerejoe, 04/14/2005,A true American muscle car...,5,"A whimsical purchase turned into a genuine love for driving and enjoying this great automobile. Ford Motor Company should have promoted the Marauder in a more vigorous manner to reach a greater consumer base.  This is NOT your average Mercury Marquis. Engine and suspension features are uniquely Marauder as are the interior appointments and exterior design motifs.  The vehicle stands alone in the luxury category for a large family sedan that can drive and run with the best on the road today.  The Marauder has the style, the performance and the 'glitz' to turn heads and generate real interest from all who see and wonder just what this car is all about.  Real CLASS at a reasonable price."

rocks! From 50 to 90 it nails you to 
the seat. It handles very well for a 
large sedan. The interior is very 
comfortable, heated seats are great. 
Love the tire & wheel combo. If you

love it. I have always driven older 
60's and 70's sedans, which I still 
own. But I had been following the story 
of the Marauder for the last 3 years 
and was very interested in it. When the 
car came out, I had read the reviews 
and they were very complimentary on the 
vehicle. Then in May, 2003, I had a 
chance to purchase the only one this 
dealer had. This car drives like a car 
should drive, plenty of pickup, 
wonderful appearance and roomy inside 
and the trunk. The car is very easy to 
drive and can be pushed if needed. I 
find that I can keep this car looking 
like new. It is very easy to clean."

mercury,marauder,2003,PMS, 02/22/2004,Almighty Powerful Marauder!,4,"The Marauder is NOT your average family 
car. It's HOT! From the initial engine 
throaty rumble eminating from the dual 
chrome exahaust pipes - you know it! I 
drive locally and on the Turnpike and 
have nothing but good things to say.  
Cornering is a breeze - no body roll - 
I can take most corners at 40 mph which 
is accompanied by the adrenaline-rush 
one gets on a roller coaster. Breaking 
is smooth and solid. Steering is very 
responsive -- the Marauder has 
serpentined many a pot hole here in PA 
this winter! This is truely a bad 
ass 'wolf' in sportly styled 'sheeps' 
clothing. I bought this as an early 
40th bday present and love to drive it 
whenever I can."
mercury,marauder,2003,JRW, 03/06/2003,Great car!,4,"Although this is a large vehicle, it 
handles nimbly. Acceleration and 
passing are spritely. The transmission 
shifts crisply. The engine is powerful, 
yet very smooth. The engine develops 
substantial torque at low engine 
speeds - making acceleration seem 
effortless. The Alpine sound system is 
very good. I really like this car!"
mercury,marauder,2003,Steven J, 04/26/2006,There but not quiet there stock.,4,"*Note, I am the second owner of this car.  I bought the car with 32,000 miles on it. Original owner had to have some warranty work done it. The radiator had gone out as did a window door switch.  So far, the only problem I had with the car was a dying car battery. In stock form, the car is slow to get up to speed and I don't care much for the stock 3.55s.  Ford could of done much more with this car. I've done a SCT xcal tune, coutersy of alternative automotive, to the car and switched the rear gears out to 4.10s and it is much faster. Makes a great daily driver. Very reliable, gas mileage is modest if you can avoid stepping on the gas all the time."

Best Advice, get a power tune or a chip, Your transmission will shift smoother and your engine will awaken from its factory EPA settings. Big Black and Fast!

comparing it to something that is front-

mercury,marauder,2003,Robert Hemlak, 08/08/2007,A real peformer,5,"I researched this auto for eight months before purchasing. I agreed with the negative comments about slow acceleration from a complete stop,I also agreed with the poor performence of the ""audio"" system. I corrected the slow acceleration problem by enlarging the air intake and the exhaust from manifold to tail pipe tips. The standard 3.55 gear ratio was lowered considerably. I addresed the audio problems by replacing the monoral amp.with more power and upsized the factory woofer with a quality larger one."
mercury,marauder,2003,GH, 08/19/2007,2003 Mercury Marauder,4,"Bought mine new in October 2002. Just broke 39000 miles in August 2007. No real issues. Electrical system can't keep up with electrical load at idle. Reason is Marauder alternator has built in slip clutch, allows more HP at idle and top end.  Pop it in neutral and step on emergency brake. Quiet and tight car. Go to Ford and purchase Police Interceptor badge for $10.00, slap it on and see the cars slow down.  Car has been looked at by CHP, FHP, local PD, none has ever said take badge off.  They ask wat kind of car it is; I show badge, say a Police Interceptor, open hood show engine, they say Oh yeah. Wish it came with Mustang 390 HP engine."

mercury,marauder,2003,jeffn, 05/28/2003,Love my Marauder,4,"Handles well, no slop in the steering 
and no ""floating"" in curves or on bumpy

quickly picks up once the tach reaches 
3000.  It has the quiet ride that you'd 
expect from Ford and the leather seats 
are quite luxurious."

No more conventional stearing has rack and pinion. Forged control arms with a better front and rear suspension and larger sway bars. Heavy duty transmision and coolers for it. Mustang rear end gears and so much more."

Once its off the line this car is an animal from 20-120.  I think Mercury hit it right. More horses would've made this car a gas guzzler. I think that they bailed out way too soon on HiPo.. now Chrysler has all the 4 door muscle. Including a suicide door Imperial.(Way to fo LM asleep at the wheel as ususal.)

But, having the Marauder for over a year now, I can tell you this car is really the best car for a big guy [6'4"", 275 lbs]with a family.  When you need to get the family to church on Sunday, it has ample room for five adults.  During the week, when you are driving alone for work or pleasure, it has the same high performance the SS had.  It has very nice handling to go along with the power, and the brakes are nice and tight for quick stops.  I give this car an ""A"" and plan to hold on to it for a very long time. Total reliability!!!"
mercury,marauder,2004,Art, 04/11/2007,Great Car,3,Fun to drive. Excellent performance. Love the exhaust sound. Gets lots of compliments from variety of ages. Great backroad driver as well as long trips. Probably the best car I have ever owned as far as a pleasure to drive and sheer fun.
mercury,marauder,2004,gharb62, 02/16/2004,marauder 03,5,"I traded a 2000 Lincoln continental for 
a 2003 Marauder and have not been 
sorry.  I have been followed into 
parking lots by people asking me what 
kind of car it is.  I am over 60 and 
have corvettes and jaguars and this is 
the best.  I took it the track and went 
against the kids in their rods and did 
the quarter in 14 and 95mph and I'not 
an expert, and had my wife in the car!"

late 60's and early 70's.  Fun to drive. "
mercury,marauder,2004,seadog215, 10/20/2004,Great Car,4,"My cousin talked me into buying it. I 
have a Lincoln Blackwood and was 
looking for another car. and this car 
is a Gas. Fun to drive Corners like a 
big Saab but has that american feel for 
the road. Good gas mileage when 
cruising 60-70 great pickup from 40 on 
up. its so good I had to get a new 
radar detector. Huge trunk.comfortable 
seating. Decent sound system but 
nothing to brag about. But I think they 
only made 18000 of them each year for 
two years. So if you want afun car to 
drive that may go up in value this is it"
mercury,marauder,2004,Jerry, 02/02/2009,Dream To Own And Drive,5,"This car is a dream if you are interested in performance. It has the power to merge into traffic on the freeway and the power to pass other vehicles on 2 lane roads. I am getting about 23 MPG on the highway and about 20 MPG in the city. It is so comfortable that I can drive this car for 350 miles without stopping and not get tired. There is plenty of room in the back seat for your passengers and there is a center fold down armrest in the back seat. The visibility from to the outside from inside the ""cockpit"" is excellent and all the gauges are easy to see. The console makes a handy storage area but unfortunately neither it nor the glove compartment lock.  I love this car."
mercury,marauder,2004,dpjtax, 12/05/2004,I love this car,4,"I bought this car right before Thanksgiving last year. Aside from the fact that it drinks gas like there's no tomorrow, I love it. Big, powerful, and it looks like an unmarked police car! People get out of my way on the interstate! I have had unbelievable good luck with Mercurys, and this one is no exception. I think this car has been discontinued, which is a shame. It is one car that does it all."
mercury,marauder,2004,Jammin Joe, 01/22/2004,GetOneNow,5,"Too bad Ford never ADVERTISED this car!
The only way I discovered that it
existed was seeing it on the cover of an
auto rag.  

This is an EXCELLENT car, worthy of much
more acclaim than it will ever receive,
as I believe it's been slated for
discontinuance (Most likely because no
one told the marketing department about
it!)."

mercury,marauder,2004,ryannelson111, 04/01/2004,Great Car,4,"Great fun to drive car.  I traded in 
my 1997 Crown Vic with 210,000 miles 
on a 04 Marauder and couldnt be 
happier, plus Merc is offering 0% 
interest for 5 years.  Great exhaust 
note but not too loud.  The car is 
basically a new Crown Vic Sport with 
better engine, no woodgrain, much 
better suspension, and bling bling 
wheels. Most people have never heard 
of a Marauder which is a plus in my 
book.  Plus it tows my 3000 lb trailer 
with no problem.  Should be easy to 
repair and maintain since it is 
basically a Crown Vic.  Only one brand 
and model of tires available to fit 
rear (which might be an expensive 
proposistion several years from now)."
mercury,marauder,2004,FinishLine, 04/25/2004,ImpMauler,4,"First thing first. This car can stamp 
out any Impala on the road.  However, 
the Imp was built almost ten years ago 
and still is a worthy adversary.  To me 
that doesn't make sense.  This car 
should have been 360 horsepower more 
low end torque and equipped with a five 
speed automatic/auto stick. Then I 
would be able to understand Ford's 
ingenious advertising scheme for this 
car (not!)Which we all know was no 
advertisement at all. Because you 
wouldn't have to advertise a car like 
that.  But that didn't happen did it?   
And that is why this is the last year 
the beloved Marauder will be built.  
What a shame!!"

smooth and nice rumple, wish it was 5

glad i bought this car. There are some 
things one might complain about,

car is the cool factor. Although every 
car could have more horses, this car is 
overflowing with testosterone. I like 
the fact that it is rare, but wish 
people would stop saying it looks like 
a cop car. I didnt buy it for that

mercury,marauder,2004,James Spradling, 10/09/2004,Mercury Marauder,5,"Mercury should've continued this rear 
wheel drive musclecar and added a 
supercharger to it. Mercury's failure

automobile. It has it all:  
Performance, Handling, Looks an all 
around great pleasure to drive.
Ford/Mercury failed miserably to 
advertise this vehicle and get it out 
to the public. Examples: GTO, HEMI, 
these words and advertising are really 
selling cars. If Mercury had followed 
suit and made it to the Two Door model 
and bumped-up horse power versions, 
this car would be a Buyer ""Magnet.""
I truly feel sorry for those that 
didn't experience driving the 
machine... "

mercury,marauder,2004,grazniM, 07/25/2007,Bring back the Marauder,5,"Incredible Machine.  Bought mine used and it totally rocks; owned many large and small cars. This one is a blast to drive, turns heads, is super comfortable, easy to maintain, and for its size (both overall and engine), it gets great mileage - 26.5 on my last trip to DC.  Merc really dropped the ball on the marketing of this vehicle."
mercury,marauder,2004,DRB, 03/27/2008,Comfort and Power,4,Since August 2004 when I bought it never had a problem with it still sounds and acts the same as the day I drove it of the lot.  Everyone from cops to passers by have to check it out. Like the days of old it is a full size car that has power galor that will give the thrills of yesteryear when everyone loved US muscle cars.  On a trip the car is great on the highway about 400 miles to a tank on a trip. Just keep your foot out of it in the city. Best fuel performance in the 2200 to 2400 RPM range normal driving.  Faster than a stock Mustang GT in a quarter mile race.
mercury,marauder,2004,D Vegas, 01/08/2009,Last American Car,4,"Bought my 2nd one in 2004. Racked up 70,000 miles on the first one with no major issues. Paint does scratch easily on both years. Does not handle like a large platform, long wheel base provides the ride. Dual tuned exhaust provides the sound. Dual overhead cam power plant provides the mid range power.It is a bit slow of the line for a 300+ HP. Fortunately a number of houses provide some power enhancements for the vehicle for kid in us. I am somewhat a younger Marauder owner and would have preferred a better sound package and IP. Cup holders are not very good, like you get a chance to use them when hot rodding. Will bring you in to the dark side. High tire expense. Gas mileage is excellent"
mercury,marauder,2004,Csmejkal, 01/26/2004,Marauding in the Marauder,5,"The handling is great. Taking corners 
with some speed feels like you are one 
with the road.  She makes you want to 
push her and see how she handles.  The 
acceleration is just, well, take her 
for a ride and find out!"
mercury,marauder,2004,evansc6, 02/08/2005,A fun four-door sports car,4,"I'm fairly happy with my '04 Marauder. Its plenty fast (though I'd love to add a supercharger), comfortable, and the fuel economy is pretty good at 20 mpg around town. I would recommend an '04 over the '03s because the newer ones have a better transmission (mine doesn't thunk into the next gear like the '03s). A little too much cheapy plastic inside, and the build quality isn't up to par with BMW, Mercedes, or even Honda. But overall a fun car to be had in the low $20Ks right now."
mercury,marauder,2004,novars71, 04/08/2004,03 Muscle not there!,2,"The hype that this mercury is in the 
lines of any muscle car just isn't 
true.  The 302hp engine does not do it, 
poor acceleration, good for high speed 
driving but 0-60 not impessive. That's 
what the ""muscle cars"" were all about. 
I still have a 1971 chevy nova small 
block that will leabve this mercury in 
the dust.  Its basically a souped up 
Grand Marquis with a high $35000 price 
tag and I regret buying it."
mercury,marauder,2004,Dominique, 06/22/2004,"A $32,000+ Car?",1,"I'm astonishing that Mercury can price 
a car over $32,000.  302 horses sound 
great.  But no appearance at all.  
Seems to be a taxi-looking car.  Both 
exterior & interior are definately eye-
sored.  Even Ford T-Bird looks better.  
With $32,000+ budget, smart people can 
look for Acura TL (270hp), Nissan 350Z 
(287hp), Subaru Impreza WRX STI 
(300hp), Infiniti G35 (260-280hp).   Or 
with few additional grands, people can 
buy BMW 330i (225hp) or Volkswagen 
Passat W8 (270hp). 0-60 for those cars 
are around 6.0 sec.  WRX STI is even 
less than 5.0 sec.  Just think about 
it..!!"
mercury,marauder,2004,Love this car!, 01/16/2010,This is a Great car!,4,"Overall, I love this car, however there are a couple of things I think Ford missed.  Obviously, they could've put the supercharger on the thing.  I also think that it would be nice to have a suspension adjustment switch.  It rides very nicely most of the time, but when you're on a bumpy road, you feel it!  It would be nice to be able to soften up the suspension a bit when you're just not in a performance type of a mood."
mercury,marauder,2004,Greg E, 02/09/2010,Best Car,5,"I've owned alot of cars over the years, and this is one of the best. I wish they were still made. You can't beat the combination of performance and comfort. "

not bad for a 4300lb car.  Not only is 
it fast but with its beefed up 
suspention it handles as good as my 
mustang.  Its one of the nicest looking 
exteriors in a long time, and its the 
first attractive interior ive seen 
sence the 60s.  Its great fun to drive

one and liked the handling and power. 
The seats were very comfortable and it 
was a lot of fun to drive.  The fact 
that the only color was black inside 
and out discouraged me from buying. In 
July 2003 I saw a silver Marauder with 
light gray (flint) interior and I 
changed my mind on the spot. The engine 
is quick to respond and the steering 
control is very positive.  The front 
bucket seats are extremely 
comfortable.  The car corners very 
nicely and the BFGoodrich tires hold 
the road exceptionally well even in 
heavy rain. I have found owning it to 
be delightful experience."

there in real comfort. You need the 
cruse control or you find your self 
exceeding your estimated speed. Fit and 
finish is very good and they got the 
torque converter stall and transmission

since they are driving normal Grand M's 
or Crown Vic's. One word of advice, for 
those that live up North - buy a remote 
starter (or better yet, do as I did and 
negotiate it as part of the deal - I 
got it for ""free"").  BEWARE:  No snow 
tires are made for the back wheels. "

The car drives great and I average 25mpg city driving. The car has good pick up for a 4cyl SUV. It's very comfortable and is fun and easy to drive.

for work and while shopping around I cam
across the Mariner and fell in love with
the interior (black leather with beige
inserts) and just had to take it for a
test drive and lets just say it was real

at all. So I bought it that day and I am

many years ahead."

We couldn't be happier with our purchase! bought it with 47,000 miles on it, and it preforms like new. enormous amount of room for being a small SUV. handles better than our ford focus we replaced for this. We plan to buy another Mariner (2010) when its time to say goodbye to our 05'. This SUV has all the options I could ask for and more! leather, power window, locks, seats, mirrors, heated seats, mirrors, roof mount for garage door opener & glasses, very bright visor light (great for reading & night), auto adjust rear view mirror, auto headlights, etc. This is so far the best vehicle I have ever owned."
mercury,mariner,2005,Bill Reichert, 09/27/2018,Extremely Reliable Small SUV,5,"Bought this vehicle brand new in November 04 when it was first available and special ordered with every option except a sunroof. I have been very pleased with everything this vehicle has to offer. It had a very loud road noise at the beginning but that was because of the OEM Continental tires that it came with. I have since only had Michelin tires and that made it much quieter. It has a very good 4WD system and does very well in the snow. I now have 136,000 miles on this vehicle and the only problem it ever had was the passenger seat heater module quit working but was repaired under warranty.
Update: 3/31/2020  I still have this vehicle and everything is still doing well.  I have not had any issues and I am glad that I still own it. Mileage is 137,000.

mercury,mariner,2005,Kara, 08/16/2008,My experience with the Mariner,4,"I purchased this vehicle because I wanted an SUV with decent gas mileage. I really like my Mariner, but have had a few problems with it. When I bought it, at 28K miles it still had its warranty in effect. Good thing because even though I test drove it, I hadn't noticed that there was a probem with its overdrive. I had it repaired under warranty, but soon after more problems with the trans surfaced. I had to take it back 5 months later because it was hesitating & loosing power when driving up steep hills. The entire trans had to be replaced. It has been a few months & I am noticing a clunk going into 2nd when I let off the gas. I am worried it is going bad again, the warranty is now expired."
mercury,mariner,2005,GEORGE SCHOTT, 03/11/2005,My mariner,2,"The vehicle is very noisy there is a lot or transmission noise and vibration.The instrument cluster is a disaster (information center)95% of the time you can't see it due the reflection the charactors are difficult to read. The compass is useless it is stuck over in the extreme left corner using a little stick figure for information.Seating has almost no lateral support. There is no indication if the transmission is in 4wd or 2wd, is gives you a unsure feeling when you are wet or slipery conditions. So far i am not impressed with the gas mileage best i have done is 18.5 At normal speeds. The overall noise inside the car is excessive my last 2 trucks didn't make this much noise"
mercury,mariner,2005,Denise, 11/06/2010,Noisy,4,"Just purchased a week ago. So far, a lot of wind noise even @ 45mph, rattling noise on passenger rear side, and it vibrates like crazy @ stoplights. Engine sounds like it's idling too high like it's ready to race. Also the windshield wipers are extremely loud!! Thumps. I took 3 months deciding if I wanted this suv or not. Wish I would have waited longer."
mercury,mariner,2005,hov, 01/13/2006,Disappointed with the paint.,4,"I really enjoy driving the Mariner.  It is fun to drive and handles really well.  I was disappointed in the design after I found that the paint below the rear passenger doors (where the body flairs out) was badly chipped after only 2k miles of careful driving.  We put on mud flaps and it was re-painted, 2k later, the same result.  Ford claims this is a vehicle trait.  A very poor trait to have in an otherwise good vehicle.  I am curious to see if anyone else has noticed this premature wear."
mercury,mariner,2005,Bob, 04/25/2007,Very high build quality and good mileage,4,This Mariner is a very handy size vehicle that has provided better than expected fuel economy (24 mpg on the highway). The all wheel drive works very well in northern Vermont winters. The build quality of the Mariner is exceptional. In almost 2 years of ownership we have not yet had a problem. 
mercury,mariner,2005,Stephanie, 02/15/2005,Just got it,4,"I've only had it for a week (Luxury FWD Satelite Silver), but I love it. (I sold my 2001 CRV no power at all, but reliable). It is a bit fuel greedy, feels solid, sturdy, rides like a car, rides better than my Honda, acceleration is good. I noticed some vibration in the gas pedal below 60 miles per hr, but that seems to be disappearing the more I drive it. (I only have 650 miles on it)."

mercury,mariner,2005,Kortney, 05/20/2005,Love my Mariner!,4,"I love my Mariner.  I went from a Mustang to this ""more family"" type vehicle.  The power is impressive for this suv.  It is very comfortable for me.  I did remove the side steps because I found they really served no purpose, my dress would drag across and get dirty when getting in.  I removed them and problem fixed and it looks great still.  I love that the back glass will open by itself, I've used this feature very often already.  the gas mileage I average is 18.6 (better than my Mustang) so I'm happy."
mercury,mariner,2005,Ann, 01/13/2006,Great SUV,4,"Have had this SUV for a year now. Bought it for our expanding family. It's great. Rides smooth and much quieter than my previous Ford Ranger FX4. Lots of room for a stroller and groceries and lots of leg room in the back for the times I needed to be back there with the baby. Smooth handling and steering though a little soft in the rain. The seats are very comfortable but do not like the headrests. They do not tilt and cannot be removed so I have to sit with my head tilted forward, uncomfortable. Since they are for safety in a collision I am willing to live with it. Do not like the faux marble center console. Would have preferred solid black plastic or vinyl even. Would definitely by again."
mercury,mariner,2005,thomas, 01/16/2006,good value and reliability,4,"I am a used car dealer with access to all types of suvs and I like the way the escape and tribute look and perform. I choose the mariner because of the upscale style and it had more options available. I bought a fully loaded premier with every option and drove it out for 25k. It had a msrp of 29k so I felt the value was there.  The mileage has improved to about 21mpg average for the v-6. It feels very peppy and fun to drive. So far, nothing has broke or not performed as designed.  Nice stereo, great style, pretty leather, great seat heaters even though here in Texas, the ac is more important!  Now i am waiting to see if the resale value even gets close to my acura tl.  "

I own a sporty pontiac g6 but in my mariner, I feel overall SAFE, and it doesn't hurt that it is so sleek and stylish at the same time.

mercury,mariner,2005,Mercury Mariner, 12/21/2004,I hate this SUV,2,"I had read the Mercury Mariner was the 
top of the line SUV.
I bought the best one they had, 
thinking I got everything.  It cost 
about four thousand dollars more then 
the Escape, or the Jeep, and it has 
less features. A lot of things I 
thought were standard on the car, that 
most 1990 cars have on them, they don't 
even put on this car. They told me it 
was my fault, I should have asked if 
the car had them before I bought it. I 
had a 1995 Grand Prix, and it has more 
features on it then this one dose, and 
you can't even order them on the 
Mariner, because it isn't even an 
option.  They have not perfected this 
car enough.  I went to work the other 
morning, and the defogger on the back

mercury,mariner,2005,stephaniewesztergom, 05/11/2007,Mariner,2,"It is a noisy drive. Extremely poor fuel efficiency. Uncomfortable. The rear seats are supposed to fold flat to make a larger cargo area. Good luck with this feature. The seats do not fold. They lean forward making the ""feature"" obsolete! I am 22 months into my 39 month lease and I am trying to find a way to get out of this vehicle. I am very disappointed as my previous expereince with Mercury made me try the Mariner. Not again!"

mercury,mariner,2005,Kathleen, 03/09/2016,I loved this SUV!,3,"I owned this SUV for 9 years and it served me well. I currently lease a 2017 SUV and it doesn't compare to the features on the Mariner. The only thing I love on the new SUV is the Bluetooth feature. As the Mariner approached 10 years old, it started to need more maintenance which usually cost between $300-$1000 each time. Even though I only had 95,000 miles on it when it was sold, it needed about $1600 in repairs, which I could not justify. I was planning to sell it in October 2017, but sold it June 2017.

mercury,mariner,2005,Vanz73, 05/01/2008,Good but not good enough,3,"I bought this because my old expedition would not fit into my new company garage.  I wanted something small but still in the SUV range.  I was initially impressed with the features of the vehicle but in time I have found this vehicle lacking.  It uses way to much gas with weak acceleration.  The brake rotors are so cheap I spent more than $400 getting them replaced after only 19,000 miles (yes I drive hard - that's why I drive an SUV!).  I have had it in for warranty service to replace the gas tank intake and several switches (window, sunroof).  My brother has the same vehicle and he likes it.  For me, I am counting the days to trade it in."

After only two weeks, permanent stains showed up on the side panels from some liquid that had been thrown up by the tires.  The dealer claimed it was Armour All from the tires but agreed to repaint all of the panels because they shouldn't have stained so easily.  That process took over a week.  There is also a noise inside the door that sounds like a ball bearing rolling around--the source can't be found.  A $32,000 vehicle should not have this many initial problems!"

I have experienced some buzz/crackling with the speakers and the subwoofer is nothing close to the Infinity sub I have in my basement. However, the stereo sounds great when there is no distortion in the speakers.  I wish Ford would update their plain and boring entertainment clusters. The rest of the car looks great.  The suede insets on my seats are already a little marked up and I don't know how I should go about cleaning them -- if at all.  The knobs on the roof rack were murder on my thumbs.

mercury,mariner,2005,Bill, 07/30/2008,Mariner 2005 tires!,4,The only complaint I have and it ruins what oitherwise would be a good experience with a Ford product is the tire noise. The Continental Contirac tire's are noisy to the point of distraction and I curse them every time I drive it. Both Ford and Continental choose to egnore the problem of basically putting truck tires on this vehicle. Too bad they had a good thing going with the Mariner and let tires spoil this potential.

I love that this SUV has a sporty look, but at the same time it's elegant.  My Mariner is black with beige leather interior and it's so bueatiful.  I get so many compliments on it (still after 3 years).  It's big enough for 5 people to fit comfortably, yet driving it's so easy to get in and out of small spaces.

This was my first SUV, I wanted something with storage but not something huge.  I have a small roadster that I drive most of the summer, and every time I get back into the Mariner I'm reminded about how comfortable it is.  Easy to drive & park with a very comfortable interior for short and long trips.  My only problem was a radio with a defective speed sensor (which was replaced under warranty).  Recommended if you're looking for a small SUV."

Very comfortable ride and quiet, almost like a car.  We were hesitantly traded in our aging subaru outback, but now couldn't be happier.  Exterior styling is excellent.  We opted not to get the luxury enhancement package and comfort package (which would add power seat, driver message center, auto headlights), but we dont miss them.  The manual driver seat is plenty adjustable for me and my wife to both drive comfortably, and the car is still very functional without the other features."

At 55 and 75 mph the vehicle feels like the tires are unbalanced (they were checked by two dealer).  If parked on a steep downhill, the vehicle vibrated very strongly in park.     The pretty interior finishes and materials are not very durable.  In retrospect, I should have gone with the Chevy Equinox."
mercury,mariner,2005,Jeff, 07/24/2005,Good Little SUV,4,"I bought this vehicle to use as my company car.  I needed five passenger capability and enough cargo room to hold several demo cases.  I wanted somthing that looks a little classy to take clients out for lunch.  I also wanted better gas milage that most SUV can deliver.  I get a solid 21-22mpg with a mix of city and hwy driving.  I am 6'-4"" tall and found the car big enough to suit me.  The head room is excellent.  I leather seats are soft and supportive, I will probably put 25-30K miles on the car a year and comfort is importiant to me.  The small V6 performance seems a little weak to me because I am use to V8 powered vehicles like my F150 truck."
mercury,mariner,2005,Ron, 07/24/2005,100% Class,4,"It is difficult to believe sometimes that this is the same essential vehicle as the Ford Escape.  Mercury has done a VERY impressive job of tailoring the Escape platform to the tastes of those who want some style to go along with their versatility.  The interior is the best of any vehicle I have ever owned. The exterior is sharp, lots of understated elegance.  The ride is smooth and quiet, and the handling is reassuring.  It is fun to drive.  The only issues I have had with the car is that the heaters on the front seats frequently come on without being turned on, and that the offical EPA mileage estimates have so far proved unattainable.  But I still love it.  I truly love it."
mercury,mariner,2005,E. Keck, 07/25/2005,Initial impression exceeds expectations,4,"This is my first Ford (L-M) product in twelve years. I wanted an SUV for the hauling capability, yet didn't want the mileage penalty. The 4 cylinder is quite peppy, and provides decent mileage (23-24 MPG overall in the break-in period). I can't wait to see what it finally settle into. Styling is by far the nicest of all of the SUV's on the road.  Interior is well laid out, and has plenty of room for tall individuals.  The only criticism is that the seats are a bit narrow, but at least they are forgiving and provide decent comfort.  For a base convenience, this vehicle comes well equipped.  The base CD system is very nice.  I'd recommend a test drive, you will be pleasantly surprised."
mercury,mariner,2005,Steven Baily, 08/12/2005,Fun small SUV!,4,"This vehicle replaces a four door sedan we used to have, with kids on the way it was time for a small SUV. We looked at many others and felt the Mercury fit the bill with it's smooth styling and wealth of features. We liked the rainge of options including the AWD with the powerful V6. The acceleration is wonderfully smooth and totally unexpected from this SUV, everytime I drive this vehicle I am totally blown away! I only bought the car on Saturday and we've already put 1,000 miles on it!"
mercury,mariner,2005,CHUCK, 09/29/2005,Love it,5,"Since we purchased this vehicle for my wife the more she drives it the more she truly loves it. She says it is fun to drive and handles very well. She stated it drives as good as here 2000 jeep grand cherokee. For the dollars spent we feel it is/was an excellent value plus the cost for a new grand cherokee was approx.$8000 More, no complaints here at all, very, very satisfied so far."
mercury,mariner,2005,Andrea, 12/31/2005,I like my Mariner,4,"This car handles very well, has excellent acceleration, and is basically fun to drive. The base model includes all the essential features (auto.,A/C,CD,cruise,p/w,p/l,etc.), and the gas mileage is very good. Personally, I don't like giant gas- guzzling SUVs, so the economical and compact Mariner was a good choice for me. It gives you the utility, seat height, and road view of an SUV without being cumbersome and wasteful. Also, a lot of people have complimented the looks of the vehicle."
mercury,mariner,2005,Lisa, 01/04/2006,Rate this vehicle,4,"I love the style of the vehicle however the fuel economy is not what I expected. Currently the Mariner is only averaging 15.5 miles per gallon and on the sticker it stated 19-24 mile per gallon.  I currently have 7,000 miles on the vehicle.  Other than the mileage I am pleased."
mercury,mariner,2005,MARTIN SANCHEZ, 03/01/2006,If you have sophisticated taste...,4,"Ilove my Mariner... I saw it once coming out of a parking and I decided then from the outside look that was the SUV I wanted, just the right size not too small or too big. when I drove it, excedeed my expectations. This vehicle has the whole package; comfort, elegance and reliable. I was one of the first lucky ones driving around in my Mariner when they came out and boy Did I turned heads. Overall I am very pleased with it."
mercury,mariner,2005,William Raban, 06/01/2006,Mercury Mariner,4,"Excellent experience with vehicle.  Very reliable, and dealer is very responsive.  Would definitely buy again."
mercury,mariner,2005,RancidDelirium, 06/15/2006,Great Vehicle!,5,"I have a 5 year old who loves it, and the ride is smooth.  It's definetly a great pick for a first time SUV owner."
mercury,mariner,2005,caroline, 07/08/2006,Love My Mariner,4,"Well, I have  had my Mariner for a year now and simply, I love it! It is a great car that I feel safe in. It looks sharp and holds a lot for a smaller SUV. The only downside so far is that the gas milage is a little less than I expected and disappointing with the current cost of gas, but still I would never trade it!"
mercury,mariner,2005,Chugalug, 10/06/2004,...crazy 'bout my Mercury,5,"I just purchased our Mariner for my 
wife on 10/04/2004.  We chose the 
Mariner because of the refinement and 
class that it has.  This is more 
upscale than the Ford Escape and Mazda 
Tribute.  There are also far fewer 
Mariners out there for now.  The 
quality exceeds our expectations.  
Handleing and performance are 
exceptional as well.  The fit and 
finish are excellent too.  I am a tall 
big guy and I fit in the Mariner with 
ease and am very comfortable.  There is 
also plenty of back seat leg and head 
room.  Great lighting from headlights 
and fog/driving lights.  The ride is 
smooth and responsive.  "
mercury,mariner,2005,Tyrs, 10/17/2004,You've got to drive this car!!!!!,5,"I needed to replace my vehicle and 
stopped by my LM dealership.  I own a 
Ford Escape and WOW does this put that 
vehicle to shame.  The comfort, the 
ride, the handling.  Awesome.  I 
recommend everyone at least test drive 
this vehicle.  I was torn between the 
Mariner and the Mountaineer and I know 
I made the right choice."
mercury,mariner,2005,metheman, 10/29/2004,I LOVE THIS TRUCK,4,"I bought this truck after going to 
look at the Mountaineer due to all the 
commercials there have been lately.  
Very happy so far with the purchase.  
Outside of a smallish gas tank and 
hungry V6.  Beutiful looking truck, 
well put together.  this thing gets a 
lot of attention because there are not 
many out there.  GO BUY ONE if you are 
thinking of an mid size SUV I drove 
them all and this is the beat of 
everything all in one "
mercury,mariner,2005,skoutas, 10/31/2004,Just What I Was Waiting For.....,4,"I never thought I'd part w/ my Volvo 
until I saw the Mariner! I hate big 
cars-I refused to get a minivan, and 
resented every day I drove my husband's 
(very nice, but large)Jeep G.Cherokee, 
while he sported about in my S40. But 
there was no room in the Volvo for my 
double stroller and 2 car seats!In 
fact, I felt cramped in the Jeep 
despite its size.I always wished for a 
PRETTY SUV the size of my Volvo by a 
strong auto maker.Mercury listened! 
Hubby's a Ford man-I told him I liked 
it, & he was sold! My Mariner is almost 
2in shorter than the S40, with as much 
interior space as the Jeep! The cargo 
is plenty for my stroller and groceries 
I'm in love,& no more $8 Volvo 
replacement bulbs!"
mercury,mariner,2005,BRENDA SAVGE, 11/12/2004,third suv,4,"we went looking for another suv- had an 
explorer- traded in for expedition- which 
saved my life in a rollover on ice--
bought another expedition- and now we 
wher in of a second car/suv- in looking 
around at other models- we settled on 
the marnier on first site- bought the 
suv- without even test driving- and 
then drove it home 27 miles from the 
dealer-- and loved every minute of that 
drive- looking forward to taking the 
suv this weekend to las vegas- and 
given the expedition a rest..."
mercury,mariner,2005,The Monsignor, 11/13/2004,"Nice looks, tight ride.",4,"This vehicle nicely fills a niche 
between the larger luxury SUVs and the 
more expensive, smaller luxury SUVs (I 
consider it entry-level luxury).  The 
engine is wonderful and peppy (V6), and 
the two-tone leather trim is nicely 
done.  The suspension is smoother than 
the Escape, and it drives more carish 
than truckish.  Brakes are quite 
responsive.  The interior with chrome 
trim and very dark faux wood is quite 
handsome, and helped seal the deal.  I 
went with white (living in a hot 
climate and beige leather).  Mercury 
has done a nice job, and I expect to 
see more of these on the road soon.   "
mercury,mariner,2005,D. L. H., 11/24/2004,Drivin' In Style,5,"When my minivan was ready for 
retirement I knew I needed something 
that could work hard but look good.  I 
had been reading about the Mariner 
since forever and was eager to test 
drive it. Well one test drive was all 
it took!  
THE MARINER is IT!!  It has the 
roominess of a van, the handling of a 
car, the solid feel of safety, and 
enough of a trunk that we can pack up 
the family and head to the beach for a 
week.  Plus it's so pretty!  We 
definitely made the right choice!"
mercury,mariner,2005,FLASTV, 12/07/2004,What a surprise!!!,5,"I was looking for space, but not necessarily for an 
SUV. I had always liked the Ford Escape but was put 
off by the interior. I checked the Mazda6 wagon and 
really like it and the Chevy Equinox and hated it. 

It was kind of weird arriving to my local Lincoln 
Mercury dealership, it felt like they wouldn't have 
anything for me. Was a up for a surprise. 

The minute I test drove the Mariner I know I had to 
have one. Felt classy and American. You feel 
intelligent driving this little SUV, especially knowing 
the price. Feels good, looks good, sounds good.

After 1 week the good feeling hasn't faded. I miss 
things like the stereo controls on the steering 
wheel, but I love my Mariner a lot"
mercury,mariner,2005,dcsteg, 12/08/2004,I made the right choice,4,"I have been researching this vehicle 
for several months in the automoblle 
magazines.  It is everything I expected 
it to be.  Build quality is excellent.  
Black paint is perfect. Interior well  
thought out with good fit and quality. 
The ride is a lot more confortable than 
the Mark 8 I traded in, and gas milage 
is in the mid 18's. Dealership gave me 
a great deal and with the 1.9 
financeing it was a go."
mercury,mariner,2005,Slider, 12/16/2004,Affordable Luxury,5,"We test drove a bunch of vehicles 
including the Chevy Equinox, Isuzu 
Axiom, Honda CR-V, and the Mitsubishi 
Endeavor.  Being in our late 20s, my 
wife and I didnt ever think that we 
would be looking, let alone buying a 
Mercury, but we did.  We fell in love 
with everything from the two-tone 
leather to the waterfall grill.  My 
wife is 410 so the larger SUVs were 
out of the question.  The seat had 
more than enough adjustment to suite 
her needs.  The Mariner is far from a 
cloned Escape.  It is definitely in a 
league of its own.    "
mercury,mariner,2005,pcerres37, 12/31/2004,commentary on my mariner,4,"so far the only thing that I am not 
pleased with is the mileage it seems to 
use a lot more gas than I anticipated 
so I am disappointed"
mercury,mariner,2005,John W. Mapes, 01/06/2005,This was a good choice,4,"Real fun to drive although I feel its 
terrible on gas and the tank could be 
alot bigger than it is. Interior is 
very well planned but side seat 
controls are hard to access with doors 
closed. One problem I am experiencing 
is braking noise coming from both front 
and rear calipers, somewhat like it 
sounds when the brakes are worn and 
need replacing. Need to contact dealer 
on this. They are definatly dealing, 
with 1400 off sticker and 2750 in 
rebates I came in under 24000. All 
told, a great value I thought."
mercury,mariner,2005,Jay, 01/18/2005,Upscale Ford Escape...Very Upscale!!!,4,Ive driven a Ford Escape and traded it in for this beauty.  Excellent interior and exterior design althought I know its all Ford Escape within. I loved my Escape and didnt think it could get any better.  Boy was I wrong!!!
mercury,mariner,2005,Is it me or?, 01/21/2005,Not all happy,3,"Let me start on the positive.  The Mariner is pretty inside and out,as compared to the Escape and Tribute.  I have two major issues with this vehicle.  First, there is an undeniable steering wheel vibration at highway speeds (70+).  After 4 failed service appts., I demanded I drive another (no different).  The dealer blames it on Continental Tires, but after replacing all with Michelins, same problem.  They openly revealed that Ford/Mercury is aware of the issue and is ""working on it.""  Another model issue is the brakes.  Very loud in cold weather and snow and they are ""developing"" a replacement pad that won't be ready until March 05 (I'm on the ""list"").  Lastly, horrible gas mileage!"
mercury,mariner,2005,MIke, 02/20/2005,A good ride,4,"A solid small SUV.  Nice looking styling in and out.  The only drawbacks (So far) are the high door sills and the very poor fuel economy, 15 city, 20 on the interstate, but a good 25 at 60 mph."
mercury,mariner,2005,sheila, 02/20/2005,my little fun suv,4,I have had this car since the 31st of december and have had a ball driving it handles very well and really enjoy the heated seats on cold mornings.  Would like the suv more if it had a navigational system or onstar available on ford products. 
mercury,mariner,2005,a. skoutas, 03/05/2005,I soooo love it!!,4,"I'm lovin this car! The interior is as roomy as my husband's Jeep GC, but so much smaller! I traded in a Volvo that I loved, but I am not missing it! This vehicle is my perfect ""mommy-mobile,"" but I still feel very stylish in it. It holds the 2 carseats plus another person well in the back, and the front is very roomy. The pick-up is substantial, the AWD works great in the Cleveland winter, and it handles like a small car. It is comfortable to drive and the ride is quite smooth. I Absolutely love it!"
mercury,mariner,2005,Brad Moats, 03/11/2005,Mercury Mariner,4,"We just bought this car and we love it.  It is the perfect size for us, plenty of room in the back, the V6 engine is powerful.  I would recommend it to anyone."
mercury,mariner,2005,SGman, 03/12/2005,The Perfect Car,4,"My Mariner is the perfect car.  It has more features for a great price than I ever expected.  The interior looks like a European luxury car.  Nobody in my family can believe how quick this car is.  The exterior is great, with the brushed chrome detailing.  No problems with the ice and snow, and it heats up in minutes.  All in all, I am using a lot of gas because I can't stay out of it.  The gas mileage isn't the greatest, but neither are most SUV's.  Even my 6ft.3' brother doesn't complain about the room.  My Mariner is the perfect car!"
mercury,mariner,2005,Erik, 03/12/2005,2005 Mariner,5,"It has great visibility.  The ride is fantastic, more like a car than a traditional SUV.  I have a little trouble with seating comfort, I feel like there's no where to rest my arms.  It really has good get up and much better mileage than my old SUV."
mercury,mariner,2005,chas wright, 04/08/2005,a neat little suv.,4,performance comfort and handling all excellent for a suv. cannot fault anything except fuel economy and size of fuel tank. I drove houston to miami shortly after purchase and it felt like I had to stop at almost every gas station. w/o a/c on the trip average was less than 21.5 mpg. this is considerably less than advertised.Otherwise a driver friendly super little vehicle with excellent ride.
mercury,mariner,2005,burgbits, 05/05/2005,Mariners Many Assets,5,I purchased this vehicle for my wife.  She felt much more comfortable test driving it than our 10 year old explorer.  The vehicle handles great and the 4 wheel independent suspension makes the ride extemely stable.  Our Mariner is fun to drive and extremely quiet. Also impressive is the Mach 6 sound system & 2 tone leather seating. 
mercury,mariner,2005,Joe , 07/15/2005,Great Value Decent Performance,4,"Ok - so we needed an SUV at our vacation home - Ford came out with the employee pricing and we took a Luxury FWD with a roof rack off the lot - yes, 'Out the Door"" for $19,500 - including tax, license, dealer junk fees, prep, salesman commissions etc etc.  The standard V6 auto luxury pkg., no options except the roof rack.  Adequate performance [I own a Porsche and the wife a Saab], great vision out the front, decent seats, CD player, buy one now with ee pricing &  $2000 rebate."
mercury,mariner,2005,jason, 07/18/2005,not bad at all,4,just purchased the mariner under the ford family plan. seemed like a good deal. we are pretty happy with the upscale look of this suv. handles well. roomy for a mini-suv. gas mileage is probably the only major weakness with this suv.
mercury,mariner,2005,JAC, 07/29/2005,Go buy one,5,"Me and my wife just bought a Mariner and we love it.  This is  our first SUV.  It has great visibility, and is roomy.  Has good pick up with the V6, and rides nice.  It looks good inside and out.  If your looking to get a small/mid size SUV check out the Mariner.  "
mercury,mariner,2005,rosie, 08/01/2005,I like it-i really like it,4,i have had my mariner for 8 months and have had no problems with it at all. I find it a little noisy on hard acceleration and somewhat lacking in power but overall a very good and comfortable suv. I bought this as a winter replacement for my corvette but i find i'm driving it a lot this summer too. 
mercury,mariner,2005,DGM, 08/08/2005,Great Value,4,Bought this SUV for my teenage daughters. The 4 cyl is a good choice for young drivers. the optional side and canopy airbags are worth the extra money to protect them. A great value for the money and also looks great. 
mercury,mariner,2005,Cord in Texas, 09/01/2005,Luxury in Texas,4,"I just purchase the Premiere AWD V6 Mariner.  Triple black with all ""chrome"" appearance.  This vehicle is the Navigator of Compact SUV's.  My coworker who drives the Porsche Cayenne, was shocked at the quality and cost of this SUV.  Mileage was 16- 18 but I just busted 3k at the end of the month and the new tank is half way gone with 22 mpg average 50 city 50 hwy.  Now, the rearview mirriors not being the body color are kind of not as aesthetically appeasing.  There are some rooms for more improvement but hey 22k for fully loaded, no brainer!  However in two more models I am sure all qualities of the Navigator will be reflected onto the Mariner.   I am 25 years old a 1st time buyer."
mercury,mariner,2005,I like my Mariner 05, 09/06/2005,Love this suv,4,I like the style of the body and the interior. I have gotten about 26 mpg on freeway and about 14mpg city. I like the cd player and the close controls for everything. The acceleration for a six cylinder is impressive. There is some road noise at higher speeds and the computer for mileage is not real accurate but overall does pretty good with mpg.
mercury,mariner,2005,Melody, 03/06/2006,My Mercury Mariner,4,"In April of 2005, my family purchased a Premier Edition Mercury Mariner.  We love it. It is a fun to drive vehicle and is an easy keeper.  It is roomy and has a plush black leather interior with all the bells and whistles, including a sunroof, premium sound system and heated seats.  It is a joy to own."
mercury,mariner,2005,Sean Jester, 03/18/2006,I love it,4,"7 months in, I haven't had a problem. Looks much nicer than the Escape or Tribute. Mercury has done an excellent job making the interior of their vehicles look very upscale. The engine has problems finding a gear and revs loudly a lot, but overall the ride is smooth and quiet at cruising speeds. Love the space, can easily fit 5 adults and luggage at the same time, however folding rear seats down can be a pain and over time could damage the leather. The suede seat insets are already getting dirty and I don't know how to clean them. CD/Stereo w/sub sounds great -- better than wife's Accord. Gas mileage is poor, but gas tank is small so it won't kill your wallet to fill up."
mercury,mariner,2005,Patrick, 08/29/2006,Great vehicle,4,Have had this vehicle 18 months without any warrenty service.  With the 4 cyl. engine I routinely get 26-28 mpg highway.  An attractive vehicle for which I get lots of compliments.  
mercury,mariner,2005,Perfect Blue, 08/15/2007,Perfect Blue,4,We looked a long time trying to decide between more pricey luxury brands and more basic offerings like the Escape. As soon as I saw the Mariner I knew it was the perfect compromise and bought it. I could not have made a better choice. Fully loaded it offers all the extras but with a very affordable price. It has been fun to drive and has not presented any maintenance problems. I only wish they offered the Navigation system offered with newer models.  
mercury,mariner,2005,Carole, 09/23/2007,Mariner's a Great Catch!,4,"My Mariner is a great SUV. It is sporty in its driving feel and very nice looking. The steering is crisp and precise, and the turning is tight.  I would recommend this car to anyone who loves SUVs and enjoys a well built and designed car."
mercury,mariner,2006,Bill W, 06/29/2016,"Still Rolling Along @ 371,538 Miles",4,"I am the original owner of my 2006 Mercury Mariner SUV (4 Cylinder / 4WD).  I purchased it brand new back in 2006.  It has been my daily driver to and from work, I drive 92 miles each way in good weather and bad weather.  I wanted to share my feelings, this has got to be the BEST VEHICLE that I ever purchased.  I am very proactive on maintaining my vehicle, I have changed the oil every 5k miles along with tire rotations, knock on wood that I have not really had anything major happen since buying it other than replacing the tires, front brakes, back brakes only 1X, the serpentine belt 1x, plugs 2x, the battery 1x, the windshield from a stone crack, the alternator 1x, wiper blades many times and the AC Compressor just died, no biggie ..... Also back in 2010 I got rear ended and I thought the insurance company would have considered it a total loss, they ended up paying more for repairs that the value of the vehicle, crazy !  My paint is smooth as glass and the interior is pretty much mint, I really keep it detailed all the time !  Mercury did a great job on the build on this vehicle, I would purchase another if they continued selling them, but the product line got the axe.  The engine runs awesome and the transmission is perfect !  Yes, I had the fluid drained from the tranny 2x, no pressure flush, just a drain and fill, same with radiator, no pressure flush, just drain and fill, fluids always look clean.  Thank You, Mercury !

mercury,mariner,2006,Robert, 04/09/2016,On its final legs for trade-in ;-(,4,"I owned the Mariner new in 2006. I had only one problem while it was still under warranty and it was the lift gate door window lock. Around the 148K mark, I had ongoing repairs list. I had the ignition coils on two cylinders go and plus the computer go bad which caused the short. This was two years ago and cost me about 2K. Along the way till now I had exhaust leak, power steering pump replacement, two ball joints and three battery replacements. 

This weekend, the #1 cylinder was miss-firing and took it to the mechanic for repairs. He found a low pressure reading on the cylinder head and replaced the spark-plugs. He also cleaned the valve heads and it regained compression in the cylinder. Two days later, I get the code for a bad ignition coil on number 4 and a bad computer again. It is now time to say good bye to the beloved Mercury Mariner. I had a great running truck for the last 10 years and it lasted pretty long with the general preventive maintenance schedule. FYI  Never got stuck in the snow in Philadelphia.

I was weary about buying a used vehicle (seeing that I bought my first car brand new) but I LOVE THIS SUV!! I ditched the JUNK Continental tires that all these Escapes and Mariners come with from the factory and got Michelin Cross Terrain's put on. Night and Day!  Get compliments on the interior all the time (two-tone black and creme).  Average 19-20 mpg in mostly highway driving and it does have some power behind it.  Have put on 19,000 miles in just 8 months and it has been rock solid! (now at 57,000 miles)"
mercury,mariner,2006,lake girl, 11/06/2006,Still wondering,3,"Nice looking vehicle. In 2 months of ownership have had a problem with CD player- reading no Cd  when there was one in player. Turning vehicle off and on again luckily corrected the problem. Muffler seems rather loose, but service dept says free play is normal. Makes a lot of creaking noise when backing up onto the road- live on a hill. Gas mileage Ok for an SUV. Not the greatest on zip going uphill- got to put the pedal to the floor for some zoom."
mercury,mariner,2006,Ariel, 12/12/2006,Tire noise will drive you crazy,3,"My husband drives an F-150 SuperCrew and it sounds like a quiet luxury vehicle compared to my Mariner.  Also, I am disappointed with the lack of illumination on key controls for night driving.  Unless  you memorize all the controls, you are s.o.l. after dark.  I had more illumination on my 10 year old Dodge Caravan."
mercury,mariner,2006,Nic, 11/04/2006,Nice roomy small suv,4,Great small suv and very good looking.  Lots of wind noise on the highway.  Metal seems thin on exterior.  Windows make a clanging noise when closing them.  Base of door sits on an outer ledge that just traps dirt.  
mercury,mariner,2006,Happy Owner, 09/12/2010,Great Small SUV,5,"This has been a great little SUV. I used to drive Explorers. Bought this to get better gas millage for a Minneapolis driving.

Love the radio/6cd player, and leather. Love it Love it Love it. I would recommend to anyone"
mercury,mariner,2006,AtlantaMariner, 07/30/2008,Practical and Dependable,3,"I bought this car fresh out of college in 2006 and so far, no complaints. This is not the flashiest car on the road, but there are several times when I pat myself on the back for choosing this one. I disagree with any owner that criticizes engine power because for the size and amount of money, this thing has some punch to it. I am approaching 40,000 miles and I have had no mechanical issues what-so-ever. Overall, I rate this car very dependable, practical and a great every-day ride. My best friend even bought one because she liked mine. "
mercury,mariner,2006,dr, 08/02/2008,Great mid-size suv,4,Bought this SUV brand new. Ride is very good. Handles well. I live on west side of Michigan where we get a ton of lake-effect snow. The AWD is great in winter. Only couple of small negatives: road noise-possibly due to the stock Continental tires and I wish gas mileage was a little better. 
mercury,mariner,2006,trublkkngt, 01/01/2011,Happy Mariner Owner,4,"We've been happy with our Mercury Mariner Premier.
We bought it used in 08 with 9000 miles on it.
It has been very reliable! No maintenance or repair issues.
It's perfect to haul our two small children around.
The only complaint we ever had was how LOUD the stock Continental tires were.
We replaced them with General Grabber HTS tires and it significantly improved the ride quailty.
If you have a Mariner, Escape or Tribute, do yourself a favor and dump the stock Continitental Tires as soon as you can!"
mercury,mariner,2006,Angela, 08/17/2006,Fun and comfortable to drive,4,"This is our 3rd murcury and from coming out of the Monterey to the Mairiner there is a world of difference.  It drives more like a car and handles like one too...and did I mention comfort!  We have the premier with the leather and leather heated seats and I totally recommend it.  The gas mileage isn't all that bad, we are getting 18 mpg in the city which actually is the same that we were getting with a mini-van.  I totally recommend this suv."
mercury,mariner,2006,Manitoba424, 08/23/2005,Love My Mariner,4,This is one of the best cars I have owned.  I love the luxurious feel of the interior.  It feels like I'm in an upscale SUV and it's a Mercury!  I have had an Escape and the Mariner is so much nicer.  I can't say enough good things about this car.  The V6 has loads of power.  My only drawback is the gas mileage - but it's an SUV so what do you expect?!
mercury,mariner,2006,Hans P., 09/11/2006,listen up!!,4,I drove a Dodge Ram pickup for 5 yrs. After all this gas price scam the American public was falling victim to I finally bought a car that is easy on my wallet. The Mariner rides great and handles well. The gas mileage is a litle less than advertised. But that depends on ones drivng habits. The only thing I didnt really like was that looking out the rear view mirror is a challege due to the rear seat headrests are in the way. Sooooo I was able to remove them and the rear view is much better.It has a great sound system with a 6 CD changer. 
mercury,mariner,2006,Crystal, 11/05/2006,Great Car,5,"Great car to drive. Comfortable, hugs the road, quiet and fun. Got the Moon roof worth the extra. Getting 27 back and forth (12 miles) to work and 31+ on interstate driving. "
mercury,mariner,2006,9102, 03/30/2013,transmission problems,3,"Car was great for the first 3 years then at 78,000 miles and all at once the front and rear differential went out, rear main oil seal was leaking, exhaust manifold leaking and an a/c line was leaking. $ 4800.00 later it seems to be all fixed. I really hope there are no more issues with this vehicle. I have never been a big fan of Ford products to begin with. Better off staying with the foreign brand vehicles, they seem to know how to make them last."
mercury,mariner,2006,MechanicalAnimal, 11/05/2008,A Non so likeable SUV,3,"I leased our 2006 Mariner for my wife in 2006 in an effort to find a more economical replacement for her 2003 Nissan Pathfinder. I thought she would be able to live with a smaller sized four-cylinder SUV. I was sorely mistaken. She almost immediately complained about the lack of power. After spending time behind the wheel myself, I must admit the engine is not powerful enough for that size/weight vehicle. Furthermore the brakes are substandard in wet conditions and the gas tank is too small which results in having to hit the gas station more often than one would like.  Overall not a fun vehicle to drive. My first (and probably last) Ford Motor Company product.  "
mercury,mariner,2006,markm, 04/05/2009,rear differential,2,"lease 3 vehicles all mercury's.my 2006 mariner has by far been the worst lease in last 10 years.after rotating tires,then purchasing 4 new ones,still road as if i had snow tires .sound was loud u couldn't have conversation. rear differential was replaced under warranty. 15 miles out of service dept rear fell out -almost got killed after swerving into oncomming traffic. lets see if ford reads these reviews!

mercury,mariner,2006,Nick, 10/16/2009,Lovin My Mariner!,4,"Bought 4 months ago with 38K miles, just clicked over to 50K today! Took two trips to South Carolina (about 1600 miles roundtrip) and averaged 23 MPG with cruise set between 70-80mph.  Got rid of the JUNK stock Continentals and bought All-Terrain tires with a high treadwear rating. Difference between these and the Continentals is night and day! Love the interior (black and creme tu-tone) and get compliments on it all the time. Would buy again for sure. Radio is fantastic,and the keypad entry is great for those times when you don't want to carry your keys with you! Only major complaint is the lack of available power after 55 MPH and not being able to get more than 275-280 miles/tank. "
mercury,mariner,2006,A_MAN_in _VA., 02/17/2010,A Mercury Story,4,"I recently purchased this vehicle, used  from the local dealership, and found it to be a cute little vehicle.  I liked the stylings, but after having a Ford Ranger XLT that had the Overdrive Off button flashing, and knowing the troubles that it could bring first hand, I was displeased. I was so hoping to get a vehicle made by Ford that did not have this button.  It really serves no purpose in holding back downhill.  I prefer to leave it in the normal position.  I have heard some loud noises from the transmission. This makes me wonder why its clunking so hard.  I do know it is fun to drive, but I still worry it could let me down someday in the future."
mercury,mariner,2006,Rough Rider!, 06/30/2010,Be Prepared for a Rough Ride,3,"Bought this car used and was very impressed with the overall style of the the car from first sight. The car runs excellent, sound system meets standards as well. Not very impressed with where the seat warmer buttons are since the passenger seat automatically turns on when someone gets in and the loudness of the car is overwhelming. Takes ALL bumps big or small very hard. There seems to be no give in the suspension or shocks when riding over any thing that disrupts the smoothness in the asphalt. Does not handle water very well either. Likes to hydroplane even in the smallest amount of water.  Not recommended for any type of off roading! Also very poor fuel mileage"
mercury,mariner,2006,Kevin, 05/14/2005,Mariner classy vehicle,5,This car is really a great little SUV  It is fun to drive. It has power to get up and go. The interior is really sharp looking .The body is great looking the front of it with all the chrome makes it look that much more classy . Try it you will like it.
mercury,mariner,2006,superjohn, 05/14/2005,A Great Safe SUV,5,Very comfortable seats they have 14 gel packs in the seats to make the best fit.  lots of pwr and great on gas.  lots of options and a great deal .  thanks
mercury,mariner,2006,Debbie A., 09/22/2005,Mercury Mariner,4,"Nice exterior - I have the red with the beige interior (would have been much better if gray interior was offered), handles well,"
mercury,mariner,2006,DOOBDOO, 01/03/2006,Buy it!,4,"We have a 2005 Equinox & just got the 2006 Mariner. Go for the Merc. The Noxi has electronic steering (no fluid) that makes it handle like the Queen Mary in a turn - no feel whatsoever. The Mariner is a luxury car that is fun to drive. I am coming out of an Aviator and 19 mpg Mariner city driving is doubling what I got, so the fuel economy suits me fine. No built in ""Ford rattle"" - you can see foam inserts in the door jambs in addition to gaskets to eliminate noise. Just finished after Christmas shopping and put two 6' X 2'boxes in the back with lots of room to spare for the shopping bags. Comfortable, too."
mercury,mariner,2006,Jeanne Compagnone, 01/06/2006,Fun & Secure,4,"I really feel secure in the SUV. It's a fun car to drive and extremely easy to handle.  Makes great turns, seems to hug the road.  Added heated seats and rear-sensor monitor.  "
mercury,mariner,2006,Ron W, 01/08/2006,mariner value,5,"We love this vehicle.  My wife actually picked it out.  I've used it to haul cargo with back seats folded down and was amazed at the room inside.  Although it is still quite new so gas mileage probably isn't correct yet, it seems to do very very well on a gallon of gas.                                                        "
mercury,mariner,2006,L Fitt, 02/25/2006,Great Car,4,"Have owned the vehicle for almost 6 months with not a single instance of a problem.  It is a uiet and the ride is great for a smaller SUV.  Owned a Mercury Grand Marquis before and we enjoy this car a much as the other one.  Wish the fuel mileage was better on our 4-cylinder engine, but it is pretty quiet and responsive."
mercury,mariner,2006,Branka, 03/11/2006,A Dream come true,5,"This car is like a dream come true.. I love it... after couple of mini-vans and such a disappointment in Mazda Tribute this is the car I will lease again and again. Easy to drive, very strong engine, comfortable seats... Love the warming seats option... works miracle on my back pain.. has two power outlets... no more fight who will charge the phone first.. or you can use one for phone and other for computer. Huge cargo area... "
mercury,mariner,2006,Dan, 03/23/2006,Love My Mariner,4,Very nice ride. mpg not the best but what do you expect with AWD would like to try the Hybrid next time
mercury,mariner,2006,Crnpeach, 03/30/2006,Love It,4,"After 10 yrs with a mini-van I did not want to move down to a car or up to a large SUV. Then I saw the Mercury Mariner. I love the looks inside and out, the solid color and chrome add a nice touch, no black molding to worry about. Handles great and picks up speed nicely. The Mariner was in the right price range for me. So far so good."
mercury,mariner,2006,Greg in Texas, 04/20/2006,What A Great Small SUV,5,"The Mariner has been a wonderful surpise the first year of ownership. The ride is smooth and being over 6'4"" I can sit in comfort and not feel all cramped in. The Mach stereo system is fantastic and all the controls are at my finger tip. the vehicle has been wonderful on trips to Kansas City to watch Chiefs football games. The gas milage is averaging 23-24 mpg. "
mercury,mariner,2006,Debi, 04/20/2006,New to SUV's,4,"I have owned a Lexus SC400 for the past eight years. After buying a home on a hill and realizing I could not haul anything for the house in my car and when it snowed my car was useless -  I decided it was time to go the SUV route.  Reluctant as I was, I am very happy with my choice of the Mercury Mariner.  So far, I am enjoying the look and feel of the Mariner, the attention to detail in the exterior and interior.  The SUV feels very solid and has a smooth ride.  I am looking forward to the handling of the Mariner in the Seattle rain and snow.  "
mercury,mariner,2006,Chris, 05/07/2006,Cool,4,Smooth Quite ride.  I test drove the 2006 Rav and CRV and found the Mariner to be much more luxurious than others.
mercury,mariner,2006,RichardTanner, 06/01/2006,My best car I ever owned,4,I love the color of my Mariner. I also like the high clearance below me as I go where other cars scrap. My car seems to also hold the road easily. I hope to have it for a long time. I wish this car would have been made before .My last Mercury was a villager.I liked it too. The sound system is really great as I don't ever remember a better radio/CD player in previous cars.We are planning a long trip this summer in the Mariner. Richard
mercury,mariner,2006,NEIL THE THRILL, 06/01/2006,My first suv,4,I drove to delray beach about 700 mi. And 12 hr in the seat the mariner was a pleasure to drive. The mileage was 27 mi per gallon .The four cylinder engine had plenty of power running on the turnpike at 70 or 80.This little suv offers more for the money than the imports.
mercury,mariner,2006,Peacock, 07/24/2006,Peacock Process,4,"I like everything about this car, except the mileage.  Wish that I had bought a hybrid, as I'm doing a lot of driving.  I was told that it would pay for itself, but the cost of gasoline has risen dramatically since I bought this car, and I'm reconsidering my choice of car.  20 - 22 mpg in town, and 22-24 mpg on the road. "
mercury,mariner,2006,Peggy, 07/25/2006,2006 Mercury Mariner,4,"This was the best deal on a vehicle all the way around. I commute 3-4 hours per day and didn't feel safe on the freeways in my 4-cylinder. This car was top on the safety list for it's class and I can see why. It's sturdy, not too big, has a luxury interior, and good options. Handles well in traffic.  I looked at the Ford Escape which uses the same body, but the interior was very cheap, using plastic instead of chrome for the buttons and console areas.  The fact that I got it loaded for 0% interest and $1,000 rebate made my purchase even sweeter."
mercury,mariner,2006,FearlessBear, 05/23/2005,Mariner is a Great Vehicle,4,"Great ride, great comfort, excellent handling and good performance.  A bit of a gas drinker, but not really bad, and it takes regular.  I have driven Jeep Grand Cherokees, Land Rovers, Suzuki, but this vehicle is better.  Its ideal in size, style, comfort, roominess and performance.  "
mercury,mariner,2006,Sue, 08/06/2005,Awesome !,4,"Great little SUV.  Terrific pick-up and handling.  I traded in a Mercedes for this and have no regrets.  Elegant styling and trim. Gorgeous, luxe, comfy leather interior. Rich exterior colors - - had trouble deciding on which one. "
mercury,mariner,2006,vanz73, 09/06/2005,Great Price Near Luxury - Power ?s,4,"A good choice for someone who wants a nice vehicle at a very reasonable price-a good small SUV for the city driver. I would not recommend if you are a driver who likes a little power in reserve for maneuvering - this vehicle picks bad times to disappoint on the power curve (i.e. changing lanes or making left turns between traffic). I figure Ill learn the how to get the most from the CVT transmission, but performance is lacking for a people who know how to drive. Still a good family vehicle, sturdy, and overall nice to drive (exception noted). Well keep it because overall for the price we got a lot of vehicle compared to Toyota Highlander, RAV4, Nissan Murano, etc. "
mercury,mariner,2006,R. Vondenberger, 10/07/2005,Love the Mariner,5,This is the best car I have ever driven. It handles very easy. Very comfortable. Room enough for family and has room for lots of things. It has alot of power. Love driving it. Looks are excellent size is perfect.
mercury,mariner,2006,Mike, 11/15/2005,My Mercury,4,Not a bad SUV except for the lack of outside temp and reading lights for passengers. This unit is the first Ford product I have ever owned and I am not sure it is not the last. I traded in a 2005 Equinox for it and am not sure it was a good trade.  The equinox outside temp. and reading lights for the passengers also more room and easier to get in and out of.  The flat floor pan made getting in and out easy. Did not like the Contential tires that came on it either.  They were noisy and road hard.            
mercury,mariner,2006,Noel, 01/26/2006,Nice small SUV for the price,4,A comfortable small SUV with great traction in the snow. It performs well and has good around town MPG
mercury,mariner,2006,twake26, 01/28/2006,I love the Mariner,4,"I have had the Mariner for approximately a month now and I love it. I really like the sound system and how high you sit up. I traded in my 03 Mazda Protege 5. The gas mileage is worse, but I knew going from a wagon to this, it wasn't going to get better, so the MPG doesn't bother me. I like how everything is in reach for me and I like how you have to outlets for cell phones, cigarette lighters, etc. The storage compartments could have been a little bigger. I liked the cloth on the seats. The two-tone is very eye-catching.I also love the chrome on the Mariner. Adds a bit of class."
mercury,mariner,2006,C. Caban, 02/16/2006,Great Vehicle!,4,"I have had my Mariner for about 2 weeks now.  I traded a Malibu for it.  I love how high I sit and how well I can reach the dash and all my accessories easily.  I love how well it handles.  I drive highways and when I put it on cruise control my gas mileage gets better.  I am running considerably lower than what the sticker says, but it will take it a while to break it in.  I love the modern design inside and outside.  The chrome accents make me want to sing the country song.  LOL.  Fun SUV and overall really great!"
mercury,mariner,2006,LaChellelv, 02/16/2006,Love My New Truck!!!!,4,"I've always wanted a truck, but didn't want to feel like I was driving a boat!! My Mariner is just PERFECT for people starting out with a truck. I love almost everything about it. Gas mileage could be better, but hey its a truck so you really can't expect a lot! Its sporty and stylish!!!! Real cute :o)"
mercury,mariner,2006,Chuck, 03/16/2006,"Classy little truck, don't pass it up",4,"Overall impression: The exterior of this truck is outstanding.The front and rear fascia make this vehicle classy. Mercury did a great job separating this from the Escape. The interior is equally impressive. The black leather with tan suede inserts steals the show. Truck drives very well, very comfortable, only detractors are tire/driveline noise but it's not too bad. You really won't hear it since you will have the mach 360 stereo turned up! Gas mileage is not up to par, hopefully it will improve with more miles on it (averaging 17 mpg city so far)."
mercury,mariner,2006,Rice, 03/20/2006,I Love it!!,4,Just purchased my Mariner and absolutely love it! I have the Premier model with all the toys. Can't wait for warmer weather to use the sun roof. I did alot of research and drove several different vehicles upon making my decision. Same gas mileage as the van I traded in so no real complaints there either.
mercury,mariner,2006,Noel, 03/19/2006,Excellent midsize SUV,5,"I traded a Dodge Dakota and a PT Cruiser in for the Mercury and am completely satisfied. It handles like a sports sedan, gets reasonable mileage, and is very comfortable. It is one of the few SUV's that include crossbars on the roof rack "
mercury,mariner,2006,M, 05/25/2006,2006 Mariner Premier,4,"Drives nice, will be even better when the dealership can balance the tires so that the tire warning will go off and the wheel won't shimmy at 55 mph"
mercury,mariner,2006,K-Shizzle, 05/26/2006,2006 Mariner a real joy to own,4,A true joy of a car to own and drive.  A real plus is the fact that you'll see 50 Escapes to your 1 Mariner.  All Escape owners shirk as they notice the classy styling of the upgraded Mariner.  
mercury,mariner,2006,Ev, 05/27/2006,"My Mariner, A Classic on its Own!!!!!!!!",5,"Mercury Mariner is like the Ford Escape but with jewelry on it! The driving & steering are phenomenal. My Mariner  hugs the roads & I could hardly feel it sway when making turns. The interior is very classy! One hardly has to press on the accelerator on my V6 without feeling its power. The seats are very comfortable & I like the fact that the back seats are higher than the front, making visibility for my back passengers easier. The moonroof is quite large. I do not like driving through heavy rain but I never felt so secure driving my Mariner through a rainstorm that I am confident she could securely drive through any weather conditions! My Lt. Tundra Mariner has everyone turning!"
mercury,mariner,2006,Sarah, 05/31/2006,Best small SUV,4,"I shopped all around and almost bought a Jeep, and now looking back I'm so glad that didn't work out! I tend to have a short liking to car and always look for change, but I love this SUV! It has great space, fuel is alright (after all it is a SUV) the only thing I would change is that there is no thermostat in the control center. Other than that I tell everyone to buy one! "
mercury,mariner,2006,TPATRO, 06/11/2006,Great CUV for the price and package,5,I love this CUV. Drives great like a car. Have not any single issue so far. I also have an aftermarket Navigation system. Can't ask for anyhting better!
mercury,mariner,2006,NZ, 06/26/2006,"Not the Best, but Good",4,"Our Mercury Mariner is a good SUV. We've had no problems with it in our 3 months of having it. It's fun to drive and is comfortable for its price tag. It has okay fuel economy (there's other small SUVs with better fuel economy). We get about 20 miles per gallon overall.    I am very happy with the interior room it has. I've been in a Jeep Liberty and I love the fact that I can stretch out more in the Mariner. The leather seats are firm, but can be irritating at times.   The Mariner is a nice affordable small SUV. If your in the market for a small SUV, look at this one!     "
mercury,mariner,2006,lvnorte, 06/23/2006,A lot of car for the buck,5,"My wife recently wanted a every day small SUV that got good gas mileage She looked at all of the small SUV's in the market including the BMW X3. She was thinking about a Ford Escape and one look at the Mercury Mariner changed all of that. For the price difference which is not much the Mariner has many extra features that make it much more luxurious. Trading from a 740i BMW was a difficult choice, however the premier Mariner was what mife decided she wanted and she has not been disappointed. The vehicle is nice to look at has good performance and economy"
mercury,mariner,2006,NZ, 08/11/2006,Update for Our 2006 Mariner,4,"The Mariner has been a very practical vehicle with its roominess and reliability. We already have 16,000 miles on it and we're finding that the more miles it has on it, the worse road noise gets. Also, there's not many places to store things. There's two small overhead bins, a small in- console ""cubby"", and two cupholders up front. It's an average vehicle. I'm sure there are better alternatives."
mercury,mariner,2006,Ralph from Delaware, 01/28/2007,SUV Lite,3,"Quality vehicle with nice features.  We replaced a Ford Escape, moving up in amenities with the Mercury.  But the full-time 4WD burns gas.  We average 15-20 MPG around town, 20-25 MPG on the open road - much worse than the Escape [which allowed us to switch from 4WD to front drive to save gas].  Also the Mariner is noticeably heavier and slower than the Escape with the same engine and transmission.  Wish we had opted for the Hybrid! The standard tires are cheap - yielding a rough ride with lots of road noise, contributing to the poor gas mileage, and handling is not the best.  Ford could have spent another $50 bucks per tire for Michelins and would have had a much better performing car."
mercury,mariner,2006,John Holkmes, 03/08/2007,Better Gas Milage Please,3,I actually love the Mercury Mariner except when I was driving back from my brother's house last weekend the check engine light came on and the system monitor stated that there was an emission system problem and to push the start button to clear it so that is what I did and ever since I have been getting terrible fuel economy between 16 and 17 mpg when I should be getting 22 to 24 mpg I am not happy with the fuel economy.
mercury,mariner,2006,Unhappy, 03/13/2007,Unhappy,2,We purchased the Mariner over the Escape because of the nicer interior.  The light grey seats seem to hold water stains and other stains and do not clean well.  We have a very bad squeak on the rear left side - and driver's side window squeaks loudly when opened. Disappointed.
mercury,mariner,2006,Car Guy, 03/15/2007,An Okay SUV,4,"At first, we were very happy with our Mariner. It had the nice heated leather seats, Intelligent-4WD system, and a roomy interior. However, it has gotten to a point where road noise is nearly unbearable, wind noise is too noticeable, and nearly every bump we go over is transmitted into the cabin. On the plus side, we are getting 21.5 miles per gallon, we get good comments about its exterior, and it has good handling. If you want a practical SUV, the Mariner is a good choice. If you want a comfortable SUV, look at another one. "
mercury,mariner,2006,peter1438, 04/02/2007,2006 Mariner Premium 4WD,4,"I went into this vehicle from an '05 VW Touareg and what I expected was to find a basic American truck that would be breaking down left and right. I was mistaken and I am very impressed with the Mercury, I am now thinking that the VW was the problem child. The interior is very well done, except for the cookie cutter central dash. The seats front and rear are very well done and quite comfy. I have had zero issues with the vehicle and the on road performance has been terrific. It's very nimble to control in heavy NYC traffic, terrific brakes and very good get up and go. I would highly recommend this vehicle over many foreign brands. American vehicles have caught up and surpassed."
mercury,mariner,2006,cn03684, 03/30/2007,Awesome Vehicle,5,"This is a great SUV. Has excellent gas mileage compared to other SUV's in it's class. Plenty of room all around and the two toned seats make a nice touch for inside decor. Fun to drive, no complaints. Hats off to Mercury on this one, best vehicle I've ever had!   "
mercury,mariner,2006,vanz73, 07/11/2007,Not Up to Par,3,This is an okay vehicle after 20K miles. My prior vehicles were a Ford Explorer and Expedition. I loved both of these. The Mariner is decent. Low priced compared to competitors (about $3K less than the Japanese models). Would I buy it again? No.  The continuously variable transmission robs a great deal of power from the engine. It has had several issues that were covered by warranty except one that the mechanic has yet to fix (the gas pump keeps turning off before it is full even at the slowest setting). The vehicle often struggles trying to accelerate at highway speeds (40 to 70 mph range). 
mercury,mariner,2006,poppy joe, 03/26/2009,this is a great mazda (mercury),5,this was a really great suv i hauled flowers and pottery for three years and never lost a days work  easy to get in and out of small spaces with i would like to keep it 
mercury,mariner,2006,Stacy, 11/11/2009,What did I do????,3,"I bought this vehicle 3 weeks ago, and am thinking I may have made a big mistake.  I traded in my 2004 Toyota corolla with 26,000 miles for this vehicle 2 years newer with 53,000 miles.  Typical woman I was cuz I took one look at it and thought it was SO CUTE!!!!  Plus, I always wanted a little SUV.  A week and a half after I got it, I needed a new Alternator.  Now, my husband thinks I have a small oil leak.  I guess time will tell.  I do know that someone must have gotten a great little toyota.  Never had any problems with that car!!  Oh well, ladies, don't be fooled by the cuteness!!"

mercury,mariner,2006,Lyn, 11/10/2005,Not my best choice,2,"3 months have passed since I bought my new Mercury Mariner. Not especially crazy about the vehicle.  Somethings may not seem important but it is the little things that count. Do not like the hidden ignition.  Very hard to find since there is no light to help find it, especially in a black interior car. I will put glow in the dark nail polish on the rim of the ignition. No lite under the hood. Car is very noisy. Could have used some sound insulation in the body of the car. The biggest problem I have had is the front end pulling to the left. Have taken it in 3 times. Have heard others with the same dangerous problem. Would I buy again? No!"
mercury,mariner,2006,EP, 09/10/2006,It's Okay,4,"I've had our Mariner for 5 months and it's okay.  I'm tall and I have plenty of head and leg room.  The exterior looks great, and it does good on poor road conditions.  However, the back latch went out after only 3,000 miles...not impressive.  The center console is structurally weak.  If I push it from the side a little, it will deflect and creak.  You must memorize the cruise control buttons if you use them at night because they are not lighted.  Overall, it is a good looking car with poor quality."
mercury,mariner,2006,Ryan Rankin, 07/29/2018,Great car for small distances,3,"Check oil and transmission often!!!
"
mercury,mariner,2006,msass, 12/17/2008,Great SUV,4,"Overall this is a great vehicle.  I have only had one major problem (with the cd player) and it was covered by the warranty. Very comfortable to drive, good pick up, great AWD!  Handles very well in the snow, especially compared to the 2wd model."
mercury,mariner,2006,A King , 05/29/2009,Luv my 06 Mariner,4,"I've had my Mariner for 3 1/2 yrs and like it so far. This is my 1st SUV and now I can't go back to a car. Love the decor, style, sunroof and stereo system. Can't support more than 4 passengers comfortably but that's ok with me. Has loud road noise and brake problems (weird sounds), took to dealer and was told everything was fine. Backseat headrest are bad, blocks view. Needs improvement in lowering back seats. Oh, please include more on steering controls for convenience and handling. These are things I can live with but think should be addressed. Looking forward to my next Mariner fully loaded!! "
mercury,mariner,2006,R . Klein, 05/15/2005,2005 Mariner,4,"Since buying this vehicle, I have had fun driving it. The gas mileage has been a little low, (1 or 2 miles per gallon difference) compared to my previous vehicle, a 1999 Ford Taraus. I contirbute this to the winter weather, and the newness of the vehicle. Also there is a difference in driving a SUV vs a car, which I haven't quite mastered as of yet. "
mercury,mariner,2006,dre, 07/26/2005,You'd be fool not to buy one,5,"So far it's been a great suv. We've driven it in some severe waether conditions such as flooding and it handled quite well! Hasn't seen snow yet! It's also a very comfortable vehicle,if you get the premier it's more luxury than sporty!"
mercury,mariner,2006,Mike Focar, 10/12/2005,Run-A-Bout,4,"Great for local driving, has a lot of pep, a great size and handles well. On the highway however, it's another story. You feel the limits of it's V6. It churns and grinds when you try to get it up to speed quickly. But once up to speed it's fine. I am very disappointed in the Malano's lack of mid-range power."
mercury,mariner,2006,bill, 01/25/2009,Big disappointment,2,"It's like driving a basketball, mileage isn't what it supposed to get and a typical Ford with brakes. I can't wait to give it back."
mercury,mariner,2006,Jason, 03/30/2010,Worst vehicle I've ever owned,2,"Seriously the worst vehicle I have ever had.  40,000 miles the transmission blew and needed a completely new one with no help from Ford due to the warranty ending at 36K.  Now the front end is starting to go and the brakes are shot.  I can't wait to get rid of this car."
mercury,mariner,2006,len.adler, 05/12/2008,2006 Mercury Mariner Premier,4,"Since delivery this car has been fun to drive, and without mechanical defect. It's higher position enables seeing over sedans in a traffic line. It is nimble and comfortable. The mpg average of 20-25 on the highway is disappointing in today's gasoline prices. Five passengers can travel comfortably, and the back section is great for our black lab, even on long trips."
mercury,mariner,2007,Gretchen, 11/07/2006,Love My Mariner,4,"Having had a full size SUV, I like the more nimble, smaller Mariner.  It is easy to maneuver, peppy, and fuel efficient.  I have the rear sensor and heated seats plus keyless entry....what more could I ask for?"
mercury,mariner,2007,Stephen from CT, 08/20/2006,Great Small SUV,4,"I had been considering the Mariner for about six months now, comparing it intensly to the Ford Escape and the Honda CR-V. But then my son had said he stopped by our local Lincoln Mercury dealer and said they had one fully loaded V-6 with AWD left. AS it turned out, I bought the car the next day. Great Handling SUV, handles much like a car and is easier to maneuver in parking than my Chevrolet Impala. The interior is very tastefully done and I love the 6-disc CD Changer and the Audiophile sound system. Rides very comfortably and the V-6 is deceptively fast. You quickly find yourself speeding in this vehicle mostly because the engine doesn't rev that hard to get up to speed."
mercury,mariner,2007,Tom Walsh, 07/25/2006,Fun to Drive,5,I love the truly keyless entry where you cannot lock yourself out of the car. It has great pickup when entering traffic. I also like sitting higher than my previous SW.
mercury,mariner,2007,Mike, 05/13/2010,Noises,3,Nice little SUV to drive but the road noise gets on my nerves. Dealer tried new tires but they did little or nothing to help the problem. Also was surprised at the disappointing mileage. The readout states 19.5 mpg while city driving but the gas tank sure seems to empty fast. 
mercury,mariner,2007,gtsfreak, 03/04/2013,The Good The Bad & The Ugly,3,"Bought this car used with 30K + miles on it from local Ford dealer. Although it has run pretty good for two years, I am now experiencing ABS light problem, but I'm getting ahead of myself. This V-6 is extremely responsive. It fires up every morning... almost revs too much. Makes me wonder if the idle speed is set too high. But she's a mad banshee on the road. Smooth transmission. Seats are comfortable. Interior knobs and features are ok. Some things about this car are bizarre. (e.g. two ways to turn off heat controls. Cannot control direction of air conditioner - It comes out every where! What's with that? Intermittent wiper decal diagrams are reversed.) Audio - OK.
Brakes - suspect. "
mercury,mariner,2007,Mercury, 02/08/2009,First SUV and love it,4,Its my first SUV and I think I made the right choice.  We looked at alot and ended up choosing the Mercury.  I love it.  I've only had it 2 months but we had alot of snow in those 2 months and it handles great. Which is one of the reasons I wanted 4WD.  I haven't had any problems at all with the vehicle.
mercury,mariner,2007,R.Brewster, 08/11/2006,A Great Little SUV,5,"I really wanted an suv, but didn't want to end up spending all my money on gas. I also wanted to be able to get all the fun extras like 4wd, 6 disc cd, leather, moonroof. The Mercury Mariner is a perfect fit for me!!! "
mercury,mariner,2007,Ashley, 12/15/2008,Couldn't ask for more,4,"Sadly, I only had my Mariner for 3 months when I was in an accident and totaled it. Luckily, I walked away with no injuries, which is why I will be purchasing one again. I've never felt more safe in this vehicle. Very comfortable and smooth ride. I loved the extra's: Reverse Assistance, information system, stock AMP, heated leather seats, moonroof, keyless entry."
mercury,mariner,2007,Jamey, 10/14/2006,My Mariner,4,"Very sharp SUV! Love the interior design and chrome exterior accents!  Smooth ride for an SUV, handles great and peppy when you need it.  Leaves a little room for improvement on MPG. I get roughly 300 miles per fill up in the city before im looking for another gas station, give or take 20 miles.  Havent tested hwy mpg.  Overall, very happy with the Mariner so far."
mercury,mariner,2007,mercqwerty, 10/05/2008,This little thing goes,4,"This is one great little SUV. Roomy inside, comfortable and really fun to drive. The AWD goes great in the snow. This Mercury is reliable as sin. "
mercury,mariner,2007,Bradley, 04/29/2008,My 2007 Mercury Mariner,4,"Have had this car for over a year and am still happy with it.  I enjoy the driving, even with a 4cyl it has enough pep for me.  Average about 24mpg (better then a 6cyl).  Great interior room, have been able to carry just about everything from my mountain bike to a big screen TV.  Like the exterior design better then the 2008 model.  The interior looks great, not as many features as the 08.  Overall a great car!!"
mercury,mariner,2007,From NEPA, 09/19/2006,Leak,3,I only have 150 miles on the Mariner.  I had it only 2 days when it rained and water gushed in from the moonroof.  It is currently at the dealsership for the second time for repairs on the moonroof.  It is a shame when a person spends hard-earned money only to have the car that he saved for for four years leak from the begining. 
mercury,mariner,2007,aingel, 06/02/2008,"Drip, Drip, Drip...but oh well I love it",4,"This was my first time buying an SUV. Good gas mileage, fun to drive. I bought the black with the black/cream interior. Although it looks sharp, I imagine it will be tough to keep clean even without kids. Roomy, and easy to manuever."
mercury,mariner,2007,Derr, 01/16/2008,07 Mariner,5,"Good visibility, good adjustably seats, no problems, peppy, good brakes, good cargo space for small SUV, tight turning radius, parks easily, good stereo, better than my former 2004 Toyota RAV4."
mercury,mariner,2007,Cheyanne, 12/16/2015,Major transmission AND engine problems,1,"Purchased this car 4 years ago from Kings Ford in Ohio, ABS light came on, Transmission had to be re built AND now I'm having engine problems, highly dissatisfied with this vehicle choice. I need to replace yet ANOTHER MAP sensor.
"
mercury,mariner,2007,ndcysyve, 12/27/2006,Love IT!!!,5,"Just purchased today and I am thrilled. I was hesitant on buying American especially going from a VW to a Mercury but I love it. Very quick, full of pep and its an head turner."
mercury,mariner,2007,PJ, 02/16/2007,Great Value and Style,5,"Love my Mariner.  I handles better than a larger SUV, feels peppy and stylish.  Perfect for trips with the family (and large dog)."
mercury,mariner,2007,Charles McCoin, 03/01/2008,2007 Mercury Marineer,4,Wiper control Switch is a little confusing and takes a while to get used to. Light switch controls are clumsy. Other than these this seems to be a good comfortable vehicle. It would help if it had heated mirrors to keep ice off the mirrors.
mercury,mariner,2007,Michael, 08/02/2018,Tranny Troubles,4,"At only 138488 mileage, the transmission needed servicing which ran me $1,100 to repair. And while researching this problem,  I found that all Ford & Mercury CD4E transmissions within that year range, ran into the same problem of losing it's second and fourth gear. There is also a problem with there neutral safety switch where it won't let you switch easily from park to drive. I believe there is a recall on that switch. Other than that, not too bad a vehicle.
"
mercury,mariner,2007,Mike, 05/30/2020,Great winter car,5,"Winter vehicle for me.  This Merc has 173000 miles on it.   I owned a 2011 and a 2016 Equinox.   I can't say why for sure, but this old Mercury is a more solid vehicle then either Chevy was.   Being a Chevy guy saying that is hard for me.
"
mercury,mariner,2008,Steve, 08/16/2015,199k and going strong,5,"I bought this Mariner used with high mileage (150K) because I paid 10k less than any other Mariner or Escape in the area that was listed. It's been an absolutely fantastic vehicle. My wife and I have put another 50k on her since we bought it with multiple 8 hour+ drives (both across the country and up and down the east coast). She's never, ever let us down. Beyond basic maintenance (brakes, oil changes, tires) we haven't had to do anything. The gas mileage is fantastic considering it's an AWD V6 as well. Average 22.3 with ~24 on the highway and 18 in town. In the snow it's great, the AWD works as it should, and I've never felt like I'm losing control. If we need to haul anything we can put the back seats down and have acres of space. As for comfort, it's delightful. The leather heated seats keep you warm in the winter and are easy to clean and maintain, the A/C always blows cold, and the power windows and moonroof are great features. Overall, I would buy another one tomorrow without hesitation. I know there are some that have had issues, but ours is a true gem.
"
mercury,mariner,2008,CMB, 01/08/2010,Surprises Ford won't tell you about,4,"I love my 2008 Mariner.  But be warned, in 2008 they changed a design that sends the transmission fluid through the A/C condenser.  Why? Not really sure, but if you think you are leaking oil, it may be transmission fluid and it may be coming from the condenser.  This leak will drain your transmission in about 3 days.  Call Ford, they will have this $450 part in stock as they are replacing them weekly.  But, they will not admit there is a problem.  Yes, there is a TSB on this issue starting with 2008's.  Again, based on my ratings, I do love this truck.  As for the loud tire noise, trust me its the original tires.  I put new tires on and now I enjoy  my hour and half drive to and from work. "
mercury,mariner,2008,skmcobra, 08/21/2014,Not too bad after 128k miles,4,"My wife bought this car in 2010 with 81k miles.
She bought the extended warranty but I believe only needed it at around 115k miles for an oil pan leak.
Today at 128k miles the radiator coolant fans have quit running.
Ford dealer quoted me $750 parts & labor but I had done my research and found fans for $100 less at O'Reillys.
They honored the price and dropped cost to $650.
Getting it fixed today.
Over all this has been a reliable and safe car.
Great to drive in the snow with the all wheel drive.
Gets about 22-24mpg on the highway and about 17-18 in town.
I can't speak to the tranny issues many mention, but it may have been fixed before we bought it.

UPDATE:  Sold the car in spring 2016 with approximately 146k miles.  Was still running good but the transmission would make a hard knock every now and then.  We decided to sell it in case the transmission went out.  We told the buyer and they were ok with it for the price at $5,800.

mercury,mariner,2008,speedlump2, 07/22/2011,Bad Transmission,2,"I bought a brand new 2008 Mercury Mariner from Malloy Auto Mall in Woodbridge, VA.
In 2009 the transmission starting skipping gears.
Took it to the shop, it was fixed under warranty.
2010 took it back to the shop for the transmission again.
Not covered by warranty.
Cost over $800 to fix.
Jump forward to 2011, took it back to the shop, for what you ask?
The transmission again. This $2235 to fix it.
Ford refuses to do anything about it.
DO NOT BUY THIS VEHICLE.
I wish I would have read other reviews before I purchased.
I will never buy another for vehicle.
Don't take my word.
Read other reviews and see the same problem I have."
mercury,mariner,2008,Molly Mc, 03/15/2009,very safe!,3,"although the gas mileage could be improved and the transmission slipping could use improvement too,i cannot say enough about how great the safety features on this car are. I was recently hit from behind by a drag racing honda going in excess of 65 mph. both side curtain air bags deployed, side impact airbags,seatbelts worked fantastic and although my Mariners floor buckled and roof creased in two places and is probably a total loss,i walked away from this accident with a little whip lash.  This car took hit fantastically."
mercury,mariner,2008,lb330011, 03/21/2013,Transmission!!,1,I had to participate in the recall on the transmission a couple years ago after having my car less than a year. Today I go to start it and the transmission is completely out! Never again will I buy a Ford. The customer service is horrible and of course the new transmission issue has nothing to do with them. 
mercury,mariner,2008,DMS, 04/18/2009,Glad I went with the Mercury,4,"I have had my vehicle since November of 2008.  Initially I was interested in the Ford Escape, but I realized I liked the style of the Mercury Mariner better.  I really have no complaints so far.  The gas mileage is about 20 MPG.  I had some concerns about not being able to engage the 4 wheel drive manually, but it was great for me this winter and I had no problems in the snow.  I would recommend this vehicle to anyone wanting a small SUV.  "
mercury,mariner,2008,tigger66, 04/17/2011,Lovin My New Ride !!!!,4,"I purchased my '08 Mariner after my ""00 Tacoma was recalled due to a safety issue. I love the blue dash panel,the 6 disc CD changer and the MP3 port.The climate controls and the sound system controls are nicely located and easy to use. The console shift makes it look sporty which I love.The center console is roomy and has a removable tray that can be used elsewhere in the vehicle. The seats are very comfortable which was a concern of mine. My only issue is the silver painted plastic which is used on the console and on the door panels...They scuff and look old and cheap.I did buy my vehicle pre-owned so I didn't expect perfection however for a three year old vehicle,this shouldnt be an issue."
mercury,mariner,2008,Nick , 03/18/2007,Best Little SUV On The Market !!!!!!,5,Recently i purchased a 2008 Mercury Mariner and i have to say i could not be happier with it this is my second Mariner the first one was a 2005 and i loved it so much i just had to have the redesigned model. First of all the ride is 100 percent improve over the old model it is quiet and smooth and it handles much better and the navigation system is very easy to use and gives precise directions and the Sirius radio is great and you can put just about anything in that DEEP center console. And i am 6'3 FT and i have plenty of head and legroom but the rear legroom can be tight and the quality of the interior is improved over the old model as well. I really recommend the  Mercury Mariner to all.

transmisson cooler leak, which was fixed, but now my transmission is out, i have 65,000 miles on my vechicle and had to buy a new transmisson, i was wondering if anyone else had this problem or did i just get the lemon. i havent had any other problems until i noticed the leak, got it fixed immedately then a month later my transmisson started slipping, couldnt believe it, i will never by another FORD again, apparently they dont take pride in their vehicles otherwise why just the 60,000 mile warranty instead of 100,000 like the other competetors.
if anyone else has had this problem please let me know, thanks"
mercury,mariner,2008,shihchi, 06/23/2013,"Excellent after 100,000 miles",5,"Bought my Mariner new in June 2008, trading in an '02 Escape w/ 150,000 miles on it. Now at 100,000 miles, the Mariner has had no problems. Avg. 26-29 mpg. ""Hassle"" of folding down back seats is nonexistent: requires 30 seconds. No big deal. Replaced noisy OEM Continental tires with Goodyear Assurance tires, and little, if any, road noise can be heard. Like the leather seats and moonroof. 1st gen. 4-cylinder, 4-spd auto trans. work well; I don't miss additional cubes or gears. Pop-open rear window very handy. Upscale ambience nice. Never experienced trans.-coolant leakage; recalled before any problems experienced. Seats very comfortable for all-day drives between Dallas and St. Louis."

Love this vehicle.  I am able to get a solid 26 MPG on highway trips. And that's doing 75 mph when able. My dealer didn't believe it so I sent him a picture text when I reached it.  Can't make that number up. Hope he uses it for future customers.  No problems with comfort, reliability, safety, and the commercial that came out with the husband and wife fighting over the Mariner was exactly what my husband I do on a constant basis. I think he loves it even more than I do.   "

The sad part is it has been at the Ford dealer 3 weeks today because they don't have a replacement part. Today I was told they aren't sure when the part will come in.  Keep your eyes open if you own one, because it sounds like a common problem with this vehicle."

mercury,mariner,2008,LD, 02/13/2018,I am loving it!,4,"I just got this car a few weeks ago after having an accident in my Pacifica.  I pulled upon the lot and this one, an Equinox and a Saturn Outlook caught my eye, all sitting on the front line.  Now, keep in mind I have never been able to ""shop"" on the front line.  I was reassured by the dealership that I could get into anything on the lot.  I asked him about the Equinox and the Saturn and both faired compaired to the Mercury Mariner.  It was shorter than I expected but I loved the look.  To me it could hold up to the more well known SUV of this size.  Mine is white and the first thing that caught my eye.  It just looked good.  I do a walk around and I love the size of the tires.  I get in and the interior is great for a 2008 with about 107K miles.  It has power everything except the passenger side seat and the tailgate.  I can't put my foot under the back like the Ford Escape (the Mariner is a Ford product and the Escape's counter part).  Ok.  No problem.  I turn the car on and take for a ride.  Honestly, it tickled me the  way the instrument panel lite up.  The ride was smooth and quiet and the radio system is pretty good as well.  There is a sunroof that, unfortunately had me a little confused.  Went through the car wash and water was lightly sprinkling in.  It's a great car for the money and fits my family of 4.

mercury,mariner,2008,Fred, 06/16/2008,What a Great Vehicle,5,When I went to purchase this vehicle I wanted everything on it and I got it. I love almost everything about it.  I like that is looks way more expensive than what it actually cost. Its classy. the interior is great too. I have plenty of room to take my friends/family along. I feel very safe when driving this vehicle.

Had some faulty paint issue on the metal strip between front/ back door window. Problem taken care and all seems to be good. Built in handles on back hatch are very nice but not practical for a shorter person. Could use a pull strap. Overall it is a nice car
mercury,mariner,2008,Garey, 09/24/2008,Great Small Luxury SUV,4,"I actually got misty-eyed trading in my Mariner last week for a less expensive, sub-compact. My Mariner was loaded with amenities, including european leather-seat design which drew tons of compliments, premium sound system and navigation.  The vehicle was comfortable and very pleasant to drive in the city or on the highway (20.5/27.5 mpg). Never had any trouble with it for the 28,000 miles I put on it. The 9-speaker/6 CD premium sound was worth every penny extra. I cannot say enough about how well this car was designed and made. I am looking forward to better economic times when I can trade in my new sub-compact for another Mariner."
mercury,mariner,2008,Jmbcoco, 10/25/2009,Love it so far,5,Bought a new leftover 2008 Mariner Premier with all the toys. Traded in a Explorer Sport Trac (V-8).

Test drove first thing in the morning after 2"" sleet & Ice storm. We went to a parking lot drive with a 10% uphill grade, stopped and accelerated with no wheel slip, turned around came back down. Traction control, ABS & stability controls are great. This is not our first 4WD but this one impresses me. Mariner is appointed much better than Escape in my opinion and with identicle drive trains more bang for the buck is always better. Ice Blue exterior W/satin grill looks and blends well together. Enough said; Go out and get one. "

I previously owned 4 Mazda products and wanted a Tribute but dealer could not locate a Grand Touring V6 in 3 states. I now feel the Mercury (based on Tribute) is the better choice. More features and more upscale look. I'm very pleased.
mercury,mariner,2008,SC, 06/19/2007,"So far, So good...",5,"While I've only owned this car for about one month, I've already hit my first 1000 and love it.  It's not a V- 6, but the ride power doesn't feel much different than my previous suv, which was 6 cylinder.  So far, this purchase has been well worth it.  I've gotten several compliments on the look of this vehicle and my friends who have ridden in it compliment on the smoothness of the ride.  "

mercury,mariner,2008,missmgmnt, 01/07/2012,Very Poor Gas Mileage,3,"I traded my 2006 Kia Sorento in for the 2008 Mariner this past July. The Mariner was very stylish and offered newer accessories like heated seats and the back up warning system. Initially when I filled my tank up the mileage meter would read ""320 miles to empty"". But since my first oil change at the dealer this figure has steadily decreased to the point where today it read ""227 miles to empty"". How on earth could the fuel efficiency drop from 320 to 227 miles like that???? When I fill the tank I generally add between 11-12 gallons so that isn't the issue. VERY disappointed! With the high cost of gas today, such poor fuel economy is just unacceptable. Wish I could get my Kia back! :-("
mercury,mariner,2008,kingsime1, 02/18/2014,Burned!!!,1,"I have bought and paid for a 2008 Mercury Mariner, and on the day I made that last payment...my 2008 Mercury Mariner literally started to fall apart!
From the ""torque converter"" to the cigarette lighter...you name it, and there's a problem...of which I see thousands of complaints online, yet no recalls, or any attempts by your company to right these wrongs your company has done by knowingly selling faulty products, and doing absolutely nothing about repairing these problems after you've taken the money!
I swear, I will NEVER purchase an american product (not only cars, but anything with ""made in U.S.A."" on it) in my life.
It's no wonder the american car companies folded to the foreigners!"
mercury,mariner,2008,Chelly, 05/26/2009,Stay Away,1,"I bought the 2008 Mercury Mariner in March 2007. I have had nothing but problems with this vehicle.  During the first 12 months, the car would stall without any warning and when I brought it into the dealer, they told me nothing was wrong with it. I had to bring it in an additional two times before they fixed it correctly.  Recently, I was driving on Interstate 80 going about 65 when the car completely stalled again without warning and reduced in speed rapidly.   This car is not reliable. I will never buy a Mercury, Lincoln or Ford ever again. Stay away from this one. "
mercury,mariner,2008,ramona, 06/24/2009,Lovin it!,4,"I have owned my vehicle a week now and am really enjoying it.  After researching several cars thoroughly for price, amenities, style, crash tests, reliability, and fuel economy, I settled on the Mariner.  I am surprised at how many men actually like it because it is a pretty metallic green color.  It is really quite sharp, with its black trim and slate interior.  We love our sunroof and find it functional in Florida to let the heat out.  The upolstery is the best--wipes clean easily and is very comfortable----the seats are cushy and the ride smooth and solid.  I never wanted to touch a vehicle with dark interior, but this is remarkably cool and comfortable.  We find our Mariner very roomy."
mercury,mariner,2008,jesse, 09/10/2007,Almost great but disappointing,4,"Very nice fit and finish as well as peppy. Engine feels fine and steering is very good. The only problem is with the transmission. It is the worst trans I have every had in a car. It shifts when it shouldn't and doesn't shift when it should. Service told me that the problems I have explained to them are normal for the car. Other than the trans, I would rate the car a ten but because of such a flaw in a major component I would give it a 7 overall."
mercury,mariner,2008,NewMercuryowner, 12/12/2008,Love this small SUV,4,"I traded in my huge Yukon for this Mariner. The gas prices were killing us, so we did our research. I love how much easier this is to drive! My case is different though, after paying one note on it, got rear ended and was nearly totaled."
mercury,mariner,2008,Country, 04/25/2008,Don't Plan On Hanging Up Your Clothes !!,4,"Mercury has not designed the mariner for folks who like to travel. Too much daytime glare on the instrument panels and poor lighting contrast will leave you squinting to see the temperatures and your fuel economy indicators. Mercury's engineers left out all the interior entry & exit assist handles that made our mountaineer a delight to use. They claim it's the side curtain airbags, but sit in a side air bag equipped, top of the line Lincoln and you'll see plenty of handles to hang a clothes travel rod on. One stinking little pull out hook that will only hold 5 shirt hangers doesn't cut it !"
mercury,mariner,2008,Georgr, 03/16/2009,Model A Ford,1,The model A ford was a more comfortable riding car than my Mercury Marinar. Its rough riding and and very noisy. The seat are like setting on lava rock. poor gas mileage 10 to 17 miles per gal.It is a very difacult car for Disabled people to get in and out off. Now power going up a Steap hill. I would trade it in a minute if i could afford to. The model A had the Mercury Mariner bet by 100 to 1
mercury,mariner,2008,Joe, 07/22/2008,4 cyl Mariner runs great,4,"Took delivery in March. In mostly suburban driving we are getting 22.5 mpg. Highway 27 mpg. This in northern New Jersey with AWD. 7500 miles so far and no issues. You have to push the car to get it to perform at times. But I expect that with only 153 hp. Cruises at 85-90 no problem at all. We have the convenience package which is the not loaded version. But includes 6 cd, sunroof etc. nicley packaged."
mercury,mariner,2008,T-Man, 07/24/2008,Great Work Car!,4,"I traded in a Lincoln Mark LT for my Mercury Mariner to get better gas mileage to and from work. For a small SUV, I am impressed with the room and amenities provided. Stepping down to the Mercury, I still opted for leather, moon roof, and six disk CD."
mercury,mariner,2008,pop123, 12/18/2007,"Nice, Comfortable Mariner",4,"I like my new Mariner, but i already found improvements that need to be made, i love the ice blue lighting, the premier model, the exterior design, the radio and HVAC control design. the engine i think is underpowered, and the transmission needs some work, i had to tramp it to the floor 3 or 4 times to finally get it to down shift around like 25-30 MPH. The premier model, go for it. And 4WD go for it too! Unfortunately I didn't get the 4WD, which is a huge mistake, it isn't that well in the snow."
mercury,mariner,2008,smt921, 08/22/2008,Another great vehicle!,4,This is my second Mariner and I could not be happier. I previously had a 2005. The slight changes made to this model have been well appreciated. Love that the base price came down as well.
mercury,mariner,2008,MercuryMan, 09/10/2008,MercuryMan,4,"Wow! I bought this little SUV for my wife's daily driver, and I love the thing. She can't keep me out of this thing. It gets 29mpg highway and 22+ in city driving. I never travel with a hang up bag so I didn't even notice the lack of hangers in the rear. The seats are firm and comfortable. My wife opted for the Redfire exterior and stone cloth interior. I about gagged when she said tht was her preference. We owned a Mitsubushi Montero that I also liked and prior to that we owned a Toyota 4 Runner, both were excellent vehicles but the love was not there. By the way my spouse loves her Mariner as well. She just has a hard time getting behind the wheel of this great little SUV."
mercury,mariner,2008,MP, 10/13/2008,"Great mileage, sporty, roomy",5,"I love this car! I haven't been excited about a car in a long time, and this one makes me very happy.  I can get 32mph hwy and 26-28 city!  My husband is just under 7ft tall and can drive and sit in the car very comfortably. When he is in the driver's seat, the back seat behind him still has plenty of leg room. Drives great on the highway and I've put a lot of highway miles on it. My son has already put his claim to the car when he gets his license. Super cargo room. Sporty, fun and very economical to drive. They've missed a bet not promoting this vehicle more aggressively."
mercury,mariner,2008,James, 10/30/2008,Outstanding,5,"I bought my Mariner with 5mi on the odometer.  Drove it off the lot and was very impressed with the power that the I4 motor has. I used to drive a 4cyl Honda CR-V and it didn't have the power my Mariner has. For the price I paid, the amenities you get (i.e. leather steering wheel, 6-disc changer, etc...) are well worth the purchase."
mercury,mariner,2008,brooke, 12/22/2008,My favorite car ever!,4,"I cannot say enough about this car. I have had it for about 13 months and absolutely love it. I get compliments all the time about its looks. It has power, it goes great in the snow, and it looks great. I have the silver exterior with the black leather interior, sun/moonroof, 6 cd changer, power everything. Love this vehicle! "
mercury,mariner,2008,mko, 12/30/2008,"Love the car, but I'm averaging 19 MPG",3,"I drive the car on the weekends in the city, and on the highway. Took a very long road trip from Chicago to Santa Fe in August. Love the car, but I don't know how these other people are getting mid to high 20's for gas mileage. I'm consistently getting 18- 20. "
mercury,mariner,2008,owensry, 01/27/2009,Good Car,4,"The Mariner runs well except the transmission pump went out and leaked all over my driveway, and it was slipping bad, the transmission was very rough when I drove it off the lot. Anyway, not very good. Overall it is a nice car."
mercury,mariner,2008,Love my Mariner!, 09/24/2009,Great SUV,4,"I've owned my Mariner for about 5 weeks now and couldn't be happier. It may be a smaller SUV on the outside, but it doesn't feel small while driving it and the interior is rather large and accomodating. The gas mileage, in my opinion is excellent for an SUV of any size.  I came from a 2007 Grand Cherokee Limited with a V8 engine and assumed I would have some trouble getting used to the size and power of the Mariner, but that wasn't the case at all. The back seat is actually bigger than the Jeep's and overall, it feels like it is the same size. I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend the Mariner. "
mercury,mariner,2008,padriver, 02/14/2008,Considering a second one,4,"Got my Mariner in November 2007 to replace my old Explorer. Was a little nervous about getting a smaller SUV as I am 6'00 and 200+ but wanted better gas mileage. Great move. The Mariner thus far has been fantastic. (3000 + miles in)Comfortable, fun to drive and I'm getting 20 mpg which I consider great as I tend to fly on the interstate. My wife recently drove this for a few days due to bad weather and now we are seriously considering getting another one for her. She never had an SUV and didn't think she would like one but I had to wrestle the keys off her to get my vehicle back! Mercury did this one right! Also there are less Mariners out there than Escapes so it still looks more unique."
mercury,mariner,2008,Phil from Cleveland, 04/06/2007,Much Improved,5,"I leased a 2005 Mercury Mariner and enjoyed the SUV, however it had some shortfalls. Well, after taking delivery of a 2008 Mariner recently, they fixed everything! It is quiet, responsive and the fit and finish is what you expect in a car. This vehicle is as good as any manufacturer's product, no matter where it is made. Mercury has a winner in this SUV. If they make all their cars like this good things are in the future for the company."
mercury,mariner,2008,Tyler, 03/27/2007,08 Mariner Premier,5,My new 08 Mercury Mariner is an awesome SUV it has a smooth ride it handles great has plenty of cargo space and to be just a 3.0L V6 it has plenty of get up and go and it runs very quiet and the transmission shifts very smooth and the Exterior looks great i love the design and style and the fit and finish is very good inside and out and to be as small as it is it has plenty of space for you to get comfortable and i love the way all the radio and climate controls are made and i like the display screen at the top of the dash above the a/c vents the interior design looks great i love everything about this SUV i couldn't be happier i really think you should check the Mariner out cause its awesome
mercury,mariner,2008,Maureen, 04/28/2007,Traded up to an American SUV!,5,"I love the luxurious ride in my 2008 Mariner. The ride is smooth! Lots of nice features for the price, leather seats, dual temperature controls. "
mercury,mariner,2008,Joe, 08/02/2007,Extremely Pleased So Far!,4,"First SUV and thought I would give Ford/Mercury a shot. Extremely pleased after 6 weeks with this vehicle. Not sure of the reliability, so I bought the extended warranty. Hopefully it's what it appears to be and I'll have made a good choice."
mercury,mariner,2008,Mark Robison, 09/09/2007,Many Improvements - '08 Best One Yet!,5,"Had an '06 Escape, but the '08 made such great improvements. The Mariner offers more deluxe features over the Escape. Cup holders are a major improvement, as is the ice blue dash lights and the dash-top center display. Exterior appearance looks tough, yet elegant, and the ride is finally smooth and comfortable. Passengers compliment the feel of the rear seats and from the front, it feels roomier and slightly ""bigger."""
mercury,mariner,2008,terih2os, 09/19/2007,New Mariner,4,I am impressed with the manueverability. Only downside I see currently is the noise from the auto fan cutting on. Perhaps I need to learn to control this better. Having difficulty discovering this easily if it is present.
mercury,mariner,2008,MH from Dallas, 06/22/2007,Full Tilt Evaluation,5,"I got the Mariner based on its larger appearing exterior and sharp looks. I am very impressed with the options on my Premier. Leather, rear spoiler, Sirius Radio, running boards, the wood interior trim. I was (and am) traveling from Dallas to Tulsa weekly and the roads vary in quality. I found immediately that the SUV was very comfortable, and I'm averaging 22 MPG over just less than 4000 miles now.  It is surpassing my expectations in all respects. No defects, no rattles, no hassles and tight steering.  Mercury made a good one for 2008 and I heartily recommend it to anyone who likes the economy and doesn't have a need for a huge SUV.  "
mercury,mariner,2008,Ann, 07/23/2007,It's great,4,"I had a 2001 Tribute that I got rid of in 2006 when I purchased a V6 RAV4. I was never really happy with the RAV4, it just didn't have the things on my Tribute that I liked so I went back and found the Mariner and love it. It's like coming home. I will admit it does not have the pick up that the RAVhad even though I have a V6 currently. But besides that it got lots of room and comfortable seats. We just drove 8 hours in one day for a vacation and had no problems with our backs."
mercury,mariner,2008,Tim, 08/07/2007,A Great Little SUV for the Money,4,"Before leasing my new Mariner I compared it with other vehicles such as the new Hyundai Santa Fe and the new Mitsubishi Outlander. The Santa Fe was marvelous, with two faults: 1) Lack of available Nav. and 2) Poor leasing rate percentages (7.9% for a person with stellar credit? Are you kidding me?) The Outlander had all of the bells and whistles, but I just wasn't thrilled with the way its rear-end looked... too much like a hatch-back car from the rear. The re-designed Mariner is very ""classy"" looking (especially in Gloss Black) and Mercury was offering something like 1.9% leasing. Interest savings alone compared to the actually cheaper Santa Fe was over $120/month just in saved interest."
mercury,mariner,2008,Steve, 09/04/2007,Great Buy!,4,"First off, Mercury has hit the jackpot!  I drove the '07 Toyota Rav 4 and for a 6' tall guy, very uncomfortable!  (Plus, not very manly!)  The Mariner is just a great SUV that gets pretty good gas mileage. I've averaged 27 hwy and 24 city. The construction is great too!  All car manufacturers are going with a lot of plastic and we all know it.  But the interior is very nicely put together.  Try the Rav 4 first and then drive the Mariner...  you'll see the difference!"
mercury,mariner,2008,EMMA, 05/23/2007,"Left Volvo v70XC, AWD for this Mariner",4,"So far, so good. Hopefully the gas mileage of all cars will improve in the next 39 months. Went for the basic model this time. Not bad at all. Like the height and handling and new safety features. 360 visability is awesome. Great tailgate options of opening the window or the whole back...rear wiper too! Quiet, smooth ride. Love the Moon and Tune package, sunroof and Sirius radio. Senior parents found it a bit tough to get into, but they made it. Center console is well designed and there are plenty of cupholders. Great in the rain, let's see about the snow."
mercury,mariner,2008,David G. Maroon, 08/18/2007,Great Midsize SUV,4,"The Mariner Premier V6 AWD midsize SUV is loaded with features including 6 way power seat, 17"" aluminum wheels, 4 disc brakes, rear park assist, leather heated seats and dual climate control.  Drivers seat (Lumbar) is very comfortable, excellent ride, quiet, superb radio/7-speaker system. We also own a 2007 Lexus RX 350 and enjoy the Mariner's features as much.  "
mercury,mariner,2008,Happy, 09/19/2007,Happy,5,I love my Mariner! I think it drives very smooth and takes turns like a champ! I love everything about my car! I feel safe and that was a number one concern I had when shopping for a car! So if you are thinking about getting one do it!
mercury,mariner,2008,Bob, 10/13/2007,Highly Impressed,5,"Have a little over 700 miles and getting almost 22 MPG with A/C on. V-6 extremely quiet, has plenty of power. Interior is so quiet. Night and day diffeernce over 2005 Hyundai Santa FE, which was a piece of junk. "
mercury,mariner,2008,RayRay, 10/18/2007,It's the one for me,4,Just bought this SUV and for the price I got my moneys worth. 4WD and all. Just wish it had a DVD player and drop down screen in the back I like to watch DVDs while I wait for my coffee at Dunkin D.
mercury,mariner,2008,Donna, 11/13/2007,Very Nice Small SUV,4,"Our first SUV. Drove Toyota Camry XLE's for past 10 years. The Mariner is missing some of those amenities, but overall, very nice. Very happy with Mariner's interior cargo room and front seat area design and features such as dual heat and air controls and seat warmers. Not so thrilled with gas mileage so far. Have 3500 miles and only averaging 19 in traffic and 22 on highway. Hoping for better as mileage increases.  Exterior look is great...many compliments on that."
mercury,mariner,2008,Gregg, 11/18/2007,Best Value for a Small SUV,4,"When I decided to buy my first SUV, I decided to go small.  I researched all of the SUVs in the class and decided on going with either the Mariner or Escape.  I ultimately decided on the Mariner Premier 4WD. The re-designed Mariner is the best looking inside and out of all of the SUVs in the class.  It is both bold, but yet has a sophisicated look. In my opinion it beats the Escape in looks. The interior is simple, functional and classy despite the heavy use of plastics on the doors.  Against all of the other SUVs in the class, it's the best value in terms of standard features and available options. Lastly, the fit and finish is superb."
mercury,mariner,2008,Donna, 12/02/2007,In love with my Mariner,4,"I did quite a bit of research before I made my purchase. It was between the Chevy Equinox and the Mariner.  I found the Mariner a better buy for the dollar. It is such a quiet and smooth ride and I love the front wheel drive. My favorite thing is the ice blue display and the display at the top center of the dash. It's very comfortable to drive. I have dogs that go with me often, so the back seats folding completely flat was very important to me. My dissapointments are few. The plastic front grille, only one hanger hook in the entire vehicle and plastic covers over my wheels and last, only a four speed transmission."
mercury,mariner,2008,Tom, 03/15/2008,I Love my Mariner,5,I traded a Chevy S-10 pickup. I love the features of the Moon and Tune package. The V6 has plenty of power and for two weeks the average gas mileage is 22mpg with mixed driving.  The price/value is among the best values on the market. This is my first SUV and my wife likes driving it.
mercury,mariner,2008,marshismellow, 03/24/2008,2008 Mariner Premier FWD,4,"Let me start off by saying that I have never owned an SUV.  Let me also say that my two previous automobiles were a Mercedes C240 and a BMW 325i. I have been incredibly pleased with my Mariner since purchasing it. I love the styling, I have all of the same options that I had in my luxury sedans (heated seats, moon roof, CD players, power everything). I actually have a few more options on my Mariner Premier that I didn't have on the luxury sedans (heated mirrors). The Mariner is fun to drive and extrememly roomy inside. It feels big but is actually shorter in lenght and width than my Mercedes was.  I researched the hybrids, but for the lease rate I received I couldn't pass this up. I wouldn't have ever thought I'd own a Mercury, but it's elegant, stylish, and a better value. "
mercury,mariner,2008,Chris, 05/24/2008,Awesome Vehicle!,4,"I absolutely love the new Mariner. Rides great. I4 is kind of loud, but it's okay. Huge moonroof! Ride quality is great. Great looking, awesome stereo. Excellent price for what you get."

mercury,mariner,2008,hlewis77, 07/30/2019,Ok but not great,3,"I bought my 2008 Mercury Mariner brand new.  The transmission went out in 2010 and I fought with Ford until they fixed it.  I have 135k miles on it now and the transmission is out again.  On a side note, the moon roof broke the month after I bought it and it hasn't worked since.  Also, the seats are ""recycled"" material and they always look dirty.  I spilled some water on one that never get sat on and it looks like I dumped a coke on it.  I'm not hard on my cars and I take care of them.  I've never had a transmission go out twice and I'm sure that it will again, if I keep it for any longer.  Really wish I had read reviews before I bought it."
mercury,mariner,2009,VIC, 09/23/2010,Transmission problems,3,"We bought this car in august 2009. We have taken it to the dealer in 3 different occasions for transmission problems. The first time they said they had to reprogram the computer. The second time they said they had a recall and they had to reprogram the computer again. This week we took it in again and they said they can fix the problem since they cannot reproduce the problem while testing it. This is the worst car we ever owned. The rpm jump to 6000 in the highway, the car basically stops working and you have to get out of the highway to avoid an accident. This happens randomly.  Once you stop and restart the car it runs without problems.  This dealer has not help us in solving the problem."

She has a name..Bessie or Dragonfly,5,"I've had this car since 2009 when it made me buy it from across the parking lot while at a restaurant! This car has held up to hauling artwork, art supplies, camping gear, hauling college student things, dogs, building materials, oh and many people too! It is durable and has outlasted many other friends' vehicles by far. Low maintenance car and has dealt w/ many unusual weather issues w/ ease. The back seats fold down to give you space for whatever you need to haul and is split/flexible too for those times when you need three seats and hauling things. Whenever she goes in for a trade, it would be a great first car for anyone.
Just went on a major road adventure for family wedding out of state. Had to haul medical items for my father this time and it included a walker, wheelchair, their luggage, mine/daughters, bags up the wazoo let alone the coat bags/robe for the wedding (dad's a minister). It was packed but the storage again in the back was amazing yet was able to see fine to drive and everyone in comfort. As we arrived, we went through a torrential downpour and heavy traffic in a metro area, the car handled like a pro and kept us safe when others were hydroplaning. Thankful for this car.

mercury,mariner,2009,Bill, 08/21/2008,Mariner Premier V6 FWD VOGA Edition,5,"New engine and transmission deliver smooth performance with more than adequate power.  White suede paint looks good.  The black and cashmere interior is very sharp, and the stylish look has garnered many positive comments particularly from women. Controls and displays are well laid out and easy to use / monitor without diverting attention from the road.  Getting almost 20 MPG in 65% city / 35% freeway driving in the Austin heat with the AC on. Steering gives the car a very light feel but is accurate. AC very powerful for front passengers on hot days even set at 78 degrees with fan on a low setting. Very little sun glare on dashboard or center displays."
mercury,mariner,2009,Ken, 01/28/2016,Transmission. Seems to be the common denominator,3,"Our car has been garage kept, low mileage, driven smoothly.
Transmission has been a nightmare. Has been to the dealership 8 times for exact same transmission issue without long term repair. They simply reset the computer. So it's obviously a software problem. They deny there is a recall or even a service bulletin regarding same, even though I have found proof otherwise. 
Now that it's out of warranty,  they want to charge $175.00 each time they ""reprogram "" the computer. As it turns out, a FORMER service tech explained that this involves disconnecting the battery for 30 mins. That's it! 

Our dealer will not stand by any one these so called 'repairs', and that's the real issue. No real repair, no long term fix, no support or warranty on service.

Next vehicle model  will be more thoroughly researched with long history of good service ratings, likely a Subaru.

UPDATE: 8-16 car remains in our possession,  but sadly we can't trust it for longer trips, so it stays in the garage.

mercury,mariner,2009,Freddo, 11/11/2009,Many problems...,2,"I was excited when I bought this car.  Unfortunately, it has proven to be dangerously unreliable.  1.  Tire pressure warning kept going off for no reason. 2.  GPS lost signal and also couldn't find its way to Oakland airport. 3. Transmission started jerking and failing.  We reported the transmission problem and brought the car in to the dealer.  They told us there was apparently no problem even though AAA was called at one point because the car wouldn't start.  When put into Neutral, it started.  This morning I had to run out to the highway and pick up my wife because the transmission was making weird noises and the car was lurching forward.  Total transmission failure."

My wife leased a Mariner recently and is in love with it.  I rather liked it more than I thought I would, and found few vehicles that were as functional, comfortable, and well priced as the Merc.  Also the 0% financing was a strong motivator.  Its surprisingly good, and I don't miss the Japanese competitors. I am hoping to say that in years to come.  Go Ford."
mercury,mariner,2009,Travis, 12/18/2009,Bad Transmission,4,Bought brand new this March.  Noticed a little slip or gear miss when the car would shift into 2nd gear. Took to dealer and had a solenoid replaced in October. This took 7 days to repair. Two weeks later all noticed it was slipping now in all six gears. Took car back yesterday and found out that they now need need to replace the transmission because the piece they need to replace is not sold individually.Now they have it and will take another week to get the transmission in and who knows how long that will take. GOD love Ford transmissions.  They should stop making those new 6 speed transmission.

NOTHING. My eight month old Mariner began losing transmission fluid at 8800 miles. I took in in to the dealer and a WEEK later they tell me that they are waiting for a replacement axle. This is a recurring problem for the Ford and Merc Escape/Mariner which is leading to a shortage of parts. Service Manager told me he has two vehicles waiting for that axle. This is the last Ford product for me."
mercury,mariner,2009,nikki626, 02/01/2012,Nice Looking Car; lacks comfortable driving,2,This car is really built nicely and it looks pretty but the drive is very forgettable. Cannot get Sync to work... will be trading in for something else. 
mercury,mariner,2009,Russ Page, 01/24/2019,Great SUV,5,"Despite Edmunds concern about rear brakes, never had problems with them. Car got regular maintenance at dealer. Dealer service great, whether Mercury or when Mercury went away, Ford. Folding rear seats may have been a pain, but no worse than any van I ever owned. Sync electronics in 2009 far superior to electronics in later models(such as an Escape). Hands-free phone better than equivalent in 2011 Toyota Avalon. Won't allow distracting operation such as texting, directory look up when vehicle moving in excess of 3mph.

mercury,mariner,2009,desert7rain, 04/26/2012,Continuous transmission issues...company refuses to fix.,2,"My mom has a 2009 Chrysler Mariner and from the beginning it has had transmission issues.
Shifting rough, jerking into gear and lagging between gears then rough shift.
 They have have had it in the Chrysler shop at least 8 times and it has never been fixed. Even with it obviously not shifting right they would tell us that they could find nothing wrong. When we are able to get a diagnosis, it will be fixed for a week and then it's back to mal-functioning.
Now they are completely refusing to pay for any further repairs.
This car is not worth the money simply because the company does not believe in fixing issues and it has been in the shop so much that it is difficult on day to day life. "
mercury,mariner,2009,LaddDez, 10/20/2008,"Love it, and so does my wife!",4,"I did a lot of research including Edmunds before buying. Was looking for the hybrid, but decided on the 4 cyl. premier version. The price difference will never be made up in gas cost. Ride is excellent, quality great, and I like the new low roll resistant Michelin tires this year. And I got a good deal in addition to the $1500 rebate. Great comfortable replacement for our Town and Country with plenty of storage space, and the back seats fold absolutely flat. Great for the dog! Buy this car and you will not be sorry.  "
mercury,mariner,2009,B. doyle, 11/13/2008,"Fun Driver, Sync is great, reliability?",3,"Fun vehicle to drive, great gas mileage gets 27.9 mpg highway on trips. 4 cylinder runs rough at idle due apparently to trying to maximize fuel mileage, the hood even shakes. Also had computer controlling the transmission break causing the car to downshift 2 gears on the highway, scary. Brought it to the dealer and was fixed the same day, had to reset the computer.(Dealer says it's a common problem with '09's) The car now has 6,000 miles on it and I truly enjoy it but be careful. At high speeds the vehicle feels like it is going to tip over. "
mercury,mariner,2009,Not Pleased, 01/04/2009,Drive a lot before buying,2,"This is my fourth Ford/Mercury I have owned and also the worst. The gas mileage is fine and was the reason I downsized from an Explorer. But the noise level inside this car is awful. My 10 year old Explorer was a quieter ride than this vehicle. The roads I tested it on near the dealership must have been very smooth.  I will never buy another car without going over all types of roads, including bad ones. Please turn every knob to maximum level before buying. Turning heat/AC to anything above the lowest level is very noisy. The dealership says it is normal tire noise when I complain about the noise inside the vehicle. The radio has to be turned up loud to hear over the outside noise.  "
mercury,mariner,2009,gators, 02/02/2009,Great SUV,5,"Overall this is a great SUV.  We test drove almost every small SUV on the market including RAV, CRV, Vue, Rogue, Outlook, etc. We liked how this one looked and handled the best. Smooth, quiet and one of the best set of features available in its class. Excellent safety ratings and very good gas mileage for its class as well. Have had for 1 month and am very pleased."
mercury,mariner,2009,NJ Mitch, 03/27/2009,Where does the Gas Go??,4,"I just purchased my '09 coming out of a '07 Mariner. Both trucks are night and day. I have a fully loaded Mariner ,some days I do not want to stop driving. Only issue is fuel economy. I am getting close to 270 miles per tank and that is with 75% hwy driving. I am hoping this is the break in period and will improve. This is the best bang for your buck in SUV class. Kudos to Ford for making such drastic improvements and driver friendly features. Oh did I mention the Sync package with Nav, oh it is one of the best I have seen. It does things my friends Lexus wishes it could!"
mercury,mariner,2009,09mariner, 05/08/2009,Bad transmission(s),3,"Overall, the worst car we've ever owned.  With 26,000 miles, it's already on the second transmission, and this one is not right.  It's been in the shop more than 60 days so far this year.  My wife is scared to drive it, as it's sometimes in the wrong gear at the worst possible time (other transmission issues too).  There are others online (and in person) with transmission issues also.  As nice as the other features are, none of them make up for this aweful experience.  My suggestion is to wait a year for Ford to figure out the transmission before taking the plunge on this car."
mercury,mariner,2009,RLDA, 08/30/2009,I got more than I had expected.,4,"Took her on a 3000 mile vacation.  MPG exceeded the sticker--plenty of room-- and best of all, My wife (who has arthritis) was comfortable the whole time.  Nice interior, a little noisy on start up, but a great overall experience.  I wanted to buy a non- bankrupt American car (I own two BMW's). Ford is going to score on this type of performance."
mercury,mariner,2009,Shirley, 09/17/2009,It's a looker!!!,5,"In May I purchased my first Mariner and I have to say I love driving it!  I read the Editor's Review on this vehicle before buying and I'm happy that I was able to overlook the rather negative review. It's interesting to me that so many people continue to check out my vehicle especially when some of them are driving BMW and Lexus. Not bad for a vehicle with a ""nine-year-old platform"". The Mariner is very easy to handle and has all the features that I was looking for. My 12 yr old daughter and her friends love riding in it at night for the ambient lighting. My only negative would be the silver coating around the radio controls, gear shift and door handles. It may be hard to keep looking nice."
mercury,mariner,2009,marinerowner, 10/12/2009,Transmission Issues,4,"I bought this car and within 2 days it was back at the dealership. Brand new transmission.  Still having issues. Lady in my yoga class having same exact issues with same exact car! This is not just one-off problem, seems to be a major concern with all the same make & model. Service techs at dealership act like this is my problem -- told me hesitation/delay on new cars is ""normal"". I have a 5-7 second delay with this car after pressing the gas -- car is lurching, zooming, hesitating, stalling. Almost had a few accidents. Not worth the $$$/aggravation. If it was NOT for this issue, this car would be a ""winner""."
mercury,mariner,2009,l_chicago, 05/19/2010,Major Transmission Problems,3,"I bought my 2009 Mariner Premier V6 AWD last April. It was running perfectly--gorgeous looking car. 4 weeks ago the transmission was having ""issues"" brang it back to the dealership and they told me that the transmission has to basically be rebuilt. An issue that they are becoming aware of in the 2009 Mariner. They fixed the trans. Today I had to take it back in because the warning light for the powertrain fault came on. It took them 3 hours to tell me that the issue is a computer issue related to the transmission. They have to take the trans out to figure out why the ""fix"" didn't work, if they can't figure it out, they need to replace the trans! A 1 year old car shouldnt have trans problems!"

I have previously test driven a 2008 and my 2009 is so much smoother and quieter. The steering is also much better. I have all the bells and whistles(moon roof, heated seats, dual air, navigation system, SYNC)  and love my Mariner.  "
mercury,mariner,2009,lovemynewcar, 11/05/2009,LOVE IT!!!,5,I bought my car used a month ago and I love it!!! My only complaint is a few cosmetics scratches that were on it when I purchased the vehicle.
mercury,mariner,2009,ILS, 02/01/2010,2009 Mercury Mariner,3,"Within the first 6000 miles the transmission began to ""clunk"". I took it to the Dealership and was told it was a ""characteristic"" of the transmission. It is loud and it sometimes takes a second to ""engage"" and then the ""clunk"". I am not happy about this. The material on the drivers seat is loose and ""puckered up"" where I sit. I weigh 120 lbs and I am the only driver. Looks terrible! Sync is a great feature for phones but it is not compatible with my cell phone! Forget trying to figure out the Media! Even the dealersip didn't have a clue. I buy a new car every 2 years and this is the first American Car I have purchased new, wont do that again."
mercury,mariner,2009,Paul K. straker, 10/22/2008,Very Safe Ride.,4,I just got my 2009 Mariner early Oct. 2008. On Oct.17 2008 I was taking my boys over to their friends going 40 MPH on a main street when a car ran a stop sign. Never seeing the other car I plowed right into it. Both front airbags deployed. Myself my oldest age 11 and my youngest age 5 all walked away from the wreck with a couple of bruises. My youngest was also in his booster seat which is a must for anyone of his age. I am very great full on how safe they made this vehicle. I can not wait until I get my new one and I will be getting another Mariner.
mercury,mariner,2009,owensry, 11/25/2008,Awesome SUV! Sync is great!,5,"I love the 2009 Mariner. The Sync system is great, along with the leather heated seats, and the black on black colors. The handling is great, has lots of power on the new 240HP V6 engine, along with great fuel economy. I recommend everyone to go for the V6 engine instead of the I4. Has more horsepower and isn't much less of a fuel difference. "
mercury,mariner,2009,Desert Mariner, 01/25/2009,Happy so Far,5,"I never expected to buy a Ford product, haven't owned one in over 25 years. I fully expected to by a CRV, RAV4, or Saturn Vue, only reluctantly  looked at Ford/Mercury. Ended up with the Mariner because it was the best combination of styling, comfort, power, and features. The Saturn was my favorite styling but the seating was not comfortable - just too much smaller than the competition. The CRV had bland styling and no bluetooth or any cool features. The RAV4 had roomiest seating but cheap looking interior and the spare on the door was a minus, plus bluetooth only on fully loaded vehicles. Like the Mariner styling; like front grille & rear tailights better than on Ford Escape."
mercury,mariner,2009,Happy Mariner, 05/14/2009,Lovin' my ride,4,"I was a confirmed hater of driving until I bought my new Mariner. I would have gone with an Escape, but the ice blue interior lighting hooked me. (Went with the 4 rather than the 6 to stay within budget). There's a tad less pickup with the 4, but I've merged onto I-95 and reached 60mph with ease. Once in a clutch situation, I had to brake suddenly and hard - there was no fishtailing nor did the brakes lock. Nice. My SO pointed out the three color interior styling on the dash - they're all neutral tones, very classy. Got my exterior color - Ice Blue - and I am one happy motoring sistah.  Icing on the cake - chosen as a recommended vehicle by Consumer Reports."
mercury,mariner,2009,Huey, 05/24/2009,"A ""WoW"" ed",5,"Once a Mercury owner, always will stay one I guess.  I loved my Mariner since I first got into one.  My GF have a CRV and I was never impressed with it, looks too boring. On the other hand, the Mariner just shouted out the word ""FUN""!  Great size!  It is so roomy inside for a compact SUV!  Head-room, knee-room is awesome and so is the storage.  Hugs the corner nice, easy to steer with a very easy ""U-turns"". Rides very easy from the country roads to the highway. Carry the bumps lightly without any ""clunks"" than compared to a ""heavier"" truck-like SUV.  Love the center of gravity feel, a way more stable feel than a Discovery.  It does not feel ""tipsy"" at all on a curve.  Great car again!  "
mercury,mariner,2009,Nat69, 06/24/2009,Great Ride,5,"I just traded in my 2004 Rendezvous for a new 2009 Mariner Premier.  It took the dealer a couple of days to find the color and options I wanted but it was worth the wait.  I got the Premier version to get the color and options I wanted at a lower price. This is a Great Ride, Tunes and Style, it is not boaty like the Buick but has a very smooth ride.  I love the USB port where I have ALL my 12Gb of music availabe via SYNC. Went for a ride through the mountains this pas weekend and got 22.8 MPG with under 500 miles on it, this is absolutly the best and exceeded my expectations. SYNC - you will need to speak clearly and break up your phrase into single words and it works great!"
mercury,mariner,2009,Susan, 07/04/2009,Loving It,4,I've really enjoyed driving my new Mariner.  100 miles every day on farm to market roads in southern Texas.  Averaging 24 MPH and no problems so far except for a small squeak in the center dash when driving over a different type of payment.  Enjoy the Bluetooth and Sync.  Comfortable seating - that surprised me for a compact SUV.  I'd recommend it to another single person or a family with small kids.  
mercury,mariner,2009,jbrooksws, 07/16/2009,From Suburban to Mariner,4,"We have always had suburbans and decided to go small for insurance and economy.  Wanted to go with hybrid, but replacement battery is $8000 and initial car price too high.  Really good car.  4 cylinder is OK but look at the gas mileage.  Seats are too short for thigh, but heated leather is good.  Wish Ford would make 6 way power for all.   Averaging 24 mpg in city 28 on highway.  No maintenance issues so far and we have 8000 miles on car.  We have been to beach and mountains no issue.   Have not noticed that car is particularly noisy or that fans are noisy.  Have had two or three ""clunks"" when shifting.  Decided I need to come to complete stop before shifting.  We would buy again."
mercury,mariner,2009,William Koonce, 08/10/2009,One Month and Going Strong,5,"One month of driving...for what's its worth. I drive a Lincoln...the Mercury is for my wife. The Mercury cabin is quiet on the highway. For an SUV, the ride is incredibly soft, yet possessing none of the roll for a soft, high-sight vehicle. The interior finish is quality, with lines, not gaps. The GPS and all readouts easily show up in reflective sun (something important to me). The vehicle accelerates quickly, possessing power to pass on a hill. The exterior exudes an affluent demeanor. Regarding the platform, I found the expert reviews humorous, as some considered the proven platform old and in need of an upgrade. Give me a proven mature platform over a young, flashy platform any day! "
mercury,mariner,2009,Michael, 08/12/2009,Mileage/Sync,4,"I have driven this vehicle for 2 months and I am very happy with the MPG. I am getting 25 mpg in the city and got 29.5 on my one highway trip. These figures exceed the numbers on the window sticker. Those who worry about performance, you need not. For a four cylinder it is snappy. I think the 6 speed transmission helps . "
mercury,mariner,2009,Maynard, 08/27/2009,Mom's Car,4,We have about 1200 miles on this car. About 23 mpg. The 6 speed auto took a little getting used to. 240 hp definitely makes this Merc fly.  
mercury,mariner,2009,Wildkite, 09/04/2009,Wife Happy...I'm Happy,5,"I searched and drove vehicles for 14 months. No rush here. Ford stepped up on this one. Fit and finish is great. Same platform as the Ford Escape, just a step up on style. This Mercury Premier, AWD, possesses the options I wanted. Fully loaded. Ride is smooth, pickup surprises my wife continually, AC keeps you cool no matter the outside temp, SNYC works great, GPS/SIRIUS display situated on the console perfect, and our remaining two children have plenty of room on the back seats. My wife calls it the perfect Chic' SUV. I ordered the wheel/tire upgrade...recommend you do the same because that option caps off the look. The vehicle rides quiet < 75 m/hr and takes road bumps unusually smooth."
mercury,mariner,2009,bobincinti, 09/22/2009,Much better than the Honda CRV,5,"I purchased a 2009 Honda CRV earlier this year.  It had to be the most uncomfortable car I purchased and it was very disappointing.  Honda missed the mark on that car.  After 8 months and 12,500 miles, I had enough of it and I started looking for a car to replace it.   The Mariner was the 3rd car I drove and I was sold.  The dealer let me take the car for the morning and I racked up 90+ miles on the test drive.  Excellent car, very comfortable, etc.  The comfort is what sold me.  The bluetooth and ipod ports are nice, I now need a new phone and speech recognizable player to match the features of the car.  If you are looking at a CRV, you need to look at this car.  "

It rides great, has great performance, and is an all around good vehicle. It may not be as refined as some of the newer platforms on the market, but it gets the job done. We looked at toyota, honda, and other manufactures, but decided to buy american and haven't regretted it. The distance to empty display is great, as well as the sound system. The ride is SUV like, and it is great in the snow.(16"" of unplowed snow and didn't get stuck)"
mercury,mariner,2009,sjmst, 08/21/2010,Great Little SUV,4,"I just bought a used 09 Mariner I4. I had a V8 07 Ford Explorer. I actually like the Mariner better. The Explorer was smooth and quiet, but still felt a little sluggish, even with the v8. The Mariner handles better and is more fun to drive. The 4 cyl is buzzy on acceleration and at times at stoplights. Cruising at highway speeds it is quiet and smooth and plenty powerful, even with four of us and luggage."

I am waiting to find out if it was totaled, but hope it is not.  I was able to walk away from an accident that totaled the other vehicle.  All of the airbags went off, and I feel very lucky.  I love my car and have truly enjoyed driving it!  Gas mileage is good, the dealer was/is great and I wouldn't think of buying anything else!

So far, we are thrilled with the car. It replaces a Honda Civic that was totaled. We have a baby coming in 4 months, and we were shopping Mariners anyway for more space. What you get for the price, in a manageable size, in such a nice looking vehicle really sealed the deal for us. Some of the ""newer"" designs were more expensive and did not offer as many features. We feel we got a very nice vehicle with lots of options in a nice package that we'll still have a very reasonable car payment and actually be able to put some cash away in the baby's college fund!"

It has all the bells and whistles and I absolutely love this ride! I would recommend it to anyone and am  pissed they stopped making mercury vehicles.

mercury,mariner,2010,Carole H., 03/29/2018,Sorry I Waited So Long,5,"Dollar for dollar, this super-roomy, 5-passenger SUV is a great buy. Heated seats are surely welcome on those cold, snowy/rainy days. Enough bells and whistles to make driving it an absolute pleasure. Even filling the tank is a breeze given it's fuel-easy, no-cap tank. And regular gas is all that's required. Gotta love it! Both around town and long distance driving are a breeze: comfortable ride, cruise control, phone/radio and cruise control buttons on the steering wheel, voice-controlled Bluetooth and Sirius, CD player, auto headlights, auto lock/unlock, backup warning, plenty of storage and fold-down rear seats in case you need more, privacy windows, roomy console with lost of space, two cup holders for front seats, two for back seats , mood lighting (choice of colors with the push of a button), USB port, input jack, etc. Dollar vs value, I don't think you can beat this SUV. Can you get more features in an SUV? Of course, but you'll pay more too."

Got exactly what I wanted with this.  It zooms past other larger vehicles, although I did get the V6 Premium model.  Got a great deal on it too, so don't limit yourselves to the base model as the premium is more affordable than one would think!  Will keep this till it kicks the bucket.  Had a Chevy Tracker prior and it couldn't hold a candle to this, and before that a Mercury Tracer.  Love this as much as I did my Tracer."

I decided to treat myself, and moved up to the top of the line Mariner Premium for my  new car.  This has a new V6, new 6 speed auto, and most options. The optional stereo with Sync is great, I'm still learning the features.  The ride is comfortable but solid, acceleration is comparable to the old V6, but much quieter.  My daughter said the ambient lighting gives it a spaceship feel."

I traded in a 2007 Saturn Aura which was rated as North American Car of the Year, in reality, it was one of the worst, just behind a 1982 American Eagle & 1978 Chrysler Labaron. The Mariner rides smooth and solid over all road types including those classed as rough.  Fit & finish are excellent.  A bit more than I wanted to spend, but I am well pleased with its initial quality and the way it drives, it is one the easiest driving vehicles that I can recall ever driving. Would I buy this car again ? Yes, without reservation.  "
mercury,mariner,2010,sandy, 05/05/2010,Awesome vehicle,5,"This is by far the best SUV I have owned. Since it is a top safety pick by the Insurance Institute of Highway Safety, my insurance rates actually dropped. Fun to drive, to zip around town, or I take it to visit the coast. Great Size. Great gas mileage. very convenient and easy to drop the seats for a cargo area for my dogs. A true ""Family"" vehicle. I'll buy another, but can't imagine the technology getting any better than the SYNC phone audio system. AWESOME!"
mercury,mariner,2010,MarinerDriver, 05/01/2010,interior,3,"Overall, happy with Mariner Premier FWD. I get 26 mpg on mostly highway. Fun to drive! Heated leather seats get too hot, too fast. Other reviews correct about headliner having frayed exposed cut edge. Dealership says its a Ford design flaw they can't do anything about. Navigation system is not the easiest to pick up without reading manual. Rear view camera is great. Like watching TV! My new car had a scratch in paint that dealership smoothed out, but is still visible. Smooth ride. Side step bars, don't get: just get pants dirty when get in/out. Lots of head room. 4 cyl not too peppy but fuel economy makes up for that."

The big rebates/incentives and good gas mileage (for an SUV) were huge motivators in my decision to purchase a M.M. I was surprisingly shocked at how much I like this SUV. My MPG gauge tells me I am getting 27, great, smooth ride, love the interior & the sun roof. An extra plus is the sync system which I have finally mastered."

Brakes not firm enough for me, need rear disc. Gas mileage varies but for the most part is very good. The I4 engine labors to get up to speed but then does OK to maintain, cruise control helps with mileage on highways. Wish I had opted for the V6 but thought the mileage would be poor. Ok car for now but I do not know if I would purchase another one. "

mercury,mariner,2010,Robert, 12/16/2009,Mariner Premier,4,Car rated as 21 - 28 mpg.  Was initially pleased as I got 22+ mpg in town.  Then I took a trip to Nashville (902 miles roundtrip).  Was disappointed when this 4 cylinder returned a miserable 24.3 mpg.  I drove the speed limit using cruise control for almost the entire trip.  Went back to the dealer who stated they had a quite a few people commenting on the weak mileage.  They stated it was because most gas had 1-10 percent ethanol added.  Did not believe it as the SUV I traded in averaged 29-30 mpg for the same trip. It had the same HP engine and weighed only 100 lbs less.  Of course there is a disclaimer on the window sticker stating the mileage may vary between 23- 33mpg.  Guess I'm stuck.  
mercury,mariner,2010,vincent33, 02/15/2014,Car nut... so this shouldn't be.,4,"Was looking for a new ride for my wife.
We have a 2005 Escape and she pretty much loves it.
She set aside a 2002 Highlander and took the Escape from me.
So we recently shopped the New Highlander, Venza, and CRV along with new Escape.
I thought the new Escape fit me like a Mummy box.
Nice for around time, but no room to move around on 300 mile trips.
The new Highlander was big! The Venza, expensive and ridiculous 20"" wheels. CRV the seats don't suit me and she felt it wasn't substantial.
So what do we do... look for a new used ""old style"" Escape.
This Merc was priced better, has some toys like phone interface and the ""jukebox"" and ""nav"" that seems to work well. "
mercury,mariner,2010,ellenmaine, 09/12/2017,"Great SUV, sad for it to end",4,"This SUV has been reliable and steady for me for the past four years. The fit and finish are poor and it's not much to look at in the silver, but it's a solid vehicle. The entertainment system isn't fabulous because the radio (whether Sirius XM or AM/FM) cuts in and out, even in wide open spaces. The leather interior seats have darkened for some reason, making it look as though I work in the coal industry. Instead, I'm an office worker and pride myself on hygiene so this is bizarre. I feel safe in the vehicle and its ride is smooth enough, but road noise is certainly evident. Even with rotating the tires and not putting many miles on each year, it's had the tires replaced every 18 months. No idea why nor can the dealership tell me why because they've ruled out alignment, etc.

I bought the Premier model and enjoy the upgrades. I purchased the 2WD and so far very sufficient for the Chicago weather.  I do like the visibility of the SUV styling. Gas mileage..we'll see how that goes. Too early to tell but it is a SUV. My only complaint at this time is, the noise level. Chicago streets aren't the best but when you hit a bump it sounds like the whole rear end of the vehicle is going to fall out. My old Explorer wasn't even that bad on the bumps.  Maybe that will get better over time. I hope so!  "

mercury,mariner,2011,piqued, 04/19/2013,Love at First Sight,5,"Okay, we were at the car sale so my husband could get a feel of what kind of car I was interested in and what features I wanted.
I wanted a small SUV that would fit in our garage that had two non-negotiable requirements.
The glass on the back-hatch had to open, and I needed map pockets on the back of the front seats.
I spotted the Mercury Mariner (complete with moon roof!) and it filled all of the requirements.
The ride is smooth, the interior is quiet and I find braking assertive. I like the bluetooth phone feature and all the bells and whistles.
Our car and truck are older, so everything is a marked upgade.
The price was excellent, too! Bought it right away!"
mercury,mariner,2011,Andrea, 10/24/2010,We like our Mariner,4,"Love the back up camera in the rear view mirror.  Noticed in riding in the back seat-no grab bars, and no mechanical lock release. We bought this car less than a week ago, got the premier V6, leather seats, dual climate,rear view back up camera and moon roof.  So far like everything.  We have a 2005 Toyota Highlander, which interior-wise is a lot nicer, even without the leather seats. Highlander doesn't have the modern amenities. My husband thinks it feels more like a truck then SUV, I think it is because it sits up a bit higher, and the front is slightly longer. Thought we would try Mercury-My dad has always bought Fords, and we always had good luck with them lasting a long time!"
mercury,mariner,2011,disappointed73, 09/12/2012,A total disappointment,1,"Two months after purchasing my 2011 Mariner 4 cylinder the rear window exploded.
Even though the dealer claimed ignorance to the issue I found many occurrences on the internet proving it was a known defect.
The air conditioner quit working next.
Took the dealer 3 attempts to fix it during the hottest period in Wisconsin in decades.
Next a defective alternator pulley required 3 days at the dealer.
Since the replacement of the pulley the air conditioner has quit working again.
The warranty will expire very soon.
Now I just want to get rid of the car.
Had enough."

My daughter found this car and said I really needed to see it. It had everything I was seeking, AND it was a great chick mobile as well! Very stylish, easy to handle around town, it made a real statement in cashmere white. This VOGA Edition was also all wheel drive! The heated seats, Bluetooth accessibility, rear parking sensors and illuminated cabin were fabulous additions. The dealership was so amazingly supportive that I would give them 10 stars! Price wise was very reasonable as well. A small adjustment had to be made and Chris wouldn't let it leave the lot until it was 100% perfect. I drove 2 hrs each way to purchase this car and it was well worth it!

mercury,mariner,2011,lilj509, 07/28/2012,Ok for to and from but not a big city vehicle,3,"It was time to get a new vehicle, and the salesman said it was ""zippy"" for a 4 cylinder.
It seemed ok when I took it for a test drive on surface streets, but after getting it on the highway, I realized it is not at all ""zippy.""
It has no pick up and go, especially when you have anyone else in the car or anything heavy in the car.
It would be great for an older couple who are just going to and from the store, etc., but living in a big city and merging on and off of the highway, this car really is a disappointment.
The body style is a little out-dated but at least it doesn't look like a bug, like most newer SUVs do.
It gets 24 miles/gallon.
The digital fuel gage is rarely accurate."

I have the V6 AWD Premier model and it has plenty of power, the comfort is awesome, and it drives better than most cars.

I have now driven the Hybrid slightly over 1500 miles. It has the premium accessory package including the moon roof.  Fuel economy checks closely with the published figures.  Overall I am getting just over 30 mpg.  So far, I very much like the vehicle, it handles well on all types of roadway, it has excellent visibility, and gives a fairly comfortable ride. Acceleration is adequate. Being rather tall, I appreciate the headroom and easy access."

I've done lots of city, highway and offroad driving with no major complaints.  Its the size an SUV should be.

But since there are few SUV ""True Hybrids"" out there, this one scores pretty well. Overall I really like it. It is fairly fun to drive, gets decent mileage (27 overall - great for a 4WD SUV), has surprising performance, has Nav, etc. There are downsides... It's ridiculously priced - 33K for an Escape w/a Hybrid drive! It should be in the 25-27K range when compared w/similar SUV's (assuming a 5K Hybrid markup). Buy it used like I did - paid 27k w/only 1,700 miles on it. Other than the Nav/Radio, inside it's a very plain (and dated) Ford product. CD changer under the seat is insane. And the seat cushions are too short."

After a couple of thousand miles I still really enjoy the experience of the drive. My boys love it (they hated the Odyssey we traded in) and it has become my commute vehicle and the one we thrash around in on weekends. A bit small luggage carrying-wise so we picked up a Yakima luggage carrier. I would love to hear if anyone has really driven it on soft sand. I am a little suspect of that claim."

Both my children are learning to drive and they also prefer the Mariner. It's fun to drive, agile, accelerates like a V8, and comfortable. Plenty of room for five adults. I still use the Explorer for hauling large loads or hunting with my retriever, but the Mariner is my first choice."

My previous cars being 2 Mountaineers, a Ford Explorer, & a sports car, in that order, it does seem small & car-like to me. It did very well last week in a close encounter with a large deer. Parks easily in the city, keeps up will with semi's on the freeway (I drive 35 miles to work in the city & live in the country down a 1100 ft long drive.)  It is an excellent utility vehicle; doesn't haul as much as a larger ute, but then it gets much better gas mileage & stills hold a lot of gardening gear & plants in the back. Very quiet drive; fit & finish is very, very good.  (Yes, I'd buy another one & recommend it to friends.)"

mercury,mariner-hybrid,2006,rmm966, 02/15/2006,MILEAGE 29.4 MI/GAL HWY - SAME AS EPA,5,"After hearing so many reports of EPA mileage not being accurate, I was surprised that the mileage on my new Mercury Hybrid SUV was as advertised. (About 29.4 mi/gal HWY. 366 mi on 12.5 gal of gasoline.)  The ride is nice, the interior is above average, and the automatically adjusting volume on the radio is a cool feature. I like the SUV style and the great $2600 tax credit this year for buying a Green SUV - but that being said, the lack of a third row seat makes it only a so-so choice if you have more than three kids.  If the SUV style and tax credit are not important to you, you might be happier opting for the 2007 Camry Hybrid when it comes out later this year."

The Mariner is supposed to get 29 highway and 33 city. The 29 highway is attainable. I think the 33 city is a tad ambitious but probably could be done if you do a LOT of driving at 25 mph or less. I've gone through two tanks of gas and so far have gotten it up to 28 mpg. You have to have a very light foot on the accerator. If you're really good, you can get the Mariner up to 30 mph before the gas engine kicks in. I love driving it and it's great sitting at lights for minutes at a time knowing that I'm not burning any gas. Trying to conserve fuel makes you allow more time to get where you're going."
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2006,cedar70726, 06/20/2006,Excellent SUV,4,This car features extremely nimble handling. This is strengthened by strong low-end torque provided by the electric motor. For a small SUV interior space is surprisingly large. Seems well made with a rigid body structure that makes it feel very safe. Excellent visiblity in every direction. Hybrid components work flawlessly together.When willing to  drive the speed limit (city or highway) I consistenly get around 30 mpg. Very careful driving will do even better in town. Unfortunately the car invites a heavy foot which drops the mileage to 25 or less. Still this is way better than our '05 Jeep Grand Cherokee.

Drivability, amenities, and comfort are excellent as other reviewers have stated.

You have to be willing to change the way you drive is KEY to buying a hybrid. The navigation feature is super and easy to use. The moonroof opens further than ""standard"". The only problem has been a software issue with the on- board computer which the Dealer is making every effort to correct. If everyone's car turned off like mine in stop'n'go traffic or carpool line, then we won't emit so many greenhouse gases and not be so dependent on oil.

mercury,mariner-hybrid,2007,4peoplefamily, 08/16/2006,FUV - Fun and Useful Vehicle,4,"We just bought pre-released 2007 MMH. Drove for 120 miles the first two days.  Pickup is quick for a 4-cylinder, ~2 ton vehicle. Softer and quieter ride than expected (except going up steep incline at greater than 65 mph - the engine revs rather high to get the needed power).  It's a blast to drive trying to stay in EV to get the best economy."
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2007,Fab, 09/13/2006,Awesome,5,"Love it! Fun to drive - feel good about it being a Hybrid.  Makes me want to take a road trip. Great performance, averaging 32 mpg."
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2007,Mary Wynn, 11/09/2006,LOVE my Hybrid,4,"This SUV drives as well as any car we have ever owned - from a lincoln to a rabbit.  It handles so well, I feel very secure behind the wheel when I drive.   "
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2007,John Bernards, 08/19/2007,Mariner Review,5,I drive many short trips taking grand children to and from school and events. The trips are frequent but unscheduled. Many of the trips are 2 miles or less. I have had no problems with the vehicle and am getting over 25 MPG. Excellent vehicle.
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2007,07Merc, 01/09/2010,Nightmare to own,1,I bought this vehicle in 2007 few months after I buying it I needed new floor mats. I have had to replace the navigation system once for overheating but the replacement parts still over heats. The CD changers works when it wants I only use this option rarely because I have had issues since day one. The seat heaters kick on at random. Keyless entry works when it wants too. I have had it in the shop on numerous occasions for ABS issues. Come to find out the ABS sensor and tone ring can't handle winter weather. When I take the vehicle in for most of the issues the magic phrase is there is nothing wrong with it. My wife and I have experienced the same issues.  
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2007,Newf-car, 08/26/2006,Take this you nasty oil companies,5,"We love it!  We averaged 31.4 MPG on the trip home from the dealer, and are getting 35 on the drive to and from work.  Plenty of power when you get on it to merge into traffic.  The navigation system was a snap to use.  put in the CD click NAV and select where you want to go.  I had heard complaints about the interface but after using it makes we worry that people who find it difficult are behind the wheel.   Plenty of room, our horse...oh I mean newfoundland dog has plenty of room in the back and seems to be really enjoying his new wheels."
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2007,Dian, 08/12/2008,Love my hybrid!,4,"OK so it's not a high priced sports car (I have one of those as well) and it isn't high powered monster SUV (My husband drives one of those). However, for what it is: economical, comfortable, nimble and reliable (so far) I love it! Yes, it was high priced, but packed with every option, so that's not so horrible. The one down side is that the nav could be better.  I'm not asking it to compare to the ones I've had in my luxury cars, or the aftermarket in my husband's Suburban, but I would really like to see some improvements there. Still, it;s fun to drive, easy to park, and very practical. I get 30 MPG without the AC and 27 with AC.  Can't complain about that!"
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2007,Jim, 01/15/2009,2007 Mecury Mariner Hybrid,4,"We love our car, comfort, turning radius, excellent visibility. Fuel mileage runs 26 in town and 33 mpg on the highway. The front wheel drive is great and when it is needed 4x4 is seamless. We needed a car that will climb an 8% grade coming from our driveway. This has served us way better than all wheel drive. The body is nice and tight the doors close with no effort. Our car is front wheel drive with auto 4X4 when needed not AWD."
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2007,Whirl-E-Brid Man, 01/19/2007,Sage Mariner w/o all the optional stuff.,5,Not too big and not to small.  It's just right says me.  Cloth seats.  Solid ride.  Quiet.  Fun to Drive.  The standard equipment is just fine.  The gas mileage averages about 30.5 mpg overall in my driving situation which includes about 16 miles of some what rural 2 lane roads that are not congested.
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2007,PCollins, 03/12/2007,07 MMH Loaded,5,"Would buy again if I had to do all over again.  Love the look of this SUV!  Got up to 30 MPG already during a trip to mall, only have 400 miles on it.  I have a feeling if this keeps up, the MPG will be over what is advertised.  Block heater and high volt battery preheater should be standard."
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2007,HYbrid, 03/29/2007,MMH,4,"Mariner is much nicer inside than Escape hybrid.  Love the chrome accents, and two tone leather seats.  The hybrid nav system is a very nice piece of technology."
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2007,gandk262, 05/21/2007,Brilliant!,5,"This is amazing. Great mileage, comfort, solid construction - in fact, I was rear-ended at a red light in March and the vehicle that hit me was totalled. Despite the speed at which I was hit  I was well protected.  The rear gate, bumper, spare tire, cargo bed and battery took the brunt of the hit but I was fine.  Fortunately, so were the occupants of the other vehicle. And the mileage?  Wow!  We'd always avoided SUVs on principle, but if your lifestyle really demands one, this is the way to go.  "
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,Jon M, 07/22/2016,Decent option for an all year vehicle,3,"I currently live in Wisconsin, so the weather can vary greatly between the snow and heat. I needed something that can get me through each season, which is why I chose a used Mercury Mariner Hybrid 2008 AWD. I successfully added my own receiver and mounted in under the gps receiver that comes with the car (which I spliced into the cigarette lighter power and ground), and added a 10 inch sub in the back. I can confirm this vehicle can power an extra receiver/sub/amp/ and the hybrid battery can handle rumbling from the sub even when the sub is directly on top of the compartment that the hybrid battery is in.  In the winter time, this vehicle can get through snow pretty easily, and can handle ice with below 0 temperatures. In the summer, the car has not overheated in over 100 degree f temperatures. The interior is made with poor material but looks nice. The outside looks decent but has some rust above the wheels, and the paint has survived 8 years and still looks decent. The speed limit where I live is 70mph on the highway, and when going 70mph I maybe get 23-25 mpg average. If I go around 65mph I get 24-27mpg average. So no, you probably wont get 29mpg as advertised on the highway unless you are going way under the speed limit. When in town, if you stop quickly or are going slow, (usually slower than 25mph) the hybrid battery mode will kick in, which just uses hybrid battery power and not gas. This also makes the car almost silent, however you have to be going pretty slow for the battery to stay on, otherwise the engine turns back on. in town if you are going fairly slow, you can achieve up 60mpg with the battery fully on. If you are varying slow and fast speeds, you should be able to get at least 25-40 mpg in town. The only issues I have had was my steering column started to fail, and it costed me around $1000 to fix. Also one tie rod needed to be replaced, and both of the front wheel brake sensor and tone rings needed to be replaced. Lastly my transfer case had to be replaced, but this is most likely due to the 22 inch rims I used to have on the vehicle. Overall, for a used hybrid mini suv that also has AWD, this is a pretty decent buy.
"
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,tonyrita, 03/07/2013,Cargo area above the battery catches fire,4,"I've had my Mercury Mariner for 5 years and had no issues other than a new set of tires and brakes.
Last week after making a local trip, I parked my Mariner in the garage and 2 hours later the car caught fire and burned most of my garage and my wifes car.
I'm warning current and future owners of this car so nobody else has to go through this pain."
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,carricrf, 03/28/2011,Wow... What a great value and fun car,5,"Was searching for a good value in a used Hybrid car.
Was concerned about performance, price and reliability. Did my research on this car and was very impressed with performance, handling, features and style. I would highly recommend and would suggest that if interested, you take one for a drive and see what I mean. I have a Fusion that I like as well, but this really has been a great choice!
Performs like a powerful 6 cyl, but gets 30+ MPG combined milage (my real experience).
Comfortable and gets positive comments from my family and friends like it was a New Car!"
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,rhaman, 02/16/2015,Above average,4,"This is my first Ford product and the first car that had rust. Rust developed on both rear fenders on the top section. I found out this is common to Ford vehicles of this style. It has to do with the welding or how the two sections were fitted at the factory that allows moisture to collect. The vehicle is excellent. Not perfect but we wanted a fuel efficient SUV for traveling. It does that.  The seats could be more comfortable. This a Premium model that comes with a $3.00 radio antenna. Handling in snow, mud is superb. With proper use of the throttle it can go about 1 mile on electric at slow speeds. I have logged 45 MPG on a 12 mile run on back roads. I average 33 MPG. My wife averages 28. "
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,arockcastle, 05/16/2011,Pretty Good SUV,2,"I got this SUV because it met my needs perfectly.
It got good fuel economy, had four-wheel-drive, and was still big enough for me to fit me and my stuff.
Despite this, the car isn't always that comfortable.
The ride is bumpy, and there is a lot of engine, wind, and road noise.
The exterior styling looks pretty boring, and the interior materials feel cheap.
So far, I'm getting about 30 MPG in the winter and 35 MPG in the summer (mostly highway driving).
Overall I'm happy with this car, but I can't say I would recommend it.
There are many cheaper cars that are more comfortable and get almost as good of fuel economy, like the Subaru Forester, Toyota RAV4, or even a new 2012 Ford Focus."
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,satisfied7, 02/12/2011,My three years with the Mariner Hybrid,4,"I put a lot of miles on my car with my sales job. When I first drove one, the seats fit me comfortably and it sat nicely. up high and with good back support. After three years, I couldn't be happier. I average 30.5 miles per gallon on my half highway, half city driving and it's peppy enough for me at the age of 56. I love my Sirius radio along with my navigation system. It won't have the pickup of cars I've owned in the past but how often do you really need it. When I've needed it, it responded adequately. I've put 105,000 miles on it in just over three years and all I've done is get the oil changed and kept up with the required maintenance at my dealer. I love it."
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,ams, 06/22/2009,Road Noise,4,"Biggest complaint about this vehicle is the road noise from below when driving.  My husband, who drives a Diesel,  comments every time he gets in this car about how noisy it is and I have to agree.  I am surprised to see all these reviews claiming 30+ MPG.  I have had this vehicle almost 2 years now and on average, 26-28 MPG is what it gets. "
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,BRocker, 06/01/2008,Great gas mileage,5,I had the Mariner for 5 months now. Excellent vehicle to drive.  Averaging 31+ MPG mixed mode driving.  I drove a 200 mile trip recently and averaged 33+ MPG. Great vehicle. Roomy interior. I love the sunroof and enjoy trying to get the best gas mileage. Traded in a Dodge Caravan (14+ MPG) saving lots of money.
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,MM, 07/07/2008,Ford/Mercury Out did themselves! Wow!,5,"I researched this vehicle for 6 over months. After so much anticipation would it live up? I took the keys in Aug 07 and have never been happier. It surpassed my dreams! It is fun to drive, but you do need to be watchful. I have scared folks, when running on the electric motor, all you can hear are the tires on the ground. Which can be eerie. The kids tease it is quieter than the 'Barbie' Car! We have taken it on a major vacation 700 miles one way for 12 hours and it did great. 31 mpg. Saved us 1/3 cost in gas over our Windstar while not losing comfort. Handled the mountain curves. The navigation system was helpful but gave warnings in some areas. Ford has out done themselves with this one!"
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,b hughes, 12/19/2007,Love this Mariner Hybrid!,5,"I did quite a bit of research before buying a new vehicle.  I drove them all from Honda, Toyota, Kia, Saturn, Hundai, Dodge, Chevy and the Ford Escape Hybrid.  It drives nicely and is very comfortable.  I like the exterior and interior design. So far, so good!  I give it a ten!"
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,SGOODFEL, 10/01/2008,Great Vehicle!,4,"I totally love my hybrid. I am averaging 30 mpg on my daily commute. What a great change from the 16-17 mpg on my Venture mini-van. Beware - you will totally become obsessed with how well your gas mileage can be. My high is 35 mpg and my low was 28 mpg (highway miles on a trip through the WV moutains). There are a couple of small things I wish it had:  bluetooth and the built-in garage door opener. Other than that, the vehicle is perfect! I definitely recommend."
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,JCB, 12/31/2007,2008 Mercury Hybrid,4,Very nice luxury SUV with good value. Good looking vehicle. Interior is quite well-done. Drive is much more spirited than anticipated. Good in ice and snow. Excellent mileage. Great audio package. Navigation feature is quite handy and easy to use. Transmission takes getting used to but is not a problem.  Would purchase again without question
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,Rafael ( Miami), 01/18/2008,Finally...I have my SUV Hybrid and Happy,5,"Your comments and reviews have help me so much in this buy process...now its my turn. I saw this SUV in the Miami Int'l Car Show and loved it. Once the show was over, I called 2 dealerships in Miami and found it. Test drove it, negotiated a great price and bought this beautiful Black Mariner Hybrid, leather seats,big moonroof and lots of other extras. Love the way it drives, excellent gas mileage, 30 to 31 MPG, very confortable.mM neighbor is a Prius owner and he was so impressed with the space and confort of this SUV. You get it all with this SUV, enviromentally friendly, great MPG, easy on the eyes :)  I'm an ex Saab owner and this SUV makes me smile every morning."
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,Disappointed, 08/04/2010,You've got to be kidding!,2,"I recently acquired a 2008 Mariner with 25K miles.  I could not imagine a more uncomfortable and noisy vehicle.  The vehicle is extremely loud as the variable drive whines and the engine roars when engaged.  The car in general is just loud.  This car is loaded with leather, NAV, etc and it is extremely uncomfortable.  I have a 25 mile one-way commute and I can not get to my destination fast enough.  The only good comment I can provide is that the gas mileage is great as I am averaging 29+ consistently.  Test drive and compare to other vehicles in this category thoroughly before you decide (btw, this is the brother to the Ford Escape and I would expect a similar experience)"
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,AfshinK, 09/25/2007,Exceeded High Expectations!,5,"I have had it for 3 weeks now and it has exceeded my high expectations in every way!  I have gotten 36 MPG on two tankfuls of gas so far in mixed city/highway driving.  Plenty of power from the engine and a very smooth, quiet ride.  It's very cool to drive in all-electric mode knowing you're actually doing something to help the environment."
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,Norton, 06/26/2007,Fantastic SUV,5,"Love the handling, mileage and yes, the power. Plenty of passing power. And with 36+mpg, few trips to the gas station!"
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,Alex Dawson, 04/08/2008,Great car and very very quiet!,5,"My first SUV and I loved the car from the first moment, it is so quiet when you drive in town that you need to be extra aware of pedestrians who won't hear you. Mileage is very good to, so far its at 31 MPG and we have mostly driven on freeways. The weakness would be that it is not very strong and the engine needs to run on pretty high RPM (over 4000) going up the steepest hills in San Francisco. "
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,Barb, 06/21/2008,Great car,5,"Just returned from a 3410 mile road trip. Included interstates (30, 10, and 59) and old state highways, average mileage was 32+/mpg. Kept up with the 18 wheelers on the nightmare that is 10 in Louisiana without a problem, ""Little blue"" did everything I asked. Cargo capacity was more than sufficient for two old boomers on a retail therapy binge. Parallel parking on a crowded street in old town Willimington was a breeze! After 4 1/2 months driving this car I'm happier than I was when it was finally delivered!  Did not get the on board navigation system, (I can read a map) just added leather seats to the standard Mercury package."
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,Works4me, 07/28/2008,SkimpyRider,4,"Pros: Excellent vehicle with surprisingly good stability-very close to Hondas' roadability. Tight turning radius a big plus. Lots of fun to drive. Cons: Center led display of time, temperatures etc. cannot be see in bright sunlight. GPS/radio screen could be brighter and crisper (higher resolution)."
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,Diane, 08/18/2008,Just what I wanted,5,"Fortunately I bought this 10 months ago before gas got even worse. I love the car and being geograhpically impaired, I love the GPS navigation although I could have saved money and bought a hand held. I'm nervous about ice and snow, so I got the all wheel drive version, but still the mileage is great (over 30 consistently). Ford has a winner here, and for the price, it is very competitive with some other crossover/SUVs I looked at. My husband now wishes he had one too."
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,uvabeachbum, 01/17/2008,Very happy,5,"Purchased this vehicle in June as a trade for my gas sucking minivan.  So far I have been impressed with everything. With 2 kids, we have had no space issues. "
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,HappyHybridOwnr, 06/17/2009,Best Mariner Hybrid,5,I had the Mariner for 16 months now.  Excellent vehicle to drive.   Averaging 31+ MPG mixed mode driving.  Great vehicle with a very Roomy interior.   I enjoy trying to get the best gas mileage. Traded in a GMC Safari (17+ MPG) saving lots of gas $.
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,John Dixson, 02/12/2008,Henry Ford Would Be Proud,5,"With 1500 miles on this car, I can report that it performs exactly as the sales literature proclaims, and isn't that a rarity. I routinely average 34.8 mpg around town and 31.4 on I-95 here in South Florida. Handling is stable and predictable, cruise control is tight in terms of holding speed, and the nav/audio/energy flow displays work well. Nav system is certainly superior to the nav in our 2006 E-Class Diesel.  Only 1500 miles, but zero discrepancies on this vehicle. Delivery quality control was excellent: for example, upon driving the vehicle home, I checked all tire pressures, and each one of the four was exactly 35.5 psi."
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,bobmetro1, 03/12/2007,glad I waited,5,"Just have it for a few days but I already know I'm going to love it.  The new improved Mariner is far superior to the 2007.  Solid ride, almost no wind noise, nice large screen for the nav system. So far I'm averaging 28-1/2 mpg in mixed driving conditions."
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,efonte, 03/30/2007,Great ride!,5,"I haven't had it long, but I love the vehicle.  I'm averaging about 30.5 mpg on mixed driving. Acceleration, has plenty of power and the ride is very smooth.  "
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,Transpower, 04/09/2007,Big Improvement Over Previous Models,5,"With the blacked-out B-pillars, the 2008 model looks more grown-up than the 2005-2007 models. The CD player is now in the center stack not under the passenger seat, the navigation screen is much bigger and is touch-screen and utilizes a DVD. There is a 110 volt power outlet, and automatic headlamps.  The view is commanding. The handling is nimble. The fuel economy wonderful. There is sufficient power to pass tractor-trailers going up steep hills. The brakes have a good feel to them. The steering is well-weighted. The vehicle is very well-balanced front to rear."
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,marinerfan, 04/30/2007,Love the Mariner Hybrid,5,"I love my new AWD Mercury Mariner Hybrid. I was driving an Expedition but wanted a smaller SUV that got great gas mileage. The Expedition was only getting about 13 mpg. The handling is great and braking secure in city driving. Plus, the tax credit for purchasing a hybrid is an added plus.  "
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,Steen, 05/07/2007,Loving Our Hybrid,5,"Have had the SUV for three weeks and am enjoying the experience. This version of the Mariner is much improved, we had a 2005 FWD Premier that was totaled in an accident. Since my partner came out of the accident with no injuries we decided to stick with the Mariner but get the hybrid instead and we love it. The new look is a big step up and comes across as more classy than the precvious version."
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,bobmetro, 03/27/2007,two weeks and very happy,5,Two weeks into the new hybrid and I'm glad I bought it.  It's fun to drive...great response from the steering...rides firm and quiet.  So far averaging 29 MPG in a mix of NYC traffic and highway.  GPS is much better than the 07 reviews I read.
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,ddelano, 04/21/2007,2008 Mercury Mariner 4WD Hybrid,4,"Love the new interior quality and the DVD nav system. Still getting used to the large appearing snout and high beltline, but people are looking and asking. Traded an '07 Escape 4wd hybrid which compared to the '08 is shameful. Many, many more amenities this yr, such as outside temp, compass, dual zone climate control, tire press. monitoring, trick center console, color keyed side view mirrors, thicker laminated glass in front and auto dimming rr view mirror etc.,and the price is about a grand less. This indeed is progress. Bold move? Dunno, but it's got a bold front clip! Great ride!"
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,Darwin, 04/25/2007,WOW,5,"This hybrid is awesome. I bought it for my wife. Ii find that I am trying to find ways to get the keys from her hands. This Mariner is just fun to drive and well appointed. Everything about it just wow. Definitely pleased. Plus the tax incentive will definitely help offset the cost. Must go drive and try out. If you can afford to spend a little more, it's worth it!"
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,SteenAZ, 04/20/2007,So Far So Good,5,Just switched from an '05 Mariner FWD V6 to a 08 AWD Hybrid and we are super impressed. Great redesign of a car we we still liked from the first version. The interior is much improved and seems bigger although it is not. Overall a more upscale looking vehicle. Hybrid engine is a joy to drive. So far we are hitting close to 30 even with the majority of miles being on the highway. 
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,lawlabor, 04/23/2007,Well Pleased,5,"I have had the car for two weeks now and couldn't be happier.  The efficiency is precisely what was projected, the creature comforts have exceeded my expectations, and even my 9-year old son thinks the car is cool."
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,Greg L, 05/03/2007,My 3rd and Favorite Hybrid,5,"Easy to love this car. Great style. Fuel economy and build quality surpassed my expectations. I get the economy of a Civicand the roominess of a mid-sized SUV.  Fully loaded with NAV, and leather under $30K.  I average 30 MPG combined.    "
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,Matrix D., 05/13/2007,Exceeding Expectations,5,"Going from a Cadillac DTS to the Mariner Hybrid, I thought I might be giving up some creature comforts and settling for less, but I'm not. The car handles well, it's fun to drive, I love the visibility of being higher, and I'm totally hooked on seeing how gas efficient I can drive. My husband and I are competing to see who can drive the longest 'for free' in other words, driving just via the battery and with no gas. My regular driving habits are giving me about 30-31 MPG, a significant improvement from the Cadillac's 16-18 MPG average. It's been a long time since I've felt this great about a new car!"
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,Jay McCosh, 07/01/2007,What was Ford thinking?,5,I have only had the car a few days and am blown away. This is by far the most cool car I have ever driven. I don't understand Ford's thinking as it seems this vehicle is not only hard to get but almost an ugly step child to them considering the lack of features and colors compared to the V6. They should pat themsleves on the back for this one and this should be the flagship vehicle for Mercury considering its fun to drive watching and feeling it go into EV modeand with its efficiency and amazing fit and finish. The NAV system is awesome as well as the stereo and free Sirius for 3 years! We liked this vehicle so much both me and my wife got one. 
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,Kimberly, 06/28/2007,It is easy being green!,5,"I love this car. While I miss having my four wheel drive like my previous Honda CR-V had I went with the FWD model of the Mariner Hybrid.  After 10 years of Honda I have returned to Ford via Mercury. It has such a smooth and comfortable ride. My driving is a combination of city and highway and I am pleasantly surprised that even when I shut off the economy to keep the a/c compressor running my gas mileage is still high!  Combo City/Highway in Charlotte NC has been around 29-32 mpg with the a/c running w/economy setting 31-34. This is over 10+ mpg over my 2005 Honda CR- V where I achieved 19 - 24 mpg.  Roomy, comfortable, and fun to drive! No sacrifice in power either."
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,Charles, 09/27/2007,A great vehicle,4,"While I have put less than 1000 miles on my new Mariner, I am quite impressed with the hybrid design and am averaging over 35 mpg.  So far I love the car and the overall design. Lot of room and flexibility.  Ford has done a great job !"
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,TosaGuy, 06/05/2007,Impressed,5,"Last year I test drove the 2007 Ford Escape Hybrid (cousin of the Mariner).  I was underwhelmed. Fit and finish wasn't impressive, it wasn't a very smooth ride, and the nav system was terrible. I found myself in the hybrid market this year instead. I test drove the Toyota Highlander Hybrid and Rav4.  Before plucking down serious $$ for either of these, I decided to test drive the newly redesigned 2008 Mercury Mariner (influenced by reviews on this site).  I have to say the test drive knocked my socks off!  Very plush, top notch nav system, and very smooth ride. I opted for the FWD version.  I avg 29mpg and love it!  Fully loaded, I paid much less than a stripped Highlander!"
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,scoutyjones, 06/08/2007,Very Happy,4,"I have had this car/suv for 4 weeks and it average's 32+ in mixed driving.  If I drive highway miles and it has good accelleration and still average 32+. Not loaded with nav or leather or AWD as we didn't need it. Nice to have but not needed. Car handles very well. Free satellite is welcome but with MP3 link, it's not gonna be missed when gone. All new vehicles should have an MP3 connection. Looks great inside and out, fits 3 adults in back seat comfortably and is quiet. Absolutely love the ride and the technology. Kudos to Mercury for producing a solid ride with MPG/environment in mind. Looking to add top notch car mats and cargo tray for 2 large dogs. "
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,Haole Boy, 09/21/2007,Great SUV.,4,"1. Despite its appearance, this is indeed a compact SUV. Compare all specs w/the Hyundai Tucson for instance and they are very similar. I was surprised to find that it is shorter than my A4. However, the storage is still more than suficient and when driving, you feel safe and like you're driving a larger SUV, and heck, it fits nicely in a smalle townhouse garage. Love both the interior and exterior design. This SUV consitently turns heads. Have put about 900 miles on it, including a 600 mile road trip. Overall averaging a good 31 mpg. It certainly lacks some pep, but that's to be expected from a 4 cyl hybrid SUV. I still have been able to accelerate into high speed traffic satisfactorily."
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,Rick D, 10/03/2007,Easy Driver,5,"This car is easy to own and drive. Minimal pit stops required for both gas and service. Happy with our decision to buy this one.  Comfortable, fun and ease of getting in and out.  ust the right size."
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,Rick Ridder, 11/08/2007,Good vehicle,4,"We have had no problems with it. Drove from Denver to Oregon and back. Averaged 33 mpg. My only complaint is that going up steep hills at above 6000 ft., it tends to be under-powered a bit. Still, it performs better than my Suburu, and has better overall comfort than any of the other vehicles I tested in the same class. Definitely a good vehicle. Very pleased owner."
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,scott4370, 11/25/2007,Environmentally Responsible SUV,5,My wife and I bought the Mariner a week ago. We have always had Toyotas and were skeptical at first. I have to say that this runs better than any other hybrid I have ever driven. The smooth transitions between electric and gas modes are amazing. The mileage is close to what the sticker says. The Mariner is comfortable and fun and Ford deserves a BIG pat on the back for developing this vehicle. I only wish they were not so hard to find. I also hope more people who need an SUV check this one out. It is truly amazing!
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,Joshua Lowe, 04/02/2008,6 months and 12k miles after purchase...,4,"I have owned my hybrid for 6 months now and driven over 12k miles so far. Most driving I do is highway mileage, and I average around 31. When I do drive in the city for periods of time, I average around 34. The engine is loud at times, and seems somewhat underpowered. However, when I accelerate to pass someone on a two-lane highway, the pickup is there. I am disappointed that I have several areas that make noise. The left of the dash rattles on bumps, and a spot in the middle of the dash has started to rattle softly. Recently the tailgate seems to rattle as well. After 12k miles, this is unexpected.  Outside of that, I love the car and have enjoyed my infrequent gas stops. "
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,Ann , 04/02/2008,Love this car!,5,"This has been one of my favorite cars and I traded down from a Lexus GX to buy this.The gas mileage is much better and I love the car for my short trips about town. I have the Kiwi green with white interior with plenty of room for family, dogs and everything else. Fun car."
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,Mariner21, 04/05/2008,Good To go!,4,MPG as advertised. 30-34 around town and highway. Great small turning radius. Very maneuverable. Environmental controls are excellent - heat/air/defog etc.  Delivered fit and finish just fine. Interior molded plastic parts a little on the cheap side - not terrible but not a clean design - bolt/screw fitting visable. Overall - would buy another one. Dealer sales and service support adequate but could use some Toyota/Honda customer/service style training. Mariner Hybrid - good example of why you should buy American. Good wheels! 
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,rollin_steel, 04/08/2008,Love my Hybrid,5,"When stuck in traffic I know I'm not pumping carbon into the air in this already polluted city! $3,000 tax credit this year this model!! Drives like a small SUV but really seems roomy inside. Easy to park. Lots of storage, Comfortable interior designed with tall people in mind! very quiet ride! I only have 1200 miles on it so not totally broken in and I'm getting about 29-30 mph in the city on average. I'm still learning not to hop off the line (jack rabbit starts) smoother means better mph! "
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,Karen, 04/13/2008,11 months Still love it!,4,"I bought my Mercury Mariner Hybrid 11 months ago and have 13,000 miles on it.  We live in Colorado and I've driven over mountain passes, in snow storms and snow packed roads numerous times with no problems.  I traded in a Yukon Denali for better gas mileage. The Mariner was the closest vehicle that I could find that had all the ""doo dads"" like the Denali:  leather seats, nav system, satellite radio, heated seats, sunroof, etc.  I average 31 hwy and 34 mpg in town.  It is much easier to park than the Denali and has a wonderful ride. I've not had any problems with the engine, electronics or anything. If you are looking for an AWD hybrid, this is the best one on the road and it's American."
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2008,Michael Caty, 04/16/2008,Ford quality exceeds expectation!,5,"This truck if priced by the importers would be double the sticker.

mercury,mariner-hybrid,2009,Chas T, 12/14/2017,Hybrid battery surprise,1,"Do not buy this car, unless it's under Warranty.  Also, never, NEVER STORE THIS CAR.  Bought in '09 new from dealer; had all maintenance done by local Ford Dealer (Merc out of business) 80k miles. In 2016 followed book instructions stored for 6 months came back NO start towed to FD ""lost programing"" cost $250; ok, not so bad.  In 2017, again gone for 6 months, checked with FD what to do.  They told me to buy a trickle charger with shut off @ full; this will prevent ""lost programing"".  Got back NO start; again towed to dealer; after a weeks worth of diagnostics; this time the FHV battery wont start the car.  Now get this, they don't have a 300+ volt charger and have to RENT IT from Ford:  Est $1,650! and if it won't hold a charge $14,000 for a new battery.  Checked with Ford (Detroit) told you CAN'T STORE  this car; it has to be driven to continually recharge the FHV (sure enough on page 42 of the owners manual there's three comments that address this, in fact the Ford ""Electric Car"" guy said they tell people if they have leave for longer than 30 days you should have a ""friend"" drive it around once a week for 20 or 30 minutes)  So off to another dealer for a ""second opinion"" had it towed to another FD quoted $240 to charge it up.  Then they called said they had to rent the charger from Ford for $650 & they'll need 2 tech hours; well OK this took 3 weeks for the charger to arrive; whoops, the  battery can't be charged enough to start the car & they think the transmission may need to be replaced:  Cost new HV Battery cost $5k & if needed a new transmission $10K obviously more than the value of the car and OH the 8 year 100k warranty expired 6 months ago.  So, I have a beautiful '09 Mercury Mariner otherwise in top condition, now a very large paperweight.  If only I would have had one of my kids or neighbor just drive the car once a week for 20 minutes.  Conclusion:  the Ford Hybrids are poorly designed & costly to repair.

mercury,mariner-hybrid,2009,teknooh, 07/10/2013,"I really want to love it, but 4 years later...",4,"After owning mine for 4+ years, I've had more problems than I expected.
Most recently, the air conditioning system is being repaired for a second time, and the cost of this repair exceeds what the dealership is authorized to provide (so it has to be Ford approved).
Other fun includes a sensor under the front passenger seat failed and had to be replaced, and early on the SYNC software had to be wiped and completely reinstalled.
Since about 30K miles I've had it in several times for a popping noise (like a bad knee joint) under the hood, and each time they've replaced some other part that was going bad but, the noise still persists.
Unfixable I guess.
Thank god for extended warranties!"
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2009,BC, 10/31/2009,"Great Vehicle, Minor Flaws",4,"I have had this car for almost 3 months now, and am very pleased with it.  I average 31.3mpg with about 60/40 mix of city/highway driving.  I really love driving this vehicle, and its very agile and easy to park.  I'm 6'-3"" and it still has plenty of room and is easy to get in and out of.  Lumbar adjust is useless and obstructed by center console.  TIP--If you notice that your engine does not turn off at stop lights, turn your window defroster off.  The tilt wheel has very limited range adjustment upward.  The mpg is great and varies only slightly between highway & city.  UHAUL makes a drill-free hitch for this vehicle and it is useful for a needed hitch-hauler cargo carrier for trips."
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2009,VR, 09/14/2008,2009 Mariner Hybrid AWD,4,"I've had this for over a month now and am getting great mpg for this sized SUV. Mixed driving, getting over 31  freeway driving at 78mph, getting over 27. The navigation/audio/info system is oustanding. I've just started loading my music into the 10 gig hard drive - no more cd's or tapes to take up space.  I also used a thumb drive in the usb port to play music, this also worked flawlessly. I look forward to getting a bluetooth cell phone and linking that to the sync system. There was enough space for 3 adults and two 60 pound dogs and all our luggage to drive on an 8 hour one way trip comfortably. "
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2009,JM in Killeen, 01/24/2009,"Much Fun, Little Gas",4,"I have owned the car just over 1 month and love the mileage I am getting. So far I am averaging 32.3 mpg overall, over 34 MPG with me driving, 29+ with my wife driving (lead foot). I was very surprised with the accereration of the hybrid system, I test drove the v6 model prior to ordering the hybrid system to see how I liked the overall car and I believe the hybrid is quicker. The passenger space is comparable to larger SUVs, but lacks cargo room for long trips. I would like to see more options, color and materials, for the interior, especially for the primere package. Satillite radio, NAV, sync are all top notch and work well. Overall, a very fun, solid SUV. Great MPG as well as performance."
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2009,berelbr, 08/19/2008,2009 Mercury Mariner Hybrid,4,"This is a perfect SUV for in-town/suburban driving. I have owned the car for a month and a half and we are averaging 33 mpg (not bad for an AWD SUV). I live 15 miles out of town.  Therefore, driving 13 miles on the highway and 2 miles in town I am averaging 33 mpg. There is plenty of cargo space. The back seats fold forward for additional storage space. Overall, this is the best car that I have ever owned. "
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2009,bikerrich, 10/02/2008,2009 AWD MMH,4,"Had it about a month now; enjoying the mileage and the kick of trying to keep it on battery. Nice car for the price.  A bit wallowy. Can't take curves at 60. Suspension needs some improvement. Brake pedal feels fine, don't notice any difference from my other cars."
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2009,JM, 08/15/2009,Overpriced,4,"Good, safe, quality car way overpriced due to dealers ordering with every possible ridiculous option. For example-""ambient lighting"" which I thought cheap/cheesy-something I might have liked when I was 16 rather than an adult. Nav. system is $2000-buy garmin instead or plug laptop into included outlet and use mapquest on the 3+ yrs of wireless you could buy w/ $2k you save. Nav. system includes dvd player that of course only works if you are in park because you can't be trusted that only passengers and not the driver will watch. 10Gig hard drive to hold all your music but only transfer is one CD at a time (no ipod/MP3 xfer), about 10 min/CD. No backup when hard drive fails! Bargain hard!"
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2009,jnt76, 09/04/2008,2009 4WD Mercury Mariner Hybrid,4,"I have owned this vehicle for one week, and have many good things to say about it. Navigation system with Microsoft Sync is awesome. Almost endless music possibilities with Sirius, CD, radio, aux input jack, USB input, and 10GB internal hard drive that you can record your CDs to. Drove up in the Rocky Mts this weekend and avg'd over 30 mpg - and that's with lots of hill climbing. 60 mile highway round trip to work every day, averaging 32+ mpg. Up to 40 mph on battery only. Interior is very nicely done with lots of cargo space for a small SUV. Back seats fold down flat. Ride is very smooth - handles like a car. Can't even tell when gas engine starts and stops, great job of making that quiet."

Ride is smooth and very car like, plenty of power when you need it, and great economy we are averaging 33 mpg so far. The park assist is great, wish it offered an led proximity display, and a back up camera. Plenty of room in the back seat for bigger guys, and cargo room is descent.   "
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2009,Tom, Pgh,Fun to drive,4,"I got this vehicle a week ago, and I'm really enjoying it.  I averaged 37mpg on the first tank of gas, mostly city but some highway travel. Still learning the hybrid and how to maximize mileage, but I'm having fun doing it. The Nav system with the Sync and Sirius is awesome, it does so much. Very tight, handles well and runs well. The small engine has some pep, alittle noisy when you punch it down, but it handles the hills of Pittsburgh with ease.  "
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2009,PghHybrid, 09/30/2008,Fun to drive,5,"I've owned my Mariner Hybrid for a little over two weeks, got 37mpg out of first tank, 34mpg with highway and city on second tank. Very impressed with this vehicle, love the Nav with Sync and Sirius. Mercury hit a home run with this one. Rides very nice, comfortable with loads of front leg room.  "
mercury,mariner-hybrid,2009,JG, 01/01/2009,Great SUV,5,"I wanted to wait until I got to drive this in the snow to give it a full review - and now I have here in New England. I have been very happily surprised in nearly every aspect of this car, from its handling and braking, to its fuel economy, to its overall comfort - in all of them it has excelled. The Navigation and Sync systems are outstanding and fun to explore, with easy-to-use podcasts and music and hands-free phone all projected through speakers, as well as real time traffic re-routing. And it does just fine even in deep snow."

Still push it, having traded in a Lincoln LS for this vehicle.   It feels stable for an SUV, having driven a few.  Quiet is nice. With Hybrid we did not expect as much as we have gotten with drivability.   This is a nice vehicle.   "

mercury,mariner-hybrid,2009,Alexander, 12/04/2019,Not bad gorgeous compact SUV,5,"Not bad gorgeous compact SUV with incredible MPG consumption , in the city it would  be around 30 or even 35, 
runs and drives not  just smooth but extra smooth, maybe even more than needed, with stock everything. They say engine could run up to 500k miles (!!!) very durable, decently reliable in terms of you can always crank on and drive , zinced chasis is a plus, sometimes its not very stable on the road in extra sharp maneuvers and extra hard stopping and the angle of turn, stability is not at the very top level but if you drive carefully and obey rules and laws youll be probably good (my relatives like this car very much)

mercury,milan,2006,Hayley, 03/10/2009,Not Exactly Pleased,2,"Loved interior & exterior at purchase. Too bad it didn't last. The window control panel on the driver's side door pops out each time you close the door. I feel like the car is straining when I accelerate. Then when the car had about 25,000 miles on it, it began to hesitate when I tried to accelerate. It got to the point where the car would not respond when I pushed the gas pedal, it would hesitate and then eventually would go, but when it did it would shoot my RPMs up high. This was dangerous, especially in an intersection. The car was under warranty at the time, and they ended up replacing the coil packs (?). This corrected the problem. I'm not impressed with this car & would not recommend."
mercury,milan,2006,Tom, 01/11/2019,What a great car!,5,"We bought this car in 2007 and have had it ever since. Car now has 215K miles on it. Aside from routine maintenance (it has been religiously maintained per the owners manual), we have only repaired the 1) starter and 2) spent about $600 on the supension (both front an rear). Otherwise original engine and everything else, doesn't use oil, has started 100% of the time and ready to go. I cannot believe what a cheap car this has been for us to own. Have had support from 3 different Ford dealerships and have found them all to be amazing. Interior has aged very well, no torn seats, etc. still comfortable to drive. It willl not wow you withits handling (I describe it as a heavy, ponderous car), but engine and acceleration still more powerful than most after all these years, uses no oil at all. Driven in the Midwest winters, very effective traction control. Highly recommended if looking for a cheap and reliable used car. I plan to drive this til it dies, and it shows no signs of doing so!

Its easy to get my down-syndrome uncle in and out. But, the downside is that at about 100,000 miles the transmission will start to slip after driving it about 25-30 minutes, so I can't trust it to pass on the highway.

We have put approximatly 20,000 miles on it already and we havent had any problems. Transmitions fine...Gas mileage is decent, its comfortable and roomy (even with two car seats in back) I have notices one thing though, when I first start it the RPMs run high, but if I give it a second (literaly) they go back down to normal. Certainly the best used car Ive ever had. My husband missed the ""get up and go"" of our 3.9 liter Impala that we had before it, but we have two kids and Im not trying to haul ass around town or anything, so its perfect. I LOVE the side cutain airbags, makes me feel like the kids are safe! Good car thus far!"

The lights on the clock and right visor mirror stopped working and were fixed under warranty. Otherwise, the car has been flawless. The styling and design of the vehicle is very well suited for me and my family. The workmanship and quality are impressive.  We get approximately 24 mpg in our everyday driving which is about half city and half highway. On the interstate with cruise control set at 65 we get 30.5 and with it set at 55 we get 31.5 mpg.  I would buy another one."
mercury,milan,2006,EJJMILAN, 08/06/2008,Still happy 2.5 years in,4,"I have loved my Milan from the start.  I have gotten a lot of compliments on how nice and luxurious it is - it is hard for me to believe it is a moderately priced American car, it is so nice!  I was in an accident where I was rear-ended on the highway - I barely felt the jolt, was perfectly fine - my Milan showed minimal damage - I can't say as much about the economy import that hit me - her car literally crumbled and had to be towed away! I loved the two years of free oil changes that I received!  My only gripe is the brakes aren't that good, and the paint job is not up to snuff. I had to have the roof completely repainted due to rust.  Many chips in the paint on the rest of the body too."
mercury,milan,2006,lawells27, 01/27/2010,Excellent,5,bought new in fall 2005 when they first became available. The lincoln MKZ wasn't out yet so I got the Milan Premier with leather heated seats.

mercury,milan,2006,baugie, 10/25/2005,Milan delivers,4,"Just picked up new Milan last week.  Drove around town and on 5 hour wkend trip, and it didn't disappoint.  Very comfortable seats, smooth quiet ride.  Decent mileage (upper 20s) for driving 80+ mph.   Overall, the style of the Milan is very supple.  From the aggressive front end to the two-toned interior, I feel as though I am in slightly more elegant environment.   It has some flaws such as an audiophile stereo w/out the resonance I would expect.  The interior w/ sunroof is not built for a taller person as I have to adjust my seating (I'm 6'6"").  The engine shifts very quickly from 1st thru 3rd gears.  However, I am very satisifed with the car and hope the reliability holds up."
mercury,milan,2006,Matsupa, 09/24/2006,Milan is Magnificent,4,"We bought the V6 Premier.  The ride is excellent, the only problem with the duratech engine is the torque during a hard acceleration, other than that the shifting of the 6 speed transmission is smooth with more than adequate power.  I have averaged about 25 mpg combined highway and city driving since I have owned the car."
mercury,milan,2006,Steve, 09/18/2006,Milan - Urban Nightmare!,2,"Bought the Milan which supposedly replaces the Sable, three of which I drove for 10 years.  Absolutely no comparison.  The Milan ride, while smooth on highways, is awful on city streets.  You feel every bump and the car shakes on potholes, as if there are no shock absorbers. Urban gas mileage is about 13 mpg, much lower than the Sable.   During summer which a/c on and idling, mpg was 10.  Then there's the wide wheel base which means wide turning circle, a detriment for parking in tight spots or making U turns on city streets. You're paying more for less quality which seems minimally cheap compared to the Sable LS.    "
mercury,milan,2006,BilliardKing, 06/30/2008,Can't Really Complain much.,5,"I really like the style of this car, the outside is really updated! I havn't found a difference between the 2006-2008 models except for the decal on the doors. The grille is an eye catcher, I have had many complements on the car, especially about the color (Gold)  The MPG is acceptable so far it is and avg. of 25 I cant wait to get the window tint darker, that will just top it off!  Im glad I bought it."

My wife is primary driver does a lot of in town driving, so in town mpg's were important she hovers around 27-28 on average. Nice interior, not cluttered & and overly busy, good support on the seats, a main element for my wife. Stylish exterior, much better than the goggle headlight look of its sistership Fusion."

Had toyotas before and besides being very durable and good quiet cars, they are boring. on this Milan there is nothing boring about it, and the sound sistem is great! performances is awesome for a 3.0 and the six speed are feeless, all i can say is i have had the car for 17 days, and its just unbelievable, i can tell when people try to figure out what it is. i recomnd this car wey mlore than a Honda/Toyota!!"
mercury,milan,2006,Deeeeetroit iron, 11/01/2005,Nice for the price,4,"We chose the Milan after testing the Pontiac Grand Prix and G6, DCX 300, Chevrolet Impala, and the Ford 500.  The Milan offered good looks, a quiet ride, great handling, a very nice interior and pretty good gas mileage. For the money, this is the best car (at least from the cars we test drove) hands down.  I would stongly recommend at least a test drive before you settle on something else."
mercury,milan,2006,Cole, 11/01/2005,WOW - Best 2006 Vehicle,5,"This is said to be the same as the Ford Fusion, but if you go and see the vehicles first hand, you will see why this car is best - and they are the same price. This car is heavy, so it feels stable on the road. It rides extremely smooth and it is so quiet, you'll think you're plugging your ears. The front grill and the tail lights make this car stand out from the others, as well as the attractive standard rims. With cloth or leather seats & details, the interior of this car is amazing. The cloth is very soft and comfortable and the leather has attractive stitching. The trunk is large and seats fall down py a push of a button. This is by far the best 2006 vehicle you can buy for the price."
mercury,milan,2006,Rick, 11/07/2005,great running and looking car,5,"Wasn't looking to trade, but got a deal. Vivid Red with all the options.. very comfortable and well made car. Plenty of room. With some reviews that I have seen, seems no matter what Detroit does, it isn't good enough.. If this had a toyota or honda badge, media would have loved it.. Way to go Ford/Mercury.. keep it up!! Defintely a keeper..mileage so far mid 20s.."
mercury,milan,2006,Hans, 11/18/2005,"my new Mercury ""Milan""",4,"Love the Vehicle, Drives well, handles well, good Construction, quiet comfortable Ride. Only Thing strange to me, is the Location if the Brake / Clutch Pedal. Pedals should be further apart. I owned many Std Shift Vehicles, but the Location of the Pedals takes some serious "" Having to get used to it"". Only gripe about this otherwise great Vehicle. Congrats Mercury...Dealership is great. No Problems with Delivery. If the Reliability is as good as my last four Mercury Vehicles....It should be very good.....Just change the Location of those Pedals to make a TRUE Winner."
mercury,milan,2006,T.S., 12/16/2005,a new kind of mercury,4,"I went from a compact truck to this impressive midsized sedan.  I was looking for a Fusion but no dealers were ordering the base model I4 with all the options.  I looked at the milan and found one loaded with everything available.  I test droe it and took it home the same day.  The feel of the vehicle is excellent, interior quality is best in class.  I love the feeling of power shifting through the gears and still getting 29-31 mpg.  The savings alone in gas is worth it to me.  I am a young guy who would have never thought about a Mercury, but this car is fantastic.  I haven't had any problems and don't anticipate any!!!!  If you are looking at any import midsize, you need to see this car."
mercury,milan,2006,TKOlive, 12/28/2005,My New Milan,4,"I just leased a new Milan Premier V6 and so far I love it. I traded in a '03 MINI Cooper, and was spoiled by her pep and manueverability- but I am thrilled with everything so far. The Milan does not take off the moment you accel like a CVT transmission, it does jump a bit and lose a little road control with a harder accelleration.  After less than a second, it does pep up by leaps and bounds...getting on the highway is a breeze. The back window is a little hard to see out of, the brake light blocks the car directly behind you and the rear-view mirror is distorted. Leasing is a great option if you don't want to pay $400 a month for this car. I got $1000 incentive + $500 college grad money."
mercury,milan,2006,jsp, 12/28/2005,06' Premier- loaded,4,"Great car overall.  500 miles and it is quiet, responsive and good looking.  Would like to see more HP.  Did 80+ with no problem. Heated, leather seats were great. driver seat could be softer like my ex-camry.  Very sporty looking, lots of looks from friends. This is a must consider car.  Ford is finally getting it!"
mercury,milan,2006,meinschaft, 02/24/2006,"My New Sable, errr, Milan",4,"I was deciding between a new Civic Si and either a Fusion or Milan.  After driving the Civic Si, I decided it is too small (I commute 140 miles/day).  Leased a Milan Premier with all options except traction control (I wanted it but the dealer could not get me a car with it).  I was prepared to be satisfied but instead have found myself impressed.  The price was the same as the Civic Si, and while Iknow it's comparing apples and oranges, the Milan is really a lot more car for the money.  What really helped make my decisoin was the treatment I received at the Honda dealer - they are old- fashioned leissure-suited liars and thieves.  The Milan is exceptionally quiet and smooth."
mercury,milan,2006,Richard, 08/10/2006,Great car...,4,"I'm quite happy with the new Milan...looks very European and has a sports type ride and handling.  Gas mileage thus far is a bit disappointing for local driving, but highway mileage is excellent.  I bought the upgraded radio but very disappointed in reception...likely due to internal antenna...would have preferred an external antenna and better reception. Build quality seems excellent.  Excellent vehicle for a reasonable price when compared with many of the imports.  Dealership experience was excellent.  I considered Acura, Saab, Honda Accord and Mazda 6 but found that the Milan offered most of the same features for less money.  Dealer let us have for an extended test drive...that sold us!"
mercury,milan,2006,Pat, 05/17/2006,A Real Head Turner,5,"We LOVE THIS CAR!!! It has a look that is truly unique...a cross between a Mercedes and an Italian sports car. The interior is second to none in comfort & has a unique luxurious look. The 17"" extra wide Michelins on 14 spoke wheels look really classy with a very smooth very quite ride. This car drives it self. It handles well in the city and on the highway. It looks like it is moving even when it is parked. The AUDIOPHILE SOUND SYSTEM has superb sound. This car is a real head turner.  Before you buy a new car, you must test drive the Milan. I will say that we first drove the I4 and did not like the sound of the 4 cylinder. The V6 is very quiet and worth the extra cost."
mercury,milan,2006,KeithM, 08/29/2006,Best car I've owned to date,4,"Was planning on an '07, but the 0% financing was too good to resist. Milan Premier has good acceleration (not best in class, but good)Color is Satellite Silver & 2 Tone Charcoal & Tan interior. Test drove(over night) Lincoln Zephyr. Slightly better Leather/Stereo system and THX Navigation system(very nice)just don't add up to a nearly $10K increase in price. Lincoln was quieter and had a ""softer"" suspension. The Milan is definately the ""sportier"" of the 2 cars. I looked at the Ford Fusion. It was nice, but I liked the nicer touches (2 tone leather etc.)that the Milan has. I feel I made a good choice. If the Montego had the 3.5 liter engine (due in '08)Then things might have been different."
mercury,milan,2006,Paul, 09/06/2006,Milan quite the nice car!,5,"I will preface this by saying I work in the retail end of the car business and have for about 25 years. I am an avowed hater of Ford Motor Company vehicles, but I recently went to work as a finance manager for a local Lincoln Mercury dealer. I purchased a new 2005 Milan when I went to work here, and I must say was I ever wrong about Ford cars and trucks. This car is far superior to anything else I have looked at in its class, plus you dont have to pay the brain damage you get from import dealers."
mercury,milan,2006,Matthew, 01/09/2019,06 milan now at 318000 miles,5,"Been a great car. Always dependable. Bought it in 09 with 42000, now have 318000, replaced clutch at 262k. Only recurring problem is brake calipers sticking (rear). Very minimal repairs....mostly normal, ball joints, thermostat, battery, brakes, wheel bearings. Been the best most reliable and still best driving car I ever owned. Would highly recommend for a dependable car.
"
mercury,milan,2006,Greg, 06/01/2010,Had problems,4,"Just after warranty pin on clutch broke and destroyed trans an clutch. Had purchased extra warranty that covered $3180 repair. this happened after 36,000 mile warranty expired. Actually 110 miles after warranty. Now I find pretty common with Fusions and Milan stick shift. Not real happy considering this is supposed to be such a good automobile."
mercury,milan,2006,Paddy, 04/26/2006,Gives the Japanese a run for their money,5,"Our 9 year old Honda Accord got dinged recently in a hit and run, and we finally replaced it with a Mercury Milan Premier V6.  Indians like me have prefered Japanese cars with reliability, and we still have a Nissan Sentra.   This is a beautiful car.  Never mind what the critics say.  It seemed to turn wide, but not after we got used to it.  The Accord was like that initially too.  The drive quality, its smoothness, the pickup with the V6 engine, the trunk space, everything is a smash.  We have a small baby, and we decided to get the side impact air bags as part of the safety package.  It was worth it, given the positive crash test ratings.  Our baby sleeps great in the car."
mercury,milan,2006,dannyboy, 05/06/2008,Vivid Red Milan,4,"This car offers great mpg and a lot of interior space and cargo space. Lots of looks and people ask questions about the car, i.e., what kind of vehicle is this?"
mercury,milan,2006,yven7, 04/13/2010,Not built to last,3,"The car drove well at first with regular maintenance. After the first 100,000 miles there were problems with several hoses connected to the exhaust system and it became much louder. At 142, 000 miles it needs a new transmission and several boards. I trusted the brand after a mercury villager minivan that I drove for more than 260,000 miles but I won't buy another mercury vehicle."
mercury,milan,2006,jr, 10/07/2008,Bought a used Milan,4,"I bought a 2006 Milan in August 2008. The car looks good and is comfortable inside. Road noise on stock tires is too loud on most roads. The ride is harsh with sharp jolts on rough roads.  I thought it would be smoother and quieter than it is. The automatic trans, when manually shifted to a lower gear, shifts into low at 40 mph, quite a jolt. Also the radio, for no reason will increase volume to an uncomfortable level sometimes when I hit the cruise control to decrease the speed. "
mercury,milan,2006,FOMOCO>GM, 03/13/2006,Well worth it!,4,"Have owned this car for a week,so far fantastic is all I can say,As much as I hate to admit it being a GM guy. This is my wife's new car, we finally ditched a 2002 Altima (nothing but problems) Ford did a great job with this car.For my wife it's all about asthetics and this car has it for reasonable money. Many mistake it for a higher end vehicle.The interior is comfortable, well thought out controls, and easy to use. Build quality seems excellent. Nice quiet ride with little road and engine noise. Power is more than adequate for my wife,has some giddy up when you have to pass. The exterior is exceptional,elegant,rich looking without the price. Definitely the adult version of the Fusion. Bravo Ford."
mercury,milan,2006,Paddler, 11/27/2005,The Mercury that could save Ford!,4,"Really the Fusion and the Milan could be the cars that put Ford back on the path to profitability.  The Milan V6 is a pure joy to drive.  Very responsive steering with a good ""on center"" feel.  Nicely appointed.  Smooth shifting 6 speed auto, very reasonable fuel economy (22 mpg around town with AC on). I prefer the 16"" wheels as they give the car a better ride than the lower profile 17"" wheels.   Would I buy this car again, no hesitation, Yes!"
mercury,milan,2006,hello, 11/17/2006,Very nice car,4,The first gear is a little short.  Lots of power and lots of extras.  Very nice styling and lots of leg room.  
mercury,milan,2006,tim, 02/26/2009,Very happy with my purchase,4,The only thing that bothers me is the engine noise but it's a 4 cyl 5 speed. It's a fun car to drive and the features that come with the car is perfect for what I and any one else needs that drives a lot. 
mercury,milan,2006,Love My Car, 12/31/2005,Milan,4,A beautiful car to look at but even more fun to drive.  The car is comfortable with plenty of room for all passengers. Luxury both inside and out.  Love the look and lay out of the dashboard.  Very quiet and smooth ride.  Luxury car for a reasonable price.  A pleasure to drive!!!
mercury,milan,2006,Larry Klassen, 01/06/2006,Better than expected,4,"I've driven my Milan Premier V-6 over 3500 miles and I like it more everytime I drive it.  It's quiet, very comfortable, fast, has excellent brakes and the handling is superior.  Last round trip from San Diego to Phoenix I averaged 25.8 mpg driving 75 mph. (it's legal in I-8 east of Yuma) That average includes driving around Phoenix for four days too.  So far my Milan has met or exceeded every expectation.  The great looks are a bonus. I've received more enthusiastic comments about this car than on anything I've ever owned."
mercury,milan,2006,06 Premier Loaded, 01/18/2006,Love this car - 06 Premier Loaded,5,Bought this car end of December 2005. Luxurious & comfortable.  So far averaging 32 miles per gallon...which is pretty good.   I get a lot of looks and a lot of heads turning just to get a look at the new car.  Probably the nicest car I've ever driven.  It's been a very dependable car so far...plus it is fun to drive.   I did not like the look of the Ford Fusion at all....the trim and features on the Milan Premier make this a fabulous car!  
mercury,milan,2006,Harold, 01/20/2006,Best looking design in years,4,"For my money this is the best looking car produced by FLM in years. What captured both my wife and myself was how clean it looks on the inside. I got a Premier with an automatic and loads of options for $22k with a 4 cyl. engine. The ride is very comfortable and quiet. If the price of gas ever comes down I would suggest the 6 cyl. engine as that would provide some needed power but after owning a 6 and getting terrible gas mileage during the summer in San Antonio, A/C season is from March- November, the 4 fits me just fine. Only had the car a week, will return with more info after I've driven it a few thousand miles."
mercury,milan,2006,T's Mercury , 01/19/2006,Isthis really a Mercury,5,I really like my new Mercury i get plenty of complements on it to people say they really like it and i like the smooth ride and it handles great and i like the unique taillamps plus there LED which look great and there really bright and i love the all black interior with that white stitching looks great as well and i like the wales mohogany wood trim i just like everything about the car it looks absolutely great and people stop and look at it and look at it going down the road i think Mercury has done a great job
mercury,milan,2006,mercury milan, 01/23/2006,Mercury has our ATTENTION,5,"The vehicle is quiet, well constructed, I am very happy with the acceleration, the dash is set up nicely, I would like a little more head room , and i am only 5 ft 10inches, fuel regular and the mpg  is circa 30 on the hwy."
mercury,milan,2006,Hans, 01/26/2006,Wrote to you before,4,"I sent my Review to you before. The Milan is an excellent Vehicle...period. One Suggestion, other than the Pedal Location (Clutch/Brake) I like to suggest to show your ""Milan"" in "" Vivid Red Clearcoat Metallic"" Exterior with a Camel Cloth Interior, since you are trying to attract a younger Buyer, Ford is doing it with their ""Fusion""."
mercury,milan,2006,dd, 02/01/2006,best mercury yet,5,"I picked up my Milan this week with all the options.  It's a great sedan --  very comfortable, sound system rocks, seems very well built with a great solid design."
mercury,milan,2006,Denise, 02/26/2006,Mercury Milan,4,"Love this car.Owned a Lincoln,& Grand Marquis,can't compare for fun and sport.Also had Mustangs,this is as much a car as the Mustangs with a better price tag.Its about time Mercury came out with a nice sporty good looking car.Really loving the gas mileage!I bought this carfor myself,however my husband is always driving it. It has more room inside than it looks,very,very happy with this car.I hope Mercury continues to design attractive sporty cars.The grill looks like the car is growling,and it does on the highways.But,I may be sticking with this baby."
mercury,milan,2006,Mechanic, 02/27/2006,They Got It Right Car!,5,"This I-4 AT Mercury Milan Runs, Handles & Stops Excellently! The build quality is what it should be, with body parts that line up and are tight. The Milan was delivered with the Premier Package & has every feature that one could ever want. (Tilt/ Telescopic steering, 6 CD AM/FM MP/3 Radio, Multi Tone Leather Interior, Power Driver Seat, 17""Aluminum Wheels, Air Bags Front & Side, 4 Wheel Independent Suspension, 4 Wheel Dics Brakes With AntiLock, NiceLookingClock, 5Speed Automatic Trans, PuddleLights, Alarm,Stainless Exhaust System). Real world MPG has been as high as 35 on the highway and not lower than 30.2. City is usually between 20.7 & 23 although the latest cold weather stop & go was 18.7. "
mercury,milan,2006,Lindsay, 03/09/2006,This is a pretty sweet car,4,"I have only owned this vehicle for one month, but it is better than all the other cars I have owned combined. "
mercury,milan,2006,Gerald, 03/14/2006,Like Butter!,5,"We love this Milan Premier. With heated leather seats, sun roof and plenty of comfort room in the front/rear seats. We drove the Toyota Camry for 1 week prior to purchasing the Milan...the Mercury is superior in quietness and fit, finish and interior trim and instrument dislay to the Toyota. Lot's of pride driving an American brand with curb appeal!  "
mercury,milan,2006,Milan Lover, 03/26/2006,I LOVE my Milan!,5,"I've had my Milan almost two months and I LOVE it!  We got the one with all the bells and whistles.  It handles well, gets good mileage, and looks like an expensive European model.  People have stopped to ask me what it is.  Most people comment on the two-toned, stitched leather seating and the mahogny trim.  I personally am in love with the grille."
mercury,milan,2006,Judy, 03/28/2006,I love it!!!!,4,"Best new little car I have ever had. smooth ride, peppy, sleek and fun to drive."
mercury,milan,2006,Rick, 04/09/2006,Is this really an American car,5,"The Milan I purchased is a Premier which comes with leather and numerous amenities and options including side air bags, a convenience pkg, heated front seats and traction contol.  For the price this car is a steal.  It seems inevitable that the Milan/Fusion will change the public's perception of American sedans.   "
mercury,milan,2006,CHRISM13, 04/09/2006,Best In Class By Chris,5,"After driving the Honda, Toyota and the Milan, I said to myself the ford motor company is back. The Lincoln Mercurys where getting old and although they where nice cars there was something missing and has been found in the Milan ,Montego,Mariner and the Zphyr. When buying the milan the sales person said I will go to any dealer you want and go head to head and I said lets go, and it was great to see that this vehicle has it all over the other vehicles in the market place even the sister fusion for stand equipment and style. To whomever looking do not count this vehicle out you will only hurt your self in the long run."
mercury,milan,2006,Matt R., 04/11/2006,Better Than I Expected,4,"Just bought my black V6 Premier with all the options yesterday.  The interior is very classy and you do not feel like you're sitting in a 20- somthing thousand dollar car.  It feels like you're riding on smooth glass, even on the gravel/oil roads in my area.  Compared to my '02 Focus w/ 86K, the Focus drives like a shopping cart.  It had come down to the Milan, Sonata, Accord and Camry.  The Milan may not be the fastest or have all the gagets, but I beats all of these in ride quality and most of all looks.  Don't get me wrong, I thought engine performance was the most important thing, but just driving it home I realized I just wanted to drive it nice and easy enjoying the ride.  "
mercury,milan,2006,eric, 05/05/2006,nice looking car but it can be better,3,"We bought a black V6 permier milan and drove it from Florida to Washington DC.  No problem.  The ride was fine.  The rearview visibility is not very good.  The car is very stylish from outside but if Mercury wants to compete Milan with Japanese and European cars, it needs to make further improvements to the interior design.  For expamples, the a/c vents look cheap.  The markings  on them look tacky.  They should just leave them blank.  The marking (unlock) on the door handles also make them look cheap.  Leave them blank.  The trunk is roomy but the linning is poor.  There are some exposed metals in the trunk.  The carpet in the trunk is sloppy. Small details can really make a big difference."
mercury,milan,2006,Heather, 05/19/2006,I love this car!,4,"This is the first new car I have ever bought and I absolutely love it. I considered the Camry or the Altima, but the styling of the Milan really caught me. Plus I really wanted to buy American... so I did. I have been very pleased with the car so far.  "
mercury,milan,2006,pete, 06/19/2006,my milan,3,my milan is fun and quick. i like to drive it everybody tells me how nice and sporty it is. i always liked the mercury grandmarquis but the price of gas turned me away and when mercury came out with the milan i had to have it and it was very affordable. i had the car about three month and i am very happy with it.
mercury,milan,2006,2Crisco, 07/08/2006,Happy I did not buy the Camry!,5,"It was between the Milan and the Toyota Camry for me and all I can say is I am so happy I bought the Milan!  I was driving a 6 cyl '95 Mustang for 11 years and swore I would never buy another 4 cyl - but I am amazed by the power this car has!  The Premier has so many bells and whistles that I don't think I've found them all in my 6 short days of ownership! I have not yet gone through my first full tank of gas, it seems the gauge barely moves!  Not used to this kind of mileage! When every other car on the road is a Camry, driving my Milan is like my little secret!  This is a great car!"
mercury,milan,2006,Mark, 07/12/2006,American car revival,5,"I am leasing this car over a Saab 9-3 or Camry/Accord or other mid size sedan. Test drove the Saab, like the ride and road noise better in the Milan. Surprisingly fit and finish is better in the Milan. Final judgement, pound for pound the best mid size car 24,000 can buy. (Most bang for the buck)."
mercury,milan,2006,Sailor, 07/22/2006,Lots of Mileage,4,"I have had my Milan for 9 months and have put on 37,000 miles. No problems but even the dealer does not have brake pads in stock yet.  The lumbar in the drivers seat broke but other than that, I love the car and will be trading her in for another in a year or so."
mercury,milan,2006,A.P.M, 08/04/2006,I love my Mercury Milan,5,"I've only had this milan for a couple of months and i really like it. I was very nervous about buying it because I've always owned a honda accord and I will say this mercury milan gives the accord a run for its money. I am so happy I bought it. It really goes so smooth in town and on highway. Im very glad I had an open mind and tried something new the ""Mercury Milan""."
mercury,milan,2006,Jessica, 08/22/2006,My Milan Rocks,4,I love the Mercury Milan because the car is stylish and affordable. I like the sedans and don't want to drive a mom car. This car is comfortable and is quick!
mercury,milan,2006,Hans, 11/23/2005,"My new ""Milan""",5,"Great Car....great Looks, very good Built, handling terrific. very powerful for a 4 cylinder Engine. Love the Std. Transmission. Only Complaint. Brake and Clutch Pedal too close together, sometimes I hit both Pedals....Change that and you a really terrific Automobile "
mercury,milan,2006,AUBURN MATT, 11/23/2005,Excellent Car for not a lot of Money,5,"I've been waiting on the Ford Fusion to come out.  This Mercury however was the first one in Houston that was optioned (not loaded up) the way I wanted.  I'm glad I bought the Mercury as the car is great inside and out.  Plenty of room for me (I'm 6'3"") to drive and the kids still have leg room in the back.  With incentives I paid less than $17.5K.  Can't rate reliability until something occurs but the car runs great right now.  If I had the patience I might have waited on Ford/Mercury to deliver a manual Transmission with Leather Interior.  As it is I am plenty happy with the car and hope that maybe this means there will be a resurgence at Ford to deliver great trucks and cars."
mercury,milan,2006,Love my Milan, 01/13/2006,Beautiful Car!,4,"Just purchased a Milan Premier 4 cyl, 5spd manual.  It was a special order. I love the way the car handles and the sound of the engine as I shift.  Mine is Medium Charcoal, which is a beautiful color with the two tone, Medium Charcoal and Stone leather interior.  I was concerned about the smaller engine, but with the manual transmission, seems to have plenty of power.  So far gas mileage is average 21, but not broken in yet.  I have had lots of compliments on this vehicle.  Come on Ford/Mercury you just need to market this to sell.  Once someone sees the car up close and drives it, it would be hard not to be in love with this car."
mercury,milan,2006,plvns, 01/14/2006,Mercury Finally Matches Competitors,4,"A huge value.  While this car won't stand out as in any one category, the overall value is tops.  A real competitor to Camry, Accord, and Mazda 6.  The 17 inch tires and the suspension/steering setup is a nice compromise between Asian car ""go cart"" suspension feel and heavier German counterparts.  Nice dash design, and the exterior styling is sweet.  Great in the city and on long trips."
mercury,milan,2006,Kristin, 01/15/2006,My New Milan,5,"I love my Milan! My husband recently turned in his leased truck, and decided to surprise me with the Milan. When it comes to running errands, it's always a toss up as to who drives, we both want to drive .... so we try to compromise."
mercury,milan,2006,CJ, 01/15/2006,Finally...a car done right,5,"We purchased a 2006 Milan Premier after considering the typical Honda and Toyota models.  Milan is a standout for the money.  The styling is fresh and the interior is first rate.  Leather seating is very comfortable, and room is amazing against typical cars in this class. Milan is a fun to drive car, with controlled handling over a number of road conditions.  It just seems sure footed.  Point it and it follows.  The Audiophile sound system renders CD's well, and delivers better sound than most OEM systems.  I wish, however, Ford/Mercury would again revert to the JBL or Harman sound systems.  It's nice to have a label attached to a premium system.  We love this car."
mercury,milan,2006,milaning, 02/01/2006,Lovin' it,4,"This car is by far one of the BEST values in the mid-size car segment. Forget Honda Forget Toyota!!! nice cars but WAY over rated. I drove the new accord (had a 00 accord ex) and the 06 Toyota. Great point A to B cars but if you want to LOVE being in the drivers seat you have to test drive this car!!! If you do, I bet you will buy it!!!"
mercury,milan,2006,Hypercrew, 02/20/2006,Mercury,4,"When I found the car online, I thought, there is no way this is a Mercury.  Looking for a European sedan, I was very happy to find this styling and performance in an American car, all at a very good price.  People have told me they thought I was driving a BMW or a VW Passat, both of which are taken as compliments."
mercury,milan,2006,Carolyn, 02/21/2006,Very comfortable,4,I am very pleased so far with the vehicle.  It is made well and drives nice.  It is stylish with plenty of interior room. Elegant look inside and out.
mercury,milan,2006,Bob, 02/20/2006,Milan V6 Premier,5,Great Mid-Size car to buy.  Very Pleased with the handling and overall performance.
mercury,milan,2006,eric, 02/22/2006,Great new car,5,"This is the best car i've been in, in its class. Beautiful in and out. Smooth ride, handling, and very comfortable."
mercury,milan,2006,Rick Wheeler, 03/08/2006,Milan review,4,"I like the features that come with the car as well as the price tag. Most bang for your buck. Styling is nice, ride is smooth and gas mileage is great."
mercury,milan,2006,Jordan , 03/22/2006,Me and My Wife Love It,5,Me and my wife recently purchased a 2006 Mercury Milan Premier V6 after looking at the Lincoln Zephyr and Ford Fusion and to us the Milan was the Best For the money it has the best looking exterior out of the three and i like the the all black leather interior with the nice looking wood grain accents and the 221 HP V6 is speedy and gets great gas mileage and the interior is also quite roomy although headroom could be better and the trunk is a good size and i like the bright LED taillights and the Sleek Front Design and to me this is the best car in the midsize car segment and by far the best for the money so i highly reccommend the Mercury Milan because its great 
mercury,milan,2006,Denise Brescia, 04/01/2006,Very sporty & rich feeling,5,I have been leasing the Cougar since 2000. This was my first 4 door car. I thought I would feel old and bored driving it. I have to say though I was so surprised how sporty & sleek it feels! I went with red to mix it up a bit and I love it! I get looks everywhere I go! The drive is smooth and the inside & out is sharp as can be! I'm hoping Mercury comes out with a convertible of the Milan! Good job Mercury!!!
mercury,milan,2006,joe, 04/04/2006,'06 Milan a hit with me!,5,Just picked up my new Milan and what a pleasure.  The car feels rock solid on the road and is wisper quiet on the inside.  You can actulally have a conversation at speed and not have to talk louder than usual.  
mercury,milan,2006,DJ, 04/15/2006,What a car!!,4,"I was thinking about buying a used Audi, but by chance we came across Milan.  We went to dealership to check it out.  As soon as we saw it and checked the interior, we knew it was it.  The car is stylish, loaded with features, and great price.  It drives like a sports car, and feels like a luxury car.  Worth every penny!!"
mercury,milan,2006,Bob, 04/28/2006,Looks Like A Winner,4,"Just picked up my new Milan last week and am well pleased so far.  Good build quality and fun to drive.  Last car was a Honda Accord, so my expectations were high.  Ford did not disappoint.  Much quieter interior than Honda and well- mannered on the road.  If they keep building cars like this, Americans will buy.  "
mercury,milan,2006,Sara Youngblood, 05/28/2006,Love my Milan,5,"The Milan is a very well-built sedan.  It has all the most important features, like power windows, locks, 6 way power seat, remote keyless entry.  An excellent radio, mp3, cd and speakers.  A tilt/telescopic steering wheel with cruise and volume control.  The gas mileage for in town is good.  The air conditioning is exceptional.  It really keeps the car nice and cool.  I really like the message center where you can get information on you oil pressure, doors closed or open, brake fluid, are just a few of the items. It's loads of fun to drive and has more power than I expected for a 4 cylinder engine.  I'm very very happy with my milan.  Also the price for the car is very afforadable."
mercury,milan,2006,Scott Gurholt, 06/13/2006,Ford Brings Europe to U.S. Autos,5,"The Milan is what Ford has been waiting for. It blends the best of European design, Japanese ingenuity with American quality and attention to detail. Finally an American auto manufacturer shows the benefit of what multi-national auto brand ownership brings.  The ride is tight, yet smooth. The interior sounds is silent. The 6-speed auto transmission takes a little getting used to, but one you do it's great and the extra mileage you gain is very much welcome these days.  The car also looks sharp. It reminds me of the old Alfa 164 - edgy for its time. The Milan finally gives some style to an American sedan. GM should take note ... "
mercury,milan,2006,Mexidutch29, 06/27/2006,Great Car,5,"Have had for a little over 2 months and 6 thousand miles.  Very happy.  Tight body, tight ride.  Milan is dressier that the fusion.  Mine has the platinum trim interior which is nicer that the fake wood interior shown.  Have gotten over 30 miles to galllon on highway."
mercury,milan,2006,Kim, 06/25/2006,Love it!,4,"This car replaced a Plymouth Breeze, which had something major wrong annually. I've had this for 3 months with many miles on it, and not a single thing has gone wrong. I have some quibbles about some of the interior features (no digital clock; no gear display above steering wheel, only near the shift), but this is overall the nicest car I've ever owned."
mercury,milan,2006,Steve, 06/28/2006,Great car for the money!,4,"I considered a 2007 Camry XLE but one with the options I wanted was not available anywhere so I looked at the Milan.  It doesn't have as many bells and whistles as the Camry (Bluetooth- enabled JBL stereo, dual-zone climate control, power passenger seat, etc.), but I like the interior styling better and have gotten many comments on the car's good looks.  It looks like a more expensive car than it is and has a great ride to it while being fun to drive."
mercury,milan,2006,Gary Senecal, 07/28/2006,Car of the year,4,The style of this car caught my eye as soon as it came out. It is made extremely well.  Very sound and tight. This car definitely turns heads.  I am sure it will be an award winner.  The only draw back is its slower than average pick up. but I'am retired and not in a hurry.
mercury,milan,2006,Jim Mueller, 07/30/2006,An Awesome American Car,5,"I am leasing a 4 cylinder automatic. I thought performance might be doggy with the ""four"" but I am blown away by the great acceleration and crisp handling. The ride quality is comfortable and quiet. The standard music system is excellent. The trip computer is very usefull. Plus there's lots of compartments and ""cubby-holes"". There's plenty of room for a 6'-4"" dude like me. The lease deal I got was an incredible value. I highly recommend the Milan!"
mercury,milan,2006,Rick, 08/12/2006,Finally--an competitive American sedan,4,"We have had the Milan for 5 months so the new has worn off a little and we are now seeing past the glitter of a new car.  I have looked for flaws in the paint, fit or anything else.  There are none.  The car has no flaws.  I have no complaints.  The fuel mileage around town is usually in the 24-25 mpg range and the highway mileage is usually 29+."
mercury,milan,2006,Oshkosh49, 08/14/2006,Excellent alternative to Japanese models,4,"This car is just a fantastic choice. I love this car. I've had nothing but a very excellent experience owning this car since March. Absolutely zero quality issues. It rides like silk. It handles and looks like a more expensive European sports sedan. The combonation of the 6-speed automatic and the 3.0 liter 221HP V6 provides excellent acceleration. Especially anything over 35 MPH. The interior with the comfortable two-tone leather seating and the wood-grained dash gives it a look of a higher end European model. And for a similarly equipped Camry, Altima, or Accord, you'll pay more, lots more in some cases. There is no better midsize car for the money than the V6 Mercury Milan Premier.    "
mercury,milan,2006,Jayme, 08/29/2006,Looks so Luxury!,5,"I was reviewing many cars in this class (accord, fusion, g6, etc.) and this by far was the best in design, style and performance. I'm so impressed at the style of the interior. It's very classic and upscale and reminds me of the old Mercedes appeal. I purchased this car after I'd had a lexus for 3 years and I can honestly say the drive and style was no more impressive than my Milan!: )"
mercury,milan,2006,Tom Eberhart, 09/07/2006,Milan Review,3,"No acceleration, but cruises at seventy very smoothly and quietly.  Handles very nicely. The exterior door mirrors are very large and get bumped a lot."
mercury,milan,2006,LJDunham, 09/07/2006,Love the Features,4,"I owned an Altima; and LOVED it - 2002. Got great trade in value in MA where we lived before. Loved the style and the inside features-like a Lincoln. Do not know 3.0 mileage,but it is really smooth and drives, handles like a charm. To compare to 2007 cars out it is better look and drive. Pricing higher on Premier, but do feel the sun-roof,CD, and other opions are a must for me. Love the paint color-changes in the sun/shade. All leather-all comfort."
mercury,milan,2006,Paul, 09/06/2006,New to Mercury Milan,4,"We just purchased a 2006 Milan. At this time, we are  pleased with the overall mechanical performance of the vehicle. She is roomy, comfy, peppy (4cyl), and artfully beautiful inside and out as well as feeling solid and responsive. She suits our needs and we have been content with Mercury vehicles having owned a 1994 Villager and a 1989 Marquis that was sold to a family member. There will be complaints about the 4cyl not being w/o more HP but then they need to be driving the auto of their choice and budget. We can't wait to do a road trip in our Milan. We will let you know how that succeeds. PL"
mercury,milan,2006,TKOlive, 09/09/2006,My Milan after 9 months,4,"I've had my Milan for 9 months now.  I still am in love with it. My husband begs to drive it. I think he loves it more than I do! This is a large car (to me at least) but it still handles well and brakes wonderfully. Two problems I've had are the lumbar support blew out and had to be replaced, and both visors pop out of joint when you fold them down. Other things I've noticed are a very wide turn, loses a bit of road control if you accellerate out of a turn too quickly."
mercury,milan,2006,markw45, 09/14/2006,"Great car, not your cookie cutter mobile",4,"Not too many miles just yet but so far so good.  Very unique car.  I haven't seen another pass me by yet.  I have seen the Fusion around though.  2 people I work with prefer it to their new vehicles ( one a chrysler 300 and one a Camry )  Nice leather interior, good dash layout."
mercury,milan,2006,Frank, 09/20/2006,2006 Milan Premier - Great Car,4,"The car is a great looking car and handles very well on the road.  The V6 has enough power to pass just about everything on the highway.  Love the entire - unique but classy.  No issues or problems after 19,000 miles. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone.  "
mercury,milan,2006,ron w, 09/27/2006,"Owner of Milan, 5,000 mile review",4,"The outside raised saddle on the front seat creates excessive exterior left thigh pressure when sitting for 8-12 hours traveling accross country. I weigh 200# and I think the seat is to constraining. My '04 Sable leather seat was more comfortable and should have been a design benchmark. The cruise control, radio control and heater control on steering wheel are too small requiring to observe when setting. The size of the '04 Sable steering wheel controls were excelant. The lock/unlock controls on the key fob should be larger. In the dark, confusing which is which. The '04 Sable should have been bench marked. The remote trunk lid should pop the trunk open and not just a release. "
mercury,milan,2006,Rick, 09/28/2006,I never thought I would buy a Mercury,5,"I was looking for a Fusion when the 0% for 72 months was running and stumbled upon a Milan. I think its better looking and so far it's been a very pleasurable experience. All city driving so far and each tank full has been better mileage, the last one went 374 miles on 16.1 gallons. It will be interesting to get a tank thru it on the highway to see how close I can get to the 29 mpg. Quiet, very roomy and comfortable even for a 6'6"" driver. The controls on the steering wheel make the radio, cruise and a/c controls a breeze, altho the temp control is on the lower right and I rest my thumb in that area when I drive--sometimes the temp gets bumped up to 80 degrees! "
mercury,milan,2006,Howard, 10/08/2006,Most bang for the buck,5,"I went to the Detroit Auto Show to pick up a discount coupon for Mercury Montego but fell for the Milan instead, and bought one identical to the one on display at the auto show.  In terms of value for dollars spent this is the best car I've ever owned.  For the last 10 years I've felt that Ford (and GM) have tried to sell the least car for the most money.  With the Milan I feel Ford has turned a corner.  The Milan is loaded with standard features and useful optional features, very solidly built, classy inside and out.  The six-speed transmission is smooth and acceleration is powerful when I need it to be.  More than that the car is well thought out in virtually every way.  "
mercury,milan,2006,Very Pleased, 10/13/2006,A Lot of Car for the Money,5,"Fully loaded, the car has all of the bells and whistles you'll ever need and then some. Very responsive engine and tight, quiet ride make it fun to drive. I've been amazed at the gas mileage since I've just logged 1,000 miles on the engine."
mercury,milan,2006,LM, 11/21/2006,Awesome Buy,5,"one of the best car purchases i have made yet, milan looks good inside and out, also handles well on roads, would recommend for anyone in the market for a new car."
mercury,milan,2006,souvicity, 11/22/2006,Nice Combination of Class & Performance,4,"The size is just right for 4 comfortably, 5 if necessary. Features are as plentiful as my previous Lincoln with the ride quality being different than the Continental; tighter ride but less plush. Great acceleration when needed, decent mileage around town. Carries an 8' ladder in the trunk by lowering the back seat. A very convenient feature. Although looks are very subjective, it receives many compliments. "
mercury,milan,2006,Kevin, 11/27/2006,Mercury got it right,4,"Putting this car on the excellent Mazda platform and then designing it like a European car sold me. I looked at the Zephyr and the  Fusion and this was easily the best designed. The interior is elegant and the two tone seats are very cool. The sheet metal competes with far more expensive vehicles. The six speed is smooth, and the V-6 has all the pep I need. And it has just the right amount of gizmos; you're not  overwhelmed. Great car, especially for  the price."
mercury,milan,2006,Rene Blais, 12/03/2006,Great buy. sporty and fun to drive!,5,This is my 1st Mercury and I'm glad I test drove it because I love it. Great car excellent gas mileage and more.
mercury,milan,2006,Anon, 12/17/2006,Nice car. Surprising little gem,5,"Diamond in the rough!!!  People that would never consider this car don't know what they are missing.  The Mercury brand is revitalizing itself and aiming towards a younger crowd with crisp design and affordable luxury.  The work-horse Duratech engine has had years of tweaking with the Taurus/Sable, so, of course the car has great performance and will be reliable in the long term. Sport package actually makes car look sporty and not cheesy like other sedans. Love the tail-lights and fold-down rear seat feature.  I feel proud driving this fun little car.  The perception that imports are always a better product is just that, a perception.  Try American, guys.  "
mercury,milan,2006,c.h., 12/22/2006,great car,4,the milan is a great car with lots of features of a luxury car and very roomy comfortably fits five a very roomy trunk. powerful for a for cylinder fun to drive great tranny five speeds does great in the mountains downshifts going up great in drive i don't even see why they  have a low gear on this car it does awesome in drive eatc climate control is nice you just set it and forget it overall i'm very happy with this car i would buy another in the blink of an eye
mercury,milan,2006,Bruce in Texas, 01/04/2007,Pleasantly Surprised,4,"Went out on a limb and bought a Mercury...loved the looks and got zero per cent, but was nervous about the purchase, but getting more pleased each month.  Went from LS400 to Accord EXV6 to F150 and now Milan.  Fun to drive, quiet, comfortable and I'm a big guy, but I've still got head room.  Also don't see many on the road, which I like, and its way cooler than a Fusion, but 3k less than Accord.  Got one of the last 2006s and wish I'd gotten the audiophile system.  Rides and feels like the Accord.  Had it four months, 4200 miles and only one small rattle to get checked.  Mileage is about 20mpg town, and 25 highway...expected a bit more.  Trunk easily holds golf clubs. Great looking car!"
mercury,milan,2006,Jodi, 01/03/2007,My Best Car Ever,4,"From the beginning I have loved this car.  It is my first Ford, normally I drive GM, and I couldn't be more impressed with my Ford. My Milan drives so nice and I get compliments on it all the time. I will continue to purchase Ford and I will do it at the same dealership. They were wonderful. "
mercury,milan,2006,KJK, 01/05/2007,Great car for the money,5,"After leaving an 04 BMW 325 I was a little concerned about performance, I was told by many that since it is made in part by Mazda, I was willing to take a chance, Now after 5 months of driving this car, I find it to be a great value for its selling price. It may not have the torque of the Beemer, but once driving on the highway, the handling, feel and overall comfort are that of a very high end car with the price tag of under $25,000. People are forever asking me what if is since it has the look of a high end Italian car. Every morning when I get in my Milan, I smile knowing that my payments are half what I had paid for my higher end cars yet it rides as well."
mercury,milan,2006,M Snyder, 01/21/2007,A Excellent all around Automobile,5,I have owned this car for 9 months and have 9000 miles on it now. It hasn't had one single problem. It handles and rides great. It has all the power and braking ability one ever could ask for.I love this car.
mercury,milan,2006,samson126, 02/01/2007,Good vehicle,4,"Took advantage of year end pricing and financing and not disappointed.  Nice family car. If you are looking to save some money by getting the base model of a brand, this model shouldn't disappoint. Took awhile to get used to 4 cylinder after driving 6 cylinder, but after 5 months the car is dependable and gets me from point A to B without any worries.  It looks like a more expensive model and so far is very dependable. "
mercury,milan,2006,Mark, 02/10/2007,Milan is a very competitive car,4,"My 2002 Neon was paid off for 8 months and I was happy not having a car payment, but I bit on the 0% financing and am not looking back.   I knew this would be a car I keep at least 5-7 years so I wanted to make sure I can pick every feature I possibly can, as well as make sure it will be a car I that will age well.  I test drove a few cars and felt the Milan was the best choice, as well as best bang for the buck.  The car is very stylish, and I enjoy the ride.  I have the Premier package and love all the features (heated seats, auto dimming mirror).  It's a great car all around.  Ford has its act together when it comes to the Fusion/Milan.  You owe it to yourself to at least test drive one."
mercury,milan,2006,Kirk S, 02/14/2007,Gotta have Milan,4,Wonderful car.  Comfortable and fun to drive.  Everyone loves the interior and exterior style.  Highly recommend. Looked at Camry and Accord.  The Mercury dealer was willing to deal.
mercury,milan,2006,lucky46, 02/16/2007,Green beauty,4,"Fun to drive, fantastic handling.  Bought the 4 cylinder for fuel economy.  It has adequate zip.  I got 34 mpg on a long highway trip through PA.  Quieter than my 2003 Sable, handles like a smaller car, very maneuverable and yet with a very comfortable ride and more than adequate interior space.  I am 6 foot 4 and I love the telescoping steering wheel."
mercury,milan,2006,Falina, 04/14/2007,After the Accident,5,"I was recently in an accident in my new Milan and I was impressed with the overall safety of the car. My two year old son and I walked away, but my Milan suffered more damage as they started to repair the front end of the car. I would recommend the Milan again and again for safety plus I love the two tone leather interior, sound system, and sporty look.  And the best part is the value for the price. Very good. "
mercury,milan,2006,dar2855, 03/29/2007,Love it,4,"This is a great car for the money. I put 24,000 miles on in 11 months and no problems. The 4 cylinder has good performance and 33 miles per gallon. Wish they had the AWD when I bought mine."
mercury,milan,2006,RevRev, 07/04/2007,Best Car I've Ever Owned!,5,"After nearly one year, I don't hesitate claiming that the Milan is the best car I've ever owned. My wife, who loves her minivan, prefers to take my Milan whenever she gets a chance because of how fun it is to drive. I've driven a lot of cars, and the Milan looks, feels, and most importantly drives like a lot more expensive car. Kudos to the engineers at Ford/Mazda for developing a winner here!"
mercury,milan,2006,Froglet20, 07/20/2007,My Milan,5,I've had this car for almost a year now and I think it's wonderful.  
mercury,milan,2006,cheryl, 11/24/2007,Mercury Milan,5,I fell in love with this car when I saw the commercials.  It is an awesome car with few issues regarding warranty.  The brake issues were fixed immediately.  All in all the car itself is top of the line.
mercury,milan,2007,milanI4auto, 12/13/2006,Milan I4 Automatic,5,"Love this car. I selected the Milan over Fusion (Milan has a better looking interior and exterior), G6 and Accord (Milan has better seating position of short drivers like my wife) before making purchasing decision.  Drove this car almost 1000 mile to SC after owning it for a month. Ride was smooth and quiet. Must have the most trunk space of mid-sized sedans.   Fuel economy is good, but not great for a 4 cylinder. Does have a 17.5 gallon tank that provides an incredible driving range.  What amazes me is that you see so few on the road given our experience."
mercury,milan,2007,scwalburn, 11/25/2006,2007 Milan I4 Auto,5,"What a pleasant surprise.  Roomy, even for me at 6'5"".  Feels like a much bigger car. Quiet and responsive, smooth shifting and all for $18,000. Way to go Ford!"
mercury,milan,2007,SpiceUmUp, 11/23/2006,7800 Miles and no complaints and a few t,4,"I now have 7800 mile on the car since September and I am pleased as can be.  With an average speed of 50+ miles per hour I am averaging 24.5 miles to the gallon, better than I anticipated.  Nothing on the car has failed to function perfectly every time.  I discovered the car does have an exterior temperature display: there is a little button on the climate control that says EXT.  Push that and you have outside temperature displayed instead of the set point of the climate control.  If you adjust the temperature setting, it switches back to exterior temp as soon as you are done.  Nicely done but it could be a little easier to find and the owners manual could spell it out a little better"
mercury,milan,2007,Barry, 12/14/2006,Excellent refined automobile,5,"Great acceleration for a 4 cylinder engine.  Styling is very impressive, looks better than vehicles that cost a lot more.  Interior is very comfortable.  Premier model has lots of desired extras.  Handling is superb!  Very good gas mileage.  Ford/Mercury has a real winner here!"
mercury,milan,2007,Clare, 12/23/2006,I love this car,5,"I traded in my 2000 Nissan Maxima for the Milan. I have had the car for a little over a week and am really impressed with the quality and tight feel. It is quiet and very comfortable. It runs smoothly and I am looking forward to the winter snows to feel the improved control with AWD.In a few years,I plan on handing this car over to my teenage son who loves to snowboard. I feel comfortable that I will be giving him a safe car. "
mercury,milan,2007,SpiceUmUp, 09/03/2006,I thought I would miss the Chrysler 300,4,"I picked this car up just three days ago and I already am sold on it.  It rides very well though I feel the expansion joints more than in the 300.  the seat are very comfortable, the controls are where they should be and working them is intuitive.  The climate controls are set too low in the dash but the steering wheel mounted controls make that mostly a non-issue.  The engine has plenty of power and when you whomp the Go-Pedal, it GOES. It is VERY quiet inside with little road noise & little engine noise until you really nail the accelerator.  This is good because the sounds system is great.  6 disc CD with MP3 capability and 8 speaks.  The open moon roof has very little wind noise"
mercury,milan,2007,Tim H., 11/21/2015,Exactly what you'd expect.,4,"We've had the car for a short time now and its been exactly what I've expected it to be. The car has great handling for it's somewhat bulky size but the acceleration lacks. Its not a weight issue, but an issue of low HP. Which is.. exactly what one should expect given its not a mucle car. Also, people seem to dislike the way the car actually rides, but keep in mind that this is not a Cadillac or Lincoln. If the car had air ride controlled shocks then i would have the same compaint but since that's not the case, I'm ok with it. The ride is smooth and easy but you can ""feel the road"" for lack of better words. Not in an abrasive or annoying way, more of a sense of awareness for the road itself. It's overall a very nice car with, so far, no bullshit attached. 

Worth buying, but know the worth of the car before hand.


Also, as a footnote: the car is quite easy and carefree to drive, which could make this a bad ""first car"" for young drivers so take that into consideration before getting this one for your 17 yr old son/daughter. Even as an experienced driver, its not hard to overshoot my speed around curves in the road. On the other hand, the car has airbags damn near everywhere inside of the car so if your gonna flip it, you'll probably be ok :D
"
mercury,milan,2007,John J, 12/28/2006,My first Ford product in over 20 years,5,"I really like this car.  It has a very quiet interior, no squeaks or rattles, accelerates impressively, has plenty of room (and I am 6'2""), excellent ride, handles well in town and on the highway, I cannot think of one shortcoming on this car.  I have been in Chrysler products for many years and this vehicle really drew my attention from the beginning.  I tested the  Honda, Toyota, and Nissan equivalents.  Dollar for dollar, feature for feature, Ford/Mercury got this one right.  It is about time a US manufacturer got their product in line with what we are looking for: value, economy, and styling.  You owe it to yourself to look at the Milan."
mercury,milan,2007,scavio, 11/28/2006,No complaints,4,"I always said that if Ford came up with a solid AWD drive car I'd buy it... and they did.  Got a Silver one with all the options and couldn't be happier.  Exterior is top notch and I liked the styling over the standard Fusion.  Interior is solid (the stitching in the leather seating was impressive) and has plenty of room for my family of four.  The engine could use a little more punch, but it has more than enough power for a mid size sedan.  Handles extremely well."
mercury,milan,2007,bob in murrysville, 12/26/2006,2007 Mercury Milan Premier FWD,5,"I just purchased the 2007 Mercury Milan Premier FWD model.  The auto is well built, inside and out.  Great styling and solid handling.  Very comfortable with excellent driver visibility. Enjoy the exterior puddle lamps - nice feature. I just drove it over 40 miles of western Pennsylvania country roads and it handled superbly. I parked it next to a new Honda Accord at the employee lot at work and the Milan is every bit as nice (or nicer) than the  Accord.  I am a  civil engineer by occupation and I must say that I am very impressed with the vehicle."
mercury,milan,2007,Wes, 11/21/2006,Great Car,4,"This car is a great looking fun car to drive.  I went from a supercharged Mustang GT, and unfortunately had to get rid of due to purchasing a house.  I am very happy with this car, sound system is awesome, looks different than anything on the road, and is very comfortable to drive.  "
mercury,milan,2007,DeDe, 01/20/2007,Really nice American Company Car,4,I just got this car and drove it some 1300 miles . The car ran very well and did all of the things that I expected for less money than some other AWD vehicles.This car is smooth and quiet on the road and comfortable to ride in.   I bought this car to replace my AWD SUV and I'm very pleased with the quality and performance.This car is very nice looking and has lots of eye appeal. I ordered the sport package with spoiler. 
mercury,milan,2007,Lee , 01/16/2007,Mercury Milan V6,5,"I bought this Milan for my 16 year old son as a B-Day gift because i felt that It was the best out of all the other midsize sedans it has plenty of Safety and Security Features which was #1 on my list of must haves and it has plenty of Luxury features at a great price the car drives and rides well and is safe and solid and has a cool sporty look and i have always be a big fan of Mercury they have always treated me as a valued customer i have owned Grand Marquis and Sables and still do But the Milan is the most modern one with the most up to date features and style so i think i made a smart choice by choosing Mercury Milan Safe,Solid,Sporty what more could you want Overall Great Car ..."
mercury,milan,2007,rav4man, 10/18/2010,Great car,4,"Look at the prices at the Merc/Ford dealers as these come off leases, fantastic deals. I have the leather light tan and black combo. Front seats are a little uncomfortable, seats do need to be higher. Did new rotors and ceramic brakes at 53,000 miles, now rides perfect. Climate controls excellent. Road noise very low. Excellent ride on the highway.MPG is 28 highway 23 city. Transmission 6 speed automatic nicest tranny I ever felt. Shifts silky smooth. Get the 6 cyl, 4 is underpowered. Do check out the Lincoln mkz which is the same car also, interior is ultra excellent on that ride"
mercury,milan,2007,Steeler, 01/03/2007,Nice car,4,"Replaced my wifes VW Jetta with this AWD Milan. Very happy so far with this car. Interior is comfortable and attractive in 2-tone with the wood dash trim. Power is acceptable. While you won't win many drag races you will have no trouble accelerating safely onto the highway. Ride blends a sporty feel without being to harsh. Gas mileage could be better, hopefully it will improve as mileage adds up. Overall a lot of car for the money."
mercury,milan,2007,chuckt6, 10/15/2012,"Good Value, Transmission is major issue",3,"This has been a good car.
I really like the interior and exterior styling.
The interior leather has held up really well, even when my dogs have ridden in the backseat.
It hasn't scratched or worn through like some other vehicles.
It has been a pretty reliable car, I have 120,000+ miles on it, yes I drive a lot.
The transmission failed at about 106K miles(i have the 5 speed automatic).
It sounds like this transmission has problems in the Fusion and Mazda 6 as well.
New from the dealer the tranny will cost you $6000, crazy for a $23K car.
I had mine rebuilt for $2500 and so far so good.
The brakes have been bullet proof, I still have my original brake pads and rotors."
mercury,milan,2007,mark dichter, 04/26/2010,1st car and love it,5,"first of all the ride in this car is smooth on the road and tight in the corners thanks to volvo. Mercury was smart in designing this car because they put a wonderful engine in a light reliable chassis. i average 400 miles to the tank and for a V6 with some pony's and some torque thats amazing. I overall love my car and would recommend it ti anyone who wants a luxurious car and if they want to have fun every now and then (but of course in a safe way) this is the car for you. For the parents on here this car is reliable safe and will make your son or Daughter love you for ever. trust me because this is coming from a 17 year old. 1 last thing is i got this with 30,000 miles for only $13,500"
mercury,milan,2007,j-dool, 11/18/2010,Bought used,4,"This vehicle had most of what I wanted and it had very low miles when we bought it. the car is comfortable on long trips and the heated seats are great on the back. I can't believe we've put over 15,000 miles on it already. We've had no issues what so ever and while going on 4 years old it looks new.  The ride isn't the smoothest but it's not the worst either. I like the 17"" wheels and I think it handles very well for this type of vehicle."
mercury,milan,2007,Tony Maccanello, 01/25/2018,BEST CAR I’ve ever owned!!!!,5,"The best car I’ve ever owned!!! I’ve never had a problem with it. The only things I’ve had to replace are tires and a battery. I change oil ever 5000 miles.  The brakes are still excellent   I did do a good 50,000 maintenance. The car is great to drive. Still has a modern style  I’ve owned about 15 cars in my life. 6 of them Mercedes.  My Milan has them all beat!!!!! I wanted to get a new car but why should I. I just put gas in it and it takes me wherever I want to go. Never a problem!!!!

mercury,milan,2007,Chris, 10/11/2006,Sleek Sexy = Mercury Milan,5,"My new Mercury Milan Premier AWD V6 is awsome it has cool features like a nav. system and power moonroof dual chrome pipes 17"" Alloys Satin Trim on the dash and a Powerful 24 Valve DOHC V6 and the AWD makes for a better handling car and the front seat is roomy and comfortable and the ride is quiet and smooth and the a/c blows ice cold air and i get  good mpg about 27.5 and i really like the paint job called vivid red and the all black leather with the white trim and mine came with the sport pack which i think only added the rear spoiler but its still a tight ride and my girlfriend digs it to so were all cool with it "
mercury,milan,2007,G, 01/17/2007,Milan AWD - Must be a best kept secret?,5,"Like the guy tells the babe in the commercial, this car had me just on the looks.  Now my expectations for sedans are higher.  The styling isn't near as dull as the asian cars.  This car looks and is sporty.  But the sharp lines and sleek look would have you thinking tight and uncomfortable interior - right?  Wrong, this car is just right for me.  It is comfortable and spacious and doesn't leave me with an aching body from entering and exiting.  Granted I wouldn't be talking about these things if I were paying $500+ a month, but I leased this thing at a great price.  I see them up here in Michigan a lot but my daughter says she doesn't see a lot of them where she lives.  Let the secret out!"
mercury,milan,2007,cpuetzer, 10/13/2011,2007 Milan requires new transmission at 75K miles,2,"Started out as a decent vehicle. However, since I purchased the car I have put 75K miles with the bulk of it being highway miles. A low level hum developed and now the dealer and my mechanic confirmed that I now need a new transmission. Ford is only willing to pay 1K of the warranty repair price which leaves me stuck paying (3K). Amazing how Ford is not willing to stand behind their products. Even if I had purchased the extended warranty I still think a tranny should last longer than 75K and would still be unhappy."
mercury,milan,2007,John, 09/11/2015,Not a good car for driving in deep snow. Brakes na,4,"It would be a good vehicle in your not in alot of snow, it gets stuck easily and the traction controls sometimes even makes it worse. Plus vehicle went through at least 3-4 sets of breaks, rotors, calipers, etc in the 2 + years I've owned it. Overall build  is very nice and great looking and driving car. Had all the options and engine and tranny were also great.

mercury,milan,2007,forthesakeof, 08/09/2009,Continuing Mercury,3,"The little Sable (Taurus) that I last bought, made in Chicago, was what i was looking for in reliability. I know the story of the Taurus (why stop?), and I see these new Tauruses on the road. Absolutely beautiful. I loved my sable so much, after only owning GM my entire life, I went to a Ford dealership for another used venture. I found this sweet little demon, oh boy. I saw this baby, next to a silvernother. Mine is AWD, smoke/purplish. Beautiful. I am old enough and experienced in Michigan snow enough to know what AWD means, I am curious. Sound system is superb. Extra trunk room, excellent, easy everything. I am anxious to see what this baby has in store for me. Certainly has the spunk."
mercury,milan,2007,WarNM, 02/08/2010,A nice surprise,4,"I was replacing a car that I initially loved and ended up hating and wanted a car that I had no feelings about.  I saw this slightly used Milan and had read some good things about it. It has won me over, it does everything well, gets very good gas mileage for a 6, and has needed nothing but maintainance in the 35000 miles on it.  The looks have grown on me and I think it is one of the better looking cars in its class. I would recommend it to anyone."
mercury,milan,2007,Snoo, 02/17/2010,Great Car,4,I loved the feel of the car from the first time i test drove a Milan. Plenty of room for my wife and toddler son. Trunk has enough space for stoller and groceries! I love the look of the car as well. 
mercury,milan,2007,Alisha, 03/13/2010,Wonderful Surprise,5,"I owned a 1998 Ford Taurus SHO and recently graduated nursing school and was looking for a new car. I'm very price conscious and had looked at and researched many many cars at many lots. I went into the dealership to test drive a 2007 mazda6. Needless to say I was a little unimpressed the backseat was way too small and it just seemed okay at best. I also test drove two other cars I was almost going to ""settle"" if I got a cheap price or leave till one of the guys that worked there mentioned the Milan. I immediately feel in love. It was perfect from the aesthetic looks interior and exterior to the feeling of the drive. Very smooth. Plus, with a lifetime powertrain warranty. I  knew it was it."
mercury,milan,2007,jacklover, 08/07/2012,Mercury Milan my worst purchase,1,"We purchased our Mercury brand new from a Mercury dealer, got a great price for an AWD car. 
1) The car does not shift when cold unless you lift your foot or reach 5000 RPM
2) The third driveshaft at 75000 miles 1st was replaced under warranty 2nd an 3rd on my tab.
3) Buy tires get the car aligned, the alignment only lasts about 25000 miles . Firestone Bridgestone goodyear not generic tires
4) the dealer must think my wife is an idiot. Free inspections are not free, they will reccomend something not needed. If you ask a question they will deny it.
5) They don't have parts for a vehicle that is 5 years old. The Dealer and Ford Recommend purcahsing a $917.r dollar unit for a $10. breathe"
mercury,milan,2007,Appleton, 12/18/2008,A car is only as good as the driver,4,"I have read a lot of the reviews on this website. I have had my car for a full 2 years. My dashboard doesn't rattle and my speakers are to die for. I drive the 07 V6 AWD Premier model, black leather interior, black exterior, sunroof and spoiler. I keep my maintenace schedule, I don't wait for my car to whine before I fix it, hence my comment, the car is only as good as the driver. I also treat the leather seats every time it gets clean. I have driven mercury models for the past 10 years, without a breakdown. This car will be in the family and on the road 10 years from now. I traded in a Mercedes Benz for this vehicle, and beleive me when I say I got my money's worth. It glides. I love my car."
mercury,milan,2007,awilkin2, 04/11/2009,Best car I've ever owned,5,"This is a fantastic car for the money!  Rides great, very fun to drive, has lots of room and back and a very large trunk with no hinges intruding into the luggage compartment.  Very well thought out design and well executed!  I've owned it for over 2 years, put over 35,000 miles on it and have not had to do anything but change the oil every 7500 miles."
mercury,milan,2007,Lab rat, 06/17/2009,Not your grandma's car,4,"I went to buy a Fusion but decided on the Milan after the test drive.  It's just like the Fusion but had a better quality interior.  I've got 40,000 miles on it now and have had no mechanical problems, but all of the valve stems on the tires gave out at 30,000 miles, leaving me on the side of the road on the coldest morning of the year.  It's a good little car though.  I only buy American and I'm happy with this one."
mercury,milan,2007,katsumoto, 06/28/2009,FirstAmerican,4,This is the first American car I've bought in over 30 years and has not disappointed. After 2 1/2 years I have yet to encounter any problems and the car handles as well as any Japanese or German car I've had in the past. Adequate acceleration and good gas milage for a V6.  I'm still not wedded to American cars but will certainly give Mercury/Ford a close look when its time to replace.
mercury,milan,2007,DaveK, 11/20/2009,Ford Forever,5,"I bought this car for my wife almost 2 years ago. We have not had any problems with this car. In the first 9 months we had it I was broad sided on the passenger side. The car held up GREAT. No injuries and thankfully the car was repairable with no signs there was ever an accident. We have taken it through the mountains with no problem (had 2 men's bags and 2 women's - equates to everything but the kitchen sink - and still got 34 MPG over 700 miles). I love this car so muchmy brother just ditched his Malibu and bought one just like it, except he sprung for the V6 which is also quite awesome."
mercury,milan,2007,johndobek, 11/27/2009,great car,4,i have had this car for a couple years now and i love it. rides great and handles better. its a perfect blend of performance and luxury. the one thing that stands out is how quiet the car is. owning not as long as i have i don't realize it until i get into my wife's jetta. there is no wind noise! 
mercury,milan,2007,DP, 01/07/2007,Smooth,4,Absolutely satisfied. This car runs so quietly and smooth and it looks good. It is a nice blend of style and performance.

mercury,milan,2007,Madelaine, 07/20/2018,This Car Kept Me Safe!,5,"This car treated me so well in the year that I owned it. It was a smooth ride with tight steering and excellent braking. I never had any issues with it and I took it in for regular maintenance. The interior is spacious and appealing. When I was T-boned, it kept me safe, although there is a recall on the airbag, so the passenger side airbag (where I was hit) did not blow. The only downside is that there is no aux cord. Other than that, I loved this car! I highly recommend it.

We travel a lot, and the passenger seat is terribly uncomfortable. The seats are not designed very well and the headrest is not alligned properly. The handling in the snow is the worst I have ever dealt with."
mercury,milan,2007,kirby, 10/09/2006,Best bang for the buck,5,I decided it was time to get out my SUV and look for a more fuel efficient vehicle. I looked at several makes and models and thought the Milan was the best bang for the $$

mercury,milan,2007,herb's milan, 07/31/2008,Had to be a manual tranny,4,"i bought my vivid red base Milan back in October of 2007 as a dealer demo with 2914 miles on it, and I now have a total of 8000 miles. The gas mileage is outstanding, averaging between 21-24 in stop & go driving, and what a shocker, I get between 36-42 mpg on the highway. The car has a great ride, just make sure the tire pressure stays at 30psi. The power is just fine, as I have already gotten a speeding ticket while shifting gears. Aat 6-ft tall, the driver's seat is excellent."
mercury,milan,2007,WarrenM, 09/27/2008,An excellent car,5,"I have owned this car for 1 year now. No problems at all. It handles well, is very quiet and comfortable and gets great gas mileage. Had not intended to buy a Mercury but I am very happy I did. It has been a pleasure to own this car in comparison to the troublesome and expensive to own and maintain Volkswagen Passat that it replaced. "
mercury,milan,2007,Mark, 11/26/2008,Great car!,5,"We were looking for better mpg in our vehicles, but don't like to compromise comfort and options. We found a dealer demo Milan and loved it from the test drive. Great highway mpg 31-35. Love the interior, very roomy and comfortable, and stylish with two-tone leather seats. No problems with this car and it really stands out from the crowd with great exterior styling. 4 cyl. engine has plenty of power for our driving needs. Looks like we will have this car for a long time. Quality and options make this a great value for your money. "
mercury,milan,2007,Average Joe, 12/31/2008,Best in Class,5,"Campared to similar vehicles in this class this is the best I've owned for the price.

mercury,milan,2007,patmass7, 03/23/2009,Great Little Car,5,I'm used to driving a luxury car but due to change in lifestyles I had to downsize. The Mercury Milan is a great vehicle to drive with just enough bells & whistles to make it comfortable.  It has a large trunk that opens into the backseat so I could haul things. Nice leg room and rides smoothly.  Would like to have more pick-up when passing but it does the job for a 4cyl. Sweet little car. 
mercury,milan,2007,S. Runion, 04/04/2009,Great overall car,5,I've driven this car for a bit over two years with no complaints.  It's gone back to dealer only for service.  I can't understand people saying lack of power.  The 3.0 with 6 speed trans. has lots of get-up-and-go.  Improvements desired?  A thermometer display and more accessory outlets.
mercury,milan,2007,chris caggiano, 01/27/2008,"Great value, great car",4,"After owning two Nissan Maximas in a row, their size and price had balooned beyond my needs. I never thought about Mercury until I did my homework and test drove the Milan. Handling is competent and accurate, ride is very comfortable but not sloppy and cabin noise is nill.  The 6 cyl engine mates well with the 6 speed automatic. To my ear it produces a better note than the CVTs in Nissans, etc. Fit and finish are outstanding. For some reason this car looks best in dark colors. So far,after ten months, no repairs or problems. "
mercury,milan,2007,daveo, 02/01/2008,Very satified,4,Having owned Ford Tarus before I decided to try a Mercury. The V-6 has plenty of power and when you want to get going at Interstate speeds just kick it and the motor answers back. The ride is excellent. Seats are very comfortable. The exterior appearance has a very sporty look. This Mercury is not your Father's Mmercury. I love just driving the car each and every time I set behind the wheel. The V-6 24 valve engine is very lively. What a fun car.

Very Classy, sophisticated, and reliable.  I could take a long road trip in this vehicle and be comfortable the entire time.  Plenty of power, everything is easily accessible, steering wheel mounted controls are a must! The only thing I would request in future vehicles is the outside temperature reading.  Other than that, this car is outstanding!  "
mercury,milan,2007,Clyde, 02/22/2007,Nice Car,5,"Like the styling, inside and out. Decided to buy it before actually seeing it by reading the reviews. Fun to drive, and the wife really likes it! Got it in red and black leather with the wood simulated dash - the only way to go. Looks great! Price was great. Great power for a 4 cylinder automatic. Contrary to some reviews, the acceleration is quite adequate. Wish it had a garage door opener, an electric passenger seat, a tighter turning circle, and fold away side mirrors. Tough to handle in tight spots when parking. Overall this car is the one of the best kept secrets out there. Don't see very many yet. A great buy and a lot of fun to drive."

In our price range, the options were Subaru (tiny), and now comes a Ford/Mercury AWD.  I have been very pleased with Ford over the last decade, and have leased 2 Escapes.  Looked at this car, and she loved it at first sight!  Great looks, excellent safety features.  Drive to VT for skiing, and it handles in snow!  For the price, this car rocks on features and looks!  Wow! We are very pleased with this purchase.  The dealer was very eager to make a deal, and the rebates were good.  I very much recommend this car!"
mercury,milan,2007,Aimee, 02/26/2007,Best value for the money,5,"I Bought this car not even knowing what a Milan was. This truly is a great car. After driving a Honda Accord as a rental for a week, the Milan is far superior over the Accord. I love everything about this car. Would advise test driving one if you are in the market for a new car.

System is very easy to use and the Sirius Satellite Radio is awsome. The 221HP V6 has great pick up and gets great fuel mileage and the overall style of the car is great looking very sleek and very solid built no gaps in the doors all closed very tight and the rear spoiler looks great and the Dark Blue paint looks great with the big satin Mercury grille and i love the shape and design of the taillights and the L.E.D Lights really set them off. The Mercury Milan is just an overall great car to own i suggest you go and check one out ....

mercury,milan,2007,lclyles, 04/25/2007,I like it,5,"I was skeptical about a 4 cyl. engine in a mid size car, but it really surprised me. The interior room and looks of the Milan along with the standard equipment sold me.  With the exception of the Focus and the Sonata, the other cars were several thousand more than the Milan, when comparably equiped.  Avg. gas mileage is 21 in town."
mercury,milan,2007,Bill, 03/23/2007,Mercury Milan...who knew it was so good?,5,"This car was a real surprise to me. I thought I might lease an MKZ. I drove the MKZ and was impressed. Then I drove the Milan! What a difference! The Milan is a better car for the money.   It's equipped with a audiophile system, moonroof, heated seats. All for under 26k.   

The price point beats Honda and Toyota all to heck!"
mercury,milan,2007,Les, 03/25/2007,The Great One,4,"The Milan has to be the best car for the money. Ford really got this one right. The ride, looks and performance are all better than expectations.  My wife and I looked at the Honda Accord, Nissan Altima, Toyota Camry, Hyundai something or other and the Buicks.  Not one of them came close to what we got with the Milan. You must drive this car before you make a decision about any other car.  Get the V6 Premier.  You will not regret it.    "
mercury,milan,2007,BETH SMART, 03/24/2007,Pure heaven to drive,4,"I looked at Toyota, Mazda, Chevrolet, Kia, Hyundai. Then I saw the MILAN. Wow, what a beauty. I got off work one afternoon. Someone told me to go out and get a new car. I saw it, drove it it was perfect. Turns on a dime. What get up and go too. Gas mileage is wonderful. Auto door locks are great what a safety feature. Three cheers for Ford Motor Company for this headturner. Watch out Toyota. The MILAN will leave the Camry in the dust. "
mercury,milan,2007,glynn hebert, 04/11/2007,You've gotta drive a Mercury,5,"I chose Milan Premier V6 in Silver Birch Metallic with the Stone Interior.  The contrast stitching adds a unique, distinctive touch.  Like all of the standard features that would cost much more on Toyota or Honda.  It's comfortable, sport and fun to drive. I especially the the 3.0L Duratec V6 engine. Mercury has a winner. Drive the rest, then drive the best.  "
mercury,milan,2007,CMW, 04/18/2007,Love My New Car,4,I just got my Milan. I chose the Milan hands down over the Chrysler Sebring. The Milan offers so much more for the money. I love the interior (I don't even have the fully loaded model) and am completely satisfied with the comfort. The only complaint I have is the gas mileage isn't spectacular for a 4-cylinder automatic. I am hoping it gets better once the car is broken in.
mercury,milan,2007,liltraverler, 07/02/2007,Excellent Vehicle,5,"I test drove the following vehicles, Hyundai Sonata, Chrysler 300, and a Ford Fusion and none of the cars compared to the Mercury Milan. Great riding car, excellent gas mileage, and great sound system.    "
mercury,milan,2007,Keri , 07/14/2007,Excellent Vehicle,5,"I traded in a 2005 Pontiac G6 for my Milan. Within a week I knew that I had bought the right car. I had test drove a Ford Fusion, Chrylser 300, Dodge Avenger, Dodage Charger, Hyundai Sonota and a Chrysler Sebring and nothing could compare to my Mercury Milan. The audiophile sound system is great. I love the jack for my MP3. Leather seats are so comfortable and I like the power driver seat. It has a a rich looking interior. Gas mileage is fabulous. I would purchase again! "
mercury,milan,2007,displayname, 07/18/2007,Milan,4,This car is awesome. I love it. I'd recommend it to anyone. The styling turns heads and it looks a lot more expensive than it actually is when its rolling down the road.
mercury,milan,2007,gwert, 08/08/2007,Three Month Report Card,4,"Overall I love it but there are a few quirks:   Tires:The Premier tires will cost over $1K to replace (more than my first car).    Steering Wheel: I haven't been able to really get comfortable with this one, I think the armrests are too low, which is odd for a telescoping s.w. 2007 model does not have universal garage door.  The fuel guage is too small.  The parcel shelf is too high, making the rear window too narrow.  I would have sacrificed some room in the trunk to increase visibility.   The satellite radio text does not scroll, which means you have to constantly push the button to check artist/song.  Floor mats seem paper thin. No Glove box or key lights"
mercury,milan,2007,Gallowsman, 09/09/2007,Wow! Nice Ride,5,"This is definitely a ""High End"" vehicle. The ride and handling is solid and sporty. The V6 has all the power one can expect, it does the job. The interior is well designed and laidout, no clutter. The rear seating is made for adults, 2 comfortably. The truck is a ""3 Body"" truck, and with the fold-down rear seats you got all the room you need short of needing a pickup truck bed. The exterior is clean and sporty with wheels that setoff the styling."
mercury,milan,2007,Warren, 10/01/2007,Very Impressed so far,4,"After my last car which I couldn't wait to buy, and then couldn't wait to get rid of, I wanted a car that I didn't care much about. I never gave Milan any consideration, but saw this one and liked it.  It has only been a month but it grows on me each time I drive it. The quality of it is as good or better than the Passat it replaced. It rides very smoothly and handles nicely. The steering is not overly assisted. The leather interior is beautiful and very comfortable. The exterior design is very good looking as well. It definitely looks more expensive. I'm not sure why you don't see more of these on the road, but it is nice to stand out in a crowd of Hondas, Toyotas and Nissans. "
mercury,milan,2007,drlmg, 06/18/2007,"Bought for work car, but....",5,"I bought this car to drive back and forth to work....appx. 35000 miles per year. I was not expecting much for the price but I have ended up liking this car more than 2 others that cost $65,000 and the other well...over $65,000. The car runs, drives, and handles great. Great sound system (pioneer with GPS). Very tight steering and handling. Ride..very good, however I do have one issue related to this. Being front wheel drive normally would not be a hit with me but I actually like it in this car. In short I love this car. It is far beyond what I expected. I will go as far as to say it is one of the best cars I have ever owned.....and aside from my school years, the cheapest!"
mercury,milan,2007,garyw, 06/18/2007,Excellent Car,4,"As a former Honda and Toyota owner, I was really surprised how much better the Milan drove compared to the Accord or the Camry. It's quick, handles very well, and is quite comfortable. AWD is an added bonus."
mercury,milan,2007,garyw, 06/21/2007,Excellent Car,4,"After test driving several cars, I chose the Milan based on the overall feel and value of the car. It is comfortable, quick, and handles very well. Having had mostly Toyota, Honda, Nissan in the past, this car was a pleasant surprise."
mercury,milan,2007,Rich Lee, 07/14/2007,Had to be a 5-speed manual,5,"So far, I am very pleased with my Milan Premier. The Milan is a best-kept secret. I had picked out an Alloy Fusion SEL but just couldn't go through with it. Odd- looking fog lights. So, I located a black/black Premier about 100 miles away, brought the print-out to my local dealership, and they arranged to have it delivered. During my first day, I continued to hear conflicting info RE: outside temp display. I called the service dept, and they told me where it was. Press EXT on the auto climate center.  The gas mileage has inceased to 24 after 600 miles and is continuing to improve."
mercury,milan,2007,BG, 08/07/2007,It is fun to drive not just a ride!,5,"Although I only have 1000 miles and have owned the Milan for only a month, I am completly satisfied.  What a fun car to drive here in the hills of Western Mass on our rural roads. I like the economy of the four cylinder with a five speed stick, but the real pleasure is it is fun to drive.  The Premier with leather and moon roof gives it a touch of class over the cheap interior of similar priced imports"
mercury,milan,2007,FF DGHTR, 10/15/2007,First car,5,This car has been absolutely great so far. My mother and I were on out way to make a deal on a Ford Fusion and we saw the Milan. We fell in love. It has the same basic design on the inside but the exterior is much more classy. I don't know much about cars seeing as how it is my first but my car enthusiast boyfriend tells me it was a great buy. It picks up fast (V6) and is great for merging on the freeway. I've had no regrets so far. Everyone is fighting over who gets to drive my car.
mercury,milan,2007,ownerofone, 07/21/2007,2007 Mercury Milan,4,"Car lacks good acceleration with any of the engines available.  It is still a fun car to own and drive, however.  "
mercury,milan,2007,rltr, 07/16/2007,Nice little car,4,"I was researching the Ford Fusion when I took the Milan for a test drive and liked it so much better. It's a fun little car to drive.  I've always had a V6 so the revving of the smaller engine is taking some getting used to, but it holds the road good and drives easy once it reaches steady speed.  It's great in the rain compared to what I had before. So far I'm getting 28 MPG highway, but it's steadily climbing."
mercury,milan,2007,Shannon, 08/24/2007,Nice car to own!,4,I love this car! I choose the V6 Premier over the I-4 because of the engine power. This car can really get up and go on the highway. The only thing that I miss about my old car (Toyota Corolla) is the fuel economy.
mercury,milan,2007,jwr, 09/30/2007,2007 Milan w/appearance,5,"So far this has been an outstanding vehicle. Driving a rare 5 speed manual tranny is a real treat, the clutch takeup is as smooth as silk and the tranny shifter is just as smooth. The fuel economy so far is as good or better than the 2002 Focus I traded in on this vehicle. The audiophile sound system is excellent. The car is very comfortable around town and on long highway trips. I would most definitely recommend this car to a prospective buyer."
mercury,milan,2007,Jack, 10/20/2007,Love this Car,4,The car is exceptionally sytled and extremely eye catching inside and out.  The I-4 engine is definitely willing to rev and delivers fun to drive performance while delivering very high fuel ecomonmy.  I have been averaging 26.5 miles per gallon on mostly city driving with a very heavy foot. The car handling and ride are perhaps the best part.  Very tight and very confindent.  Feels like a much higher end sportier ride. I would reccomend this car to anyone who is looking for a high quality great looking car that mixes practicality with good driving dynamics.
mercury,milan,2007,Sailor, 10/28/2007,My second Milan,4,"This is my second Milan. I put 60,000 on my 06 and the only thing I had to do was change the oil every 3,000 miles.  My 07 is now 10 months old and has 37,000 miles on it and again, only oil changes.  I spend at least 5 hours a day in the saddle and could not ask for a more comfortable car. Not sure if I should change with this kind of luck but I may try the CTS next."
mercury,milan,2007,San Jose driver, 11/05/2007,My first American sedan is impressive,4,"I've always owned Japanese sedans - Datsun (now Nissan), Mazda Protege, and Toyota Camry - because of their great reputation. I've now found an American car that can compete with the best of them. The Milan is attractive in the cabin and even more so on the exterior, roomy and comfortable in the front and rear seats, and quiet except upon heavy acceleration.  It handles nimbly and stably around curves. Brake performance is outstanding. The Milan is far superior to my Camry in these 2 respects. The trunk is spacious for a midsize car.  So far, the reliability has been impressive except as noted below. Overall the car is a real pleasure to drive."
mercury,milan,2007,Joe, 03/14/2008,Never a regret!,4,"I was going to settle for another new economy car when after doing some research, I found this 2007 Milan I-4 Premier for sale. Am I glad I found it! The ride is superb along with all the extras I never could have afforded with a new Milan or had with an economy model. The gas mileage is lower than I'm used to, but considering all the perks I have now, I am glad I treated myself to this classy car. I heartily recommend it to those who want a step up from economy cars without spending big bucks to do so!"
mercury,milan,2007,clintondee, 03/16/2008,Everyone loves my Mercury!,5,I picked up an '07 Milan leftover and I'm amazed no-one bought before the model year end. I bought the 5 speed with the 4 cylinder base model and I completely enjoy the car. I'm getting 35 mpg on the open road with the 5 speed. I couldnt get that with my last Corolla or Focus. The Milan dwarfs those cars and is amazingly comfortable. It's great to see that American car companies are once again designing nice interiors. This Milan along with the new Malibu are light years ahead of the models that they replace. My Milan has great thick seats and all power options standard. Side curtain air bags add safety to all riders.  We have to support American Companies & the Milan makes that easy!
mercury,milan,2007,Scott, 03/17/2008,"Great car, get lots of looks!!",5,"This is a great car, has plenty of power and I can pass most of the cars on the road. I've owned a few Hondas and this definitely compares, but isn't seen on every corner. The V6 gives almost 28 on the highway with cruise and no AC on. Great car."
mercury,milan,2007,fx, 03/24/2008,"Six months on, love it",4,"Over the past 6 years we have owned Jeep, Honda, Subaru, Chrysler, Mazda and VW. This is my favorite. The looks and performance beats all the others. I have had zero problems. Can't say that about the others especially the Mazda and VW. I have never owned Mercury and found this more by chance ( looking for AWD to replace Subaru). Besides the handling, comfort, looks etc. I also like the fact that there are very few of these on the road. where as it seems the Subaru is the Official State Car (Colorado)."
mercury,milan,2007,Brad S., 12/09/2007,Shocked,5,"I was searching out a new car and tried Altimas, Accords, Auras along with a few others.  I never really considered trying a Milan because I've never been a real big fan of Mercury.  I was blown away after stumbling on a used one at one of the dealerships. I went out the next day and bought one and have no regret. I don't know what these stupid editors or ""car experts"" get their info from, but this is a great car.  I have the I4 premier and have no complaints.  It gets great gas mileage, has a terrific interior and the class and style is top of the line.  I would highly recommend this car to anyone."
mercury,milan,2007,Chris , 04/05/2008,Fantastic car.,5,"I've had this car for a month now and I completely love it. I had a Ford before. It was the most reliable car I ever owned, so I stayed with the company and I have great hopes for the Milan. It certainly has excellent ratings from Consumer Reports. I think the Milan represents great value for the money."
mercury,milan,2007,J, 04/06/2008,Love this car,5,"I never thought that I would see myself at 27 in a Mercury. I went to the dealership to buy a Lincoln MKZ, and drove off very happy in the Mercury! The Premier Package is wonderful! I have owned 9 new cars in the last 10 years, and have not been satisfied with any of them. All ranging from Pontiac to Toyota. The Mercury is the first car that I can actually say, I love this car! I am very picky when it comes cars, and this car exceeds my expectations! I know it will keep me happy for many years. I would recommend this car to anyone! It handles great at all speeds, smooth & quiet, and very quick to respond. With the V6,you get power quickly & quietly! I have to say Ford's quality is back!"
mercury,milan,2007,Gallowsman, 12/11/2007,3 Month Followup,5,Well.  It has been 3 months since I purchased my Milan and I still love it.  Along with all the features I noted in a previous post I finally got to drive it in the snow and wow!  What a great ride.  Traction is unbelievable even on ice.  I am very impressed with this new development along with handling on icy roads.  I now have no regrets for not getting the AWD model.  
mercury,milan,2007,Niki, 04/19/2008,Wow!,5,"We love this car. It drives great and is very comfortable. It offers a lot of interior room. I reccomend the V6 premier with the leather seats. I feel like I am driving a car that should have cost $35,000. Having a family, I wanted something with interior room. This car offers lots of room and comfortable seats. We owned a Chevy prior to our purchase. I will go to a Mercury dealer for any future automobile purchases. We are very satisfied with this car and for once, we do not regret buying this one. We love it and have reccomended this car to our friends and family. My father drove it once and went the next week and purchased one."
mercury,milan,2007,marilyn, 08/28/2018,my wonderful mercury,5,"i so loved this car but after 130000 miles it was time to step up - i owned it for 11years and drove it everywhere!
"
mercury,milan,2008,Nancy, 11/16/2015,Great car,5,"I have had this car for 5 yrs now. Loved it! Had a few problems but nothing major. I would definitely consider getting another one if I were able to find a newer version but I think they have discontinued this vehicle.
"
mercury,milan,2008,cesareoc, 03/25/2014,Avoid Milan & Fusion with 5-speed Automatic Transmission,3,"This car looks great, drive decently, but it has a major problem: the Mazda built 5 speed automatic transmissions. This transmission seems to have a shorter life span than most modern transmission. Mine started to go at around 80k and completely shut down at 95k. It is a seal system that cannot be serviced, and it is expensive to rebuild. Even the used ones cost twice as much as any other used transmission. This along should be a good reason to avoid Milan and Fusion models with this part, and perhaps all Milan and Fusion. "
mercury,milan,2008,MARC, 03/28/2009,Surprised and Pleased,4,"I had all but written off Big three products.  I was coming off my MDX lease and was looking for a more gas mileage friendly vehicle. I was also looking to spend a bit less.  The Milan just had the best look, quietest ride, fun toys(SYNC and CD changer) for the money.  My prior departure from consumer reports recommendations (with ford) have ended badly.  To my surprise CR gave the Milan a full red circle(highest rating) for reliability and Camry was only given an average rating.  The unfortunate rapid depreciation put a quasi luxury vehicle under 2 years of factory warranty into the range of affordability. 28 MPG 60% highway/country roads.  Comp Camry had 80k miles, to a Milan with 16K "
mercury,milan,2008,benkaf, 05/26/2011,Near Luxury at Corolla Prices,3,"I bought a 2008 Mercury Milan Premier 4 cylinder with Automatic with 23K last year.
I put 27K on it in one year, the most I've ever driven.
I've previously owned Mazda, Toyota, Honda, Saab, Volvo and never thought I'd buy a Ford product.
But I can honestly say that I am pleasantly surprised.
I have had no problems other than a squeaky a/c fan (which went away).
The car is well designed inside and out and pleasant to drive, if not refined.
It's also economical.
I have been able to get about 27/33 MPG out of my Milan."
mercury,milan,2008,Wow, 09/20/2010,WOW!,5,"By far the best car i have ever owned. It's great year round, i have yet to have a problem with it. It looks great inside and out. With the sleek design. This car would be great for any family, older or younger person."
mercury,milan,2008,Paul, 08/02/2008,Very impressive car,4,"The car blends handling and comfort remarkably well. The Milan sticks to the road thru hard turns yet still soaks up bad pavement pretty darn well. Power and acceleration are plenty enough for those of us who don't buy a car to race it. Mid and high end power is very good for passing and surging on the highways. Attractive inside and out, this car has all the creature comforts I wanted for about $4000 less than I would of payed for a simiarly equipped Accord or Camry. Factor in the high marks for reliability that Milan/Fusion get and you can't go wrong here."
mercury,milan,2008,VigaGlum, 01/05/2017,A Car to Rely On,5,"I bought this car when the first owner turned it in as a leased vehicle. It was in nearly new condition.  It has been comfortable and economical on trips. The best part about it is that it has required no repairs, only regular maintenance. It starts on the first try, even when the temp is -20F.  As a 4 cylinder, it doesn't have the acceleration of a 6, but it does very well passing on two-lane highways.  I can say honestly it might be the best car I've ever owned in terms of comfort, reliability, and economy. True, it's not a fancy or zippy car, but it's a car you can depend on. * Since I wrote that review, the moon roof jammed and wouldn't shut. After checking with the dealer and two auto body shops, I concluded that the cost of repairing/replacing it was ridiculous. So I took it apart and taped it shut. Three weeks later I traded it in on a Honda Accord Sport. However, I don't blame the car. When moon roofs go bad, they are rarely worth fixing (too expensive). Therefore, I will never buy a car with a moon roof again.
"
mercury,milan,2008,thomusssa, 01/08/2013,Nothing but issues,1,"2008 Milan...must have been 1st run modle or something, everything that could go wrong has. I drive highway miles back and forth to work, consider myself close to average to slightly above avg on how hard I drive a car (and take care of it!).
After approx 68k miles, transmission goes out. Took to Ford dealer, they want $6,700 for reman transmission. Unreal, had to go with used transmission due to cost.
Have had 2 interior items fail, and need replaced. (console tab and short in power outlet)
Now, engine rods knocking?! I see good reviews, but cant understand how so much can happen to 1 car.
I've had a Toyota Corolla with 280k miles, and no major issues. Milan was a mistake for me!"
mercury,milan,2008,Jay, 03/21/2019,Cheap On The Materials But Good On The Ride,3,"Got this thing brand new, it lasted us about 3-4 years before the plastic on the interior started to chip and crumble off. (Literally crumble off) The transmission also started going out around the 95,000 mark. I can only imagine others going through a similar experience, would not recommend getting this car used. It’s a one and done deal (buy new, and sell when it starts to get old)
"
mercury,milan,2008,jAcK nAPIER, 08/14/2007,Too Much Hype,2,"When I test drove the Milan, the dealership did not have a model I wanted; AWD w/ a moonroof.  When I got my car, I noticed that the moonroof cost me 4 of head room.  Consequently I hit my head on every little bump. The design of the back window is poor. You can not tell where the end of the car is and you can not see 3-5feet beyond the back bumper.  God help any of you who have children or pets around when you are driving in reverse.  You would think that engineering would see this risk a mile away.  I hope pregnant women or people who can not stand strong fumes do not buy this car.  The plastic they use in the car is still giving me a sore throat.  Steering is loose at highway speed"
mercury,milan,2008,Larry, 06/30/2008,Solid Choice,4,"Quiet and smooth ride. Excellent on highway MPG at 60 MPH --> 36 to 38 MPG on the onboard gauge on average hilly terrain for Atlanta. A bit noisy at high RPM, but quiet overall. Sync works very well with LG VX9400 phone. Won't miss the park assist, but disappointed at no built-in garage door opener (oh well). Around the neighborhood - averaging about 24-26 MPG as long as don't jump on the gas pedal. Stay moderate  and keep RPM's below 2.5-3K and you'll do well on gas. Handles very well. The interior design is great and the charcoal cloth seats are very comfortable. Wife has a bad back to comfort was king in our choice of vehicle. "
mercury,milan,2008,Scott, 12/17/2007,First Mercury and couldn't be happier!,4,"I purchased an AWD Premier loaded with navigation. It absorbs the bumps very well, it's quiet, has a great stereo, and it handled extremely well in a rainstorm with high winds on my last trip. The 6-speed auto shifts very smoothly. It's a very solid-built car. I especially like the reverse remote sensors when you back up. I've had 2 Honda Accords in the past 6 years, and this Mercury beats them by far. I would buy another Mercury in a heartbeat."
mercury,milan,2008,JP, 03/11/2009,Great commuter,4,"Bought this used Milan as a commuter for a 100 mile daily commute.  So far, averaging 28 MPG mainly HWY miles.  Seats are very comfortable.  The 6 CD changer sounds great.  The sync system works much better with my blackberry then the system in my 2004 Acura TL!  A slight power trade-off but well worth it for the 28 MPG. This car is a great value!"

Getting 30 mpg if going 70 and under.Fun to drive,handles well,love the little things I used to have in my Lincoln like the keypad on the door,compass,auto headlights,calculated mpg etc.but for a lot less money than a Lincoln.My friend has a Lexus 250 IS Awd that cost 10,000 more, has less features,plain interior and has had problems to boot!Go Ford and keep up the good work!

mercury,milan,2008,Dave, 03/03/2008,Wondering what if I had chosen Camry,3,"Chose Milan for $2500 savings over comparably equipped Camry.  Ours is standard 4 cyl with auto package.  Car pulled to right slightly on test drive, became worse as miles passed.  Took to dealer for alignment at 600 miles, they had for 2 and half days.  Had to replace upper control arms after alignment didn't fix problem (TSB from Ford.) Though now tracking better, tire pressure monitor system now shows fault.  Now I wonder if I should have spent the extra money on the Camry.  "
mercury,milan,2008,Don Flory, 03/11/2008,Excellent Choise,5,"I wanted an American brand mid-size V6 sedan. I looked at the Saturn, Dodge, and Pontiac. I was convinced that the Milan had the other three beat in just about all areas. My wife loves the ride, I like the power, and I am very happy with the economy of this power train. We took a 2500 mile trip from Michigan to Florida and averaged 30.6 MPG at 70MPH. "

I drove 300 miles on a trip and averaged 32 mpg. with air blasting and speed average of 70-75 mph. That's good for a v6. The sound system is good. I like the mp3 outlet. There is plenty of storage space and great trunk space. The city mpg is terrible. I average 17 mpg. in city driving. The dash and doors rattle terribly and I drive very carefully as to not hit large bumps hard. The dealer can't fix it. The cloth seats are cheap, period! It needs a digital clock in the radio. There is a storage compartment on top of the front dash. I can't wait for that to also rattle. What a stupid place to put a storage compartment."
mercury,milan,2008,Bob, 10/21/2008,Apples or Oranges? You decide...,4,"I traded in my 2005 Nissan Altima SER for a brand new 2008 Mercury Milan. My Altima SER was purchased used with 8,600 miles on the odometer. The only drawback it had a six speed manual transmission. It had 18"" mag wheels, low profile racing tires, a Bose stereo system, great racing seats, and a powerful 270 hp engine. When I blew the clutch it cost me $1500.00 to get it fixed. Well Nissan blew the repair, I couldn't find reverse at times, neither could I find first. I got so discouraged after several attempts to get it right with Nissan, I went car shopping. I found the Mercury Milan Premier. Its a great car, but its not an Altima SER. Thus my title Apples or Oranges..."

I have no complaints whatsover, except on the standard model which I am leasing, there is only two gears. The lowest gear is too low but the other one is too high for going down steep hills. No problem with the horsepower, it does fine for me. I wouldnt change anything about the looks, it's beautiful inside and out. The Milan makes a great impression on people. The gas mileage isnt as good as I thought, I'm getting around 26 in the mountains. The '08 Milan also has huge trunk space."

Full mileage - difficult to say on 1000 miles driven but AVG. of 23 for mixed driving is not great (our 535i gets 26 avg) - but with a AWD drivetrain it is much better than SUV's Highway is over 30 mpg.  "
mercury,milan,2008,Leo, 11/10/2008,Real review,4,"I am giving the car points by what it realy deserves. This car is decent looking, fairly comfortable, and has good mileage. The car is probably best value due to factory incentives. The problems are - not enaugh headspace for people 6'1"" and over, engine is little bit noisier and definitely not silky smooth. It also lacks the power to accelerate - be prepared to be passed by moms in minivans. I had a problem with steering (pulling to left side), this was fixed by dealership (changed steering rod) as warranty repairs. Otherwise no problem with quality. Everything works fine. Also Ford improved the lights so you can drive at night and actually see."
mercury,milan,2008,mlconlan, 11/19/2008,Top notch sedan,4,"The Mercury Milan is simply a better drive than any of the usual suspects in the mid-size sedan category. The I- 4 does not make for a fast sedan, but I knew that going in. The exterior design is distinctive without trying to be different, and presents an  exceptionally well balanced look. The trim package on my otherwise base model Milan included top rated Michelin tires and beatiful 17 inch wheels. The interior is very well laid out,and sensible. the fit and finish flawless, and reliability 100% so far."
mercury,milan,2008,Pat, 11/24/2008,"Nice vehicle, great price",4,"I purchased this vehicle used with only 3000 miles! It was not my first choice, but I had read about it online and decided to try it. The dealer had it in a back corner. I like the drive and I feel comfortable and I like all of the features, although I will probably never use them all. I am not impressed with my mpg's so far, although I am told it will get better as I ""break the car in"". I am getting 17 highway! Except for that, I love the vehicle. It has a smooth ride and I get no interior rattling (so far) as some have reported. "
mercury,milan,2008,maxie, 12/02/2008,Better than expected,4,"After having my heart set on an Audi A4, I test drove the Milan at the same dealership. When I compared the cars, it was apparent the Milan was the better buy, and I decided to take the chance. Of course, it's not an Audi, but it is very comfortable, has great features like the Sync and the satellite radio, and drives extremely well. After putting about 7,000 miles on it, I'm still happy with my decision and would definitely recommend this car to anyone. "
mercury,milan,2008,vince, 02/03/2009,NICE RIDE,5,"I bought this car a few months ago, and the ride is awsome. Drives like a lincoln. I got the V4, and it gets great gas milage. It has a lot of power for a v-4. About 28 mpg hwy.  The stereo has a great sound. Finger touch steering wheel for radio and cruise control. Leather seats are padded for a nice long ride. Its a classey type car for the money. A little hard to see out the back window when backing. I would recommend this car.   "
mercury,milan,2008,Scott, 02/28/2009,For the money - GREAT car!,4,"I didn't know what to expect from this car.  I traded an 04 STS Cadillac, and thought I was giving up a lot.  Didn't happen!  Love the room in this car.  Love the comfort (I drive 35,000 a year) and love the fact that everything works, no squeaks, and great milage.  Around 25 mpg.  I am VERY happy with this car, and can't wait to buy an 2010.  Love it!"
mercury,milan,2008,Patrick, 01/26/2008,A solid choice,4,"Car is quiet at speed on the parkway. Handles nicely and never loses it's composure.  Rides smoothly.  Disappointing 21 mpg so far with a lot of highway driving.  Hope it improves to around 25 mpg combined.  Sacrificed performance getting the 4cyl as the car must be revved high to pass and accelerate from a stop.  Interior could be more modern but I am glad they didn't copy the Japanese and the guage cluster is a pleasant change from the super huge bright displays seen on the competition. Dash,armrest, and door sills are thickly padded. Do not buy without reverse sensing system as rear window is very high. Doors and trunk sound solid not tinny. "
mercury,milan,2008,I LOVE IT, 08/01/2009,I LOVE IT,4,"I love the looks, performance, and the interior options on this car. I have owned imports in the past, and this car beats them hands down. The ride is very smooth, and handles like a dream. I was very surprised of the great engine performance from an AWD.Consumer Report got this car right. It's the best and safest vehicle on the road today"
mercury,milan,2008,Mr. Rau, 02/22/2008,More elegance at the price of a Ford,5,"The fit and finish as well as tight performance are up to European and Japanese standards, but where this car really excels is in beauty and luxury. We love the front end styling and standard aluminum wheel design.The Wales Mahogany wood interior trim looks sleek with the charcoal leather and contrasting stitching. It's never gaudy, but beautiful. The six-way power driver's seat was standard, even on the base model! The audiophile sound system with the Moon & Tune package is one of the best I've ever used--and with the sunroof, it was only an $800 option. I feel confident that the quality of this car will last, and I'll be delighted to drive it for years."
mercury,milan,2008,Greg , 08/23/2007,My 2008 Milan,5,"I love my Mercury Milan premier. It is a very affordable car. With a 2.3 litre four cylinder engine I average 21 m.p.g. city and 31 m.p.g highway. So my fuel costs are low and so are my insurance costs. The Milan is also a stylish, well equipped car. 17 inch aluminum wheels, a waterfront grille and thoughtful lights grace a body that looks like a more expensive European car. A long list of standard and optional features is sure to please the buyer who wants elegance, comfort, entertainment, information and a great ride. I especially like the soft leather seats with double stitching, the six speaker audio system with radio, Sirrius radio, and six CD changer For a great car try Mercury Milan."
mercury,milan,2008,Nick , 10/19/2007,Mercury makes buying American Fun!,4,"This car stands out from the others in its class. I have the Premier V-6 with AWD. The 17"" wheels and classy interior give this car a high-class appearance and feel at a fraction of the cost. People who see my car instantly change their mind about the Mercury product line. The feel is excellent and the car seems to hug the road with ease. I highly recommend the Milan to anyone that wants domestic and appreciates a little Detroit flair and ingenuity! I never thought I would own a Mercury at my age but I do and now I love the whole Mercury lineup."
mercury,milan,2008,Jim, 10/30/2007,Great car,5,"I went to the dealer to buy a MKZ, but after testing it against the Milan Premier I4, I felt the Milan was well worth the savings of almost $10,000 over the MKZ.  I drive a lot each year and was looking for both comfort and gas economy.  I am extremely happy with my choice.  I have found the I4 to have plenty of pickup for merging on the interstate or turnpike, and the 5 speed gives good pickup at different speeds.  "
mercury,milan,2008,JDL, 03/28/2008,Drove BMW's for 17 years.,5,"The Milan is a well designed car with many features that are exclusive to Ford/Mercury. The car handles well as a BMW528 and for $28000.00 less! Mine is loaded with Nav, bluetooth, Sync, sat radio, AWD, and believe it or not, the car turns heads. It's got power and the car stops on a dime. Handling is aggressive. I did find that the head-room with the sun-roof was tight, but it was fine once I adjusted the seat, and tilted the steering wheel to suit my position. A very minor issue that I have had to deal with before on my BMW's and Mercedes. The car is awesome in the snow. Mercury set out to beat the Japanese manufactures, and they beat or matched the Europeans in the process. A great car!"
mercury,milan,2008,Very Impressed, 04/07/2008,Very Impressed,4,"I really like this car. I traded in a 2006 Mercury Montego, and overall like this car much better. Plenty of leg room in the front, handles very well, nice pickup, and the gas mileage is not bad. The car looks great, better tires and wheels than the Montego, plenty of trunk space. Fun to drive.Overall, I am very happy with this car and would recommend to everyone. Coming from a full size to a mid size makes me like the mid size better. I change cars every 26 months, and this cars a keeper."
mercury,milan,2008,Derrick Bledsoe, 04/07/2008,Excellent,4,"Excellent experience, I honestly don't have any complaints, the ride is great, the color is gorgeous. The v6 power keeps you ahead of traffic."
mercury,milan,2008,jdf2007, 04/08/2008,Better value than Imports,5,"Driven this Milan for 3 weeks and it is a car that you just can't get enough of!  4cyl. w/ 5 speed auto has very good power even with 4 adults. Avg. 28.6 mpg with under 1000 miles on car.  The fit/finish is great and with 17"" wheels this car is very attractive. Drove Honda, Nissan and Kia and this Mercury handles better than all.  For the value this one hard to beat!"
mercury,milan,2008,Pam, 04/09/2008,Love My Milan,4,I have had my Milan for a little over 3 months now and love it. It handles great in wet weather and I was surprised at how it handled in snow. It worked much better in snow than the Subaru I had before this and I thought that was good. The 6 cylinder definitely gives it more power in the snow. I love the sunroof and the stereo is unbelievable! Never thought I would really like or want heated leather seats but now couldn't live without them. The spoiler adds a sporty look to it and I highly recommend you get it. The SYNC system is awsome and takes some patience until you figure out exactly how to use it. It is a bit frustrating at first until you use it alot. Love this car! Buy it!
mercury,milan,2008,Tony, 04/24/2008,My first American car,5,"I owned this car for about one month and I fell in love with it. I drove Honda, Nissan, Mazda before and no one can compare with this Milan. So far I drove about 1,000 miles and MPS is about 26.5. I love digital keypad power door locks and you will never worry about locking you key inside the car."
mercury,milan,2008,JCLOVESYA, 04/27/2008,Great American sedan,4,"I downsized from a Crown Vic & Lincoln Continental. I am a big guy 6"" 215 lbs 65 yrs old. I was a little concerned about buying what is a smaller car but so far I am comfortable. I average 24 MPG in first 1500 miles.If I drive with my foot in it I am getting 20.  Great Handling quiet ride. The sound system is great. Roomy trunk(back seats fold down). The  4 cyl a little week with out high revving but this is the nature of 4 cyls,& I bought for economy. If you need power V6 it. But I am happy with the I4 for the economy. The sound system controls on the steering wheel are great. Handles and corners better than many cars I have driven. "
mercury,milan,2008,M. Whit, 05/01/2008,Camry killer,4,"With only 1000 miles on it, I'm getting 28 mpg on the highway. Holds the road very well - like driving on velcro. Very good base audio system. Leather seats comfortable, especially with the heated seats option. Good over the hood visibility. Large trunk and tons of cargo capacity with 60/40 split folding rear seats. Transmission shifts smoothly and the quiet V6 provides enough power to move this car around. Fit and finish is good and the vapor silver paint job looks great on this car."
mercury,milan,2008,Joseph Soto, 05/07/2008,Beyond Looks... Mercury Milan,4,I bought my 2008 I-4 Mercury Milan Premier because I really loved it's exterior & interior looks. After the honeymoon was over I realized that a 4 cylinder 150 hp engine was not enough to generate excitement during aceleration & passing speeds on this car. To top all my wife bought a 4 cylinder 2008 Nissan Altima S. I drove it yesterday and blew me away with its acceleration. Yes I know it has 25 extra horsepower. But It made me  feel young again. Sorry Lincoln-Mercury. But the truth shall set you free. Looks can be deceiving and Mercury Milan Premier I-4 is really a Grand Pa Corolla in disguise!  
mercury,milan,2008,Pam, 05/11/2008,Love this car!,5,"I've had my Milan for a week now, and love it. On my first tank of gas I am getting 23.9 MPG city.  Have not had a chance for Hwy yet.  I test drove several vehicles, 08 Fusion, 09 Sonata, 09 Corolla, 08 Malibu, 08 Optima, some were better buys I will admit, however, I love the way this car drives and is very comfortable for me. I really wanted a sunroof and heated seats, however, there were none available at this time in the area so I gave them up because I really wanted this car for the comfort.  I purchased the White Suede Metalllic with Camel Leather Interior. I would definitely recommned this car."
mercury,milan,2009,cristo, 12/23/2009,1 Year of Ownership Update,4," It has been a year now since I purchased my 09 Milan. I have logged only 4,500 miles to date, and (so far) no major issues. I will say that the transmission labors a bit to shift out of first gear when it is cold outside. But is fine once warmed up.It does get on my nerves a bit. My absolute MAJOR complaint is with the headrests in this car! Almost unbearable! I notice all of the Ford products have adapted to this design.I will not purchase another Ford product next year if they are not changed. Other than the two issues I have stated,the car is very good! Mileage is in the mid 20's per gallon. I rarely use it on long trips due to the uncomfortable headrests! It gives me a pain in the neck!"
mercury,milan,2009,GEMINILAF, 02/25/2009,Better than the Japanese Imports,5,"Super styling cues. I love the 17"" multi-spoke alloys. Lots of trunk space, especially when you fold flat the back and passenger front seats. Mercury has really raised the bar with quality materials. Love the Microsoft Sync, 6 disc in-dash CD changer, Sirius satellite radio, and all the bells and whistles you would pay extra for in other vehicles in its class.  "
mercury,milan,2009,Skeeter, 04/23/2009,Love it!,5,"I have had my 09 Milan for 3 months.  We have taken one long trip in it.  The rest of the time has been spent driving within 50 miles of home.  Right now I am getting 30.4 mpg with a cruising range of over 500 miles.  With employee pricing and rebates, I was able to buy this awesome vehicle for less than $20,000.  We live in the country so Sirrus radio is wonderful since we can't always pick up a good radio station."
mercury,milan,2009,Larry , 10/02/2008,L/M is back with a high quality car,5,"I picked up my Milan Premier (V-6 FWD) about two weeks ago and cant say enough positive things about it. The ride is very controlled and smooth with just the right amount of steering wheel tension. Turning into a parking space is controlled, easy and tight. I got 24.6 MPG on my first tank of about 65% highway travel. Both interior and exterior fit and finish is excellent. The SYNC voice command system is exceptional. All vehicles should have it to make hands free cell calling mandatory. Its just safer for everyone with your eyes on the road.  "
mercury,milan,2009,Cristo, 12/28/2008,Great basic sedan,4,"Well, I turned in the lease of my 06 Lincoln Zephyr and purchased an 09 Milan Base model with auto transmission. A very good basic sedan and the 4 cyl gets great mileage. After driving a fully loaded Lincoln for 3 years it's hard to go to a base model, however, I don't do the driving I used to. The car is fine for what I need, however, the headrests are very uncomfortable! Why they changed them I'll never know! I had no problem with the ones on my Lincoln. Hopefully, I can switch them out! I've had the car for 2 weeks and I still haven't put gas in it! Great basic no frills transportation."
mercury,milan,2009,Paul, 01/19/2009,V6 Premier,4,"Biggest bang for your buck. What a car. Employing pricing is a give away. Suggest the heated seats as an option. Plays 6 cds full of mp3's, that's at least 600 or more tunes, all info shows on radio panel. The message center is all good info. Once you sync your phone you'll love the option with Microsoft Sync, all info of your phone is displayed on the radio panel, last call, phone book, play your phone MP3's etc. Excepts I-pods, USB port and more. All controls are on steering wheel. The 3.0 engine has been around for a while."
mercury,milan,2009,Joe, 11/13/2010,Love my car,4,"After my initial test drive, I immediately knew this was the car for me. I fell in love with how effortless the car was to drive and become comfortable with. I love the way the car feels when you're driving it, although after moving up from a sport coupe (Eclipse GT) it is lacking a little punch. This being my first vehicle in ten years with an automatic transmission it took some getting used to, but with that in addition to the Microsoft Sync it makes driving so much safer. Plus, I find myself looking outside at the car throughout the day admiring its styling..."
mercury,milan,2009,jas, 05/06/2018,2009 Mercury Milan,5,It is a great all around car.  Looks like new.  Rides well.  Impressive interior.  Would prefer more MPG but it is a 6 and not a 4 cylinder.
mercury,milan,2009,Thank's Dad, 03/15/2009,Thank's Dad,5,"I recently got moved further from home at work making my commute over an hour each way, driving an eight cylinder pick up was not very economical. I was forced into buying a car quickly with out time to research. My father had recently bought a 2008 Murcury sedan, I was amazed I was not familiar with the line of vehicles because it was such a sporty, luxurious ride. When I heard what he paid I was blown away. Needless to say I got lucky he bought that car because he did the research for me. I bought a 2009 Murcury Milan, 4 cyninder for my commute, and all the bells and whistles for the fun. I miss my truck, but unless things change alot I will be a faithfull Murcury owner in the future."
mercury,milan,2009,jinx1928, 01/20/2015,"Excellent car, exceptional value",4,"I made the mistake of trading my 2010 Milan for a Jeep not long ago. I rectified that error by trading the Jeep back in for an '09 Milan Premier with the 3.0 V6 and six-speed trans. I don't understand some of these reviews, especially the ""expert"" ones, which complain about the '09 Milan's lack of power and poor fuel mileage. My Milan has outstanding power and mileage, generally around 33 mpg. Like my '10 Milan, it handles and rides like a champ, but it also has more amenities, like heated leather seats and a better sound system. I like the Milan, as well, for its distinctive styling. It is a good deal different from its sister, the Fusion, and over looks like nothing else on the road. "
mercury,milan,2009,cotto1973, 11/19/2008,Excellent Car,4,"I have to admit that doubted the commercials claiming that the Milan/Fusion was preferred over the Camry and Accord. Driving is believing. You have to drive one to believe that this car is on par with the Camry and Accord. The Milan is an impressive car.  The handling is excellent.  Before the snow, I put it through some aggressive winding roads. It hugs the road gives you confidence. We received our first snows of the season here and have had no trouble on the roads. The acceleration is is good. We have about 1000 miles on the car. We average 23-24 MPG in the city. Driving more agressive, the mileage drops to about 21-22 MPG. We haven't driven any highway miles yet.    "
mercury,milan,2009,George, 05/03/2009,Who Says America can't build a great car,5,This car is superior to my friends Camaries and Accords (all of which have had to go back to the dealer for some issues) - hands down. I don't understand the comments about power and sub-par engines. This car hums along beautifully and I get better fuel economy then the sticker states!! Half the time I can't even tell the engine is running!  To summarize - Don't spend more then you have to on a NAME - buy a great car at a great price!! 
mercury,milan,2009,Prof Baldie, 05/13/2009,First American and Automatic a BUY!,4,"This is our first American car and first automatic.  We considered VW CC, Mazda 6S, Acura TL and Infinity 35.  But felt guilty with the recession and auto industry meltdown so decided to give domestic a try.  We settled on a Hybrid Fusion and made a deposit but lead time was just too long (our second car had been stolen months earlier) and could wait no longer.  Saw the Milan, liked it, did some research and ended up with a Milan Voga with AWD.  Wife still misses her fun-to-drive VW Jetta Turbo and Subaru Outback but loves features of Milan AWD Voga.  Her biggest complaint is the turning circle, which I hope is improved in the 2010 model.  "
mercury,milan,2009,Travis, 05/24/2010,Way to go Ford!,4,"I was in the market for a used Camry or a new Hyundai when I got tired of the snobby Toyota dealer and the fake, high-pressure Hyundai dealer.  I stopped by the Ford dealer and they were awesome; they listened to my needs (a reliable commuter car with good gas mileage and room for 2 teens in the back) and got me into my Milan.  It now has 32k miles on it and has been absolutely reliable and still feels like a new car.  No rattles or squeaks and not unplanned trips to the dealer.  Gas mileage is amazing for this class of car; I get 40 mpg on my way to Phoenix in the morning.  The styling is attractive and fresh without being too flashy and it feels like a much more expensive car."
mercury,milan,2009,Nancy82, 09/12/2010,"Bye, Bye 300!!! Hello Milan!!!",4,"Well, I traded in my '08 Chrysler 300 and wanted something ""different"". My friends always refer to my car as the old, businessman car; as I'm in my 20's and they only see old, businessmen driving it. Lol. I love it and that is all that matters. Driving is still pretty smooth after a year and don't really have any complaints."
mercury,milan,2009,Michael Duvall, 07/03/2009,If I could only give it back,2,"Like a total idiot, I traded in my totally loaded '04 Oldsmobile Aurora to get this car which 'was loaded'; after getting home I begin realizing how there were hardly if any options assumed.  I can't stand this car, the way it shifts, the way it drives, I've already put about 13K in mileage on this car as I commute a ton.  Seats are extremely uncomfortable, interior design is horrible, turning radius is terrible, when you pop the trunk it doesn't self open.  No A/C or heating vents in the rear seats; I can go on and on.  LOOK HARD BEFORE YOU BUY THIS CAR; I AM EXTREMELY DISSATISFIED.  I tried to give it back within the 3-day period of time; but the dealer wouldn't return my calls on how to. "
mercury,milan,2009,MountainGoat, 11/14/2009,Best AWD sedan on the market,4,"Surprise! The Milan's handling is completely competitive with foreign cars! And the AWD coped easily with our icy winter. Our last 3 cars were Outbacks, but the current version didn't have enough leg room, so we switched to the Milan, which has exactly the room we need. Love the comfort, handling, luxury features for the price. Gas mileage averaging 23-24 overall is disappointing, but the V6 power is fun. The driver's headrest hurt my back by forcing my head to tip forward. I had a local welder change the angle. My wife's headrest didn't bother her, because it's not in the way when the seat is reclined the way she normally has it."
mercury,milan,2009,TT, 08/06/2008,Great Value-Great Car,4,"Bought this car a few weeks ago. I had been shopping Honda, Hyundai, Ford, etc. This car is great looking and they did a nice job with the interior- love the contrast stitching-leather very rich looking and feels great. Sync takes some time to learn but is great once you learn how to use it. The steering is also great-heavy and accurate. This drives and looks like a much more expensive car. Sticker was 26,620 and I paid 22,900.  What a value."
mercury,milan,2009,Bill, 11/16/2008,Good choice for us,5,"After 4000 miles, we are happy with the car. It has all wheel drive, which we need in our area, room for real people in the back seat, which we need, good comfort overall, a smooth ride, plenty of power, and all for a reasonable price."
mercury,milan,2009,Ed. Oesterle, 11/07/2008,2009 Voga Milan,5,"I have owned Lincolns and Mercurys for years. I was introduced to the Milan, and shown a Voga style dressed up Milan. I feel in love with just the white leather seats and all the beautiful stainless trim. This style has all the other so called best sellers put to shame. The car is black with the white leather. A head turner. The Milan is a true performer, highway driving is wonderful, the interior outstanding and comfortable and the V6 engine has a lot of get up and go. This car has already shown 24 and 25 miles per gallon and is not even broke in yet, we are a retired couple and we feel young and classy when we drive it. I'm also blown away with the sound system, sync and satellite radio. Overall the car is superior and outstanding in all aspects. "
mercury,milan,2009,Tom48413, 01/03/2009,From a huge car to a midsize,5,"I traded my 05 Lincoln Town Car for an 09 Milan V6 Premier AWD with the VOGA package. I wasn't sure I'd like a mid- size car after such a huge car, but now I know what the reviewers mean when they talk about handling.  This car handles beautifully. I've really tested the AWD this month here in Michigan, as we've gotten a lot of snow and ice, and I haven't gotten stuck yet.  My Milan rides very nicely and I love the VOGA interior: camel with black trim with camel stitching."
mercury,milan,2009,Mike7, 02/03/2009,Mustang to Milan,5,"Great car, not as quick as the Mustang but has almost as much horse power as my '92 Mustang. Handles very well, build quality is great, terrific in snow. I don't get the love affair with foreign cars. I've yet to be in one that surpasses the quality of this car."
mercury,milan,2009,srecz, 01/31/2009,have your airbags checked,4,"My wife was just broad-sided by an suv traveling at 30-40 mph. The Milan's side airbags did not deploy. Fortunately,she did not suffer serious injury, but certainly could have in such a serious crash. I would suggest to anyone owning a Milan return to the dealership to have airbag system checked."
mercury,milan,2009,Steve, 02/26/2009,Luxury you can afford!,4,"Ride is wonderful, yet still tight & sporty.  Power is great with really good mileage for a V6.  Interior is classy, yet sporty with Burlwood Dash. Love SYNC, Navigation, Bluetooth Phone & Stereo all working together. Plenty of room for everyone. Best car I've owned to date. FORD Motor Company has been and always will be my CHOICE for a new car. Made 'mostly' in America, but American owned company is the only way to buy!!!!"
mercury,milan,2009,Flyguy313, 02/26/2009,Love this Car!,4,"Just traded in a 2008 Accord LX, Wanted a fully loaded Fusion or Milan with Navigation. The Ford incentives with $3500 cash back was too good of a deal to pass up.The dealership was fantastic and the buying experience was a pleasure. I wanted the Milan Premier with Navigation,spoiler and rear parking assist with heated seats in Smokestone/Camel, and thats what I got. Love the Sync system and Navigation. The Navigation system was rebated off the sticker $1600 so it only cost about $200."
mercury,milan,2009,Steve C, 03/01/2009,2009 Mercury Milan Premier,5,"My wife and I have been looking at different make and models in this size range. We have been toyota owners for the past 30 years and let,s face it the US automakers for a while could not compete for style and reliability with the foriegn makers.Through consumer reports and Edmunds  we investigated this model and the Fusion for US models. After test driving we determined the Milan felt more tight and comfortable. Our model has the works as far as options, and everything is easy to reach within the cab.Mercury has hit a home run with this model. Perhaps the near collapse of the domestic market has spurred on this innovation and I beleive FOMOCO has turned the corner on the market."
mercury,milan,2009,dsvetcov, 03/09/2009,Lexus convert,4,"I traded my Lexus es350 for a new milan.  The main reason was price.   I opted for the Merc as it addresses a more seasoned buyer (ug..age) over the ford Fusion.   Too bad LM does not heavily market this vehicle.  It is superior in many ways to the foreign competitors as well as GM.    Get the premier edition and the with Microsoft sync.  It makes driving fun, as well as a very comfortable and price savvy experience."
mercury,milan,2009,fordman62702, 03/30/2013,great car,4,"I've had my Milan for almost a year now and it's been a great car. Put 11,000 miles on it with not a single issue. Like the looks of the car better than it's Fusion cousin. Mine has the two-tone leather interior, love it. Cleans right up. Has plenty of power for a 4 banger. Sound system is awesome. Controls are easy to use. I just can't say anything bad about it. Just buy one, you won't be disappointed."
mercury,milan,2009,EP1, 03/22/2009,Love the looks,3,The style & looks caught my attention right away my previous car was the Buick Lacross. The Milan handles better and rides tighter than the Buick and corners like its on rails but is just as quite on the inside on the highway! The looks are so much nicer than the Accord and Camry!
mercury,milan,2009,Jim, 05/18/2009,2009 Milan is a great value,4,"I traded in a 2003 Honda Accord EX for my 2009 Milan VOGA.  The Milan styling is unique and the VOGA in white suede turns many heads.  Many have said they didn't know Mercury made such a nice looking, sporty sedan.  I've had many compliments on the looks and the car is just as fun to drive.  I was also looking at a Chevy Malibu, but with the incentives and discounts  I got more options for less money with the Milan.  I have the 4-cly. and I range between 30.4 and 33.6 mpg. and I don't even have 4000 miles on it yet.  I'm anxious to see what kind of mileage I get on a trip this weekend.  I suspect Ford is going to give the imports some serious competition with this model.    "
mercury,milan,2009,Happy Owner, 05/29/2009,Ask the Man who Owns one,5, Can't understand the bad reviews that the power trains get on these cars. Being a auto mech I was impressed with the power of the 4cyl. The workmanship in this car is perfect and would compare to any higher priced car. This is a great car for the American public and for the price it sure is a buy. Buy Ford Products
mercury,milan,2009,Earl, 07/06/2009,drifting,4,It feel good but then there was drifting to the right and you had to keep pressure on the steering wheel all the time to stay on the road.  they have worked on it and also lied to me what had been done and basically have told me live with it.  Some of the work that was done was not told to me and when I question them different stories.  the real problem is that they showed me letter that some of Ford and Mecury front wheel drives will drift to the right and states no correction needed. ( my point is that they didn't tell me about any drifting before I purchased this vehicle or I would have got a Chevy.  Ford is not up front with there customers.  
mercury,milan,2009,mick, 07/06/2009,nice car,4,"I went from a Ford Explorer, that used to be my daughters but that's another story, to a new 2009 Milan and it has been wonderful. I was worried about the power of the I4, but it has plenty for my taste. After driving the v6 and was certain that the I4 would serve my purpose. I drive it mostly to work, about 10 miles one way, but my wife ownes an Lincoln MKX and we are finding ourselves driving the Milan more and more. Great little BIG car from Ford."
mercury,milan,2009,Fearnewine66, 08/28/2009,American Car as good as the imports :),5,"I have owned over 10 vehicles (Taurus, Camry, Scion, Sonata, etc.) and this one is the best. Was planning on purchasing a Camry but the 2009 Milan was too good of a car and too good a value to pass up. Lots of features for the money, great fuel mileage (31 mpg so far), build quality is excellent, it looks classy and its been dead reliable. I drive 50,000 miles a year and am pleased with the comfort level and fun-to-drive of this car.  Ford is making good American cars and my Milan is proof :)"
mercury,milan,2009,rgtstylist, 09/06/2009,Finally got mine!!,5,"I have admired the Milan since the 2006 model hit the streets.  And when I decided to sell the 2 cars I had and just have one their was only one I would consider, the Milan Premier.  It has everything that a more expensive car has but at a reasonable price. And at the time i had many to chose from.  Driving this car is a dream and the looks are fantastic!  I still just LOVE to look at it.  The ride is so smooth and my fuel economy is better than posted here but I do almost all Highway driving.  I did have a minor brake issue from the car sitting on the lot and not driven for an extended period of time but the warranty covered everything. It is my 36th car and my favorite of all!#2a1995camero"
mercury,milan,2009,Simon, 04/14/2010,Nice Trade in,5,"We had a Ford Freestyle, I always complained to my wife that she was spending to much in gas. We drove from Dallas TX to New Orleans, last summer with one tank of gas. 490 miles. I had to stop to fill in cause my wife was afraid we ran out of gas otherwise it would reached around 520. It's my wife car, but I love driving it, we average around 26 city and 32 HWY. However since we bought this car my 05 Mercedes is mostly in the Garage, we both like this car. Hopefully FORD will continue building great cars. "
mercury,milan,2009,Bhagen05, 07/31/2010,Nice Ride!,4,"I've had my Mercury Milan for about a year and a half now. I really enjoy how the car handles and the performance. Haven't had anything replaced that was major. Only a few electronic things got replace, a roof molding and the driver leather seat started to crack. All and all the car is a great buy. I still get people who say that it is a nice looking car. especially with the metallic flakes in the paint!"
mercury,milan,2009,ep1, 06/22/2011,Liked the car,3,"The design of the car is what sold me as well as the reliablilty of previous model years

mercury,milan,2010,gta, 12/02/2010,Very pleased,4,"Was leaning heavily toward Fusion but went for the Milan because I liked the exterior styling better. I've read the other reviews and it's all subjective, but imo this is a great car. The leather seats are probably the most comfortable bucket seats I've ever sat in, and with 8-way adjustable seats plus tilt and tele steering wheel, there should be a comfy seating position for everyone. The lumbar support helps a lot too. Mpg is good, I get around 28 in combo city-highway driving. Build quality appears good. Very quiet at 70 mph, zero wind noise with the windows up. A little more road noise than I would like, but not a major problem. A few minor gripes (see below) but I'd buy this car again."
mercury,milan,2010,skater69, 01/05/2013,Nice and refined-2010 base automatic,4,"I have the 2010 base automatic (there was no option to select this on Edmunds).
Bought the car used with 26K miles. Came with a nice sunroof, leather wrapped steering wheel, fog lights, SYNC..etc.
It's nice and comfortable to drive.
Quiet, great mileage, good power for a 4cyl, very nice cloth seats.
I really enjoy this car.

Handles well too but if you're looking for a sports sedan, I wouldn't go that far.

Just a really nice car in my opinion.
A steal for the price used.
Feels/looks like a classy ride."
mercury,milan,2010,kiwiaudio, 02/12/2014,LED Brake/Tail Light Issue,4,"Fully agree with hsmith1. This LED lamp fault looks like becoming an epidemic, and is a safety concern.
I would urge all to contact Ford 1 800 392 3673 +1 +5 to lodge your complaint.
Also fill out the complaint form with NHTSA http://www.nhtsa.gov/

Until we push, Ford will not acknowledge !

Update: Well, they acknowledged! Ford replaced the lights at no cost to us.

mercury,milan,2010,Bill Gamelli, 08/12/2010,Not bad car,3,Bought the V6 all wheel drive for wife. Perfect size for her and bought the Milan instead of the Fusion because Mercury is going out and got $4500 off sticker. Will always get parts for it but did not really think about my resale value since Mercury will be no more.
mercury,milan,2010,thecbob, 08/25/2010,2010 Milan Premier,3,"I traded down from an F150 SuperCrew Lariat to save money, which I did. Even with a 4-cylinder, it handles well and gets great gas mileage. The driver seat is extremely uncomfortable, causing muscle pain on my commute to work. (one hour each way)In less than two months after purchase, it squeaks and rattles like a 30 year old car instead of a new one. I may be saving money, but I'm really starting to miss my truck."
mercury,milan,2010,kaylinda, 08/17/2013,AWESOME & RARE,5,I just bought my 2010 Mercury Milan. I have wanted this car since I was little. Never thought I would have a opportunity to buy one. I absolutely love it. It is everything I wanted and more. I did my research before buying and it lives up to all the great reviews. I love that I don't see any in my neighborhood or anywhere really. My boyfriend has a Mercury Marauder so as you can see we like cars that aren't seen on a daily basis! Merc Squad haha I would definitely recommend this car! Its beautiful and smooooooth!
mercury,milan,2010,Betsy, 02/11/2010,Love my Milan,5,"I looked everywhere for a cash for clunker deal...tried every car on the market & was very disappointed until I pulled onto the Lincoln/Mercury lot. One look at my Milan & I was hooked. The Sync entertainment system is the best on the market.  One complaint: The headrests on the front seats were so bad, I almost couldn't buy the car. Headaches and back pain from the unnatural, extremely awkward head position...picture head jutting forward, with the back curled clam shell-like...not a good look on me. After taking the car to the upholsterers to see if he could stuff the seats, he fixed the problem by bending the head rests up & ""Millie Pearl"" & I drove home a happy duo!"
mercury,milan,2010,Ginny, 05/20/2010,"Good, but....",4,"I've had my Milan for a month and I love everything about it EXCEPT the location of the temperature controls, which truly create unsafe driving conditions.  They are placed too low and are hard to reach.  I have to take my eyes off the road too long when I want to change the fan speed or set the defrost, or turn on/off the air conditioner and heater.  This is a big enough problem that I would not have purchased the car had I known.  Other than that I love the safety features of the car.  I have the BLIS and the rear camera and would do both again.  I like being able to enter the car by typing in a code - that's a great feature when traveling with others.  Head rests are uncomfortable. "
mercury,milan,2010,jwtownse, 09/15/2012,Excellent Entry-level Car,4,I've had this car for about two years now and it has only needed routine maintenance (aside from some bad gas I filled up with from BP). The exterior is a little bland but has grown on me. It's the interior of the car that sold me and that I still love. The heated leather seats are great in the winter and the Sync system can be a little buggy at times but is usually perfect. 
mercury,milan,2010,Rose Icken, 10/10/2018,Merc Milan,3,"Watch out for the body's box under the back seat doors.  IT is a rectangular box under the door and it collects water and salt from the road.  Then starts to blister and rust on the outside and under the box.  Costs $2000. to replace each one and get it installed and repainted and rust proofed.  It has a hole underneath for the water to come out but the auto body said the car is made that way to start rusting out so you have to buy a new car even though the engine is still good.  Also if you have the aluminum wheels on the car, they leak air and the wheels have to be sealed up before each winter otherwise you are at the gas station all the time filling up the tires.  If you own one, see your auto body shop and see if he can go in and seal up the inside of these boxes with something like tar or whatever they use.

mercury,milan,2010,Joe, 07/29/2010,300 miles and new transmission!,3,I am giving this car low scores only because after one week the transmission would not shift correctly.  i took it back to the dealer and they gave me excuses about why they could not download a program from Ford to test the transmission. After two days they finally decided that the car needed a new transmission. I purchased this car and drove it only 5 days. Now it has been in the shop for 7 days. I do like this car but I feel like its the same old bad Ford service. Before the trouble I would agree with the other positive reviews. 
mercury,milan,2010,Herb, 06/25/2009,great car,4,"This is a v6 fwd - not awd. Performance far exceeded expectations. Sync system is very good - hands free phone, and I have a cheap phone. Works with any bluetooth. Very quiet ride, and great stereo. I have auto climate, and fancy sony sound system. Driving in the city (Austin)stop and go at 100 degrees, AC working great - best I've ever had. Manuel shift mode is fun - but harder on mileage than auto. This car begs to accelerate too.  Too new for accurate mileage numbers. Have not taken highway trip yet."
mercury,milan,2010,ALAN HEBERT, 09/07/2009,Milan is better than Accord and Camry,5,"This is my 2nd Milan Premier (the previous being a V6).  I opted for the I4 and am extremely impressed with the 175 HP.  This is a great car for the money.  I test drove Accord and Camry.  America, we have a winner.  This car is extremely well appointed.  The Tuxedo Black Metallic paint is paired with the standard Camel leather interior.  I love the 9 speaker Sony sound system.  The MicroSoft Sync is awesome.  I am able to listed to my music via an Ipod or thumbdrive (via the USB port).  The Milan is very driver friendly.  "
mercury,milan,2010,Abbood, 12/16/2009,Amazing Even in the Most Basic Trim,4,"Have had the car for about 2 weeks after a couple of months of extensive research. I must say that I have zero regrets and I am extremely satisfied with my decision. The value I am getting from this car is great as it has extremely solid build and material quality and it is extremely fun to drive. It is extremely spacious and comfortable in the inside, and trunk space is great. I have had an Audi A4 followed by a Toyota Avalon in the past. Glad to go back to the mid-size as the Avalon was extremely not fun to drive. All in all, I definitely feel that I am in a MUCH MORE expensive car. "
mercury,milan,2010,New Mercury Owner, 01/19/2010,Just a few weeks old but I love it.,4,"I've only had it 3 weeks and so far so good.  Compared it to Malibu, Accord, Camary and it was the best.

mercury,milan,2010,mj816, 06/16/2011,I love my new 2010 Mercury Milan,4,"Overall, this is a great family car.
I traded in my SUV for better MPG.
It has a sleek interior (I have the two tone leather) and it is very luxurious.
I have the sync system and Sirius XM radio. My car comes with ambient lighting which I think my kids enjoy more than I do.
This car is the entire package and I'm sad that 2011 is the last year for Mercury."
mercury,milan,2010,winter2, 06/20/2011,First FoMoCo product in many years,4,"Purchase our 2010 Milan Premier as an executive car after my Jeep Liberty diesel lost a rod. Still fighting with Chrysler.

Overall, the Milan is surprisingly comfortable and quiet on the road.
Fuel economy is good getting in the upper 20's commuting and in the low 30's on long trips.

Engine power is adequate but lacks the torque of my Jeep (miss that).
Engine noise is very subdued while cruising.

Have had issues with Sync as the voice commands refused to work.
Three visits to the dealer plus a visit from a Ford engineer finally got it fixed (broken wire).


Fit and finish good be a bit better as some body panels are not aligned as well as they could be."

Wanted another Lincoln but base price had increased over $10,000 in 3 yrs. Milan is basically same car but way cheaper and with lots of bells/whistles. Good quality. So far, gets 31 mpg Hwy and 24 city. Voice Sync system is pretty neat but steep learning curve and can be distracting. Got Sirius for 2 years. Lot of car for the price."

 Ford Fusions and Mercury Milans 2010's suffer from bad transmissions.Looking to get rid of car. Would not recommend it."
mercury,milan,2010,gmarch, 10/30/2012,Lost love,4,"I have always been a Ford man and I loved my Milan Premier until recently. In the last three thousand miles (after it hit 50K miles) I had some kind of solenoid, a tail light, a throttle body, and a battery go bad, all common problems with this car. The one that really killed me was the tail light. Instead of replacing a bulb I had to replace the whole light assembly for $400. What kind of engineering is that? I am so turned off with Ford (and all American engineered cars). "
mercury,milan,2010,flyer, 02/19/2010,Replacement?,2,"Traded from 2000 Sable after a great 160,000+ miles. Dealer said this was the replacement for the Sable. Needed car with dual power seats due to wife's back condition. Had to get SYNC to get power seats. Car appears to be designed around ""entertainment system."" There are 3 different ways to adjust the volume of the system but it is impossible to operate any of the dash controls with winter gloves on. And forget completely about the steering wheel controls, they are way to small to use. However they are really easy to press accidentally while turning the wheel. The seats are narrow and the headrests protrude such that I will have to cut them off and move them back with spacers. Not worth $28K"
mercury,milan,2010,MilanBrandon, 09/30/2009,Poised to Revitalize the Mercury Brand,4,"Afer driving this highly satisfying Tuxedo Black vehicle for the past month, I am , firmly convinced that it is among the greatest cars I've ever driven. The V6 engine with optional AWD has plenty of power for my daily driving conditions and can pass slow- moving Toyota Priuses with ease.   On top of it all, the vehicle's exterior is quite eye-catching; especially after I purchased chrome Milan VOGA appliques, badges, and grille to replace the satin-aluminum accents (which were beautiful as well). The interior is the standard, charocal black.  It handles well on both the city and the highway.  With all of the added options, I feel like I'm driving a car that rivals most luxury brands."
mercury,milan,2010,Sara, 03/05/2010,"Nice car, but not a Subaru",4,"So far, at 6 months and 12,000 miles, this car is smooth, very comfortable, and has done well in ice and snow (I added X-Ice snows). It doesn't have the crisp responsive handling of my Subaru, but it's so comfortable you can forgive it for a lot.  What I don't like: after 6 months, I still have to look for climate controls. There are a lot of them, they all feel the same, I have to stretch to reach them.  Getting the free trial to Sirius radio reupped was a rude surprise.  The radio in the car will only accept Sirius most expensive plans.  You get a deal, but I would still pay for all the junk I don't want in order to hear the few stations I like.  It's a nice car, but next one is a Subaru."
mercury,milan,2010,JM, 04/26/2009,Nice Midsize Sedan,5,I have been impressed with my purchase  of my Milan Premier with the 202a package. It has a dueretic engine that gives the 4 cylinder a boost. The reason I gave  it a 9 in performance is due to the noise on a harder accelleration. Build quality I gave a 9 only because fingerprints are more noticeable due to their finish on the dash area. The sound system is top notch and I love the video camera for backing up as well as the blind spot indicator in the sideview mirror. Unless it is extremely windy the ride is quiet. Fun to drive I really could not rate. I have mainly driven in city and have had 27 mpg so far. I'm not a lead foot. I am extremely pleased with my purchase.
mercury,milan,2010,FlaMilkman, 05/24/2009,Exceeded My Expectations,4,"I am extremely impressed with the 2010 Milan 6cycl.  The exterior is sharp and the leather seats are as comfortable as sitting in your favorite sofa at home.  Acceration is peppy and the brakes and steering are solid.  I love the Synch feature - much easier to program and use than the one on my Mazda.  My biggest complaint is regarding the size of the buttons on the center console for the radio and A/C - they are too small and too far for easy reach.   I have gotten around 25mph on the highway (around 75mph on flat terrain) and around 20 in city driving.  This may increase as the engine breaks in better (have around 1,000 miles so far).  "

Everyone taken for a ride is astonished by all the electronic gadgetry. Owned for three weeks and getting 29mpg combo city/hwy so far. Impressed with the peppy 4 cyl and acceleration.

It feels solid, strong and responsive.  There's a touch of engine noise, but to my ears, it's a nice throttle growl not a straining sound.  With the radio going it's hardly noticeable, and does not impede conversation at all. After the ""Cash for Clunkers"" program, it took a long time to get this car, but I am glad I waited.  The color is Smokestone, and it is beautiful.  I am a very proud and happy owner."

mercury,milan,2010,New Jersey, 12/23/2009,Feels like a Luxury Car,5,"I traded in my 2005 BMW 3 series and the Milan is a much better ride. My biggest reason for test driving the Milan was because of its top reliability from Consumer Reports. I still cannot believe all the pluses that I did not expect.  Most people think I paid over $30K. I paid $23K. The Milan's less power than my BMW took some getting used to, but I chose the 4 cyl. because I wanted better gas mileage. Go with a 6 cyl. if that matters to you. The drive is smooth and the storage is huge. The test drive was better than the Camry and Accord with alot more features. The Altima was a sportier ride but Consumer Reports said its reliability was only average."
mercury,milan,2010,Robert, 12/24/2009,Buying American Again,4,"Have owned 2 Honda Accords in the last decade. Both were very reliable. Test drove Sonata, Fusion and Milan. All were nice quiet ride. The Fusion and Milan had the better combination of ride and comfort. I opted for the Milan because it had the best combination of options that I was looking for. The 2.5 liter engine matched with the 6 speed automatic works well. I have put on over 1000 miles in the first week. Mileage was acceptable at 29.6 mpg. Interstate driving at 65-80 mph with AC on for a majority of the trip. Because of time constraints I was unable to get Sync functional, but am looking forward to it. Overall a very nice car. Hope initial quality continues."

And this is the car to be in when you are in bumper to bumper traffic!  The sound system is amazing and the seats are so comfortable!  This car will definitely win some awards.

I selected tuxedo black with a camel interior,   which I feel not only is a classic color combination, but also brightens the interior.  The car is loaded with every option except navigation, which I declined, having just received a GPS for Christmas.  I traded a 1996 Mustang GT, desiring a more refined ride, while at the same time, not wanting to give up performance and handling.  While I realize comparing a Mustang to a Milan may be like apples to oranges, the former being rear drive and the latter front, the Milan's handling does NOT disappoint!  In addition, the Milan's ride is so serene!"
mercury,milan,2010,John, 01/02/2010,Great Car for the Price,4,"I've always been a Chevy man, but after they took bailouts from us, I decided to go with the only American manufacturer that didn't take our money.  So, looking for a car I decided to try the Merc Milan.  I still compared it to the Chevy Malibu, but the Milan was nicer.  Plus, the Mercury dealerships are so much more professional than most others.  They actually let me take a Milan out and try it for part of a day.  I thought it was a great car for the money; it now in my garage.Especially surprising is the city gas mileage.  So far, in town only, I'm getting over 24 mpg."
mercury,milan,2010,meinschaft, 01/30/2010,My Third Milan,4,"This is my third Milan, having previously leased a 2006 and 2008 version.  It put 100,000 absolutely trouble-free miles on the first two.  The only service they needed were regular oil changes and tire rotations.  My 2010 is FWD (NOT AWD) and benefits from the extra 20 HP and the selectable transmission.  I was very happy with the previous models but the 2010 has numerous improvements and refinements - quite impressed that Ford is doing this instead of their former practice of making it cheaper (i.e., deleting content) every year.  These are great cars - the Milan? Fusion - and I can recommend them w/o reservation.  "
mercury,milan,2010,Jim Famula, 02/07/2010,Milan MPG 22 Combined. Real Good Car1,5,Milan 4 Cylinder MPG is outstanding! Solid feel is way above expectations. This car feels much more expensive.
mercury,milan,2010,zogu, 02/24/2010,nice car,5,"Dependable, comfortable, plenty of room. My advice:  You absolutely must get the BLIS blind spot detector and the rear camera.  The rear camera is a good idea on any car, but especially this one which has a high back end.  Mercury Milan vs Ford Fusion:  I looked at them both...the Ford's styling and options seemed more aimed at males under 35..the Mercury towards females over 35.   Me - male over 35 - I prefer safety and comfort over sportiness and nice sound systems.  Also  the Lincoln-Mercury salesman was older and less aggressive than the Ford guy - they seem to be accustomed to dealing with a different demographic."
mercury,milan,2010,Charley, 02/25/2010,Great car,5,Have only owned the car for two months.Put 1000 miles on car and then took off for Flordia and drove it hard and still got 30 miles per gallon. It was a great ride and really like the trunk room. The I4 has plenty of power. Love the two tone leather seats and they are heated.Over all I am quite pleased with the car.
mercury,milan,2010,jege, 03/15/2010,Very Pleased!,4,"Got my Sterling Gray I-4 Premier 012210 after trading my 2008 Mariner Premier. With approx. 1500 miles, all is great. I had  a 2005 Mazda6 (the base for this car) before my Mariner and I'm enjoying the same feeling the Mazda had. Great ride/handling with excellent brakes and very quiet. Fuel economy in town is about 24mpg so far. Fit & finish is comparable to imports. Leather is luxury car quality."
mercury,milan,2010,Frank, 03/24/2010,Frank,4,"I traded in a 2000 Lincoln LS for this Milan. The Milan is a great car. It is comfortable, gas mileage is good (27 - 30 mpg) highway. The Sync system is a  great value, as is the 202A package, which includes the back-up camera feature and the blind spot light on the side view mirror. These are huge safety features."
mercury,milan,2010,Mike, 04/01/2010,First American Car in 16 Years,4,"We picked up our new Milan about 2 weeks ago.  So far things have been just fine.  For the past 16 years we have driven Toyotas but we thought it was time for a change.  The car has a good ride, much more controlled then the Toyota  and feels more sporty.  The engine is very quiet and the automatic trans shifts very well. Mileage is about 23.5 so far with mostly suburban driving.   So far no squeaks or rattles and the leather seats are very comfortable.  The trunk seems to be about the same size of the Camry as well as the rear seat.  The Sony sound system is great.  The only problem is trying to get our older phone to hook up with the Sync system. The interior lighting is a nice touch.  "
mercury,milan,2010,Tony, 08/11/2010,Comfortable and excellent handeling car,4,"Car has been flawless during the first 4500 miles.

mercury,milan-hybrid,2010,captainkey, 02/19/2013,"Traded the Prius for this, and am soooo glad!",5,"I had a 2011 Prius.
That da** car had the absolutely worst seats you could put in a car.

I saw this car on the Richmond BMW lot, pulled in, took it for a test drive and traded on the spot, which I have never done before.

It is far superior to the Prius except in the gas mileage.

The shifting is much smoother, it is a lot quieter, and the leather seats are like heaven. I could drive this all day and not get tired.

I average about 38 mpg, and I have a lead foot.

I have never owned an America built car."
mercury,milan-hybrid,2010,Hybrid fan, 04/26/2010,A Keeper,5,"This car is a no-compromise hybrid. We owned a Ford Fusion 6-cylinder SEL before this one, loved it, but this is even better.  The hybrid powertrain is awesome -- imperceptible if you don't want to think about it (though you'll notice going 600 miles on a tank!) but the Eco-Guide display helps you hypermile if you want>  I got 99.9 mpg on one trip! (Okay, it was a short downhill trip, but I've also had longer trip in the high 40s and 50s. Very well-appointed, classy car. Some friends with a BMW were drooling over it.  Plan to keep this one for a good long time.  I hear the batteries last more or less forever."
mercury,milan-hybrid,2010,MB, 03/27/2010,"Great Car, the right decision!!!",5,"Had a 2007 Lincoln MKZ that my wife hated, poor turning radius, difficult to judge for parking,etc.  Looked at the Fusion Hybrid, the new MKZ, and fell in love with this elegant, understated, very European styled tuxedo black Milan Premier Hybrid.  Have over 1200 miles on the car and we are averaging 38 MPG, just amazing, never expected it to be so good. Price was right, and the reviews sold us."
mercury,milan-hybrid,2010,pooderbill, 02/21/2010,"Awsome - a real treat, fun to demo",5,"After several years with Saturns (which had great mileage), the demise of Saturn sent me looking for a more luxurious car. The Milan hybrid is by far the nicest car I have ever been in. Performance is amazing - acceleration in the 25-40 range is very surprising. Freeway mileage is about 36 but in town, I can get 42 to 58 if I watch the EV indicator. The dash reminds me when the electric motor is running and I tend to take advantage of that when I can. I love giving a demo in silent electric mode, showing the power flow on the screen and of course all the Sync features. Passengers can't tell when the gas engine kicks in. I have nitrogen in the tires which may kick in an extra 2-3 MPG."
mercury,milan-hybrid,2010,pregomio, 09/19/2011,The Lone Star in my Texas Garage,5,"Got the car fully loaded except for DVD player who needs it, had remote start added by Mercury dealer who did not install the antenna so drove it a years till I had it serviced at a Ford Dealer nearer my home who fixed problem beware WestPoint Lincoln/Mercury dealership in Houston, TX, the car is great the dealership needs to be looked at by Ford or HPD bunko squad. I will not go near the place again for anything!"
mercury,milan-hybrid,2010,rpp, 05/22/2010,Best Hybrid in the price range,5,"One professional auto reviewer had it right.  This is the first hybrid to drive like a regular car.  It is also clearly superior to the Ford Fusion Hybrid, Camry Hyrbid, Lexus HS250, Prius, and Altima Hybrid if you compare carefully. I really wanted to like the Lexus, but it was noisy and didn't drive as well as the Milan. The only advantage of the Lexus was the interior leather IMHO.  I have a 2004 Mercedes E320 and I replaced a 1998 Infiniti Q45 with the Milan Hybrid. I've had the Milan for about 3 weeks now, and I am pretty satisfied.  Averaging over 36 MPG with the A/C running, but have gotten over 46 going to work.  As expected, mileage is very dependent on the terrain."
mercury,milan-hybrid,2010,Mac, 05/25/2010,Concerns due to breakdown,4,This is a nice car but unfortunately left us stranded after running well when we stopped for a snack.  It would not start and gave us various error messages.
mercury,milan-hybrid,2010,Tony, 04/07/2009,Milan Hybrid,5,Looks like I will be getting 600 miles on my first tank of gas.  I am averaging around 32 mpg with around 41 mpg on short trips.  I love the car so far.  The technology in this car is amazing.  I can go electric mode (EV) at 47 mph for about a mile.  The change from EV to gas hardly noticed.  I have plenty of power on the highways and it is a joy not using any gas or putting carbon in the air while under 47 mph or at stop lights.  You can run the air while in EV mode also.  So I do not feel guilty waiting on someone to come to the car while I sit with the air running!  The car is very quiet and comfortable to ride in.
mercury,milan-hybrid,2010,Wally, 05/05/2009,So fun to drive and thrifty on gas too!!,4,"This is a great car, really feels good and solid to drive.  It has good acceleration and firm road handling.  So far im getting about 48MPG in light traffic and about 44 with some canyon driving.  So impressed with this car it does everything but the dishes...."
mercury,milan-hybrid,2010,Bill Palermo, 06/01/2009,Ford/Mercury Greatest Achiement,5,When I first turn the ignition key on I expected to hear the gas engine come to life.  Instead the EV System quietely allopwed me to drive at a in city speed of 30 mph.  When accelerating the engine seamlessly engages without labor or hesitation. The ecvt transmission is smooth and don't expect to feel any shifting.  The enterior design is elegant and the leather seats are very comfortable.  Air climate control is quick and responsive to weather conditions.  Steering is very agile and responsive. Outside noises are at a minimum.  Great engineering job by Ford's Engineers.
mercury,milan-hybrid,2010,Wayne, 06/01/2009,Outstanding Performance,5,"The Mercury Milan Hybrid has proven to be every thing I had hoped for.  The hybrid system is working flawlessly and I am getting around 39 mpg with a combination of highway/city driving.  The handling is excellent, plenty of power and a pleasure to drive.  Road noise is minimal.  The blind spot detector is fantastic.  It took several days of driving before I got the technique of putting it into electric mode whenever speeds are below 47 mph.  Now it is just second nature.  The interior is well done and the seats quite comfortable.  The voice activated Sync works very well."
mercury,milan-hybrid,2010,Dave Hansen, 07/08/2009,2010 Mercury Milan Hybrid,4,"I bought this car because I need a vehicle towable behind my motorhome.  I've been looking for 3 years for a car with all the features I've grown accustomed to.  This one has it all.  It's beautiful, platinum white tricoat, great looking interior, sync with nav, great handling, comfortable. I've always  been a GM person, but they couldn't sell me anything like this car.  The average mpg displayed is 39.9 for 1150 miles. All short trips and fast freeway runs. I haven't yet been able to verify this number with fuel used.   "
mercury,milan-hybrid,2010,twkeki, 07/10/2009,2010 Mercury Milan Hybrid,5,"Ford should have made this car 5 years ago! The 2010 Milan Hybrid is more quiet than Jaguar and is Germanic in road feel and handling. For first 800 miles, we are averaging 37.5 mpg in San Francisco, which is amazing. We find good power on freeways. This car can run in EV mode up to around 45 miles per hour, which is great in slow, heavy urban traffic.  Seriously this is a fine 4-door sedan. Mr. Obama should use stimulus funds to put a couple million on the road.  So I just hope it does not fall apart like my last Ford."
mercury,milan-hybrid,2010,Bill Palermo, 07/21/2009,Ergonomic Flaw on seating,4,"On my first review I was to hasty to rate the interior design a 10.  I have to go back and rate the seating a 4. It is very uncomfortable for petite drivers or passengers if their height is 5'3"" or under.  Once you are seated into the plush leather seating and settle back you will notice the headrest will push your head forward.  Long trips will put you into misery and a maybe even a visit to the chiropractor office.  When you try out the seating make sure you are not wearing a winter coat, that's what it takes to keep your head from being pushed forward.  I wrote to the Ford / Mercury Customer Service Department explaining what I feel is a flawed design on their leather seating package."
mercury,milan-hybrid,2010,DJ, 07/20/2009,finally,5,"Never had an american car. In this economy wanted great gas mileage,and american. My family wanted a comfortable back seat. My lease on my bmw 3 coupe was up. It was in the shop a lot. I had a tough time deciding betwen the fusion hybrid and the milan. the Milan seemed a little more plush and you dont see as many around. I felt this made a thoughtful statement for the times. its a real car. Its engaging and handsome. very few compromises. Considered the new lexus 250hs,but much more $ comparably equipped. write ups excellent as per car and driver, best hybrid on the market today"
mercury,milan-hybrid,2010,G'Pa, 08/22/2009,"Darn good, but not perfect",4,"After three months and the completion of a 2200 mile road trip I am now comfortable with my feelings on this vehicle. Love the mileage, as high as 60 in short (5-10mi) urban trips per computer. I have validated computer calculations on the road trip, so Yahoo! Nice interior and lots of compliments on the exterior styling. Unfortunately there are some missed cues in this car.  Headrests- designers...what were you thinking? My wife and I both have to recline the seatback excessively to find a comfortable position for our neck. No Homelink-no memory seats. These are standard items in this price category. "
mercury,milan-hybrid,2010,gr1nst3r, 08/27/2009,Need more cars like this!,5,"I bought this car because a) I wanted a 30+ MPG hybrid with leather seats & moonroof b) in bad economic times, I wanted to buy american c) I wanted to tell these american car makers what they are doing right (MHO).  If this is you, this car is it!  This is not a sports car but rather a smooth cuiser.  It has plenty of power for me when I want it.  I happen to like the Mercury stying.  This car is loaded with terrific technology.  Unless I gun it, I have to check the dash to see if the engine is running - it's seamless.  I'm getting 38MPG combined, 48-50 on my 15 mi trip to work if I take the back roads.  I'll get 600 mi/tank.  This while sacrificing nothing."
mercury,milan-hybrid,2010,Art, 09/27/2009,Great Car,5,"We have had it three weeks and went to the highest peak on the east coast with out a problem. Good pick-up, excellant features and we are averaging 4o miles to the gallon. It is nice to see such a solid, well built, American car. Memory for the drivers seat would have been nice but it is what it is,,,,,still impressed."

mercury,milan-hybrid,2010,Kurt, 12/03/2009,The Comparatively Better Hybrid,4,"I have now had the car for a little over four months. I previously had a Buick Lucerne. Although the Lucerne had much more room, I like the handling of the Milan much better. I am experiencing an average of 36.4 mpg. Nice, but not quite what they are advertising. But it is almost 20 mpg more than I got in the Lucerne. And I do mostly city driving.  And I am being very cautious with my driving habits -  trying to get the best mileage I can.  "
mercury,milan-hybrid,2010,Mike47, 12/10/2009,SUPERB AUTOMOBILE,4,"My wife & I were very hesitant in purchasing an American car, though my Toyota Solara has a greater percentage of parts from the US. This was my first American car since my 1990 Ford Taurus SHO and based on Consumer Reports reliability and Motor Trend's nomination for the Fusion & Milan as COY, the Milan has more than exceeded our expectations.....Ford should advertise the Mercury Milan more, since it is a better deal money-wise and options than the Fusion. The car is solid and though we live in the snow-belt the mileage is still very good and the car has performed great these past 10 weeks. Delivery time was nearly 12 weeks but did manage to get the $1,700 Federal Tax Credit for 2009."
mercury,milan-hybrid,2010,Mike, 12/28/2009,Best Value of any Hybrid,5,"Ford has finally gotten it right. My last Ford was a 1990 Taurus SHO and have owned 3 foreign cars before my Milan...was hesitant to buy American but CR says it is reliable & well- made. My only concern will be its resale value in 3-5 years since most American cars really fail that category. Got a great deal and with the Federal tax credit and sales tax deduction an even better deal...better handling & road feel than a 2009 Accord & seats better than a Camry, however front headrests take some getting use to. Have had no issues with the car and mileage is down because of winter cold but still better than my V-6 Accord. The sound system is excellent & the Milan is a better deal than the Fusion!"
mercury,milan-hybrid,2010,Deb, 01/31/2010,Love My New Milan Hybrid,4,I have had my new Milan Hybrid for about 3 weeks now and I love it.  It's replacing a '03 Acura TL (which I loved) and I wanted to buy an American hybrid this time.  This is my first American car since the early 80s and I am very impressed.  The interior is contemporary and comfortable; I love the styling.  I drive about 200 miles a day and the Milan is very comfortable.  I love the integrated BlueTooth and the free 3-month subscription to Sirius radio.  The seats could be a tad cushier but other than that no complaints.  Most of my daily driving is highway 65-75 mph and I am getting 34-35 MPG which is great.
mercury,milan-hybrid,2010,Ted Kollar, 02/11/2010,Concerned about MPG,4,"Overall we love the car. I have always bought American and usually Ford. The biggest selling point was the advertised mileage. Sadly, as of yet, we have been unable to experience over 28 MPG. (This car has only been over 40 MPH for about 200 of the 1300 miles logged. Dealership say's it's the cold weather. I will check back in when the weather warms up. As I said, in general, we love the car. "
mercury,milan-hybrid,2010,carl, 05/04/2010,Awesome,5,"One week into ownership I could not be happier.  My white Mercury Milan's profile reminds me of a C Class Mercedes.  Gas mileage is phenomenal.  I expected a drop from my Focus, but no.  Some trip numbers have been so astonishing, not sure I believe them myself.  First fill up will verify - or not.  I should add, I am a totally disciplined hypermiler. So many systems to go wrong.  Still, they are all working as advertised.  My luck can't last on flawless performance.  Considering getting the Extracare Extended Service Plan, as repair on some of these systems, especially the electronics, must be very expensive."
mercury,milan-hybrid,2010,Topekan, 09/08/2010,Reformed Honda Owner,5,"I've owned a Mustang, a Taurus, and 5 Honda's (Accords & a CRX). This time I chose the Mercury Milan and I'm glad I did. No Honda ever had the same ""substantial"" sound I hear when I close the door of my new Milan.  I regularly get 38 mph and I tend to accelerate a little rapidly from a complete stop. The fit and finish well exceed my last Honda (2005 Accord.  The technology behind the accessories, safety options, and advanced hybrid system have no equal in Honda products.  This car could be the start of a new series with Ford Motor products!"
mercury,montego,2005,Abrahim Yousif, 11/25/2015,Very reliable have lot of pros and cons,5,"I own a 2005 Mercury Montego Premier FWD V6, I bought it in 2014 with 160K miles and as of today 11/25/15 I have 178,139 Miles on the odometer. I will talk about all good and bad stuff about the car, but first let me talk about good stuff and everything I'm mentioning comes from my personal experience with this car. I love the huge trunk size you can loaded with many many stuff, The car is a full size sedan which is very rare to find a sedan with the same size as this car now, a 6.1 guy can comfortably sit in any seat, for a 2005 car the interior looks nice and so classic,wish if they had auxiliary jack but it's missing it, Xenon lights and fog lights, visibility in this car is excellent and this is so critical, the tires are big enough to give you a good traction and ride quality of this car is something you will love, back up parking sensors are very helpful and one of my favorite features in this car, even I bought this car 9 years old with 160K miles but it has been a trouble free car as of today the only thing I ever changed is oil and I had to change one of the oxygen sensors which is not a big deal, the car takes me from 0-60 mph in 7 seconds. Now let me talk about the bad stuff, Brakes! yes brakes in this car are not as good as they should be in and they are really not good even though I changed the brakes they are still not good, the rear doors collects water if you wonder how! when it rains the water goes down inside the rear door and as I was told this is the way the car was designed, so when you drive in winter after rain you can hear the water when you stop the car or turn.

mercury,montego,2005,Dave Croft, 04/12/2010,2005 Montego Premier AWD CVT,5,"This is probably the last car I'll ever need to buy. I like everything about it. I've had dozens of cars and trucks before. This one's a keeper. It's comfortable and fun to drive. I've found the 3.0 liter to have plenty enough power for my needs and the gas mileage is amazing for this class of vehicle. Average 23-24 local driving and on a long trip using cruise control this thing jumps up to an average of 32-33 mpg. Since 2007 I've driven it 40,000 miles. I bought it with 23,000 on it for a total of 63,000 miles. It runs like new. The Montego is built like a tank, rugged. The AWD coupled with Traction control and the CVT transmission work together allow the car to walk over any ice or snow."
mercury,montego,2005,Stan Dieckmann, 09/11/2015,Best Car Ever,5,"I bought my 2005 in 2009, it had 48K miles and had been a one owner car.  It now has 162,000 and I took it to a shop to go through it front to back, to let me know their thoughts on if I should keep it or sell it.  I like the car SO much, I am going to spend about $3,000 on it to make it ""new"" again.  I have searched and searched for a car that I would like equally well, both new and used, and I can't find it.
My wife's 2013 Ford Edge has all the new techno gadgets that I don't have, and I wish I did have, but I can add that after market.  The car is such a good car.  I take it to Ford for every service at 5,000 miles, change the transmission oil at 50,000, and what a car!  
I can't think of any other car that I have looked at and researched that I am more willing to spend money on right now than the car I have.  And I have the money and or credit to buy any car I want.  Just so you know, I don't want a 7 Series BMW, I can't buy that, but I can buy a nice car.  I like this car so much, I have looked at 2009's, both Ford and Mercury, to see if I could find the right one with low miles so I could stay with basically the same car, and I can't.  
So another $3,000 and many more miles...here I come.

I have the FWD version and it did great during a snow storm.  One issue I do have is that when I switch the vent from upper to lower, I hear a noise as the hoses switch over.  I'm now in the market for a new vehicle and find myself comparing everything to this car.

mercury,montego,2005,Randy99, 06/23/2009,2005 Mercury Montego AWD,5,"I picked up my Mercury Montego AWD last March from a wholesaler in Florida. I read a few reviews from here and noticed folks really seemed to like the vehicle, and now I know why.  I quickly found the car to be very suitable and probably the most room I've had for a medium size car for my 6' 5"" body. I travel extensively on business trips and have already put on 15K miles in just these past few months.  It handles just fine and has plenty enough power for my needs, although it is a bit sporty and some buyers might feel as though the car should fly for the way it looks.  The gas mileage was the real surprise with trips getting 25 to 29 mph. One issue with the instrument gauges going off."
mercury,montego,2005,chrisg05, 08/26/2015,Dont believe all the hype about this car.,3,"I normally dont write reviews butJust like the title says. Dont believe all the hype about this car. There is a reason why these cars did not sell well when new. You will see many of them with low miles for the year. Think twice before you buy. I am an actual owner for 4 years and just traded out of it yesterday. 

Pluses: 
Roomy comfortable ride. The trunk is huge and you can easily haul 3 adults in the rear of the car. The ride itself is very acceptable for a big American car.
safety ratings are 5 star for the year
excellent handling for a large car

Negatives:
Gas millage: Dont believe what you are told. Real world numbers are more like 17 in the city 25 on the highway. I did a 300 mile trip, all highway.. all at posted speeds of 65 to 70mph and got between 23-to 25 on the highway. Combined we were lucky to get 19mpg. 

Brakes: They just plain suck. Replaced the rear brakes (rotors, pads) twice on this car in 30K! Yes twice both times pads were down to the rivets. Yes the correct ""modified"" pads were used from ford the first time (lasted 14k) and the second time Raybestos pads were used. Both sets ceramic material. Sorry but that was unacceptable.

Door seals: Rear doors collect water on the bottom of them due to poor design. The door is designed to let the water go through the window seal and out the bottom end of the door. The problem with this is when the door seal blocks the drain hole, water collects in the door. You dont know until you hear it as you open and close the door. This causes the door to rust from the inside out. If you see rust bubbles run. Also the seal, by the seat tends to come off the metal. The only fix is to get a new one at a higher cost. 

Air conditioning does not work properly. This is a common problem on the montego/five hundred/freestyle. There is a problem with the compressor that is used on these cars where when you idle you get warm air. Not fun in 90 degree humid weather. In there defense, when you run the engine above 1500 rpm the car blows out ice cold. Only fix so far from ford is a new compressor at the cost of 500 dollars. 

Engine stalling/stumbling when starting. Another common problem... was told to clean maf sensor and throttle body. 6 months later same issue. The engine itself is good and powerful once it is running right. Got really tired of that issue.

Transmission clunks and hunts sometimes for gears.

Cv axles at 56k.

You may think I am being critical on this car... well yes I am. This is why foreign offerings are doing so well here.

mercury,montego,2005,stevec81, 06/19/2014,A Mercury? for all ages?,4,"I bought this as an used car while looking for a variety of mid-size sedans.
 While not initially on up for consideration, I was sold on it after driving it.


While Mercury is generally associated as a car for ""old people"", I was pleasantly surprised by this.
Although the Montego is also a full-size car with large trunk, the similarities with the Grand Marquis end right about there.


Although not sporty or fast, the Montego drives light on its feet and feels well-connected to the road.
While understated, it still looks like something special."
mercury,montego,2005,Linwood Farmer, 03/29/2005,Montego,4,"drives well. very comfortable. looks very nice. taillights can be seen from far away, good safety feature"
mercury,montego,2005,C. L. Marshall, 12/31/2005,Molto Bene,4,"The Montego is well thought out, excellant vision all around, forward, backing, lots of storage compartments, ease of entry/exit, leg room for rear seating is supurb, better than Town Car, trunk space plus fold down seats provides great carrying capacity, pick- up is more than adequate, CVT is great in conjunction with traction control, AWD.  Air intake below windshield is designed so that leaves and debris are not sucked in.  Braking feels effortless and comfortable. Trunk hinges are designed so they don't intrude into trunk space.  Near chair height seats are comfortable and provide good forward view.  The designers of the vehicle were careful in covering most all details."
mercury,montego,2005,clifford morse, 08/21/2005,one of the best cars I have ever owned,5,"The 2005 Mercury Montego has it all; style (inside and out), roomy interior, comfort, economy, safety, enormous trunk, handles well on the road, a pleasure to drive with its quiet ride and ease of handling, has power when needed.  It is an all around GREAT car.  I am proud to be an owner."
mercury,montego,2005,Sandy, 06/22/2006,Noisy start,4,"I love my 05 Montego but it has a loud hesitant start. I just recently experienced another loud noise when steering left or backing up. I took it to the dealership and they told me the strut bearing on the drivers side needed complete replacement. I though this was a little unusual at 22,710 mi."
mercury,montego,2005,nobigdl, 08/31/2010,You get what you pay for,3,"This car seemed like a good deal, but after getting used to it I find many annoying items. Like the 2-zone air conditioning is really confusing and doesn't keep the settings when turned off. A/C has already needed major repair. At midday (high sun angle), the glare on the speedo is so bad you can't read it. Poor design foresight throughout. The information display is fairly useless and very confusing when trying to reset oil change interval. Dash board surface is bubbling. Light dash color glares horribly. Seat bottoms are too short and seats are too hard. Interior quality feels like a rental car. If you find dumb design annoying, don't buy this car. "
mercury,montego,2005,Jean Clubine, 03/23/2009,Best car I ever had,4,"I bought this car because a I wanted a larger car with front wheel drive. This is one of the few that had it besides GM. Bought it new with 200 miles on it.  It is definitely the most trouble free and dependable car I have ever had.  I previously had a Cadillac Deville and it has all the bells and whistles I had on the Cadillac.  I got the Premier because I wanted the leather seats and then got other options, too.  I had always wanted a Mercury but had never had one. I shouldn't have waited so long to get one.  "
mercury,montego,2005,John Wiktor, 02/16/2005,Mercury Montego Premium,4,The Montego rides comfortably and quiet with a well designed interior and large trunk capacity.  Much quieter ride than my previous Lincoln LS.  Good visibility with its higher seat confiduration with ample room in the back.  Very pleased with the vehicle.
mercury,montego,2005,Scott, 04/01/2005,New Montego,4,All in all i would say this a very good vehicle.Slightly underpowered but not sluggish at all.
mercury,montego,2005,Margaret Fitzgerald, 05/18/2005,Best Car I've Ever Owned,4,"This is my 9th car and I can say that it it truly the best I've ever owned.  The amenities are great, it feels good and I look good in it.  It is a joy to pull up in the gas station and someone asks about my car. All my cars have been Ford/Mercury, except for one drastic mistake I made when I was much younger.  But since then been grown I stay in the Ford/Mercury line!"
mercury,montego,2005,Dave, 07/27/2005,New Montego,4,"So far I have been very pleased with this car. I have read many reviews about the ""under-sized"" engine being the Achilles heel of the vehicle. This is not an accurate statement. I have had no problems accelerating into highway traffic and certainly no problems accelerating IN highway traffic. Unless you are Mario Andretti or you are going for a new quarter mile record, the engine power is appropriate. This is the most comfortable car I have ever ridden in. The high seating helps prevent your forward view from being totally obstructed by SUVs and small trucks. The car is also very well equipped even at the entry level. "
mercury,montego,2005,Jim Wells, 09/15/2006,Proof in the Pudding,4,"I finally got to take a 3000-mile drive through Wa, Idaho, Montana and Oregon with my 2005 Premier AWD.  This is a great long-trip car in the Ford tradition.  Comfort and 27-mpg over every type of rural and urban terrain with the CVT tranny.  The Duratec V-6 performed more than adequately throughout the trip.  It's a little slow at the get-go, but is fine at higher speeds, so don't be put off by hot rod auto magazine editors.  A very civilized car with great content, quality and comfort for the money.  Nothing so wrong with ""modern maturity"" as one reviewer wrote.  "
mercury,montego,2005,William Parris, 08/12/2005,Mercuey Montego Engineering improvments,4,One of the best handling automobiles I have ever driven. The way this  transmission and revolutions of the engine work together is really great. This gives you the horse power you need and keeps the engine RPM turning where your most HP is generated. You never feel or hear any shifing inside the car. 
mercury,montego,2005,Meo, 07/01/2009,Could Be Better!,3,Negatives 1.Windshield glare from front dash area (have tan interior) 2.Perreille tires good for 24k thats it 3.Rear door panels hold water 4.Service Bulletin rear disc brakes 5.Transmission rough when cold 6 HID front head lights heat to intense for internal yellow turn signal materials 7.Paint quality could be upped a notch 8.Rear bumper needs top external flange so to not scratch the bumper when raising the trunk. 9.Side Mirrors too larger can block visability 10. AC Weak (car is black)
mercury,montego,2005,jdesir, 10/15/2004,"Looks good, but not so fast",4,"I am happy with it, but it is now my
wife's car.  The lack of get up and go
after pushing the accelerator just
wasn't worth it.  I need more power than
that, and with it coming with Pirelli
Tires and 18"" rims, I was deceived at
first sight.  The Montego is a nice
vehicle to look at and is ultra roomy. 
I've never been in a Ford/Mercury
vehicle with this many features for such
a low price.  The price was obviously
put into the interior/exterior over the
performance.  I was told that the AWD
model has even less torque.  The wife,
who doesn't mind the lack of power,
enjoys it though, as will many that
don't have a huge need for horsepowers."
mercury,montego,2005,StBonas1984, 10/15/2008,Solid car,4,I love this car and I had the usual problems that most have mentioned. I replaced the front strut mounts (ext warranty) after about 35000 miles. The auto down window regulator broke and that was also covered by my extended warranty. I had the bubbles in the dash compartnemtn lid and the dealer popped a new one in it. The interior is wearing on the door handle and the shifterknow is peeling. Mileage is great and I am getting those mid twenties also. Ride is great and I love the large door. The only problem with this car is that Ford and Mercury never marketed this car correctly. My kids have trashed the bumpers and body panels with scratches and dings but what can you expect with teenagers. 
mercury,montego,2005,Lawrence, 06/20/2009,2005 Mercury Montego,4,"We have been totally satisfied with our Montego.  Driving at 65 MPH on an interstate, we have gotten 31.5 MPG.  At 70 MPH, it goes down to 27 MPG.  City driving makes it go down to 25 MPG.  The height of the seats make getting in and out of the car extremely easy.  We are both tall, so the more than ample length seats are a plus.  Like all Ford products, the car corners fantastically.  The 5-star safety rating is yet another plus.  "
mercury,montego,2005,Better Fords, 10/20/2005,Mercury Montego is best in class...,4,"I'm a long-time car enthusiast, reading everything automotive & owning too many cars.  For the 1st time ever, I had to buy a car for comfort over sportiness.  After 3 mo. of research & test drives, the Montego w/employee discount + $1000 won me over.  The ""underpowered"" blather in reviews is off- base...horsepower ratings are over- emphasized.  It's funny, too, that the new SAE  methodology for rating HP (stricter w/independent observer req'd) dropped the Camry's base V-6 from 210 to 190 HP, a car often compared to the Montego.  Honda didn't rate the Accord V-6, but their other engines that have been rated dropped.  I'm getting high 20's for mpg, many compliments, & riding in comfort & style."
mercury,montego,2005,rizcpa, 06/01/2006,Not all of us like SUV's,4,"The car is absolutly wonderful in the snow.  Have had nothing but good to say about it.  Caught the gravel once and the car pulled right out of it.  Worst snow of the year and drove right through it, the all wheel drive is great! Plenty of room in the back for my teenage boys, more room in the car and trunk than in most of the SUV's on the market. Sits a little higher than other cars but lower than a truck. The only problem I have is reaching over the window sill at the bank and the ATM's. Going to sell the 2005 and buy a new one.  I haven't found another car on the market today that handles this well in the snow and rain, and the safety features are really comforting."
mercury,montego,2005,Michael Schenker, 02/24/2005,Too much money for Too little power!,3,"This is a nice car but IT IS PAINFULLY underpowered. It's one thing if the Premier AWD model is under $25,000. It's another when it's close to or over $30,000 fully loaded. For that amount of coin, I should be getting a V-8 with close to 300 hp. Or at least a much more powerful V-6....maybe supercharged. Don't pay $28-30,000 for Premier AWD model. Realistically, it's worth the $24-26,000 range and supply will catchup with demand and resale value WILL plummet. The price won't go down on these but you will be able to get them cheaper with rebates in a few years. "
mercury,montego,2005,StewartFan, 03/16/2005,Likin' it,4,"I traded my Lincoln LS in for a roomier car and I got it!  It's only 6"" longer but has ever so much more room.  I went for the Premier AWD because my Lincoln was soooo bad in snow.  I got used to all the nice amenities though so I went for it in the Montego.  I have not been disappointed and with the CVT transmission, I don't find any lack of power when I need it.  So far, I think it's a great car for the money!"
mercury,montego,2005,Mr. Heckmann, 03/23/2005,Comparison to Aviator,5,"Main reason to switch from the Aviator was to get a high performance car that would get me more miles per gallon.   Montego does just that from 10 mph to 21 mph city and 27 mph.  Just the way one drives gets that.  I did not want to give up many extras but are satisified with what the features have.  The seating is quite comofortable and like the way the recliner is at best.  Even my gas station asks me where I've been so this definitely was a solid decision I made when selecting the car, also a Ford man. The smoothness with which the car performs is impressive to me.  Firm and glides beautifully on the roads.  Like the structure and more important the safety devices attached to the car. "
mercury,montego,2005,Call me Satisfied, 05/06/2005,2005 Montego All Wheel Drive with CVT,4,"This is really a nice car.  Moved from a Linclon LS to this.  The engine is a little underpowered but this is a very comfortable car to ride in and it has tons of room and lots of leg room.  The interior is well appointed.  I already have two door dings which may be caused by the increased height of the vehicle, but overall, it is well designed, very comfortable and attractive.  "
mercury,montego,2005,Don, 05/24/2005,They finally did it!,5,"This car is unbelievable! I'm 36 years old and NEVER in my life would have thought I'd own a Mercury, but this car converted me. I was shopping for an upscale sedan that was good-looking, fun to drive, well-built and could carry people in comfort. I looked at everything from Audi's and BMW's to Toyota's and Honda's, but NONE of them compared to this car. The Montego has European ride and handling with Japanese build quality! Sure its not as exciting on the outside as some of the others, but it is very elegant looking and the interior far surpasses them in style, quality, and comfort. I've driven nothing but imports for 15 years and I have to say, this is the best car I've ever owned."
mercury,montego,2005,j.o., 07/03/2005,Another better idea from Ford L/M,5,"What a fantastic car!!  It is so comfortable and fun to drive.  We had the spoiler, clear bra, window tint, Eclipse navagation system and locking gas cap added aftermarket.  It is very sporty and has all the features that more expensive cars have.  The CVT transmission is very smooth.  We could have bought a more expensive car, but this car has it all for a great price.  It handles very well on corners and excellent braking.  We were going to get a Lincoln Zephyr in 2006, but the Montego has more room and AWD with almost Lincoln luxury.  Ford kicks GM's butt with this and many other fine cars and trucks. Chrysler 300 is no match for this car either.  Compare any sedan to top notch Montego."
mercury,montego,2005,R. Long, 07/30/2005,Great Car,4,"The ride is very comfortable. My wife and I like the way the adjustable seating works. We both like the looks of the interior and exterior of the car. I like the view one gets while driving. We only have 3000 miles driven, but we are very pleased with the car so far."
mercury,montego,2005,Mike D., 08/10/2005,Ford man all the way.,5,"1st of all, I traded an 04 F150. great truck needed something that didn't drink the gas as fast. I love the car, style, comfort, sound system everything about it. I purchased the all wheel drive Premere edition with that CVT transmition. Took the car on a ride over route 2 in Ma. it handled the mountain rd with no problems.  For those of you who are thinking of buying the Montego or the Ford 500, GO FOR IT.  Mike D."

After 7600 miles of driving I averaged 28.5 mpg HWY and 20.2 mpg city. The inside space and trunk size is best in class, overall quality is excellent,as is the driving and handling performance. For those who complain about engine size and power, I suggest get yourself a sports car and disqualify yourself commenting on an excellent family car,which is very appropriate considering current gas prices !"
mercury,montego,2005,FH, 05/11/2006,FH,5,Handles nice. Roomy interior with very comfortable seating. Very roomy in front & back seat. Large trunk at a nice height for putting in ad removing items. Car seems to have the best features of a car that sits tall like a van.

Driving it is so much fun with excellent vision from the elevated seats, snappy performance and good gas mileage, feeling safe with good brakes and all the safety features Drove it all winter with AWD and regular tires, appreciated the auto climate control (especially since the car warmed up quickly) For a full size sedan, it handles more like a smaller car with a very roomy interior. Hopefully, my family and I will have many years to drive and to ride in it"
mercury,montego,2005,carnut, 07/14/2006,Love this car,5,"Wanted the all wheel drive, but concerned about fuel mileage. This car exceeds all expectations on mileage so far. Car handles great and CVT is terrific. It seems a little slow from dead start, but it gets going pretty quick so I'm not sure what the complaints are about. If you're looking for neck snapping performance, this won't give it to you, but room, comfort, style and economy all together make this a great choice. Looks good in most of the available colors. "
mercury,montego,2005,satisfied customer, 08/16/2006,satisfied owner,5,I continue to be impressed with the car overall.  The fuel mileage has steadly increased from 21.8 during winter driving around town to as high as 24.  Highway mileage is 26 to 31+.  This mileage is accurate as I compute the mileage every fillup.  The awd is fantastic. I drove through snow that was coming over the hood and never lost traction. The low end torque makes it possible to start off without spinning the tires on ice and heavy wet snow.  The defrosting is great even with the heavy snow in very poor visibility.  The stability and control is better than all the 4 wheel drive vehicles I have had in over 50 years of driving.
mercury,montego,2005,Misti Doty, 09/17/2006,Lots of room...,4,This car has loads of room and fits car seats well but the 6 speed automatic doesn't perform as expected.  Also fuel economy is not on par for a 210 hp small V6 that moves the vehicle along brisk enough I guess...
mercury,montego,2005,XXGMSMGXX89, 12/17/2006,Fun to Drive or Fun to Cruise?,4,"I love my Montego CVT AWD.  It handles so great for a car of its size, and has awesome acceleration (obviously, not better than a Maxima or Avalon...).  Last night, I was coming home from a party, and I had some fun on the highway.  Let me just say, the CVT really has a great ratio spread and the engine, despite having only 203 hp, is pretty snappy above...60 mph. (ok, around 75 I floored it, and the tacho went up to 6700 rpm, and I went from 75 to 90 in around 2 seconds!) BTW I wasn't drunk, or anything.  I just was in a great mood, and I wanted to drive fast.  I can only hope the new Montego has more (it will,because of the 3.5 liter engine) driving pleasure"
mercury,montego,2005,Mark Sell, 08/03/2007,Great family-business car,4,"Just bought our silver, 11,000-mile 2005 Montego Premier with full safety package and were delighted with its performance on 2k-mile trip. Power is adequate, if not inspiring, but handling is nimble and sure-footed and it makes a great road cruiser. It is comfortable, pleasant and a pleasure on the road - versatile enough for a family with teens, classy enough for clients. Fuel economy is fair at about 24 mpg. Our Lincoln-Mercury dealership is quite good.  This is Calvinist luxury; it has the amenities of a luxury car, but interior feels more sturdy than buttery. In other words, it works on a dinner date, a client drive or a trip to the vet.   "
mercury,montego,2005,Alyssa Czewski, 08/04/2015,Love my Montego!!,5,"I absolutly love my car! Not only is it comfy but it's roomy too. My boyfriend is 6'1'' and sits comfortably in all the seats. When the car is running you can't even hear the engine (I've tried to start it twice). I bought my car used with a salvaged title since it was totaled once and it still runs great with the original computer and motor still in it. The interior and exterior are durable, I'm accident prone and it stands up against me. The trunk is soo big I never worry about having enough room in it or not. It drives extremly smooth down the road and around curves, it loves the highway and get up to 33mpg, about 21-23 in town. Long car rides are what this is made for, being comfortable in it hour after hour. I love that it tells me when the oil life is low and how many miles I have until E. Plus the self check it does tells you if anything is wrong from fluid levels to the trasmission. This car is PERFECT and I will drive it until it can't drive no more.

mercury,montego,2005,Gene Roza, 05/21/2005,Our First Trip,5,"Our quick trip from central California to eastern Arizona put the Montego on its first real test and it passed with flying colors.  Cruising at 77 mph we were getting 29.8 mpg; the entire trip through deserts, mountains and cities (over 1600 miles) averaged 25.4.  The comfort was more than expected.  We have the AWD which proved great during a snow storm in Pinetop/Lakeside.  We shopped around before making a decision and we believe so far this was the right decision.  Anyone looking for a luxury (?) car without paying into the range of $40-55K should try the Montego.  Try the AWD with the CVT transmission......highly recomended!!!!!"

It had a lot of ""bells and whistles"", like seat warmers, moonroof, leather, beeping back bumper, etc... Unfortunately, the exterior quality and engine quality are out of alignment.  I've had nothing but problems with this vehicle.  Ranging from minor inconveniences such as the trunk latch not working and the brakes needing replaced after 30K miles (covered by manufacturer recall), to major issues like the a/c needing replaced and the transimission failing after only 63K miles.  I would warn anyone looking at this vehicle to not let the outside fool you.  This is a poorly made Ford.  "

Overall, very snazzy car, HID headlights, premium cd, etc. I can't even emphasize enough how roomy this car is inside. Was very happy.  Downside - they used the old Taurus transmissions in a new car! What a scam! Only 200 hp, very low low-end torque. Build quality showed thru at the end of my lease. Rear driver's side door became water-logged from car wash, rear sway bars and bushings are shot. Power steering pump is shot, dealer insists there's nothing wrong, all Ford's make that loud whining sound when turning a corner. And that's why I'm buying a BMW next!"

It is comfortable and a real pleasure to drive, both in town and on long road trips. The fuel economy surprised me, since the Montego is a large car. I routinely get 29-30 MPG on the highway and 26 in town. In all, a fine package and a good value."

I bought mine 3 summers ago  -- now with the warranty set to expire, I wondered: do I keep it or trade it in?  My answer -- keep it, I like it so much. When the Montego crossed my radar, it met or exceeded every criteria -- very roomy interior, good gas mileage (31mpg on a recent hiway trip), trunk that can hold many sets of golf clubs, sun roof, cvt, awd. And the price was very reasonable. I feel a little luxury every time I drive it, and I didn't overpay."
mercury,montego,2005,Jim, 08/05/2008,Great Car,4,"I bought this car after the 2006 models had come out. The car is roomy, comfortable and has all the features I want. The dealer discounted the AWD with the CVT transmission. The transmission is very smooth but I only get 25 MPG on the highway and about 20 in town. My guess is that the MPG would be better without the AWD.  It's a great car and I'd buy another one.  I like the name Montego much better than Sable. I had a 1992 Sable and it fell apart at 50,000 miles."

In limited short trip city driving averge mpg so far about 16.   Acceleration has been more than adequate.    Went from van to Montego and am pleased with the driver's seat height and visibity - much better for me than most sedans (too low).   Front passenger space seems a bit confining.

Power was adequate, but the engine was rough and noisy.  The CVT was weird, but seemed to work OK.  I could get used to it.  The car is nothing special to look at and a bit unrefined.  The price is right, however, and if it had been more comfortable, I might consider it. There are too many other choices out there."
mercury,montego,2005,Tony , 04/13/2005,Want a great car Get A Mercury Montego,4,Smooth ride and very quiet powerful V6 and opional AWD and very nice interior with very comfortable seating and very roomy and it has great crash test ratings 
mercury,montego,2005,Dale K. Anderson, 05/15/2005,Totally Satisfied,5,"I have owned about 20 Lincolns and Mercurys, have been generally satisfied with most, but disliked my 2004 Gr. Marq because the manufacturer cheapened the car by deleting standard equipment.  By chance, a neighbor purchased a new Montego, allowed me to drive it and I decided THEN to buy.  I settled upon the Montego Premier and believe that it is probably one of the best cars I have ever owned.  It is solid,performing, comfortable, fuel- effficient car with safety features beyond any other car that I have owned. "
mercury,montego,2005,Suzanne, 06/12/2005,Enjoy driving the Montego,5,"I just returned from a 500 mile trip to North Carolina, driving my new AWD Merc Montego.  It is a joy to drive on the road and through the mountains.  Very comfortable both in the front and back seat area.  With 4 adults in the car, we felt uncrowded.  The trunk is enormous and held all of our luggage with ease.  All in all, it is a great car for travel."
mercury,montego,2005,WALNUT, 06/30/2005,Walnut Quality,4,"Montego is everthing as advertised; exact mileage, comfort and solid feel. Plus, you feel safe because of all the safety features.  * Only would have like a GPS mapping system navigation on board !"
mercury,montego,2005,LTCnTX, 07/09/2005,Love My Montego,5,I think the 2005 Mercury Montego is the most comfortable car in it's size group I have ridden in.  I drove cross country and remained comfortable the entire time.  I'm very short and love the way the Montego seats sit up higher than in a normal sedan. I also like all of the safey features packed into this car.  I would be happier with a little bit better gas mileage but I will trade that for the comfort.
mercury,montego,2005,William Parris, 07/11/2005,Montego awd 2005 Premier,5,"Inside noise level is very low. The driver seat adjustment has enough travel room to satisfy most any driver. Traction control is great in keeping the car level in any kind of quick turns. This new Transmission does a great job with no feel that the engine, transmission ratio is changing. I think this is the best automobile that Ford has come up with by using some of Volvo proven designs."
mercury,montego,2005,Ted, 08/28/2005,2005 Montego,4,"Car has adequate power.Ride is very comfortable. Gas mileage is very good. Transmission shifts very smoothly. Adjustable pedals are a plus for short drivers. Air bags front,side and side curtain are great safety feature. Large rear view mirrors keep blind spots to a minimum. A fine car around town and on the road.  "
mercury,montego,2005,Montego, 08/29/2005,Satisfied,4,"In past years we have driven Mercury Grand Marque's but more recent we drove a Ford Windstar(2002). It was large and intimidating for the wife so it was traded for the Montego. The Montego has more room than the GM, a little shorter also, and rides great. The gas mileage is ""right on the money"" what the advertised numbers are. The complaint of being ""underpowered"" is overstated. We are not buying this vehicle for the ""drag-strip"" but for  comfortable and fairly economical family sedan which it is. "
mercury,montego,2005,George, 09/11/2005,Best Sedan I've Owned,5,"I knew this was the right car for me as soon as I sat down in the driver's seat.  The comfort of the seat, the position of the wheel and pedals, the layout of the switches on the steering wheel, the large door mirrors, and the view of the road are all so superior to the competition's product.  I've received compliments on the rear seats, too.  Even though I have the driver's seat moved back, adults have plenty of foot room.  The engine has plenty of power for normal city and freeway driving, and the CVT transmission is so smooth!  Handling and braking are exceptional - helped by the large wheels and tires. "
mercury,montego,2005,Mercury lover , 09/24/2005,Bad Replacement for the Sable,5,My 2005 Mercury Montego Premier is great it has great syling and performance and has a HUGE backseat and a HUGE trunk and i love the smooth quiet ride and the beautiful Norsea Blue Paint and those nice 18in rims and i love the HID Headlamps and The Chromed Trimmed LED Tail lamps and the Command seating gives you a much better veiw of the road and so does the HID Headlamps all in all the Montego is a great car but my wife has a 2005 Mercury Sable LS Premium and i like that much better because it has a much more richer and classy interior but i like my Montego just the way it is ...
mercury,montego,2005,Jim Wells, 10/25/2005,Great Value and Comfort,5,"It won't snap your neck from the take- off, but then I don't need to get to 60 MPH in 4.5 seconds...The reviews citing this as a severely underpowered car are way over the top.  It is a well- designed and straight-forward car that evokes the qualities that Ford made famous in the  '30s through the 60s.  Great value for the money and everyone who has seen my merlot Premium is impresssed. I am looking forward to a long road trip. "
mercury,montego,2005,Bob Pollock, 12/13/2005,2005 Mercury,4,No problems to date - wife's car so it is not driven daily.  Have had two (2) 500 mile trips - mileage just now getting up to rated - 28 / 29 mpg highway.  Like the six speed auto - very smooth.  Good looks outside and inside.  Lots of room in back seat and trunk area.  Could use more power but the six speed helps the 3 liter engine perform fairly well.          
mercury,montego,2005,Robert Claus, 12/22/2005,Great Car,4,"The Montego is a great car for the money, it has all the options you want included in the price. The car handles great in town or on the highway. Gas mileage in the twenties . Power seat on passenger side is only two way. No key lock for the trunk. Side veiw mirrors are large, already have broke one. Visibility is great front and rear. "
mercury,montego,2005,The Nest, 01/01/2006,CPA,4,"I am extremely pleased w/ the design of the vehicle, it is comfortable for 4 adults and luggage. Also the gas mileage is very good - power on highway is adequate - traveling 75-80 on interstate. Very roomy interior and trunk is very large. Vehicle handles very well in traffic and responds well. sound system is very good and I am just plain very pleased with the vehicle after 12,000 miles.     "
mercury,montego,2005,txhoser, 01/05/2006,Best in its segment,4,"I like the size at 200"" it fits into the garage much better than my F150.  The ride is smooth but not at Cadilac standards.  The sound system is good but could use a sub-woofer -- and an amp. Watch out of large bumps and dips.  The wheele travel is short and bottoms out quickly.  The seats offer good support but are by no means sport buckets -- more for comfort which they do very well."
mercury,montego,2005,James T., 01/19/2006,2005 Mercury Montego Review,4,"I enjoy my 2005 Montego.  The vehicle is very roomy and storage space is more than adequate.  Gas mileage is good, the ride is firm yet comfortable and responsive, and construction quality is above average.  Two problems encountered to date have been one failure to start immediately which self-corrected and has not been experienced since it occurred and acceleration from a ""dead"" stop is, in my opinion, below average.  Also, the recall concerning the straps holding the gas tank was disturbing but was handled quickly and professionally.  Overall, I rate the vehicle above- average and would consider buying another."
mercury,montego,2005,dicky, 01/23/2006,Dream Car,4,Excellent handling on slick roads. Braking very good. Has plenty of power for passing.  CVT provides smooth acceleration.  Very good view of outside.   
mercury,montego,2005,ellie, 03/10/2006,enjoyable ride,5,"After my children grew up and after driving several vans for 22 years, I finally have a car that I can call my own.  I enjoy the features, the controls on the steering wheel, automatic/dual heating/cooling system, the 6 CD changer, etc.  So far the mileage in town has been 23+, much better than my vans.  The ride and handling is comfortable and smooth.  I especially picked this car because of its volvo design and engineering, especially the safety features and elevated seating.  I just wish it had side curtain/side impact airbags as a standard feature.  I think american automakers are missing the boat, not including these features."
mercury,montego,2005,Fred S., 04/25/2006,A great family car.,4,Replaced a Ford Windstar that was too large for the wife. She loves this vehicle. I now have my truck back. 
mercury,montego,2005,Rico, 06/01/2006,Traded Chrysler 300 for Montego AWD,4,"After 2 winters of Chrysler 300 RWD, I wanted an AWD vehicle. Liked the value of Mercury Montego. Added a spoiler and chrome trim on doors, side molding and trunk to spruce up the looks. I am very pleased overall with the car. Very comfortable."
mercury,montego,2005,robert siuzdak, 06/19/2006,very happy,4,"Very solid, i also have a 04 town car, this has less wind noise. holds the road well,power ok, i would be happy with a few more horses. interior space is great. we wanted cloth seats, they are comfortable, but the leather version seems a bit wider, rear seat belts are hard to insert. headlights very bright, but have a short distance. local gas mileage good, should be better at highway speeds."
mercury,montego,2005,2005 Mercury Montego, 07/24/2006,My Mercury Montego,4,"This car has exceeded my expectations in terms of its performance and comfort.  My 6'4"" son can sit in the back without being cramped which says a great deal about the size of the interior. On the highway, the car holds it own and seems to command respect from other drivers.  Also, it's reassuring to press the accelerator to get an extra surge of power when needed.  On top of everything else, the Mercury Montego is exceptionally beautiful. I am very happy with this car."
mercury,montego,2005,Adolph Lobato, 08/17/2006,retired owner,5,"Auto is smooth riding, no wind noise, i like the cvt transmission you never feel when it shifts, cup holders are to close to each other that could be improved  mileage is good for a car of this size"

$24K; priced about the same as a Sable 
wagon, but much nicer.  Even the 
popular priced model has many luxury 
appointments, a quiet, controlled ride 
and smooth transmission.  I'm 6'4"" tall

This car has it in abundance, plus a 
huge trunk.  It won't seat six 
passengers like the Grand Marquis, but 
its design, styling, interior 
appointments and ride are much more up-
to-date.  If this new model proves to 
be reliable, then Mercury has a real 
winner."
mercury,montego,2005,pod, 12/31/2004,new montego v. old sable,4,"Visually a successful modernization of 
the Sable.  Solid feeling chassis. 
Larger wheels. Excellent, though 
conservative, body lines and exterior 
materials.  The interior is improved 
over the Sable giving a superb seating 
position.  The few new electronic 
readouts are helpful. The seats are 
disappointing in that there is 
inadequate lateral bolstering, 
although this car isn't going to 
generate much g-force on turns so it 
may be academic.  I wanted to remain 
loyal to mercury's value oriented 
products but the engine/transmission 
combination and the added weight make 
this a sluggish, underpowered car.  I 
prefer my Sable in that regard. 
Overall an impressive redo but fatally 
underpowered."

mercury,montego,2005,Leo Grachow, 01/17/2005,"It's too soon to tell, but so far ....",4,"I have been driving the Montego for almost 4 weeks, and it has yet to disappoint.  Although most automotive rags dissed the engine as too small (should be an ""8"") I have found that with the CVT (transmission), the car flows nicely in highway traffic, and couldn't be smoother in the city.  No problems there!  The only problem I have encountered to date is the ""rain spotting"";  for some reason, the windows do not release water droplets well, and it is necessary to squeegee them after a rainfall, especially the rear window (which could probably use a wiper).  Overall safety impression is positive due to volvo platform and higher stance (to counter SUVs, etc.). I give an A+ overall."

One is in the typical place and the other one is somewhat hidden in the front center console, apparently for charging a cell phone. This is my first Mercury and I couldn't be happier.   "

mercury,montego,2005,JerryL, 03/12/2005,From Town Car to Montego,4,"On 1-17-05 traded a '03 TC for a new Montego.  On 1-18 left on a 3 wk. roundabout trip to AZ.  Returned with 6,500 miles on the clock.  Cold, hot, desert, mountains, snow,and ice.  Driving was a pleasure, AWD was great.  My wife is 5' tall and she could see fine.  Had no problems whatever with the vehicle.  Ford has finally got it about right.  The engine is strong but it does work getting up to speed. but with the CVT it is an adequate performer.  Averaged 26.2 MPG on a new vehicle and we both have heavy feet.  CVT is same unit as Audi uses, AWD is Volvo.  More comfortable and enjoyable to drive than the TC.  Handling is more positive and it dosent have the TC seat from hell."
mercury,montego,2005,Montgomery, 04/05/2005,Audi-esque,4,"I have owned many cars and SUV's.  I wanted an all wheel drive sedan. The Mercury Montego reminds me very much of my 2001 Audi A6.  The design is clean, not garrish like the Chrysler 300.  The CVT is extrememly smooth.  The car handles well and is HUGE inside.  The gas mileage is better than any other full size sedan or SUV I have driven recently, and it performs on regular gas, not premium.  The engine is a little coarse, but has adequate power."

My experience with my Montego FWD Premier has changed all of that. This is a very nice car!!!  The exterior appearance speaks for itself; it exudes class. The interior is very elegant as well; I particularly like the two-tone leather and audiophile radio.  The safety features (I have the safety package option)are world class.  I traded in a Pontiac GTO (built by Holden in Australia) on this car. Coming off a 350 HP car and reading the stinging criticism of this car being underpowered, I haven't found anything to be concerned about!  It's a non-issue"

If you are looking for a CAR that is actually comfortable for 5 people who might have luggage, this might just be THE BEST car on the market --> especially when price is a consideration.  Backseat head and legroom is excellent in all three seat positions.  The six- speed automatic transmission takes some getting use to, but gets the job done.  I preferred this to the Ford 500 for the two-tone leather interior, HID headlamps and LED taillights.  Gas mileage has been decent so far averaging about 26 mpg in mixed city/hwy driving. "

I am a senior lady and was on my own as far as finding a car and doing my own research.
I used this website often.
I drove 8 cars.
The Mercury was the first car I drove and after considering all the others, it is the car I bought.
I am no expert, but I do know quality and recognize performance in cars.
This car is a lovely car.
Good looking, big comfy interior, a heavy weight which drives and feels good.
Corners great.
You could live in the trunk.
On the downside, undersized engine and some peculiar gadget arrangements inside.
But overall, a wonderful buy.
If you find one with low miles, buy it.

I see over 17 mpg in town driving and 28 and change on the road with three and a half folks inside and stuff in the trunk.  I never have to ask; Hey you got enough room back there?, there's plenty, even the Shack might not complain.  If you like more power it's coming soon in '08 from what I read. I drove out through the mountains of CO. and did it without strain. Try one. Ok I do work there:) "
mercury,montego,2006,not impressed, 03/06/2007,not weather proof,2,"My problem has to do with the rain, water and leafs, pine needles, sand, anything that touches the windows goes into the door. The seal that is normally against the window in most cars, making it waterproof is not present on the Montego, in fact in discussing this with the few people that I was allowed to talk to at Mercury it was noticed that all of their cars except one, is now built this way. The seal that does touch the window is too far down, what doesn't go into the door with normal wind or vibration of the car goes into the door when the window is lowered. My car is not garage kept, I have mulch that is falling out of the bottom of the door, until it plugs up. Then what ice, rust...."
mercury,montego,2006,Merc Fan, 11/05/2008,69000 Miles of Joy,4,"I was looking for a replacement for my reliable 2000 Mercury Sable LS with 225,000 and saw this car on the the net. The car had 6000 miles on it and was like new,from a Lincoln Mercury dealer, in Mertlot with a tan interior. The car other than the rear brakes replaced under the TSB there have no service other than maintenance. This car has been a joy to own and on long drives. This car is the best secret in the auto business with great features, great gas mileage 32-38 mpg expressway and 22-25 city drivung with an average of 27 mpg overall and great comfort. The car is in made in Chicago with great fit and finish. "
mercury,montego,2006,KNOFAC, 07/08/2010,Underrated,5,"Just got this recently and I love it. I've always liked large ""dad cars,"" and this car is a monster!  Its design is subtle, and probably bland to most, but I love how elegant it looks.  It's a deceptively powerful car that accelerates and handles like a dream. Could use a little more power, though. It's roomy, which is great for my lankier build.  Tons of trunk/passenger space.  It's mechanically sound and has a great factory sound system.  The fuel economy is right around 20/28 for me, which is very good for a huge V6 vehicle.  Overall, this car is a sleeper hit.  It's comfortable and efficient, but won't appeal to fans of smaller vehicles that preach about fuel economy."
mercury,montego,2006,richman6, 01/09/2014,Missed opportunity,3,"When I first purchased this car I was initially impressed.
It was very comfortable to drive with the seating and easy to get in and out of the car with lots of trunk space.
Unfortunately, then the problems started to surface.
The paint began to peel off the leading edge of my aluminum hood, the drivers side window goes down when you press the up button, the rear drums are rusting prematurely, and the module that controls my AWD shorted out my control panel!
The dealer quoted me $1900 to replace the module and keep my AWD!  My first and probably last experience with the Ford brand.
BTW, my car has not even reached 100,000 miles.
Update7-9-16:  On top of losing a couple of the cars best features, this winter my heated seats stopped working and now my a/c needs repair.  I also have a groaning noise in the front end that I have not even begun to investigate.  To sum up this experience, If you are going to buy a new Ford to drive for a few years, it's probably a good option, if you are looking for a long term commitment, look elsewhere.

mercury,montego,2006,wizard7, 01/10/2007,Fantastic !!,4,"This is our stealth car.  You really hardly notice it, not a flashy spot on it (except the headlights).  But if you want Comfort, driving Ease, Plenty of Room, and a Quiet Ride, the Mercury Montego is Fantastic!  Unbeatable!  Quieter than our friend's Jaguar - by far.   And amazingly easy to park, although it is not necessarily a Long car, just Big.  We added the heated seats and we love them.  Standard sound system is OK, but most people will probably want the upgrade.  Drive one.  Check out the view.  Ours is Satellite Silver, very nice."

mercury,montego,2006,Dan, 01/08/2009,Favorite car I've owned,5,"I switched from GM products to Ford products way back in the 80's when I had to work on different cars. I had a 2001 Sable and wanted a car with warranty for my wife. This car blows me away. The AC controls that allow balance side to side or front to rear, the auto seat setting that sets per which remote control is used, the backup sensors, the big mirrors make backing up a pleasure, the radio that adjust sound level to speed, the fold down back and front passenger seat that allows long packages, the message center that tells all about the car, the steering wheel controls for cruise and radio, plus the 5 star safety rating...plus buying it used, what a deal and I got 100K of warranty!"
mercury,montego,2006,Denali89107, 08/29/2010,I want another one,5,"Despite the fact that the original dealer went belly-up last year, we still love our Montego. It's by far the most comfortable vehicle we've ever had - or will have.  It has been totally problem free except for a recall to replace the rear disk brakes at no cost to us. We're really saddened to see the Mercury brand go away and would love to find another vehicle that has the tremendously comfortable seating of the Montego."
mercury,montego,2006,Carol York, 08/04/2006,Carol's critique,4,Mileage not as good as expected Like the large windshield Would like to have a digital dash (totally) Seatbelt placement is good Very quiet ride
mercury,montego,2006,ACE , 03/19/2006,So Much car for such a small price,4,"About 2 weeks ago i bought a Mercury Montego Luxury AWD i am very happy with my car it has many features that a Lexus ES 330 didn't even have and at about $7,000 dollars cheaper i like the way the car handles and rides its very smooth and quiet and acceleration is good but should be a little bit more powerful due to the cars size i am also glad the Montego has command seating which gives you a much better view of the road and the big side mirrors make it easy for getting in and out of tights spaces and so does the Parking Asst. and i like the black leather interior and the nice Silver Birch Paint Color and in my opinion this car should put Mercury back on track because it ia a wonderful car."
mercury,montego,2006,Marc, 01/17/2007,Can't beat it.,4,"Can't beat the Mercury Montego.  AWD, spacious interior, comfortable, all the bells and whistles, loaded ""to the gills"" for around $30K.  It's the poor man's Audi A8 but Audi doesn't offer 6 years with zero interest loans."
mercury,montego,2006,Roy, 12/27/2005,Mercury Montego,2,"The Montego is a decent car with a few exceptions. My main complaint is the area where you would rest your left foot is awkward as the wheel well comes in at that area and makes long drives very uncomfortable due to the restricted area for your left foot. My second complaint is the seats should be wider & the console narrower. The width of the seats is very restrictive. The seats could be padded a bit better as well. The CVT transmission is great & smooth, the engine lacks acceleration but is ok under normal driving. My Montego averages about 20-21 MPG which is lower than the specs state but still good. I'm not sure of the aluminum block for long life.Radio is real cheep sounding. "
mercury,montego,2006,Ed C, 07/22/2019,I still love this car,5,"I purchased this car in 2014 with only 25,000 on it. I have loved this car from the day I got it. The 6 cyl, while not screamingly fast, has good acceleration. Much of this car was designed by Volvo. The handling is phenomenal for a car of his size considering that it isn't a BMW. IT doesn't feel like an old person's car when I'm driving it. It is important to use cruise control on the hi way or you will be doing 85 without knowing it. The seats are very comfortable and when someone gets in the back, they appreciate the great leg room. A small family could live in the trunk. I get 19 mpg city and 28 hiway if I keep it to 70 mph. I have owned it for 5 years. It has had little in the way of repairs. Engine, transmission, steering, suspension, and breaks are all good. It is good to have a car this size when needed. My wife has a Civic (wonderful car) but even with the lesser gas milage, she now wants us to take mine on long trips.

mercury,montego,2006,jordan, 03/31/2006,Great American Car,5,"An exceptional vehicle. Ride, handling, interior room, CVT + AWD, fuel economy, build fit and finish have all exceeded my expectations. Wrap it up in a car that has the best safety rating of any American car, and you quickly understand that this is a wonderful vehicle that represents the best possible car/suv combo out there today, all for much less than my 06 RX330. It feels good to be able to buy American again.  Bravo Mercury for a job well done!!!!  "
mercury,montego,2006,Kay Roberts, 09/05/2006,Best car for the price,5,"This is by the nicest car for the price, and I am including small BMW.  It is very solid and rides like a car double the price."
mercury,montego,2006,vinnie, 05/13/2007,Still too soon to know for sure,4,"I changed the tires immediately, they were a bad ride.  The motor is a bit loud in 1st first gear. I said the car hesitates when going into 2nd gear, but the dealer shot me down. The rear brakes drag when left overnight, there is a TSB so the dealer put new rear brakes and turned the rear rotors. The car is good on longer trips.The exterior mirrors are good in day driving, but I seem to have my vision on the left blocked and a glare. My wife likes the high drive visibility. Needs some more power when leaving from a light. I had a Mercury before this one and it lasted me 18 years, why fool with success. "
mercury,montego,2006,Stephanie, 01/16/2009,Wonderful,5,"I was looking for a bigger car, really an SUV, but when I started looking I realized I couldn't afford it. So I saw the Montego and at first I was unsure but after I drove it and tested it to the max it's wonderful, great on gas, roomy, and of course with the leather it's perfect. It rides smooth and quite comfortable I must say.  So if you are looking for a car the Montego is a great way to go."

mercury,montego,2006,BSM, 06/19/2018,I love this car!,5,"In Dec. '16 I drove over 2 hrs. to dealer in Teterboro, NJ w/a retired Ford/Mercury mechanic who did inspection of my SUV Sedan inside, out & under. It had just over 72,000 miles on it. Dealer ended up selling to me for $5,500 because the driver's seat heater did not function. I really can live w/o a heated seat.  I really liked the looks of this black beauty, but what really sold me was it's SUV sitting height, storage sf and above all--ADJUSTABLE PEDALS!  My height is just under 5'.  I have been driving 58 years w/no accidents & no tickets so I know a thing or two about driving and cars! WHY DON'T ALL VEHICLE MAKES COME WITH ADJUSTABLE PEDALS especially with so many of our more recent immigrants also being vertically challenged? My next car WILL have those pedals! Only problem I have had is that last Nov. it turned over nicely but would not start. Had it towed to local Ford Dealer. Turned out it was not the fuel pump but the Power Control Module which it turned out was still covered on this beauty! If Ford brings back this car or makes any with a reasonable size such as the doomed Fusion, when I need another vehicle, I would buy it for  the Adjustable pedals. I suppose most car makers' engineers are closer to 6' or they would get on it. WAKE UP CAR DESIGNERS!!!!!!

mercury,montego,2006,don, 08/30/2006,A Little Disappointed,3,"Since all of the test drives were done in the daytime, we didn't realize that there were no daytime driving lights until after the final deal. I like DTDLs especially for overcast and rainy days. I like to be seen. The interior is great except that there is no automatic unlock feature when you put the car in park. I did notice this  before but thought it was minor. My mistake, very inconvenient. Did have the emissions light come on during a trip, took it to a Ford garage but they couldn't look at it for about 4 days. Couldn't even tell me if it was OK to drive. Very poor customer service IMO. As it turned out the gasket on the gas cap was bad. Don't like the gas cap design. Hard to use."

mercury,montego,2006,deacon, 12/11/2005,I have enough power,5,"the montego has enough power for me. a bigger engine would be good for power buffs, but this vehicle will get up and scat pretty darn good.  the only thing i wish it would have would be the power seat on the passenger side to adjust up and down. otherwise the seats are good. i love the height of the seats in the car, great visabilty.  the car handles very ggod on wet pavement . on dry it has a tendency for a little understeer.  my friend has the cvt with awd and it is fantastic. the volvo haldex system is probably the best on the market today and am glad that ford is using it on the 500 and the montego.  to sum this up, a great car for the ride and price, roomy nad comfortable."
mercury,montego,2006,Keigh Howland, 12/15/2005,Continental Replacement,4,A layperson's assessment of the 2006 Mercury Montego Premier AWD. I was looking for a replacement for a 1999 Continental; felt the Montego came the closest and I'm not disappointed. CVT transmission very smooth and satisfactory for passing. General driving --26.9 MPG after 2011 miles.
mercury,montego,2006,JP, 02/07/2006,Good Family Car,4,"Just got my Montego a month ago.  Nice family car, lots of room for the kids.  While people have complained about the acceleration I think it is adequate however the CVT gives you the impression the car is not accelerating.  Interior is very comfortable for a 6' driver.  The perforated leather is a little cheesy.  Drives and handles nicely and the Merlot color turns heads, nobody even knows what kind of car it is."
mercury,montego,2006,DavidB, 03/26/2006,Worth Consideration,4,"If you're not hung up on luxury car brand names then the Montego is a great alternative care choice.  Roomy, solid feeling ride, good looking (although not in the class of some of the luxury brands), great cabin layout, pretty good stereo system, acceptable accelaration.  Lots of bang for the buck!  I get a lot of looks when I'm driving this car.  I got it in the Merlot color.  I switched from a 2003 Acura TL to the Montego.  I considered the Avalon, the Azera, the ES330 and the TL, but decided to instead pocket the extra $3,000 to $6,000 those cars would have cost.  I just rolled past 1,000 miles and I haven't regretted my choice."

This is the first American car for us in many years - we expect better than average in every aspect. The comfort and versatility of this car are tough to match anywhere near the <$22k that we paid.

The instrument panel is attractive and functional, and the leather seats have a nice look to them.      

After the first 13000 miles, we have yet to experience our first problem of any kind.      The ride is very comfortable and the handling is very controlled.    Mileage seems to be about what they claim for the car which is 21/29mpg.      Performance is sufficient for a car this size unless you really need to be the first away from every light.

I have been pleased with the fuel economy for such a large car.  I think that Mercury has a real winner with this one.
mercury,montego,2007,Patrick Miller, 12/29/2015,"Even used with a lot of miles, this is a great car",5,"I bought a used 2007 Mercury Montego with about 112,000 miles on it. As much as the previous owner babied the car, I was surprised that he had never serviced the CV transmission. After several months and a few thousand miles, I became concerned when the check engine light started coming on during long trips. I took the car to a Ford dealer and got the transmission serviced. They assured me there was no problem with the transmission. My mechanic replaced the oxygen sensor which made no difference. A second trip to another Ford dealer revealed no CVT problems, but a fuel pump that needed replacing. Ever since getting that problem fixed, the car has run like a dream. 

I've had many people ride with me and comment on what a nice car I have. They can't believe it's eight years old with more than 120,000 miles on it. Living in northeastern North Dakota, I really appreciate the AWD performance on snow and ice. The big, wide Michellen tires are great. The heated leather seats, excellent heating and cooling system, great all-round visibility, huge side mirrors, confident steering, ride stability, fog lights, and air bags all around give me confidence on the road during adverse driving conditions. The car provides a great, comfortable driving experience. The interior is very roomy and the trunk is huge. 

The interior and exterior are by no means flashy, but far from homely. The car could use a bit more horsepower, but the lack of power hasn't been a problem in the flatland where I normally drive. The audiophile sound system isn't as good as the one in my Fusion. I do wish they'd included an MP3 port on the dash. The car can become a bit of a gas hog driving into a stiff headwind. Otherwise, it's close to the mileage on the sticker.

mercury,montego,2007,BobRobert, 08/22/2009,Great Car,5,"I had back trouble and was looking for a good mileage car that I could get into. I'm6,1 and 260 lbs so I needed a lot of room. At first I didn't like it as I thought I was leg cramped! I then realized I could move my brake anf gas pedal up and down. That took care of my leg problem. I average between 23-25 miles in the city and about 27-29.6 on the highway! "
mercury,montego,2007,Tim Lange, 08/02/2009,2007 Mercury Montego Premier,4,"Bought it with 14,000 already on the car. Chose it over Buick Le Sabre/Lucerne and similar Oldsmobile.  It has higher seats was easier to get in and out of.  Gas mileage seems poor, I never push it hard and never exceed speed limits, but on a trip of 60mph all day I get at best 24mpg. Most driving is in town, so mileage is usually 19mpg.  Ride is excellent, visibility is good, I'm very happy I bought it."
mercury,montego,2007,Matthew , 01/12/2007,Mercurys PREMIER Ride,4,Mercury Montego is a awesome sedan it has plenty of front and rear leg room for anyone plenty of headroom as well the vehicle hugs the road extremely well the ride and braking are fantastic as well as the trunk space and the engine runs quiet and preforms well for vehicles size but needs more punch. I love Mercury's traditional Satin Waterfall Grille looks great and Montego has plenty of great features for you to like Dual Climate Control Heated/Cooled Seats HID Headlights and LED Taillights make for being seen better and the exterior and interiors fit and finish is great all sealed tight no gaps which makes the ride really quiet I think Mercury's got them a Luxury Sedan thats priced just right
mercury,montego,2007,Cheri0, 08/02/2008,Expressway riding? try this!,5,"Bought car gently used, was like new. No surprise the 6 cyl. isn't great around town, but not real bad. The great surprise is I have gotten up to almost 33 mpg on expressway trips, and believe avg might be better with longer trips! So give it a try! See if the gas needle stays put, on a fast half hour ride!"
mercury,montego,2007,Pat, 10/17/2008,2007 Montego,4,"I just recently bought a slightly used 2007 Montego with 17K miles. It was a returned lease back that was in near perfect condition. I wanted a good quality larger American car that got good gas mileage. I'm not your average Mercury buyer as I'm 30 years old. So far I am really happy with the purchase. This car got such negative press since it first launched and I can't understand why? The engine is plenty adequate for every day driving. At 80mph I'm only hitting 2,100 RPM's. This engine is really reliable as I had it in my Taurus and put 155,000+ miles on it with no major engine problems. Averaging 26MPG overall and usually 29MPG highway."
mercury,montego,2007,max, 05/26/2009,Comfort without much power....,4,Just Bought used with 30k on it.  Love the leather and look.  However the engine is bit gutless...I am going to add KN filter to see if that helps.  Otherwise can was a steal and look and drive great.
mercury,montego,2007,Slepage, 12/17/2018,Excellent vehicle,5,"Owned for 11 yrs... i’ve only had to replace brakes thus far!!  Only thing I miss is the heat seat on the drivers side has stopped working and I understand that’s common with ford/ mercury

mercury,montego,2007,Big daddy, 08/08/2008,So many problems,4,"I love the car. Bought it as a family car. The warranty expired, the car began having electrical problems with its climate controls and the heating seat. Heating seat will no longer work. Climate control will keep switching from leg, to window, to etc, all by itself. I still love the car. Driving stability on the road is awesome, the car corners very well without wobbling like others. It's also very quiet on the road. I can fit the stroller and groceries into the trunk with more than enough space left over.  "
mercury,montego,2007,Ndtish, 10/12/2008,Love My Montego,4,"Bought this car with only 18,000 miles! I just love having factory warranty. I get 29 city and 33 highway, and on one trip that was 4 hours, I got 36 MPG. I even checked it at the pump against what the computer said, and they were both dead on!  I live in the great white north, so on the cold mornings, the heated seats are a plus, and I have lots of heat. My last vehicle was a 99 Taurus, and I had to get the heater core flushed every year in  order to have heat. My daughter has the same problem with her Taurus of the same year. The moonroof is awsome. I use the vent feature the most and it is open even on the cold mornings on my drive to work. This is an amazing car!"
mercury,montego,2007,Elizabeth Clark, 01/28/2008,"A ""Can-do"" car",4,"The base price is good, but you have too many extras which need to be include in the base price. Responsiveness of the steering is outstanding,which may cause the wider turning circle.  The vehicle needs more power--a V8 or a direct fuel injection system. I like the improved responsiveness.      "
mercury,montego,2007,Joe , 07/18/2007,Best car so far,4,"My last 3 cars were made by Toyota and all have been very reliable. Now as we are getting older, I wanted my creature comforts and better, fuller seats. Can't say enough about the car because it is awesome. Even better than an older Caddy that we once owned. On our first trip, I tried to keep the RPM just under 2000, speed 65MPH which achieved 29.6 mpg.."
mercury,montego,2007,LaurelD, 07/25/2007,Just purchased,4,"Just purchased a 2007 sedan and drove on a trip for 5,000 miles.  Impressed with the interior comfort and ability to adjust the pedals as both my husband and I are rather tall.  City driving is fine but accelerating uphill or to pass another car takes planning with the engine size.  Back seat is very roomy but I wish they would have made the front seat go back farther for taller drivers and have the ability to adjust the steering wheel higher up to accommodate knees and high heels when entering the car.  The rear auto-adjust mirror feature at night is great with the bright lights of vehicles coming up behind you.  Overall good value with the quality and end of year price for us! "
mercury,montego,2007,Cindy, 08/11/2009,Transmission out in just 2 years!,4,The transmission went out on my 2007 Montego!  The car is serviced every 3000 miles and babied!  I was totally shocked by this unexpected issue!

mercury,montego,2007,toobad1, 09/03/2011,Car did not meet hype!!!,2,"I bought this car used with 26k miles on it at a Lincoln/Mercury dealer, I purchased the extended warranty which covered the car bumper to bumper for an additional 75k miles and 5 yrs.
Thank God for the warranty because the trans had to be replaced at 46k the master cylinder at 28k the radio at 30k the exhaust hanger at 34k and the paint on the car was bubbling up in about 3 different areas!!!
The CVT trans is crap do not purchase any Ford product with a CVT tranmission!!!
Terrible mpg as well!!!!"
mercury,montego,2007,Satisfied, 06/10/2009,Happy,4,"This car was my first choice in 2005, and when I was finally was able to upgrade in 2006, I choose the Montego. Although I am leasing this one, I am not sure if I would purchase the ""Sable"". I don't care for the renaming of the car. Don't know why it had to be changed. ""Montego"" has a swinging sound and sounds classy and elegant. I find that the features that came standard are great. The price was also great at under 30,000."
mercury,montego,2007,Garibaldi, 07/18/2007,More than you expect,4,"I picked the Montego after exhaustive research and trying a number of different new vehicles. We needed a second car after buying the 2007 Acura TL. The Montego, a fully equipped AWD/CVT model with all the bells and whistles, has been superb, and from the standpoint of inital quality upon ownership, completely trouble free, more trouble free than the well regarded Acura TL, which was in the shop more than half the time the first 6 weeks to replace the a/c compressor which failed because someone had neglected to install some required seals during its build. The seating position is outstanding, view in every direction excellent, ride sure footed and stable, and fit and finish first rate."
mercury,montego,2007,Robert, 04/08/2008,Comfortable Car,4,"No regrets purchasing this vehicle after 3 months of ownership. Handles very well and has a solid, safe feel to it. Not too impressed with the ""audiophile"" system - seems to lack midrange.  Would prefer a 12V outlet in the backseat instead of inside console.  Overall a great value for a better than average vehicle."
mercury,montego,2007,Merc Owner 2007, 07/26/2019,Montego Premier FWD,5,"I bought this as a work car with 170,000 miles on it... dealer certified! (yes even with that many miles they couldn't find anything wrong with it). I have no issues so far, have put on about 5000 more miles. Radio is not great even on the Premier edition, Im sure in 2007 it was fine but we are use to much deeper sounds and bass now a days. Everything works great other than the locks seem to only work with the clicker when I am very close to the car. I think the FWD version with the standard (non-CVT) transmission is the way to go. Seems like they have less issues than the AWD version with the CVT. I get great gas mileage for this large of a car. At 75 mph I get 30.5-33 mpg, at 80 I get right around 29 mpg. This is a large comfy highway cruiser, no sports car I may add.... but not intended to be. Its a big comfy boat made for the road, and I love it! Seats sit up high like a mini-van height, back seat can accommodate 6+ footers easy. Super safe, shares chassis with the Volvo xc90/s80 and is 5 star crash test rated which is a plus in looking for an older used car
"
mercury,montego,2007,Scott, 07/18/2008,Outstanding and Underrated,4,"A good-looking, enjoyable car to drive. Receives many compliments from passengers. Handles very well. All the right gadgets. Plenty of back seat room for tall adults. Very roomy trunk. Great all-around visibility for driver. Avg fuel: 20/28 Highway. Excellent sound system and dash controls. Engine very adequate for all but racers. Great Pirelli tires. I would easily buy another of these wonderful cars. Since 2008 re-badged as Sable and even better with larger engine."
mercury,montego,2007,Paulie, 07/29/2008,Love my Montego,4,"Have had my Montego for almost 7 months & bought as certified pre-owned from dealer. This is a terrific car. I have AWD & am getting an avg of 22 MPG 60/40 highway & city. The CVT transmission and engine combination make for a good value with respect to gas consumption. The V-6 is a bit underpowered however. If it were 250-260 horses vs the 205 with the CVT tranny it would be perfect. (Nissan did this with the Murano- why can't you Ford?) It's adequate but you don't get the ""jolt"" when punching the gas. "
mercury,montego,2007,Ron, 06/27/2007,Expectations exceeded,4,Purchased the car mainly for the Mrs. where safety and comfort were a top priority. It has more than exceeded my expectations. I had a Milan as a loner car for about a week and when I picked up the Montego and drove it home the difference noted in just about every aspect of driving was amazingly better. A day/night difference and an eye opener to the quality built into the Montego. Took the Mrs. about a week to get used the CVT which she now raves about.
mercury,montego,2007,montego, 08/05/2007,Mercury Montego,4,The first thing I noticed was the power.Getting on the freeway It is slow.Also the audio system sounds a little cheap.Be fore this car I drove a 04 Sable that was much quicker and the audio system was better. Other than that it is a nice car and my friends think it is too.So far I have had two small problems with the car. During a trip of 200 miles I was getting 28+ MPG.At 70 MPH
mercury,montego,2007,MANNY B, 09/19/2007,Mercury has another winner,4,"Our new Montego, like the previous 6 Mercs we have owned does not disappoint. The car is comfortable, good looking and comes with all the bells and whistles. The AWD feature is very welcome in a family sedan. The ride is soft, but that is precisely what makes it so smooth and comfortable. Acceleration is adequate, although far from being a speed demon.  "
mercury,montego,2007,T. Pacoe, 09/21/2007,Love It,4,"I love my new car.  It drives wonderfully.  Nice and roomy inside, but doesn't appear too big from the outside."
mercury,montego,2007,Peter , 12/05/2007,Great All Around Car,4,"I have been driving my Montego about six months ago and continue to enjoy it every time I drive it. The CVT transmission took about a week to get used to and now when I drive my wife's 5 speed automatic Honda I find my self missing the CVT.  I have been getting between 23-27 mpg depending on the amount of highway/city driving that I am doing.  Seats are very comfortable and the cabin is very quiet again better than my wife's Honda.  It is a little slow off the start and could use more power but that is the only real complaint.  Handles well, love the HID headlights, plenty of room in cabin and in the trunk (can fit my skis in with out folding down the seat).  Great performer for the money."
mercury,monterey,2004,Flminivan mom, 09/11/2006,Cheap Van,2,"We purchased our van new (17 miles) in 4/2005 because of the huge discounts offered thinking it was a great deal.  This van has had to have rotors turned 3 times, rotors replaced 2 times, has been in for a leak under the rear seat 4 times (w/mildew), has been in 2 times for interior problems (dash) and had had the front tires replaced 2 times and other misc. problems.  It now has 21,000 miles and is going back again for brake issues - vibration when braking. Don't waste your money on this unless you don't mind running it back for repairs every few weeks.  Ford needs to acknowledge the major safety issue with the rotors.  Too many others have had same problem for ours to just be a lemon."
mercury,monterey,2004,Gweller, 10/23/2006,twice the stuff for 1/2 the price,3,"Had this van for 1 year. Bought used w 12k on it. Really shopped around. The good news is they depreciate from new like lead. 35k new paid around 17k So they're a bargain used. I've had one repair, heated seat stopped working. Wouldn't have had this problem w others models because at this price they wouldn't have had the option on them. Great bang ( leather, power sliding doors, dvd, front/rear parking sensors, stability control) for the same buck that will get you a base used Toyota or Honda.   "

A door lock and an AC compressor last year. Total for both $900.00.  This van is solid on the road and comfortable for my 6'2"" 250 pound frame. Interior is very flexible. Pick up and passing performance seems to have improved over the years. I average 16 mpg city and 23mpg highway."
mercury,monterey,2004,Almon, 04/01/2007,Still doing great!,4,"My van now has 52,000 and the only problem was to replace a lock on a sliding door. Just replaced brakes and tires this month. Getting 21 mpg over all. About half of my driving is highway miles. My wife and I still love the looks and the comfort on roadtrips. The engine has a lot of torque and is fast off the line and good at passing in the 45-60 mph range. The advance trac feature really keeps it solid on the road."

mercury,monterey,2004,Heather, 09/02/2006,Finally replaced my villager and WOW,4,"The AC recently went out on my '93 Villager (I cried) and we made the desicion to start looking for a replacement.  We looked at the Ford version of this, but were blown away by all of the extra's that Mercury added.  We got the Premire and it has everything.  We took it to San Diego for a week from Utah and were surpised at how much more room it has than our Villager.  Luggage for a family of Six with room to spare! The older kids love the captains chairs and travel through 105+ temps was a breeze! My in laws took theirs through the Mojave the week temps were 120+ and had no problems.  If it is anything like our Villager it will be with us for a long time."

Looks like egr valve. Cost about $350. Love the car, but the excessive repairs are bleeding me dry! With the transmission complaints abundant, why won't Ford do anything? From a large  family of Ford owners, I may not purchase another due to lack of support of their owners and their own lack of accountability. How sad."
mercury,monterey,2004,bsmith82, 12/06/2008,Great van- great price- love it,4,"Vehicle bought new- no warranty issues - runs very strong. everything still works as new some 4 + years later. Other vans were way too much money and this was a great value for sure. 3 kids, 14/12/9 and we have it loaded and can get 22 mpg at 65-70 mph all day long. City mpg is at best 18- but we have friends with an Odyssey who do no better and freinds with a Sienna who have had engine sludge problems and a door fell off of theirs. Oh yeah- affter 60K miles, we had to do rear brakes. Not bad in my book ! Overall I give this Merc a B+ / A-.  "
mercury,monterey,2004,aml5501, 08/06/2009,I want another one,4,"This was my first minivan and it will be my last. I love this minivan. Everything about it. It is luxury from top to bottom. I just wish it got better gas mileage. I haven't seen another out on the road, which I think is sad because I love it and I think everyone should have one. My kids love the automatic doors the most. I love dropping them off at school and just pushing a button to let them out. I just wish they still made them. I too would love a navigation system and a little more under the seat storage but other than that, it is perfect."

I am easy on my cars, service is very important to me. I would not recommend this vehicle to anyone. I am a 20 year Police Officer and really considering selling all of my Ford products because of this vehicle, terribly dissapointed in Ford Lincoln Mercury for allowing this type of vehicle on the road.

mercury,monterey,2004,DadsretiredfromFord, 04/23/2006,More van for less price than others!,3,"First I drove the Nissan,Honda,Toyota,Chrysler, and Mazda minis.  I Bought the Merc because A) My dad worked for Ford, and B) $14000 off sticker price!  The vehicle is very sharp looking, inside and out, and there are tons of features included on the Luxury edition.  For the same price I paid I would have got a base Sienna with none of the leather, heated seats, power doors, 6CD, trip computer, power pedals, memory power everything, etc. The engine is noisy, but once underway it's quiet.  MPG so far is 17/21, not as good as my old Villager. Problems so far: replaced pwr window motor, vibration in 2 tires, alignment off, squeaking brakes.  Overall a good deal considering the low price paid!"
mercury,monterey,2004,Almon, 01/15/2005,Better than expected after 6000 miles,4,"Tested the Honda and Toyota competition.  The Merecury ride, comfort, safety, performance are very competitive. The price is much better with incentives.  I am over six foot and 240 lbs and I am very comfortable. Rides great at 80 mph on the interstate. Gettting 18 mpg in town and 24+ highway. Terrific interior and dash design. No defects or problrms at the 5000 mile service. Very satisfied with dealer service so far. So many features and good quality for the price. Rear seat flips and folds easily with one hand. I recommend this vehicle"

mercury,monterey,2004,rrherman, 01/27/2006,Great Mini-Van for All Your Family Needs,5,An all around great buy when considering all incentives and price paid for it.  Great low torque power.  VERY comfortable interior.  In our opinion - the best looking Mini-Van out there.  Fuel mileage is comperable to all other vehicles in this segment - which all could show improvement.  3rd row fold flat seat and tip up 2nd row seats provide plenty of seating and carrying options.  We are very happy with it - 2 years later!!  At 60 mph - we get 24 mpg on the highway.  around town is around an average of 16-18 mpg.  Had a few recalls - but those were fixed right away.  no problems with the vehicle otherwise.  HIGHLY R RECOMMEND BUY*ING IT!!
mercury,monterey,2004,Renee, 03/31/2006,Monterey Experience,3,"Beautifully designed minivan with great standard features.  However with very poor gas mileage, much lower than what the sticker stated.  Brakes also tend to be squeaky after van sits for greater than 6 hours. Driver's seat isn't very comfortable.

We bought this car, a Premium model to schlep the dogs and visitors. It has comfort for 7. We got every option, and then added an after market moonroof and wood trim package. It's now 4 years later. The Bentley sits, and we drive the van. It's comfortable, dependable, and has never had a mechanical issue once. I know if I get into this car I'm going to get to where I'm going. Some of the plastic trim items were cheesy, and they could improve on that, but for the price this is a really nice car, and at 3000 miles a year, we're now retired, this car will be with us forever.

Our best fuel mileage, just over 19 mpg on the interstate with cruise control set @ 70mph. Back to dealer several times. Power sliding doors out of adjustment (way out) took two trips. Arm rest fell of front seat. Rear wipper wiped body not glass. A/C compresser locked up at 10,000 miles, dealer replaced complete A/C system.

It has a clunky transmission, a loud ride, brake problems, auto door closing problems and every other option on this car has a had some sort of problem or another! Even though many of the items were thankfully under warranty, it is a constant hassle having it in the shop and there is always some sort of fee that is charged!"
mercury,monterey,2004,Sara, 11/28/2010,"Loved the Villager, tried the Monterey",4,"We have a 95 Villager with 291K & still love it, even without AC. Bought this Monetery after my husband totaled 2002 Villager & ended up with a scratch.  Love it but many repairs.  Now Drivers heated seat is out, Drivers side heat blows cold, replaced transmission at 135K, replace brakes on regular basis, expensive to replace tires, and windshield wipers work intermittently"

It drives smoothly and is wonderful to take on long trips.  The interior design of the van is what we like the most.  It is easy to move around and the front passengers have lots of room for storage.  We like all of the extra features, there are so many.  We love this van!"

finished perfectly. The ride is 
comfortable, handling is predictible, 
pick-up is better than expected.
Nice overall features- heated seats,

mercury,monterey,2004,Lyndita, 01/20/2004,Moving Up To Mercury,4,"I moved up from a Ford Windstar to the 
new Mercury Monterey and I love the

more than adequate for a fully loaded

our frequent trips to Las Vegas."

and decided it was what we wanted. We
drove it to CO in Nov. and it performed
well. When we ran into snow and ice in 
Leadville, etc, the advance-trac system
kept us from slipping. The gas mileage 
is not great but averages around 20 
miles/gallon. The van weighs 4600 lbs 
and handles very well on curves. It is
very quiet in the cabin and handles bad
road conditions very well. We remain
happy with the van now logging over
7000 miles of enjoyable driving.The
heated seats have been a plus this
winter. It is a little early to rate
the reliability but everything gone
well thus far. "

Van. I have been driving vans for years 
and have had 5 different makes.  This 
one tops them all for comfort ride and 
design.  Gas milage is about 17 in the 
city a little less than the other vans 
but the extras make up for it.  The 
comfort is that of a sedan. I highly 
recomend this van for a family luxury 
van.  We even have had people stop us 
and ask to look at the van.  The style 
is attractive to young and old alike."

not had much experience with it yet. 
But so far we have had a problem with 
tires that bump. Also this van needs 
running boards and a grab handle for 
the driver. We are having to buy 
running boards and thought we could 
equip it with a lift for a scooter but 
having a problem with that also. Have 
to lose 3rd seat if we do.Hopefully the 
dealer can resolve the tire problem and 
we can get a lift that works.  "

discontinued the Villager, and was

Villager, but not quite as good around town."

gets driven hard in city traffic every 
weekday.  We had an 01 Villager leased, 
and I was a little concerned that the 
Villager was no longer available.  It 
had been very good to us.  I was 
looking for a replacement when the 
lease expired, but decided to try a 
Monterey.  I was leery because of the 
reputation of the Windstar.  We now 
have 9,000 miles on the van with no 
defects or repairs required at all.  I 
expected much less than we got, my 
driver just loves it.  It was pricey, 
but certainly is made very well.  It's 
not class leading in my opinion, but 
it's still underrated because of the 
way it performs."

mercury,monterey,2004,Mercury Driver, 10/20/2004,Mercury Montery Mileage,3,"We traded a 2000 Olds Siloutte and are 
somewhat disappointed with the Montery 
in comparison.  The gas mileage on the 
Montery is VERY disappointing. We are 
averaging 14 around town and about 19 
on trips. This van is also much louder 
(engine/road sounds) than was our 
Siloutte.  While the van looks great, 
we are disappointed with mileage and 
interior noise.  I also need to note 
when the rear DVD player screen is in 
use it completely blocks the driver's 
sight view from the rear view mirror.  
This was not the case in our 
Oldsmobile.  Lastly, the auto climate 
control is confusing in setting 
temperatures for driver, passenger and 
rear.  The fan speed cuts back to soon 
leaving the car uncomfortabe"

was out there this van with the rebates 
and year discounts made it a worthwhile 
purchase.  Only problem in the short 
period we have had the van is that the 
freon in the air was low and didn't 
cool correctly.  There wasn't a leak

Every amenity is available except a few 
of the gimmick options that each 
manufacturer exclusively carries. We 
love this vehicle! It is a new 
platform for Ford/Mercury so we had a  
few recalls, which were promptly fixed. 
Really don't know how anyone 
would say Dodge/Chrysler is  better & 
looking at specs on Japanese brands 
size, power, mpg, etc. are all 
w/in same ranges w/only slight 
differences. We highly recommend this

foreign made van and began the long 
shopping process over the fall. I had 
read that Mercury had began selling a 
van again in '04, so I gave it a shot. 
I'm glad I did. If Lincoln made a van 
this would be it, and mine isn't even 
the loaded one (Premier), quiet, great 
ride, good power. It's got everything 
you could ever want in a vehicle. I 
don't mind at all giving up a little 
gas milage for the convience and 
luxury the Monterey provides. I have 
recommended this vehicle to all of my 
family and friends. With the rebates L-
M was offering the price for the 
incredibly equipped Luxury (mid-level) 
was unbelieveable. Looking forward to 
a Holiday roadtrip w/ the family."

We were sold on its design and functions, especially the huge area of cargo space.  we fit in a 88"" couch and moved kids from central Illinois to Wisconsin with easy.  The ride is superior and the features are wonderful.  We are currently downsizing and this vehicle is doing the job again.  Beat any pick up truck, and can be quickly converted into a seven passenger van with little effort  and luxury appearance and feel."
mercury,monterey,2004,LA, 05/28/2007,Excellent Van,4,"I absolutely love everything about this van. We purchased it new and fully loaded. I love the way the third seat folds down for extra space if needed. I love the controls for the audio and cruise on the steering wheel at my fingertips. I love the fold down mirror to be able to see my passengers in the rear seats. It is the best van for the money. I get compliments on its looks all the time. The only problem was the self-sealing tires staying aligned. But, having said that they really do work. I got a nail in my tire on the interstate at 70mph. The tire held up until I got to my destination then went flat. The van did not jerk or anything, messgage center let me know to check the tire"
mercury,monterey,2004,bspagnolo, 03/13/2012,Worst Vehicle I have ever owned,1,"Had a 2000 Windstar that had three transmissions in 36,000 miles. Foiund it had silent recall. Got this with concessions from Ford. Many service issues. Just had the
third row seat restraints break loose from the frame. Whole underside of drivers side is rusted underneath . NTSHA has an investigation on this vehicle for safety issues regarding seat mounts breaking free because of rust. I have a 12x12 hole in a wheel well and Ford won't do anything. Only 67,000 miles, Wife drives it. Garage kept. This is the second vehicle ford let us down on. I have owned fords all my life and never again. They don't stand behind what they sell. I suggest everyone with this vehicle check the wheel wells row"
mercury,monterey,2004,SJ Piney, 03/25/2004,Really Like This Mini-Van ... But!,4,"My wife and I really like this 
minivan.  It's very comfortable, well 
appointed and rides very smooth.  We 
like the dash arrangement and the 
analog clock.  We also compared this to 
a loaded Freestar Limited and the 
Monterey is actually about $2000 
cheaper with the same equipment.  Ok 
now for the BUT. For a $34000 vehicle 
the amount of plastic is mind blowing.  
A little leather on the sides of the 
doors would have been a nice touch and 
befitting a Mercury. The other thing is 
the lack of a lockable glove 
compartment.  Even my Jetta has that! 
If you can wait, we recommend getting 
that power tailgate."

pleasure to drive.  I still am learning 
what all the bells and whistles are 
for.  It gives you a smooth ride with a 
lot of pep when you require it.  I love 
it.  The gas mileage could be a little 
better.  Ford needs to work on that 
aspect, but the performance of the 
vehicle is superb.  Very comfortable.  
Another point that would be nice is if 
all the seats folded flat.  The rear 
seat operates quite easily.    "

The second row of captain chairs are also comfortable. The third row isn't as comfortable, but we normally keep it hidden in the floor. The power sliding doors are a real convenience when carrying grandbabies or groceries. Also like the in dash 6 CD changer. Wish it had a GPS navigation system. But that's all I would add. Love to drive it. It is very agile for a minivan and is actually pretty quick off the line. "

MSRP over 33,000 but with 6,000 in rebates and Family pricing, came to just over 23,000. With some 10,000 off list, MONTEREY is an EXCEPTIONAL value ! Stable, quiet and smooth rider. Well appointed interior. Wood/chrome trim; dash chrome analog clock a ""showpiece"". With its long list of standard features, choosing Monterey over Freestar seemed like a ""no-brainer""; and compared to Toyota and Honda we saved thousands due to rebates/pricing not to mention just being able to afford a vehicle of this caliber ! This replaced a 2000 Ford Windstar and no comparison to the comfort and ""luxury"" feel of the Monterey. Really like this one !!"
mercury,monterey,2005,Bernard Murphy, 01/16/2005,Great MiniVan,4,"My decision to purchase the Mercury Monterey was based on the need first of all for a van.  Secondly, I needed a vehicle that could take a power lift to put my electric scooter in back (I am handicaped).    The Mercury Monterey was one of only a few vehicles that could handle the type of lift I needed. It is easy to enter, comfortable to drive, and filled with luxuries.  The engine is quite zippy and takes freeway speeds easily.  If someone wanted a dragster, they would not be in a van.  All in all a great vehicle."

My kids loved it!! didn't have any major problems with it and drove it from NJ to Florida each year. I bought it used and it was in great condition. I recently just had a terrible car accident and rolled it and all. It was amazing my whole family of 5 walked away. No one could believe it!! That car saved our lives!! I'm now trying to find another one used.

I told my wife she could pick out any van she wanted and load it up with any options she wanted. She picked the Monterey because of its looks mostly. But the cooled leather seats helped too! Plus, the huge rebates made the cost come down to like $25,000 for a van that stickered over $32,000."
mercury,monterey,2006,jersey montery owner, 12/14/2006,read before buying!,3,"We bought our Monterey during the ""employee Pricing"" campaign late last summer. Since then we have had several minor and major problems forcing us back to the dealership and to try to deal with Mercury direct. During our first extended trip, the LR wheel valve stem (obviously defective from the start as we only had about 800 miles at the time) went and we fought to have the resulting tire damage fixed by Merc to no avail. Gas mileage is extremely poor and I believe Ford/Merc are the only ones w/o a 60/40 split rear seat. We are now fighting turn signal switch issues and had to have a leak in the rear hatch fixed twice! TaKe a long hard look before buying!"
mercury,monterey,2006,jfturf, 08/23/2006,Bad MPG!,2,"It's very average and the gas mileage (13 mpg city) is horrendous.  Poorly placed cup holder for driver, poorly designed center console, too expensive for what it is.  3rd row seat is very close to the floor and is only suitable for small children.  Even a small adult would have his knees in his mouth sitting back there."

mercury,monterey,2006,Julie , 02/25/2006,The best van i have ever owned,5,"I have owned many vans in the past i have owned Mercury Villagers Ford Windstars and 1 Chrysler Town and Country and the Mercury Monterey is by far the best is has a smooth quiet ride and it handles like a luxury car would and i love the wood grain accents and the chrome door handles and door locks and i love the front design sporty on the outside yet elegent and luxurious on the interior and i like the 17"" rims and i like how everything is just at the push of a button you push a button and the slides open and the lift gate opens and so many more things i just love this van its so nice and sporty and i get many compliments on my van people say it looks great and i also love that 4.2L V6 "
mercury,monterey,2006,FL_Family, 02/20/2006,only one with Cooled seats !!!!,5,"if you live in the south like Florida here... you will understand that the cooled perforated leather seats are the only option you need to look for in a van... and this is the only van made that has them...  you will appreciate all the great others, like power doors, ultra-quiet highway ride, compass, dimming rear-view, memory seats, pedals, mirrors, etc etc... program yours or your spouses own code in the keyless door entry and it will adjust your seats to you or her when you enter you code to unlock the door... another push and all the power doors open up... it's just simply awesome, and the workers at the plant in canada are the most detail minded folks, they did it all with qualiy!!!"
mercury,monterey,2006,Love my Monterey , 04/01/2006,2nd Mercury Monterey,5,This is my second Mercury Monterey i got the first one in late 03 as a 04 model and it just keeps getting better so that why i purchased a 2006 Monterey it actually has more features than my 04 Monterey Premier and the 06 was cheaper in my opinion this is the best minivan out there its by far the best looking one outside and to me the best looking one inside to the interior materials are of great quality as well as the exterior the 4.2L V6 is very powerful it can easily get up to 70 in no time and the ride is great its extremely quiet and smooth and i love the colors dark red and black leather and i love the wood/leather steering wheel and everything else as well i highly reccommend this van
mercury,monterey,2006,Shawn, 09/08/2006,Great Van,4,"The Mercury Monterrey is hands down better than the Town and Country that I traded in on it.  The mileage is slightly better than the Town and Country and the van is of much better quality.  I liked the T&C but I love the Monterrey.  It has much more style, and is more appealing (interior and exterior."
mercury,monterey,2006,jdavis, 09/13/2007,Great for handicap,4,"We purchased ours in March 07. We were able to get it for 22K. At this price I think it was a steal. I am handicapped and we had it converted (VMI) to haul my power wheel chair. The Mercury has the widest opening Rt. side door 33"". My Powerchair and I are 600+ lbs. The 4.2L has plenty of power and rides smooth. The dual air helps to cool it off quickly which is a requirement in Phoenix 110 heat! My wife likes the front and rear sensors and the smooth ride. Performance and handling is good considering this is a MINI-VAN and not a Mustang! Would have liked better mileage, 15-16 city and 20 Highway."
mercury,monterey,2006,David Hall, 01/27/2019,A Jewel in 06,4,"Wowza!! Minivan exceeded expectations, did not have any pre-conceived notions, BUT van is a JEWEL. Bought as corporate lease w/62,000 miles. Now 100,800 miles, still in very good condition. Dealer in Knox., said very good condition, BUT age hurts re-sale. Expecting to get $,$$$.$$! Think it’s worth more due to condition.. Luxury Ed., all the bells & whistles, even for 06 model year..
"
mercury,monterey,2006,CotyC, 01/30/2020,Was Awesome van,2,"We bought our 2006 in 2018 but low miles.  The age shows compared to new vehicles. My wife loves the Van. Heated and cooled front seats. I'm 6'1"" wish the seat want back about 2"" more and down about 1"", then I would fit perfectly. I still fit good. This is the fanciest vehicle we have ever had. Smaller engine could have got better gas mileage and still had plenty of power. There is no shortage in engine power. We will be keeping this Van for a long time. 
Update July 2020
Transmission went out at 91,000 miles. We drive it like a mini van not a race car.  Come to find out these vans have crap transmissions. I'm done with Ford. Between this and our 2012 fiesta Ford has lost a loyal customer.

mercury,monterey,2007,Nathan , 12/01/2006,Mercury Monterey Luxury,4,My Mercury Monterey is excellent the ride and handling is super and the V6 Power is really great for passing or just getting up to speed The exterior style is sporty and classy and the interior is really nice i love the wood/leather steering wheel with audio controls everything works perfectly and there is plenty of passenger and cargo room the only thing i wish this van had that it doesn't is a NAV System and Satellite Radio But the thing i am most happy with is the comfortable smooth quiet ride and superb handling its awesome it really hugs the curbs and the dual climate control is there to make sure everyone is always comfortable I highly Recommend the Sporty yet Elegant Mercury Monterey..
mercury,monterey,2007,Mark , 07/07/2006,Greatest Van Out There,5,Ever since i purchased my 07 Monterey the more i drive it the more i love it because it handles extremely well and the ride is very quiet and smooth and the 4.2L V6 Engine is very powerful and can get up to 70 in just a few seconds and the interior is extremly roomy and comfortable and has tons of cargo room when the rear seats are folded down and everything is all power the rear doors are power the liftgate and the seats are dual power and the Montereys design inside and out is extremly classy and the quality of the materials are top of the line and the wood trim in the dash and chrome door handles and locks really set off the interior well as the wood in the steering wheel i love this van..
mercury,monterey,2007,Scott , 10/11/2006,The Luxurious Mercury Monterey,4,"Let me begin by telling you that the Mercury Monterey is without a doubt the best minivan on the market seeing how it comes with a standard 4.2L V6 (BIGGEST IN A MINIVAN)And standard leather seating and dual climate control and the wood/leather steering wheel and it has every available option offered by Mercury and the great looking norsea blue paint and 17"" rims make this van really stand out above the others and with the extremly smooth quiet ride i want to know why this is not the best selling van because the quality and reliablity is awesome. sure the price is high but its worth it because this is the best looking van inside and out and the only thing i dont is that i dont have 2 of them ."
mercury,monterey,2007,Kyle , 11/07/2006,Mercury Monterey Great American Made Van,4,My 2007 Mercury Monterey is awesome it has it all at the push of a button like dual power sliding doors dual power heated & cooled seats & dual climate control & a power liftgate the Monterey has a sporty exterior & a elegant interior with great looking wood and chrome trim accents & the little clock between the a/c vents look great & it has a great smooth ride & i really love going around sharp curves because the Monterey hugs them with ease & even going about 80 mph on the freeway the ride is extremely quiet & the powerful 4.2L V6 is really fast from the get up & go i love to floor it because i love that power and still get about 21 mpg i could not be happier with my Monterey i recommend it 
mercury,mountaineer,2000,ajs, 11/17/2009,One of many fans of this car,4," I learned from the dealer the 1999 to 2001 were the best built in this series and they have a strong following. I have found that out by talking to other owners. The Mountaineer is the top of the line. The V-8 engine is strong, transmission strong, solid body, has a truck feel (it is a Ranger w/ SUV body). With  Zaino polish the paint shines great and people are amaised it is 10 years old. This car is a solid performer, a great winter car. If I keep the rpm's under 2,000 on the interstate, I'll get 20.5 to 21.5 mpg. For good gas mileage drive with a soft foot on the accelerator. Fine a good one and keep it."
mercury,mountaineer,2000,jwdia, 08/26/2011,"Car has 147,000 miles and it drives like new",5,"Pros:
*At 147K miles engine and tranny sounds, and performs like brand new.
*They were not kidding about the V8 Power.
* Body well built and solid. Quality steel - no rust yet.
* AWD really grips the roads ( Iowa winters..no problem here)

Cons:
*Factory radio works but no display - common issue.
* rear wiper does not work - again common issue.
*Keyless entry quit working, and door locks need some TLC.
* some road noise. ( can't tell yet if it is in need of a muffler or just the roar of the 5.0)
* no rust yet but a little pain bubbling on the bottom inside of the rear doors. not noticable to the public"

mercury,mountaineer,2000,Bubba, 10/21/2016,2000 Mountaineer Premier-love it!,4,"I purchased this SUV knowing I would be the 3rd owner.  It had a history of 3 winters in Michigan and 10 years in VA.  There was some rust in the undercarriage around the spare tire connections and minor paint bubbles inside the rear door frame.  It had 73K miles on the 5.0L V8 w/AWD.  It now has 107K after 25 months and 2 winters of mid-Atlantic snow.  It has never failed to start and goes thru any kind of weather.  Regular maintenance of tires, battery, brakes, alternator and exhaust along w/some suspension worries probably due to MI weather history.  I also had the CHECK ENGINE light, annoying dashboard light and rear windshield wiper failures that others have noted.  I recently had to replace the fuel pump (also annoyingly located in the gas tank) and that fixed the Check Engine light.  This might sound like a lot to some folks but I love this vehicle.  It is roomy and leather luxurious and, as already mentioned, goes in any weather/road conditions.  I have mostly rural driving @ 14-17 MPG.  I'm hoping to keep this vehicle for a long, long time.

mercury,mountaineer,2000,chrishoops27, 08/11/2013,Love My 1st Car,4,"I just graduated high school and this is my 1st car. I got it from my grandpa who treated it very well and is in great condition.
It drives well, and the V8 is very powerful indeed. Granted, it does suck down a lot of gas in the city though hwy mileage is good.
Ride is pretty good, though on bumps it doesn't really take them well compared to a sedan would.
Excellent build quality, and everything; engine, transmission, electronics, they're all perfectly fine

I'm keeping it until it dies that's for sure"
mercury,mountaineer,2000,c2h6os, 12/04/2003,Solid Comfort,4,"Having owned a used 2000 Mercury 
Mountainerr for over 6 months, I am 
absolutely pleased with my decision to 
buy it.  The V8 power and AWD stability 
provide much relief for winter weather 
and towing/hauling/etc. The luxurious 
interior is the most comfortable I have 
known, even having driven Mercedes 
sedans and Chevy TrailBlazers."
mercury,mountaineer,2000,gregory wu, 01/22/2004,"Overall, a great suv.",4,"Aside from the gas mileage and the 
noisy moonroof, the car is solid as a 
rock, reliable, and powerful."
mercury,mountaineer,2000,Wildcat., 03/15/2004,2000 Mercury Mountaineer Review,4,"Fun, reliable vehicle. Handles well. 
Comfortable and well-designed interior. 
Gas mileage average (17/23) for V8."
mercury,mountaineer,2000,Realistic Reviewer, 12/14/2007,Realistic Review,4,"Vehicle handling is excellent considering this is a SUV on a truck chassis. I drive this vehicle lighting most of the time and it gives me a very acceptable ride. When thrown around a bit it does show that the suspension does not quite adapt well enough and does bounce around slightly too much. Off roading ability is great, but nothing too impressive. Can easily get around 14mpg city with smooth driving, around 12mpg letting it loose sometimes. Overall this is a very satisfying vehicle to all but the most discerning people."
mercury,mountaineer,2000,2000MMountain, 09/20/2002,Very good all around mid size suv,4,"I bought this vehicle when my puppy 
grew out of my car and it is very 
nice.  Hard to find aftermarket parts 
for except for the fact that most 2000 
explorer parts are interchangeable.  
Drives well, handles well, and good 
pickup for a heavy suv.  It does not 
absorb bumps like your independent 
rear suspension luxury suvs but its 
american built tough truck handling 
makes for a go anywhere kind of ride.  
Hit a curb..no biggie, off road..not a 
problem.  OEM tires are kind of 
crappy.  A nice set of Pirelli 
scorpion A/T and its all good.  All in 
All a 8 in my book."
mercury,mountaineer,2000,Rodney and Pam, 11/05/2002,I love it but I hate it too!,4,"I have had my 2000 Mountaineer for 1 
year.  The first week I had it the 
message center had to be replaced.  
Ok.  I can live with that.  I had an 
awful growning noise in the front end 
after several trips to the dealer the 
problem was the CV joints.  Now my big 
problem!  The transmission went out at 
50K!!!!   Now I have a rebuilt one and 
the SUV is for sale!  I love it and I 
don't want to give it up but what 
happens when my rebuilt trans goes out 
after the waranty is gone??  So I must 
say bye and I don't think I will buy 
another one."
mercury,mountaineer,2000,Lucky in Texas, 02/20/2004,Looks like new in 2004!,4,"I can't tell you how much I have loved 
this car!  At first I was a bit 
apprehensive about upgrading to an SUV 
from a '93 Saturn SL.  Once again I was 
one of the few that was able to get a 
2000 with a V6.  Condsidering all 
things the gas mileage is great!  Only 
problems I have is the radio display 
has gone out (a common problm in Ford 
products I hear) and the sensors for 
the Transmission are causing it to miss 
a little bit.  Other than that I can't 
tell you enough good things about it!"
mercury,mountaineer,2000,TreeHug, 03/21/2005,Best Ride Ever,5,"This is my most favorite vehicle I have ever owned. I enjoy the stylist leather interior, the beautiful dash and the cargo space.  I often time have to haul items for work and it makes it so easy to get things in and out.  Being a V-6 the good gas milage for this size of vehicle is wonderful.  It was great having 4- wheel drive this winter.  I live on a - dead-end gravel road that lacks snow removal and my Mountaineer got me through what ever snow.  I am having problems with the radio display.  "
mercury,mountaineer,2000,Trevor, 06/22/2005,The Best I Ever Had,4,"I have owned my Mountaineer for two years and NOT ONCE have I had a problem with it, other than the MACH radio screen going out, and that was quite minor. Mine is the Monterey edition (equivalent to Eddie Bauer edition of the Explorer). It has AMAZING acceleration, and gets decent gas mileage on the hwy, but not so much in the city. I plan to drive mine until the wheels fall off.  I've had a Nissan coupe and a Chevy Blazer, and this is BY FAR the best of the best. Contact me if you want to know anything about it."
mercury,mountaineer,2000,Moniquer, 06/30/2003,2000 Mercury Mountaineer,3,"Leased vehicle just turned in after 36 
months. Very good comfort, all the 
extras anyone could want, very 
comfortable interior. Quality was above 
average. Some initial build quality 
problems on interior trim and had the 
radio replaced under warranty during. 
Handling subpar although it is a truck. 
V8 gas mileage in city nowhere near as 
EPA advertised; 10-12 max. Highway 
mileage 18-20. "
mercury,mountaineer,2000,DRJ, 04/15/2010,2000 Monterey Wedgewood Blue & Gold,4,"Purchased used 8 years ago w/49,000 miles on it.  Now have 118,000 miles and only significant problems have been the transmission (torque converter) rebuild at 87,000, and as with many others, radio display went out - had repaired and then all button functions stopped working (original radio a real piece of junk!).  Replaced radio with newer OEM Ford radio w/6 cd changer from OEM Car Audio (on Ebay). Other than new tires , battery, brakes, shocks,serpentine belt, plugs and 13.7 avg mpg (mostly city), a pleasure to own and drive. Also a couple of minor factory recalls, big deal. At 118K miles, I've got a lot more to go! Body in excellent shape even after subjected to Minnesota winters & salt."
mercury,mountaineer,2000,Wardo, 08/05/2005,The best SUV,4,This is the best SUV Ford ever built. I plan on keeping this thing forever. Great on and off road capability. The 5.0l V8 is one the best engines that ever came from Detroit. Its acceleration is very surprising in a vehicle of this size. The performance and off-road uprgrades are plentiful.  Adding just a dual exhaust and a cold air intake makes this thing sound awesome. No problems yet and having AWD will hopefully stem some of the front end problems so associated with these vehicles.
mercury,mountaineer,2000,TBone, 08/13/2006,Ford can't do any better,4,"Whoever designed my Mountaineer should receive a Nobel prize.  I bought it with 48K in 2003, and it now has 96K and the only trouble I've had is a dead battery.  The radio display went out, and I dealt with it a while, but had it fixed for a high price.  It drives just the way it did when I bought it almost four years ago.  I've noticed my power locks acting up, but they aren't causing any bad problems.  Highway fuel economy is okay, but city is ugly."

mercury,mountaineer,2000,CMD7968, 08/07/2002,Impressive,4,"This is my first SUV.I can't believe I 
waited this long. There is so much more 
room than a sedane.I heard prior to 
purchasing that riding in a SUV was 
like riding a dirt bike. I totally 
disagree. The mountaineer is a smooth 
ride other than the occasional divet in 
road or rail road tracks.The factory 
stereo system is awesome.No need to 
install additional speakers etc. The 
gas mileage is Okay but I have always 
drove a 4-cylinder or 6-cylinder car, 
so this being 8-cylinder of course uses 
more gas.Love the extra vents for air 
w/ controls in the back seat.The only 
thing I dont like is when my husband

this vehicle, and the AWD works very 
well in snow. The only problem I've had 
is that the check engine light comes on 
all too often, and the dealership does 
nothing to repair the problem except to 
turn the light off and then charge a 
large bill for a service that takes 5 
minutes"

mercury,mountaineer,2000,skp369, 09/19/2003,Not Bad,4,"I have enjoyed driving this truck for 
almost three years.  I was very 
suprised and impressed at its very good 
performance and handling on dry roads 
as well as deep snow. The V-8 is strong 
and steering is excellent.  The 2000 
Mountaineer has one problem area and 
that is its ride.  The leaf spring rear 
suspension causes an uncomfortable ride 
on any but the smoothest roads.  It has 
proven very reliable and adaptable to 
most uses."
mercury,mountaineer,2000,Totally Satisfied, 11/15/2003,I love my Mountaineer,5,"I purchased one of the few 2000 models 
with a V-6.  This is the best vehicle I 
have ever owned.  I now have over 90K 
miles on my vehicle with no problems.  
I have pulled a trailer a lot and done 
a lot of city driving on a regular

mercury,mountaineer,2000,LibbyTFerguson, 10/22/2004,Love it much!,4,"I actually love the ""bumpy"" truck ride 
of my 2000 Mercury Mountaineer.  I will 
be so bummed out when I need a new one 
and have to settle for the smoother 
ride.  But, I don't know if I will ever 
buy another type of vehicle EVER 
again.  It is my favorite of all time 
and I was one of those girls in the 
late 80's early 90's who had a Chrysler 
LeBaron convertable.  Mine was even 
manual turbo transmission with cruise 
control!  My dealer keeps sending me 
notices saying ""We want your 2000 
Mountaineer, it's in demand!"" I know 
it's a ploy to get me to buy a new car,

it from me.  What a TRUCK!  XXXOOO to

Seems solid and reliable. Only minor issues so far (rear wiper stopped working twice & digital display on radio goes crazy now and then). My gas mileage is lower than expected based upon other reviews, but I drive a lot of short distances with a lot of steep hills. I get about 10-12 in town, 18-20 on highway. But I did not expect much more from a V8 AWD. Other features are great and I have been generally quite pleased with the purchase."

I have not had any problems at all. I love the options this vehicle has at the affordable price. After driving a Chevy previously, I was a little apprehensive about buying a Ford. I found it to be just as reliable, if not more than my Chevy.  Sadly, I am trading it in due to the gas mileage.  I wish I did not have to commute 30 miles one way to work, or I would keep this precious gem. I would  advise anyone to buy a Mountaineer!"

a terrific job with the quality of this

mercury,mountaineer,2000,Jolin, 04/20/2010,Sad to see it go,4,"I've had my SUV for over 5 years now and it's the best thing I've ever owned.  Never once left me stranded & only had to fix normal things like tires, battery, brakes, & spark plugs.  Would love to keep it but the family is too big and we need a 3rd row now.  If I could buy new I would just order one that way.  I think I will cry when I trade in this week.  Currently at 92,000 miles and still going strong.  Back wiper never quite worked right & light bulb issue on the dash but the stuff that really mattered and would cost a lot to fix stayed strong.  Hope to own another one some day."
mercury,mountaineer,2000,sdinnis, 08/07/2002,After 2 and a half years ....,4,"... I still enjoy driving my 
Mountaineer. The one gripe I have is 
that there seems to be a rattle coming 
from the passenger side when I go over 
bumps/tracks, etc. Dealer has looked at 
it several times and not been able to 
fix it (or recreate it consistently). 
But the ride is nice and comfortable 
and the V8 has more power than I would 
ever need even for towing small 
trailers. Makes me kinda wish I had 
gone for the V6 for better gas mileage. 
It's design both in and out is very 
appealing. It handles like a truck 
(duh!) which limits it's fun factor to 
drive but if you wanted fun, you 
wouldn't be getting a big SUV."

17-20 hwy MPG.I added the Tornado to 
see if it would help(Very little).
I have problems with the anti-theft not 
letting it start at times which is 
probably moisture related.I really 
wanted to buy a 2001 Aztek GT which was 
fully loaded but was afraid of the 
glitches of newer model productions.The 
Aztek was the same price.Even though 
this Mountaineer is certified.I wish I 
would have had it inspected at another

different reviews I decided to purchase 
a used 2000 Mountaineer/Premier in deep 
wedgewood blue at a dealership near me. 
I had an AWD/Turbo sports car before 
and the Mountaineer AWD with the 5.0/V8 
has all the power that I need. This SUV 
exceeded my expectations! It has the 
most comfort features than any other 
mid-size SUVs out there and the ride 
quality is excellent. I highly 
recommend this SUV."

couldn't find the right Eplorer

Only major issue ever was a transfer case at about 200K. Normal wear and tear like rotars, pads and a couple alternaters. Changed the oil every 6 or 7K! Found a second 2001 model with 50K in 2005. Still using it as daily with 304K! Ford fixed the transfer case problem after 1998 so no issues at all with this one. Rotars, front barings one alternator and thats it. Better half got tired of looking at it so today I went out to look at F150's. Came across a 2000 model Mountaineer with 102K like new. Pick it up from the dealer in 2 days.

Price paid was $2,700. This vehicle was apparently well maintained however upon purchase I had all the fluids changed. The only other thing I've done to it is replace plug wires and coil packs and fuel filter. I really like the interior design and features. For the year of the vehicle the technology was well thought out. Leather seats and moonroof too. Gas mileage is terrible but I really don't care about gas mileage in purchasing a vehicle. I am more concerned about longevity and reliability. The 5.0 v8 idles smooth as silk and this vehicle has plenty of power and torque. I have thought about selling or trading this vehicle a few times but cannot bring myself to do it. Overall this vehicle has been an excellent value for the money.

The 2001 Mountaineer was a bargain due to the intro. of the all new 2002 model.  This truck was sold new in Oct. of 2000, so it had about 18 months of service.  We were able to get a 5 year 75,000 mile warranty (from date of original delivery) so we have 3-4 more years of coverage due to the fact it was a 2001 vehicle still covered by the orignal factory warranty."
mercury,mountaineer,2001,kuhny, 06/11/2008,Love this vehicle,4,"I just purchased my  2001 Mountaineer about 2 months ago, and I love it. So far I love the 5.0 V8 lots of power, love the leather seats, power moonroof, the way it handles, and just the overall vehicle. Mine has 55,000 miles on it and sure there will be plenty more fun miles. Tows my trailer and family just fine. Downfalls are the display on radio (easy fix) and the gas mileage, but you are driving an AWD SUV. Gets about 15 in town and 20-22 mpg highway, still better than my Jimmy (and it was a V6). I am very satisfied with this vehicle so far, will buy another one when time."

very satisfied with the SUV's 
performance and quality. The only 
drawback has been the gas mileage which 
is extremely bad (5.0 liter engine and 
AWD). The overall ride comfort is good 
even though you should expect that this 
will ride like a truck....because 
essentially, it is. Cargo room is 
sufficient for most needs and the leg 
room between seats is satisfactory. The 
climate control feature works perfectly 
and in this particular model, the rear 
seat area can even control the climate. 
The one question most folks want to 
know following a review is 
usually, ""would you buy it again""? My 
answer: most definitely."

My 4.6 has well over 120,000 miles on it and I never had any transmission problems. (Yes, never).
The tranny shifts fast and has good gear ratios which enable this suv to have really quick acceleration. And all of the people that say this car has a terrible fuel economy probably drive too aggresively.
We took this car out for a very long highway trip and we averaged over 20mpg during the trip and our car had 4-5 people inside, full trunk of heavy bags, and our avg. speed was over 70mph. Mixed Mpg with mostly city driving ranges from low to high teens."

However, I get regular oil changes, change the air filter regularly, clean the engine once in a while, etc...my only complaints are 1) the engineers who designed this vehicle did not put a governor on the accelerator, and sometimes when you take your foot off and coast, the gears shift down with a ""thunk,"" instead of gradually, but this doesn't do any harm to the tranny, and 2) i had problems early-on with the vent system in the rear (3rd row seats). it makes a clicking noise sometimes, like the fan motor isn't working.

Boyfriend was driving the car after a long day of hiking, I was in the passenger seat.

mercury,mountaineer,2002,amkrug2, 08/12/2014,Longest Lasting SUV in this family,4,"My father bought this car in '03 with just over 30k miles on it. Being a repo, there were a couple small problems that the dealership happily fixed, such as a new steering wheel (Lady who owned before broke all the buttons) and one seat replaced. We modified the intake by putting an aftermarket spectre cold air intake on it, but besides that is totally stock. This car lasted like that for 160k miles. The transmission was starting to slip and the front hubs needed attention. We went ahead and replaced them. Now, mind you, nothing ever broke, we just went ahead and replaced before they did. 62k miles later, it broke down for the first time and was just the pump. She is still going strong!"
mercury,mountaineer,2002,LMO, 11/27/2010,Sweet & Sour,3,"I bought this vehicle new and maintained it.  At 38,000 miles the transmission needed to be replaced.  Unacceptable. After threatening to protest at the dealer, they discounted the cost. 50,000 miles later, that one went too. Ford couldn't care less. This in my opinion is not normal. Even the dealer service agreed and they were equally frustrated with Ford HQ. I really had no other complaints besides the disappointing gas mileage however, like I've read in other reviews, I've lost my faith with American cars especially Ford. I'm afraid to chance it.  With 130,000 miles being on the 3rd tranny, it's time to start looking.While I still can't really find anything I like as much, I'll skip Ford."

Mountaineer! The comfort and handling 
are vastly improved.  I am glad my old 
lease was up."
mercury,mountaineer,2002,MarkR, 04/21/2002,02' Mountaineer nicely re-designed,3,"I've only driven my Mountaineer about 
4,000 miles so far.  Design wise it's a 
heck of a lot better vehicle than my 
old 94' Explorer.  The more I look at 
the outside, the more pretentious it 
strikes me.  Still... I've received 
alot of compliments on it's looks.  It 
handles great and has alot of those 
handy little storage spaces.  I was a 
little nervous about going from 4WD to 
AWD but the thing was great in the 
snows of Vermont.  It does occasionally 
knock slightly on regular gas but it 
seems like a good strong engine for a 6 
cylinder. Overall I'm very happy with 
it."
mercury,mountaineer,2002,Mark, 08/27/2008,"A lot of plusses, two big minuses",4,"My Mountaineer is the basic design with the V-8. No other frills.  Fun to drive. Excellent smooth ride. Great stereo. Nice and dependable A/C. In all a great car to take the long distance as I have driven about 155K miles - mostly highway. Two big minuses:  Transmission and rear axle. The right rear axle losing its fluid and freezing up could be chalked up to back luck. However, the bad transmission is a systemic problem for most of these Merc's. The local transmission mechanic told me this. One would be lucky to get in 50K miles. Mine started going bad around 40K, but not bad enough to use the drivetrain warranty - according to the dealer."
mercury,mountaineer,2002,GeorgeT, 04/22/2002,AWD - Awesome Worldbeater Drive,4,"I wanted a 7 seater that could pull my 
3000lb boat. I got the V8 with side 
curtain air bags and tow package, white 
pearlescent with tan interior.Everybody 
thinks it looks great.
  It is  still not broken in but I am 
already getting 14 mpg around town and 
I have a heavy foot.The rear seat has 
lots of room and it is easy to 
enter .The transmission shifts 
beautifully and the V8 has lots of 
power."

My mechanic says it is because the all time awd is not good on the highway vehicles are not made to be in 4 wheel at such high speeds.  The transmission is now slipping.  And I still owe $9000 on it.  Do not buy this truck you will regret it.  I bought myself a beater as it is much cheaper to fix than the problems with this truck meanwhile I own a 13,000 dollar paperweight!"

so good.  The ride is very smooth for a

cheaper."

I never ever buy domestic cars, but needed a 7 seater so decided to go with the Mountaineer. 2 weeks into purchasing the car, the wheel bearing went out, so that was replaced by Ford at no charge. 2 years later the transmission went out on me. I had to fight it thru corp to get the dealership to fix it thru the warranty.  It's been 2 years since I had that replaced, the transmission is starting to stall at 20-30 miles again, so another tranny problem comes. There should be a recall on transmission on these cars. If I have to replace 2 already in 4 years. "
mercury,mountaineer,2002,Steve D., 02/01/2009,Solid Performer,4,"Purchases about two years ago with about 50K miles. Now at 120K and and very happy with purchase. Two repairs - one front wheel bearing at about $300 and a $600 complete brake job (front/rear rotors, and rear calipers). Otherwise, no problems. I do mostly highway driving and get about 20-21mpg with a V8 consistently. Comfortable ride. Good quality build. Amazingly, after 120K miles, no rattles or squeaks! Styling still looks fresh after 7 years. Bottom line - very solid SUV and a very good value."

mercury,mountaineer,2002,Terrell.le, 08/23/2009,headache in disguise,2,"i bought my 2002 mercury mountaineer used in January of 2009, Truck did good for 2 hours then the both the front wheel bearings went. Shortly after the dealership fixed this problems i was back in the shop again. The power steering pump went along with the rack and pinion. I have only purchased the mountaineer 2 weeks prior. I made it another month until the transmission blew out on my on the expressway. Took the dealership 10 days to rebuild my new transmission and it still shifts kinda funny. Now 5 months later and the front differential is beginning to go, thanks god for extended warranties! Word of advise for anyone buying this model, DON'T! Save yourself the trouble!"
mercury,mountaineer,2002,Suzi, 10/04/2009,The usual transmission problems,3,"I see the 06 has tranmission problems, they started long before that, luckily I bought an extended warranty because the Mountaineer was in the shop every 3 months for 3 years.  It got to the point where the mechanics would groan when they saw me walk in the door.  If a manufacturer knows there is a long standing existing problem, they should fix it under warranty and not make the customer fight constantly. Don't plan to make my next vehicle a ford/mercury, too bad really because I come from a long line of ford dealers."
mercury,mountaineer,2002,Mommy to 3 , 10/08/2009,Great until you hit 80k,2,"We bought this car in 2004. I loved it for the first two years or so. The it started falling apart. We have had to replace the transmission and it needs to be replaced again now. Other replacements, power window motor and switch pannel, window regulator, back glass, wheel barings, door hinges, cracked running boards, air compressor, power seat motor and various timing belts. I have just been advised the ABS is out and my rear end may or may not be going out and the doors no longer lock. Interior wise it's comfy. Some of the paint on the steering wheel and radio started peeling and flaking at about 50k. Basically this car is junk. We are trading in tomorrow on a Land Rover LR3 tomorrow"
mercury,mountaineer,2002,lucky, 12/03/2009,Poor design,2,"From reading reviews I guess I am lucky. I have a 2002 Mountaineer purchased new with about 77000 miles right now. The rear suspension rotted out on it 500.00 to repair, and now the ignition cylinder fell apart. 101.00 labor at the dealer and 100.00 for the part.About one hour labor. I am 62 years old and will be buying another new vehicle this year, but not a ford product. Toyota always has some vehicles in car and driver american made list. Which is why I did just purchase a new Toyota Tundra and will probably buy a Toyota car of some model."

Replaced tranny at 105000 miles.  I use a K&N air filter and installed a 'Tornado' air mixer thing; I get close to 19/20 mpg.  I change oil 3 mo/3000 miles.  I pass emissions test annually in GA. On third set of tires, they wear evenly.  Ride is comfortable, especially on long trips.  It does good for 'taxi' service.

Soon after we bought it we had to pay almost $2000 to have the rear axles fixed, a couple years later we had to replace the back A/C unit & some other parts, and that was another $2000 +.  I just found out yesterday that my transmission is going out!  I am really frustrated with Ford.........I won't make this mistake again, it's Nissan or Toyota for me!!!!!!!!!!"
mercury,mountaineer,2002,Dane LaGrow, 12/29/2009,Transmission and drive train problems,2,Ford used many poor quality parts on my vehical. Replaced fuel pump.Replaced both rear springs(broke in man spots).Rear wheel bearings. Transmission had to be rebuilt twice.  Transmission was rebuilt at Schmit Bros.Ford in Saukville wi. at 83000 miles. The transmission failed again at 112000 miles. They refused to stand behind there work.The owner said they installed Ford parts and it was Fords fault the transmission failed.I contacted Ford and they refused to stand behind Schmit Bros work.  We have not had the tranmission repaired yet. This is the last Ford I will ever Buy.

This vehicle has had both rear wheel bearings replaced before the warranty ran out, constant transmission issues, rear axel leaking oil, rear coil spring broken, and it blew a spark plug out the head last week. Not to mention all the sensors replaced. We won't be buying this brand any more."

mercury,mountaineer,2002,scooter, 04/16/2010,Motor and Rear Axle problems,4,"Had to replace front rotors and brakes when we first bought it.  Makes a roaring noise because real axle is bad.  At 110,000 miles lost all oil and motor went out, oil warning light never came on so I had no idea I had lost all the oil.  We replace the motor and now have tranny problems.  Also it has a water leak somewhere and have water stains on the seats that won't come out."
mercury,mountaineer,2002,Viper Guy, 04/29/2010,Pretty Good a 140k,4,"Yes, I've had problems, but overall it's been good.  The transmission was an issue, as is common.  Mine went out at around 60k miles.  The bill was about $2k, but Ford covered all but $500 and gave me extended coverage of the entire drive train to 100k miles. Okay, so my rear axle started leaking and i had to repair the clutches and bearings just recently.  Also, I had to replace the front bearings last year. At over 100k miles, I'm not sure what people expect.  It doesn't bother me that those problems came up at that point.  I also had a couple of oil leaks. The paint is still in great shape, as well as the interior, the AC is cold as ever, engine runs great.  It looks as good as new SUVs."
mercury,mountaineer,2002,mfultz, 05/22/2010,A Lemon's Lemon,2,"I really tried to buy American when I bought this Mountaineer with only 38,00 miles on it in 2004.  Now at 90,000 miles I have had to replace the transmission and not the rear end is failing.  I have a Toyota Tundra and a Honda they have 106,000 miles and 170, miles on them respectively.  I have NEVER replace a transmission or differential on either one.  I just think I should have gotten more service out of this Mountaineer; after all, I thought American car manufacturers PROMISED to build better products. The promised has truly been broken, just like my pocketbook.  NO MORE AMERICAN vehicles for me, and that's a promise."
mercury,mountaineer,2002,mfultz, 05/24/2010,A Real Let-Down,2,"I bought this 2002 Mountaineer in 2004 with about 37,000 miles.  Initially, I was impressed with the car, especially the 3-row seat.  About a year later on a trip from LA to San Francisco, I noticed an ""clunking"" in the transmission.  We really do not drive the car except on long family outings because we have two other smaller, more economical cars.  Now at 89,000 both the transmission and the rear axle have gone out.  Trans cost $2600; rear end $600.  Now I see people indicating there are suspension problems.  I am terrified.  This is not American! Ford has numerous complaints about trans. Problems.  The American thing to do, Ford, would be to back your product! Shame, shame, shame!"

mercury,mountaineer,2002,Jberezo, 06/27/2002,Awesome Mountaineer,5,"It definitely has a few more options 
than the Explorer, like an underseat 
storage area in the second row.  So 
when Ford announced a 2250 cash back 
rebate, my wife and I went looking.  
She likes the styling much better, I 
guess Ford would like that, it was 
suppose to be designed for women.  
There were WAY more Mountaineer's 
around than fancy Explorer's too, which 
helped us get exactly what wanted.  We 
got the Premier Edition, which has dual 
exhaust, satin nickel luggage rack, 17"" 
wheels and tires.  She calls me several 
times a day to tell me how much she 
loves it.  She did NOT want an SUV.  
She is so surprised at how much she 
likes it."

At 140,000 miles it needed a transmission and transfer case - think my son learning to drive had something to do with that. Now at 220,000 miles, it's time to replace it. We really don't know what to but next. We prefer Mercurys, but Ford is ending that. Mariner? Too small. Ford Edge? Pricey. Maybe we won't sell the Mountaineer!"

performs well except gas milage.  
However we have had this SUV in the 
shop 9 times in one year.  3 times for 
seat belt clip.  3 times for air 
conditionier finally figured out the 
air compressor was leaking feron so 
they had to replace compressor.  Check 
engine light keeps coming on.  Door 
hinge on drivers side keeps coming 
loose and squeaking like a worn out car.
Back hatch latch kept coming apart.  
Finally that was fixed.  We are at the

happy next."

years.  I like the styling as opposed 
to the 2002 Explorer.  I also like the 
fact that not everyone has a 
Mountaineer.  Our's is equiped with the 
4.0 6cyl. We have made a couple of 
trips and averaged 20.1 MPG.  I commute 
32.0 miles to work a day and average in 
town/commute driving I get 18.5 to 18.7 
MPG at 65 MPH.  Comfort and Convience 
are all excellent.  AWD makes for some

They don't know why it has been destroyed in 400 miles.  Already paid around 3k, they say this repair will be 5-6k.  Trying to fight with previous place that did repair, but appears to be a problem with the design of the drive train!!  Do not buy one of these.  Pure nightmare."

Ford has recalled this transmission, but not on a mountaneer. 2)the fake metal trim is just cheap paint on tan plastic. 3)the 4L V6 needs to be trashed (just spent $500 to fix a CEL and do regualar maintance).4)don't buy for fuel economy.5)The interior parts are garbage.

problem.  My 6'2"" son often rides in 
the third seat and has plenty of leg 
room."
mercury,mountaineer,2002,Pchampi, 02/02/2004,Good all-around family vehicle,4,"We were won over by the styling and 
additional features of the Montaineer, 
most notably the standard third row 
seat for hauling around the relatives 
and little league team on occassion.  
The Mountaineer handles this task 
admirably, with suprisingly good 
legroom and comfort for the third row 
seat. The independent rear suspension 
provides a very comfortable ride, and 
the 5.0L V-8 is very peppy with good 
torque for trailer pulling. Very smooth 
riding and extra stable at highway 
speed. Quality has been excellent. 
Mileage of 17 to 20 Mpg could be a bit 
better, but overall the truck has 
provided a very enjoyable ownership 
experience."
mercury,mountaineer,2002,winevisit, 02/14/2004,2002 Mercury Moutaineer,4,"Excellent SUV that is fun to drive. 
Great ride and handling. The only 
complaints that I have are lack of leg 
room for 2nd row passengers and lousy 
gas mileage. Very reliable, virtually 
zero problems."

everyone comments on the good looks of 
the vehicle."

cold and my husband is always hot (now 
we well both be comfortable). "
mercury,mountaineer,2002,sucker, 06/07/2006,Transmission is Terrible!,3,"I love this SUV's design and ride.  I HATE THE TRANSMISSION!  I've had it in the shop numerous times with transmission issues - bad sensors, replaced parts, etc etc. Now it shudders when shifting into overdrive and has started to shift hard when in first gear or going into reverse. Guess what? Just told by delearship that I need a new transmission!  I've had 3 Fords/Mercurys over the years and 3 Fords/Mercurys with transmission problems.  I won't be a buy of theirs again.  FIX YOUR PROBLEM FORD!!!"
mercury,mountaineer,2002,BKB, 05/06/2004,Best vehicle ever owned,4,"With 54K miles absolutely no problems 
with anything. Original tires still 
holding out great. Love the third seat 
and numerous available options. We 
bought the 6 cylinder and with current 
gas prices it turns out to be the best 
better choice ( V8 engine only provides 
about 15 more hp)."
mercury,mountaineer,2002,Mountain Woman, 06/22/2004,Disappointed in Ford,4,"I love this truck.  The third row seat 
is very comfortable and handy.  I hate 
that we've had to have the back window 
replaced because we got a crack in the 
frame right above the Mercury emblem.  
The most disappointing thing of all is 
that the rear end had to be replaced at 
around 24,000 miles and now again at 
58,000 miles.  Ford paid for the first 
replacement but refuses to cover this 
one.  Also, the door hinge on the front 
passenger side keeps getting loose.  
Even though I have owned two Explorers 
and now this Mountaineer that I love, I 
will NEVER purchase another Ford 
product again.  Ford does not stand 
behind their products."

I had a 1997 Taurus, it needed a new transmission at 39k miles, Ford was not going to cover it initially, then I screamed and yelled and they covered it.  This Mercury had MAJOR electrical issues at 45k miles, Ford said too bad not covered.  The dealer ended up covering it for me.  Now, the transmission on the Merc is out at 49k miles. Junk Junk JUNK.  No more Fords for me."
mercury,mountaineer,2002,M. Fitzgerald, 03/11/2005,Mountaineer is Solid,4,Solid vehicle through and through.  This has been everything and more that I could have wanted in an SUV.  You MUST have a V8 though.
mercury,mountaineer,2002,Cheryl Huff, 03/20/2005,I love my mountaineer,5,"I have driven a truck for almost 20 years and just love this suv.  I wasn't really looking for an suv, but when I was looking at trucks saw this mountaineer and liked the looks.  It gets good gas mileage. Looks great! Goes through snow or mud and handles on ice. The only problem I've had was when I got so much mud on it that it clogged the windshield washer and the mud got in the door latch."
mercury,mountaineer,2002,Mel, 03/24/2005,Mel's Review,4,I have only had this vehicle for a week. However I feel it is a good and reliable vehicle. It is also very classy looking. I had an Expedition prior to this and it was not good on gas at all. I can truly tell a difference.
mercury,mountaineer,2002,OneThunderbird, 06/06/2005,Transmission Problems Again,3,"This could be a good SUV if Mercury would fix know problems with the Transmission. Back to the dealer for the fourth time with OD Light flashing and Service Light on. Dealer claims it takes days to recieve parts and then after installing, the same problems return. Gas Mileage is awfull and paint failing. We no longer trust this SUV as it fails to shift and has stalled several times while in traffic."
mercury,mountaineer,2002,Tom, 07/16/2005,Bad Tranny,4,"Nice SUV, the V8 is a must.  Lots of power for towing.  I had a 1997 with the 5.0 and the 4.6L is a much better engine.  However the transmission is aweful.  Clunks, and has troulbe shifitng.  Had it in several time and the problem is still there.  Looking to sell."
mercury,mountaineer,2002,Donald Steiner, 11/03/2005,Never buying american car again,2,"I had a 3 year lease on 98 mountaineer. Absolutely loved the way it drove.I would frequently drive between Canton,Ohio and San Jose. I was very sad to part with it. Looked at acura mdx,jeep grand cherokee and lexus rx300. Nothing blew me away more than the redesigned mountaineer. My company gave me a corporate discount towards any ford motor vehicle. This made the mountaineer an even more ideal choice. I now feel ashamed that i leased it. At 10000 miles the cheap vinyl on the seats started to wear out as if it had 50,000 miles. At 15,000 miles i started having computer glitches. the dealer attempted to fix it 8 times before the lease was up. It never did get the problem fixed. I am now an audi bigot."
mercury,mountaineer,2002,Brooks Gardner, 12/21/2005,Nice vehicle for the money,4,My wife and I love our 2002 Mountaineer.  We also have a 1998 that is still in excellent condition.  V8 in both with most extras on both.  The 2002 has everything you would ever want.  2002 has great power and very smooth and quite ride.  I only get to drive it when my wife is off work that day.
mercury,mountaineer,2002,R. J. Robinson, 02/13/2006,We love our Mountaineer,5,"It handles well and there have been almost 0 problems since we bought it.  The outside paint job has held up like it is still new (and it is not a garaged car).  We bought it new 5 1/2 years ago and the only thing we notice as it ages is that the ""quietness"" in the ride that was first there is beginning to wane, but not real noticable. "
mercury,mountaineer,2002,Erie, Pa,No major problems yet.,3,"Looked for an SUV for a long time. Chose because of price and Explorer reputation. So far have had minor problems with the vehicle not being able to start. After three tows, found out it was bad ground wire. vehicle sometimes seems to lag into gear from park when cold. Also transmission at times acts like something is going wrong. Have 75,000 mile warranty, hope it goes before then. A fine vehicle otherwise, gas mileage around town is 13 and highway is poor at only 18. Questionable whether I would buy another. Also seat foam on drivers seat began to bunch up along left part of seat, I dont weigh a whole lot over 170. Had to have it taken off and fixed. $125.00"

mercury,mountaineer,2002,Alex, 03/19/2006,my review,4,i like it.  it runs good and had plenty of room.  folding 3rd row seat is great.  fuel mileage isn't the best in town.
mercury,mountaineer,2002,Twice bitten, 06/12/2006,repairs,3,"I love the way this vehicle drives, I love the way it handles and the comfort.  However, I hate the repair cost!  I've had small transmission problems starting at 41k. At 77k , I spent 1400 in repairs.  Today, I forked over $2100 for a new transmission at 106k miles.  If that's not painful enough, the differential (sp?) was also shot! My repair fellow said he sees this on the Explorer and Mountaineers- I've never heard of those going bad?  After $1100 for that, I can promise you that I won't be a repeat purchaser of a Ford product.  I had a Windstar prior to the Mountaineer. My trans went out at 38k on that and was going out again at 110k when I got rid of it for the SUV. "

mercury,mountaineer,2002,Herb, 02/04/2007,Watch Out for Transmission,3,"Loved the way it looks and drives.  I have a V8 and pulled a camper with no problems.  The AWD, 6CD Changer, Heated Seats, and Memory settings work well.  The only problem is the transmission.  Had it replaced after the warranty went out.  Now it's slipping again.  Supposedly, later models improved the transmission."
mercury,mountaineer,2002,tim, 08/15/2007,2002 horrible Mountaineer,2,"Our Mountaineer has 67,700 miles on it and the transmission already has to be rebuilt. The transmission shop told me there was nothing that I did wrong or I could of done to prevent it, that this is a commom problem with this transmission. The dealership and Ford won't help us because the warranty is up. I contacted The National Traffic and Highway Safety Administration and made a formal complaint. If you have any problems with yours please do the same it only takes 10 to 15 minutes. "
mercury,mountaineer,2002,Wendy, 10/19/2007,Love my Mountaineer,5,"I bought my Mountaineer as a program car and have been extremely happy with it. In the 4 1/2 years that I have owned it, my repair bills have been minimal. I have had brake work done twice, purchased tires one time, and purchased one battery.  There are now 113,500 miles on the car and it is still going strong.  Everyone in my family loves driving it. I am considering getting a new car in the future (just because I want a new car), and we will probably keep this vehicle for a spare.  It just seems too good to give up. I have never had such good service out of a vehicle."
mercury,mountaineer,2002,gabrielu, 10/24/2007,"2002 Mountainer, surprised by quality",4,"Wife loved it at first sight but later wanted a smaller car, so I have driven it for the last five years.  We occasionally think about selling it but do not.  I have never had a problem with the car other than very minor issues (door open sensor, heated seat) both inexpensive to fix.  Otherwise I have just changed oil regularly and done the 60k checkpoint (not much there either).  Is my first Ford and I am completely turned around on old perception.  We have a Mercedes and a Toyota in the family, The former is a money pit, the latter is good but feels so much cheaper. We are almost at 100k and cannot find a good reason to sell it.  I guess I got the lucky one "

It drives, corners, and handles great.  The V-8's fuel economy is not the greatest but I love the get-up-and-go it has when merging on freeways or trying to pass.  The interior dash display is awesome at night. Coming from a snowy state I love the all-wheel-drive.  No worrying about when to switch to 4-wheel drive, and it appears to work great.  In 8 months of driving not a single concern."
mercury,mountaineer,2002,ajktopdawg, 11/13/2007,Great SUV to own,4,"I have owned my 02 Mountaineer for 2 years. Traded into it from a 96 BMW 328i convertable. Granted, its not a BMW with as speed or open air, but makes up for many other options.  The only issue I had was an alarm sensor went bad a 50k miles and that cost me $120 at the dealer to fix. 20 mpg on the hwy at 75 mpg is as good as you get with 5 speed automatic. Front seat is hard and can hurt sitting too long. Plenty of HP and get up and go, quicker than my wife's 3.8 Mustang and thats an 03!"
mercury,mountaineer,2002,Angela, 11/27/2007,Nice Looking Nightmare,3,"In looks and comfort, this is a great vehicle. Repairs have been plenty. Had all 4 wheel bearings replaced at 80k miles, then front differential, rear differential seals, driveshaft and transfer case all replaced at 90k miles. At 107k miles, it is back in the shop for new front differential and transfer case. This truck is a money pit and will be used in helping me to buy my new Toyota. It is comfortable though but that doesn't help me if I can't drive it anywhere."

up. the drive, the handling, the looks inside/out, the quality and firmness of 
ride is outstanding. Rides as well as the Land Rover for 2x the price of the 
Mountaineer and I like the styling better. Its fun to drive, stable and the front 
end stands out as a dressy explorer. I have gotten lots of compliments on it

The V6 is adequate for my uses but a dog on gas consumption.  The ride is not as choppy as my 1998 Explorer.  I love the exterior appearance.
mercury,mountaineer,2002,Frank, 04/10/2008,Newbee,3,"We bought this and a week 1/2 later the transmission warning was on, cost us 1500 and 4 trips to fix the issue.

mercury,mountaineer,2002,FIRST SUV, 03/28/2002,AFFORDABLE SUV WITH HIGH PRICE STYLE,4,"I found the Mountaineer to drive and handle better than the land cruiser

is better than my concorde lxi, very stable handling, and lots of bells
and whistles. controls are easy. I found the design to be a sophisticated
explorer and get lots of compliments from co workers on its look.
With the features and safty features that murcury has included its hard
to find competition in the same class. I am happy with the purchase.
Only defect was the CD player fade/bal buttons had a mind of their own
and the dealer swapped it out with out waiting."

I've always driven my vehicles hard and I can say for just being a 4.0L it is a workhorse. I've hauled thousands of pounds of supplies behind it in a trailer, driven off-road,done a few donuts, you name it. I bought it out of pure necessity having a third child on the way. This is my grocery/camping/work/family vehicle. I love the sound system and leather seats and 17 inch wheels. It handles great and has good power for passing. It has 109,000 miles now and all I've had to replace was an alternator. I also nailed a deer at about 50 mph and virtually no damage. I have no regrets. "
mercury,mountaineer,2003,Pat, 03/03/2010,The Good and not so good,4,"The Comfort, looks and performance are Great. The Problems are few but Should be weeded out by the Mercury engineers: 1) I purchased this SUV new and have the towing package but have never used it yet the 2 rear springs are broken. Never overloaded it either. Can't figure out why/how this happened. 2) Rear tailgate has a plastic body part with Mercury emblem on it. It cracked even though there was no accident. Heard of other owners having same problem. Why did/does this happen? 3)  Power windows freeze up in winter will not work until they are thawed out.    Overall I like this SUV. It's a pleasure to drive. Hopeful that some Mercury People will see my remarks here and find solutions"

I own a 2003 Mountaineer Premier AWD V8 with stock GoodYear Fortera HL tires and this truck performs incredibly. I have a heavy foot and the 4.6L V8 suits my every need. I own a 21 foot boat and the towing abilities are great! Also, being in NC means I enjoy the Outer Banks where I regularly take to the sandy beaches and have NEVER gotten stuck. Even without the Explorer's AdvanceTrac traction control, the Mountaineer's full-time All Wheel Drive performs admirably in virtually any situation. I simply love this truck... 200000+ miles and no issues!!"

Things I love: comfort, turning radius, quality, sound system, ease of handling, reliability, ease of maintainence, and runs on regular grade fuel.  My former cars were a Mercedes and BMW, and this is more comfortable, reliable, and economical to maintain than either.  The paint doesn't chip or fade, and always looks great. 2 people have bumped into me and caused damage to their cars but no damage to mine.  It's great going up mountains such as the Sierras.  There are so many little well-thought out details.  I have no complaints."

Ours has been a solid, comfortable, trouble free vehicle.  Looks nice, too.  22-23 mpg highway; decent for a heavy vehicle.  Unfortunately I have had to have the rear bumper repainted twice; once was my fault (garage incident) and another parking lot incident.  Goes like a tank in the snow (AWD).  The downside to having such a nice SUV is that you can't really do the ""utility"" thing like you mean it.  But at least it has more cajones than a minivan."

Love the commanding view of the road, versatility of passengers & cargo, use it to haul my DJ equipment, it all fits!!!  Handles much better than a ""truck"", rides firm but comfortable, handles well foe such a high center of gravity.  Note: I finally replaced the OEM Goodyear Eagle LS with some Bridgestone Dueler Alenza H/L tires, the vehicle has been transformed.  It now rides & handles almost on par with my 2003 Sable.  Steering feel & response is now superb!!!  Did have some recalls, on the rear glass hardware & the rear axle, starter, battery, rear shocks replaced."

Took to dealer and they couldn't find a problem, and couldn't help because the check engine light didn't come on. So I visited many other sites and found that others had the same issue.

Fuel economy is great for the class of SUV it is in. I routinely get 19-21 MPG highway.  My only gripe at all was with the design of the rear storage compartment.  It should be able to go flat and not be on a slant.    Aside from that minor beef it has given me 36K miles of outstanding service.  "

The fuel economy is awful though, (only about 13-15 combined). Overall I have been pleased with this truck. The only complaint I have is that the interior quality could be better. The truck has 110,000 miles and does tend to have some minor rattles, but not too bad, other cars I have had don't generally start to rattle until much later, but hey It's a Ford not a Mercedes!"

This vehicle is up to the task.  Disappointed in the road noise and just average seat comfort.  Had significant electrical problems fixed under warranty.  Still, I know when the snow is flying and the kids are in the vehicle we'll get where we're going and back again."
mercury,mountaineer,2003,judy, 07/21/2006,Never wanted an SUV,4,"My husband kept insisting I needed a 4WD vehicle.  I buy a vehicle because of the way it looks, no other reason.  The salesman showed me 5 vehicles the day I bought the Mountaineer.  Each one had to be cleaned of 6 inches of snow! When I saw the Mountaineer, I said ""ok I like how this looks.  I drove it, and bought it that day.  It's been 1 1/2 years and I love it.  "
mercury,mountaineer,2003,suzie, 09/01/2008,Great SUV except,4,"I loved this SUV, of course gas mileage stinks, but for an AWD it rides like a luxury car. Heated seats, 3rd row seating, great. Cons...wheel bearings. They all go too early, AC wires rusted out. I also knew 3 people who had the same problems, bearings and AC rusting out. Mercury knew this but never recalled the vehicles. Tires, I went through two pairs in three years. Other than that, a fine vehicle."

it to the explorer, I had an explorer 
before my Mountaineer and the 
Mountaineer hands on is ten time better 
than the explorer and well worth the 
extra money"
mercury,mountaineer,2003,LINDSAY-ROSES DAD, 08/22/2003,WE FINALLY PICKED A WINNER,4,"WE ORIGINALLY PICKED A NISSAN 
QUEST WHICH WAS NICE BUT IT SPENT MORE 
TIME IN THE SHOP THAN IN OUR DRIVE WAY. 
THE MOUNTAINEER WAS OUR NEXT CHOICE AND 
WE HIT THE JACKPOT. WE LOVE THE WAY IT 
RIDES AT ALL SPEEDS. THE OPTIONS ARE 
SUPERB. WE WISHED WE COULD HAVE GOTTEN 
2-TONED PAINT WITH THE PREMIER PACKAGE, 
NOT A BIG SACRIFICE. 78MPH GOT US 17.5 
MPG, NOY BAD WITH THE V-8 AWD MODEL. WE 
TRIED THE 6 CYLINDER AND DROVE IT 200 
FEET AND RETURNED IT, THE V-8 IS A 
MUST!!. WITH A TON OF MONEY BACK FROM 
THE FACTORY AND A GREAT DEAL FROM THE 
DEALERSHIP, WE GRABBED A 38900 FOR 
30500. WE OWN A USED CAR LOT AND IT IS 
A ""SIN"" TO BUY NEW, NOT ANY MORE!!"
mercury,mountaineer,2003,Okie7597, 09/01/2003,What a Great Buy!!,5,"I looked at many of the midsize SUVs, 
and the MM won hands-down.  Styling, 
build quality and performance were all 
as good or better as anything else in 
its class.  The fact that I got mine 
for $24k brand new didn't hurt either.  
Fuel economy is not nearly as bad as I 
had expected; I'm getting 19mpg in 
combined city/highway driving."
mercury,mountaineer,2003,axeman, 09/06/2003,"Surprised, really won me",4,"Very simply, when my wife said she had 
been car shopping and selected the 
Mountaineer, I thought she was joking. 
She wasn't and this vehicle has 
performed wonderfully.  We like the 
style design and comfort. Of the many 
different brands test driven, this has 
the best and most quiet ride of those 
in its class."
mercury,mountaineer,2003,TCS7777, 09/06/2003,"Best, safest, ride ever!",4,"The coupling of a V-8 with a great 
shifting automatic, equates to sheer 
power! Besides the Performance, there 
is safety, that goes way beyond dual 
air bags. With Side curtin protection 
and great view of the road, I feel 
safer in this vehicle than any I have 
ever owned! I would put this 
Mountaineer against any vehicle on the 
road today!"

of my old Acuras that I enjoyed so 
much in terms of firmness in the 
interior. We took the 0% financing 
since we will keep for 6-10 years.The 
4.6 is a VERY powerful engine. Fun to 
drive and the 3 kids love it too. They 
like it better than our 2001 Yukon XL."
mercury,mountaineer,2003,Joehlers, 11/26/2003,So far so good,4,"My last two cars were a Mercedez Benz 
E320 and an Audi A6, so obviously there 
is no comparison with the ride.  
However, I really like driving up 
higher, and the vehicle gives me a 
safer comfort level.  This is a classy 
SUV at a reasonable price.  And, I'm 
sure I will appreciate the AWD in the 
winter."
mercury,mountaineer,2003,Wayne Greene, 08/30/2005,Great SUV,4,"This is a superb SUV. Very comfortable and easy to drive. It handles as well as a sedan which is supprising. The ride is like your typical modern day SUV. I had to settle for the Luxury model because of the lack of head room in the Premier with the Sunroof. I am 6'1"". We have the V6 with a class III/IV tow package that pulls our 3500 lb boat better than our V8 truck. This Mountaineer is my wife's primary use vehicle but is also the vehicle we get in when traveling together."
mercury,mountaineer,2003,Mr. Q Inc., 01/20/2004,Best Value on the Market,4,"I originally considered the Aviator, 
Envoy XL, and Sequoia.  After driving 
the  Mountaineer, I could not figure 
why I should pay at least $5,000 more 
for the others.  Outstanding handling 
and the V8 engine had more than enough 
power.  So comfortable I look forward 
to coming back to it.  I don't notice 
road bumps that I use to, but yet very 
sturdy when it hits a big bump.  Was 
more quiet than the Aviator, more 
powerful than both the Envoy & 
Sequoia, as comfortable as the Envoy, 
and way less expensive than all the 
above.  I drive 120 miles/ day, and 
enjoy every one of them in this 
vehicle.  The children love the room 
in the back as well."

the '03.  A mth after purchase, I heard 
humming from the rear.  took it back to 
John Eagle. informed by serv mgr that 
there existed a known defect w/ rear 
axle.  Ford had to replace the entire 
rear end of my SUV. 
In April 04, my wife was driving the 
car in the HOV lane when the rear axel 
locked up.  The vehicle began to skid 
and black smoke was coming out of the 
vehicle.  Thru the grace of God my wife 
maneuvered the vehicle without having a 
rear-end collision.  In the vehicle w/ 
my wife was my two boys (3 and 1 mth)

warranty and provided loaner 
vehicle.    Compared with Explorer with 
similar options Mountaineer is a better 
deal.  Paid $500 over invoice.  (Thanks 
Edmunds!)  Also looked at Acura MDX and 
Volvo XC90.  Both were more expensive 
and not as flexible with the seating 
space.  "
mercury,mountaineer,2003,Holli, 10/05/2005,Love my Mountaineer,4,"I've had my mountaineer for 2 1/2 years and have not had any problems.  I just took it in for a recall.  Some bolts needed replaced on the rear glass.  I think I have every option available there is to get, so it makes other vehicles seem like they're missing something. We have a V8 and it has the best pickup I've ever driven.  Great in the snow.  I live in Indiana, so we get plenty of it and ice.  The only things I would like to see different are in the 2005 model, such as reclining seats for the 2nd row.  It would also be nice if the seats were softer and there was a high/low switch for the heated seats.  I don't plan on getting rid of this SUV."
mercury,mountaineer,2003,John Riley, 12/08/2006,2003 Mountaineer,4,"Putting an average of 21K miles per year requires a reliable vehicle. So far, we have only replaced tires with 70K miles and no major or minor issues. Gas mileage is poor. Even though this vehicle has a 6 cyl, acceleration is good. Like the looks and overall performance. Short turning radius is one of the more impressive features."

The dual a/c, rear a/c, audio system, turning radius, and comfort seating is just great.  Gas mileage and the 3rd row seating not laying flat are the only complaints I have.  It is my first SUV and I couldn't be happier.   "
mercury,mountaineer,2003,Danpemby, 09/29/2007,Nice Ride,4,Bought this car against my better judgment. The wife really wanted it so we got it. I was surprised by the performance and comfort of this vehicle. We drive it on winy back roads and it handles like a true champ. I recommend it to all.

But two transmissions in 2 years at $1500 dollars and wheel bearings in less than a year was a little too much. The air conditioner shows no results on leakage testing, but it was filled 2 times a year, it would be freezing then high points on vents would be cold and lower vent warm. Ford could not find what the  problem was, but suggested another Mountianeer because this was a used purchase. Another problem was the transmission stick is located on the bottom and will require a special instrument to check fluid level. bad idea. "

day after buying because the A/C 
didn't turn on.  The Auto repair shop

American cars but, we love our 2003 
Mountaineer.  It's only three weeks 
old which probably isn't a true 
assesment period but we love the

hearing a noise like a clutch fan or 
the transmission slipping.  Have since 
had it to the dealer 2x and they say 
they can do nothing.  They say it has 
to do with the powertrain control 
module software and that ""they"" are 
working on a fix.  Not exactly the 
answer I wanted to hear, especially 
considering you can actually feel the 
transmission slip at times.  The 
vehicle now has 6347.0 miles.  
  Also, the vehicle only gets 12 miles

disappointed me."

how I would like a ""truck.""  But I have 
been pleasantly surprised.  Very 
comfortable, handles extremely well.  
It is definitely affected much more by 
the wind, in both handling and noise.  
I ordered a cargo area shade, and am 
much happier to have a ""trunk"" area for

a bigger gas tank."
mercury,mountaineer,2003,kate lab, 01/08/2003,Cool SUV,4,"In leather trim this SUV seems better

6 cylinder seems more than adequate if 
you are not towing (I can not comment 
positive or negative on towing).  All 
in all I am very satisfied with 
quality, handling, performance, etc so 
far.  

Personally, I think it is a better buy

Mountaineer gives a smooth ride (for an

Great in deep snow. Interior is very
comfortable and roomy. MPG could be
improved with a more modern engine
design, but the tradeoff is that this
uses     low grade (not super) fuel, so
the cost per mile isn't that staggering."

superior handling capabilities and the 
same 3rd row flexibility. 

Interior materials are nice compared

mercury,mountaineer,2003,emon07, 05/21/2003,Buyer Beware!!!,4,"I did not like the third row seat.  I 
drove the car for about 1 1/2 weeks and 
the ABS light would stay on.  After 
three days I was able to pickup my 
vehicle and the following morning the 
ABS light came on again.  I returned 
the vehicle for service the following 
Monday.  I waited one week and three 
days for the repair to be completed.  
The vehicle message center it shows 
that I am getting 9mpg on the highway 
and 8mpg on the street - this is 
crazy.  I called the dealership and was 
made to wait two weeks before I could 
bring the vehicle in for repair.  "
mercury,mountaineer,2003,Roosterman, 05/24/2003,Nearing End of 1st Year,3,"Overall, I like the Mountaineer better 
than its cousin the Explorer.  It's a 
shame, though, that Ford's cost 
accountants seem to be ""driving"" the 
quality of Ford's products down because 
of cheap materials.  This is a well-
designed vehicle that could be alot 
better if the quality was higher.  I 
don't think Ford is capable any longer 
of delivering a vehicle anywhere close 
to the quality of the Toyotas and 
Hondas.  I checked the resale value on 
this vehicle recently and was amazed at 
how it had plunged, far greater than 
normal first year depreciation which, 
for most American vehicles, is pretty 
lousy anyway.  "

hearing a noise like a clutch fan or 
the transmission slipping.  Have since 
had it to the dealer 2x and they say 
they can do nothing.  They say it has 
to do with the powertrain control 
module software and that ""they"" are 
working on a fix.  Not exactly the 
answer I wanted to hear, especially 
considering you can actually feel the 
transmission slip at times.  The 
vehicle now has 6347.0 miles.  
  Also, the vehicle only gets 12 miles 
per gallon, which very much 
disappointed me.  "

experience at the dealer."
mercury,mountaineer,2004,Elaine Stone, 04/08/2016,Most reliable car I've ever owned.,5,"I purchased my 2004 Mountaineer used in 2008.  I paid way below book value, due mainly to the fact that it's somewhat of a gas hog and everyone was shopping for fuel efficiency at the time.  It now has 190,000 miles on it.  Just had new tires put on, new wheel bearings, and replaced a worn control arm.  I have had zero mechanical or electronic issues. We did replace the back hatch panel at about 100,000 miles which I hear is common for those to crack.  One hinge on the back glass hatch was replaced at the same time.   I hit a 10 point buck in January of this year that garnered me a new hood, driver side headlight and fender, grill and front bumper.  The Mountaineer took the hit, and I was able to drive it home!  There was still way more value in the car than the repairs cost.  I have the 3rd row seats and there is a ton of room for hauling kids, adults, and cargo when all of the back seats are folded down.  The leather interior has held up well; driver's seat is starting to crack a little.  The exterior is still nice except for a rust bubble forming over the passenger back tire and some rust on the interior back doors(?). The electronic ""perks"" are limited due to technology not being available at the time of production, but what's on it still works.  I love this car and dread the day that I have to trade.  I'm sad that there are no more being produced, but since the Ford Explorer is virtually the same vehicle, I'll probably go to that when I turn this car over to my teenage son.

It drives smooth and quite, but recently my car hesitates at stop signs and when shifting gears, so we know what that meant.  I was hoping it would fix itself, but no.  It started to make a loud vibrated jerking thud when shifting gears.  I have 56k miles on it.  In a matter of three days it became an inconveince to I won't drive and took it to the dealer I bought it from.  The o/d light came on and was blinking.  Not sure yet what the problem is but it is transmission related, whether electrical or hydrolic.  I love the ride but I don't think I risk buying another Mercury:("

Apparently if your tires are the same size but have diff amount of tire life left to them it can total out your entire car. I got two new tires put on and because the circumfrance was different between the to sets it caused my rear differential and transfer case to go out. The estimated repairs from the Ford dealership is at 10k! My car is only worth 9k with 63,000 miles on it and its fully loaded. This has been a total nightmare. do not purchase a Mountaineer. "

Yet after reading all these reviews, I can't afford to keep this thing without a government bailout.  I'm going to take a loss and by me a Honda."

have had a transmission problem, 
starting at 15,000 miles.  Some other 
minor problems.  I was in an Acura 
3.5RL before and loved that car.  It 
too was not perfect.  I needed an SUV 
and thought this was a good priced 
purchase.  I looked at many SUVs and 
decided on the Mountaineer.  I have the 
AWD Premier V8.  Tons of power and 
rides nice.  We had a Navigator before 
and it rides better than the '98 
Navigator.  For the options this truck 
came with it was a good buy.  I do not 
know if I would buy another one because 
of the transmission issue.  After

guess mine is not a normal Mountaineer."

I forgot about the time the battery ran completely dead and disarmed my keys so I couldn't start the car afterwards.  Had to have the car towed to a Mercury dealership 28 miles away and get new keys programmed for the car.  About a 400 dollar mistake altogether.  Are you kidding me?  Need I say more?"

We have only done standard maintenance repairs on it- oil changes at 4000 miles, brakes, and one alternator. Other than that it has always kept us safe, kept driving us home and I never worried on long trips about it. I knew it would keep us all safe. We have driven to Florida, Niagara Falls, Ely, MN, SC and many other trips. It has held many strollers and car seats with plenty of room. I love the back window hatch open you cant find that any more. They all have the whole door that opens now. Now that it is so old the problems we have had are the hydraulics on the hatch and back door stick. the AWD have locked a little now and the drive train is going.

seat where it can't be seen or easily 
found by touch. My daily commute has 
been very enjoyable. The V6 provides 
adequate power. Merging and passing on 
the highway are no problem.  Fuel 
economy has been better than expected

at several other SUV's, but they were 
either too expensive, not roomy 
enough, or just plain over rated.  We 
really like the Mountaineer.  It has 
tons of room, and the ride is fine 
(for an SUV). Took a 9 hour trip 
recently without a backache.  Mileage 
is average for a vehicle this size. 
Like all the bells and whistles, and

Each has been better than the last, although the 94 is still running, and we sold it with 140,000 miles on it.  Same transmission, engine, A/C still worked.  4WD had quit at about 110,000, and I never fixed it. The independent rear suspension offered since 02 is class leading, and only now are some of the other manufactures offering it.  It improves handling dramatically, and allows for the 3rd seat to actually be functional and comfortable for an adult. The rear air, coming through the ceiling is extraordinary as well.

This is a beautiful SUV for sure, was a little put off by the low resale value, but look at it this way, I didn't want a car payment, and to buy a Tahoe with twice the mileage it would have cost the same. Everything works great so far, and I can say this, having owned two S-10 Blazers, a Dodge Grand Caravan, and a Ford Windstar, the Ford products have been better rides, the electrical has certainly held up better, and the cars have seemed all-around sturdier."

great price and a quality vehicle."

The third row seat was one of the reasons we 
wanted to trade, and being standard was a 
plus for me. The in-dash CD changer is nice, 
frees up a ton of space in the console. I also 
like the independant rear suspension. The ride 
of the new Mountaineer is much smoother

once you take into consideration that 
the Mountaineer comes with the 3rd row

It also looks good when pulling up at 
a function.  The gas mileage kind of 
stinks, but average for an SUV this

sister the Explorer.  In fact, it's 
like getting a Lincoln ride for a Ford

love it. First of all it has a lot of 
room, it's big but not huge. It is 
pretty easy backing into parking 
spaces. The turning radius is great. 
Another feature that make it worth the 
money is the all wheel drive. The only 
bad thing is that I noticed it uses 
more gas then my other 4 x 4's did. So

everywhere!  Hauls everything, and 
looks good doing it.  Easy to see out

Only issue so far is once in a while 
when I start the car and don't let it 
warm up (even on mild days) I threatens 
to stall when I stop at the bottom of 
the hill in my neighborhood.  It lunges 
forward and repeatedly reves until I

performance, styling and the overall 
utility.  The 4.6L aluminum V8 is much 
smoother than the 4.0L V6 and gas 
mileage is very similair.  Go with the 
V8 if you are thinking about towing or 
if you are concerned about resale 
value.  Nicer overall than 
many ""upscale"" imports we drove such 
as the Volvo XC90 (sluggish).  "

great for big families. Its not huge like an 
expedition but has lots of room for everyone 
and its real easy to park in tight spots. I would 
say that this medium sized SUV would be best 
out of any other competition except for the 
luxurious aviator. The interior materials are of 
a real nice quality and seats are confortable. 
Rides smooth  in highways and has nice 
suspension for the bumpy rides. The powerful 
V8 engine is awesome and makes the car real 
fun to drive! This SUV also has lots of neat 
gadgets that would mostly be found on 
luxurious SUV's. "

the 3 Explorers we had during the 90s. 
The quality has been excellent! Almost 
went Toyota after all of our 99 
Explorer's problems. We now have about 
25000 miles on it and there has not 
been one defect. Easier to drive than  
old Explorers... a little
more ""squat"". Less bounce and 
easier/lower entry for my wife 

Two complaints. Major: the so-called 
leather seats. The driver's seat is 
clearly beat up at 25K mi and will 
certainly reqire sheepskin covers at 
50-75K. Minor:the rear window should 
have a more solid closing mechanism. 
But other than that, it's been great."

the V8 (robust and very smooth).  A 
little loud on accleration, but hey, 
it's an SUV.  This vehicle has plenty

that not only does it allow you to

it ride just like a car. Starting off 
with small car, and moving to a 
mountainneris a step thatI would get to 
at some point in my life and I did. I 
would always have a mountainner, a car 
that I love, and have the feeling of 
being safe and looking good in it is 
something sacred. For the first time

experienced a ride in the far back seat

The only problem that I've experienced 
is that the car wants to stall out in 
either cold or warm weather. The engine 
begins to rev up, the car lunges 
forward repeatedly,then proceeds to 
stall when I decelerate upon 
approaching a stop sign/light or into a 
turn. Eventually I have to put the car 
into park and give it a little gas to 
stop the revving. It's an intermmitent 
problem occuring a few times a month.
I have had it looked at twice and they 
can't seem to find the problem.  Today 
it is in the shop for an oil change, 
hopefully they can correct the problem.

The '03 and the '05 have better stability and cornering than the '99.  I also like the extra  room in the cabin.

When compared to other SUVs its handling characteristics are excellent. 
mercury,mountaineer,2005,pop123, 04/28/2005,Best one yet!,4,"this 2005 Mercury Mountaineer Premier is the best vehicle i had yet. Love the color ""Silver Birch"" in PREMIER, love the V8, Premier touches, Factory Remote Starter, everything else."
mercury,mountaineer,2005,mike, 07/01/2005,awesome value,4,"this vehicle has awd capability, 7 passenger seating, exceptional performance, great exterior and functional interior styling and a plethora of standard features at an incredible price. cross-shopped vs. durango, envoy and pilot and they priced out to be in a range of 2500 to 4000 more, comparably equipped."
mercury,mountaineer,2005,C, 07/21/2005,cold feet,4,the only bad feature that I have found is that the air conditioning vents on the front floor do not turn off even though the controls indicate that they do.  I asked the dealer about this and they told me that they contacted Ford and that this is normal.  That there is no way to turn off the air comming out of the bottom vents.  This is a problem for women that are wearing shorts with sandles on.  It is to cold on their feet.
mercury,mountaineer,2005,Bill, 12/05/2005,Great Vehicle,4,"Good handling, brakes, styling, driving position, ride comfort and room make this a good choice.  Gas mileage is bad, but that is to be expected in a vehicle this size.  Fit and finish are excellent and the quality of materials is a step above the Explorer and miles ahead of the domestic competition. "
mercury,mountaineer,2005,S.K.LAHIRI, 12/19/2005,Solidly built with roomy interior,3,"I have recently purchased 2005 (Dec, 05) Mountaineer at Dubai (M/East) with possible all options like leather interior, rev. parking sensor, alloy wheel, 6 CD changer, 8"" DVD etc. except moonroof. It gives me 14- 15L/100KM av which includes highway and city driving. Although it has a sluggish response for acceleration, overall safe and roomy feeling with all around clear view makes it a pleasure for driving.   While shifting is slightly noticeable while AC is on, otherwise it is totally silky smooth. Its AC is powerful and responsive.  I only regret that it does not have Xenon headlamps and nor as an option. Same goes for a retractable antenna.  It is a commendable car"
mercury,mountaineer,2005,Denise, 07/23/2016,Best SUV I've ever owned!,5,"I purchased my mountaineer 3 years ago used with 110000 miles on it. I'm at 177000 miles now and the only thing I've had to replace was the normal wear and tare or the brakes, I've replaced the altenator with a life time one. I love this truck because it has heated seats, a 6 disc changer, a DVD player for my grand babies with the head phones, 3rd row seating & the sensor that lets me know not to back into anything. Also it's pulled me out of mountains of snow in the winter time! To get good gas Milage  I use the mid grade.
"
mercury,mountaineer,2005,nvs, 07/14/2008,"OK, could be better",4,"Overall it's been OK but the build quality could be better and only has 42k. So far we have had to replace the tires 3 times cant buy just one its AWD. Wheels are going bad from rust/corrosion and the chrome is peeling. Been in shop two times in 6 months for wheel bearings. CD changer ate the disks and they wont come out. Dont get me wrong, I like it. The power is great. With the 5 speed and the V8 on the freeway it gets 20 mpg or more but around town its like 15 or less.  "
mercury,mountaineer,2005,Joe, 04/21/2005,Love My Mountaineer,4,"This is my second Mountaineer, I just traded in my 2000.  The Convenience package with the special edition 17"" Chrome rims is a real head turner.  The V8 really has some kick to it, great off the line power and smooth overall output.  For the price, this is an awesome SUV."
mercury,mountaineer,2005,Jeanne Ambrogio, 07/26/2005,Lovin It,4,"I have a 2002 with 82,000 miles and except for the normal oil changes and tune up it has NEVER given me a problem. I love it and Ford Credit has been very supportive through my bad times"
mercury,mountaineer,2005,Chip, 01/12/2006,Ft. Myers,1,"It has been at the dealer 3 times for warranty work.  The rearend went out at 12K miles.  When you turn the steering wheel it makes a grinding noise, which the dealer says nothing is wrong.  They can't fix it.  I have owned Ford truck/SUV's for the past 10 years and never had any problems.  My wife has had only Honda/Toyota products.  I am going to sell it and put her back into either a Honda/Toyota product."
mercury,mountaineer,2005,pop123, 01/31/2005,Nice truck!,4," I love my mountaineer if you decide to purchase one always get the premier model its well worth it! V8 engine and security group, leather! The only thing is the gas milage on the V8 but the V6 doesnt have enough power after leasing a 2002 model."
mercury,mountaineer,2005,Richard Barone, 06/02/2005,marvelous machine,4,"I was concerned abou the upgrade from the 1997 Mountaineer to the 2004 version as the size was larger and my initial reaction was that it was a moving living room. Quickly i realized the comfort, safety ease of handling and feel in love with this marvelous machine"
mercury,mountaineer,2005,Dai Nguyen, 06/11/2005,I wish I bought a Toyota instead,1,"I've owned several import cars in the past (Honda and Toyota) and a friend talked me into this ""mistake"". needless to say we're no longer friends anymore. This has been the single worst automobile I have ever owned! I have owned it for 3 months now and only been able for drive it for approximatly 3 1? 2 weeks. My fuel pump has gone out, the power window motors on both front door have been replaced, AND the transmission has blown up. Never..NEVER will I buy another domestic car as long as I live!"
mercury,mountaineer,2005,christina, 07/27/2005,Love IT!,4,"Never a problem.  Very spacoius 3rd row seat. Very easy to use. Great for trooping kids around. Love the interior.  Great stereo system. Love the design.  Also handles very well  on the highway when its windy, unlike another SUV I previously owned."
mercury,mountaineer,2005,lduke32, 10/15/2004,Nice Styling and Quality,4,"The Mountaineer looks like no other 
SUV. It's interior is richly appointed 
for the price. The ride could be 
smoother and the 4.0 liter smoother 
but overall it is a solidly made 
vehicle. I recommend the Mercury 
Mountaineer"

quality of ride and workmanship.  I 
wish gas mileage would improve, but I 
am willing to live with it.    "
mercury,mountaineer,2005,Deeanna, 11/18/2004,Great SUV,4,"This SUV is wonderful on trips. Took a 
trip south and averaged 23.5 MPG 
highway. In town driving I get 18-19 MPG
I have owned several SUV's, 1 Chevrolet 
Blazer and 2 Ford Explorers...this 
Mountaineer will dance circles around 
anyone of them. I am very satisfied 
with the performace and comfort of this 
SUV."
mercury,mountaineer,2005,Bentley, 11/12/2004,Fun on the road,4,"We just traded in a Mercury Grand 
Marquis in April, 2004. I like the 
Mountainer for the reliability and the 
safety. I like sitting up higher when 
driving than you would if driving a car.
One feature I feel they could improve 
on would be the locations of the 
switches for adjustments of front 
seats. Why not put them on doors like 
the Marquis do? Plus there could be 
more head room in the front seat area. 
I have noticed taller people close to 
top interior. 
Overall I have enjoyed the Mountaineer 
and it is likely we will keep this one 
for a few years."
mercury,mountaineer,2005,Jerome Rich, 12/07/2004,Under rated 7-passenger SUV,4,"A trouble-free SUV that does everything 
well. My only complaint are the cheap 
leather seats."
mercury,mountaineer,2005,Paul P, 12/20/2004,contender for mid-size SUV's,4,"This is a great vehicle for practical 
SUV usage. I am however disappointed 
that it has the lowest horsepower in 
its class. Standing at only 210??? GMC 
envoy has 270;priced evenly. I am 
pleased with the overall performance of 
the vehicle, however unimpressed with 
the gas mileage, averaging only 12.1 on 
the streets and 16.6 on the highway. 
Being a car connessieur, I would 
recommend this vehicle for family use, 
however if you're looking for power this 
is not the SUV to buy. Head over to GMC 
or Dodge if you are in the American 
market."

mercury,mountaineer,2005,Lynn V. Holaday, 01/06/2005,Happy Driver,4,"We love our new Mountaineer--mainly for 
its comfort and performance.  It drives 
better than any of our earlier SUVs and 
feel's quite classy.  Unfortunately it 
gets pretty awful gas mileage, but I 
guess that's the tradeoff with a SUV.  
Two thumbs up."
mercury,mountaineer,2005,pop123, 01/20/2005,Excellent Mountaineer! Best One YET!,5,"Yes this mountaineer is the best one yet out of the 4 i have leased already!  Out of all my mountaineers there hasent been any problems whatsoever!  if decide to get one get the ""PREMIER MODEL"" it's well worth it!"
mercury,mountaineer,2005,big_scooter, 02/05/2005,This is my fifth Ford vehicle.,4,"The Mountaineer has more style than the Explorer, which is one of the reasons I chose this vehicle. It has plenty of power with the V8 and it is effortless to drive. It is very comfortable and roomy for a mid sized SUV. Gas mileage could be better, but the  performance is worth it. "
mercury,mountaineer,2005,frb, 03/05/2005,Perfect,4,I really enjoy my suv.Its roomy very comfortable and smooth ride.When going up long mountains I turn overdrive off and the power and speed is amazing. Its a sharp lookin vehicle also.Classy and rugged at same time. Big and strong feeling but still feels like a suv not a truck. Perfect!!!!!!!!!!!
mercury,mountaineer,2005,Russ, 07/19/2005,My 2nd Mountaineer,4,"This Mountaineer is a small step down from the Luxury version that was my 2002 Mountaineer.  I have been very pleased with my last one and this one has some trade off I can live with.  I went to the Dealer looking to get a Mountaineer or an Explorer.  Why would ANYONE buy an Explorer in which Leather seats and the 3rd row seat is an up charge??? Comparable Explorer with Leather and NO 3rd row seat is the same price.  Better ride and styling that Explorer.  I put 109,000 + on my 2002 with NO mechanical problems.  Been through 2 accidents and still going strong at trade in.  I look to continue the same with 2005."
mercury,mountaineer,2005,Geof, 02/13/2005,Too Much Gas,4,"Only concern is the poor gas mileage around town. During cold Minnesota winter a little over 10mpg is all we can get out of it. Compared to a colleagues V-8 Toyota we are unimpressed. While the official figures are under ideal conditions, this is the farthest off we have ever seen from a vehicle. Thankfully we use it only about 8,000 miles a year.  Full marks for the dealership who were great with purchase and after sales service. "
mercury,mountaineer,2005,JackMaddy, 03/19/2005,Got for a good price. So far so good!,4,Picked a Red Convenience up with all the bells and wistles.  There are a few feature missing like rear motion detector and heated seats and DVD..but for the 24K i picked this AWD up for we love it.  The 3rd row is not very practical..but we kinda knew that..it more of a nice option just incase you need to seat more people.  Once in the 3rd row...its not too bad even for adults.it just getting back there that is the issue.  However I think this is the case with most mid-sized SUV's.  The mileage is not great..but c'mon its an SUV what do you expect ;)  I really love this car and glad we went with this instead of a Lame Toyota Sienna.  Highly recommended..8.8 outta 10.
mercury,mountaineer,2005,Jerry Riley, 03/24/2005,Never Want to Drive a CAR,4,"I Love this truck.  We go the DVD package and our little girl will ride forever without interruption I believe that is a selling point in its own, all the kids want to ride with us because of the TV and headphones, you can still listen to your channel and they can still watch TV without interruption.  But the truck itself is AWESOME I will never own another CAR at all.  The gas prices may stink now but they will go down and I will still have my GREAT truck"
mercury,mountaineer,2005,Toyota is bettter, 03/21/2005,Terrible buy!!!,3,"I bought this car exactly 1 year and 2 months ago.  It is a piece of junk.  It rides well but it doesn't ride as well as GMC or the Japanese companies.  This car has okay pickup and terrible gas milliage.  The quallity of this car is cheap since it is a Ford product.  Next time, I will either buy the Chevy Tahoe, Infiniti FX45, or the Toyota Highlander, or the Honda Pilot or CRV.  They all ride better and are nicer.  I was taken and I bought an suv with a terrible value. "
mercury,mountaineer,2005,nancy, 04/04/2016,worst car for crashes,1,"this was the worst car regarding a crash. my husband was driving 20 miles pr hour, hit a car in the rear. the car he hit was a 2002 Toyota who hit a 2006 Volkswagen. My car was totaled. The whole front end buckled up like a accordion. The worse issue was the air bags came out and they where deflated. They never blew up, we had a passenger in the car thank God no one was injured. The other two cars drove off. This car has electrical issues with the windows right passenger door window electrical. Otherwise I loved this car. Gas was bad also. Car holds great value.

mercury,mountaineer,2006,Al Anderson, 10/06/2015,Great Alternative to a Pickup for Family Men,5,"I really, really, wanted a pickup truck but was convinced by a mentor to buy a good SUV and a trailer given the other things I needed to do with my vehicle. I found my mountaineer for a steal of a price and haven't regretted it one iota. It's been a champ through and through. The gas mileage is what one would expect, but it more than makes up for it in the lack of repairs. The one thing I was warned is that it will chew up tires, but I bought a good quality set some years ago and have them rotated with each oil change. They've lasted just fine. The interior is roomy and altogether very manipulable- seats fold up for hauling kiddos and fold down very well for hauling cargo or sleeping in the back on a long road trip. It tows my small to medium loads very well and offroads without hesitation. The tech is outdated but reliable and user friendly. Aside from the usual routine maintenance have not had one breakdown yet in 10 years. I think my favorite is its incredibly tight turn radius. I can maneuver this thing as tightly as any car I've driven, perhaps moreso. It puts our minivan to shame on this front. All around a great vehicle.

Unfortunatly the 06 has had trany problems from day one. 30,000 miles on it as of today and the trany probley remains. Hard down shifts 2/1, almost like being rearended every time. Dealor and factory rep say this is normal. I find it totally unacceptable. Must be in the design. Other than the trans probs,and the ridiculous design of the inside door handles, I could not be happier. "
mercury,mountaineer,2006,Donald Sistrunk, 11/29/2006,our first suv,4,"We have had many new trucks and cars, but this is our first suv. Very pleased with the smooth ride and good handling. Since I'm used to driving a big truck, the gas mileage id not bad. the few bad points I have against it are the small seats that bit too high. It feels like my head is always touching the ceiling. also the door handle is too low to be comfortable. overall I am still pleased with my purchase of a mountaineer."
mercury,mountaineer,2006,JS, 10/29/2009,TSB 08-24-4 fixed transmission bump,4,"Initially had bad shifting problem when coming to a stop and felt a horrendous bump from behind when it shifted from 2nd to 1st gear - as described from several other reviews.   Ford Has a TSB 08-24-4 for reprogramming the transmission that they performed for free at the dealer I purchased from.  Bought used with 56K with Ford Premium Care 48k mile warranty.  The funnest vehicle I have ever owned now that trans is smoothed out.  This is a issue that took Ford 2 years to get a final fix.  This covers 2006-2008 Mercury Mountaineers, Ford Explorers and Sport Tracs with the 4.6 V8 6R60 transmissions. TSB 08-24-4 is the updated fix for the transmission bump that occurs when stopping. Google it."
mercury,mountaineer,2006,Wolfmann, 09/16/2006,The 06 Mountaineer,4,"The vehicle I purchased lacked only one thing as far as my needs where concerned, daytime running lamps. Other than that the car is fun to drive, sure footed on wet pavement. Responsive 4.6L from the 4.0L in the '02 version. In upstate NY on RT 17 there's a hill 5 miles long and goes up about 2700 ft, no problem the '06 doesn't shift out of O/D to maintain 64 - 67 mph with cruise control on. I'm 6'-2"" and driver and shotgun are very comfortable, 2nd row probably ok for 5'-9""'s , 3rd row kids only. The rear area HVAC is great for cooling down the car and holding it cool on hot days. The 6cd w/satelite radio has great sound. It's a car you get into n' say this is the way they should have done it."
mercury,mountaineer,2006,Tushae Thomas, 08/31/2018,Okay the real deal!!!,4,"Okay this SUV is good all around, but when it come to repairs it costs money!!! Especially when replacing the transmission fluid! Why because it’s a sealed case meaning no dip stick, so take it in or get some fittings from lows home improvement and a hand pump from Walmart or harbor freight. Or the next big one is the torque converter solenoid! So yeah good vehicle but somewhat hard to work on yourself. Overall it’s a good SUV good on the highway but not running and gunning around town you will eat that tank up fast! It’s also good in the snow as well, you can drive without chains. You can switch it from AWD (all wheel drive) to 4X4. Just chains with the system in snow and take it easy! Oh yeah the motors for reclining rear seats are hard to find once they go out!
"
mercury,mountaineer,2006,michelle, 08/16/2008,Terrible SUV,2,"I bought an 06 Premier V8 new. What a waste of 30K. It is beautiful but has been nothing but trouble. THE TRANSMISSION SLIPS and has had to be serviced once a quarter since I bought it. Ford has tried several different ""computer calibrations"" to fix it to no avail. Also motor on 3rd row seat went out even though we leave it down 99% of the time. Also, only gets 14 mpg, 17 HWY AT BEST. Seats are uncomfortable over 100 mile trips. Door handles are ridiculous & doors must be slammed to shut. I can't believe I traded in my Lexus on this clunker. Do yourself a favor and do not buy this car."
mercury,mountaineer,2006,Mrs. C, 05/12/2009,Transmission Probs--Beware,3,"After having owned my 06 Mountaineer with all the extras for a year--this is what has happened.  Been in the shop three times now for the transmission slips--they keep changing the computer settings (so they say).  Had to have master cylinder replaced at 10,000 miles (Ford cannot answer why it went bad). Now the motor has gone on the running boards.  Yes, they are all warrantied problems--but a pain in the butt to get to the service center all the time."
mercury,mountaineer,2006,1st SUV, 02/28/2010,Excellent Vehicle - Very Happy!,4,"I purchased this 2006 vehicle about 1 month ago from a private party, with about 28k miles.  After reading all the reviews about poor transmissions, and all the problems people were having, I almost turned away a great SUV!  I have had NO problems whatsoever (knock on wood) so far.  Transmission is very smooth & very fun to drive.  Interior design is very nice and unique, but the exterior presents nothing truly exciting.  I have been getting about 385 miles per tank, roughly 20 gallons to fill up, at about $60 bucks a pop...but it's well worth it, and it's an SUV so that was expected!"
mercury,mountaineer,2006,Petnannyz, 04/10/2010,Love this SUV - Bad Gas Mileage!,4,"I bought this SUV used in Nov 2007 with about 18,000 miles for $17,900 and got an awesome prices.  It is fully loaded and has the extra two seats in the back too.  Have driven it now for 29 months through summer's & New England weather.  It does shift a little rough at times and has gotten stuck in Park but there was a recall for that so dealership will fix that for free.  Love the AWD and how you can lock in the 4WD - pretty easy to do once you figure out the buttons.  Love the extra two seats in the way back and they fold up & down so easy!  Love my heated seats too; wouldn't get one with out them.  Not too pleased with the speaker sound, sounds tinny to me.  But otherwise love this SUV.  "
mercury,mountaineer,2006,PlainJoe, 05/17/2010,Can't Complain...,4,"Got this used with 25000 miles, now has 55000 miles. At first, I expected trouble but the car gave me none. Has not been to the dealer. CANT COMPLAIN. Im really happy with the performance. Does really well in NJ snow."
mercury,mountaineer,2006,George Houchens, 03/11/2006,2006 Mountaineer Needs human engineering,4,"Great vehicle except for interior. Dash and doors need redesign with attention to human engineering and style. Door handles are very inconvenient (too low and far forward), Seat belt needs to be longer for easy hookup (I am a big guy), and heater controls need to be located higher above radio so I can use them without taking eyes off the road.  Center console shifter is ugly! Square seats look blocky, and interior metal trim looks cheap. Rear fold down seats leave too many holes for things to fall into when hauling cargo.  Vehicle interior is NOT an improvement over 2003 Mountaineer. My wife agrees. Otherwise, car has great ride, very quiet, handles well.  Outside styling great."
mercury,mountaineer,2006,russell, 06/18/2006,enjoyable ride,4,The ride is very comfortable. Steering is a dream to handle. All of the controls are placed for a safe drive without taking your eyes off the road.
mercury,mountaineer,2006,impressed, 11/03/2005,Pleasantly surprised,4,"Got my Mountaineer last weekend. Loved almost everything about it - the very quiet interior, the ride and handling, and the power. Had owned a 2003 Explorer and thought the redesigned rear suspension was going to spoil an already good thing. I was pleasantly surprised. My only complaint is the interior door pull handle. The location is very awkward and an afterthought."
mercury,mountaineer,2006,Very Pleased, 01/27/2006,What a vehicle,5,"This is an amazing vehicle. I've had my Mountaineer for about 3 months, and I'm always looking for a reason to take it out for a ride. If only gas price was a little cheaper. I feel in complete control when I'm in it. I have driven a lot of cars and trucks but I have never driven a vehicle that handles this good."
mercury,mountaineer,2006,GLS, 03/02/2006,"Great, functional SUV",4,"This is my 3rd Mountaineer (1997, 2004) and it keeps getting better.  New ride is much smoother and quieter.  New steering wheel design very comfortable. Turning radius seems better.  Glad the heated seat control was moved to the console.Great size for times when you need the extra seating. Like the split 3rd row seat. Overall good value compared to other SUV's on the market."
mercury,mountaineer,2006,CO Driver, 07/19/2006,Great SUV for a Ford Product,4,"The Mercury Mountaineer is an all around great SUV with a nice standard package as well as a great option list that will make the price shoot through the roof. The 4.0L V6 is a great motor offering 210 hp and 254 ft-lbs of torque at 5100 rpm and an average of 20 mpg.  Living in Colorado I can really test the performance of a motor! At an average altitude of 5,280 ft and many passes that climb well over 12,000 ft, the 4.0L V6 had power to spare.  The handling of the Mountaineer is better than other SUV's test driven. With the Stability Control system, it really helps the Mountaineer really stick to the road. With minimal body roll and tight steering, their really is no ""wishy washy"" feeling"
mercury,mountaineer,2006,Chris in FLL, 08/01/2006,Test Drive One and You'll Believe,5,"The Mountaineer is much roomier and proves a quieter and smoother ride than the MDX.  This vehicle has a strong structure and transmits NO noise, squeaks or rattles in the cabin.  The power retracting running boards and the power 3rd row seats are a hoot.  Having driven the Acura, the Mountaineer is clearly a much better deal and when fully equipped was still thousands less than the MDX after the rebates."
mercury,mountaineer,2006,haf61, 09/25/2006,06 merc mountaineer,4,"Bought my '06 mountaineer after driving most all competetors, including mercedes, acura, and saab, and land rover.  Mountaineer outperformed them all and had the largest cargo area, most comfort and inexpensive price."
mercury,mountaineer,2006,mfc7, 03/05/2012,Great SUV,5,"I was not sure about getting my Mountaineer las year with all the missinformation out there. I just wanted tp let everyone know, it is not true. My SUV even had a savage title and has been GREAT, it is an awsome vehicle and you won't believe how much space, comfort and how reliable it is in the weather conditions I live in. "
mercury,mountaineer,2006,MRS. A, 09/26/2009,luv it,4,"I bought this used. Had a moutaineer in 1999. Love this SUV. Navigation/radio went out but was replaced with warranty. I get 22mpg on highway,bad around town. Traded off because I wanted the 8cyl. was well worth it. Again could not be happier.  "
mercury,mountaineer,2006,Great Value, 01/10/2008,Great Value,4,"Shopped Honda Pilots, Toyota Highlanders, Toyota 4Runners, Ford Explorers, Subarus, and some of the smaller SUVs as well (Rav4/Mariner/Escape/CRV).  Finally came across the Mercury Mountaineer.  Really liked the exterior styling of the Mountaineer over the Explorer and it seemed to offer more standard features.  Compared to the Honda/Toyota counterparts, the Mountaineer offered far more for the money (about a $6k - 8k difference for the Honda/Toyota equivalent).  Really like the smaller SUVs but was able to pick up the larger Mountaineer for about $1k - 2k more.  Once again, a great overall value.  Gas mileage is on par for a SUV of this size."
mercury,mountaineer,2006,Deborah Heckenberger, 06/10/2010,Love my Mountaineer,4,"This is my second Mountaineer (1st was 2003). I love the comfort, handling and roominess. I like the AWD, and my favorite feature is the heated seats, not too hot, not too cold. Only problem was shifting and the recall took care of that. Sorry that they are discontinuing or I would buy a third one in a year or so."
mercury,mountaineer,2006,KC, 03/28/2007,What a shame,3,"Great for all the reasons you read in the other reviews.  But watch that hard shift b/w 1&2 gear.  Ours (14 months old, 13,000 miles) is now in the shop for the third attempt to repair this.  Two torque converters and two transmission rebuilds later, we hope it is fixed for good.  Ford, in their infinite wisdom, would not authorize a replacement transmission.  So the mechanics keep rebuilding and replacing torque converters. Do not ignore the hard shifting b/w first and second gear if you have it in yours.  Otherwise we love the truck in all respects (except for the lack of door handles).  When it ran it ran great. What a shame. "
mercury,mountaineer,2006,John, 05/13/2007,Disappointment,2,"I have owned a 1995 Explorer and a 2000 Mountaineer. The 2006 is not an improvement but a huge disappointment. The ride is not good, very stiff! Even my 8 year old says his rear hurts after only 15 minutes. The transmission shifts hard and you feel it. There is very noticable jerky feel to the ride when at a steady mph. The 3rd row seats have a hole in them from the metal brackets when the seat is folded. Rear visiblity is very poor due to the headrest not going all the way down to the seat on the 2nd and 3rd row. I wish I kept my 2000 Mountaineer!"
mercury,mountaineer,2006,Shari, 04/17/2008,Very Nice,4,"Love the car--bought it brand new in 2007 with only 200 miles on it. Ride is great, kids love the extras. Retractable step bars are great in winter--they don't collect snow."
mercury,mountaineer,2006,Chase Stratus, 05/25/2017,Amazing SUV to own,5,"I have purchased my 06 mountaineer luxury package with 173k and its been 3 months now and so far my driving experience with this vehicle has been nothing but smooth and comfortable.  Yes i have had a few things done to make necessary repairs to drive shaft and a set of tires, but besides that the repair bill was not that high.  i have gone Thousands of miles so far and has never broken down on me or my family.  Kids love the rear seats, but will not recommend an adult sitting back there.  it can be done but the head room will not be sufficient for someone over 5 ft tall.  Starts every time, attractive and my favorite is that its really smooth driving.  surprisingly, not much road noise, but you do hear some.

mercury,mountaineer,2006,larry hancock, 04/30/2009,transmission woes,3,"I loved the car at first, smooth ride, nice looks and then about 30 days into the affair her true nature appeared. It started with downshifts, then went to pausing between shifts as the motor raced. The downshifting problem continued after to trips to the dealer, and now I'm on my third trip to the dealer today.  Might I suggest you not be fooled by her beauty and go to the internet for some facts.  the dealer says there are no problems with this transmission... buyer beware."
mercury,mountaineer,2006,Mark, 10/03/2007,Terrible Transmission,3,"Mostly a very nice SUV. Many good qualities. As others have said, the transmission is a major concern and problem. Between 3500 and 8500 miles the transmission began shifting harsh between 1/2 gears. It was so harsh it felt like I was being bumped from behind nearly every time I was about to stop. Now after 21000 miles Ford has yet to find a fix, and refuses to acknowledge that this is a serious problem. Another ""fix"" is promised in the future, but this usually is a computer program download that solves the problem for a month or two.  Be warned and stay clear of this model used or new until Ford can actually fix their new 6 speed electronic transmission."

Gas mileage could be better, but its an SUV. Would recommend to friends. Interior styling very ergonomic, and quite. V6 performance adequate. Gear shift is ok, but sometimes you feel the jerk. My wife loves to drive."
mercury,mountaineer,2006,Lou Gayoso, 05/09/2006,Montaineer 2006 SUV,4,"Love this SUV, which is my first SUV vehicle. I have been a passenger in several luxurious suv;s. this one is special, Mercury has a winnier competing against foriengn suv's; I have driven this suv on highways and city traffic, both of these esperiences were wonderful comfortable rides.  I love the handling, especially, the six cylinder which has enough power and gas savings for my taste. Although, gas is an issue these days, the Mountaineeer you can live with and its reults of gas mileage - remember you are driving a truck - that is certainly a surpise and i'm pleased that i own  a Mercury Mountaineer.  Linclon vehicles are luxurious an American product you can be proud of.  Buy One!! "

Do your self a favor."
mercury,mountaineer,2006,Paul J Foxcroft, 10/14/2008,Great Mariner,5,"Loaded with more features than my Mercedes. Only one minor problem in  32,000 miles. Get over 22 mpg on highway. Best trip was 25.5 mpg with wind behind from Fort Davis to San Angelo. Very quiet and smooth. This vehicle has fully restored my faith in American vehicles. Can hardly  wait for the MKS with the turbo engine to replace the Mercedes."
mercury,mountaineer,2006,jhalle, 12/26/2007,Very Nice SUV,4,"We just traded in our 2003 Mountaineer for a used 2006 Model.  We were very pleased with the previous model and are even more pleased with this one.  It handles much better than the 03 Model and the interior is much more luxurious.  Spent months comparing and trying 3 row SUV's.  This was by far the best value.  Sure the Highlander and Pilot were a little more refined but not enough to justify the extra $8000-$10000 price tags.  Wish they would not have changed lift gate.Paid $17,500 for a loaded model with 19,000 miles on it.  Some have complained of the door handles.  Though a little awkward at first you do get used to it within a week."

mercury,mountaineer,2006,Wayne, 02/03/2008,Mountaineer,3,"The vehicle I have drives well, but chugs when cold. It only runs well on high octane gas. The V6 pulls my boat with no issues. Gas mileage is about 11-12 city. "

I bought mine with 23 miles on it, two days later it was in the shop having a new instrument cluster put in. Even having the new instrament cluster put in, they still had problems with it and it still sits there now after 4 days! Hopefully this will be the only problem I will have as I have always had good luck with Ford products."

Each of the past vehicles has been a marked improvement over the prior mode. I have never been disappointed. Having owned to Blazers proir to my switch to Ford in 98, I can say hands down that Ford definitely HAS A BETTER IDEA.....The ride the wear ans the maintainance are far superior in a Ford Product. "

Love the V8 with 6 speed transmission.  Here is the flaw.  I am 6'2"" at 215lbs. The drivers seating area feels like it was designed by engineers 5'5"" at 155 LBs and drive with the seat all the way forward.  If I place the seat back, it is uncomfortable to reach for the steering wheel (not telescoping).  Also the seat is so small my legs begin to hurt. The padding is minimal so your sort of sitting on the outside frame of the seat. The seat is actually 1"" more narrow than the 2003 focus we own! Very disappointed in the ergonomics. The awkward door handle eats up even more room. If I could return it ...."
mercury,mountaineer,2006,yoleeta howell, 07/24/2006,Best Buy,5,"I purhased this vehicle after having owned 2 Izusu Rodeos since 1999 and a Trooper for 7 years. None of the  vehicles compare with the cost or quality of the Mountaineer.  It is powerful, classy and beautiful; it is the best vehicle I have ever owned and consider my money well-spent."

My only complaints is that it doesn't have a standard garage door opener button, and the door grips are too low and in an awkward spot. "
mercury,mountaineer,2006,Teresa, 11/15/2005,The Best Vehicle America Ever,5,We purchased this vehicle when my husband came back from iraq.  Our first suv and it is the best.

mercury,mountaineer,2006,Jeff, 02/11/2006,A nicely appointed package,5,"I traded in a 2001 Santa Fe for this and it is quite the upgrade.  It is so well packed with features and the quality of the ride, quietness is great.  It is smooth on the road with the 6 speed and it even has a gauge that tells you how effective your gas mileage is while your driving, so you can learn to get better.  I love it."
mercury,mountaineer,2006,Paul C., 05/28/2006,My First SUV too,4,"Wow, I was looking into a loaded Eddie Bauer and could not get the options that I was able to get with this 2006 Mountaineer.  I have every option except the Quad seat (have three kids) and the DVD Family Ent. Center (no jacks for games). I was able to get ""A"" Plan plus extra incentives for owning a 1999 Sable (almost $4600.00 off), I could not be happier.  This model year on the inside is a big improvement over 2005.  The ride is quiet and relaxing. "
mercury,mountaineer,2006,domwestbury, 06/12/2006,Nice ride,4,"We owned a 2003 explorer and never had a problem over the 60,000 miles we drove it for.  Never let us down.  As a result of this we decided to stay in the ford family.  We priced the explorer loaded and the mercury mountaineer loaded.  Much to our suprise the truck was about $2,000 less.  It was a no brainer we went with the mountaineer.  Overall the truck is quite an improvement over the 03 explorer, rides great, more comfortable, just nice all around.  The only draw back is the fuel mileage.  It could be better.  With the explorer we got spoiled after I changed the fluids to full synthetic.  With the explorer we got about 15 town, 23 highway.  the Merc gets 11 town 18 highway. "

mercury,mountaineer,2006,moe45, 09/19/2006,Love to drive,4,"This vehicle is a great step forward for the American car manufacturer.  The drive is superb, confort and handling are outstanding.  It's very easy to forget you are driving a ""truck"" as the drive feels like a luxury car.  The V8 engine gives you very smooth power throughout all the six gears of the automatic transmission.  The rear ""power"" 6th and 7th passenger seats are comfortable for an average size adult.  My wife, 5'2"", loves the adjustable foot pedal which allow her to drive at a safe distance from the steering wheel.  The interior is very nicely appointed with a modern clean but yet luxurious look and feel.  It all works, no rattles, no squeaks, no interior parts falling off, ""great"""

mercury,mountaineer,2006,Danyse Keiser, 01/05/2007,2006 Mercury Mount.,4,My husband and I have had this SUV for one year. So far it has been the best vehicle we have ever purchased. It is comfortable and fun to drive. the kids love the DVD player and T.V. We now have peaceful trips to the beach. Thanks LLM.
mercury,mountaineer,2006,mona, 01/09/2007,Surprise,4,"After 2 months of agonizing over which vehicle to buy I finally decided on the Mountaineer. I gave serious consideration to the Toyota 4Runner but overall the Mountaineer won me over. This vehicle has auto lights and a few other things that only the limited 4Runner is equipped with. The 4Runner is also overpriced IMHO. I also had a really hard time getting comfortable in the 4Runner. I always felt like I was facing downward; it was a weird perspective so I finally gave up on it. I love the way this truck rides. Very powerful for a V6 and not as noisy as the 8. Very pleased overall although I do not like the interior door handle, just too awkward to grasp."
mercury,mountaineer,2006,Jen from Indiana, 01/11/2007,Love it!!! Love it!!! Love it!!!,5,"I traded in my Escape for the Mountaineer and absolutely love it. Wanted something bigger, but not too big and this was a perfect fit. Wasn't planning on getting the fully loaded version and definitely didn't need it, but I noticed a BIG difference between the basic model and this (and didn't have a lot of choices for the good price). This drove much better than the basic model! I read lots of reviews before buying and I would say the petty things that were complained about aren't worth deterring you from this vehicle. If you try the Premier, you won't settle for the basic model. The difference is remarkable and worth it! Not really a complain "
mercury,mountaineer,2006,Jay, 01/18/2007,Luxurious SUV with Manners,5,"This is my first Mercury Mountaineer and I am very happy with the vehicle.  It is a luxurious SUV that can be purchased at a very good price.   The layout of the console is nice and very attractive.  I really like the more refined looks of the detailing on the Mountaineer when compared to other SUVs.    For an SUV the vehicle rides smoothly down the road.  The engine performance of the V6 is adequate, and the transmission is smooth.   Mercury really has a winner!!!"
mercury,mountaineer,2006,wmagon, 05/08/2007,Educated Buyer - Met all expectations,4,"After researching all of the real SUV's on the market, i.e. ones that can seat 7, fit in your garage, look stylish, be fun to drive, and still pull something reasonable, this and the Explorer are your only vehicles that will meet your needs. I worked for the US automotive industry a few years back, left, bought a Camry, but have since returned to my roots. After a lot of investigation, I was quite impressed with the Mountaineer specifications. Now that I own it, I am confident it was the right decision. My wife feels the same way. Gas mileage, well, you'll have to get over that. Do your homework there as well and you'll find that it's not so bad. Good luck. "
mercury,mountaineer,2006,Richard Miller, 08/30/2007,1 year ownership,4,"Solid SUV with all the features we wanted including a strong towing capability. One body flaw found was a piece of weld metal the size of a pea on the roof that was painted over. No trips to service in a year and everything functions well. Quiet ride and very comfortable on long trips. Steering and suspension seem to be a little looser than Explorers with similar equipment but not a major detractor.  Easily handles our 6000 lb boat and the standard hitch integrates nicely. Wish the mileage was better but all things considered, we are very happy after one year of ownership."
mercury,mountaineer,2006,gldnbr2, 10/10/2007,"Great SUV, but bad transmission",3,"The Mountaineer is a solid SUV with many good qualities. It's somewhat quiet inside and doesn't have any rattles after 22,000 miles. The AWD is excellent in poor weather conditions. The inside door handles (which are lacking for the most part) are very poorly located and difficult to use. They improved this design in 2007. The worst part of this vehicle is the transmission. It began slipping and hesitating at 4000 miles, then it got worse. At around 8000 miles it started to slam into 1st gear from 2nd gear when stopping.  Feels like somebody hit me from behind. Now after 22,000 miles, Ford has yet to find a fix for this very annoying problem. I know others are having the same problem."
mercury,mountaineer,2006,chris61, 10/21/2007,6 speed transmission a problem,3,"My wife and I replaced our 1999 Mountaineer with this 2006 Premier 2WD. She really likes her car, and for the most part, I do too. I'm not disappointed with the gas mileage, as we knew going in it wasn't going to win any economy championships. My biggest disappointment has been with the six speed transmission. We currently have 25000 miles on it, and it has been back to the dealer for the trans too many times to count. The problem is with the 1/2 upshift and 2/1 downshift. The problem is especially noticeable on the first drive of the day. If you don't come to a complete stop it won't shift all the way to first, then almost ""stumbles"" until you're into 2nd. They replaced the MTronics last."
mercury,mountaineer,2006,John, 03/19/2008,Great Vacation Vehicle,4,My wife and I bought this vehicle in March 06 with a sign and drive lease deal.  We have had no problems at all. We have driven to California and Washington State from Ohio. We had 22 MPG on the highway until we got the the Mountains but overall average 19.5 MPG for the trip.  It had good power in the Mountains even as a V6. Kids like the DVD entertainment package however that is the only time we have used it.  Excellent vacation vehicle with plenty of storage. 
mercury,mountaineer,2007,Mike Philpott, 12/17/2006,Super Nice SUV,4,Have owned this '07 Mountaineer Premier for just two weeks (and 600 miles) but it's already an irreplaceable member of the household.  We like just about everything about the Mountaineer.  Looks great (love the color - White Chocolate paint with two-tone tan leather interior - as well as the overall style) plus it's very comfortable to drive and extremely stable on the road.  We also like the fact that the 3rd row seats fold down flat into the floor at the touch of a button and will accommodate two full-grown adults in at least semi-comfort.  We are very happy with our purchase.  A great vehicle that I'm sure we will enjoy for many years to come. 
mercury,mountaineer,2007,4010diesel, 07/01/2011,Member of the Family,4,"We have had our Mountaineer since the middle of 2008.
We could not be more satisfied.
I have utilized every feature and function of this vehicle.
Including the roof rack, Class II hitch, AWD, cargo area, child seating, etc., etc.
We have 3 children all of which are able to fit in the second row, leaving the rear cargo area available.
The stereo is strong, the power is sufficient, the gas mileage is fair for an SUV, it easily tows my boat, powers thru 12"" of snow, is smooth on the highway, and is a joy to drive.
Although our V-6 is far from a performance engine I find that is provides all the pep I need and is relatively quiet considering the size of the vehicle."
mercury,mountaineer,2007,Hillary, 09/13/2010,Twice the pleasure,4,"This is my second mountaineer and I do tend to agree with most that my 2002 was better built, the engine was more powerful (v8) yet the fuel economy was good for such a big suv.  With that said, I also love my 2007.  I have done nothing but oil changes (66,000) and never had any kind of work on it.  I have five kids of my own and also use it for work transporting kids and the interior (leather) cleans easily.  No problems with any plastic parts inside its actually pretty solid."
mercury,mountaineer,2007,rmb181, 11/30/2006,2007 V6 Mountianeer,5,"I've had this vehicle for about a week and I am very pleased with it.

mercury,mountaineer,2007,jhood1590, 04/14/2010,An average vehicle,4,"This is my second mountaineer, I bought it brand new and got a deal because the mercury dealership was going out of business.  The interior quality has decreases dramatically from the 2002 model I previously drove.  It looks nice inside, just cheaply quality.  Navigation makes it look very nice, and is very functional.  Sound system is great.  Exterior quality is OK.  The paint has always been excellent on Fords, but the rims are a real problem.  I don't recommend the polished aluminum rims.  They have a terrible protective coat and a week of salt will destroy them. Ford customer service has always been awful, but the vehicles are a pretty good deal."
mercury,mountaineer,2007,Premier, 06/05/2010,Nice Looking Vehicle,3,"Great vehicle except the retractable running boards, need grease fitting to lube joints.  Super vehicle in the ice/snow.  Had to have the transmission adjusted at 10k miles. Suggest Ford look at the transmission in these vehicles, does not shift smoothly at low speeds."

mercury,mountaineer,2007,Meg, 08/11/2009,Not Satisfied,3,"This is the 3rd explorer/mountaineer in my family, and I am very disappointed.  The first two were fabulous cars, hence I bought another one.  It is 2.5 years old, 42,000 miles, and I've had the following replaced (accident-free):  tires, rims, shifter, radiator, intake fan, and belt.  A new car should not need so many repairs especially when it is well maintained."
mercury,mountaineer,2007,rmb181, 01/25/2007,Great SUV,4,"I have owned this SUV for about 2 months and have just over 1400 miles on it.  My wife and I just love this SUV.  Between the styling (both inside and out) and the comfort, this SUV is the best car I have ever owned.  There's not one day where I don't like driving it.  The interior is comfortable with the leather seating, third row and power fold down feature.  The Mountaineer comes with more features than the Explorer in the same price range.  Only suggestion I could make is to splurge and get the V8 engine.  The V6 is a little sluggish, although it consumes gas like the V8.  That's the only complaint I have with this SUV is the gas mileage.  Other than that, my wife and I love it.  Buy it!"
mercury,mountaineer,2007,Rick Radke, 10/29/2018,Money pit,3,"Bought this vehicle at 52,000 miles in 2013.  Pros: High ground clearance, handles pot holes, curbs, and other road hazards with impunity.  Very stable in all weather conditions.

Cons: Since then, it had a total transmission failure, more than a few problems with the engine cooling system, two expensive computer repairs, a broken heater blend door, and a few other repairs.  The factory alloy wheels corroded, causing frequent tire pressure loss.  At this point, it seems like we've replaced everything but the engine.  

Power is adequate, but gas mileage is around 12 MPG.  If I had a do-over, I would have bought a different SUV."
mercury,mountaineer,2007,Steve &Bonnie, 09/06/2008,Best SUV I ever owned,4,"Very solid, safe well mannered vechicle. A real pleasure to drive on a long trip. We got up to 24 mpg, average 21-22 on long trips. Mileage varies depending on the brand of fuel you buy. Yes it does make a difference, I proved it to myself. I am curious though to see how well the AWD works as we will be going off road [within reason don't expect it to beat the trails I take with my Jeep] in Arizona this fall."
mercury,mountaineer,2007,davdor, 04/21/2007,They just keep getting better,4,"This is my fourth Mountaineer and there are significant improvements since 2005. The V8 is smooth and quiet, and the ride is much smoother. There is very little road noise and the body appears to be stiffer. A consuner magazine claims the Mountaineer has above average mechanical problems, but I have never had even one. "
mercury,mountaineer,2007,Hinrich, 03/26/2008,2007 Mercury Mountaineer V8 AWD Premier,3,"This is our 5th Mountaineer and not the best we had. Quite a few problems within the first 14,000 miles (check engine light on, 6-speed transmission shifting abrupt, airbag light on, bad body panel and door fit, rust on some body parts) required multiple dealer visits. The engine is powerful and more refined compared to the 2004 model we drove before. Gas mileage is bad, get about 14 MPG in mixed driving. Truck is comfortable except for a choppy ride over short bumps. Interior comfort is good with lots of space (I'm 6'6"" tall). Quality of some interior materials a step back from 2004 model."

Mileage is an honest 13 mpg in heavy city driving and getting slightly better as it gets miles. The mileage on the road is where it really shines, it is easy to get 19-22+ mph on the open road. Combined mileage has been a solid 16+ mpg for our type of driving. I love the performance of the V8 and the 6 speed is able to find the right gear when needed. The SUV is solid, quiet,and fun to drive. We own a 2000 Mustang GT 5 speed that we love and I am shocked that I find my self wanting to take the Mountaineer on trips where the road is twisty. The Mountaineer really handles nice, and just feels right."
mercury,mountaineer,2007,hajji, 12/25/2007,It's a great ride for the price,5,It's my third one and they only get better. I never had to go back to the dealer for any problems. Looks good and drives great. I couldnt be happier.
mercury,mountaineer,2007,iceout, 12/26/2007,A great vehicle,4,This is truly a great SUV.  It handles great is reliable and fun to drive but most important it is very versatile from carrying up to 7 passengers to haling a lot of stuff (84 cu.ft.) and I have done both. The high ground clearance makes back road travel a breeze without worry of going over a rock in the road doing damage.
mercury,mountaineer,2007,Harry Marks, 12/18/2008,One great SUV,4,"I purchased my 2007 Mountaineer last March. For me this has been one fantastic vehicle. My average gas mileage was around 18.5mpg in combined driving and 25 on the open highway with three adults. The optional steering wheel controls for the radio, fan, and cruise were fantastic. I never needed to take my eyes off the road to make adjustments. The optional 3rd row seating came in handy on more than one occasion and were easy to operate.  The only thing I did not like were the gaps in the cargo area when the 3rd row seats were stowed. I frequently haul a set of timpani (kettle drums) and the wheels wanted to fall in the cracks. Other than that, I love the vehicle."
mercury,mountaineer,2007,Ksde4321, 12/26/2008,Best SUV on Market,4,We have owned this SUV for 2 years and have had absolutely no problems with it. It drives well both around town and on the highway. It is equally adept at towing a trailer or taking us out for a night on the town. If you need a car that gets over 30 mpg then get a Smart for 2. But if you need a vehicle that can do anything you ask of it then this is the one.
mercury,mountaineer,2007,Vic, 01/05/2009,Very Satisfied,4,This is the third SUV I have owned and am very satisfied with its ride and reliability. I can't say enough good things about this vechicle. I would definitely recommend it!
mercury,mountaineer,2007,vusford1, 09/30/2007,Solid ride,3,"I mostly enjoy my new Mountaineer. It has pretty good comfort in all rows, has a smooth ride, and decent handling for a truck- based suv, however I do wish that fit and finish was a little better, as I have had some minor problems. Ford motor company quality control could be better"
mercury,mountaineer,2007,Ray, 06/20/2007,New Purchase Observations,4,"We've had the Mountaineer a little over a week now and we are very happy with our purchase. I got all the features I wanted: luxury with towing power, but not a huge SUV that is unweildy to handle in city traffic and a problem parking. I particularly liked all the luxury features being ""standard"" on the Mercury vs. optional equipment on the Ford Explorer. I think I got a great value for the price. "
mercury,mountaineer,2007,Vic Costa, 03/25/2008,2007 Mercury Mountaineer great value!,4,I have nothing but good things to say about this SUV. It does all I need it do do with comfort and style! Value wise it is a great investment. I have had zero problems.
mercury,mountaineer,2007,1st time Merc owner, 03/28/2008,1st time Mountaineer owner,3,"We've been SUV drivers forever, live in rural area, and this has been a nice surprise. Purchased this Mountaineer replacing our Ford Explorer that had 170,000 plus miles. Took it on it's first road trip to the mountains for skiing and the comfort level was top notch. We are also impressed with the quiet ride this SUV has as opposed to our older Explorer. Average gas mileage on this 500 plus mile trip ranged between 18-22 mpg which is what we are used to with SUV's. Love having the reclining second row seats in this Mountaineer since we didn't have it on the Explorer. Cargo space was great for all our ski gear. "
mercury,mountaineer,2007,Hinrich, 04/01/2008,"Not bad, but needs improvements",3,"We had our Mountaineer for 10 months and 15,000 miles and the experience has been mixed so far. It's our 5th Mountaineer and we love the overall package (exterior size vs. interior space), the powerful V8 engine and the features (Navigation system, great audio system). But we had issues and some couldn't be fixed yet. The 6-speed transmission shifts hards after accelerating from a standstill and was checked twice. Fit and finish is bad, body panels and doors needed adjustment. Fuel mileage is poor at best, we average 13.5 mpg in mixed driving. Handling is worse than with our 2004 Mountainer (18"" Michelin tires, don't work well in snow either). Overall no big improvement to the 2004 model."

Just oil changes, and normal maintenance.  An engine that’s totally reliable, Runs great and only had to replace e heater hose and front wheel bearing. Had I bought a new car in 2016 I would have paid $14,000 to this point in payments .
My maintenance on the Mounty with tires and all normal  maintenance is less that $4000. That’s value in my book

After several attempts at Ford Lincoln Mercury dealerships to fix the problem it still exists.The alternator,starter bad relay and battery have all been replaced yet several times a week I am left stranded somewhere with this defective vehicle that won't start.I have been in communication with the Ford Cust.

mercury,mountaineer,2008,Chris, 10/19/2007,No other SUV comes close to Mountaineer,4,"This is a great SUV. Mercury really put their effort and time in this vehicle. All the details are very thought out and has a very stylish exterior and interior. It is very spacious and will fit any large family with up to 7. I really like how nice the ride is and is very comfortable. We were looking at other vehicles to consider, but we made a very smart choice and got this. This is a perfect SUV for a single person or a family of 7. And the V8 engine is very powerful and its just an overall awesome vehicle to own."
mercury,mountaineer,2008,Pickivicki, 03/12/2017,My third Mountaineer,5,"Great work horse. Very little maintenance required. The transmission is completely sealed so there is no maintenance on that.

mercury,mountaineer,2008,Ron, 08/31/2008,"Love the SUV, but poor interior quality",4,"We love the room, the ride, the v8 power, the appearance, and we know from the past that we will love the AWD. The MPG is acceptable for an AWD mid-size SUV. We test drove the vehicle on a bright sunny day 98 F and heard no rattles or noises, but took delivery in the evening after sundown, temp 71F. On the way home the upper console started making an annoying noise when we hit seams in the road. We made 2 visits to fix the problem. Another Mountaineer that hadn't been prepped did the same thing, as did the 08 Explorer Rental. Service manager said that if more than 2 do the same, then Ford would say they're built that way. Excuse me? Dealer put foam in that area. Problem solved for now?  "
mercury,mountaineer,2008,dan ertel, 07/19/2008,Hard to Improve On,4,"This is my third Mountaineer (had a 2002 & 2005). They keep getting better. Fuel economy not a factor due to my low mileage - comfort, safety, traction in the snow, room to transport items and style, these are what counts to me and the Mountaineer is a 10 in all respects. Large lease discount from Ford makes this vehicle a great deal."
mercury,mountaineer,2008,Bill Skip, 02/04/2019,Great used car purchase,5,"We bought this car 2 years ago and I couldn’t be happier. Great family hauler with the third row seats. Great AWD system that cuts through Michigan winters with ease. Only abnormal repairs were thermostat housing and fuel rail pressure sensor so far. Why ford made the thermostat housing out of plastic?! pretty dumb but luckily there is an aftermarket aluminum one I replaced it with. I’ll never have to worry about it leaking again. Changing the fuel rail pressure sensor gave me a chance to also clean the intake and a full time-up with ease (plugs, wires, coil pack etc.). It just hit 100k miles and still runs and drives like new. We take a trip to Florida every year it’s a dream to drive. "

mercury,mountaineer,2010,fordman, 12/24/2009,Great Vehicle,4,"Being one of the last true SUVs on the market this could use some improvement in the model offerings and options.

I have about 800 miles on it and the temperature is below freezing or zero and the gas mileage is 19.5 on dash computer.  Fuel economy on this vehicle is under rated.  Wish it would burn E-85.  six speed transmission would have been nice also.  Wanted Premier model but was not offered in 5 seat version.  The AWD is super on the snow and ice.  Very quiet and comfortable vehicle with lots of cargo space and back seat room.  "

Even though I live at 5280 ft ASL my little 4.0 V6 runs like a rocket and this truck is beautiful. Gas mileage is what you would expect for a truck, about 14 MPG around town but I use it mainly for going to the gym, shopping, etc. Lots of room in the rear for big stuff and a DVD-video player for the grand kids (someday). Might be the last SUV I can buy with a truck frame under it. Nice sound system with bluetooth for hands-free phone. With the moon roof open I feel like I'm outside. Well protected with front and side airbags. This quiet truck will take my anyplace I need to go."
mercury,mountaineer,2010,aldaton, 02/12/2016,Great UNTIL....,2,"2010 Mercury Mountaineer bought 2 1/2 years ago with about 60k miles on it. I love how the 3rd row seats fold into the floor with a push of a button. I like the height, and my 90 year old friend can get in and out of the passenger seat without a step, with assistance. I have a toddler and it was nice not having to bed into a car to strap him into a car seat. The 3rd row seat is apparently pretty uncomfortable, and isn't easily accessible. It's ok for short trips on rare occasion. 

It got me around in hilly/rainy Pacific NW for 2 1/2 years without major repairs, until a couple months ago, at about 79000 miles. No accidents (only off-roading has been driveways). Despite routine maintenance, we've had to completely replace both the brake system and the power transfer case (total: about $5k), both destroyed due to the fluids inside leaking out. The thermostat, a hub, and the Navigation system have needed work or replacement as well. Every winter I've has to have a tube flushed due to debris (pine needles and such) coming in through the sunroof , causing rain in the car coming from the light  console. (said indoor rain has killed a couple of my personal electronics). The Nav isn't user friendly anyway, I ended up using my phone most of the time anyway before it broke (or disconnected in the wiring?.. we're working on that problem now).
Now I realize my  descriptions may not be the most accurate, but my mechanic hubby understood and agreed with all the repairs, and has fixed some of it himself)

 If somehow it has very few miles on it I would say to get it, but otherwise I own a 6 yr old car with a lack of power that's required major repairs (that don't usually happen to cars under a decade old).

mercury,mountaineer,2010,David Helms, 08/28/2015,Upgrade Gone Wrong,3,"Previously, we had a 2007 Ford Explorer Eddie Bauer, but after it was totaled in an accident, we went with the Mountaineer for a ""touch of class"" so to say. The exterior is a little give and take... Yeah, it's nice and all, but when you park next to the previous generation Mountaineer; there really is not much of a difference.  The interior is alright... It has the same options as the Explorer. I just wish it had came with better color combinations. Not to mention, it drives practically the same. It's a little disappointing honestly, I bought this thinking it would be a step above the Explorer, but it's kind of a step below. Reliability wise, it's solid. But beware of a few electrical issues here and there.

 After only about a week I realized how peppy the 3.0 V6 is. I was very much accustomed to the thriftiness of 4 cylinder cars, but when I began regularly driving the Sable I was not only impressed but satisfied.

A box of ArmorAll, some new floor mats, a steering wheel cover, some 'self-fixing' coolant fluid, and an oil change later, and WOW!

mercury,sable,2000,Bernd Langer, 03/04/2002,Sable,5,This vehicle has proved to be the quality one would expect from a new car purchase.  I have had only one warranty item the car needed to be returned to the dealer for.  The interior luxury and space for a taller person is wonderful.  For years I have driven a cramped import or small economical car and this is a welcome change.  If this car prove to be as reliable long term as my escort and Toyota corona and camry were then it was well worth. it.

so tired of bringing the car in for 
various recalls and other problems (in 
fact, I need to call the dealer 
tomorrow to find out why my car is now 
leaking transmission fluid).  Time in 
the shop is compounded by an inept 
dealer repair shop.  Problems are not 
fixed right the first time.  When it's 
not in the shop, the car is actually 
very pleasant to drive - great pickup 
and very smooth even at high speeds.  
However, it's just not worth the effort 
anymore.  We also own a Hyundai Santa

has a better warranty."

years.  It has 25,000 miles on it.  I 
really like the car.  The interior, 
paint, & 24 valve V6 are all great.  
Like others have stated on the 2000 
Sable there have been too many recalls 
of which most were not necessary (in my 
opinion).  My car also has a very 
slight oil leak and a rear window/trunk 
leak which 2 different dealers can not 
fix.  They are annoying little problems 
that should have been fixed.  Ford 
needs to get there designs tested 
before sending them out to the 
consumer.  There ""Quality is Job 1"" is 
a joke.  The little problems that I 
have had and the number of recalls 
should have been caught."
mercury,sable,2000,Jackie Lindsay, 10/09/2003,Better than a van,5,"I have 2 boys just turning teenagers. 
This car will hold up to 7 people. It 
drives great and the gas milage for a 
car this size is great. The middle and 
back seat can be layed down. My 
husband loves it. He always wanted a 
small truck. I always wanted a luxury 
car and my kids wanted a van. We've 
got everything all in one reasonably 
priced family car. The front of the 
Mercury is much more grand than the 
front of the Ford wagon. It also has 
anti-theft and cordless entry. I don't 
think the Ford does. We have had no 
mechanical problems at all. The car is 
also very easy to see out of from all 
angles. Backing is a breeze."

During the first year, the back spring broke and punctured the rear tire while I was driving. (They had a recall to put a guard on the tire because the front springs were having this problem, but no reimbursement for the back.) In the past few months, I've replaced the alternator, entire engine and now the transmission is leaking fluid. My dad had to replace the engine in his Mercury Grand Marquis around the 140,000 mark as well. The back suspension has always been creaking - sounds like the back end is going to fall off when you have people in it."
mercury,sable,2000,Tom Kennett, 05/04/2019,Old snooze still works ok,4,"The brakes and transmission will more than likely fail, especially the brakes many times over 20 years. The transmission at least once. The engine is stout but after 20 years, hard to find parts. Mine needs exhaust headers. The cost of ownership over time will be high but on the upside, you will get many miles out of it. It is a true wagon so I will keep it for nostalgia.

the money. In over 65,000 miles of 
driving I have had no repairs 
whatsoever. It's a comfortable car to 
drive and handles well in all weather. 
I've been particularly impressed with 
the Continental Touring Contact all-
season tires. A couple of minor gripes; 
the lack of a standard CD player is 
anoying. There are some blind spots 
with the large A and B pillars that 
take some getting used to. The overall 
ride could be a little firmer, and Ford 
needs to do something about the mushy 
transmission shift points; it hates to 
downshift inless you prod it with the 
gas. The 3 liter V6 is one of the best 
powerplants on the road today."

family demands and shoe horning oneself 
into a car isn't much fun. I needed a 
sedan that was within my budget and had 
good handeling, accelerates and fun to 
drive. Two family menbers own V6 sedans 
one was a Toyota Camry, the other a 
Sable 24V. Seeing the Sable was 
American made, better seating, and less 
bland styling, I opt'd for the Sable. 
Performance, handling and ride between 
the two cars is similiar, the Camry is 
slightly quicker off the line, the 
Sable is slightly quicker on the upper 
end of the tach. Fit and finish are 
good, no rattles or squeks. "

my Sable.  It is fun to drive.  What I 
have not enjoyed was the multiple trips 
to the dealer to fix problems.  Most 
were minor electrical problems but 1 
took 5 trips to the dealer to resolve 
the problem.  The transmission needed 
to be replace with only 45,000 miles. 
The verdict is still out if I would buy 
another one.  They would need to 
convince me that there quality control

car and I like it as well as the 
Infinity.

Due to our experience with this car, 
we bought another one... a 2001. They 
seem almost identical with maybe the 
ride being a little better with the 
2000. We still own both at this time.

The ride is great and a very quite 
(every bit as quite as the Infinity)

mercury,sable,2000,JimmySolo, 02/26/2008,Excellent performer w/ style,4,"I got my LS my fr yr at school, and it was by far the best choice for the money (8000). With a few $ spent, this car outshines many others. A great handling car, esp 4 a sedan--(my car before this was a Mustang) My Sable does not have the 24V V6, but the regular 3.0 Vulcan is not too shabby.  Best places to spend money on this car: I put in brighter headlt bulbs ($20), improved ceramic front pads w/ better rotors ($150), synthethic fluids ($50), removed air intake silencer & add K&N filter ($45), installed better fog lamps ($50), & put on better tires ($400)--w/these simple adds, the car is fun to drive & great on gas (28 mpg!). Only problem w/ mine is a stubborn driver door in cold weather."
mercury,sable,2000,beancounter, 11/29/2005,"154,000 & going strong",4,"Very satisfied. Car runs (and looks) like the day I bought it with 16,000 miles. Engine is the std 6, so pinging comes std with that if you try to run reg gas. Performance is much better on 90+ octane, plus you eliminate the damage caused by the pinging and greatly extend eng life. The better fuel economy offsets the higher gas price. I bought the car w/ every intention of going 200,000 to 250,000 miles and I have no doubt it will do it. Very comfortable to drive. Seats are firm and supportive. And I can squeeze out 29 - 30 mpg on the hiway if I try hard. (The most I could get on 89 oct was 28.) I replaced the starter last summer. The rest has been routine maint and a few minor things."

It's very unassuming--but it serves its purpose: reliable transportation.  The moon roof is a great feature as is the ventiliation (something that always stands out with Fords).  Good buy at an exceptional price back in '00."

some problems (suspension and tire 
wear) overall the car is okay.  Mostly, 
I am sick of Ford taking me to the 
cleaners anytime something goes wrong 
with the car.  Even the Ford dealership 
can't perform normal maintenance, they 
generally have to replace large 
portions of the car rather then faulty 
part (no wheel bearings on this car 
[$10] only wheel hubs [$75]).  If you 
ask me it sounds like blatant planned 
obsolesce.  I think this is the last

The other problem that I have had is the leather on the rear door panels keep falling off. I have had them glued back on four times. I was told that the leather was cut too short. Other than these problems it has been a solid low maintenance vehicle.

mercury,sable,2000,chevyman19, 10/23/2007,Decent but not great!,3,"I bought the car in September of 2006 and I wish I wouldn't have because the fifth day I had to spend $500 to get my intake fixed, and I've spent over $800 dollars trying to get my a/c fixed and still is not fixed right. When I accelerate hard it blows warm, and another 5 months after that I broke down on the side of the road because my transmission had gone out on it.

Our local Ford/Mercury dealer is 
clueless for service so I do it myself

The ride under most conditions is very 
smooth and comfortable. The steering 
and handling are excellent. There no 
steering wheel feedback on rough roads. 
There no  ""torque"" steering while under 
acceleration. The engine is quite under 
acceleration and little or no high revs 
noise during acceleration changes. The 
MPG on road trips at speeds of 65-70MPH

mercury,sable,2000,RMiller, 07/13/2017,It's a money pit,2,"Where do I start? I bought this used and the problems started right away. The air conditioner has never worked. It only has am/fm stereo and you have to turn the volume up to make the volume go down, and vice versa. The front passenger side electric window gets stuck open so I have to keep it shut in 108 degree weather, and no ac, remember. It won't hold more than one person in the back seat because the wheel wells rub on the tires, and nobody is overweight! When I took it to the shop, they told me that was normal because these cars are made to ""glide""??? Why is there two seats back there then? The covers on all of the door panels have come off and keep coming off after being glued back on. Have had to replace or fix too many things to type out, that have cost me at least $4,000. Several recalls for things that I didn't have to pay for. (that's the only good thing I can say about this car) Now I think the transmission is slipping, but I'm disabled and on a fixed income and can't afford to have it checked. I also can't afford to get another car, so it won't be long until I will be taking the friggen city bus to shop for groceries. Worst car ever, I don't understand how it got so many good reviews.

My reason for getting rid of it was 
that when passing I would give the car

Other things, I would consider to be maintenance, have had to be fixed/replaced (calipers, spark plugs/wires, upper/lower intake mainfold gaskets, etc).

However it turned out my car didn't have the original radio in it, which means the previous owner put in the wrong installed a radio that messed everything up.

Engine started leaking oil and blowing anti-freeze out recovery tank.  Found a leaking oil seal, and blown head gasket.  Transmission has a shudder when shifting either up or down.  Mechanic says it is a common problem with that make of transmission.  Heater core has to be flushed almost bi-weekly in order to have any heat in the winter time.  It seems those intelligent engineers designed a by-pass hose that allows rust and sediment to gather in the heater core and then it get stopped up and coolant will not circulate through the heater core.  To correct this issue will cost $500!  Paid $3500 for car and have now spent in excess of $2500 in repair bills.  Now have over $6000 in a car that books for $2500.   Have to go now.  I hear the phone ringing.  Hope it's the GM dealer calling.

mercury,sable,2001,Hans, 04/11/2008,So far so good in the Sable,4,"I've had my Sable since November and so far it has been great. I'm 23 so I can't say I love the car, but it's done everything I've asked it to so far. I bought it as a fill in until I can buy something I really like, and it's been great. I occasionally drive about 4 hours to see my family and the Sable has performed wonderfully. I get roughly 27 mpg on the highway and between 17-20 around town. Mine is the base model with almost no options, but it performs great for what it is. Very solid, reliable sedan with room to spare."
mercury,sable,2001,Lenny L, 07/17/2004,Auto Review,4,"  With both rear seats down, I find the 
Cargo space is comparable to 80% of the 
SUVs on the market. This vehicle is an 
excellent alternative for someone who 
needs cargo space but does not want to 
endure the harsh road handling traits 
of most SUVs with their poor gas 
mileage.       
  Excellent performance from its 
Duratek V6 Engine, lots of passing 
power. Great road handling ability 
makes it a pleasure to drive.   "
mercury,sable,2001,JB, 03/19/2005,Love It.,4,"This car hauls... Don't be fooled by it's family sedan/granny car appearance Everytime that I've let someone else drive it they end up squealing the tires their first time behind the wheel, it has a lot more get-up-and-go than they expect.  Nice comfy ride and roomy interior. I haven't had any major problems yet..(knock on wood) speaking of..the woodgrain interior looks pretty nice and I love the stainless steel door handles.  I've been considering buying a new car but don't want to part with my Sable."

I paid $5,000 for the car and have put $4,000 in it and still have nothing but junk!"
mercury,sable,2001,jetgirl77, 09/17/2012,Still Rolling,3,"I bought my Sable used at 85K miles.
I now have 147K miles on it and still rolling along.
I've replaced the blower motor, IAC valve, ignition coil and of course had the door panels reglued when they fell down, but with the inexpensive used price it's hard to complain.
Just took it through the mountains of WV and got 28.5-29.75 mpg at 70+.
Get about 21 mpg around town.
Comfortable ride on the highway.
I'm going to have trouble finding a replacement when the time comes."
mercury,sable,2001,Merck, 05/05/2002,Lemons,1,"This is the second Sable GS in one 
year.  The first was returned because 
of transmission problems---A dangerous 
surge. Dealership wanted to put in a 
new transmission but I declined and was 
given another new Sable. The second one 
is also a dud.  Transmission seems to 
be our of sync with engine.  Idling is 
so fast and within specs that it can 
travel 5 mph without touching the 
accelerator! Both Sables have a 
dangerous vibration on the steering 
wheel after going 65 miles an hour. By 
getting another Sable I believed I 
would have no problems but I've been 
back for repairs more that 5 times.  I 
don't recommend it to anyone."

12,000 miles.  Then the transmission 
problems started.  First, a dealership 
told me that I had plenty of warranty 
left to figure it out.  A month later,  
dealership couldn't replicate the 
problem, but replaced a tran sensor.  
Now, the dealership replaced the 
transmission with a remanufactured, 
without telling me first.  Still drives 
questionably, but it looks like I'm 
stuck with it.  The service dept, my 
salesman, and Ford's Customer Relations 
act like I should be thrilled that I

mercury,sable,2001,The Expert, 10/09/2009,What A Pile,1,First I cannot admit that I could bring myself to purchase this car because it is not my car but my parents'.  I have used it over the years as a loaner when needed.  I have driven many American cars and currently own a 2004 Honda Accord and a 2010 Toyota Camry.  This car is such a pile that it is hard to be intellectual about it.  I won't go into the endless maintenance problems and monies spent but just say that it is so joyless and clunky to drive.  It is a V6 yet drives as though it would rather be sitting in a pasture rusting.  It lumbers along and the shifting is clunky.  The best shape this car could be in is a cube at the junkyard.
mercury,sable,2001,Tony, 09/01/2008,Great Car,4,I have owned this car for 7 years. The only thing I've done is change tires and a battery. Car drives like a sports car and rides like a Lincoln. Great handling in mountain curves.

bald spots.  I am a 48 year old woman 
who has never driven hazardously.  I've 
always kept my cars for approximately 5 
years and trade them in when the milage

it runs on regular gas.  We got every 
feature there is for less than the 
base price of a SUV.  It's an 
incredible value and really very nice

The 24 valve Durotec engine is smooth and powerful.

to work at a Ford dealership in parts

is cause by the wheels not being 
balanced.  I took the car back to the 
dealership and told them that the 
wheels needed to be balanced.  Since I 
did this just a few days after buying 
the car they covered the charges even 
though wheel balancing isn't covered by

mercury,sable,2002,rstravis, 04/08/2011,"It's a sad, sad day.",5,"10 years ago, I sold Lincolns and Mercurys.
So when I needed to buy a car 5 years ago I knew the Sable was a good choice, as long as I got the LS (Duratec Engine).
I loved the engine, the leather, the power seat, etc., and knew that engin e was reliable.
I was right. 5 years with no major problems (just a blower motor which I fixed for 50 bucks). Just paid it off 3 weeks ago, and planned to drive it to 200k (it has 108 now), but I crashed today and the car is totalled.
4 car accident, and it was smashed pretty good.
 I was the first to get out of my car and felt fine besides a sore neck.
So that's one more reason to love my Sable.
I'll miss it."
mercury,sable,2002,Jaybee, 03/09/2002,2002 Mercury Sable LS Premium,5,"Great driving experience with this car, and gas mileage is good and the engine has lots of power. I am tall and fit comfortably in this car, which is more than I can say for the Camry which is built for people under 5' 4""."
mercury,sable,2002,Jobin, 12/23/2016,My first car....10 years later,4,"This car is a BEAST. I used and abused her as a teenager and she has SURVIVED through it all! Still running, after only basic oil changes maybe every 5000 miles. Def has some war stains in my Sable, and will most likely be wholesaled when I do decide to trade her in. (That will be a sentimental day which is ironic considering the first time I saw this car I was horrified my parents would choose something so hideious!) All in all she has really been super good to me. I have never been smoking on the side of the road, maybe replaced my battery 1 time, my starter 1 time, my tires 1 time (oops).  Super good, reliable, fuel efficient, safe, low key, no problems-take care of me-and I'll take care of you-car.

I can haul just as much stuff as I did in my '98 Explorer I before it.  Travels great on the highway and I get between 24-26 mpg and that is doing over 70 on the highway.

mercury,sable,2002,pyzik, 06/28/2012,This has been my favorite car,4,"I bought this car in 2005 after having a 1997 Sable GS.
The premium came with an extra 52hp which really added some pep.
The seats were comfortable but the leather was somewhat fragile (I made two small tears in the rear seat).
I got tons of complements when I had this car.
The exterior wasn't the greatest styling but the interior was wonderful.
I ended up selling it because there was a short in the electrical system that cause multiple wires to melt together causing a complete failure in the electrical system (did not effect the drivetrain.
Heater was stuck on, windows didn't work interior lights didn't work, instrument cluster didn't work.
I would still be driving this car otherwise."

mercury,sable,2002,alexr79, 09/26/2013,In a Class of Its Own,4,"A very good friend owns a 2002 Sable wagon with under 50000 miles on it.
We go on road trips in it a couple times a year and I am very impressed by it.
It is smooth, quiet, comfortable, and roomy.
It has decent power and gets about 29 mpg when we are traveling.
I love driving it and I am currently looking for a low mileage 2002 - 2005 Sable or Taurus wagon so I can get rid of my 2011 Equinox that is gutless and only gets 25 mpg on the highway."
mercury,sable,2002,Rob Bost, 01/28/2016,ABSOLUTELY One of the Worst Money Pits EVER!,1,"We bought this car used with 40,000 miles on it and drove it (sometimes) for nine years. I kept it simply because I am obviously poor. When I was lucky enough to trade the POS for a Civic (Yay!), I had barely managed put 148,000 miles on it. I drive nightly through five counties to work, about 62 miles or 1.25 hrs. one way. It left me walking three times in that period. Once was a broken throttle cable in the middle of a hot summer day. The next time was an electrical problem killing the lights in the middle of the night. The third and by far the worst was a failure of the computer that kills the ABS brake system. Every single seasonal weather change causes the ECM to send error signals all over the place. One of them will kill the ABS system. I put nearly a thousand dollars in the brake system over the years. This car is the only vehicle I've had in nearly 37 years that was literally dangerous to own. The plastic headlight lenses are made of cheap non-UV protected materials. They must be polished regularly to even see at night. They are $280 for one assembly if you buy new ones. If you park this car in the sun, the interior parts will eventually disintegrate. Each door panel came apart. Electrical switches failed on locks and windows. The electric mirror controls failed and fell off of the door panel, as did all the venting and A/C control knobs. The radio has the anti-friction volume control that NEVER worked. It also had a cassette drive!? Headliners break loose and fall at will. The dash and steering mechanism makes strange creaking noises from an ill fit. If there are any good points, the 3.0 V6 has plenty of power, but needs injectors constantly because of Ethanol gas. It barely got 23 mpg on the interstate. I also replaced the ignition module, and had a bad oil leak at the distributor shaft seal. When replacing a simple serpentine belt, a pulley made of cheap plastic broke and cost me another $85 to get replaced! Thankfully, the transaxle seemed ok. The seats are fully adjustable and comfortable for most adults and great if you have a couple of kids or riders. The suspension gives a smooth and quiet ride. The 16"" tires are still cheap, and that's great because the front end needs aligning every year. That's about all the good. In the end, the worst failure of all was the entire speedometer/tachometer/odometer cluster going on and off at will during cold weather. As you know, you must sign a legal liability document on the odometer mileage if you are ever lucky enough to get rid of this dose of the clap. If it goes completely out you will be stuck with nothing but a junk-valued heap that doesn't work and nobody will buy. I was so lucky to get one shiny day of sun last month. I now own two old Nissans and a 2013 Civic that are all trouble free and get great gas mileage. That's EXACTLY where my money will stay from now on.

mercury,sable,2002,Andrew, 02/19/2008,"I know I will get 300,000 miles",4," I needed a comuter car so it needed to be reliable. Pat Goss from Auto week mentioned that the drivetrain was bulletproof now I see why. My car is at its 5th owner and starts strong every time. I would have liked to have the LS with the 200hp but with switching the air filter to a K&N and using 93 octane fuel gets me close. I actually feel it gets better performance because with the LS the power is all top end. Peak torque starts at 2500 rpm so with only slight presure on the gas she moves. For handling all I needed to do was change to lower profile tires, now it will and has out cornered BMW's. "
mercury,sable,2002,Matt, 07/31/2010,I must have found the one lemon!,4,"Within 6 mos. the heat started coming on when we turned on the A/C. It still does this. No one can find the problem. Sometimes the heat comes on with the system off. My wife went to start the car in the parking lot at work and the air bags deployed. Glad she wasn't driving down the highway. I'm about to buy a Subaru. Maybe the air bags will wait for an accident to work. I will contact Ford about the issue. This car must have been built slowly on Mondays so everyone else got a good one. That would be a good plan to keep the workers with hangovers busy building lemons. I'm glad to here no one else has lived our nightmare. We still owe $3,500 on it. Anyone want a Sable for parts?"

Here's a list of the problems we've had: - ticking sound from under the hood that no one can figure out. - wheels puncture from issue with wheel well.

I purchased used with less than 55,000 miles and just turned over 80,000 miles.  In the last 18 months, I had to replace the fuel pump - car let me down while I was on vacation and I had to rent a car to get to my destination!  A month ago I replaced the right ball socket and head gasket. Ever since the head gasket was replaced, the heat doesn't work right - not good in the Northeast during the winter. Also, since the head gasket was replaced, the engine was making a chirping sound. From outside the vehicle, sounded like a belt slipping - it's the camshaft sensor! "

Love the LS. Don't like the 6 disc CD changer being in the trunk. I am not getting get the gas mileage I should. I might need a tune up. Do not like the cable gauges especially for the fuel. It goes up and down and I do not know if I need gas yet or not. On average I am getting 250mi on a tank when Edmunds say 350. Wish it had heated seats.

One big issue I have is the wheel wells are rusting like crazy. All behind the rocker panels is starting to really rust. Not really a fan of this. I try to keep this car as clean and nice looking as possible. To keep the car as luxury feeling as it I think it should be.  

Love the wood grain. Has that luxury feel to it since it has the chrome rims. Roomy as well. Nice car all over. Would defiantly recommend this car

mercury,sable,2003,Variseal, 01/13/2004,Mercury builds a winner!,4,"Bought an LS premium with the Duratec 
24V V6.  The engine makes a nice 
subdued growl at full throttle and 
pulls strongly at all speeds, right up 
to a governed 110 MPH.  Handling is 
above average for a large sedan but the 
ride is much more forgiving than the 
Regal/Grand Prix/Impala from GM. 
Interior is functional, user-friendly 
and comfortable, if not the most 
attractive I've seen.  The adjustable 
pedals are great for my 5' 2"" wife and 
I can easily find a good position for 
my 6' 2"" frame with plenty of head 
room.  The Mach audio system has good 
sound and the 6-disc changer in the 
console is a nice touch.  Heater/AC 
works great."

mercury,sable,2003,go blue, 02/03/2008,Safe 5 star & nice room,4,"Currently the vehicle has 100,000 miles.  Besides normal brakes, tires and oil changes, the only repair I had to make was a blower fan for $150.00.  I looked at the Honda Accord & Toyota Camry - both of those cars have timing belts and 30,000 mile tune ups. I had a 100% chance of spending $600 for the timing belt and $300 for each tune up X 3 since I have 100,000 miles.  That is a total of $1,500 in normal maintenance that I avoided with Ford's / Mercury's 100,000 mile tune up and a timing chain that lasts the life of the vehicle - serveral hundred thousand miles.  Why do you think Consumer Reports does not bring this up?  Ford delivers vehicle with the design to minimize maintenance costs!"

Ford Taurus 98 modell. Liked the Ford 
and Mercury Dealerships in our City. 
The promotion rebates in Summer 03 gave 
me the incentive to get another one 
from Ford after I checked out VWs 
(Passat, Jetta) and Volvos. Found them 
all to be too expensive and considered 
the Sable to be similar for a better 
price and even better value!"
mercury,sable,2003,mark, 09/29/2010,Winter beater,4,"I originally bought the car to drive in the winter to save my mustang from the winter climate of Wisconsin. The car has been very reliable and good on fuel (27 hwy). The only problem I have had with it was that a dealer did an oil change and didn't tighten the filter fully, oil leaked down onto the starter and caused the starter to malfunction.I have heard that the transmission is the weak link on these cars but so far has been shifting properly, I would recommend this car for a used car purchase"
mercury,sable,2003,Selfer, 03/30/2003,A good buy!,4,"We like this car a lot. It is our 3rd 
Mercury and 6th Ford product. It rides 
smoothly and has some nice extra 
touches. I find, with all Mercurys and 
too many cars these days, that the 
standard passenger seating is 
uncomfortable. I do not like to ride 
with my legs stretched out and the 
floors are too shallow to do otherwise. 
Bend your knees and they are up under 
your chin, it seems. Also, we drove the 
car out of the dealership and it 
shimmied. Seems it came from the 
factory with a bad caliper.  Is there 
no Quality Control anymore? But Mercury 
fixed it and the Sable rides well now."

Everything about the car was great, it was comfortable, great engine, and it was very safe. The only repair i had to make was a small brake fluid leak, which wasn't a big deal. Until, one day i was driving down the road, and the car just broke down on me without warning. It was the transmission, which i knew because the car revved, but didn't go anywhere. I took it to a mechanic, and they told me that the transmission was completely destroyed. They said it was going to cost $5000 to replace (i scrapped it obviously, thats double the price of the car), because my car had a ""limited edition"" transmission. Keep in mind that this happened with 62K on the odometer. Be wary with these cars, because the trans is its achilles heal.

This car would have been at the bottom of my list, but he insisted on checking it out. It had 135k, and looked kinda rough (nothing a good detailing couldn't solve). However the test drive, and a little research sold me. I've driven it quite frequently on long distance trips. The car is an absolute pleasure. It cruses like a Cadillac and I love the sound system and 6-disk changer. There are some obvious electrical problems, and little glitches with power options and I find the climate control confusing when driving. None the less it is a safe, sophisticated family car that I feel absolutely comfortable with my niece riding in. "

about this car, from the powerful 
Duratec V-6 engine, responsive 
handling, smooth braking system, ride 
quality, and such sound construction 
of vehicle.  I had previously test 
drove Altima and Toyota Solara prior 
to my purchasing this vehicle, and in 
my personal opinion, they couldn't 
stack up to what the 03 Sable LS had 
to offer. So I did the right thing, 
saved a few extra bucks and bought a 
far better car !"

the 2003 wagon easy to get used to and 
fun to drive. I found the small side 
mirrors hard to adjust to eliminate 
blind spots and the doors are low so I 
had to check for high curbs when 
getting out. Build quality could be 
better: I have to slam the hood hard to 
make it catch and the interior has 
fragile looking switches. The gauges 
are easy to read, even at night, though 
the headlamps are not very bright. The 
front bench center seat is about 11 
inches wide. Who can fit there? For the 
money, not a bad value."

Leather interior is beautiful, sunroof and climate control systems work perfectly. Installed new Goodyear triple Tread Tires, drives like a dream, very quiet with precise steering and ABS brakes. I cannot understand why american auto magazine reviewers give excellent U.S. made cars like my Sable such a bad rap. We rented a highly touted japanese car while on vacation and we found it to be slow, underpowered and tinny, with excessive road noise. We were glad to get rid of it at the end of the trip. Our Sable is a much better built car, quieter,with a more substantial structure,and much better power."

The doors close with a heavy clunk. Trunk space is great...we fit all our camping gear and still have room left over. The car now has 60k and still running strong (bought at 20k). Replaced front brakes at 40k and new battery but that is it. Love to take it on long trips. We drove cross- country in it in less than 3-days (NY to AZ) no problems driving virtually non-stop. We do the maintenance as required...change oil and just replaced cooling and transmission fluid. This is our third Sable/Taurus and the other 2 have served us well as well (over 100k each).

Also, once it gets to about a quarter tank of gas, the fuel pump shuts off. We had to push it over a mile to a gas station, I mean, what a stupid design failure. Overall, this car is not very impressive"
mercury,sable,2003,Eric, 09/14/2006,average car,3,"Bourght in late summer 03, had 7000 miles on it. This is not a bad car but I would not buy it again. Bought with extended warantee. Went back with paint peeling on front air vents. They said car was in a accident Repainted front bumper. They did not tell me this when I bourght car. Would not make good on warantee. Transmission had to be rebuilt at 35,000 miles. Had better cars."
mercury,sable,2003,chris1016, 10/30/2006,OOH- shiny!,4,"I bought the LS Premium with about 22k on it 6 mo. ago. AC compressor went bad after a couple months (luckily I had the extended warranty, but it still cost me a little over $100 deductible). Otherwise, car seems pretty solid. Somewhat luxurious (compared to the blander Taurus anyhow). But my LS came without a 6disc changer! Also, as others have said- the trunk, while of a decent size, is hindered by a too- small, oddly-shaped opening. And yeah, drum brakes? Shame on Ford for that one... Otherwise, I'm liking this car quite a bit."
mercury,sable,2003,Johny, 03/26/2003,Awesome,4,"I bought my 2002 Sable LS Premium in 
Dec 2002.  Opted for the Mach Audio 
system, with the 6 disk cd changer in 
the armrest, and spash guards. The car 
itself rocks.  It has a lot of power, 
does 0-50 in no time. Love the looks 
of it, and the cabin is quiet also. 
Gas mileage really sucks. I do about 
260 miles per tank the most in the 
city, and 320 miles per tank on the 
highway. For people who are thinking 
about buying it:  It's an OK car, 
except for: Bad gas mileage, water 
leaking in from under the driver's 
floormat (car always smells of mold 
because of that), engineering.  And 
last, it's nice and comfortable."
mercury,sable,2004,Go America, 05/14/2010,Still Going,4,"I have had my Sable for 5 years and now have 222,000 miles on it. This car still runs great with cold air. I have the 24 valve engine which I think is a lot better than the 3.0 Vulcan engine.I replace the AC compressor at 190,000 miles but other than the front wheel bearings and some basic maintance along with oil changes every 5,000 miles this car is great"
mercury,sable,2004,Mike Jacobs, 01/28/2016,Good Sable Stuff!,5,"I bought this car in 2007 with 21000 miles on the odometer. I was the third owner.  The car had been on a Red Carpet Lease and then sold as a certified car and those owners liked it so much they bought a new Sable.  I average around 20 MPG around town and after a 6000-mile trip, last summer averaged 27.5 MPG.  I have been very happy with this car.

A year has gone by and it's time for another 6000-mile road trip.  The oil has been changed, a new serpentine belt and 4 new tires and we're ready to go!  I should crack the 100K mark somewhere on the way back to Washington State.  A mile mark for a great car.

Well, in the past year I've slid into a  snowbank so there's a small dent on the front psgr door. Again, it's nearly time for the annual road trip with an extra stop this year in San Diego on the way to Memphis. I still have faith in the ""old girl"" and hope to have a good time. (o7/30/17)

1/31/18 My summer road trip was a success with no problems from my Sable LS Premium Package. I know it says GS In the description, but it's an LS.  The old girl is starting to show her age. My driver door lock mechanism has quit, so I have to lock/unlock ""the old fashioned way"".  I'm looking forward to my road trip this summer. A/C don't quit me now!

2/1/19 Another year and road trip have gone by with no major problems.  I had to replace the throttle position sensor which was a little spendy, but aside from that, the only other problem was with the sensor in the passenger front door alerting the ""door open"" warning. I had it removed so now I don't have that warning (big deal) nor does the dome light go on when the door is opened. I can live with that. This car appears to have a lot of life left and I'm glad, not only for the monetary aspect but because it's a very comfortable, well-performing car.

2/9/20  I didn't take my usual road trip last summer, so the odometer only clicked about 1000 times during the past year.  A few more little things are popping up on the ""usually or sometimes works"" list. The auto headlight sensor is getting a little touchy. Thankfully, when it's in the 'auto' position, the headlights come on when the car is started. That's OK with me since I don't have DRLs. The creature comforts like all the power equipment, A/C, stereo (including 6-CD changer), speed control and such all work seamlessly. This car was built in July 2004 so it's going to be 16 years old this summer. I'm a happy camper!
BTW, this is a 2004 Sable Premium LS, not a GS.

Its been absolutely problem free from day one. Only oil changes, 1 set of tires and 1 set of brake pads. It has really sold me on Ford products again. Currently looking for another program car just coming off lease. I saved a ton over new car cost and definitely got my money's worth. Next car will be an 08 Sable, probably another program car. You know old ladies drive em so they're not abused. Oh yeah, it seems like this 3.0 duratec gets better with age. The car feels like it has more power than it did at 20K which is how many miles it had when I bought it."

without fuss. The interior room and 
trunk volume are exceptional and 
unmatched by the foreign competition. 
The traction control takes a little 
getting used as compared to my two 
previous Sables without this feature, 
but  is   extremely effective on snow 
and ice.  Who needs a vehicle to haul 
around all those 4WD mechanicals all

The exterior design is beautiful and it is a classy looking car. The interior cabin is all leather and it is one of the most comfortable cars I have driven including those so- called luxury cars. The gas mileage could be better,(17mpg city,and 22mpg on the highway) Driving this car on the highway is like sitting in your living room in a very comfortable leather chair. You have very little feeling of motion and you do not feel the road at all.  The sound system is quite good and the A/C climate control is wonderful.  Set the interior temperature and relax in comfort. Great car!! 2005 is the last model yr."

This car is the most comfortable car I have owned including the Aviator and 2003 Mercedes C-320.  The seats have plenty room, a/c works extremely well even in New Orleans summer climate, mach sound system is very adequate.  Performance with Duratec V-6 is very responsive.  Gas mileage could be better, however, I am sure part of that goes along with different driving habits.  Trunk space is very good.  Style is good but lacks eye catching appeal, looks like many other mid size sedans.  For the money you can't get a better car, however, if you want to sell it you will take a beating as resale is poor."
mercury,sable,2004,Peter, 08/29/2007,Beautiful and practical station wagon,4,The medium red color and exterior look of this wagon elicit many second looks. It has been a very satisfactory car thus far.  I have had no problems with the car.  The large storage space in this relatively long wagon has been great for lugging purchases and for long trips.  Eight foot lumber items are no problem with the rear door closed.  All in all I am very satisfied.

They  stopped building Sables after the 05' model year, so not sure who this update's meant for, but what the hell...  As stated before, I still enjoy the basics of my Sable; smooth and well muted ride, plenty of interior space, lotsa bang-for-the-buck (power amenities, trip comp, solid safety credentials, etc.)...  Complaints are few, but focus on what could be described as ""classic automotive Americana;"" cheapo interior materials, the ominous threat of shakey long-term reliability (though, like the title says, so far so good!"

Thusly, I've nothing new to report. My car's all one would expect; roomy, smooth riding and dull as your kitchen blender.

To the former; a spacious and comfortable interior, smooth ride (whether city or highway), and myriad amenities for the buck.  To counter; (relatively) poor gas mileage (no more than 21 mpg overall), a dysfunctional starter ""repaired"" now twice in 11 months, and a generally unrefined feel throughout (poor interior fittings, rough idlying/revvving motor, random creaks, etc).

there are less Sable's on the road than

it is roomy inside with a spacious

dashboard is laid out well and easy to 
see.And I can't imagine not having the 
mileage counter that tells you how many 
more miles you can go before needing to 
stop for gas.
   
 The inside is comfortable and nicely 
done.For my money Ford offers the best 
paint job of any car maker and the 
paint and chrome make this Sable an eye 
catcher as you ride safely down the 
road.

can imagine my standards aren't too
high, but here goes...

Foremost, I appreciate this car's very
spacious interior. I'm over 6' tall, and
leg/elbow/shoulder room are not problems
here. 

American cars are know for their smooth
and quiet rides, and this Sable is no
exception, but moreover I appreciate
that the car is smooth without being
floaty or boaty - overall it makes for a
nice balance between ""traditional"" and
""contemporary."" 

Long-term durability worries me, but
we'll see; material/build quality
appears high; feature content is
certainly excellent!(Part II's a comin!)"
mercury,sable,2004,04'SableDriver, 02/23/2005,So Far So Good - Part II,4,"6,000 miles/3 months and so far so good!  My Sable continues to impress with its smooth ride, comfortable seats, and generally polished demeanor.  Truly this car speaks volumes as to why Americans buy millions of mid-size sedans each year - they really do just ""fit!"" Certainly not exciting, hardly sporty; but without a doubt, comfortable, quiet and eminently faithful in their daily motions.  Complaints in my case are few thus far. Gas mileage is hardly stellar (avg is about 20 or so mpg; all highway), and the standard stereo emits nothing but dull and flat noises.  Finally ""quality,"" that ever looming threat, has remained perfect - no glitches to report!  Stay tuned - Part III to come!"
mercury,sable,2004,William S, 07/06/2003,Great Car,4,"This is my first actual newer car.  It 
is a great car and i love the 
interior. Its very cozey in side and 
great on long rides for vacations. Im 
a person who likes to add accesories 
to a car and since ive been doing so 
the sable really has looked nice, and 
i get many complimants for it. I 
recommend it."
mercury,sable,2005,Vic, 02/24/2009,"Great, Solid Car",4,"My 2005 Mercury Sable is great! I got a fantastic car, and at a great price. Super value. It has an excellent ride, good performance, and handles great. Has 52,000 miles on it, only routine maintenance thus far (i.e. oil changes & wipers). Still has original tires and brakes! (Never has been in shop for repairs). It has great features for the money, is very comfortable for the family, and has large trunk space. I'm not sure I'll ever let it go. Highly recommend it if looking for a good, solid, used car."
mercury,sable,2005,Nick072261, 10/25/2009,Best kept secret out there at the time..,4,"I really love this car, especially now that I purchased better all season tires! I purchased this car with 19,000 miles for $12,000. It is completely loaded. I now have 45,000 miles on it and have not had any issues. It has a very strong v6 dohc engine that is fast on acceleration. The interior appointments look rich and classy. I also had a V6 Camry before this and I can truthfully say that for the price difference, the Sable is just as good - so far. I sold my Camry with 166,000 miles without any issues, hopefully the Sable will give me the same reliability, only time will tell.  "
mercury,sable,2005,edward gambardella, 06/13/2005,great car with lots of value.,4,"I am very pleased with the car. It has a great ride, seems solid ,and has good pick up. Why over pay for a Import."
mercury,sable,2005,Sean, 03/11/2007,Underpriced,4,"This is my 2nd sable; the first lasted over 12 years before it finally quit.  The 05 sable exceeded my expectations as far as interior design and build quality.  It kind of reminds me of a luxury car.  It may not have perfect gas mileage (I average around between 27-29 mpg), but other than that it definitely outclasses most of its competitors.  This car deserves a lot more credit.  "
mercury,sable,2005,Chet, 08/22/2010,Keeps tickin',4,"Extremely dependable, a great highway cruiser w/mpg average 23-25. This is my 4th Sable and will easily last over 200,000 miles in my experience. Weakest link is the transmission. However, if you change fluids on time, tell her you love her once a week- she will love you back. Very high rating on dependability and safety. This is not your dad's Sable. "
mercury,sable,2005,Jane, 11/08/2005,okay but never again,2,The car is okay.  It has the most features for the price and the dealer has been more than helpful.  My car's engine light is on about once every two months.  It chuggs along.  No comfortable for trips over 170 miles.  Not the ideal car to rack miles on and expect minimal maitenance.  Does handle well in the snow but not the cold.
mercury,sable,2005,Gina, 06/28/2005,I love my 2004 Sable Wagon,5,"I shopped for a while before selecting this car for the second time, and I'm glad I did. You heard me right, this car has significant improvements over my previous 97 Taurus Wagon which I also loved to drive. I've driven my 2004 Sable for 14,000 miles so far and haven't had a single problem with it, so yes I'm quite happy. For me, considering what you get, the price of this car made it a no-brainer. I probably would be interested in a Jaguar or a Volvo Wagon too, but only if I didn't have to pay all that extra money. I also think that the Sable is a great looking car, inside and out."
mercury,sable,2005,Ted ZAmbricki, 07/10/2005,"best auto ever owned,",5,"never had a problem with the Sable. it starts very good, the air conditioner is excellent, it cools instantly, the heater likewise it heats instantly, The pick up is excellent, the price is great I purchased the best model so it goes to show that you get what you pay for. I would purchase a Mercury or Mazda as my next new auto. I like the Mercury van that is made by Mazda, I had one for 2 years and got spoiled. I will purchase my next auto in 2006 which will be as I had stated."
mercury,sable,2005,GLK, 12/11/2005,My wife loves it,4,"I'm not quite sure why Mercury is forced to sell these cars with such a high discount. The LS I bought listed a bit over $26,000 and I picked it up for $15,900. On occasion I drive it and find it to be a very nice car. As a family car it's just fine; as a second car it is superior. We've had no problems with it whatsoever nor did we have to take it in for those annoying little repairs that were not caught at the factory. Is it dated in style and ammenities? Perhaps, but it has exactly what my wife needs and then some. It is easy to drive, quiet, and has enough pickup to get around a slower driver. Instrumentation is well- thought out and I'm most happy with the value I got for my money."
mercury,sable,2005,GCB, 01/20/2006,Get One Quick,5,"This car is fabulous! You could call it a sleeper. Sable is not well known by most people looking for a car in this class, but it sure beats all the imports. It has everything, looks, size, comfort, performance, price and quality. Ford has had alot of time to get the bugs out and refine this vehicle to where it is as near to perfect as you can get. Of course, then it has to be discontinued because it has been around too long and the name or the style isn't ""cool"" to some. I think it was way ahead of its time when it was first designed and is still a very nice looking, safe, comfortable and functional car. Better find one fast. Not many 2005's left. Don't get a ""me to"" import. Be different."
mercury,sable,2005,Michael Momberg, 01/22/2006,Michael Momberg,4,This vehicle is what I was searching for. It has all the options I wanted and the price was most affordable. I would recommend Mercury to others.  An overall good American car.  
mercury,sable,2005,E.A. Gunter, 08/25/2005,Great car,4,I actually have a 2003 but I realy enjoy this car.  I recent moved and you would not believe how mucg it cargo it can hold. I drove it 750 miles filled to the brim with cargo and the ride was just as smooth as when it's empty and the gas milage was not bad either.
mercury,sable,2005,Marie Tedeschi, 08/24/2005,Its my 4th Sable - Enough Said?,4,"I love my Sable.  It is the fourth one that I have leased and I would not hesitate to lease it again at lease end. It gives me everything I want and more. It is high on performance, looks good and not bad on economy.  I can't say enough about the comfort I have in using the Sable.  I love it, love it, love it.

mercury,sable,2005,peter, 12/19/2007,New big ride,4,"Just having my accident a few weeks before, was looking and not buying but going to a 2004 Nissan Sentra to a bigger car was adjustment. Driving and sitting in the Sable was different than Sentra. Going from 15,900 to 13,900 and 15480 miles on it was a good deal. The leather seating and wood console was class and all around controls were easily on reach. The trunk was huge to me and its a smooth ride "
mercury,sable,2005,Myrtle , 04/13/2005,Buy a Mercury Sable,4,It has a very quiet and smooth ride and it has very comfortable seats and it has very good crash test scores and it has a huge trunk .
mercury,sable,2005,Craig, 07/07/2005,Great Family Car,4,"I just bought this car a couple of days ago.  The sticker price was over $27,000.  With incentives, the purchase price was $16,999.  This is one of the best values anywhere.  This car is over $2,000 less than a Honda Accord (which I was getting rid of)or a Toyota Camry and has many more options than those cars. This car has leather, a power sunroof, climate control, power everything, heated mirrors and more.  The fit and finish both inside and out is good. There is plenty of room for 5 adults. The V6 gets good milage and has plenty of power.  The tranny is smooth and the ride is comfortable.  We have an '03 Mercury Mountaineer and have not had any problems with the Mercury brand."

mercury,sable,2005,Soli, 06/14/2004,Great car,5,"Had a 1996 Mercury Sable with the 
Vulcan engine and liked the car.  Had 
no trouble with it for over 100,000 
miles.  Traded for a 2003 Mercury 
Sable with the Duratech multi-valve 
200 HP engine (son not on insurance 
anymore), and love the additional 
power. Leather seats and all the bells 
and whistles.  Great car and fun to 
drive.  Have had 0 problems with it. 
Would recommend highly for a family 
sedan.  Camry too spartan inside and 
much more money. Avalon compares 
favoribly but much much more 
expensive. A definite best buy."
mercury,sable,2005,a. cOLARUSSO, 09/04/2004,My Comments,4,"Very pleased with the all around 
performance. A great ride for a mid 
size car !"
mercury,sable,2005,Mercuryluva, 09/14/2004,Good Ol' Mercury,4,"I recently had a 93' sable and had no 
problems up to 130,000 miles. I now 
have the bigger V6 with 200hp and love 
it. It has plenty of around town pep. 
Very roomy inside but didn't opt for 
the leather because of kids. I would 
highly recommend a sable over a camery 
because you get more for your money, 
more room, more exctitng driving 
experience."
mercury,sable,2005,Rickey, 11/12/2006,Nice car,4,"Vehicle is very comfortable. I feel that I got a lot of car for the money. The insurance premium is very reasonable. I really like the trim on this vehicle, it doesn't appear cheap."
mercury,sable,2008,Randall, 10/04/2009,Traded up,4,"I was originally drawn to the sable because of its exterior looks. I wanted good gas mileage without sacrificing enough power to be able to enter busy freeways or pass on a two lane highway with safety. So far we have taken it on two long trips. The ride was smooth and we made good time plus we didnt spend that much on gas. The gas gauge stays on full for an incredibly long time. My wife loves the little analog clock with the purple glow. She says it relaxes her while driving. The sound system is good. We love the style of the seats and interior. We had negative equity on our trade in, so we decided to trade up for a car that would still be good after we finished paying for it."
mercury,sable,2008,RON TURNER, 02/09/2009,Precertified 08 Sable,4,"I own a 2008 Ford Expedition EL, although I love the vehicle it's extremely harsh on gas. I'm averaging 10 mpg. Mostly I do alot of in town driving, so I decided to pickup something more fuel efficient and not drive my Expedition as much. I purchased a precertified 2008 Mercury Sable with about 14,000 miles. I've had it for a little over a month. I love the car. It's spacious on the inside and my three kids ages 15, 12 & 5 have plenty of room in the back seat.The car came out of the rental fleet and I'm dealing with an alignment issue, but other than that I'm pleased with the car. I like it so well that I'm already thinking 3 to 4 years down the road taking a serious look at the new Taurus "
mercury,sable,2008,Mike Hager, 07/10/2018,Love this Mercury Sable,5,"We get great mileage and an excellent ride with our Sable. Although we did have to have the AC system replaced in 2017 but come on we live in South Florida and it's used almost all the time. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone. As I said we love it. And yes it has pretty much everything power (seats, windows, mirrors and so on). And it has lots of luggage space, back seats even fold down for more space.
"
mercury,sable,2008,Fred, 06/03/2016,Happy camper,5,"Can't believe that they don't make this car anymore. Quiet, huge interior - trunk, decent gas mileage, safe  ...... what more can you ask for ? Newer Taurus is has much less interior room and trunk space. Find one, buy it !
"
mercury,sable,2008,billyd425, 04/20/2012,Used 2008 Sable Premier AWD,4,This car had 49K when I bought it last August. Put about 15K on it so far. Drives & handles well. Wish the drivers seat floor didn't have the mound on the left side and the floor was a bit wider. Console is in an awkward position to retrieve change or plug a device into the USB Port. EVERYone who had rode in this car has nothing but compliments about it. Getting about 400 miles to a tankful (19 Gallons) with most of my driving being city while trying to get to the highway. Plenty of room in the back seat. Quiet at 80mph on the highway. 
mercury,sable,2008,Jim Casterton, 01/17/2009,Better Than Cadillac,4,"My last car was a very nice Cadillac STS, but I honestly like the Sable a lot better.  I have owned my '08 Sable for just over a year and have 41,000 miles. I've had no trouble whatsoever.  It has a much roomier interior than my Cadillac. The platform seems higher than most cars so it's easier to get into and out of and visibility is great while driving. The hands free phone through Synch is great. I think it's a better car than the Cadillac -- at about half the price. I highly recommend it! "
mercury,sable,2008,Utahguy, 06/04/2010,Great Ride!,4,"40K mi; had since new.  Have had LOTS of vehicles over the last 40 yrs, and this is truly an outstanding sedan value-wise.  BIG interior, HUGE trunk, in nice-sized, ""Euro-style"" car.  NO complaints, other than mileage does suffer some from AWD.  Around 17 city/22 hwy @ 80mph."
mercury,sable,2008,KJN, 08/04/2010,Comfortable and worry free driving,4,"I've now had my Sable for 2 1/2 years and 50,000+ miles with not a single problem. I'm amazed and saddened that they've discontinued building it, but I guess that's the way of the world. It's not flashy, just a good quality automobile with plenty of room and so comfortable to drive.  The Sync system is very convenient and the all wheel drive and heated seats make our brutal Chicago winters bearable.  I'll keep this car as long as I can and then go back for whatever Ford/ Lincoln-Mercury offers in it's place.  This car spells Q-U-A-L-I-T-Y and reliability at an affordable price.  "

mercury,sable,2008,Paul, 05/14/2017,My sweet Merc has let me down.,3,"It is still very comfortable and fun to drive especially on Hwy trips. I have experienced extensive repairs to the engine, computer and now the 6 speed automatic transmission. I still enjoy the car but with the thousands of dollars in repairs I considered junking this sweet car before it reached its 50,000 mile birthday! I will have a tough time agreeing to a Ford Motor CO’s product. My girlfriends 2008 Malibu has had almost no repairs in its first 100,014 miles. That’s right an American car!

mercury,sable,2008,Dan fein, 02/16/2016,Probably never buy a Mercury again,2,"Had to replace transmission  car only has 50,000 miles on it, heated seat elements on both sides not working, transmission slips into gear doesn't shift fast. Not very impressed

mercury,sable,2008,LovedmyMercurysable, 09/20/2016,My favorite car but then this happened...,2,"I loved my car. I bought it used about 5 years ago. I drove it and loved it. Did regular oil changes and made sure to take car of this car. Right after owning this car for 5 years I was on my way to work. When I got about half way to work the RPM's went all over the place. The car started Jerking like crazy. The car would not go above 50 which meant that I could not even do the speed limit. The car was loud. It was horrible. I managed to get it to the parking lot of my work place. I then had this car towed to my mechanic and turns out that It needs a whole transmission. I'm really sad about this because I loved this car and now I have to say good bye to my car. Car shopping time:/
"
mercury,sable,2008,harleyguy2, 01/29/2012,"Nice car if not for all the faulty ""Bells and Wistles"".",3,"For the most part the car can well and drove nice.
The interior and exterior quality was good.
However, the Memory Seats, Power Seats, Heated Seats and Heat and A/C controls were problems from the very start.

Each were repaired multiple times under the warranty.
After the warranty expired problems with power seats and A/C occurred again.
Ford would not peform the repairs under the 12 month 12,000 mile warranty as they said the parts that failed were not the same as the parts repaired the previous year, even though the symptoms of the problem were identical.
Finally traded it in on a Foreign car.
Can't afford a Ford."
mercury,sable,2008,2141marine, 06/14/2013,Outstanding ar first,3,"This is our second Sable, the first was a 1997, and fourth Ford product. As time goes by it seems the quality does not get better. My 1997 Sable was a better vehicle than the 08. At first it was a smooth operating vehicle, after about 20k it developed transmission problem. The Radio/CD player broke and the suspension started to go. Now it is in the shop for an unknown problem, every light on the dash came on , its like the car put itself in safe mode. Don't get me wrong, this is a good vehicle with plenty of room, a strong AC and decent mileage on the highway. Test drive before you drive, after a while it will sound like a lawnmower inside and the transmission will shift hard. "
mercury,sable,2008,rick, 10/15/2010,Best car I ever had,4,"This car rocks.  Very classy, great sound system and the sync is awesome for anyone who lives by a pda.  I get compliments everywhere I go.  Folks think it is German quite often.  Then they see Sable and go ""WOW"".  I get 28 mpg at 68mph around 19 in town carrying as as much gear as folks pack in their SUV.  I cant understand why they quit making it.  I only wish it had a manual shift tranny like the LS I traded in.  It does have a a high profile and looks kind of funky from directly behind but not as much as say a Volvo or a SAAB.   Previous cars: Lincoln LS, BMW 535, VW Passat, Grand Cherokee Limited."

There is plenty of room for relatives, who my wife and I drive around fairly often. While the fuel economy may not be great to some, it is much better than my previous two vehicles, an Explorer and a Grand Voyager, and a great deal better than the most comfortable new car I ever bought, a 1972 Buick Electra 225. "
mercury,sable,2008,cthelightnh, 08/27/2008,A Great American Sedan,4,We have had the Sable for 6 months and have found it to be a very good sedan. Plenty of room with very comfortable seats. It comes with the features you would expect in an American Sedan.  It has enough power to cruise smoothly and quietly down the highway. 6 speed tranny gives it extra zip when you need it. Great sightlines so it is easy to drive around town too. The Sable is easy to park. It is reasonably quiet and has a very good ride. It came off the lot with no initial quality defects which is 1st for me. It developed noise in front end later but was addressed in a Service Bulletin under warranty.  Averaging around 22 mixed MPG. I would recommend to anyone wanting a large family sedan.
mercury,sable,2008,Danis Klatt, 11/11/2008,Wonderful car!,5,"I've only had the car for a few months and it's wonderful! I can't find anything bad to say about this car. I wish I would have bought a Mercury sooner. It rides smooth, it's a beautiful car, and it has Cadillacs beat all to heck. I strongly suggest that if anyone wants to buy a midsize luxury car this is the one they should consider strongly. I drove a rental which was a Sable two days prior to buying mine and that's what made me decide to purchase one. I can't get over the incredible gas mileage I get on this car. It's unbelievable. I can't say enough good things about this car. "
mercury,sable,2008,TH, 12/10/2008,"Great car, make sure you look at it",4,I don't see many of them around but it is a great car. Give it a look if your in the market. You won't be disappointed. The biggest safety risk you take every day is getting behind the wheel. Feel good about the excellent safety features of this car. 
mercury,sable,2008,teach2, 02/25/2009,3rd One!,4,"This is my third Sable. I was so hoping to fall in love with another car so I could venture away from the same car-again. For price, comfort and amenities-there is no other car to love.  I test drove the MKZ but the Sable has as many creature comforts but with a larger interior, same mileage.  Time will tell if it's as reliable as my other two-both exceeded 150,000 miles."
mercury,sable,2008,Careful Shopper, 05/08/2009,Sensible car buyer,5,"Very pleased with my base model Sable..However the auto I purchased did come with the interior convenience package, Sat. radio, mud flaps, and electric front seats.   Very, very quiet, handle well,  and rides great.. The transmission is very smooth and the engine is impressive.  The fit and finish is extremely good.  I feel it was the best car for the money in my price range.  I also considered the Avalon, Fusion, Milan, and Tarus.  I've had a lot of experience with the Tarus (Sable's twin) with my job and have never had any problems with it.  One had over 135000 miles on it.  The last time I checked milage was 30.5 with well over half of those miles in city driving."

mercury,sable,2008,RCS, 05/20/2009,Great Car,5,"Bought new for my wife because of the seat height. Drove to Memphis, TN for vacation and averaged 36.3 mpg for the trip, a total of 1875 miles. Plenty of room and large trunk. Like the styling of the Sable better than the Taurus and interior is more upgraded. Ride is great, almost as smooth as the Crown Vic I had. Recomend car very highly."
mercury,sable,2008,Chuck, 05/21/2009,Love my Mercury,4,"Brought my car as a Program Car with 18,000 miles. Have since put on 6,000 miles which includes one long trip to Phoenix and return to SD. We're Snowbirds,and we don't travel lightly as my wife seems to move things from one closet to another. Trunk space is huge and with both back seats folded flat we load it with banana boxes, garment bags and etc.. When we get loaded, we're heavy. Never the less at the end of the trip our information center said we averaged 29.8 MPG. Driving at interstate speeds,that's good. The ride is great, comfortable  and quiet. I really love this car, the best one yet, and yes, Fords got it right on this one."

Howevwer the 2008 is far more comfortable and luxurious than the 2005 I replaced.  High seating, great visibility, huge back seat and trunk make this a perfect family car.  I also own a Lincoln Town Car, but the Sable is the preferred car for trips. Build quality is excellent.  I would highly recommend the car to anyone of any age.  You will not be sorry if you buy one."
mercury,sable,2008,JD, 12/23/2009,2008 Sable is a great car,4,"I have 17,000 on my '08 Sable, I purchased it new in Feb. 2009 and it has been trouble free.  Only warranty service was to align one of the back doors better; if it was not for that my build quality rating would be 10.  I wanted a big and smooth car and this one has delivered.  It is a big, tall car with easy access to front and rear seating.  Performance rating of 9 takes it for what it is, a big smooth car, not a sports car.  If you are looking for a used family car this is a great choice. "

mercury,sable,2008,Nick , 05/20/2007,Mercury Sable Better Than Ever!,4,"My 2008 Mercury Sable is fantastic. I could not be happier with it. It handles great. The ride quality is superb, quiet and smooth. I have plenty of head and legroom as well as a great view of the road. The interior quality is superb. The fit and finish of the exterior is very nice. It's very tight. I love the exterior design. The front design is very sleek and I like the clear ailamp covers. The performance of the 3.5L V6 is great. It moves this heavy sedan with no problems and the 6-speed shifts smoothly. And I love the beautiful exterior color. Dark Ink Blue looks awesome and the black leather with white stitching is first class. I am very happy with my new Sable. I suggest you go check one out. It's really good to see that Mercury has finally got a lineup that will get young buyers in to the showrooms myself in included. 10 Years ago I never would have thought i would own a Mercury at 27 Years old."
mercury,sable,2008,golfguy, 10/18/2007,A Ford Man Always,4,"Have 1,500 miles and love the car.  Seem to get great highway mileage but city seems very low. Very comfortable seating and feel better than my old town car. Love all the light around the car when you open the doors. 7,500 service intervals is also appealing So far we love it.  Door clicker on the key could use a ""raised"" spot or ""dimple"" to locate the Open button in the dark. Hard to feel the buttons. Difficult to find slot for key without bending around the steering column to actually look."
mercury,sable,2008,3xaladyky, 07/06/2020,Sits like SUV - Comfortable - Peppy,5,"I bought this car new because of the taller seats which sit more like an SUV or F150 pickup truck. Easy to get in and out of & greater road visibility. Has given me good service, gets 23 or 24 MPG on curvy hilly roads and get better than that on straight roads. Love the stick selector for hi beam or low beam headlights, push forward for hi beam & pull back for lo beam. Love large trunk & seats fold if needing to haul longer items. Peppy enough to pass cars quickly.

mercury,sable,2008,Miche, 06/06/2010,Lots of problems,3, Axle gasket has been replaced twice and is going in for a 3rd time to get fixed due to leaking again!  Car stalls while it is in motion when air conditioner is on. It also stalls while idling.  I will be driving and the car just shuts down on its own.  Mercury dealership says there is nothing wrong with it. I bet they change their minds when I go off the road due to no power of any kind when it stalls.  Seat warmer has a burning smell when it is on for more that 5 minutes.  Not happy!
mercury,sable,2008,A Ford Man Always, 08/12/2010,Why quit building a winner?,5,"I've owned it 3 years with 60K on it and without question, the very best car I've ever owned. Only problem to occur was seat heater broke and was fixed under warranty. I'm 72 years old and have owned many cars and have driven 2-3 million miles and this car is the MOST COMFORTABLE car I've ever sat it. The higher seats make it so easy to get in and out. I've just wwore out the OEM Pirelli tires and have replaced them with new Hankook Optimo's which are like floating on air. Why would Ford stop making such a grand car? My opinion seems to be shared with 96% of those here responding. What gives? Of course the new Taurus is indeed a pretty good alternative."
mercury,sable,2008,Drake2000, 09/25/2010,Started off good,3,"When we first bought the Sable (used July 09) we really loved it overall, big comfortable, good engine, power. But over the last year we have had in the shop 4 times for non-mechanical/non- engine failures, such as the truck hydraulics broke and it almost fell on my wife's head. Left steering linkage went bad and you could barely turn the car left while driving. The heated seat (driver's side) went out. Now currently some kind of air flow actuator motor (what directs the air flow from a/c) went bad. Not to mention the door trim molding (black rubber seal) has came loose twice and the 3 preset button of the radio is severly sticking. These are all annoying pesky things going wrong-not happy all"
mercury,sable,2008,Ralph, 11/10/2010,Not overly happy,3,"I had many Fords but this is my first bran new car and I guess I expected more. Has about 30,000 miles. Had to replace drivers side seat heater element, new instrument cluster due to burnt out bulb ( bulbs are not replaceable), drivers door seal not staying in place, erratic shifting between first and second gear and erratic idle. The best MPH I have had is 21 on a trip, average is 17-19. The car is comfortable I just do feel the quality is there. "
mercury,sable,2008,Disappointed, 08/04/2010,Rolling on incline,2,"This car rolls on an incline when in gear. Need to use both break and gas to keep car from rolling on incline ( if in drive will roll backwards gain speed quickly, same occurs in revers if on downward incline). Ford has requested I take it to 6 different dealerships for repair. All of the dealership say they cannot duplicate the roll. I live in the mountains and this a huge problem I have nearly rolled into several cars/objects because of the rolling. It seems the dealership have their mind made up that there is not a problem before they test the car. The first time the car was serviced for this issue was at 1K miles."
mercury,sable,2008,jwdantq, 04/02/2010,not great,2,"Needed brakes at 41k, door moldings are held on by double sticky back tape, car never has gotten gas mileage that was suggested by sticker, car is very noisy, would not buy another one. Have owned Ford products for over 20 years and I am going to switch to Japanese or Korean, maybe even German."
mercury,sable,2008,LAWNGUYLANDER, 11/13/2010,A lot better than you think,4,"What's not to love about this car? Performance is great from the 260 hp v6. Acceleration/passing is quick. Ride quality is a perfect balance of not too tight/too soft. The car's exterior styling has a ""high-end"" German look about it. The cabin looks/feels luxurious with the wood accents and two-toned leather seats/door panels. The seats are exceptionally comfortable with the heated, and power recline options. The options include dual hvac, power adjustable pedals, power moonroof, memory seats, traction control. The sound system is awesome, powerful, clear, with a bass Punch that makes your ears hurt on vol =4. The trunk is massive, we got a hand truck, 15 gallons of paint and still had room."

mercury,sable,2008,Merlin, 06/26/2008,Update,3,"Purchased the car ll/07 and immediately fell in love with it. However, after a few months and several thousand miles some chinks have appeared in its armor. Gas mileage is awful. 20 mpg in mixed driving and 24/25 freeway driving. Computer consistently shows 4 mpg more than car is actually getting. Also, car has developed an annoying noise in the front suspension that is worsening with time. Haven't had a chance to get it back to dealer yet."
mercury,sable,2008,awhsum1, 09/27/2008,Hidden Gem,4,"I have been very impressed with my Sable. I have had it for 5 months, with approximately 7,500 miles. Very comfortable interior, great ride, and very responsive for a sedan. My Sable is the base model with reverse sensors and leather. The leather seat are very comfortable, even on long trips. Mercury has a hit with the new Sable. At 6'2, plenty of headroom and legroom,in the front and back, spacious trunk. I had compared the Taurus with the Sable, since they are the same, but the Sable had a smoother ride and better suspension for only a couple hundred more. If you are in the market for a sedan, test drive the Sable, you will be pleasantly surprised! Avg MPG 22 city 27 hwy"
mercury,sable,2008,john, 08/04/2009,Complaint,4,"Only complaint is the style,especially the back.Should be more stylish like a Camry, and accord. Not as smooth riding as my 2003 and 1998 Gran Prei. Especially on bumps. This is an honest review. Other than that I like the car roomy.Great trunk. I still haven't got my 18 mi. to gallon locally?"
mercury,sable,2008,Jeff, 04/08/2010,Decent car,3,"I leased this vehicle for 2 years & put 36,000 miles on it. The only problem I had was leaking ATF lines. Was fixed under warranty, but the dealer kept the car for a WEEK to replace some rubber hoses! Whether the cause was a bad design or improper installation doesn't matter to me, it reflects poorly on Ford. Other than that I only have a few nit-picks. The ride IMO was stiff. It sort of bounced over bumps, didn't absorb them. The AM/FM button was too small. The seats were too hard. The transmission could be quite clunky in shifting from 1st to 2nd (esp. when cold), otherwise it was downright buttery shifting. The engine was smooth, quiet & powerful enough for me."
mercury,sable,2008,jlat, 05/14/2010,Nice Car,4,"I have owned this car for almost 2 years and have no issues. I have 38k miles so far. The engine has great performance. I usually average about 22 MPG city\hwy. I can get 30 mpg on long trips with a car load of kids,dogs, and suitcases. The car is very quiet and drives like a large American sedan should. I would by another if given the choice. No squeaks rattles or other noises. "
mercury,sable,2008,keithm, 06/08/2008,Mercury doing a good job,4,"Just traded an '06 Milan premier for an '08 Sable Premier AWD. Color is ""Light Sage"" (more resembles a pearlescent silver)Car has everything except Reat Seat Entertainment/Rear Window Shade. My partner, who thought I was nuts for trading so soon loves the Sirius Sat.radio/Nav.system. Overall car is more luxurious & more powerful than Milan. If '09 Milan gets 3.5 V6 things will change. Tested Lincoln MKZ with 3.5. Smaller car means faster car. Wanted more room (Milan is still pretty roomy) Overall an outstanding car."
mercury,sable,2008,Regs, 06/11/2008,Excellent Car!,5,"This is a large car, the fuel economy is excellent for a car of this size. Considered Toyota and Honda, but this one has better design and much better price. Very quiet, good view, huge trunk."
mercury,sable,2008,JC, 06/16/2008,2008 Sable Premier FWD,4,I was looking for a large car that could offer some comfort on road trips as well as decent highway mileage. I found it in the Mercury Sable. It also offered a large trunk with fold down seats giving the flexibility to carry sports equipment. So far there have been no problems and the car gives me everything I needed.  I'm looking forward to driving it for several years. The options and standard equipment offer a lot of features and value for the price. 
mercury,sable,2008,keithm, 06/14/2008,Great car,4,"I just traded an '06 Milan for an '08 Sable. The nav system/Sirius radio are great. This car came with every option except rear seat entertainment system. Car is very quiet & surprisingly quick. You're well over the speed limit if not careful. Interior is very nice with supportive seats. Always dislike cars with seats that are ""too"" cushy."
mercury,sable,2008,Chris , 12/17/2007,Proud Mercury Owner,5,"I traded in a 2005 Cadillac SRX fully loaded for a 2008 Mercury Sable Premier AWD fully loaded with satellite radio, navigation, rear DVD and bluetooth sync. I am extremely pleased with this vehicle. It rides better and is quieter than the Cadillac I previously drove. It has one of the largest trunks available in a sedan at over 21 cubic feet. I paid $34,500 with all these features...at least $15,000 lower than if I had bought another Cadillac. The Cadillac had poor quality. This vehicle seems to be built solid. It is every bit as luxurious as any other $50,000+ vehicle when fully loaded. You gotta Check it out!"
mercury,sable,2008,Regs, 07/09/2008,It's a good car!,4,"Very solid quality, good size, huge trunk. Two-tone leather command seats are very comfortable, nice view in all directions, back-off sensors work well.  Good sound system.  For the size, fuel economy is not bad. Hope Ford can bring the GDI 4-cylinder engine soon."
mercury,sable,2008,kjnewman, 12/25/2007,Fantastic Car,5,"I wanted to move up to an import luxury car and spent time looking at Lexus, Acura and Audi first. My last stop was the Lincoln-Mercury dealer. I drove the MKZ and then the salesman suggested I try the new Sable. I was reluctant but figured since I was there anyway I might as well try it. What a car! $20,000-40,000 less than the imports with all the bells and whistles.  I was so shocked I had to go back 3 times to make sure. This car is a steal! The Sync system is terrific and the car is so damn comfortable I can hardly believe it. Ford has a winner here that appears to have been overlooked by the media and auto pundits.  "
mercury,sable,2008,company car, 12/31/2007,Outstanding Car,4,"I have owned the AWD Sable Premier for two months and absolutely love it.  If you are looking for a sport sedan - look elsewhere, but if you are looking for a great ride, high safety, and a great value - buy this car. The AWD system is great for snow and ice.  Passenger comfort is exceptional - More room in the back seat than the 300.  For both city and highway driving, we have averaged 20 mpg.    "
mercury,sable,2008,pete, 01/05/2008,A Great Car,4,"My 2007 Motego was a very good car. The Sable is even better. Better ride, much better performance. I've driven it 4,500 miles in all kinds of conditions including mountain driving. It performed very well under all conditions. Highway mileage equals or exceeds 28MPG and around town ranges from 17 to 20MPG.  The first 1,000 miles I did experience a little delay in downshifting but now it does fine. I would definitely recommend this car to all types of drivers.  It's quick enough, has an excellent ride and is quiet.  What more can you ask for?"
mercury,sable,2008,Merlin, 01/20/2008,08 Sable,4,"Traded a Honda Accord 06, EX-L, for this 08 Mercury Sable.  So far I'm extremely pleased with this car. I gave up nothing in terms of build quality and find it much more comfortable than the Honda. Would certainly recommend it to those looking for superior car at a reasonable price."
mercury,sable,2008,dmers1, 01/29/2008,Great Value for the Money,4,"Power is quite good for a V-6,  260 HP and it shifts very smooth with the 6 speed Automatic. The oil filter is located in a pretty good spot and I use my drive up ramps using 5W-20 oil every 7500 miles. I changed at 2500 the first time to get factory grit out of the engine as I tend to keep cars quite a long time. This car starts every time and never misses no matter what temperature__4-8 degree mornings for us.  The only problem, I had was an out of adjustment cruise control switch on the brake pedal that would kick out the cruise occasionally. I took it to a nearby Ford dealer for a quick fix and that was it. I did buy the extended 6 year/100K mile warranty since I still remember the $1800"
mercury,sable,2008,JS, 02/03/2008,Great Vehicle !,4,"10 days & 500 miles. Sticker is $32K, got $2k off from the dealer and $2k factory rebate. I am pleased & impressed. This is a lot of automobile for $28K. I can't believe Ford is not advertising this vehicle. Fit & finish is on par with any Honda or Toyota. While not a Vette or Lincoln Town Car, this is a powerful, smooth, comfortable, roomy & quite vehicle. Huge back seat and huge trunk, not to mention with the trunk passtru & passenger front seat down, you can carry 9 foot items ! SYNC with my Verizon LG cellphone & Apple iPod is fantastic! While gas mileage is not exactly outstanding, one must remember that this is a large (safe) vehicle with AWD."

mercury,sable,2008,Colorado Sable, 02/26/2008,This is a Ford?,4,"Needed AWD sedan. Looked at Audi, Benz, BMW, Lexus, Subaru. Test drove 08 Sable and was floored. Quiet, comfortable, good power and 6 speed tranny. Can be picked up for little over invoice. Gas mileage on par with other >250hp v6 large sedans, do the research. AWD is super. 80% of the luxo's at 1/3 the cost. 5000 miles and not a single issue. Below 60 turn off overdrive and car is much more responsive around town and MPG stays the same."
mercury,sable,2008,JFS, 09/04/2007,Waited for 2008 and Glad,4,"Almost bot 2005 Montego but backed out at the last minute. Was nervous over engine and quirky CVT. '08 offer sufficent power, smooth 6 spd trany. All other features - space, ride, safety, still there. USA Today auto editor said that front end bounces too much over sharp bumps. I can't find this at all. Some have said that 6 spd trans too slow to downshift and ""hunts"" too much for right gear. I disagree again. Exterior design may not be a medal winner but certainly not ugly. Is some tire noise w/ 18"" Pirelli's but no where near a deal breaker. A very underated car."
mercury,sable,2008,CommuterMan, 07/10/2007,We have a winner!,4,"I bought my Sable two weeks ago and I have to say that Mercury has hit a home run with this one!  They've addressed all of the weaknesses of the Montego: styling, power, wind noise, and lack of ESC. I love the looks of the new Sable, which must be seen in person to appreciate. I didn't care for the front of the Montego, it looked sort of buck-toothed. The Sable on the other hand, looks hungry.  Up close it looks like a cross between the Milan and the Chrysler 300. The Sable has a much beefier engine now and it corners nicely. You just point and go - effortlessly, with plenty of power to spare. The 2008 Sable looks bigger than the old, but is only 2 in. longer. "
mercury,sable,2008,Wynn, 07/21/2007,A lot of car for the money!,5,I bought my Sable on July 7 and continue to be amazed at the performance and features. The transmission is silky smooth and seems designed for highway mileage. Front passenger's door unlocks with pull of the handle again--terrific! Vehicle is so quiet the Pirelli tire noise is noticable on some pavement. Performance of the new headlights is great.
mercury,sable,2008,Ronald, 08/02/2007,A great car,4,"I have owned the  vehicle for a little over a month and driven it over 3000 miles.  The car runs great, has plenty of power, handles good and has lots of room. It is a very good car.  "
mercury,sable,2008,Cletis Pride, 08/21/2007,Premier AWD,4,"Smooth, safe, attractive, driver- friendly, very roomy, quiet. Could stand a few more mpg."
mercury,sable,2008,Mark, 10/03/2007,Great Value,4,"I went from a Chrysler 300M to this car and I'm so glad I did. It is a great value. It is the roomiest car in it's class. I am 6'4 and can sit comfortably in the back seat with the drivers seat all the way back. However I was slightly disappointed in the foot well space on the drivers side. Also, being tall, my head is pretty close to the roof of the car with the moonroof option. The engine is quiet and has great acceleration when you need it. You may be disappointed in the gas mileage though if you don't do a lot of highway driving. 75% of my miles are highway miles and I still only average about 23.5 MPG. The only real negative I have is the instrumentation. Pretty basic."
mercury,sable,2008,Aaron, 07/16/2007,Best Family Sedan Ever.,5,The new 2008 Mercury Sable is great it has all the features you could ever want at a price you can afford. The new Sable's 3.5L V6 has plenty of horsepower to move the car without any problems and the engine is good on gas so far on highway driving I have manage an excellent 29.2mpg. I love the overall design of the Sable. It looks like a big Milan. The interior is comfortable with plenty of leg and headroom. The materials are great quality. I love the wood trims and the clock in the dash. I think it looks really classy. Also the Sable was rated the safest full-size sedan in America so I feel secure knowing my family is always safe. I really could not ask for a better car. It has been great so far.
mercury,sable,2008,Sverige, 09/19/2007,From Montego to Sable,4,"After 65,000 good miles, mostly highway, on a '05 Montego with only one latent factory defect that was readily fixed, I traded for a new Sable. About the only thing I really wanted was a built in satellite radio. After putting about 800 miles on the Sable I think Ford has just about got it right with the changes between the two models. Both are very roomy and comfortable on long trips."
mercury,sable,2008,Wyoming cowboy, 10/30/2007,This is a great car,5,Seeking an AWD vehicle with good power and plenty of styling and comfort? This one fits the bill. I have owned Subarus and Mercs in the past but this is the best.  I regularly get 27+ mpg at freeway speed.  It handles well in bad weather.  It has a smooth ride and is quiet and solid.  I have 7000 miles without a hint of a problem. Only complaint is that the dark ink blue is nearly black. Go for black if you want or lighter blue as this blue shows its beauty only in bright sun.
mercury,sable,2008,aarttek, 03/08/2008,Reliabe,3,"The car drives well, it is comfortable and handles easily. I use it  to transport seniors from place to place and they  have complemented on the Sable's comfortable ride. "
mercury,sable,2008,Roberto, 03/18/2008,Love my Sable,5,"I have had it 3 months and have 6,500 miles on it driving from Pa to Canada to Florida and back to PA. No problems detected so far. I looked at Buick Lucerne, Honda Accord and Nissan Altima before selecting the Sable. I traded a 2004 Subaru Forester because it wasn't comfortable on long drives. The Sable has a very smooth, quite ride w/good mileage. Sync system took a while to master and performs reasonably well. The Sync system, Sirius and 6 CD player have overwhelmed me w/music choices for those long drives. Overall the Sable is a great value car."
mercury,sable,2008,Darwin, 12/07/2007,Wow,5,08 sable with sync black on black. Wow whata car. Excellent get up and go. Comfortable. Luxury feel for not so much the price. I would reccomend this for anybody! For the money you can't complain.
mercury,sable,2008,RJM, 03/27/2008,A Great Car,4,I enjoy driving my Mercury Sable. It is a very well-built car and has a lot of room. The trunk is large. I receive compliments on it often. 
mercury,sable,2008,Bill Pechilis, 03/30/2008,Smooth car,4,"I traded a Honda Pilot and so far am very pleased. Averaging 24 mpg, like sitting higher, quality seems great. The room is massive without being goofy big on the outside. I love te soft leather and the body shape. As long as it holds up, it's the nicest car I've ever owned in 35 years of driving. Nice job Mercury"
mercury,sable,2008,luvmysable, 04/11/2008,Very impressed and surprised,4,"In 2007 I was in a bad car accident in a small foreign car (I was rear-ended). I resolved to never buy such an unsafe car again. I set out to find the safest car in America and buy it, no matter what. I was sad to have to settle for an old lady car like the Sable. I barely test drove it, picked my color, at least got the chrome wheels, and I was off. I am so completely and totally in love with that car! It is amazing and has so many surprises; stuff my Moms Lexus doesnt even have. And it can *move* if you get on the gas pedal. Its the only car I will ever buy and I will lease a new one in two years, without question. I feel so safe! This was no compromise for me at all! Love it!"
mercury,sable,2008,C Mondo, 04/17/2008,2008 Sable,4,"Just bought this 08 Sable and s far with 600 miles, I love it. Seats are incredibly confortable, ride is smooth and quiet. I compared with the Fusion and when you add the V6 and traction control with to the Fusion, the Sable is a much better value."
mercury,sable,2008,ronsmith38, 05/01/2008,2008 Sable,4,"We replaced a 2000 Olds Silhouette, and wanted a vehicle with high seating. The room in the car and trunk is great. So far with 2000 miles driven, we are getting about 19 mpg in town, and 28/29 on the highway. This is an very good car."
mercury,sable,2008,Jeff, 05/04/2008,2008 Sable is Excellent Value,4,"With the $2,000 Lincoln Mercury Factory Rebate to 6/30/08, the new 2008 Sable has become an exceptional value. It has better sound insulation and upgrades than Taurus. This car has more interior room for 6' 3"" driver and 4 other large adults than any Japanese, German or American car in its price range.  Slightly lower MPG is acceptable trade-off for passenger capacity.  6 Speed Trans and 3.5L V6 are excellent, as is overall fit and finish.  I am very satisfied with this car and I highly recommend the new Sable over its competitors. Ford is making a remarkable turnaround!"
mercury,sable,2008,cthelightnh, 05/05/2008,"Safe, well built, and well designed",4,"Mercury Sable is a very refined vehicle. It is well designed and well built. I have had no initial quality issues which is a first for me. For a large sedan, it has great visibility and feels much smaller when driving.  It has lots of room in both front and rear seats. Trunk is huge! Controls are logical and easy to use.  Stock sound system is pretty good and has a aux input for portable electronics like mp3 players."
mercury,sable,2008,MADE IN U.S.A., 05/10/2008,2008 Sable AWD Premier Merlot/loaded,4,"Replaced a 98 Taurus SE worlds better after ten years. Only problem is some drips in the paint did not notice until first wash will see what Ford is going to do. Decent ride and handling for a car this size, pretty darn comfortable. For the money and 0% interest could not beat it. If you are looking do your a favor and check this car out. Plenty of room AWD and safe. "
mercury,sable,2008,Sable Premier Owner, 05/28/2008,Buy A Used '08 Sable Like I Did!,4,"I bought my 08 Sable Premier in April just as the first used vehicles started showing up at local dealers. Got my '08 with only 7K miles on it and more than two years to go on the warranty. Saved all that first year depreciation, and it looks and drives brand-new. To me, the sweet spot and a great deal. "
mercury,sable,2008,Mike O, 05/30/2008,2008 Sable AWD Premier Black on Black,4,"I'm 6'4"" so I had to special order a Premier edition without the sunroof to ensure I had enough head room.  Had to wait 4 months, but it was worth it.  The dealer gave me the car for $1 under invoice plus a $4,000 rebate. What a steal. When I picked up my new Sable, it was larger and more luxurious than I had remembered. I have taken two long trips (400 miles) and have not been disappointed. Decent MPG for a car of this size, smooth ride, great Sirrius radio, climate control and heated leather seats. I was concerned about leg/foot room, but the more I drive this car the more comfortable it gets. My daughter is 5'11"" and loves the back seat leg room. Merc has a winner here!  "
mercury,sable,2009,rickmm, 09/15/2012,Bring back Murcury; A wonderful car,5," I've owned a 2009 Sable for several years and have found that it has the greatest brakes. They are quick and sure without being too touchy. They have already saved me in an emergency. The steering is quick and on our twisty curvey roads in Penna. this car handles like it is on rails. The engine is very responsive and smooth. It gets amazing gas mileage for a of this size; over 30MPH on the interstate. I agree that it did take some time getting used to the steering wheel being farther away than usual without telescoping however, it feels perfectly normal now. Actually gives you more room, makes other cars feel cramped.
It is such a great car that I
bought a 2nd one for my wife."
mercury,sable,2009,hansenfarm, 07/12/2009,Good later years vehicle,4,"Very happy with the 2009 Sable compared to 2003 Grand Marquis which we still own. Good vehicle for older people for ease of entry, more room than it appears. Is a fun to drive auto and takes less room to park."
mercury,sable,2009,MDNC, 03/03/2010,A Pleasant Surprise,4,"I'll admit, the Mercury Sable wasn't even on my radar screen.  I'd fallen in love with the Lincoln MKZ and was shopping for a late model used one.  In doing my research I ran across quite a number of very low mileage 2009 Mercury Sable Premier program cars.  I liked the Lincoln a lot but the Mercury impressed me even more.  It's a large car with great passenger and trunk space, it has great road manners, it's very comfortable, it gets great safety numbers and the MPG is good for a large car.  It's surprisingly quick and in some ways it reminds me of my a much more refined version of my old 1995 SHO Taurus.  I am really happy with my purchase."
mercury,sable,2009,Sable_Premier2009, 04/12/2010,Good Buy,4,I am very satisfied with my new Sable so far. To be honest I had never heard of the Sable and was not in the market to purchase one. I had my eye on a Chrysler Pacifica. After test driving the Pacifica I stumbled across the Sable and decided to take it for a drive. I was impressed with the features and the smooth ride. The trunk space is great. Price was the deciding factor for me and the fact that it came with so many great features like the Sync and Sirius radio was a perk. I'm happy so far.
mercury,sable,2009,twindad46, 02/20/2011,Buy this car!,5,"What a car!
I recently purchased a slightly used '09 Sable with 28K miles on it and I love it!
Comfortable, good performance, tons of features, good mileage for its size and all for $17K.
I traded in an '06 Chrysler 300 that I hated and the only thing I don't like about this car is that I didn't buy it 2 years ago.
It's a shame they stopped making it, but if you can find one - BUY IT!"
mercury,sable,2009,noslen, 04/22/2009,hidden jewel,4,"I own a 2009 Mercury sable premier awd and I am impressed with this automobile, the updated and very stylish interior feel very lux. The SYNC system is outstanding and easy to use once you read the manual. The car handle is smooth and claim wish it had more Ford power it's also loaded with safety features, exterior is a bit boring and common but I really like this car and would recommend it for ages 28-45 year old males only. It's a man's car"
mercury,sable,2009,TFR, 11/11/2008,Marked improvement,4,"Had a 2005 Montego, almost every change I would have made plus was done with 2009 Sable: bigger engine, better sound system, better trans, antenna off the body, Huge tech advances, rides better, so far two minor complaints gas mileage s/b still be better for a six cylinder and the wiper control a little awkward on the left side of the column, (will get used to it) otherwise great car. If Ford came out with this car two years ago it would have helped their current sad situation."
mercury,sable,2009,Silverfox, 06/14/2020,TIME TO TRADE at only 290 K miles,5,"I had a 2005 Sable premier that I loved (got totaled).  I liked it well enough that I wanted another Sable. Found one on the web. I wanted a silver or light Grey, live down south, and dark cars are too hot. It was used 2009 Premier with all whistles and bells,  85K miles in 2015. I was surprised when I saw it, much larger than the 2005 model.  It had been detailed so well it appeared new, every where. I took it at a great price, 2K under KBB suggestion. I am an UBER driver. My riders love the space in the rear seats, 3 large adults not even touching each other. I'm one that believes in ""if it not broken, don't fix it"". At the current 280K miles nothing has been replaced or fixed under the hood. ALL original and starts and runs smooth. 20.2 over all gas mileage.I live in a city with very bad streets, sink holes, pot holes man hole covers
2 inches above or below the street level. Struts and control arms can't handle that so I have had to replace the control arms twice. Now get to the point of my post. It's time to upgrade and I'm going for a late model Taurus. It seems to be the next thing closest to my Sable.

mercury,villager,2000,Phil, 07/04/2016,"325,000 miles and counting!",5,"2000 and 2001 seem to be ""magic years"" for Quest/Villager from a reliability standpoint; I am the second owner, the first being a family member, and the van had been hit twice (with poor body repair work) prior to my purchase at 50k miles. I look after my cars, but have also raised a kid and hauled all kinds of stuff - beach, camping, moving, a motorcycle, flea markets - and the interior is mint. Yes, I've had to replace a starter and an alternator, brakes and front end components, and of course the timing belt, but I consider these ""consumables"" for the miles racked up. It never left me stranded. Good power and decent gas mileage. Starting at the bad body repairs, the Villager started rusting, then a snowplow did a nasty ""hit and run"" while parked, so it's now ugly and no longer worth putting money into, unfortunately.

No major problems, have only had to do regular maintenance until just recent. Now it's starting to run rough, like it's going to stall out. Shimmy in the steering when I go over 70 mph. Replaced timing belt at 100k. repaired ac switch (front & back) around 120k. No probs with windows, radio, doors. Oxidation and paint peeling but it's 11 yrs old & we live in FL!

It has been reliable over all but it has had several wear & tear issues such as new brakes, bad distibutor & new tires. Theres also a knocking or crunching noise coming from the driver side wheel over bumps. It think it may be cv joint or something.

So its not invinsible but its definitley reliable & a phenomenal value. I just hope mine hold up to 200-250k miles like many others have. "

about a year now, and I love it.  The 
leather seats are very comfortable.  
The passengers like the dual a/c 
controls, and the rear floor heater.  
The interior is designed well, and it's 
not bad on the outside, either.  The 7 
passenger seating allows space for 
everyone, and the quad seating is very 
comfortable.  I average about 20 mpg, 
and I do a lot of city driving.  
Highway mileage is better.  It is 
smaller than some other minivans, but 
it is big on comfort, so that makes up 
for any size difference.  Overall, I 
think it is a very good value."
mercury,villager,2000,KForringer, 10/12/2002,Please bring them back,4,"I have owned my Mercury Villager for 2 
1/2 years now and love it.  We test 
drove many minivans and while this was 
one of the smaller vans, it handled 
very well and felt more like a car than 
a van.  In the time that we have had 
it, we have only had to do minor maint. 
items.  Which is more than I can say 
for the Caravan that we had before!!  
It was well worth the money we paid and 
I wish they would bring them back."

Solid build and dependability alone would lead me to buy another, but alas, service from my dealer is well below par.  A/C has leaked since new and three trips to dealer have failed to fix it.  They just squirt in some more coolant, call it a fix and send me on my way:(  "

I'll probably drive it another 100K or so but I'll definitely buy another Mercury/Ford product. I have an F-150 with 160K miles on it and no problems for it either. Ford makes a great product. My father has one with 400K miles on it. Buy American....Buy a Ford!  "
mercury,villager,2000,Kristen, 07/07/2018,Cheap luxury,4,"I really read up on these before I bought it and it has been pretty much everything I read. It's a great little car like minivan with a beautiful leather seat interior and really cool removable seats except for the rear bench that does slide back and forth. 
I just needed something roomy and comfortable for me, my husband and our two dogs but I wanted something that got decent gas mileage. There are some issues with the front end as it says they do, the previous owner did have the tie rod done and we had to have the CV joint done and there are issues with the speedometer display just going blank like it says they do, we are going to look into getting that replaced but it is still working. Overall we are very happy with it and it is doing everything I wanted and it was inexpensive so we can put a little more into it and get several more years out of it.

My family really like the vehicle but we had to upgrade because of resale value. Great on long trips! We will miss this vehicle greatly. It has had its wear as we had bought it used also. Just afraid it will not last as long as we need it to. My children will miss this vehicle greatly.
mercury,villager,2000,Drew in MA, 12/27/2008,Excellent Mini Van,5,"I have had this van for only 2 years, and bought it with 50K on it.  Other than having to do brakes, the van has been great! Goes well in the snow with the Eagle LS radials, and the mileage is decent as well! I would buy another low mileage one f these in a New York minute!  I am sure the Monterey is a great van, but the Villager Estate has the moon roof, and awesome mini-van option!"
mercury,villager,2000,TJ, 02/08/2009,Great Van,4,"We purchased this van new and it has been an excellent vehicle.  We currently have 173,000 miles and all original equipment.  It's never been in the shop except for maintenance items.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one if we still needed a van. We purchased a new 2008 Ford Edge and love that too.  I'll probably sell the van at 200K just so I can get a new car."

I work in Real Estate, so I have put many miles on it, and it has been very reliable and fun to drive, and I have had lots of compliments on the look and comfort of it. I hope I can get another 50K miles on it, but if not, will definitely consider Mercury again. Would like something with a little better mileage, but I still get 29-22 mpg, so that's not bad."

Just had it towed last week and had to say good- bye. Will miss all the bells and whistles. When I was low on gas, it told me how many miles I could still  drive until empty.  It has a roomy interior; bigger than you think. I had a Previa before, so it seemed small at first, but it really met our needs as the boys went through middle and high school. It had 154,000 miles when it died. With the diagnosis, a engine cooling fan that was freezing up, and the repairs with labor estimated at over $800, I decided it was time to say good-bye. Lots of fun family trips. "

I now have 110k + miles and it still runs as strong as the day I purchased it. Maintenance is key to long engine life! Brakes, tires and other replacables are only items put on our black beauty. I would highly suggest putting on a great set of tires to match engine zip. I'm currently running yokohomo's. OEM tires were,of course replaced after 30k seating of 5 is no problem especially on long trips. Did I say I also pull a 2,000 lb. boat? Great van, purchased with very few regrets! "

Thankfully, after two hard bumps against the guardrail, we were blessed with no major injuries (my wife, my 3 year old and me) but a totalled minivan.

I hate this van and would not recommend it to anyone. It is noisy, has brake issues, ac issues and has slow acceleration. It eats gas as if it were an truck. Very very disappointing buy.

Only problems I've had were the usual Ford electrical gremlins.
It is a gas hog.
Seating system is poorly designed.

No kids, just need the cargo space for my work stuff. Cargo space is pretty versatile. The third row bench seat has been set to vertical pretty much since I got the vehicle. Second row seats are easy to set to vertical or click out / lift out and return as required.

Only 44,000 miles. Only serious problem has been body corrosion and faded paint from the lawn sprinklers at my outdoor condo parking. Body took a sand-blast beating in Wilma hurricane; smashed side windows and windshield replaced. The van just laughed that off.

Handling and driving are the best. Engine is perfect - and powerful. Great acceleration. Good visuals on all sides. I can weave through heavy city traffic more nimbly than a Ferrari. I chuckle to myself because nobody expects a car looking like this to perform like that!

On long distance driving I set the cruise to 70 mph (freeway legal), crank up the CDs and enjoy the comfort. If required, the van can accelerate quickly to 85-90, no problem to get out of a tricky situation. Easy to park in a crowded lot or garage. 

Only repairs in 14 years: brake joints, something minor with the steering.  To be honest, I have not taken the best care of the engine in terms of oil changes and other regular maintenance, especially in our humid coastal climate. This van just keeps going with a smile.

Cannot figure WHY WHY WHY was this model discontinued!!  Stupid people. The onboard technology is still superior to many current minivans.

Nothing else measures up. :(

mercury,villager,2002,alanstern, 12/20/2009,Villager by choice,4,"My second Villager.  Editors think this is a junker,  I like it better than the Sienna and Odyssey plus a lot cheaper. Seating configuration works for me..I'm a musician.  Power and gas mileage are more than adequate.  What about the falling rear window wiper blade?  Mine's the fourth one I've seen.  Shouldn't this be a safety recall Issue? No serious problems."
mercury,villager,2002,nsandford, 11/08/2002,Awesome van,4,"This vehicle is very comfortable.  The 
options are few but great.  We did not 
add-on anything, as it is fine the way 
it is.  It is very fun to drive.  It is 
such a smooth ride and the seats are 
very comfortable.  It is very easy for 
my 85 year old crippled grandmother to 
get in and out (verus a car, which is 
nearly impossible)."
mercury,villager,2002,David46, 10/21/2002,Love the Van,4,"We have had the van for couple of 
months, but we are very pleased with 
it.  While we have had to take it to 
the dealership for some minor ""tuning"" 
(back hatch door didn't raise all the 
way, squeaky passenger side window) we 
don't feel this is a big deal since it 
is simply laughable to expect 
perfection from a machine with 
thousands of moving parts.  The van 
drives well . . . good pickup . . . 
carries everything we need . . . looks 
great even when compared to Honda's 
allegedly fantastic minivan.  This is 
our fourth mini-van, but first 
Villager, and we are upset we didn't 
try it before.  They are making a 
mistake discontinuing it."
mercury,villager,2002,SAM1, 11/09/2002,SECOND ONE OWNED,4,"This is my second one; I've had good 
luck with both. The gas mileage is 
good for a minivan. I don't have a 
problem with the cargo space. My '97 
had some electrical problems. The 
middle seats are heavy to remove."
mercury,villager,2002,stephen, 12/23/2002,2002mvilliager,4,"The Villager is an easy mini-van to 
drive.  Plenty of room for kids and 
gear.  Lots of options for the money.  
Needs the heat for the rear to be 
couple in eith the a/c controls.  
Vehicle is well laid out, all controls 
are easy to reach.  Plenty of leg 
room.  Good looking vehicle."
mercury,villager,2002,Stevenff, 10/03/2003,Excellent Value,4,"We purchased our 2002 Villager Sport 
ussed with 11,000 miles on it for about 
half the sticker price. Like buying a 
new car for half price. We had a 98 
Windstar but wanted a smaller van. The 
Villager is perfect. Large enough to be 
comfortable, small enough to be easy to 
manouver. It is a shame they 
discontinued it. The Villager filled a 
niche that is fast disappearing as most 
minivans keep gaining weight and size. 
Sometimes ""bigger is not better"" for 
everyone."
mercury,villager,2002,arigan, 07/15/2005,a van for comfort,4,"This minivan is really comfortable for a bad back.  It doesn't drive like a truck, which is one thing I don't like about vans.  It does really well on curves.  The mileage is great for on freeway driving.  I drove approximately 240 miles on the freeway and I was very pleased with the use of fuel.  Less than a half a tank of gas.       "
mercury,villager,2002,Kim, 08/31/2006,Most comfortable and efficient Van,4,"This is the first minivan I have owned and am very pleased with the comfort and the fuel economy. I have gotten 23- 25 mpg highway miles.  Also, the leather seats are very comfortable with a lumbar support for the driver. I have to travel long distances to work and the comfort is great since I have a bad back.  The sound quality is great especially with the video system.  The only compliant are the tires; Michelin Symmerty tires are already worn badly at 60,000 miles and are very rough.  Overall this is the best car I have ever owned. Unfortunately they (Nissan) don't make this van anymore. It is basically a Nissan Quest."
mercury,villager,2002,Rob Roy, 05/07/2003,2002 Villager Estate,3,"I have now had my 2002 Villager Estate 
for about a year and put about 7000 
miles on it. Gearshift indicator broke, 
but easily fixed. The gas mileage could 
be better. Other than that I like the 
van pretty well, needs to come with 
stiffer tires than the Goodyear tires 
that came on it. They should have 
redesigned it and cut off some of the 
weight rather than stop making it. Now 
when you get a Merc van, you are 
getting a Ford Winstar with Merc 
nameplate. I would recommend a used one 
of these vans."
mercury,villager,2002,C-man, 12/27/2008,Great Van,3,"This is more comfortable and easier to manuver than the last 1998 Ford Arrowstar. Always tends to give plenty of warning before anything breaks or gives out so you can take it in and have it fixed before you are stuck. Could use more leg room for driver. A little better acceleration ability would be very nice, however it does seem to hold its own. Very nice manuverability and drives well in any weather. It is hard to do any of the work on your own under the hood as it is all compact and squashed together making it very difficult to do it yourself. It only has two key locks, one on the driver door, and one for the hatch. Would like to see one on front passenger door as well."
mercury,villager,2002,jimd, 01/13/2009,#3,4,This is our third Estate. The first one went 260K before we traded for a '98. That went 190K before I demolished it. Car was toast but wife and I walked away. Interesting note. Injuries in accidents are roughly half of those in other vehicles.Just bought '02. Expect the same great reliability.  Only problem was Ford CD changer which went south at 140K on both previous cars Newer one has simple player. I guess we'll have to hang on to this one. 
mercury,villager,2002,86bmw325i, 04/27/2009,Great Van with few problems,4,"This van is great. This is my 7th year of owning it and had a previous 1995 model Villager. I love the performance and semi sporty handling, better than the other minivans I test drove. The interior is well designed, except that it has so much plastic used. The dashboard rattles when it idles, so I took it too the dealership, but of coarse they said they couldn't hear it. Had an exhaust leak at about 90k, the mechanic couldn't order the right part because they quit making it, so he had to weld the old one. It still whines a little when you accelerate, nothing big, though. Also, I can feel engine vibrations through the steering wheel. But, other than that, it's a great mini-van."
mercury,villager,2002,Denzil, 10/29/2009,Number and still going,4,"I've owned 5 Mercury Villagers, starting with a 1995 nautica version.  I keep buying them because they're the best vehicle Ford ever made.  I've put no less than 100,000 miles on each of them, this one has 115,000 miles and is in excellent condition My first one, I sold to a friend is stiil on the road, and he is still a friend.  If Ford still made them, I'd buy another.  Too bad Ford and Nissan couldn't work out their joint venture, Ford would still be in the mini-van market and have a greater market share.  If Ford would have put some of the features of the Villager in the Windstar they'd have sold a bunch more of them. I love mine and will drive it until it drops since I can't buy another"
mercury,villager,2002,Jeff Purdy, 09/24/2002,The Mercury Villager,4,"The Mercury Villager is a great 
minivan. We have owned three, a 1996 GS 
model, a 1998 Multi-Sport model, and 
now a 2002 Estate model. They have been 
good to us. It is too bad Mercury is 
going to stop making them.They are 
comfortable, quiet, and kind of neat-
looking. Nissan did a good job of 
designing them."
mercury,villager,2002,kcowboy, 09/24/2002,Good Mini-Van,4,"Excellent mini-van with all the bells 
and whistles that won't break the bank.
You can get a great deal on one because 
its the last year their making it. Its 
the type of vehicle that you don't have 
to pay sticker on! unlike some brands. 
This is our second Villager our other 
was a 93 and it never had any problems."
mercury,villager,2002,trapfreek, 08/18/2012,Been a good Van,4,My wife and I have had this van for 8 years (second owner) and it has had no problems. My only complaint is that a strong wind will move it around a bit on the freeway and the seat will not go back quite far enough for me. All we have done in the past 8 years was front brake pads and a new battery. My daughter gets our hand me down cars and I hope this will keep going as well for her for a couple more years.
mercury,villager,2002,Blondie 2003, 03/21/2003,My second Villager,4,"This 2002 Sport is my second Villager. 
I just picked it up yesterday. My '94 
Villager LS had 123,000 miles on it at 
trade in and was a wonderfully reliable 
and comfortable vehicle.So far I am 
very pleased with the looks, design and 
comfort of my new Villager."
mercury,villager,2002,Steve, 11/26/2006,Mercury Villager,4,This is our second Mercury Villager. There great vans. We have always been pleased.
mercury,villager,2002,Pmpepsi, 09/21/2002,Time for retirement,2,"Retirement for the villager comes none 
too soon.  It lacks the features and 
refinement of other minivans.  
Reliability has been the biggest 
shortcoming.  This is a perfect of 
Fords fall from grace in recent years.  
Problems include a loss of breaks, 
transmission issues and relentless 
rattles and squeaks.  Interior 
materials have that cheap look of and 
economy car, certainly not what you 
expect in a upscale Mercury."
mercury,villager,2002,Levi, 12/23/2002,mercury villager,5,"This is my second villager purchase.  
My 93 with 85kmiles has never let us 
down. we decided tp keep it for my 16 
year old son. The new villager with all 
the bells was only 18300 which I feel 
is a great deal for this van"
mercury,villager,2002,Caren Idella Scott, 11/14/2019,Overdrive cruised controlling spontaneous awesome.,4,"The passengers seats
 in the middle can be removed and your gas mileage will increase because the seats weighed over 60 pounds each.

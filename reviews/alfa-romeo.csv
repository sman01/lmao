alfa-romeo,4c,2015,bruinnut, 01/20/2016,A true exotic that you need to drive to believe,5,"This car is not for everyone. It is not for those who want to drive a ubiquitous people mover from point A to point B. It is not for those who want to be in a cocoon separated from the road and without feel for the spirit of enjoyment on the road. But if you want a car that inspires, that will keep a smile on your face, that allows you to understand the relationship between road and machine in the most intimate and spirited detail, then the Alfa Romeo 4C is the only car south of $300k that will punch your ticket. 

The 4C is beautiful and masterful inside and out. The cockpit is made entirely of carbon fiber. The panels are made of high strength and lightweight sheet moulding compound. The engine is a highly tuned turbocharged 4 cylinder mid-mounted masterpiece, that delivers a cacophony of sounds that will let the driver know exactly how much fun it is having. The gearbox is a choice of paddle shifters or automatic, with a driver-selected all weather, normal, dynamic, or race mode. 

The cockpit is made for the driver. The controls are tilted to the left; the steering wheel is not a joystick with volume controls, bluetooth buttons, navigation, or cruise control. It is made to steer and to allow you to easily shift gears.  The seats are firm, comfortable, and supportive. If you want a bunch of buttons to move it up and down, inflate a back bolster, or cradle you with cushions, circulating air, and heat, look elsewhere. If you want simple and comfortable functionality, then this seat is perfect.

When on a drive, please plan extra time for taking the long way home, to the office, to the gas station, or anywhere else. You'll want to take that extra turn to stay behind the wheel. And when you park it or stop to get gas or groceries, get ready for folks you don't know to spill out and engage you in conversation as they daydream about driving your car. Yes, it is that amazing.

Update after 9 months of ownership:  

The 4C still puts a smile on my face every time I start it up. I've taken some day-long trips and the supercar has performed flawlessly. So far, there have been no technical or mechanical issues with the vehicle. The 4C is a rare vehicle and will certainly continue to turn heads for years to come, both for its sheer beauty and design, but also because it will prove to be a timeless sportscar. 

By the way, the 4C won't be around for ever. If you want to experience a true supercar at a BMW coupe price, now's the time.

alfa-romeo,4c,2015,bob, 03/18/2016,"If you like 80's exotics, this car is for you.",4,"It's been said before -- this car is not for everyone.  But, if you love driving a light, tight, awesome looking, sensory overkill fast sports car, this is your vehicle.  

The 4c is unlike anything else on the road today -- and thank heavens for it.  Now, if you want comfort, quiet, listening to your tunes while drinking a latte, and wanting to be unseen when puttering around town, then this is not your car.  Enjoy your Lexus.

Pros:  Just a blast to drive.  Its ""honest"" which in itself is unique today.  Nothing is covered up or added simply to fool anyone.  It's the real deal, not fake.  It's exciting, refreshing and unlike any other car made today.  It's obviously hand built and fit and finish is better than most exotics. The beautiful carbon fibre interior will make your eyes water every time you look inside.   The noise from the turbo charger waste gates will make you laugh out loud. It sounds a like 80's rally cars and seems to go like one as well.  Performance is more than fine for city streets.  You can floor it and run it through the gears without being tossed in jail.  The F1 style gearbox works remarkably well -- better than a Ferrari F430.

What's also surprised me is how reliable it has been.  In a year of ownership, not one thing has gone wrong.   To say I was expecting something different is an understatement.

And the car is just beautiful, along with being completely unique. If you want people to look at you, buy this car.  Between the noise and the looks you'll be a rock star on the boulevard.  Service is also very reasonable.  Yearly service on the car is only $240.  Try that in a Ferrari or Lamborghini.

Cons:  Ok, it's noisy,  And the wide body and doors do make it difficult to park in a normal parking space.  And it's a pain to get in and out of.  And it's a bit difficult to see out the back of. And the trunk is ridiculously small.  And the trunk latch is in a silly place.  And the seats are tight. And the seats don't move a lot. And the seat belt warning buzzer is annoying.  And it has no GPS. And the seat belts rub against your neck.  And there's no glove box.  And there's these silly wires coming out from under the dash to charge your phone.  And the cup holders don't hold larger drinks. And it has some turbo lag. And if you want to put things in the trunk, you have to put them on the ground first because you need both hands to open and latch the rear lid. And it has no power steering so parking can require some actual muscle use.  And if you're over 6 foot 3 you're going to say it's too small.  And if you're too wide the seats are going to be uncomfortable.  And it doesn't come with a manual gearbox.  And there's no climate control. And the Parrot radio is a complete joke.

So if the Cons have turned you off by now, then you know this car is not for you.  But if you love the idea of driving an 80's exotic with all of it's drama, feel, personality and looks BUT with AC and brakes that actually work in a car that doesn't fall apart before your eyes and is reasonably affordable to own, then this car is for you.

I personally love it.  You can thrash it unlike you can other more expensive sports cars and it only costs about the same as the 10,000 Corvette C7's you see everyday.

Thank heavens for Alfa Romeo. Someone was nutty enough to make a car a real drivers car today that doesn't seem like every other car you drive.  I don't think we will ever see anything like it again that us normal folk can afford.  Its a modern classic with a classic personality.  Now, how cool is that?

alfa-romeo,4c,2015,4C4ME, 03/17/2016,Most fun car I have ever owned,5,"If you love to drive -  this is your car.  It is fast, corners well, creates conversations and makes you smile!  I have never enjoyed driving so much.  Until I owned this car I was never a ""car guy"".  Now I am.  Best decision I ever made.  This is a true sports car, not a GTO, not a family car.  It is uncompromising and unapologetic.  The best comment I ever heard that perfectly describes the 4C was by a mom who asked if her son could go over and look at my ""Hot Wheels"" car.  That captures the essence of the 4C.  It will bring out the kid inside of you!

alfa-romeo,4c,2015,Phil Berry, 04/17/2016,Alfa Lovers Only,5,"I have owned 11 Alfas in my life. This is the best one ever. Mid engine, 4 seconds 0-60, maximum 160 MPH, and 43 MPG. A PURE Sports Car.

alfa-romeo,4c,2018,SPYDER, 07/16/2019,62 Yrs old - SPYDER is my name!,5,"     This Alfa Romeo 4C Spider is the most engaging car I have ever driven...every time I get into this supercar, a smile comes on my face!! If you love twisty, tight corner back roads...this car never disappoints!!
      I drive with many other drivers of different makes...on these back roads...and they are wishing to drive an Alfa Romeo 4C instead...First, They cannot keep up, secondly...the handling of the 4C is with it's extremely wide footprint...is noticeably unmatched by their vehicles!
They definitely know what an Italian Supercar is all about!!
     I realized at 62 yrs old...life is short...I am having a blast before it is my time to go!!

alfa-romeo,4c,2018,Timmnk, 03/11/2020,Supercar?,5,Not sure I would call it that...but its a fine auto.
alfa-romeo,giulia,2017,Mr. Auto Expert, 08/02/2017,The best sports sedan available today!,5,"I have owned 67 cars since 1974.  Many of them were high performance or luxury vehicles.  From all the world's major companies.  (BMW x4, Audi x2, Mercedes x2, Lincoln x2, Cadillac x3, Porsche x3, Saab x2 to name only a few)  In that collection which I have bought and sold, I owned 3 Alfa Romeo's pre-1995.   This new Alfa Romeo Giulia sports sedan is BY FAR, the best car I've ever owned, period.   There have been ZERO reliability issues, that seem to consistently plague Italian made vehicles. I base my review on my 44 yrs of car driving experience and knowledge of automobiles in general.  Styling, performance, handling, and practicality.  I give this car the highest marks possible in each of those important categories. If you are considering leasing or buying a new 3-Series BMW, C-Class Mercedes, or Audi A4 or Lexus, drive this car first, so you can be impressed by the overall stupendous drivability and performance of this fantastic Italian masterpiece!   I can not recommend this car highly enough.   Now that its been 3 years of ownership, I can add that the reliability has been perfect for this sport sedan.  I have had zero problems or issues with the car.  Obviously Alfa Romeo has greatly improved their reliability from past experiences.   This is an outstanding car and a true value.  After driving this for two years now, I still say the Giulia is the best sport sedan sold today.  We've had ZERO problems with this car.  Everything is wonderful, especially the driving experience we have daily with it.

alfa-romeo,giulia,2017,Jerry Jerome, 06/15/2017,This car is a head turner,5,"I have owned a 2017 Guilia TI for 3 months.  There was a glitch in the voice recognition portion of the phone blue tooth funtion that was fixed after several attempts and is now functioning flawlessly.  I have owned MB, BMW and Audi's and this car accelerates, stops and handles better than any vehicle I have ever owned.  People are always stopping me to admire the car and ask about it. It looks as good as it drives.
"
alfa-romeo,giulia,2017,ECCalfa, 03/08/2017,Love it,5,"Love the design. It's eye catching. The handling is incredible. The 4 cylinder sounds like a V6 and has a good growl. It's a blast to drive. It has a lot of cool features like auto wipers, collision warning, and headlights that light up the corners when you start a turn. The Harmon Kardon speakers sound great.  The tech package is very simple, but it works really well and takes no time to master.  My guess is while it's more basic it's probably going to be better than most systems that they try to force too many features in and they are glitchy. Slam on the breaks and the car stays flat, zero noise drive.  The quality is top notch, not single defect or rattle. Only had it for a few weeks - really hoping the reliability is there too. The front sport seats are a tad hard and seem to be built for smaller people. The shifter is taking some time to get used to. That's about all I can find on the downside.

2 year update - still love it. Mine has been more trouble free than the Infiniti I had prior to this car. A few little quirks here and there but nothing worth mentioning.

alfa-romeo,giulia,2017,Ross K, 10/04/2018,"25,000 miles and still in love",5,"I have just hit 25,000 and haven't had one issue with my Giulia. So if anyone's concerned about reliability, my Giulia is proof that Alfa got this car right!  Sure, there will always be a few cars that will have issues, and that's true of every brand.  But the modern Alfa Romeo is nothing like the Alfas of the 70s and 80s if that's what people are worried about.  And, I will second all the positive things everyone else says about this car.  Driving the Giulia is a revelation!  Best car I've ever owned.   If you enjoy driving, then there's no other car at this price that's better.  And if you don't enjoy driving, the Giulia will probably change that!  It feels like a sports car in every respect, but is as liveable and comfortable as any sedan commuter.  it's the best of both worlds, and totally worth it!

alfa-romeo,giulia,2017,jb7227, 04/06/2017,Something special!,5,"I have only had my Quadrifoglio for about a week....but you know as soon as you get in, that you are driving something special.  I have a relatively well-optioned car including the carbon ceramic brakes, MSRP about $87k.    This car gets a LOT of thumbs up...get used to it!  You can dial the personality you want this car to have...in Dynamic mode (haven't tried ""race"" mode yet, want to break in the car properly!) it feels really tight...in ""natural"" mode, a comfortable daily driver....but you always have the feeling this car wants to run fast.  Unlike some reviews online, i found the interior to be of very high quality...the dashboard looks like it came from a Ferrari.  I am considering a set of Michelin Pilot Sport high performance all season tires, as I can already tell the Pirelli PZero Corsa tires will not last more than about 7,500 miles on the high end!  I have the standard seats, but if you purchase a car with the optional carbon fiber seats, definitely try them before you buy....the basic seats have plenty of bolstering and more power adjustments.  Not that it matters...but so far, in relatively gentle driving (again...trying to break it in for the first 500 miles or so)...average MPG is about 19 according to the on-board computer.  I have the Rosso Competizione exterior color...it looks fabulous...but i did notice that most dealers first Quadrifoglios were Vulcano black.  Although the black looks nice, IMO it doesn't do the car justice, as the carbon fiber bits kind of get ""lost"" in a sea of black....Overall impression...it's even better than I expected!!!!

alfa-romeo,giulia,2017,Greg Dwyer, 07/12/2018,"Sexy, Spoty, and Moments of WTF",5,"Update below original review:
I moved into the Alfa Romeo from a Ford Taurus SHO, looking for a car comfortable both on the commute, and on the track with minimal adjustments.  The Alfa turns my commute into a day at the track with the precision handling, incredible tire-chirping acceleration, which is especially aggressive when passing.  The cost was comparable to the SHO--I ended up at around $35k once all the incentives were included (No trade in.)                                                                                                   The fit and finish of this car is amazing.  Tight, quiet, luxurious to the touch.  Get the glass roof.  Without, it seems somewhat looser, more warehouse-y.  The trunk room is pure Alfa Romeo ""What do you need luggage for?""  And things like cup holders are designed for afternoon tea, not a days' worth of coffee in a Yeti.  Bigger containers make adjusting some of the controls a little cumbersome.  No more so that Alfa has done to themselves.  Very frustrating controls for things like the fan motor.  It has a rotary control, but it's brain is attached to the dash display, so rotating the fan one turn only ""wakes the display"" but doesn't do anything for the fan speed.  Not the biggest deal, but you wonder why the two different systems to control one item.  And when you're in reverse, nothing else can be controlled...radio, temp, etc because the reverse view camera is occupying the display.  Like I said, cumbersome.  But that's my only complaint.  My dealer is awesome--they understand a certain level of service is expected here with Alfa--unlike my ford guys.  The is a slight steering wheel rubbing that they are having a time trying to figure out--so until then it's just more volume on the radio (unless I'm backing up!)

Update: I am no longer the owner.  The little things became big things.  Just wasn't the car for me, I guess.  The steering wheel rub never got worked out--and only got more pronounced.  I had to have the front facia replaced after hitting a rather aggressive pothole, and that experience was awful--from my dealer not being able to even order the piece from the manufacturer for 4 weeks, to it being installed incorrectly, and painted the wrong color.  The whole car glistened with the slightest pearl int he white, but the facia was like white-out correction fluid.  Then the repaint had drips between the pieces--by this time (A year) the squeaked and rattles that Alfa owners warned me about began to appear.  The fan never seemed like it was connected to the vents.  Highest blower setting netted almost no air into the cabin.  rear passengers told me of the extreme heat coming through the back seat into the cabin, and were frankly soaked after a road trip.  My Hood latches would intermittently unlatch, a problem they could never quite fix, so for a time, I had white race tape across the hood--not the look I was going for.  The shop pulled my hood release handle so hard it came off in their hands, and that was never the same.

I'm back to a SHO, where the power is more, and handling is less.  But I'll just become a better driver.

alfa-romeo,giulia,2017,Bill Nelson, 04/05/2017,Alfa Quad is almost practical,5,The Alfa Romeo Giulia Quad offers extraordinary performance and yet can be reasonably driven as a freeway cruiser. The seats are comfortable. The controls intuitive and the fit and finish at a high standard. There's something wonderful about being in a four door sedan powered by a Ferrari-derived engine that handles like a race car. I've only 500 miles on the odometer but so far I've had no issues of any kind. And I forgot to mention that the car is drop dead gorgeous.
alfa-romeo,giulia,2017,John S., 07/11/2017,Fun to drive,5,"Amazing power for a 4 cyl........transmission is the best I  have ever driven. In dynamic mode,using paddle shift,this car is so much fun to drive.Steering/braking performance is first class. Get ""thumbs up""from other drivers every time I go out. Had the car for a month,with zero problems. Was impressed that Alfa Romeo USA called to thank me for my purchase,and gave me phone #to call if I had any issues  in the future.

alfa-romeo,giulia,2017,Veloce, 12/02/2017,Excellent choice,5,"I've owned many different luxury sedans, including Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Lancia. The quality of the Alfa Giulia is outstanding, especially in the higher trims with Luxury and Sport packages like mine. Handling is superb,  driving pleasure is the best you can expect and everything is well made outside and inside. Alfa has come back stronger then ever and the numerous international awards are confirming it. Many talk about the reliability issue but statistics prove that Alfa does not have more problems then the competitors. I had zero issues so far. 12/05/2010 Update: after 3 years of ownership,  not  single issue. I replaced rhe 2017 with a 2019 one year ago and it's still the same amazing experience. Well beyond expectations.

alfa-romeo,giulia,2017,Gregory J, 04/18/2018,"After 25,000 miles-An Update",5,"Back in the day I have owned Lancia's and Fiats. More recently I have largely been on a Mercedes kick. I leased this to replace a Mercedes 250 SLK- beautiful car for sure- but does not drive better than it looks. The Giulia on the other hand is also a beautiful car- but it DOES drive better than it looks. Drive one- an you will immediately know what this car is about. If you love driving- you will love the Giulia. I wrote that when I firs got the car. After 25K- love it even more. If you like to drive and dont have 80K for a car- you gotta drive this.

alfa-romeo,giulia,2017,C Roussin, 08/24/2018,Totally connecting driver and road,5,"This car directly connects me to the road through perfectly balanced handling, excellent power, great brakes.

alfa-romeo,giulia,2017,centurian65, 10/18/2017,Stranded-Update,1,"Less than 3100 miles. Car shuts downon freeway driving 75 MPH. Had to coast to shoulder. 3 hours for Alfa Road side assistance to get a tow truck.  Car has been at dealer now since Saturday (today is tuesday) and they still have no idea what went wrong.  Dealership was unable or unwilling to help me witha loaner when car went down.

UPDATE:  Car has been in the shop two additional times since original review.  First the headlights were defective and needed replaced.  Now it is waiting for a new motor.  When the headlights were replaced the service advisor and i heard a knocking sound coming from the engine. They initially thought it was pulley. A detailed examination by the dealership working with engineers in italy determined the knock was in the lower end of the engine.  So it needs to be replaced. 

The sunroof is noisy when closed.  

Luckily everything is covered bt the warranty, but this is now 3 months the car has been out of service. I love the styling, but will not be keeping this car.
"
alfa-romeo,giulia,2017,Gary, 10/04/2017,Most enjoyable to drive,5,"My first Alfa. Coming from a string of Germans and one boring Asian luxury experience. This is likely the smallest sedan I've owned, yet seems to be sufficiently roomy as a daily driver. The drive is what this car is about. It is so light, responsive, and eager to turn, that I find gravitating toward it much more often rather then 3 other vehicles we have access to. Exterior is ok. Distinctive, without flashy. Interior (mine is red) is stunning even in base model. Base seats are average - should've gone for bolstered versions. Putting mildly eccentric controls aside, including the nagging driver seat which insists on sliding back when car is shut off, the DRIVE is what this thing is all about. I compared RWD to AWD and opted for RWD. It feels significantly lighter and more responsive. Speaking of responsive, the base 4-cyclinder is hugely responsive, especially when engaging 'Dynamic' mode via control knob. The car feels quick for sure and I dare say, border line FAST. Emphasis on the feel, not actual numbers (whatever they are). After wondering about looking for a fun to drive vehicle, this appears to be a perfect choice after the first few weeks.
"
alfa-romeo,giulia,2017,QVORBUST, 07/02/2018,Unbelievable Car,5,"I have seen the previous two reviews and find them a little hard to believe especially the brake issue.  Believe me if Alfa or anyone else thought the car had a brake failure and run the risk of a fatality gimme a “brake”.  My guess is there are a lot of folks that either this is their first car or really need to buy a Toyota.  I have had my QV for 17 months and not one problem other than a flat tire.  It is the most fun car and I don’t see myself coming and going on the road as every other car.  For a new model year I was very sensitive and concerned.  NOT ANYMORE.  The car is great.  Alfa Customer Care follows up on every appointment and if the problem is not resolved they escalate for you. I am having a very hard time believing that there is not an issue like the previous poster described.  I read it twice and knowing the car and the rules these stories are a bit far fetched at least the one where they are so afraid to drive the car because the brakes failed and the dealership said there was not a problem with the brakes.  I guess they need to apply pressure to the brake peddle. For the car going into neutral on its own I would say the shifter is tricky for the newbie.  Might want to make sure you don’t reach over and move it when driving.  Neutral at 70 plus a mile speed is not dangerous anyway.  Getting a flat at 70 is.
"
alfa-romeo,giulia,2017,Wayne Grabow, 08/22/2018,Like an extension of your mind,5,"We had been shopping new cars for about six months when we came across a Giulia Lusso equipped just the way we wanted.  It was used (4000 miles) but in perfect shape.  It is my wife's car, but I got to drive it last weekend for a 300+ mile trip to the Colorado mountains.  OMG.  Those curving mountain roads are a real test track.  We ran at speeds up to 90 mph; up and down mountains; curve after curve; slow then fast.  Use the brakes gently; they respond quickly.  When you have a chance to pass, you will swiftly overtake.  Suspension is very confidence inspiring.  The controls are very complete and easy to read.  The seats brought us to our destination in comfort.  The interior is beautiful.  We love the compact size of the car; luggage room for two was ample.  This car replaces a BMW 228i  which  handled well, but this feels much more deluxe.  Our other sedan is a Jag XF; my wife calls this her ""little Jag"".  We couldn't be happier at this point.

A year later:  The Giulia Lusso has been flawless.  Although we have only had to visit our Alfa dealership in Denver for the 10K service, it is a beautiful, clean and supportive location.  It is my wife's car, and she loves it.  Beautiful and distinctive; quick and responsive; fuel efficient yet powerful.  We didn't need to get winter tires; the OE tires provided adequate traction through the winter.  I think that for many people who are dissatisfied with their car, it is because they didn't really define their needs and wants before choosing.  They didn't get a ""bad"" car; they got the wrong car.  This Alfa is just what we wanted.  At 12K miles, we are very satisfied.
At two years:  Still no defects noted.  We have noticed one ""limitation"", it is not a good car for deep snow.  The clearance between the tires and surrounding wheel wells is tight enough that the space fills up with packed snow on occasion which can actually make it harder to turn the front wheels in sharp corners.
At 17,000 miles we had to have the tires replaced and the alignment checked and adjusted..  Both front tires were worn to the belts on the inside edge while having significant tread remaining on the more visible outside edges.  To me, this indicates that the alignment had been set improperly, but having bought the car used, not sure I can blame the manufacturer.

It’s not a sterile BMW or Mercedes, that contain as much passion as a rock. This is a REAL CAR for people that enjoy driving.  This isn’t transportation it’s an experience. After more than six months and 8500 miles the car has been flawless and continues to amaze me.  It just went in for its first service which is complimentary.

alfa-romeo,giulia,2017,Art Haskins, 03/16/2017,Had to buy it,5,"The Alfa Giulia is a fun car to drive. Has plenty of pickup. Using the paddle shifters is a blast. Car holds the road well and the cabin is comfortable.  However, I do wish I had purchased  the sport seats. Had the car for about 10 days and went on a road trip of 600 miles. Gas mileage was as advertised at 30-31 mpg. Ran it up to 110mph and it had a great deal more to give. The steering takes a little getting use to as it is so responsive. Have had numerous compliments.

I've now hat it a week and a half and it spent the first week in the shop with them no having a clue how to fix it.  They finally flew an engineer in to work on it.  It worked for a day and now works about 1/3 of the time.  I'm taking it back into the shop tomorrow.  So, on Friday I will have had the car for two weeks, but have only actually been in possession of the car for four days.  Alfa ""Premier Customer Care"" is zero help.  the dealership offered to find me a replacement but then they couldn't actually get one here.  There's one just like mine sitting on a lot two hours away and that dealership refused to release it to this dealership, and Alfa Romeo corporate can't do anything to make that happen.

alfa-romeo,giulia,2017,s.cassell@hotmail.com, 03/31/2017,Not the Alfa of old,5,"First take the car for a test drive, this is not a BMW, Mercedes or Audi, it was never meant to be.  This is Italian at its best.  Some reviews out there mention comparisons to the infotainment and lack of rear leg room however for myself it has been totally the fun and excitement to drive.  I will admit the rear leg room can be limited however, it is ample enough for short trips with people in the back seat.  This car is so much fun to drive, the pick up is great, the sound is intimidating, even for the 4 cyl.  having owned since the middle of the February I was one of the only ones in the area that had one.  this meant only 6 in the whole area.  It has a very sexy design and gives the driver that feeling of being a part of a specialized crowd.  I love it, although might not be for everyone, but it is definitely meant more many.

alfa-romeo,giulia,2017,Steve Meeks, 10/01/2017,A wolf in sheeps clothing,5,"The 2017 Giulia Quadrofogilio is a sleeper compared to BMW, Mercedes and even my Porsche 911 4s. I am baffled by some reviews from journalists in that I think that they have never driven the Quadrofogilio. 505 horsepower. 4 different driving modes including race, ceramic brakes and a carbon fiber driveshaft, roof and hood and movable front aero an interior that is far superior to BMW, Mercedes, Porsche or Jaguar. My son is 6ft tall and is more comfortable in the back seat than the BMW 3 series or the Jaguar xe or even the Mercedes 300. The infotainment and navigation is better than my Porsche which cost $160k. For a performance vehicle in a sedan who outperforms BMW, Jaguar, Mercedes, and handles as good or better than my 2017 Porsche 9114s for $80 k plus a warranty that is the best in the industry how can you not like the Italian design, handling, comfort and price.  This car looks like a regular family sedan but is built for the track. It is funny how BMW's , Mustangs, and even Corvettes, want to race you and you have the last laugh when you fly past them and they have a look of despair. Up date after 8000 miles no change its like a mad hornet on steroids. This car is amazing way under priced to compare to the competition,it is the fastest 4 door sedan out there today. No mechanical problems unlike the 2017 Porsche which had many electrical problems. Every time we drive the Giulia we all have smiles on our faces. We take long trips in this car and its very comfortable , my son is 6'ft tall and can fit comfortably in the back seat not so in the BMW, Mercedes, or Jaguar. If you don't buy this car at least drive it to see what you are missing.

alfa-romeo,giulia,2017,TXMB, 08/21/2018,Absolutely love it,5,"Had my 2017 Ti Sport since December of last year - absolutely love it.  I find excuses to take the car out to run errands or just to get behind the wheel and go for a ride.  I typically keep it in D mode since I enjoy the aggressiveness of the drive when you push the car.  N works well... not sure what the point is of A unless you're on a long drive.  As the driver, I appreciate the interior and the way it is set up.  It is simple and minimalistic and I appreciate that as I bought the car due to its performance and not because of its infotainment system.   Start/stop is annoying so I normally turn it off (I hate it in all cars) and the trunk is somewhat pointless.  Family seems comfortable enough but, in reality, I bought the car for me as a driver and as the main driver, I LOVE IT!  Have not had any reliability issues.

alfa-romeo,giulia,2017,Richard Lauricella, 10/12/2018,Beautiful design and fun to drive.,4,"The exterior design attracts many compliments. The interior is very nice with the Lusso package. The steering and handling are excellent and the power makes this a fun experience. Reliability was a concern when bought but everything has been fine. The biggest negatives are a clunky nav system and the lack of Android Auto Play.

There is a strange noise in the steering. The dealer ordered an electronic power steering gear box from Alfa in November 2018 which Alfa has not provided 6 months later. They say it is on back order. Very disappointing.

BMW just made a big mistake with the new 2015 M3/M4!!. cars sounds really really really bad!! the interior cheap, steering sucks, steering wheel also sucks, turbo lag, and bad handling, the only thing BMW did good on the new models is the reliability YES more reliable but SUBARU like cars. This Alfa is like driving V8 E92 M3 with all the stuff you wish if the V8 M3 had mostly POWER. If my E92 M3 had double the power it had I would've kept it for longer than 4.5 years but E92 had NO POWER and sounds sooooooo good!!. once you drive the Alfa you will forget about and German cars TRUST ME. if you don't take my word for it you will waste your money on anything you buy. enough said

alfa-romeo,giulia,2017,MB, 03/23/2018,BEST KEPT SECRET,5,"Car has been just a dream. Traded in BMW as they don't offer one at this price point that is anything but an economy car with a fancy badge. Once upon a time BMW was my go to car for a sporty but livable sedan. Truth is, they got soft. Alfa Romeo just knocked it out of the park. I almost don't want to write a review because I love that I don't see many on the road. Feels like a special car.

alfa-romeo,giulia,2017,Joshis, 06/28/2018,Dangerously moves to neutral gear while in drive.,1,"Purchased a 2017 Alfa Romeo Giulia in May 2017. After the initial and random dashboard warnings which would either resolve themselves or a dealer visit for updates, the vehicle started  moving to Neutral while in Drive around December 2017. After that it has happened numerous times once on highway at 70+MPH and multiple times while making left or right turns.
I have to instantly move the car to drive mode to avoid a collision with an incoming car at the intersection. What has followed in the past  few months is software updates, shifter change and brand new transmission but the critical issue remains.
No complaints with dealership as they are merely third party to this end. The service staff is courteous and has maintained good communication with us all the way.
But Alfa Romeo Corporate response is unbecoming of a premium brand. They moved our case to a Third Party Dispute Resolution Center, who offered us pennies as compensation for putting our lives at risk.
A better and smarter company would have seen the seriousness of the situation and quickly replaced it with a new tested vehicle with matching or upgraded features. But our patience and positive approach has been met with indifference and lack of sense if urgency.
We deeply regret buying this product from Alfa Romeo. As it stands today my garage is empty and I am paying on a loan  for a fruit."
alfa-romeo,giulia,2017,Gneo Pompeo, 12/08/2017,Best car I've ever owned,5,"This car has a soul. You just feel connected to the road, and the steering is so sharp.

"
alfa-romeo,giulia,2017,Cordog, 08/03/2017,Good but not great - Won't recommend to a friend,3,"I leased my Giulia about 1 month ago for 24 months and I am so glad I didn’t buy it. There are some really impressive things about the car. The performance/economy from the 2.0L intercooled/turbocharged engine; the handling, the sexy looks (I have metallic silver with red interior that really grabs attention). But, having lived with the car for about 700 miles, I already see things that make me glad I didn’t purchase this car. 
Performance/Mechanical: About that fuel economy… the trip computer on the instrument panel overestimates economy by about 7% (it says 33.5 MPG when it was really about 31.3 MPG). This isn’t that big a deal but my Mazda 3 (half this price) is within 0.2 MPG of reality. The sunroof on my car is currently inoperable. It did open once but now won't tilt, won't retract the interior screen back or anything. I’ve read one review where an online magazine said Alfa admits having some SW issues that contribute to engine and sunroof issues. The engine stop/start feature doesn’t have a hill holder so even on the slightest of inclines the car begins to roll backwards upon releasing the brake pedal – before the engine starts and engages transmission. That doesn’t happen in my BMW. Nice feature is the ability to lock the doors from the rear of the vehicle as you close the trunk (an extra button there). The engine has plenty of power, though when in advanced economy mode, if you punch the gas pedal while already rolling maybe 20 MPH, there is considerable lag until the car actually responds. I put the pedal to the floor and I have to believe it was a full second before the car accelerated at all. I’m not talking turbo lag here… I’m talking accelerator lag. The car just rolled along at the same speed for about 1 second before it even began to accelerate at all. Then it snapped our heads back and flew! Braking is sure footed and outstanding. One feels confident and in control – same with the steering for the most part. Suspension is the right blend of sportiness and softness such that you have confidence in control yet not too firm that the smallest bumps jar you. Transmission shifts seamlessly and almost imperceptibly. Alfa’s recommended service intervals are at 10,000 miles and they are now providing a free first service. So, with my 24 month, 20,000 mile lease, I won’t pay for anything except gas. A word of warning, they did tell me the first service would be $900 if it wasn’t free for me. That seems a little steep to change the oil and “check” things like tires, etc. 
Interior/Fit & Finish: The “B” pillar is very large and obtrusive and makes it difficult to do a head check over one’s left shoulder. All I see is B pillar and seat belt. Looking at my other vehicles (Kia, Nissan, Mazda, BMW), it seems this Alfa pillar juts out into the passenger compartment much further. Not sure if this is for the seat belt assembly but my other cars have adjustable height (this one doesn’t) and they do not protrude as much from the frame as this one. The main dial for the infotainment options is right near the shift selector and arm rest. It is VERY easy to tap this accidentally and that will create various distractions depending on which infotainment option you are currently using. For example, in Nav mode, it brings up the destination selection/cancel while in use. You then have to dismiss the route cancel by selecting again. Speaking of the Nav system… its’ pretty elementary. In fact, I compare it to a 2005 vintage Tom Tom system. While it boots up quickly, it takes a long time to replan routes (if you miss a turn, for example) and it seems to remain fixated on going the original way it wanted you to go even if, based on your missed turn, a new way is shorter. I have tried using “most economical”, “fastest” and “shortest” and I can’t make sense out of some of the routes it gives me. A route I travel frequently (having used Google
 maps and GPS within my other cars) resulted in this system continually trying to tell me to turn off the expressway I was on to take some other route. There is no shorter, faster or more economical route than what I was taking. I may drive that some weekend just to see where it wanted me to go but I sure can’t figure it out. Now I doubt it’s capabilities if I’m ever anywhere where I don’t really know what I’m doing. Also, I haven’t found a way to store a recent or current destination as a favorite. You have to enter each favorite in manually as if entering a destination. AC blows REALLY cold air and cools the car down fast! However, even on low speeds the fan noise is excessive – like a budget car. I expect more for north of $40K. I haven’t driven more than about 2 hours in any single day yet so I can’t really speak to long duration driving comfort but with the 8 way power driver and passenger seat, I expect a comfortable position can be maintained. The touch of the fabrics and the feel of the interior is as expected. Overall glad I'm leasing but will enjoy my 23 remaining months.

alfa-romeo,giulia,2017,disappointedOwner, 11/23/2017,Worst quality and warranty ever,1,"I have owned bmw 335i and audi q5(still owning it). This is first time owning an Italian car. In fact, I only have it for 6 and half days (only drove 160 miles), it broke. Two engine lights on. Brought to dealership and they refuse to cover it in warranty claiming that there is a wire chewed lose by rat and I have to pay for it! I have 2 other cars parking in the same parking lot/garage for past 4 years (still parking there every night) and never had a problem. This car sit in their parking lot for about 6 month (built in April 2017 and I bought it in mid Nov 2017) and sit in my parking lot/garage for only 6 nights, they blame on me for rat damage! Oh, another thing, on the day of delivery, the power seats wasn't working, but restart the car solved the issue. Unbelievable quality and unbelievable service. For luxury car, the most value the badge carries is the service. And Alfa Romeo failed on that. I deeply regret getting myself into this trouble. Luckily I only leased it for 27 month. Word of advice: stay away from it.

alfa-romeo,giulia,2017,"Mark ""Alfabeast"" Dobson", 05/11/2019,So far so good,5,"This is my 3rd Alfa, I had a 72 Spider and 74 GTV 2000. This car keeps the experience going in every way. Very nimble in the corners, fast when you want it to be, precise and light steering feel. Tons of comments from people and long stares from car guys! I have been lucky that all the electronics are working well and have only been in for a software upgrade and oil change. Will be buying it. Glad I got the sports seats - only way to go. Should have gotten the 19-in wheels, LSD and adaptive suspension but this one was on the lot. Service mgr said the 18-in wheel is good for every day driving to ward off pinch flats vs the 19. The RFT Bridgestones not my fav but they are about shot and I will go for P7's. Wheel upgrade to 19 is tempting and I can then have a winter and summer set of wheels/tires. Don't believe the Alfa bashers but at the same time there appear to be some that are plagued by electronic gremlins early in life.

alfa-romeo,giulia,2017,davidh, 09/05/2019,"""Inanimate objects can't make you happy?"" Hah!",5,"I've put nearly 25,000 miles on my 2017 Alfa Giulia TI now. It still puts a smile on my face every time I drive it. It's hard to arrive at the office without a smile on your face, and no matter how hard of a day I've had in the office, I always arrive home with a smile. 
I admit that I haven't driven the base Giulia so this review is strictly for the TI/Veloce version. I ordered mine with the basic interior and exterior (small screen, no fancy bodywork, standard seats, 18"" wheels, no sunroof) but I specified it with the Performance Package (Limited slip diff, adaptive suspension, paddle shifters). 
I've owned several Porsches, Mercedes Benzes, Jaguars, and a Lexus. The Alfa delivers the best all round balance of performance, luxury, and efficiency. Steering in this car is almost psychic. Chassis balance is nearly perfect and neutral all the way through. The car accelerates much quicker than the 280hp would make you think. Perhaps it's because of the lightweight aluminum body panels making this car quite the feather weight of its class. My only complaints are that brake pedal feel is a bit dull at low speeds (typical for brake by wire) and the turbo lag is noticeable under 1,500rpms. But flip the suspension dial to D (Dynamic) and the car will make anybody feel like Fangio. 
Reliability has been very good. I've had a minor rattle coming from the passenger area that the dealer can't find. Only noticeable over bumpy roads with stereo off so it's not a deal killer. Dealer also replaced the dashboard due to some stitching coming undone. Proximity sensor went a little whacky at one point but was quickly addressed with a software update. And finally, during a routine service interval, the dealer found a leak in the turbo coolant hose. Aside from these minor issues, the car has been rock solid and dead nuts reliable. 
Note that this is a driver's car. If you're looking for fancy tech in the infotainment system, you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for plush leather trim everywhere, you'll also be disappointed. Not that the interior is bad by any means (I mean, look at that beautiful steering wheel and start button!). But it's just not Mercedes level of luxury inside. That's not the point of the Giulia, it's a car that rewards you with an amazing driving experience each time. 
Don't believe me? Take one for a test drive....

Update: Now owning the Giulia Quadrifoglio for 2 years, I have to say it's still a fantastic car. With just over 50,000 miles on the odometer, I can only complain about squeaky brakes when they're cold. Other than that we love it so much we have also purchased a Stelvio and another family purchased a Ti Sport Giulia, making a total of 7 current Alfas in the family now.

July 2020 review. My Quad now has 74,458 flawless miles. I have only done the routine dealer recommended maintenance. I must say, after 3 years of ownership and nearly 75,000 miles, this car still puts a smile on my face every time I drive it! Our Stelvio Quad has been flawless as well. Out of the 7 total Alfas in our family, the only major issue has been one of the TI sport needed the passenger seat belt buckle replaced. Something made it trigger the air bag warning light. Warranty covered it with no hesitation. I am still 100% happy with my purchase!

After 4 bmws, 4 Mercedes, 3 Porsche’s, 5 AUDI’s— this is the most fun car in ages. Last 5 AUDI’s, great luxury, safety, marginal handling including last S6. Alfa is a joy to drive. It’s one of those ,”take the long way home cars.” Or let’s just take this drive to , “wherever” just “ because.” The AUDI has greatest info and technology ever, but I don’t drive the info screen. So for kicking back, cruising, sleepy drives- get the AUDI , MB, BMW. To DRIVE , Alfa has no competition. Finally; was concerned about reliability; 7,500 miles— just gas and air pressure checks; that’s it. Oh; and did I mention that grown , mature men just stop and drool over the thing; sometimes I embarrassingly have to squeeze through admirers  to get to the car and leave.

alfa-romeo,giulia,2018,SJMST, 01/26/2018,Review by Actual Owner,5,"I see a some reviews by people who decided not to buy. I did lease one, and here's what I think.
I have 3,500 miles of flawless performance on mine. 
 
This car turns heads. People stop to chat and ask about it. If you want to blend into the background, maybe it’s not the car for you. From every angle, it looks properly proportioned. The interior is beautiful, and is there a more striking logo than Alfa’s? I say “No”
Best for last. Driving it.  It’s not a weekend toy. I commute interstate, NY to NJ every day. Forty five miles each way. Hence the need for the adaptive cruise and forward collision warning. This allows the car to stop and go on its own in bumper to bumper traffic. Nice.
When the roads are open, and that happens even in NY, it is wonderful. The chassis feels carved from stone,  yet is somehow compliant over rough patches. It is inexplicably able to take curves flat at speed yet still be comfortable. This is not a big car. It is in looks and feel more like sports sedans before they became heavy and bloated. The Giulia is light and quick and instantly responsive. My 2002 BMW 3 series 5-speed was something like that, but this has that beat.

Get an Alfa.

This is a great small sedan, agile, comfortable, fast and beautiful. Best steering, shifting and suspension of any non sports car that I have owned. Flat out beats the 7 and 5 series BMWs I have owned as well as the Jaguar XKR, and MB E cars I have owned. One minor complaint- the front seat a bit to short but understandable from a design viewpoint.  Again, no mechanical issues at all. I love this car.

alfa-romeo,giulia,2018,Johno, 12/25/2018,Any Excuse to Drive,5,"I have passed 10K miles on the car with zero problems (other than a minor glitch with radio presets fixed with software update).  This is effectively a four door Ferrari for a remarkably reasonable price.  The acceleration and handling are nothing short of supercar stunning.  You look for any excuse to drive it: the most mundane errands are just a blast.  The comments and stares at every parking lot add to the exotic car ownership experience.  And yet the car is completely comfortable and civilized as an every day driver.  My spouse was an exec for a Japanese car company so I was spoiled with new primo quality cars every two years and we also have other Hondas, Nissan/Infiniti's and a Lexus in the family and the Alfa is every bit their equal in build quality, fit and finish.  And, oh by the way, the Montecarlo Blu on my Quadrifoglio has a depth and sparkle beyond any other blue that I've seen on any other car on the road -- again more like a super-exotic than others in the class, and the comments of strangers confirm this.  I had apprehensions because of the exaggerated unreliability reputation, the truth has been, instead, bulletproof to date.

alfa-romeo,giulia,2018,AlfaForever, 04/18/2018,Best Kept Secret,5,"Once you drive it, you will get out of the car handing your wallet and keys to your trade to the dealer as you will not possibly want to get back into your old car. My Giulia is my 15th car in 23 years.  I had been researching for months a replacement for my E350.  I have had all the Germans and a few Asian cars along the way, nothing like my Alfa.  It goes like hell, turn the wheel and it follow your lead.  So much power, yet very efficient.  My local dealer was running great lease deals and until the Alfa I have not ever leased. Went to the dealer late on a Saturday night and drove the Giuila and Stelvio back to back, it was game over. I don't recall the last car I had that was so much fun to drive. I also love that it is unique and few others have them.  Also appreciate that with a couple of packages it as all I need and the standards list is long.  It has leather seats for example that so many of the competing cars offer at a hefty cost if at all. I am also a big guy over 6' and have ample legroom and am very comfortable inside. Within a week, my huge panoramic moonroof decided it was not going to open anymore.  Took a week to get appointment at the dealer.  The dealer does not offer loaners which made me apprehensive but they made the repair and had me on my way in a couple of hours with a wash.  Few weeks back, went to leave in the morning and the trunk would not even open, the car was dead.  Alfa customer service was very nice, tow truck came and jumped the car.  I have not ever had to call roadside let alone be stranded by a car and was very angry about it.  Headed to the dealer, they could not find anything wrong, washed the car and had me on the way.  As soon as I opened the roof and got some music going on the fantastic Harman Kardon system, I could not stop smiling.  The car is quirky but has so much character.  The Mercedes dealer where my last car was serviced was so nice, fantastic service, appointments within hours as needed, free loaners and free car washes 5 days a week.  The Alfa dealer is nowhere near that caliber but they are trying very hard and it is evident those who work there are passionate about the cars.  If in the market for a sport sedan or SUV, go drive the Alfas, you will not be disappointed.
"
alfa-romeo,giulia,2018,Bob, 01/30/2019,Owner for just over a year,5,"I love to drive this car!  I live over 300 miles from the dealer so I was really nervous to buy and be stuck so far away from qualified help. I have not been disappointed. First the warranty allows for towing from anywhere for the first 40K miles. So there is peace of mind right away, but I have not needed it.  There have been 2 or 3 minor recalls, I would expect some given the new platform.  And they have been handled at my convenience and  taking the car to the dealer is a fun drive.  The car handles and hugs the ground,  flat cornering at speeds no other car I've owned could deal with.  Reliable fun to drive and safe.
UPDATE 2/2020 Still love this car a joy to drive and no reliability problems.  I have just over 20K miles.

alfa-romeo,giulia,2018,Maupiti, 01/26/2018,Amazing vehicle,5,"I compared my loaded Giulia Ti Sport with other sports sedan I owned and recently test drove (Audi A4 and BMW 3 series, Maserati Ghibli). The Giulia gives a different feeling when you drive it and everyone obviously is highlighting the driving dynamics and the handling of this vehicle, but I want to stress its engineering and its quality control, that are usually exposed to old cliche' from people who actually nevere owned an Alfa or maybe had a bad experience back in the '80 so are not updated at all. The Giulia has a brand new engineering and platform and doesn't share anything from Fiat/Chrysler group. A profusion of aluminum and carbon fiber is used throughout the vehicle and the engine, steering and trasmission are a masterpiece. This, added to the racing expertise of both Alfa and Ferrari combined in this new project, reflects how wonderful is Giulia in and out. The seductive exterior design and the driving pleasure are both taken for granted by now (considered the best looking sedan with the best handling in the market) so I want to describe its quality: the interior is refined with the Luxury package added. Fit and finish is perfect, no noises coming out during the ride and the parts assembly is very accurate. Reliability has been incredible so far, not a single issue (even beating my Subaru which had a minor issue right after the purchase and a few annoyances during the time I owned it. The glitches reported on some of the earlier test models have been resolved by software updates few months ago and I purchased mine already with the SW update. In my ownership experience so far I can say that it is the best sports luxury sedan I've ever had and everytime I take it for a ride is a big pleasure for me! One last suggestion for interested buyers: pick a Ti Sport with full leather package and 19"" rims. The exterior and interior style and feeling improve a lot!
Finally, I wanted to address the negative ""predicted"" reliability that some automotive magazine and blogs like CR are always mentioning: I suggest to keep current and have a look at what is actually going on with updated surveys in Europe, where Alfa Romeo has been present continously, and actual consumer ratings, not to mention the Motortrend and Car and Driver most recent tests that lead to awards:

alfa-romeo,giulia,2018,Fred deNapoli, 12/17/2018,Breakthrough!,5,"If Ferrari were to build a 4 door sedan, it would be much like this car.  This new generation of ALFA sedans is that good.  As a die-hard BMW enthusiasts for over 30 years, a former BMWCCA club racer, PCA National Instructor Corp member, I've been around the block a few times.  There is not another mass produced sedan in the world I'd trade for my Quadrofolio, period.  Not only does it have a 500+hp Ferrari engine, world class and dynamically adjustable chassis and suspension, killer brakes, a largely carbon fibre body, Ferrari paddle shifters, but an articulating front spoiler (another first in a road car) that all combine to literally run circles around the competition.  But the best part, by far, has been largely overlooked by critics and public alike: balance and steering.  The car's light weight makes it feel super agile...plus, with the engine well back in the car it's blessed with an enviable fore and aft weight distribution.  Anyone coming from say an S4 will find this an epiphany and you may well hear a chorus of angels at your first entry into a bend at speed.  But still the best is saved for last.  The steering rack, straight out of a Ferrari 458 Italia, is nearly 40% faster than any production sedan.  You simply look into a corner and this four door, 5 passenger Ducati just carves effortlessly following your line of sight with remarkably little steering input.  THIS will be the most memorable characteristic of this remarkable vehicle long after the spine pinning, soul crushing acceleration runs up through the gears have become routine.  If you want the best sedan on the planet, go test drive one.  But be careful, this thing is pure, uncut, automotive crack.

alfa-romeo,giulia,2018,Dude11, 03/26/2019,Great Car!,5,"Waited for the 2018 model year came out.  Not a single issue with the car ever.  My car is used heavily for work.  I have had it for a year now and it has 27,000 miles on it.  The AWD handles great during inclimate weather.  Only real complaints are the seats get a little uncomfortable during my long trips between Illinois and Tennessee and the trunk space can be a little challenging.
"
alfa-romeo,giulia,2018,Burt De Mill, 05/20/2019,A Sedan for those that still love to drive!,4,"Tremendous style and performance for the price point! Some early '17 models had numerous software bugs that seem to have been ironed out in my '18. A car that enthusiasts (the few of us left) can enjoy. Crisp handling, strong low end torque, great brakes, pulls hard for a turbo four. Not for the Camry fan; it's not about trunk size, cup holders, or video game size display screens. But for those that still love to drive, it ranks very high on my list, and I've been fortunate enough to drive some terrific performance cars over the years. Some hard, cheap plastics in the interior (Alfa, upgrade the shifter and backup camera please)  At $43,000 out the door, the best car bargain I've come across. Much more personality and character than my previous C300 and BMW 335i, and still rare even in Southern California.  If grabbing the keys on a sunny day and cruising down a country road with some Italian flair appeals to you, this is your car!
"
alfa-romeo,giulia,2018,DaveK, 03/27/2019,Drives great - zero issues!,5,"I knew the car was an amazing drive right away. I drove it right after a 328i and the difference was night and day. But I was terrified about the reputation of Italian cars. But I sorta ""had to have that car"" so I got a 2 year lease and held my breath. A year in, I have been plesently surprised. It is a normal newish car. Nothing has broken, nothing squeaks or rattles, the adaptive cruise control works as I would expect in an Audi or BMW and it still looks and drives great. Style isn't free and the backseat and trunk are smaller than competitors but the leather covered dash and open grain wood are to die for. And the thing drives like mad. I love this car.
"
alfa-romeo,giulia,2018,Jack, 07/04/2018,Love this car!,4,"Had an initial problem with the turbo (replaced), but the dealer was fantastic and provided me with a brand new Mercedes GLC300 as a free loaner.  The last 7000 miles have been flawless  (9000 overall).  It's my second Alfa and being Italian, reliability issues are expected.  I will say this though, my wife's Mercedes has had five service trips in the first 20k miles, including four recalls and brakes replaced under warranty.  From my experience, the Mercedes has been less reliable than the Alfa.  I read an earlier post about the sunroof, mine has stopped several times but is easily fixed...the fix is easily found online and takes about a minute to reset.  I love the car and will get another Alfa when the lease expires.
"
alfa-romeo,giulia,2018,John E, 06/14/2019,Best car in segment. home run!,5,"I am a bit of a sports sedan junkie.  I have own many cars in this segment (BMW 3 series and M3, Audi A4 and S4, C class)  over the past 15 or so years. Though I have only owned my Giulia Ti for less than two years, I think it's safe to say that it is the best performing and most reliable car I've owned. The only problem I experienced was the infotainment system being a little slow when i first purchase it. The dealer updated the firmware and its been great ever since. Every other car I have owned (all but one purchased new) had at least one or more mechanical or electrical issues by the 2 year mark.  I leased mine to be on the safe side but I am fairly confident I will be buying the Quadrifoglio when my lease expires. Alfa Romeo has made a believer out of me.
"
alfa-romeo,giulia,2018,Armilano, 06/21/2019,In love!,5,"Being an Alfisti for over 20 years, I couldn’t wait until Alfa came back to the US. And boy did that hit a grand slam! I know I am biased to Alfa but I genuinely can’t find anything wrong with this car. The looks! Men women and children all stop to look and ask about it. I have a Misano Blue ti and it turns heads daily. The engine and tranny are perfectly matched! The ZF 8 Speed took some getting used to but now I am in heaven with it. The handling is superb, period. I have the Q4 and it performed great in our rough PA winters. I let a few friends of mine that owned a performance car shop drive it and they were blown away by the bang for the buck. They are German and Japanese car specialists and were convinced the Alfa Giulia is the steal of the century. My wife is sold too, she now has her heart set on a Stelvio. If driving dynamics is your first priority than look no further than the Giulia. Test drive the competition first and I guarantee you will agree the Alfa is far superior. The back seats are a bit tight, no biggie for me. There are a few rattles on the interior, I just don’t care! The driving experience is just that good. Gas mileage is as expected for such vehicle. Although I always have mine in Dynamic mode. Reliability has been fine, zero issues. If you are considering a Bimmer, Benz, Caddy, Acura or Lexus, give Alfa a test drive. You won’t regret it!
"
alfa-romeo,giulia,2018,Supersix, 05/03/2019,Fantastic Car,5,"Have had my Misano Blue Giulia for 3 months.  Still find myself glancing back at it.  No issues what so ever. Car is a joy to drive.  It eats up the miles on longer trips.  Quiet, fast, fun, efficient.  Does it all.  Back seat is tight, and larger types might not be comfortable in sport seats.  Front is very low to the ground.  Great care must be exercised around curbs and steep approaches.  Great build quality.  Interior is probably not up to German standards, but everything works like it should, and in the background.  Came out of a BMW 135 is. The Alfa runs circles around the BMW in the handling department, and is nearly as quick.  Feels like much more than 280 horsepower.  All in all very happy so far with the car.

Update.   10/18/19.

Car has been flawless, and continues to put a smile on my face every time I drive it.

alfa-romeo,giulia,2018,AlfaOut, 03/27/2018,"The Good, the Bad, the Alfa",3,"If you want a flat-out sports sedan, and worry about nothing else, this is 100% the car for you.  It will drive better than anything else out there.  However, if you want something you can drive daily and not have to worry about breaking down, then this is not the car for you.  Here are the pro and cons: Pros: Best handling.  Period.  Cons: electrical controls will intermittently work and/or not work.  The vehicle is missing sensors.  There is an intermittent smell of something burning--burning oil and/or rubber smell.  This is either not found by the dealer, and/or a dealer will tell you ""something"" needs to burn off.  There is a warranty--great, but when the electronics and burning smell appear, the dealer AND Alfa itself has no idea (or flat-out-lies).  The warranty therefore is useless.  They will try to fix it, but either not find a problem because it's intermittent, not find it, or claim it ""may"" be working as designed, manual and common sense to the contrary.   Overall, a great car, but not ready for ""show-time.""  The dealer network is deficient, poorly-trained, and Alfa itself is clueless.  The driving dynamics are not soo great or that much better than a BMW, Audi, or Jag to warrant buying/leasing this vehicle.

alfa-romeo,giulia,2018,Davey, 07/14/2018,"No problems, drives amazing, looks great",5,"I'll keep it short. I loved the car when I drove it and was terrified of reliability. So I got a short (24 month) lease. I've got 3K miles and the car has been flawless. Solid, fast and quiet. Not a squeak, smell or rattle. I know 3K is still early but I have been reassured that there haven't been ""little"" issues that might be leading indicators of future bigger problems. Beyond that the car is a joy to drive and so fun to be around. My neighbors think its exotic and wonder if I won the lottery (they have no idea that my lease is in Honda Accord range). Downsides? The non-sport seats are a bit unsupportive and the navigation is outdated (so I use Google Maps via Android Auto). Other than nav the infotainment isn't bad (although Audi is better). Sensor features like adaptive cruise control are surprisingly good (I sort of figured Alfa wouldn't do that well). Front collision sensor is a little too sensitive but that's minor. Net-net I love this car and feel like I discovered this brilliant secret.

alfa-romeo,giulia,2018,A.S., 12/02/2018,"Great looks good performance and handling, BUT...",3,"People admire the car's looks; I like its performance, handling, acceleration, braking..and style BUT the car has assorted technical flaws/obsolete features -- for example,  memory doesn't control mirrors; auto-brights don't work; camera is low resolution, poor contrast, image too small. The WORST is the lack of integrity of the body -- the front bumper disengaged -- Alfa Customer Service insisted that scratches on the bottom (it's a low car) voided any warranty; I discovered my friend has the same problem.  If anyone reading this has the same problem, please email me at as1947mail@gmail.com   Customer service treated me so shabbily that i will likely seek to file a class action suit.  I had bumper re-done at my expense (Alfa would not pay) and affixed it properly and adequately.  Think long and hard before you buy or lease this vehicle, and don't rely on Customer Service. it is a sham.  At least now, I have the front bumper property and securely affixed, no thanks to Alfa which pretends the defect doesn't exist.

I would say if you own a Quadrifoglio you would agree that it feels more like a $200,000 car than an $85,000 car. I have Porsche owners come up to me and surprisingly tell me that the q.v. is faster than their Porsche. Not the 911 turbo of course. It eats M3s, AMGs and just about every other car you would see in a normal everyday drive. There is absolutely not a single car that could match the performance of the Alfa and still cost less than $150k. Molto bene! If your looking for an actual engine performance car then there is nothing close. Is the interior as nice as a Bentley?  No. Does it handle good in snow? No. But niether does 99% of the cars that are sub 4 seconds 0-60. It’s got 510 HP...Why is Alfa being judged harshly to such a high standard when BMW and Mercedes have had a 30 year head start and just got punked in Alfa’s first production of saloon cars?

alfa-romeo,giulia,2018,Regina D, 12/20/2019,Car Enthusiast can only say WOW!!!,5,"My passion is cars and I love German engineering.  However I did stray try Range Rover, great cabin and Lexus IS350 is a true delight.  But in the end, I went back to what I love.  In 2018 the Giuilia caught my eye.  I thought, now isn't this one sexy beast?  I took the Sport Ti AWD for a test drive and immediately I fell in love.  I could not get over how well the car handled or how it went for 0 to 60 in the blink of an eye.  For the 1st time, I felt invincible on the road (I know, ridiculous statement, but it's nonetheless true)  I remember getting out of the car, thinking ""how is this possible?""  This is not a German car, I don't understand.  This new Italian car just rocked my world.  I knew right there an then, this would be mine.  I've had the car now 21 months, and I can tell you every single time I turn the engine on, my heart skips a beat.  I get excited every time I see her.  She handles like no other car I've ever driven.  Hands down the most comfortable seats.  Oh, and she is one beautiful car and turns heads everywhere it goes.  I refer to my Giulia as the poor man's Maserati, because the car is just that good.  

There is only 1 complaint, and that is the infotainment.  It shuts down without warning and you loose your Car Apple Play.  As much as I do not like this flaw, it doesn't change my love for the car.  My lease is up in 2 months, and I will upgrade to another Giulia Sport Ti AWD.  I seriously LOVE this car.  Please note, the Giulia was my 18th brand new car in 36 yrs of driving, and this is the 1st time I will trade in for the same exact vehicle, right down to the color volcano black.  Black on black with red calipers, because one does need a pop of color.

If you have a passion for cars, please take the car for a test drive, just to see what I am talking about.  I promise you, it will WOW you.

alfa-romeo,giulia,2018,George, 04/07/2020,Just fabulous,5,"I bought my totally loaded 2018 Lusso used, and I have about 8000 miles on it, 17,500 total. Best car I ever owned, including Mercedes, Jaguar, and a pretty great Sterling 827 SLI manual (how’s that for a rarity). The looks, handling, power, transmission and interior are without peer. The interior approach, which locates the screen within the flowing dashboard, eliminating the rectangular blob in the center of the car, is the best styling approach I have seen. The car is not without some issues, mainly needing periodic software updates (why can’t everyone follow Tesla‘s lead and do over the air software updates?). Also, I’m not fond of the runflat tires and no spare, which seem to be the modern trend. I will be replacing them with regular tires and a flat kit as soon as they wear out. I have driven and number of the Alfa models, and I should be clear: the TI Lusso model with the optional dynamic packages is the sweet spot. It includes a wonderful interior if the right color combination is selected, better leather for the seats,  leather dash and top of door panels and 18” tires - the 19” tires on the sport model will have too many flats and too harsh a ride. And the trunk is pretty narrow and not terribly accommodating. But I do have the advantage of a terrific dealership in White Plains, New York. All that said, the power, responsiveness, handling and the spectacular exterior and interior make for a most enjoyable ride.

alfa-romeo,giulia,2018,M Pechette, 01/14/2018,Not ready to give it a chance,4,"I was comparing to an Audi A4. I have had 3 A4 over the last 10 years and they have been practically trouble free. The Giulia is a delight to drive and has more unique styling than most cars on the road. It handles very well and is exciting to drive. But I each of the Giulia's I test drove (drove 3 different cars over 2 months)had some glitch that the salesman said just needed a software update. Why would you have any new car on your lot that needs an update? Nevertheless, I would have given it a fling if the dealer had been more aggressive on price. Ultimately, given the uncertain maintenance outlook, I was not going to pay a premium for the Giulia. And my Audi dealer made a great deal to keep me loyal, so I have my 4th A4.

The only other item I don't care for is the gas gage it's a ""line"" with gas amount symbols next to it and it's not every large. My wife drives the car every day and she has no complaints she likes the car over the BMW or the MB 300 we had. The select drive is great the vehicle has fast response time I would dare to say the handling is up there with my 2011 grand sport corvette. The car handles in the snow great . The rear seating area is small but I don't care I don't sat back there. Overall the car was 2 grand more than a Chevy Malibu LT we looked at and that was a no brainer folks. Car has had one recall no big deal software problem. I have no problem making my payment every month for this vehicle very pleased. We live in the woods in upstate N.Y. so we have to drive everywhere and we have no after toughs about this car.

alfa-romeo,giulia,2019,Billyp, 08/13/2019,A Fantastic Machine with Compromise,5,"Coming from a long line of BMW cars from basic 3 series to the M and X vehicles with an Audi thrown in here and there, this is a welcome change. I am a spirited driver that appreciates handling and feel as much as acceleration. The Alfa has so much that you can not put on paper. This is my favorite car that I have personally owned. It really is pretty too. People stop me at gas stations and coffee shops to ask me what it is.
The good: 
performance for the money. Porsche level steering in a mid level sedan. 
The not so good: 
Uncertain reliability long term. (So I leased it) 
Interior and tech is not quite up to audi and BMW,but with Carplay and Android auto, who cares. 

If you are looking for a sporty sedan that leans more towards the sporty side than the competition, you need to test drive one.

Had to run more than 9 times for servicing, every single time it was a different issue. The front lip was not going up, noise from the interior, electrical problems, and keeps going.

alfa-romeo,giulia,2019,JRDCIO, 01/08/2020,Like something Different,5,"I've owned 6 SAABs in my life.  Three were convertibles.  I was looking for something different instead of the all too common BMWs and Volvos.  I found it in the 2019 Alpha Romeo Giulia Ti Lusso.  Lots of power in its best-of-breed aluminum 280 HP engine.  Styling is the best Italian designers can offer.  Price was reasonable with significant discounting.  I was willing to take a chance.  Closest dealer is 2 1/2 hours from me, lots of feedback that reliability was not that good and I was not sure that Alpha Romeo would have the patience to stick it out in the States.This is why I signed a 2 year + lease.  I am delighted that I took a chance.  Car is fabulous! The features offer most of the current creature comforts and advanced safety features.  Next year's offerings will have even more.  Fit and finish rivals the best of vehicles offered in this entry level luxury sedan segment with a lot more pizzaz.  I hope I continue to say this through the end of lease.  Because I do not want to get just another postage stamp BMW that everybody has.

Looks great, drives like a dream, point and steer, gets up and runs like a cat.
What did they miss? Germans win on interior. Brake is a bit unpredictable but tolerable. Back up camera weak. Short on storage. 
It’s an Alfa, not a hotel so all the shortcomings dwindle because it drives like a dream. Most fun I have had with a car in decades.

alfa-romeo,giulia,2019,DWAinFL, 10/31/2019,The most AWESOME car I've ever purchased!,5,"Most of my life I've been a ""truck"" guy and I really wanted something sporty and fast. When I saw that Alfa Romeo was coming back to the North American market I started looking - and finally got one in September 2019. This car is a dream to drive. It is simple in style and form and in the cockpit you feel like you are not overwhelmed with flashy buttons and unnecessary gadgets. It took about 3 months of research before finding the perfect Giulia for me.  This car handles like a sports car but it is insured as a sedan.  I got an incredible deal as they are closing out the 2019s in prep for the 2020s plus FCA is giving some big rebates too.  My car came with the 22U package, Driver assistance static package, Nero Edizione (black edition), Harman Kardon audio, offset wheels/tires and wrapped up in a beautiful vesuvio gray exterior paint and black & tan interior.  I love everything about this car and look forward to taking it out for a drive, for absolutely no reason. BTW - I did compare other cars in this same class of vehicle and kept coming back to the Giulia. My only hope is Alfa Romeo will do better marketing to get more people behind the wheel of this wonderful car.  It would be a shame if this falls short and such a beautiful car is pulled from the North American market.

alfa-romeo,giulia,2019,Bundy26, 03/30/2020,Awesome drivers car so far,4,"I purchased this vehicle preowned 3 weeks ago with 22k miles and for the short amount of time I've driven it I love it. The exterior design is beautiful and flawless. While the interior is not up to par with the mainstream germans in quality the design is is beautiful and simple. The infotainment screen is easy to operate via the drive knob in the center console but again is not quite as good as the germans. 
Where this car shines imo besides the design is it's driving and handling. I come from years of fwd vehicles that now feel like they have no soul. The steering is better than BMW and MB (3 series and C class respectively). It makes you want to turn into corners a bit harder than you would do with other sedans in its category. Acceleration is great specially in D (dynamic) mode. I've been driving it constantly since my purchase in A (advance efficiency) and it's as calm as they come, but today I decided to do some spirited driving in dynamic mode and it did not disappoint one bit. 
I even got a bit tail happy but the AWD corrected that behavior. 
To end I have to say that this car might not be up there with the more established germans in build quality and engine refinement but it's an awesome daily driver that will have you waiting for the next driving session thanks to it's great chassis, engine and great looks.

alfa-romeo,giulia,2019,Ringo Davis , 08/23/2020,Best Car I've ever owned.,5,"First a little background. I've been driving Mercedes for over 15 years. CLK convertibles and then the E class convertible. Both far more expensive cars than the Giulia. The Giulia is hands down the most fun car to drive I've ever owned. I finally decided to break away from Mercedes for two reasons. One, the new Mercedes models were ugly and expensive. And two I was looking for something exciting and new, a young man's car rather than something for a Beverly Hills silver fox. I started my quest with Lexus but after sitting in the car for 10 minutes I had such a horrible headache from the off-gassing of toxic interior fumes that I decided not to test drive the car. Even the new Mercedes cars are on the toxic side but the smell tends to fade after three or four months. My wife drives a VW and the toxic smell lasts well into three years, totally disgusting. In stark contrast, The Giulia ""new car smell"" is rich leather, no bullshit cancer causing Formaldehyde adhesives at all. Apparently Italians actually care enough to not give their customers cancer!  The car is peppy and the steering is tight. Gas milage sucks and is way lower than stated but no news there, all brands have the same issue when it comes  to overstating miles to gallon. If you want a fun fast car for a far better value than Mercedes, BMW or Lexus than this is your ride! My only wish is that Alfa will get around to producing a coupe 2 door version of the Giulia. I've never been much of a sedan guy but i made awn exception for this one.

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2018,K Cope, 10/17/2018,"It is a driver's car, plain and simple",5,"There are more comfortable cars, ones with fancier interiors, and some with tons of high tech gadgets, but nothing under $75,000 drives like my Stelvio Ti Sport.   I have owned sports cars as well as high end luxury sedans, and this is a perfect meld of the two.  There has never been a car I owned which put a smile on my face and made me want to come up with excuses for which to drive.  (Well, perhaps my Shelby Mustang GT350 . . . )  Whipping up and down through the gears with the paddle shifters on a twisty road while the car gurgles and pops is an absolute blast.  I also considered the Jaguar E Pace and Porsche Macan, but to get the sports car experience you need to upgrade to larger engine sizes and much more expensive trim levels.  (For the record, like both the Jag and Porsche very much)  To date, I have had the car for two years, put 25,000 smile-filled miles on it, and have only minor problems which were quickly addressed by the dealership.  I got a 10 year/125k mile warranty at a reasonable price when I bought it, so should not have too much to worry about for the next decade, other than replacing tires and paying off speeding tickets.

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2018,Lloyd, 04/29/2018,Alfa is here to stay-a blast to drive,5,"Alfa Romeo has hit a home run with both the Stelvio and Giulia. I was going to lease another BMW 3 series x drive but the salesman was so pushy and annoying I decided to give Alfa Romeo a look. I was impressed with the looks of the Stelvio. A few days before I had test driven the Lexus NX 300 and while it drove OK I did not like the looks of the front grill-big mistake on Lexus' part. I leased a Stelvio, with Navigation--The vehicle comes with a lot of standard features and is priced well. Simply put, it handles great. It is fast and has no body lean on the turns. The breaking is a tad too responsive so it takes a bit of getting used to but this is a minor quibble. The steering is sharp, precise and smooth. I am glad I got out of the BMW as the Stelvio seats are way more comfortable. Also, the front cabin is roomy and has great headroom. My only complaint with the vehicle so far is that the radio has only 7 presets and the Satellite radio does not maintain the group of channels when one station is selected. I will give a nod to the BMW radio setup in that if I was listening to the comedy channels on the Satellite radio, the screen would maintain those channels so I could switch back and forth easily--the Stelvio only has one station listed and defaults back to the beginning if you want to browse through the stations. Otherwise, it is better in every respect and is a joy to drive. I took the car in for a service check and got the Giulia as a loaner. It too handles unbelievably well. It accelerates with no effort. It is makes driving fun again and I would have been happy if I had leased this car--I highly recommend either car and they price out very well compared to the competition. Bravo ALFA
"
alfa-romeo,stelvio,2018,Craig Rosen, 08/15/2018,Know your priorities,4,"I leased a Stelvio Ti and have a mixed bag of thoughts.  The best are the drive and the look.  Taste is relative but the body of the car, to me, is really beautiful.  It looks like the Italian sports SUV that it is.  It might be a little ostentatious but that’s for the individual to decide. 

The drive is great as most people mention. If you take a test drive make sure you get on a highway so you can fully appreciate the car.  It’s fast and handles beautifully— it’s a car for people that like to drive. 

The tech and materials are poor. The infotainment system is so outdated.  It isn’t touchscreen (neither is BMW) but the graphics are abysmal. They equate to a Space Invaders game from the 1970s.  The nav system does not display traffic patterns on the map (roads displayed in green, yellow, red depending by upon traffic) and although the display is integrated into the car’s design well, is really small.  Make sure you get a model manufactured recently and integrate Apple Carplay. It is not a luxury in this car, it’s a necessity if you use your GPS a lot. The system also requires a lot of steps for the most basic radio functions (like changing stations). It’s annoying.  

The base radio is really flat. It’s up to you to upgrade, for $1000, to a better stereo.  I didn’t.  Even if you’re not an audiophile you’ll hear the difference. 

The Ti, which I have, has comfortable seats. I found the Ti Sport to be too stiff and a really hard drive. The seat bolsters may hug you like a sports car, but I found them uncomfortable.  This is personal preference.  

All in all I love the look and the drive.  You can get a great deal on them (more than 20% off) but watch out for old stock (there were also recalls, but the old stock should have been fixed).  Really know your priorities- if gadgets are your thing then stay away.  If driving is your thing don’t think twice about the car.  Great price for a cool but flawed car. "
alfa-romeo,stelvio,2018,Morgan, 02/08/2018,Fast if you are into that type of thing,5,"This is a great driving SUV.  It feels like driving a sports sedan but has more trunk space and sits up higher.  It is fast and fun to drive.  It doesn't take bumps as kindly as typical SUV, but then again if you wanted a typical SUV then you wouldn't buy this car.   I wanted a sports car and my wife wanted an SUV.  This has been a great compromise, especially because it handles the potholes here in the northeast WAY better than our Mercedes sedan did.   General drawbacks - Some features feel a bit cheap in a way Mercedes would never have skimped.  Specific drawbacks 1. some nobs feel cheap 2. heat seats are more like seat warmers, not hot or fast. 3 back up camera feels pretty 2012 not 2017 4. parking sensors are a bit sluggish and not as accurate as I would like.  Overall this car is a beast and I love it.
"
alfa-romeo,stelvio,2018,H. Meltzer, 10/01/2017,The New Stelvio,5,"I've had the car for two weeks now and, so far, I am very satisfyed.  It is a very good looking and handling car.  The interior is not full of bells and whistles, which I like.  Not a lot of buttons.  Everything is logically layed out.  Comfortable seats and a comfortable ride which could be turned into a sporty ride with the turn of a knob.  Some nitpicks: There are only 7 presets on the radio - in total.  My last car had over 20 presets.  The voice activation does not work for the phone.  It seems that the early batches of Stelvios do not come equiped with Apply Play or Android.  All phone calls have to be made manually - not through any voice activation.  I called Alfa Romeo to ask if when the software became available, would I be able to download it onto my car.  They didn't know, so, my feeling is that I won't be able to.  Not happy about that.  The view out of the back is a bit limited but that is not surprising as the ""swooping"" design of the rear of the car is one of the things I liked about it.  Because of this, the safety package is something you should consider.  The dashboard view of the backup camera should be larger and it seems that it should be a bit brighter or have a higher resolution.  Again, these are some nitpicks on a SUV that I am very happy with.

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2018,Woody, 12/07/2017,Passionate SUV/CUV - One drive is all it takes! 44,5,"Update 6/2020: 44K in still totally enjoying our Stelvio. Other than normal recalls (handled very well by the dealer including loaners if appropriate + for routine maintenance), it has been perfect and is aging very well. Size, handling and more. I smile every time I see it sparkling in a parking lot or get behind the wheel.
(original comment:) Loyal to Jeep, we found the new GC too big; Cherokee too many compromises-- Stelvio PERFECT for our family. We were ready to pull the trigger on an XC60 but when we looked into the Stelvio, it checked off all of the boxes for both of us in terms of luxury, performance, and ride/features both right-brain and left-brain. Carve a few curves in Dynamic mode and you'll see why! Stelvio is well-equipped out of the wrapper and obviously designed with attention to detail and elegant engineering, yet full of 'surprise and delight' features- example memory seats, theater lighting, alarm system, puddle lights, , auto climate (nice, quiet, unobtrusive fan), 290 hp, AWD and more. I appreciated that you aren't forced into lots of expensive packages to get the few things you want. She loves the understated luxury and we both flipped for the rich chocolate brown interior.  Interior room within inches of XC60 (actually larger cargo area). The joy of ownership to me is more than contrived and emotionless design- this vehicle is truly art in motion and a beautifully and elegantly designed machine!
12/19 update: 40K miles and no regrets... Still delights the senses in the garage, parking lot, and especially on the road. No issues to speak of great mileage when she purrs and performance when she growls. We enjoy the individuality too and have since added a 500C to our fleet, going Italian all the way. For us Stelvio is the optimum vehicle.

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2018,LeeF, 03/09/2018,a driver's compact SUV,4,"I read just about every review I could find on the Stelio. The I test drove it 2 times. For the most part, I agree with most of the critics: as far as SUVs go, this thing is a blast to drive (I moved from an Audi A3 and A4), with the ground clearance that makes you not have to worry about dragging on that curb or speed bump.  My fear is that Fiat Chrysler may have made an error by picking a Ferrari guy for this project.  What I mean is, to make a best selling SUV (which I understand to have been their goal) you probably need to prioritize things like space, back seat room, luxe finishes, the latest tech, etc.  Only car guys care that they're driving a 2 liter aluminum engine with a carbon fiber drive shaft for under $50K!  My priorities were probably more aligned with those engineers, which is why I decided to go with the Stelvio.  I wanted a great handling SUV (for ground clearance and better visibility) with a great sounding stereo (I think the Harmon Kardon premium system beats my Audi's Bang & Olufsen premium sound in the Audi).  My 2 small dogs typically occupy the back seat and the not-so-huge trunk passed the Costco test last weekend when we bought toilet paper, paper towels, water softener and various groceries that all fit in the back!   Admittedly, it does not have the room or the sweet note of the supercharged V6 in the Jaguar F-Pace ($20-$30K more) and I have not driven the Porsche Macan because it $30K more (similarly equipped).  My vehicle was loaded with just about every option and in the TiSport trim but was discounted almost $10K below MSRP (to around $43K).  For that price, it was a no brainer!

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2018,TAF, 12/19/2018,180 day review,3,"I have owned my Stelvio since June. Fantastic car to drive - engine, transmission and steering are great.  The interior and technology is second rate.  The seats have limited positions so any day of 3+ hours of driving is gonna hurt.  My wife has an F-Pace and the cabin is far more sophisticated (and even that is not best in class). Stelvio stereo upgrade ( Harmon) is only average. Unfortunately, I was sold by local dealer that infotainment upgrade on my vehicle was imminent- doesn’t look like that is happening which is very disappointing.  Overall, was looking for something fun to drive and unique.  The car checks  those boxes.  If you are looking for high end comfort, sophistication and refinement -this is not your answer.

I am really enjoying this SUV like no other, it performs like a sports car, and rides like a luxury sedan.  Never thought I would own an Alpha Romeo, but they really did their home work on these vehicles.  I still have a 9-11 Porsche and have owned a couple of them over the past 18 years, this vehicle may be more fun than driving the Porsche, I'm torn on this one, it is that good.  If any one is thinking of buying a vehicle in this category , you really need to drive this one, it is fast, handles like crazy, solidly made and great looking.  A must drive for real enthusiasts.

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2018,steve engles, 06/27/2018,This is THE SUV to drive AND OWN. update 1/8/2020,5,"UPDATE 1/8/20---15230 miles, owned since 4/18.  NO problems (small one with computer saying gas tank was not full---quickly fixed by dealer).  For a new version of a car, this one has had none of the ""first version quirks"" that my other new models have had-----I'm amazed!
Still don't like the layout of the center console---the cup holders are up against the firewall and the buttons, while the knobs for drive-select and computer options are next to driver and get accidentally hit, meaning you have to readjust the read out on the computer screen.  Small annoyance for a GREAT CAR! 

After doing a ton of research from car sites, car magazines, owner reviews, I took a test drive and was hooked.  The Stelvio turns heads---as you pass other cars on the freeway--or in parking lots.  If you use the Dynamic mode, you will witness ""Star Trek"" in this SUV......it moves!   But, if you use Eco Mode, OK, a little slower but saves on gas (premium only).  DON'T buy a base model--there are cool extras (safety, rims, trim, nav, moon roof, etc) that cost a little more but WORTH every penny on the Ti and Sport models.  I have 2500 miles after only 60 days of driving and can honestly say "" this is one of the best cars I've EVER owned ""  and will trade this 2018 in on the next Stelvio version.  Only drawback--you may have to really look for your desired Stelvio with the equipt you want-----they are not plentiful , especially in the western US.  I now have 6700 miles on this vehicle with NO problems (2 mfg recalls on emissions systems due to CA  regs--#$%@$##!) 9 months of driving, freeways, city streets, 2 lane winding-back country roads,etc and STILL think think the same of this performance!

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2018,Domenico, 02/28/2018,"Love the Car, but there something you must know",4,"I bought this car to replace a Maserati Quattroporte, my back was asking me to do it. I fell in love with the reviews, the design and the fact that I was moving to another Italian car, although an SUV, believe me it drives like a sport car. However, I do a lot of business in the car and must say that the failure to have been informed that Stelvios built before December 2017 come with Apple Car Play was very disappointing. The dealer in Van Buys CA never said a word about this, and the owner’s  manual in the car is not much help either. They do have the instructions about Apple Car Play but they are basically useless, make believe, as the feature in not available, unless you purchase a Stelvio built from December 18 and on. Worst yet, when you call Alfa Romeo (forget the dealer as they got your money) they tell you that there’s nothing they can do about it, even though the instructions are in the owner’s manual. And to add insult to injury, they even tell you that there’s no plan for an update to your system either, so you have what you got and that’s it. I love the car, so I will cope and figure it out, but I feel other buyers who have a need for Siri in the car to work and assist while driving, need to know that he/she will not be there, if you are purchasing a vehicle before December 2017. - Ok, 3,000 miles plus later, still love the car. It drives fantastic and you will love it too. No mechanical problems at all, mileage has improved to 22 mixed. I still wish Alfa Romeo had a fixed for the entertainment system. Missing the ability to command your phone through Siri is very annoying.

I'm up to 10,000 miles now and over a 18 months into it and love the car even more. Absolutely no mechanical issues apart from recalls, mileage is better yet at 22.5. It is a pleasure to drive it in any conditions.

This is where i leave you. My son took the car away from me (literally, he loved it so much). I pass it on to him at 12,500 miles and i can only add a couple of things: mileage improved some more and i will miss this car. i have moved on to a Maserati Levante S. i can tell you that there things i miss about the Stelvio, even though the Levante is a much more expensive car. Once my lease is up on the Levante, i am sure i will go back to Stelvio.

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2018,John Doe, 06/28/2019,It's got some things to work out.,2,"My wife and I got this car just over a year ago now, and we are looking to get out of it as soon as possible. With anything, there are pros and cons. In our case, the cons have outweighed the pros.

Cons: 1. In the year that we've owned the vehicle, we have received three recall notices. 2. The dashboard check engine light comes on frequently with warning signs that scroll through practically every electrical feature of the car (collision warning, blinkers, brake lights, and everything else) and say there not working. 3. The dash display frequently glitches out. 4. The car can be very jumpy and randomly, suddenly propel you forward from a stop (like a sudden unintended explosion of acceleration). And 5. The biggest concern I have had with this car has happened twice now. While getting on the highway, where I live we have the traffic lights entering the highway to slow traffic coming in. The auto start/stop feature turns the car's engine off at the traffic, and twice it hasn't come back on immediately. I put my foot on the gas and the car simply started rolling backwards nearly hitting the car behind me (after stopping again and trying again it usually works).

Pros: 1. Insanely good precision steering - point the car where you want it to go and it reacts better than anything I've experienced. 2. Great performance. 3. Really smooth transmission. 4. Styling is quite nice, especially with the bigger wheels. 5. Cool points at parties. 

I think that Alfa has potential for a really great product, but has some kinks to work out. As of now, I have no faith in the longevity of the vehicle. Other reviews don't indicate such an experience, so maybe we just got one of the few bad ones. As stated above though, we are now looking to get out of this car as soon as possible. I look forward to seeing the quality of Alfa improve as it gains experience in the commercial automotive market.

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2018,Ann Ky, 06/25/2018,Best Engine and Handling SUV,5,"NY DailyNews 06/22/2018 article  : "" The 2018 Alfa Romeo Stelvio will impress you with these 8 desirable traits… but it also comes with a weakness. "" http://www.nydailynews.com/autos/street-smarts/8-great-traits-2018-alfa-romeo-stelvio-list-article-1.4040796 They only can point out "" one weakness"" : that is the ""smaller""  cargo hold, ! Actually it's not bad at all. Similar to Audi Q5, bigger than Mercedes GLC, Land rover Discovery Sports.  The bigger SUVs with more cargo space are Mercedes GLE , BMW X5, Land Rover Velar. Those are much bigger SUVs with much worse Gas mileages, and also will cost you much more ! Plus, they do not have the Stelvio's ENGINE , Handling, and the "" Look "" !! Not even need to mention Acura RDX or Lexus RX 350 .  Buying Tips : Buy Ti then adding Sport Package or other , not to buy '' A regular Stelvio with adding other extra "" , the price will be similar. The salesman got confused sometimes. Ti got spacial wood trims. One thing I like to point out : there is no place for the front license place. The NJ / NY law requires two plates, one for the front, another one for the back. My sales lady said that all buyers so far are taking their chances. ( by leaving one plate inside.)

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2018,Al, 09/06/2018,Air Conditioning and Acceleration Delay,4,"Almost a perfect crossover. The only two things I see needing improvement is the slight hesitation from a stopped position, and the air conditioning system. With a performance car, you can't have hesitation, yet at times there seems to be half to full second before the engine reacts to gas pedal. That is most important. Not so important, but of note, is the air conditioning system is not very good. The car never really gets so cold you turn the temperature gauge down, it's always fighting to stay or try to keep you cool. Not sure if it is the system or the fans don't blow enough air, but the interior of the car isn't that big that this should be an issue. First version of the suv, so i am sure these are easily rectified in 2019.

As an update to my review, about 4 months into owning the car, the front parking sensor began malfunctioning....it essentially is aways going off. The shut off switch is left side dashboard below the air vent....i have to turn it off every time I start the car or the alert noise will go off. Car has been in for service twice; both times temporarily relieved the issue, but continues to come back. Have the sensor entirely replaced if this happens. The stereo system occasionally reboots itself, no one knows why.

Still thrilled with the SUV.

***Update to Review***

I have since swapped my 2018 for 2020 and have found that both issues still exist with the build of the car. The air conditioning is directly related to the car being black on black and with the very large glass sunroof, it is nearly impossible to keep the heat out. 

The acceleration issue and shifting pause is still there. The dealer told me the AI of the car is still learning, but that doesn’t sound likely. The car has a slight hesitation from the starting line. The car also, if you slow to a near stop (thru a stop sign as an example or a red light that changes to green as you approach), does not immediately “find a gear” when you push the gas pedal. The car appears to do nothing for a few seconds before engaging. Needs to be addressed at the Alfa service shop. Not sure why they don’t test for this prior to releasing the car. 

Still all in all, I love my car. But these shouldn’t happen on a car of this level.

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2018,Lars Anderson, 05/31/2018,Italalian Uniqueness,5,"I have 10k miles and no problems except recall notice on some molding and an oil change light that only the dealer can turn off. Annoyances are attenuated by all the important positives. Negatives are parking sensors and no Apple CarPlay on my version. Positives well balanced tracking and traction, steering feel, comfortable seats, adequate sound system, good mileage (26 mix and 30 hwy), adequate visibility for styling, very quick, dynamic mode, styling, light projection and unique. Very easy to drive and park minimizing fatigue during hour long commute."
alfa-romeo,stelvio,2018,Joejoe16, 11/15/2018,Fantastic Driving Car Not So Much for Tech,4,"So I purchased my Stelvio Ti about a month ago, red with the chocolate interior. I've heard some say they didn't think the interior materials were very good but I guess being a previous Ford owner, I think it's certainly up to par with a ford Titanium package. The car does turn heads, it's beautiful. I must admit I'm a tech package kind of person so in regards to the navigation, Sirius radio, and touch screen, Android Auto etc. Alfa is about a half decade behind the curve. I knew this going into it and most of these things are software issues  Alfa didn't spend much time developing before releasing the car. As of now American owners can't update their maps while it appears the European models can. Also, mine didn't have Android Auto but if you get a later built 2018 model, you can get a leather wrapped dash and Apple Car Play/ Android Auto as options. There are models with spare tires but they seem few and far between and it's an optional item I wish I had. We're all still waiting for the software update to activate the central infotainment knob touch screen feature. With all those issues aside, you have to consider the good parts as well, the car is fantastic to drive! The aluminum body panels, patent aluminum suspension, drive by wire brakes, carbon fiber drive shaft, Ferrari inspired direct injection engine, 50/50 weight distribution and high performance German transmission make this more of a sports car than utility SUV. Alfa Romeo clearly spent their time getting driving dynamics right before spending time on things like radios and phone app connectivity. For safety it appears to have a Euro 5 star rating with impressive features like knee bags and a slew of optional safety like front collision braking, and lane departure etc. I was fortunate to get one with the front collision braking but not the lane departure or adaptive cruse control. With the discounts Alfa and dealers are giving now on the 2018 models you can't beat the price in this class range but just understand some of items I mentioned above. While I hope Alfa continues to improve their infotainment system with updates, it would appear their communication is not very good for US customers. I hope this changes because this could be a perfect SUV if they want it to be. In ending I would encourage those interested to give it a try, it's a great driving car  that will put a smile on your face and provide all the luxury most car buyers will be happy with, just know that some quirks exist and they are an Italian company breaking back into the American market. Expect there to be hiccups along the way.

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2018,robert segraves, 12/04/2018,Fantastic car at good price,5,"Some reviewers have suggested that the Alfa Romeo has quality control issues. I purchased my Stelvio MONTHS ago and everything works perfectly . Cold weather package ( heated steering wheel, seats) and safety packages ( lane control, forward collision control, rear traffic monitoring etc) all work perfectly, Interior materials are high quality and this SUV handles like a sports car. I would have to has spent about $20,000 more to have a comparable German SUV and the German car would not have been a joy to drive. This car is fun and geared toward the driver in terms of responsiveness and road feel.

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2018,RR, 03/23/2018,Stelvio Bellisimo...,5,"After what seemed an exhaustive search for a sporty SUV to replace our aging, parts consuming 06' Cayenne, we drove a Stelvio. In a word, Awesome! Despite the subtle marketing, lackluster dealership attention and our own time crunch, the car sold itself. It is a quantum leap in ""bang for buck"" (and I mean bang!) value above the BMW, Volvo, GMC, Audi and even the new Cayenne. After 3 months of driving in town and freeway we get 24mpg in the ""A"" mode and less in ""D"", but that's the sport in this sport SUV. It's a well rounded, family utility, yet fun sports car all in one. Don't believe me? Drive one! Highly recommended! 
Addendum: 12K mileage update, Stelvio continues to impress, overall Excellent! Dealer support however, is less than stellar. AR needs to have stand alone dealerships rather than Dodge add-ons IMHO. All that aside, this is one of the best overall ""utility"" vehicles we have owned. Bellisimo...RR
"
alfa-romeo,stelvio,2018,k2002, 03/30/2018,You should indulge in Alfa,5,"If you need an SUV for you to indulge and drive hard then do yourself a favor and get the Stelvio. The front two seats on the sport trim with bolsters are the best. I tested out a GLC AMG43 and a X3 M40i, they are great cars and maybe a step above the base Stelvio but also cost a lot more...for the money and with current offers Stelvio is a steal. Love the precise steering, acceleration, and braking (will take time getting used to as its electronic). The red interior stands out compared to the other options. This is a better driving and handling suv than the regular X3, GLC, and Macan.  If you get the sport, the ride could be a little stiff and passengers in the back seat could complain that its bumpy if the roads are less than perfect. Get it for the sport more than the utility and luxury. I am finding more excuses to drive and its been a while since driving was this fun.

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2018,Yohjo, 04/25/2019,Fun to drive but nothing but problems,1,"2018 Stelvio. First problem was with Seal around third rear brake light peeling out.  Next were four recalls.  Now the start/stop does not work. The passenger seat motor does not work. Stuck in position. Now sunroof does not work. Fortunately stuck in the closed position. Only 18 months old.
UPDATE: A year and a half later and another recall.  Dealers are just as unreliable as the vehicle.  In June of 2019 I had recalls taken care of by Niello in Sacramento.  In September I could not register my vehicle because Niello did not submit the clearance to DMV.  Called and found the dealership had shut down.  Nearest dealership 80 miles away in Livermore.  I raised hell with Alfa, I was running out of time to register.  Alfa agreed to pick up the vehicle and transport it to the dealer and return it the next day.  But the dealership did not send the recall clearance form to me with the vehicle.  Overnight fedex left me one day to spare.  JUNK

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2018,Rick F, 10/02/2018,Great looking car with a myriad of problems,2,"This is a great looking suv but don't believe the hype. Alfa Romeo customer service is terrible and our Ti Sport has had over a dozen mechanical and electrical problems in the first 5,000 miles. After the delling dealership promised to pick up and deliver our car for service, Alfa Romeo stopped the program. We had our car towed 60 miles to the closest dealer who had it for 3 weeks. The following problems occurred in addition to the 3 or 4 safety recalls: transmission slipping, rack and pinion steering complete failure (towing necessary), engine losing power causing us to go home in limp mode, nav system crash, outside temp probe failure, gas door outer skin fell off, headlight washer failure, and more. After calling daily, we managed to get our car back 3 weeks after it was towed to the dealer. When we got it back, the replacement steering rack is binding when turning the wheel in both directions. We want out of this quality nightmare but this junk loses $14,000 in resale value after 9 months and only 6,000 miles. Get anything else.

Considering the professional  reviews, I think the interior is better than was reviewed.  The front seats have a sports car fit and the leather seems very good.  The electric brakes take a little getting used to as does the adaptive cruise control.  I keep getting stopped to complement me on the car, so that's nice.

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2018,Murtaza Hussaini , 05/16/2018,New Alfa owner.,5,By far the best looking suv in the market.  I got the tropheo white with red interiors. It truly is a delight to your eyes. Not a big fan of their infotainment/ navigation system. It seems a bit dated for the car. Handling is decent. I wish if the had a six cylinder with output in the 300s. The sport seats really have you tucked in. The rear view would take time to get used to.

Stelvio beats all of them in styling something new it’s fresh u prolly never seen something like this on the road. Wherever u go people stare at the car. It’s fun to drive. If u really want luxury feeling get the red interior it’s makes lot of different. Can’t say much about reliability yet since I have the car for only 2 weeks. I would say one thing if u really looking for luxury compact SUV give this one a try and I bet u will take Stelvio home with u.

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2018,Alexis, 06/26/2018,Amazing bang for the buck!,5,"This is a luxury SUV that drives an handles like a sports car!  It is one of the sharpest looking SUVs on the market.  The exterior and interior design are top notch.  I have the beautiful metallic green exterior with tan leather interior with the sport seats.  They are supportive and very comfortable. The interior is well insulated with minimal road noise.  This SUV takes off like a rocket so merging onto the Interstate where everybody is doing 75-80 mph is not a problem. I enjoy driving this vehicle even more than the 370Z Nismo I used to own and that is quite a complement. The only thing I can even think of to improve upon the Stelvio is that I wish I have a few more presets under the favorites section of the radio but it is so easy to browse and select other stations that is a very minor thing.  The visibility is excellent and since the Stelvio is so responsive I feel very safe while driving it. I made an excellent decision when I decided to lease this car.  I will probably buy it at the end of the lease unless I decide to get the new Guillia coupe coming out in late 2019.  I love Alfa Romeo and it sister company Fiat.

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2018,Dave, 03/05/2018,Performance minded,5,"Bought a fully loaded Stelvio sport 280hp for my wife and helped parents buy an F-Pace 25t fully loaded. For slightly different reasons each vehicle is the right choice. While excellent discounts are available for the Alfa Stelvio, they are not for the Jag F-Pace. If sport driving experience is your #1 purchase reason, buy the Stelvio. It has an amazing lightweight, nimble handling, power and road feel you may not find on another vehicle. The F-pace is also sporty and fun to race even with the base engine but is a more luxury sport (Jag) feel. It is beautiful from every angles and has better infotainment and Nav. The Stelvio's layout  of interior and infotainment matches its sport character. Both vehicles are too new to rate reliability but only the Jag had an initial plastic part needing refit so far. Quality on both look good. Had 3 weeks of hard rain, and I could not wait to get the Stelvio back on wet roads. I can't believe the traction, and the feeling of confidence I had in that terrible weather. So far I've put 2/3rds of the miles on her car, and she is starting to complain.  Getting good MPG for a lead foot.
Update: at 3yr @19000 mi.
Wife never kept a vehicle past 3 yrs. She has decided to keep this one for 3 more. Besides Alfa updates we have had no problems with this car. Still feel it was a good choice for us. Gas mileage vs performance is amazing.

It was so good I never made it to to the other dealer. I leased one on the spot. I love the design, craftsmanship and interior design. The smell of Italian leather welcomes me every time I open the door. Infotainment system is one of the best I have had so far. Engine is the standard 2 lit I-line turbo with 280 hp rating as many other crossovers out there but the unbelievably well tuned 8 speed transmission makes a huge difference in allowing you to enjoy every downshift and acceleration. Reliability is of course always an issue with Italian cars. Price of driving something different has never been so affordable.This is a great fun car for everyday commute. My other cars: 1-Maserati Levante 2017 (wife never lets me get my hands on it). 2- Chevy Corvette Grand Sport (2017) I love it dearly but I live in Michigan so it is in the garage half of the year. 3- Jeep Grand Cherokee 2017 (nice drive, mpg).

Simple logical controls. Love the interior aesthetics. Was concerned about the perceived reliability and quality. So far no issues at all. Only complaint is that the voice commands don’t work as well- perhaps I need to learn Italian. The infotainment system is also slower to respond than the BMW. It is so much more entertaining to drive that I don’t mind a bit. It’s also nice that it is unique as opposed to the sea of German and Japanese models out there. Exclusivity was not a factor in the purchase decision, but it is nice not to have the 8th Q5 in the parking lot.

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2018,Rickamd, 07/12/2019,"If you must DRIVE an SUV, this is the one",4,"Top of the line TI Lusso with the crema interior.  

.We drive to Vermont from Cape Cod and I now enjoy the drive.

This is the best handling SUV in its class.  The selector allows me to leave it in dynamic mode, where it stays.  Body roll is minimal, and it is sticky.  The big Brembos are smooth and predictable.  When cold the 4 cylinder does have some turbo lag, but then the throttle is responsive and cat quick.  Out performs the Macan.

I didn't want the paddle shifters since I use them rarely.  Great theory, poor execution and use for me.  The engine noise is piped in, but forgive me for that little enjoyment.  I like the crema interior which is limited to the Lusso  (luxury in Italian).

The infotainment system is arduous and clunky, and the graphics for the Nav are 10 years out of date, but I bought it to DRIVE.  Plus, there are millions of Mercedes, Beemers and Audis, but this is a rarely seen car.  I probably won't keep it past the warranty, since it is an Alfa, but so far, this car makes me smile when I drive.

I've had so many over the years, and have really enjoyed some of them, but never found any particularly inspiring.  With the Stevlio I find that I'm looking for reasons to go drive somewhere.

It's effortlessly and definitively sporty, quick to accelerate off the line and passing, but still smooth, quiet and comfortable. I realize some luxury cars have more features, but for me the feature set in the Stelvio is a-ok.  I had no idea there was such a thing as automatic wipers for instance, and 3 memory slots for driver seat seems more than enough. Far more bells and whistles - but more important, the ones that seem to make the most sense - than my '15 Wrangler Sahara.

What a joy to sit in this thing, and more of a joy to drive it. Don't even get me started on how in love with it's looks I am.  It's a head turner.

I’m now at about 7500 miles and, overall, I LOVE this car. First, the obvious, it’s beautiful! Everyone tells me this and I get plenty of stares. But, there’s more than meets the eye. The performance from the car is above all others I test drove. I’d even go as far as to say that it handles better than every single competitor, including the Macan (not that it is better overall). There’s a touch of turbo lag, less in dynamic, but once it responds, it responds with authority. It wants you to drive it hard. There have been a few recalls and a few quirks, but it has not deterred me one bit from loving it. Also, the dealerships have been great so far. I’ve owned several cars in the past, including the Audi Allroad, and this is better and cheaper. It’s definitely the best sporty utility for the money. Highly recommend!"

Turns out it is a great car!  It looks amazing inside and out and has nice quality materials inside.  I have the base model and it drives great, very quick acceleration and great handling!  The engine sound in dynamic driving mode is incredible.  This car makes you feel like you are driving an $80-90k Italian semi-exotic car for about half the cost!  If you drive gently you can get better gas mileage but its so fun to drive that I average 20-21 mpg in mixed driving in dynamic mode.  I initially questioned the reliability but on a lease while under warranty the entire time that didn't stop me and so far it has been very reliable.  It just turned 10k miles and I have not had a single problem with it.  The dealer experience was very good as well (both sales and service).  Overall this car is actually a practical daily driver that is incredibly fun to drive and can make you think your driving a rare Italian exotic!

Called Alfa Care and told they would look into it.  Never called back. Shop told me they can't get the part. My wife's Guilia is still in the shop, 6 weeks!!! Unable to get parts. A car company that can't get  parts for cars it manufactures. No help from Alfa Care. I can't see Alfa staying in North America,  same issues that it had in the 80's. Poor reliability and poor customer service. Will stay with Mercedes and Porsche.

WOW. I told my wife that it's an SUV but I am the driver.  If you love to drive and you want a good looking super fast great handling SUV then this is the one for you.  I tried 4 different models from Mercedes to BMW Audi and Porsche and this is no 1 with a bullet.  The steering is excellent responsive to the touch and in race mode well it's adios muchacho. It looks beautiful. Better than the rest of the pack. It stands alone.

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2018,Nick S, 11/26/2018,Great car; reliability concerns,4,"I was soooo tempted to get this car.  Never got as far as haggling over a lease, but had one not bad offer on a two year.  The car as i write is heavily discounted.  I could have gotten a base AWD for $33k and a Ti for under $40k.  Easily the most fun to drive of all I tested (I drove the Stelvio 3 times).  There are two issues for me:  Interior was meh, the infotainment screen was from the last century AND, I am really concerned about reliability.  This is my everyday car and I need to be able to count on the car.  It came down to the Stelvio, Q5 and the new RDX.  I got the RDX.  Too much good stuff on the Acura to pass up.  Part of wishes I had flipped a coin, but rationality got the better of me.

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2018,Gerald, 12/24/2020,"Expected style and fun, unexpected reliability",5,"This compact SUV looks like no other coming or going, and even the standard version handles like it's on rails.  The 4-cylinder engine, while somewhat peaky, is simultaneously powerful and efficient consistently delivering over 20 MPG in city driving. In almost two years of driving, we have had zero (!) problems, and only one recall.  Weak points?  The infotainment system is far from state-of-the-art (corrected with the 2020 models) and a smallish luggage capacity.  Overall it has been a great purchase and a great value relative to what we actually paid for it, as there are lots of deals to be had.  Highly recommended.

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2019,Replay8885, 02/05/2019,Performance and style over storage . . .,5,"I wanted to transition from a turbo sedan to an SUV for the additional height but did not want the sluggish performance or soccer mom feel of a typical bulky SUV ---- and the Stelvio fits the bill for me.  It's a beautiful SUV (Italian styling) that prioritizes handling and power over storage space and gadgets.  There is a learning curve --- the brakes did feel grabby to me at the start but after a month, I have adjusted and no longer find that to be an issue.  Ditto with the infotainment controls --- I was used to a touch screen and the Stelvio uses a knob and buttons in the center console, but after some time, I find I actually prefer the Stelvio's controls since they are easier to reach and the screen isn't covered with fingerprints.  Start button, shifter, and turn signals are also different than the typical SUV but again, I learned how to use them.  Android Auto works smoothly and I use Waze for nav. The back up screen is my only real complaint --- it's small and has poor picture quality --- but I don't spend that much time backing up and with so many things to love about the Stelvio, it's a minor issue.    To date, no quality issues at all but I've only had my Stelvio for a month.  It's a kick to drive especially when you can get out on the open road and really let the Stelvio run wild.   Corners better than almost any vehicle I've ever owned. Right now, the Stelvio is a great value since it's often overlooked in the very crowded luxury small SUV segment but as it becomes more popular, I would expect dealers to offer less of a discount off the MSRP.   The Stelvio is an unusual SUV so you don't see your car everywhere --- though you do catch curious and admiring looks trying to figure out what make it is.  It's not for everyone but that's the point --- if you listen to the beat of your own drum and want performance and style, the Stelvio is definitely worth consideration.

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2019,Badger, 06/06/2019,Quadrifoglio - Unique SUV,5,"This is a different kind of SUV... 
Behind the wheel, you feel like you're driving a sports car.  Bucket seats, precision handling, firm suspension, great road feel, sharp brakes, and that engine/exhaust noise...Oh yes.. Classic sports car... Then you look around ... And behold... A back seat and decent cargo space!  
Is it as refined as a Mercedes-AMG GLC 63S ?... No.
Is it as sophisticated as a Porsche Macan Turbo?... No
Does it have the monster engine of a Jaguar F-Pace SVR?... No.

Not for everyone... But if you wanted to drive a sports car that made your pulse race and put a smile on your face, however necessity insists on something a little more practical, this is it.

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2019,W in Colorado, 10/03/2019,Italian beauty,5,"I bought a 2019 Stelvio Ti Lusso and I love it.  The Stelvio is probably not for everybody, but if you prioritize handling and performance in a beautiful package, the Stelvio could be for you.  In a world where most small SUVs are built as appliances to provide practicality, utility and comfort for running errands and commuting, the Stelvio differentiates itself from the pack with stellar performance and driving fun.  It will put a smile on your face every time that you drive it.  The Stelvio is actually a great value too – as the base engine provides the performance that can only be found in some of the upgraded engine packages of the competition at much higher prices.  The only base engine that comes close is in the Audi Q5 – and we own one of those too.  If I hadn’t bought the Stelvio, I probably would have bought another Q5.  The Q5 is quieter, has more trunk space and better technology.  The Q5 is also nearly as fast, handles well and is a snowmobile in the winter (we ski in the Colorado mountains almost every week).  Although the Q5 is a great vehicle, it has some annoying quirks and I find the seats to be uncomfortable on long drives.  It also just lacks the pure driving pleasure of the Stelvio.  The other thing that I appreciate about the Stelvio is that not everybody has one.  In our neighborhood, we have multiple X3’s, X5’s, RX’s and other luxury SUV’s but nobody else has an Alfa.  When you drive the Stelvio in public, people notice it and ask about it.  With the metallic black paint, yellow brake calipers and 20” five hole wheels, it looks exotic and stands out from the more sedate competition.  If you want a sports car with AWD and the practicality of an SUV, check out the Stelvio.

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2019,AlfaDrvr, 07/02/2019,A fun to drive crossover,5,"I needed a 4WD vehicle that could fit the family.  I replaced a BMW328i with my Stelvio after driving 12 different cars and SUVs (Audi, BMW, Honda, Ford, Acura, Subaru etc.).  I'm extremely happy with my choice. The combination of handling, power, smoothness, and simply being fun to drive are something I couldn't find in anything else that would fit two adults in the rear seat comfortably and carry a reasonable amount of stuff.

The value is excellent.  A comparably equiped BMW X3 would have been a solid $12K more with real leather and you can't get Android auto.

Alfa Romeo seems to be aiming squarely at the part of the BMW and Audi market who like to drive. I think they hit the mark and they got my business.

Update after 9 months and 8000 miles.  The Stelvio drives great in the snow, hauls stuff with the back seats down, had plenty of room for people, and had been a great car so far.
"
alfa-romeo,stelvio,2019,Bucky, 09/14/2019,Perfect For Me,5,"12,145 miles and the Stelvio is running fine. I haven't had any major issues. Two minor issues since new; one the battery was junk and the other one that seems to be common is the Radar lens on the right lower front fell off. Both replaced under warranty. The only items that seem glitchy are Apple car Play which doesn't always launch (could be me?) and the automatic High Beam which works but not as I'd expect. It many times won't click to high even when it's really dark? I have to get this looked at. The dealer Valenti Alfa Romeo has been great and between them and Alfa I feel like they are trying to keep me happy. I'd buy the Stelvio again.

I stand by my original comments and have read that some of the minor stated issues were taken care of on the 2020 model. It remains a solid and fun car to drive.

Small to mid-size SUV's all look the same but I needed one so I reluctantly searched and thankfully found the Stelvio. My must haves are a unique stylish look and excellent handling & performance. I spent a month reading the reviews of the BMW, Audi, Porsche, Jag and Volvo which were good but regarding their looks and especially the driving experience they all fell in behind the Stelvio. Their cost was also an issue. The Stelvio style lines are excellent making it stand-out as very different and the complaints regarding lack of luxury and quirky controls were overstated. I test drove the 2019’s and settled on the Ti Sport with almost all the options including the hitch and full spare. ($58.5k MSRP) A definite must is the Ti Sport performance package which includes the active suspension and limited slip rear differential.  The Ti Sport beats the competition in the N mode but switching to the D mode of driving puts the Performance Package in play and it’s an impressive change. It’s a hot rod race car! If you drive one with this option you'll have to have it! I have no complaints regarding performance of the engine, transmission, handling or brakes, they all respond to make the drive thrilling. You’ll want to drive this car hard so have to be careful to avoid tickets! I love the seats because they support and force a proper driving position. Paddle shifters are perfect. Active Cruise, lane change, side & front warnings and cross traffic all work fine. I found nothing wrong with the climate control and the sound system is fine. Automatic high beam feature seems a little quirky and the Navigation is plain but has enough features and does what it’s intended to do. I don’t care about its graphics. Back up camera window is small but fine. CarPlay and Bluetooth can sometimes be quirky but I usually stay in CarPlay mode which works well. Sure it’s not touch screen but it doesn’t take long to master the knob style device; besides once you establish your settings they’ll rarely change. Voice commands need a little time to sync to your voice so in the beginning a little annoying but is fine now. In general it’s a 4 star regarding technology compared the others I mentioned but a 5 star on performance/handling. I love driving it and get many compliments on the looks.

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2019,Chris Johnson, 01/25/2020,A slightly different take-what to expect,5,"Bought a white one, 21 inch wheels, Nero package, red calipers.  It's chocolate for one's eyes.   It's fully loaded as far as Alfa makes them, and it's just a deal at $48k.   Nope, not the most luxurious.  Nope, not the most safety-nanny features.   But this vehicle drives like nothing else, there is so much tactile feedback in a subtle way, it's just a ton of fun to drive.  Steering is incredible, and it has a voracious grip on the road.   The brakes grab like a beast too, not sure why so many ""experts"" find a fault in that!?  And it's just sneaky fast too, once you learn the rev ranges at various speeds, you can play with traffic all day long.   

But I'm going to talk about the quirks too.   It's what I love about the vehicle, and besides, what vehicle doesn't have a few quirks?   

A pillar and side view mirror, are a bit thick.  The price for the elegant style of this is a bit of a ""blind"" spot looking forwards and to the side.  Be careful, pedestrians will appreciate that for sure on your right hand turns.  

Fold down rear seats, you have to make sure the front seats are forward a bit, otherwise the head rest hits the seat backs.   Thank goodness I'm short so I don't have to do much fiddling with the front seats to get the rear backs totally flat.  

Some of the buttons in the car, when lit, system is off.  Also, when lit, system is on.  Drove me nuts at first, but left of the steering wheel, light on, system off.  Center of the car, light on, system on.  See, it's simple :).

Paddle shifters, some reviews complain they are in the way.  I don't agree, I love em and you learn to pop them for quick gear shifts so you can get the most of the car without having to necessarily mash the gas pedal.   And the steering wheel itself, visual candy yet so on point for drivers too.  

Quality of the center screen isn't great and it has no touch.  However, using the various dials and buttons in the center console area, I can actually navigate way faster without taking myself out of a good driving position, so on a spirited romp, touching the screen is truly a negative......but I have to concede the back camera is terrible, at night in reverse or heavy rain, it's basically worthless.  The light above it glares too much onto it, and then when it's wet and/or dirty, the screen is a total blur.  Daytime though, dry conditions, it's fine.   And make sure you have a few soft clothes to clean the lens from time to time, it tends to collect dirt more than you would hope for, 

Climate control, fought this for a bit, but the best way is to just leave it in full auto mode, with the A/C button lit (so it's on).  Then go to whatever heat or cooling temp you want, the car figures it out and does a great job of conditioning the cabin.   However, if you start doing manual inputs, taking the A/C off, auto off, it just gets confused and will be in a weird mode of blowing cold air when you want heat and vice-versa if you are in the ""normal"" temp modes most would find comfort in.  

Now for some of things most wouldn't think of till you've owned one of these for almost year as I have.  The wind shield and sunroof do an amazingly good job of repelling heat.   The vehicle just doesn't get hot inside like other panoramic roof top vehicles I have had.  Kudos to Alfa on this for sure.  Also, the sunroof is nice and simple, while it's a little on the noisy side when open at highway speed, around ton, it's perfect.   

Last note, if you want to get stopped in a parking lot a half dozen times a week by people asking questions, buy a Stelvio with some nice rims.  The vehicle just speaks to them.   And if you really want a show stopper, get the red interior, it's totally Italian and just invigorating to sit in it day after day for sure.

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2019,Matt Barry, 07/17/2019,After a Year... After 2 Years,3,"I've owned a Porsche, a Benz, a G35 but with a family, opted to try the Alfa. The handling is amazing and the design is gorgeous. Spacious enough for me and the kids and the gas mileage is decent. But... here are the problems. 1) It dings and rings every single time you even get CLOSE to another car or curb. The front, when it bottoms, yells at you! There's no touch screen! ARE YOU KIDDING? It's 2019! There's no SPARE? ARE YOU KIDDING? And you CANNOT find the replacement tire ANYWHERE. Yup, had a screw in the tire. 309 bucks later. LAME storage space for change, keys, etc. Oh, and THE most annoying thing... if you're on your hands free, and you go into your house, it KEEPS SWITCHING BACK TO INSIDE THE CAR, even though you haven't been in your car for 10 minutes (I finally figured out how to fix it, thanks to YouTube. The dealer didn't even know how!) Forget trying to answer your phone while backing up. It's a sexy car, but I've had sexy girlfriends, too and in the end, both weren't worth the extra effort. 

UPDATE: Right before its 2nd year and subsequent turn it, it fell apart - dead battery, water leaked into the passenger door frying the electrical system and destroying the speaker - after 2 weeks in the shop... it died again... same problem... 2 more weeks in the shop... I just told them to keep it and good riddance!!!

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2019,Mfffffffffffff, 09/16/2019,"Great Ride, Questionable Tech",4,"I've had the car about 2 weeks.  The acceleration is surprisingly good for a 4cyl. engine and as some reviews have said the brake feel is a bit odd - but you get used to it.  On the first acceleration after a cold start the transmission has some trouble figuring out where it should be, but that goes away very quickly.  The car is ""nimble"".  It's not a sports car, but for an SUV, it's amazingly agile.  It's also QUIET inside; well insulated from road noise, pervasive on the worn-thin road surfaces the Seattle area- a real blessing.  As pointed out in some reviews, the pillars are rather thick and block a complete view.  Tear window, due to it's angle, provides a truncated vertical view.  Also, getting in and out (I'm average height) is a careful procedure due to the rake of the A pillar.  Electronics:  The screen is on the small side which isn't really an issue except for the backup camera.  Also when using Waze or Google Maps or any other function with Android Auto, it's hard to do anything else with the infotainment system - not impossible, but difficult at best. (I don't know if it's car's fault or that of Android Auto.)   All in all, I'm very happy with it.

Free service and recall just completed at pleasant dealership. Loaner was my identical car! Downside is the Gera shifter is a little cheap felling and the brakes take a little getting used to but other than that I love it. Buy one. The 2019 is on great deals right now and if you get one with radar cruise control it’s pretty up to date.

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2019,D A, 03/15/2020,STELVIO QUADRIFOGLIO VS URUS,5,"I have owned a Lamborghini Urus and I can tell you first hand that for the price difference of $150K the SQ is as viseral and fun to drive as the Urus and it is lighter, smaller and more nimble. It feels very similar to  a Ferrari F430 when it comes to shifting and handling. The exhaust tone is just as radical as the Urus. It is a driver's car. The interior is absolutely 100% sports car especially the CF that envelopes the cabin. I am 100% satisfied!! Great value for the money!!"
alfa-romeo,stelvio,2019,Fedorath, 06/27/2020,The Unmentioned Model,5,"I have a '19 Stelvio Quadrifolio and it is Breathtaking in is handling, Braking (Unnecessary Carbon Fiber Package and comfort whether it is on mountain back roads or on the highway.

This model is a sleeper unless you know what the four leaf clover badges on the front fenders mean.

It is margianlly faster than the Giuia sedan thanks to its four wheel drive, which never sends more than 50% of its power forward. The engine is designed and built by Ferrari and I am told by the servicing mechanic that everything inside the engine is labeled ""Ferrari"". Imagine: 2.9 Liters producing over 500hp!. The best part is that the car can handle the power and those of us who may be a bit older can get in and out without a problem.

The car is just plain Superb!

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2019,Dan Schaffrin, 07/19/2020,Italian Performer 5 stars,5,"The old story of Alfa's not being reliable is definitely in the past. We've never had any problem whatsoever. Our car is as quick, beautiful, and great comfort as anyone would ever need. We tested a Tesla model S performance vehicle after we had our Stelvio for a year. The Tesla was quicker than our Alfa, and that's all I can say about it. However being a drag racer back in the 70's, I will say that performance would scare the life out of any daily driver. My wife is 5 ft tall, and the seat would not raise high enough for her to test drive it. Very disappointing. It was 91 degrees outside and the a/c never did perform adequately. All we can positively say about the Tesla is it was quiet."
alfa-romeo,stelvio,2019,David, 09/16/2020,Athletic ride and fun car to have,5,"We're moved over to the Alfa after having a few BMW X3's, the last of which was had the no longer available straight six.  We like the styling of the Alfa inside and out (still do) and wanted the more muscular engine without going for the fuel drinking M that is now the only way to get a bigger engine in the BMW SUV.  The Alfa provides faster acceleration and better handling in the more base models.  We had some concerns about reliability, but are now well past 20k with our 2019 Alfa and have had no problems.  It's a fun car that gets people's attention and yet still checks the SUV boxes.

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2019,Mark G, 07/26/2020,Like this new experience so far,4,It’s different in its own special way. Worth giving it a try. 
alfa-romeo,stelvio,2019,HappyRC, 08/10/2019,I loved it as a driver but car sick as a passenger,3,"Last weekend, I took a test drive of the 2.0 turbo Stelvio.  
PRO: 
- acceleration
- fast shift transmission
- handling
- Apple Carplay
CON:
- stiff ride, even in the base $46k msrp model with AWD
- as a passenger, my head bobbled like a bobblehead doll and made me car sick
- Tiny 6.5 inch screen, should be at least 7 inches
- rearview mirror had a big black thing behind it so it covered the center of the windshield

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2019,Wendy M, 06/17/2019,Driving a dream for those who dream of driving,2,"I test drove everything-EVERYTHING: Lexus, Lincoln, Cadillac, Mercedes, Audi, BMW, Jaguar, Porsche, Volvo, and more-for three months until I stumbled upon Alfa Romeo/ Maserati next to the Jag dealership I test drove at. I got in, took off and pulled into a nearby parking lot and started going in circles and slamming on brakes and quickly changing directions. During this time, my friend dropped her cell phone on the floorboard and was leaning forward to pick it up and didn't even feel the car going in every direction. She even looked up right as I slammed on the brakes and said, ""wow, it feels like we just ran into a pillow"". I don't know how some feel about the brakes but, you will be hard pressed to get a smoother braking than this-like your're being stopped in a pillow-smooth. The ride-smooth. The look-smooth. You don't need a little itty bitty two seat, no trunk race car to have a race car. You have it all. This is my first luxury car. Before I spent this kind of money I wanted to get the most for it. I test drove everything and left each one thinking- that's all, for that kind of money? I drove this car and I was smiling, laughing, giddy with excitement. It left me wanting more. Be sure to get the forward collision. When in traffic, put the car on cruise control and let it drive itself. If you want the vroom vroom noise don't get this car. It is like a stealth bomber-you can get the car going over 100 mph and your passengers, unless the are looking at the speedometer, won't even realize it until you pass somebody. It is like driving a hot knife through butter. I don't understand the Edmunds' complaint of a hard headrest-it feels like memory foam to me and it the most cushioned head rest I've ever felt-like laying your head on a pillow. You also get a two-for-one here: you won't mind taking the car in for servicing because they give you a Maserati loaner to drive. If you want vroom vroom Maserati is you answer, but the ride is not as smooth. Take this out for a test drive-really DRIVE it and you won't leave without one. What this car lacks in the infotainment center it makes up for in the drive, and isn't that what you really buy a car for? I feel like I'm in a dream every time I drive it.

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2019,Ehaley, 03/12/2020,Best Sport SUV,5,"Coming from a GM vehicle (Tahoe) I wanted to downsize.  There were alot of choices.  Problem is they are almost all the same ( same looks and performance)  found out Alfa Romeo was back in the US.  Absolutely fell in love with the looks. Once I took it for a test drive it was a done deal. Stunning handling,  excellent layed out interior and the performance was amazing.  You will not be disappointed  !!

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2019,Rich E., 05/05/2020,"Finally a fine handling, standout SUV!",5,"The Stelvio is a well balanced (50/50 weight distribution) Vehicle. It's handling in all conditions New England can throw at is extremely competent. The Q4 all wheel system is seamless and compliments this primarily rear wheel drive platform. I am currently averaging 24.5 mpg and have seen 31.5 mpg @ 70-75 mph consistently on the highway. It is a great city vehicle due to the responsive, stable handling, great visibility and a strong powertrain. The 8 speed ZF transmission compliments the 2.0 Liter turbo. It is never left flat-footed in a traffic situation where horsepower and torque is needed.  The HVAC system heats and cools the cabin very well with minimal fan noise. The tremendous, 3 setting, heated seats and steering wheel are welcoming on a 10 degree morning! The body panels are aluminum, bonded to a high strength steel inner structure. No creaks, groans or flex! It has a 5 star Euro NCAP safety rating (built like a vault!) Reliability has been perfect. Zero issues in 6,000 miles of New England winter and spring roads. I drove all of the competitors (BMW, Audi, Acura, Volvo). I saw no reason to buy any one of them. It drives that much better and has a 110 year history of handling superiority and powertrain excellence to support that. What more can I say!

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2020,SKYXX, 02/14/2020,Awesome,5,"2020 Alfa Stelvio is incredibly fun to drive.  Fast and confident in the turns, fuel economy could be better, but the lead foot dosent help.  Traded in a Lexus GX 460 (great car, had it's prupose) would not go back.

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2020,CB, 10/02/2020,A drivers SUV,5,"Just purchased a Stelvio Ti sport after cross shopping Audi Q3 and Q5, Porsche Macan, Volvo XC60, Mercedes GLC, and BMW X3.
The Stelvio and Macan had the best handling characteristics of the group, however, the Stelvio delivered the more engaging driving experience overall.
We also preferred the styling of the Stelvio....ours is Rosso Competizione with the Nero Edizione package....it is absolutely stunning and draws quite a few curious onlookers.  The leather interior option (dash, door panels) is very upscale....the interior controls have a quality feel to them and the new infotainment system is very intuitive and easy to use.
This vehicle puts a smile on your face every time you get behind the wheel....handles like a sports sedan....so much fun to drive....very pleased so far!!!

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2020,Scalewoodman, 12/16/2020,Liked our 2018 So Much We Flipped to a 2020!,5,"A funny thing happened when we took our 2018 Stelvio in for 50K mile service: We came home with a new one! These are truly special cars to drive and own-- the Swiss Army knife (Italian Army?) of vehicles: Space for 5, haul capability (my bike fits in the back) but a great drive train that purrs when it needs to (30 mpg on a trip, no problem) and roars when you want to have some fun carving back roads in 'Dynamic' mode! Thoughtful improvements for 2020 but the truth is this is my favorite all-time vehicle for driving, economy, comfort, and luxury well-equipped right out of the wrapper. Adaptive headlights turn with the vehicle; carbon fiber driveshaft; 8 speed ZF trans; Brembo drive by wire braking with accident avoidance and safety features. Beautiful and great build quality with no issues (other than recalls on the early builds). Highly recommend. Hope to see many more Alfas roaming the streets in the future!

alfa-romeo,stelvio,2020,Drew, 12/08/2020,"Give it a go, you really won't be disappointed",5,"Was a long time VW owner and ended up in Tiguan R Line but it spent most of the 1st year in the shop with so so many quality issues.  Driving experience sucked too and engine gutless.  Gave up on VW and started shopping.....looked at Q5, GLC and X3 but the Stelvio beat them all for looks, fun and power.  So far this is the most reliable vehicle I've owned and that includes Toyota and Mazda.  Seriously impressed, you should give it a chance.

bentley,bentayga,2018,Larry Keller, 08/28/2018,Software problems with new electronics,3,"This is our fourth Bentley that we have owned. We purchased a 2018 Bentagya in November 2018. Currently we have 7200 miles on it and this is what we have encountered.
This generation of Bentley has a new set of electronics compared to the last three we owned. We do not like this new set of electronics, the car is very unpredictable and not user friendly. We do not feel this is a SUV that you can relax and drive. You need to be attentive to certain situations that can occur.
For example every time you turn on the air conditioner and / or heater, you must set your settings each time, (windshield, dash vents, or floor). You need to press more buttons to get the system to work. I have figured out that you need to set up the air system before you start driving due to the time to set up and not looking at the road.
The driver door does not close automatically and will cause the parking brake to come on, whenever you stop. See more in other paragraph.
Bentley has also designed a shut off mode for the motor, that is on unless you turn it off each time you start the car. If you forget to shut off that button or change modes, watch out. You will go to push the gas at a stoplight and nothing will happen, then about the count of 3, BAMMMMM!!! Your car shoots off thru the light. We have almost rear ended several cars because of this. You go to push the gas and nothing happens, you wonder what happened, and then it starts and rockets off. 
The front end collision braking system has activated several times on me, and once on my wife, when there was nothing close to the front of the car. When this occurs it almost throws you thru the windshield and makes you nervous each time you see the red light in the dash light up.
The biggest problem we have had is the driver door will not shut automatically with the motor all the time. Sometimes it shuts and sometimes it does not. If you restart the car, it will work (electronics). We took it to the dealer; they tried to update the system with a software update. It did not work. Our door still does not close and now they want to order the part to fix it. I think it is more of an electrical problem than part, but we will see.
The day before we had the car in for service, I had a low tire light come on, so I asked them to fix it. I was told when I picked up the car that they could not fix the tire because the tread was too low and it was against their policy to fix tires in that tread range. Keep in mind that the car only had 6900 miles on it at that time. So my question is, are the tires on the Bentagya only good for 10,000- 12,000 miles? I guess so. Expect to replace your tires after the first year of driving, due to the cheap tires they are putting on them.
This Bentagya is not the SUV that we were hoping for when we purchased it. With what we have encountered so far, I would suggest a Range Rover and save yourself $130,000.

bentley,bentayga,2018,Gersalv, 08/07/2019,UNSAFE TO DRIVE,1,"I own a 2018 Bentley Bentayga. It is everything they say about handling, car colors, speed, etc. Hoever what is NOT said is the car' s safety. After only 8800 miles, I took my car in for the first service, which I thought would be routine oil change, filter, etc. I was horrified to learn that my brakes were dangerously low! I had to not only replace pads but rotors as well which had already been damaged. The service manager at the dealer told me this is a common problem with this car. I am an elderly woman who drives to Dr's apts, church, shopping, etc. I called Bentley numerous times for an explanation. Customer Service told me the Regional Manager would call. After not less than 5 calls, he has yet to return my call. 
You take your life and the life of your loved ones  in your hands driving this  car.

bentley,bentayga,2018,Bryce, 10/26/2019,Simply amazing,5,"I simply have nothing bad to say about this incredible work of art.  I drive mine fast and hard.  I always turn off the auto engine shutoff on every car I drive.  This is now standard in every high end car.  O -145mph feels the same as 70-150mph.   No jerk, no stall,  you are just instantly gone.  It is like a jet engine with no gforce.   I have recommended one to all my friends.  Super comfy as well

bentley,bentayga,2019,Jon Wilson, 07/22/2019,"Yes, pure amazing",5,"There’s nothing really to say, accept this car is amazing, the one problem though, is the price. But that’s really all there’s to say! So I recommend this car!

bentley,bentayga,2019,John Kidd, 02/11/2020,John Kiidd,5,"VW had a lot to say with the Bentayga, Urus and others within the group. Season, save money on underspend designs. The Bentayga is a stunning Suv. Don't need luxury in the boot, but Bentley do give you some expensive options.The audio is excellent but the MMI could of been upgraded. Install a wide body Mansory kit for about £85000 (Not cheap) but it makes the motor Amazing, try and keep away from keeping the bonnet & radiator couling Carbon look, if painted with the right body colour, it will look Stunning"
bentley,bentayga,2019,GVH, 02/05/2020,German luxo rocket with traditional English issues,4,"Not pretty but imposing. Excellent interior with 1990s infotainment .The W12 engine is a rocket while its trasmission while fast and precise, is too ""reactive"" and switches gears too often at medium speed city traffic Excellent ride and silence, very polished.Does not feel as big as it is behind the wheel. Glitchy warnings scare you with alarming messages such as drive system fault!

2018 Supersports Convertibles  are rare used . Only 150 made it to the US This is your last beautiful ride 
Smooth , incredible power. Beautiful , Quiet ride . With the windscreen , the Top down is beautiful.  Lamborghinis and Ferrari’s are showy

You can actually drive this around town 
Just a true obsession

bentley,flying-spur,2014,Happy Mom, 12/29/2016,A Heavenly Ride!,4,"I have driven many luxury cars, Mercedes, BMW, Maserati, Jaguar, to name a few, but this ride by far, is like no other! On a scale of 1-10 I give it a 12 in comfort and the same for it's impressive look. My only issue is that I'm a tech-lover and it seems to be that even this updated version (I previously owned a 2009) doesn't offer the same technology as, say the Maybach or even a simple Mercedes GL (which I had as a loaner car and appreciated the technology). So I'd say that's the only thing it lacks but otherwise it's one helluva machine!
"
bentley,flying-spur,2014,Suzie Villere, 06/14/2020,Looks and runs like a Bentley!,5,"This is not for the faint of wallet, but is a car you can own for a couple of decades.  Bentley styling is timeless... the 1990s-era Arnage still looks handsome and stylish today.  The materials are the very best, and the fit and finish is unparalelled."
bentley,flying-spur,2015,Abe, 12/13/2015,>2 minutes tin can,4,"The review after 3 years with about 23,000 miles:
I really did not have any problem with anything except with the display unit. It kept freezing and not responding to any touch/button unless the car is turned off and turned on again. They replaced it under warranty but I understand it would have been >$6K items if I had to pay. Other than this there has been no other issue. Car is still very nice to drive and feels as good as new. Of course there has been NO fix the to electronic performance that I mentioned below. It is pity for a car like this to have such terrible electronic performance. Cars with 1/10th the cost has better electronic performance. Apparently this was a known issue even on the previous models. Some body should have been fired over this!
By the way, I have V8  Flying Spur not V12 as the heading says. I could not navigate to change it to V8.

I have 2015 Bentley Flying Spur V8. This is how long it takes for it to load up the phone files and it takes almost 25 seconds for the rear camera to come on in the morning. When you go over the road divider rectangular reflectors it makes noises that makes you think you are driving ""PINTO"" It actually ""accelerates"" when you want to decelerate in cruise control mode before it decelerates. These are some of the features that Bentley calls ""normal"" It took repeated calls and days for the Bentley customer service manager to call me back. Other than some of these problems, it is a beautiful car, fun to drive, quality finishes all thru. Information system is actually pretty functional and intuitive but its performance sucks! It is a big car but it feels sporty and connected to the road. It would have been really a great car if it did not have these problems that Bentley calls normal.  I have about 6K miles on it so far and it had no mechanical problem.
"
bentley,flying-spur,2015,Charles Jones, 07/01/2016,Fantastic!,5,"The 2016 Flying Spur is absolutely perfect.  The interior quality and finish is second to none, as expected.  The thing that surprised me the most is how fun the car is to drive.  You cant hear a thing when driving in the cabin.  The ride is so smooth I didn't even notice I was going 100 mph until I looked down and the beautiful instrument cluster.  Purchasing a radar detector is certainly a good idea. This is a heavy car but it corners and handles like a dream.  Put it in sport mode and you actually have more power then you know what to do with. Took the car over a windy mountain pass and I was simply amazed at how well the car ate up the curves.  Coming from an S550 4matic there is really no comparison between the two.  Totally different driving experience in a good way.  Oh, and its also nice when passengers from other cars are taking pictures of the Flying Spur as you drive by.

bentley,arnage,2001,BentleyBoy, 06/18/2008,Breathtaking!,4,"I quit keeping track in 1989 but, at that point I had owned over 160 cars. Nothing even comes close in quality, curb appeal, performance, unabashed good looks, handling, design, ride quality, even the smell of this car (including Rolls-Royce). Everywhere you go people will compliment and envy you in this automobile. Most can't even tell what it is! I currently own 4 Porsches , Ferrari Maranello, a Vintage XKE and 6 other American muscle cars but can't wait to drive this car at every opportunity. It simply takes your breath away. It's the 2nd one I've purchased. The dealer is 'proud' of his parts and will ding you unmercifully but, it's the price you pay to drive the Best Car On The Planet."

most elegant automobile currently on 
the planet; and it is all hand built 
too.  The ""last"" of the truly handmade, 
one of a kind (each) English motorcars!
Amazing; and all this for the price of 
a small, well located summer home. 
Imagine!"

As soon as you open the doors, yes even on an 18 year old vehicle, the wreak of class overwhelms your senses.  You are first stunned by the elegance while simultaneously intoxicated on the smell of the finest Nappa leather and luxurious fleece carpeting then, while your feeling your image touched by a Madison Avenue PR firm, your ears are treated to a sound room designed for the most enthusiastic audiophile.  If all of the senses overload isn't enough, prepare yourself for jet-like power transcending you like a bullet-train with nary a road sound or rumple to disturb your dream like magic carpet ride.  Aladdin would gladly swap places with the lucky owner of this motor carriage!

Gone are the days when my Arnage would have made me special. I now must see Continental GT's and Flying Spurs daily on the local streets. Now my Arnage just brings me joy because it is such a wonderful automobile. It's quick without being startling. It's refined and stately. In a world where S-Class Mercedes Benzes are as common as Fords, the Arnage insures that I will not only arrive in style but in an automobile that is not as everyday as some lesser automobiles."

Its an amazing car to drive, elegant, imposing, and  extremely fast. The car's long wheel base on the Arnage chassis gives it the proper weight and stature on the road. Its a huge car, but the awesome design keeps the proportions well in check. This is the only modern ""super car"" in my garage (I own 10+ classics) and if maintained and treated properly will surely go up in value given the extremely low production and Bentley brand. Give it another 5 years and it will be a $300k plus car.

bentley,continental-flying-spur,2006,bobbyo, 07/09/2010,Still good,4,"I agree with all the positive comments, which you'll note hint at some flaws in the design and operation of the car but do not in any way detract from the experience of owning one. I didn't see much substance in the negative reviews- was it the same guy writing them all? This car is fantastic, fast comfortable and smooth. Garners a lot (repeat, a lot!) of stares and comments. True luxury that mass-produced BMW's and MB's can't begin to match (Mercedes had to come out with the Maybach line to even try). My biggest complaint is the rear seat area, it squeaks rattles and shakes whenever you hit a bump, due to a suspension that is quite active and ""vocal"" over bumps. Reliability has been great."
bentley,continental-flying-spur,2006,SpineGod, 10/31/2006,Great Car,4,"I've had my Flying Spur since April. It is a great car and it is not ubiquitous like all other luxury sedans on the market today. It is fun to drive, has a huge trunk, and accelerates like a sports car. If it had iPod integration, it would be the greatest car ever. That said, I love these new Bentleys. I can't wait to get my Continental GTC."
bentley,continental-flying-spur,2006,davidhart, 04/23/2011,After 4 yrs I still LOVE to get behind the wheel..,4," In my lifetime I've owned some pretty special cars but my Flying Spur is in a class alone and far above any of the others.
After 4 yrs. I still anticipate with excitement my next drive.
It's a head turner (95 % favorable but a few truly nasty and envious remarks shouted out) and a delight in all ways from remarkable comfort, performance, uncompromising quality of construction and materials, and understated elegance inside and out.
The only comment I can make even slightly negative is that I noticed a improvement in ride, quietness, and handling when I changed from the factory-installed Dunlap tires to Michelin Sport A/S Plus 275/35 ZR20's.
I feel it's not hyperbole to rate it 5 stars."
bentley,continental-flying-spur,2006,Charles, 08/21/2015,Can afford this car 10 years later,5,"This is a very special car, not your daily driver. 10 years later exterior quality still better than most new cars, interior good shape but color of wood/leather show slight age but still impressive since it's all leather and wood. Bought it for fun so use it occasionally, feels pretty good paying just 1/3 of the original price with very low miles. Can buy a new LS460 or this10 year old Bentley for around the same price, I'm very happy with my choice especially I'm just half the age of other Bentley drivers =P

bentley,continental-flying-spur,2006,SAEarly, 09/13/2006,Flying Spur is in a Class by Itself,4,"A super luxury sedan with 4 wheel drive, 0 to 60 acceleration in 4.8 seconds, and a top speed of 195+ mph (magazine reviews) is not available anywhere currently in this price range except from Bentley. Austin Martin is planning something in next 2+ years. The super huge trunk is great for trips but the acceleration at any speed makes it fun to drive even though it weighs about 5,500 pounds. Our Beluga exterior with chrome wheels and Cognac/Beluga interior looks stunning. Other drivers have actually backed from other lanes at red lights to do a double take. While drivers going the other way have stared or even turned around to get a better look.  This car is very roomy, has stunning looks, and has great acceleration and speed!"
bentley,continental-flying-spur,2006,WJR, 02/18/2007,Spur vs. Arange,4,"I traded in my Arnage T for the Spur and never looked back. The Spur has everything I wanted (except no MP3 hook-up) in an auto. Although the Arnage T turned more heads (who cares) the Spur outdoes it in every way, especially the interior! The Arnage felt like getting into a space capsule (I'm 6'1"") and was in the shop a good amount...the Spur on the other hand, not a hiccup! It delivers flawless performance, comfort and design (although the back end is a bit odd to me). I believe to have finally found that love match between man and machine with the Spur. "
bentley,continental-flying-spur,2006,BobS, 02/23/2006,"Sheer Luxury, Built to Last",4,"Having owned quite an array of luxury vehicles over the past 30+ years I thought I'd become quite jaded. I loved my Jaguar XJ's but then moved on to the Mercedes S-class, owning 4 over the years (including a new 2007 for my wife). The time had come for something different--something which looks and feels superior. The Flying Spur is IT! No Mercedes sedan can compare with the WOW factor of this Bentley. And, the beauty, quality and craftsmanship of the interior places this car head and shoulders all others. While I have no doubt the 2007 S-class is the true standard of the world, there is a certain satisfaction in driving the much more exclusive Flying Spur.  It is a JOY!"
bentley,continental-flying-spur,2006,bb, 09/15/2006,Special Car,4,"I am very happy with this car.  Compared to my previous cars, the S55 CL65 and S550, this car is the best and gives you everything, like performance, looks, and ride quality. To sum it up I find myself looking for reasons just to drive it. The car has a way of making you feel special.  I see a lot of comparisons to the BMW 760Li and the S600, these are great cars but check out what they sell for only a year old.  They lose a lot of value very quickly.  I'm speaking from experience, I traded my '06 CL65 on the Bentley."
bentley,continental-flying-spur,2006,Dr Quick, 11/06/2009,DR. QUICK's Prescription for feeling good,4,"The car is amazing. You almost have to learn how to drive all over again because of the elevated performance. Love the weight and solid feel. The power is breath taking. Some lesser top brands seem to have more features, but nothing beats pulling up in Bentley. Nothing makes you feel more special."
bentley,continental-flying-spur,2006,perrie32, 12/20/2005,Outstanding car,4,"I traded in my 2005 GT since I thought the 4 door made more sense for an everday car.  Like the GT the interior is outstanding as is the overall build quality.  The Continental Flying Spur  is fun to drive even though it is a little less sporty than the GT.  It's more elegant.  It is very comfortable and has some nice features such as automatic trunk opener and cooled seats.  Also better it has doors, since they are not as heavy.  All in all, I have been very pleased with the car."

Other then that, it's a great all around car. It has excellent power (though there is some turbo lag at the bottom), a smooth ride, it corners very well for a 5,500 lb. car, the AWD is great in the rain, and it is far more of a head turner then a MB or BMW.  The interior is luxurious.  If money is no option then what the heck, you can't take it with you!       "

In the Continental Flying Spur, I have finally found a car that looks, drives, and sounds as good as the hype. It is heaven to drive and the quality is unbelievable. It was worth the wait. There is nothing like it on the road.  Its a sports car and a family sedan with class. "
bentley,continental-flying-spur,2006,MichaelF, 03/20/2006,Beats BMW 7's & MB600 Hands Down!,5,"The Flying Spur replaced our Mercedes V12 and BMW 7 series. There is no comparison. Power and handling in the Bentley is superb, however, the quality, craftsmanship and design is unbelievable. The electronics and navigation is intuitive, making the BMW ""I-Drive"" look far more complicated than it needed to be. Acceleration pins you to the seat. Because of all wheel drive in the Bentley, our recent snow/rain vacation trip was far more relaxing because road handling was exceptional. This will be the first of many Bentleys!"
bentley,continental-flying-spur,2006,Jesse, 01/21/2006,My Second Bentley,4,"I purchased a Continental GT in late 2004 and was extremely happy with it. Now, the Continental Flying Spur is the same car with more space and some added features.  The bluetooth phone (RAZR) works great.  I also like the cooling solar panel in the sliding roof, air cooled seat not just heated, very large trunk space, and more glass. This is a really great car to drive since it handles like a GT. It has a tight body with no rattles. Overall, the Flying Spur is superb."
bentley,continental-flying-spur,2006,craig29, 03/15/2006,Exquisite,4,"I'm totally excited about this car.  I've had and driven just about everything luxury and they all pale in comparison.  The Continental Flying Spur has plenty of room, power and styling.  My only complaint is that the bluetooth only works with Nokia phones and my Razer doesn't work on the system."
bentley,continental-flying-spur,2006,MaffiaDude, 04/20/2006,Will Never Buy A Mercedes Again!,5,"This vehicle is amazing.  I have previously ownes an S55 AMG and a CL500 and this car put's both to shame. When you press the start engine button it sounds a like an airplane engine starting. When you're going fast you think you feel as if you are going only 45 mph. It is a must have for any person wanting to ride in style. All of the seats massage you, plus they all have heating and cooling. The trunk is so big you could easily fit 6 bodies in there."

With it's distinctive elegant shape, outstanding build quality, sheer luxury, twin-turbo 550 HP performance, and great driving dynamics, the Flying Spur sits by itself at the top of the luxury sedan heap.  It's an amazing balance of understated capability, able to take five people in total comfort at up to 195 MPH (where, I don't know!), corner with SL's on Angeles Crest, and cruise Sunset Blvd. with the same quiet refinement of a Rolls Phantom, without the Kenworth-grill pretense.  As modern as an A8 Audi (it's cheaper cousin), the Flying Spur make no excuses!"

The wheels were not balanced properly for the first visit.  The air conditioner went out in 100 degree temps on a road trip.  It is a lovely car other than those problems, but it makes one wonder what is next.  There is a fabulous sound system on the car.  But the interior storage space is not large enough.  If I put in an XM radio, I would lose my one ashtray.  There is nowhere for change if that is gone.  It drives beautifully.  I can't wait to get out on the open road with this car. "

This car has exhilarating performance but lacks the technology that Mercedes or BMW have.  I needed to add satellite radio and I had to buy a special phone to work with the ""optional phone system"" to integrate with the car system.  Bentley you should be ashamed of yourselves nickel and diming your customers like that.

I love my Continental GT, but my Flying Spur is a joke. In other words, It's garbage. I bought it, spent a week with it, then returned it. I bought myself a BMW 760Li and now, because of my Flying Spur, am thinking of swapping it in for a Mercedes Benz SLR McLaren or a Mercedes Benz CLK 55 AMG, or maybe a SL 65 AMG. I don't know. Despite it's ""luxury"" name, I find my Audi A6 to be more luxurious. Everyone, though, is subjected to their own, personal opinion.  "
bentley,continental-flying-spur,2006,rick larson, 06/06/2006,Forget It,1,"Given that the Bentley arrived at the lot in December, but I got to give the car a good drive a couple of days ago, you might be wondering where it's been. Well guess what, it was in the shop. You can see it's not reliable at all, considering that the engine burned up twice, a lot of the technology, and etc., etc., etc. It also lags in acceleration. For those who are looking for a Supreme Luxury Car, look at the A8 W12 L or 760 Li. Right now, I've got a 760 Li in the making. "
bentley,continental-flying-spur,2006,Parple Lossh, 05/09/2006,I Am Disappointed,1,"Never a Bentley Again!  I've had it for a while now, and I think it's awful. It is so uncomfortable and heavy. I could have saved $40,000 and gotten a 2007 Mercedes Benz S600 and have been happier than I am with the vehicle that I purchased. For those who are looking for a luxury vehicle, look at the S600 or the Audi A8 W12 L more carefully. Everyone has their own opinion, though."
bentley,continental-flying-spur,2006,CaliforniaCarsOrg, 04/23/2006,Not Quite As Good As The...,3,"Mercedes Benz S600 or the BMW 760Li. The handling was fine, but we were a bit suprised to find out that the garage door opener is optional. This luxury car is beautiful, but if you want to buy an exotic luxury car, look at the S600 or the 760Li or the Audi A8 W12 L as well. The car is a bit heavy, so it didn't perform as well as it could. It's also uncomfortable in the rear seats, compared to the BMW 760Li. In some cases, it's better than the S600 and the 760Li, but overall, it's not quite as good."
bentley,continental-flying-spur,2006,Treo, 07/02/2006,"Its great, but...",3,"The car's performance rocks, it is just that now they have the Chrysler 300 with the exact same front grille (am I the only one that notices it?). The garage door opener is a disgrace, since it's not standard. The radio and navigation are great, and the comfort is great as well. It's a gas guzzler, alright (how does the 760Li get 22 mpg and S65 AMG 18 mpg?) Even though I love my Bentley a lot and probably would recommend this car, I'd recommend a Mercedes-Benz S600 or S65 more. "
bentley,continental-flying-spur,2007,2TimeBentleyOwner, 01/04/2017,"SAVE A BUNDLE - BUY ONE USED, SOLID PERFORMER",5,"Bought our 2007 used in 2016. Car was in great shape with 51,000 miles on it.  Paid $1,600 for Dealer to do maintenance of oil & filter change, and total review of car (more than a standard oil change at dealer, but did more as to changing out fluids, batteries in keys, etc. - was worth it to find out exactly what the car really needed)  Had about 10% left on Brakes. Replaced Brakes AND Tires (got them from Tire Rack) and went to independent mechanic to get things done (ABOUT HALF what Dealer would have charged)  The Trick with these cars is that you DON'T go to the Dealer - you go to good mechanic who knows Bentleys. Had an 1989 Bentley Eight for 20 years and traded it in for this one.  This car is SUPER fast and is comfortable. Better gas mileage than the 1989 BUT, you don't buy one for the Gas Mileage.  After putting on about 7,000 miles in a half-year, I would say it was a great buy.  No way could we afford a new one (total price w/tax about $240,000) but getting this car at $62,000 was a good deal. Oil Change is once every 10,000 (Synthetic oil, 14 quarts - YES 14)  It is a racing engine on a luxury platform. So much better than a Mercedes, BMW, or other High-end car. Repairs? So far just put on Brakes and Tires to insure we had solid traction.  Have had it up to 120MPH and it's like you are driving 55MPH.  I am surprised at some of the other negative comments. Maintenance is not bad if you DON""T go to the dealer.(and that is true on ANY car!!)  Find a good mechanic.  Join the Bentley Club and the Rolls-Royce Owners Club and you will get great tips in maintaining the car and not overpaying for service.  Bottom line - You're driving up in a high-performance Bentley and that makes everyone's Lexus, BMW, Mercedes, and Audi pale in comparison.  No one asks what year it is - it's a Bentley!

UPDATE: At 61,000 miles on the car.  Great car that gets a lot of notice.  Had a sensor problem with the Parking Brake warning going on. Very minor replacement (sensor).  Looking forward to entering it into the Rolls-Royce Owners Club's Regional Concours.  Glad we bought it.  If you buy one - DRIVE IT.  Don't let it sit in the garage.  These cars were built to be driven hard.

UPDATE:  At 62,300 miles on car.  Still great driving.  Had the air struts start losing pressure in the front. (this is the BIG repair that scares anyone from buying some of the exotics - not just Bentley, but high-end Mercedes and others as well). The air struts are like $2,800 apiece and the compressor is $1,100 PLUS installation at the dealer.  You're looking at about a $10-12K repair.  If you shop-around like I did, you can beat that price AND get quality parts (NEW - NOT refurbished) for a LOT LESS.   I bought a total kit for about $2,500 - BOTH Air Struts AND the Compressor. Even my mechanic said I got a steal on it.  I did not need to replace the compressor so I am saving that for the future but my total bill with installation was around $3100 (and I still have the new compressor in a box for the future).  That is  the way you can afford running a high-end exotic and not worrying about maintenance costs. That is the biggest repair on the car.  By a quality used car and learn how to be a  ""shopper"" and you can pull up in a true luxury performance car that originally cost $230,000 next to the guy who paid the same price for a mid-level, nothing spectacular  BMW new.

UPDATE - Have had car for a little over 2 years now.  Going for an oil change.  Great ride.

For not so much more than it's Audi sibling, the Bentley fit the bill. While it does have some electrical issues, none have been disabling. The ride is a bit noisy due to the high tire pressures and high performance tires. That said, the car is fairly quiet on the road. The 2009 models will be quieter. Acceleration is amazing, the interior is a wonderful place to be, and the car is quite easy to drive. The bluetooth is useless for Verizon customers. "

After 4 years with this car, we wish we'd never purchased it.
It often throws codes on startup, which will get expensive when the extended warranty expires.
Poor warranty service/aftercare is a nightmare on any item.
On a vehicle at this price point, it is an outrage.
It can be great fun to drive for such a huge sedan, but, without proper, kind, and ethical factory support, it's nothing more than atarted up piece of garbage we wish we'd never purchased"

My Flying Spur (which, when we purchased it, had never been owned by anyone but Bentley Motors and the dealer) now has paint peeling in a bunch of places, an inaccurate speedo, an inaccurate odometer, throws codes seemingly at random, and is now plagued by a shrill noise in the cockpit the dealer was too busy to fix prior to a 7000 mile trip.

I was a little dubious about buying this vehicle but when you put your foot on the accelerator and feel the movement the exhilaration is more than rewarding. Handles like a dream. You are in control every step of the way. Plenty of room and easy to adjust settings. Everything is intuitive. You do not need the owner's manual. Nothing is hidden. It is all up front and works like a charm. No MBA required. Comfort is unbelievable. Interior is first class as is the fit and finish. It's a very German car without all the quirkiness and regimentation of a Mercedes. Loose and fluid. Easy.
bentley,continental-flying-spur-speed,2012,Mark, 08/03/2015,over rated car ?,5,"I have had several high end cars, my main focus is 4 door luxury sedan, combined with performance, this is my 2nd flying spur, 1st one was a 2006 model, 25k miles, this car gave me a lot of problems, mainly confined to the info-tainement system, though a few major engine problems did occur.
Luckily it was under warranty, good job because it cost 20k plus had the front struts replaced, i sold it within 2 years.
I purchased a high end Mercedes AMG SUV, what a mistake, how i missed the bentleys serene ride,composed road manners, the overall feeling of luxury, and secure ride. I had to buy another, there are no words to describe how it feels, other cars just don't compare.
The Bentley is a very simple car  , there is no lane departure, brake assist,forward cameras, in fact you feel short changed in that department, but it you will not miss them, the is a simple elegance the other cars don't have, or replicate.

So i purchased the best i could, 2012 Speed, what an improvement on the 2006, much better car all round, more power, better seats, handling, just great.
Buy warranty if you can, or good after market service repair, low miles,  good service records are essential, and then enjoy the best ride of you life, in a way i regret getting the car, as everything else seems boring, and mundane, for the price of a new Cadillac Escalade, a used one makes sense, my car was $240k when new 3 years ago, i saved $135K over new, what a bargain. You only live once, go for it.

The 2005 has evil electrical gremlins! I got it in December 2014 with 14,800 miles. Two previous owners. First owner had it 8 years and managed to put only 4500 miles on it.  Second owner had it two years and put 9500 miles on it.  I put 4000 miles on it over about 2 1/2 months. Then it just died..literally.   the engine just shut down at a stop sign. Had to disconnect the battery cables to recycle the electrical system. I noticed on the service records that owner number one had a similar issue the first year of ownership.  I parked it for several months then drove it to my independent guy (where it died at a stop light 1/2 mile from the shop). All my sensor lights came on, Windows only rolled half way up. It was a mess. Been with my independent for 4 months  (he's good, but ridiculously slow). He believes it's a module board because he can hear relays clicking off and on in the battery compartment.

The driving experience is all that I expected and the quality of build inside and out is first rate.  Its performance is astonishing for such a heavy car but it translates to relatively poor mileage.  The stereo is great but sat/nav is fiddly to use and very basic in its features.  Servicing has been hassle free with all costs covered under the warranty and the dealership has taken care of any problems.  The rear seat accomodation is tight but if I wanted a 4 seater I would have got the sedan! All in all I am very satisfied with the car and it fulfilled all my expectations.  I highly recommended it."

By comparison, my 2004 Jaguar XJR is a delight to drive and a bargain-- at half the price, it's very fast, has MORE features, has never even required dealer service and handles with nimbleness the Bentley can't approach.  The Bentley is a stop-light ego builder, no doubt.  But it feels like a date with Madonna might feel-- everyone looks at her and envys you, but somehow when you're alone together you realize she's not the woman you want so spend your life with!"
bentley,continental-gt,2005,Dan Houk, 09/03/2015,Good looks can be deceiving,1,"Beautiful car that turns heads. Cost of ownership is very expensive. I have spent over $70,000.00 since I bought the car new in 2005. The repair cost doesn't count the items that needed repaired that were under warranty. This is my first and last Bentley GT
"
bentley,continental-gt,2005,KEITH, 05/21/2005,Bentley - Major Disappointment,2,"My Bentley Continental GT was tons of fun for about three months, but now every punk kid is driving one!  It has electronics issues galore.  Also, this is an extremely heavy car that does not handle like I had expected.  Its engine is superior, however its ergonomic design is not up to par either.  I should have bought the Aston Martin or Ferrari."
bentley,continental-gt,2005,John Telerico, 05/31/2005,Next Time Around Will Be Ferrari!,3,"The interior of the Bentley Continental GT is pretty, but it has no headroom even without a sunroof.  This car also has poor overall handling.  The engine is strong off the line and above 70 mph.  Its braking is no better than a Lincoln Navigator's.  The Continental GT is just too heavy.  If you are over 6 feet tall, forget about comfort.   Its quality has not met my expections, especially considering the fact that I had to wait a year for my ordered car to come in.  This is a good car, it's but far from great.  It truly does nothing great."
bentley,continental-gt,2005,Jimbo, 07/21/2005,As Good as it Gets,4,Awesome performance.. Had MBz for 25 yrs. -- build quality of the Bentley is awesome.  Dealership experience great.  Has some quirks -- what good (anglo/german) product doesn't.  It's a different level of ownership experience.  Service -- awesome.  Have my order in for Convertible -- only way anyone will get Gt out of my hands.  
bentley,continental-gt,2005,R. B. Tonkin, 06/07/2005,2005 Bentley GT,4,"I have only driven my Bentley Continental GT some 500 miles so far, but it has been flawless perfection thus far.  It has exceeded my expectations in every way.  Even fuel the mileage, which is low, is adequate as this car weighs over two and a half tons with over 550 horsepower. It is quiet, smell of leather is so pleasant, and tactile swithchgear is perfect."
bentley,continental-gt,2005,Overlord, 07/14/2006,Muscular torso in a Savile Row suit,4,"I bought this car for the interior and it doesn't disappoint - except perhaps the plastic display surround.  The leather and wood is heavenly and reminds you of the English craftsmanship clothing the largely German dynamics.  The latter is reassuring, since I have had an unpleasant ownership experience with an old school Brit supercar, the Aston Virage.  The car is undeniably heavy, but the 4wd deals well with the power, and good drivers can push it further than you might suppose.  However, dynamically it would be outpaced through the bends by some of my other cars - Ferrari 550, 911 Turbo, Noble (small volume English rocket!)  Still, for elegant trundling, it beats any Merc, BMW or Audi.  "
bentley,continental-gt,2005,D. A. Yergey, 09/03/2005,2005 Bentley Continental GT,5,"This car is the best car that I have ever owned. The performance is breathtaking. The finish work is superb. The interior is very usable. The back deat is far more usable than I expected, particularly for a 2-door. Even the GPS system is more usable than the Mercedes that I traded in. All in all I give it a near perfect score. Resale is excellent also."

bentley,continental-gt,2005,B. Olander, 06/04/2005,THIS IS IT!,4,"The 2005 Bentley Continental GT has outstanding build quality. Other manufacturers now need to play catch up.  Bentley has been able to maintain the ""Bentley image"" with help from the Volkswagen/Audi infusion of capital. This car's engine wants to run, with tons of hp and torque. The leather inside is of the finest quality. This model's limited production should keep it a classic. Except for the twin turbo charges, i believe W.O. Bentley himself would have approved of this car.  It has power, power, and more power in one really slick package."
bentley,continental-gt,2005,J. R., 04/18/2006,Love It,4,This is the car! I've owned a few luxury cars and a few Ferraris' and this car is a great compromise between an everyday driver and a weekend fun car. It's very practical for everyday use with loads of performance for those spirited drive times.
bentley,continental-gt,2005,Ken Dialo, 06/12/2005,Continental GT- Smoke and Mirrors,2,"This car took me a long time to receive. After 3 months not satisfied. Engine is strong, but does not prove out to alleged specs that are reported. Porsche all models will give it a solid run to 60mph.  Handling is sloppy, braking is not world class. Interior is beautiful, controls are nicely placed.  Overall I will purchase Ferrari or Aston on next trip around."
bentley,continental-gt,2005,TED G., 06/16/2005,One for the Ages,4,"While I waited for delivery, I asked an existing owner how he liked the the car; ""I don't like it.....I love it!"" End of story. It is clearly the best luxury porformance car I have ever owned. The blend of styling, performance and engineering is unsurpassed! I look for reasons to take the car out, it is that much fun to drive. I just took my first ""road trip"" through the mountain passes of Washington State and it handled flawlessly. This is as close to perfection as I have seen in a mechanical structure!"
bentley,continental-gt,2005,Blake, 08/01/2005,Bentley Continental GT,5,Smooth to drive and a LOT of horsepower. Before I bought the GT I test drove the Aston Martin DB9. Theres nothing like a Bentley compared to the DB9.
bentley,continental-gt,2005,bob, 01/29/2005,Bentley did it!,4,"I just picked up my Continental GT last week. I have only wonderful things to say about it.  It is an awesome vehicle with a great combination of power and luxury. I previously drove a Mercedes-Benz and cannot believe the difference in handling and power between it and my Bently. My only complaint is that the cupholders are not really functional, but I can live with that issue."
bentley,continental-gt,2005,Len Tweten, 02/15/2005,Golfer,4,"I have owned many fine cars and this Bentley Continental GT coupe is without doubt the very best car ever,  My wife loves it as well. There are twenty of them here in Bighorn. I traded in my Aston Martin for this car and an glad that I did."
bentley,continental-gt,2005,David, 04/15/2005,My take on the Bentley Continental GT.,4,"I enjoy the Bentley Continental GT very much. It may not be the fastest in acceleration or handle the best but it is an all around solid car that performs very well in all catagories. The fuel mileage is not very good but that is to be expected from a 5,300 lb. car with a twin turbo 6.0 liter engine. "
bentley,continental-gt,2005,R. Olander, 04/17/2005,Time in Motion,4,"Wow! The Bentley Continental GT is a new benchmark. The interior workmanship is excellent and the exterior looks great from the front and side views. Its rear legroom is a liitle skimpy, but Bentley delivers on the 1952 Continental R concept. This vehicle will be a real classic. It was worth the wait."
bentley,continental-gt,2005,Raul Juan Escudero, 05/28/2005,Artwork on Wheels,4,"The 2005 Bentley Continental GT is an extraordinary car. As an ultra luxurious coupe it has no rival, except for the Ferrari Scaglieti, which is an entirely different automobile and is significantly more expensive. It is luxurious with an understated flair.  "
bentley,continental-gt,2005,Donald G. Santucci, 07/07/2005,Bentenly Continental GT Review,4,"Over the years I have had the good fortune to have  owned a few exotic cars. While the Bentley GT does not have the, ""outer edge"",handling of some of the Ferriaris, Aston Martins and some other exotics, it is truly a high performance car, but without the harshness exhibited buy most of the other cars of it's breed. As for the over all handling, it should be more then adequate for 98 percent of the people out there that buy these kinds of cars. Personally I don't mind giving up some preformance, that I'll never need, for a little more refinement and creature comfort.    "
bentley,continental-gt,2005,anthony p browne, 05/08/2005,Bentley GT,4,"Get used to all the looks and whistles on the road.  The 2005 Bentley Continental GT is an eye catcher! Its performance is fantastic, and the roar from the exhaust tell you so. The old fashioned smell of leather and wood brings back memories. I'm 6'3"" and 210 pounda and this car isn't made for people my size but it's like shoes, if I like them I'll squeeze in. Nothing in this world is perfect, but this Bentley sure is close."
bentley,continental-gt,2005,perrie, 05/08/2005,2005 Bentley Continental GT - Love it,5,"The 2005 Bentley Continental GT is the greast ca in the world.  It's fun to drive, superior to my Mercedes-Benz S55 and almost as much fun as my Ferrari 360.  It has excellent build quality, pickup, and styling.  Iave already ordered a Bently Flying Spur.  This car is a real head turner."
bentley,continental-gt,2005,tom wartenberg, 07/16/2005,Best Car I've ever owned,4,"I'm a car junkie. I've owned every exotic and luxury car you can think of over the last 30 years, including a prior Bentkley Turbo R, which was a trash can that I dumped in 6 months.  This, however is the finest car I've ever deriven . Puts the big BMW, Mercedes as well as the Porsche's and Jaguars of this world to shame."
bentley,continental-gt,2005,charles winner, 07/18/2005,I love driving the car,4,I have several cars ranging from Aston Martin Vanquish to Mercedes to BMW and a Bentley Arnage. The GT is by far the one that I prefer to drive. I highly recommend it to anyone that can afford such a car.

bentley,continental-gt,2005,Herodotous, 06/17/2005,A Fine Car,3,"The 2005 Bentley Continental GT is a fine car to drive even though the electronics seem to act up once in a while. It joins my other fine cars: Lamborghini Murcielago, Ferrari 360, Aston Martin Vanquish, Porche Carrera GT, Ferrari 612 Scaglietti, Maybach 57 (custom made), and Mercedes SLR, with the last been the best but at $600,000 it is hardly the car to go shopping with! The Continental could probably lose some pounds as it detracts from its performance.  Overall, its not bad for a VW."

"
bentley,continental-gt,2006,Gil Amoroso, 08/14/2006,Fabulous Vehicle,4,I couldn't disagree more with the naysayers of this automobile.  It's not only beautiful and fast but it's great to drive.  It has superb handling for a heavy car but I'm not Mario Andretti.  The gas mileage is awful but what would you expect from a 550 hp vehicle?  A Prius it's not. Its build quality is great and I've had no problems so far.  It's a real head turner wherever I go.  .I'm very happy with the purchase.
bentley,continental-gt,2006,Ryan Andrews, 04/21/2006,The Bentley,5,"This is one fantastic car. It's fast, handles well, has great looks, and has a Bently badge which makes it that much better. I like to drive with the paddle shifters, tap the left one to downshift an the turbos propel you to great speed within seconds an lets you hit very high speeds, which doesn't take very long. Its steering accuracy is superb at all speeds which makes the car feel lighter than it is. It wieghs about 5,200 pounds, but the steering makes it feel like its a mere 2,100 pound Miata. The brakes never fade or give up, I went from around 80 to 0 mph with in a few seconds to avoid rear ending a car in heavy LA traffic, most cars would have squeky, faded brakes, this thing never gives up. I love it!"
bentley,continental-gt,2006,bob, 01/07/2006,Nothing Else Quite Like It,4,"Having been the owner of Merdedes, BMWs, Porsches, and quite a few others, the Bentley Continental GT is far superior in all aspects.  Its power can only be understood by being in the driver's seat. This car is ell worth the dollars. I give applause to the Bentley design team."
bentley,continental-gt,2006,2andout, 03/29/2008,2006 Bentley Continental GT,4,"Power, handling, braking is superb. Enough GVW to be classified as a light truck but nimble as a Ferrari in the turns. Quiet yet throaty. This is the best car in class that I have ever owned. Double insulated glass. Everything leather. Check out the interior trim. Hardly a sign of plastic anywhere. I rate this car based on performance, appearance, reliability. I give it 10+ in every category. It has bluetooth yet the iPhone does not work with it. The navigation in the 06 is by cd, not the greatest. Nobody's perfect."
bentley,continental-gt,2006,Roger Marchs, 01/21/2006,"Bentley Good, but Not Great",4,"The Bentley Continental GT is comfortable and darn fast.  However too its console contains too many shared Volkswagen/Audi parts.   Come on, for $165,000 I don't want the Audi controller, nor do I want two paired Volkswagen 6 cylinder engines bolter together for a total of 12.  This is a pretty car and its very comfortable.   It's almost great, but not quite there."
bentley,continental-gt,2006,THE CONSULTANT, 12/20/2006,A Bently is Still a Bently,4,"The Continental GT, which I have owned for two years, is an eye catcher.  If you seek attention, look no further, The car performs well for its size, but Bentley was a little careless with some of the interior features, none of which compromises the car's driveability.  For example, the seats really need more adjustment positions, the phone system is antiquated, and the command system leaves a little technology on the table, but other than that they did a great job."
bentley,continental-gt,2006,Let down by Bentley, 02/18/2007,Disappointed in Bentley,4,"This is a great car with one major exception. Using the phone, after you dial a primary phone number there is no way to dial an extension while driving. I can't use the car for business calls. The car sits in the garage. If you need to use this car phone to dial an extension after you dial your office, forget it. Make sure to check it out for yourself before purchasing this car. I would like to get a Flying Spur but with the phone the way it is, I'm getting a MBZ S600 or S65. Also, if you are tall the seat belt pulls down on your shoulder. Last, the air conditioning is weak. All this being said, this car is a GREAT drive."
bentley,continental-gt,2007,The Man, 08/29/2007,The Bentley that Reinvented the Name,4,"From the day that I took delivery of this car my life has truly become more interesting! I couldn't help but sit in the car for the majority of the first day, whether I was driving somewhere or I was in my garage. The interior is literally unparalleled in the current automotive market.  The outside is a perfect complement for the goregous interior. With sweeping lines that run the length of the car, the Bentley Continental GT still reminds me of the old carriage cars of the early ninties, which is so rare to see in modern cars.  The performance is amazing, handling, acceleration, and top speed are all great for a car that is as comfortable as it is, and that weights 5300 pounds!"
bentley,continental-gt,2008,pb, 12/05/2009,Best Car I have EVER owned,4,"Traded my 07 maserati QP for a new 2008 GT, the car is absolutely amazing, insane amounts of power and torque can be driven like a limo or spanked like a true sports car. The interior is the best I have ever seen, bluetooth works fine, back up camera is a great help, ride is silky smooth and in my opinion this is the sexiest car on the market today (with a 599 a close second). I have not yet driven the car in winter conditions, but the 7000 miles I have driven over the past 6 months have been most enjoyable..."
bentley,continental-gt,2008,jordegcam, 06/10/2008,Car of Cars,4,"Traded in my 2006 Maserati Gransport for a 2008 Black Bentley Continental GT Coupe. Wow! The styling is all at once beautiful, sporty, elegant, and eye-catching. While I miss the throaty roar of the Massy, the elegance and power of this Black Beauty is enthralling. The creature comforts, the interior, the modern features are beyond compare. This has to be the world's best car. The Bluetooth feature apparently has been improved, my iPhone works well with it seamlessly. The drive is comfortable, yet very powerful. With a 0 to 60 of 4.6 seconds and 552 horsepower, this is a far better buy than a Ferrari Scaglietti, in my opinion. No regrets so far after 5 days! "
bentley,continental-gt,2010,Steve D, 05/17/2010,"Fabulous, except...",4,"If you are in this class, you have some expectations.  The car is wonderful to drive, stunning curb appeal, and incredibly powerful.  Meeting those expectations.  However, the 7 year old BMW 745 Li I traded in had much more advanced electronics.  It gets a 5 in reliability because the battery drains from starting W-12 engine after about 10 days of around town driving and must be plugged into an external charger.  The car starts, but no stereo, SatNav or other accessories.  Overall, it is a thrill every time I start the car and all my friends always want me to drive them to dinner."
bentley,continental-gt-speed,2008,Gujju_Power, 03/21/2010,Excellent rocket but not so practical,3,"Owned tons of expensive cars, by far the easiest to drive with a powerful engine to boot. Excellent styling inside and out. It is like a rocket ship. People slow down to take pictures using their cell phones. But, yes, there is a but because when you spend $200,000 you expect the car to play MP3 CDs, don't expect rattling sounds from the headboard, and chirping sounds from the child safety clam in rear seat. You expect the car to be totally unique but not. It is uses the EXACT same technology as a VW Touareg I had owned. Check it. Side panels vibrate when radio is loud. The road noise is terrible. Worth the money as other cars like lambo and Ferrari not user friendly and cannot be driven daily."
bentley,continental-gt-speed,2008,Jeremy, 04/02/2008,Performance and comfort,4,"The Continental GT is an exotic car that can actually be driven everyday.  The Speed takes it up  notch.  Even faster and the optional carbon ceramic brakes are pricey, but offer stunning stopping power.   (The brakes also offer no noise, no brake dust, much lighter weight and will last for 180,000 miles!)  An elegant exterior and the interior sets a new standard in quality and detailing.   "

bentley,continental-gt-speed,2008,Dr. Joe, 06/07/2019,Arrive in style,5,"The Continental GT Speed which I own is a somewhat rough ride on irregular surfaces like we have in New Jersey because of our rough winters. I presume that this is because it is set up for extremely high speeds on 20"" rims and P-Zeros.   Nothing smoother on smooth highway surfaces.  Unbelievable power and smoothness.  Car doesn't really wake up until 92 mph when the airfoil on the back deck automatically pops up and you can actually feel the car squat down.  Really more power than you could ever need.  Regular Continental GT probably a better choice unless you are a macho man or want to take it to the track for some kicks and blow away the Porsches and Ferraris while riding in supreme luxury listening to the best stereo you ever heard in a car  with the A/C on full blast.

bentley,continental-gtc,2007,John Lander, 01/25/2008,GTC Bentley Quality Sinking Like Benz,2,"This vehicle has a beautiful interior, but that is about all I can say good about it.   Handling is reminiscent of my 10 year old Rolls.   I thought this car would be much tighter, and squeak free,  just not the case.   Electronic gremlins, including a very slow downshift automatic transmission.   Dealership says ""everything is normal"".  We will now be selling a pretty new car."
bentley,continental-gtc,2007,jim, 12/26/2007,Best of All 3!,4,"I've owned a GT, Spur and now the GTC and this is the best of all three. Better drive/ride/handling than the GT and Spur - AND, as of 2008 model, they've eliminated all the kinks/idiosyncs out of the electronics, esp. the phone and nav. system from the earlier models.  The GTC is a joy to drive and a head turner.  Build quality is better than ever and the sound system, in a word, spectacular.   The GTC is, in a word, masterful.   Even the Breitling clock is improved!"
bentley,continental-gtc,2007,Travis, 04/17/2010,Disappointed,3,"I just decided to treat myself, and while shopping came across an 07 with 15k miles on it, beautiful car, but the transmission was bothering me by the way it shifted on the test drive.  The sales rep swore it was normal, but after driving for the last 33 years, I know what a transmission should feel like. Decided not to get this one, but will continue to look."

I promise you'll be happy and proud you bought this car."

I am planning to get rid of my older Bentley GT because this one is so much fun to drive! The interior is the best part of the car. The leather is like no other car in the world! The GTC drives so nicely I prefer to drive this over my Rolls Royce Phantom. In my opinion this is Bentley's best car yet!

In my first week of ownership I have driven the car 500 miles and must share that I have never experienced the surge of emotion with any other of my cars. The GTC is really not a car.  It is a work of art that delivers complete satisfaction whether just admiring the beautiful composition of the design or pressing the V12 to its ultimate power range. Bentley nailed it.

This is an automobile that is as comfortable at 120 MPH as tooling around the neighborhood.  Superlative handling, nice exhaust note, power (@ 552 BHP!) Appointments are bar none.  Flawless reliability, fit and finish.  KILLER sound system and back up camera is well appreciated.  Top up or top down it's definitely at the top of my automotive list.  Never go back to MB again.

After driving mine for about a year now, all I can say is how timeless of a car it really is and will continue to be."

The car was sold to me with defective tires too. They had to replace them. It was in and out of the shop all the time. The dealer (Bentley Naples) was a nightmare to deal with as well. Filed Florida Lemon Law. Vehicle was bought back by Bentley as a ""manufacturer buy-back"". Got full refund. Would never buy a Bentley again or recommend this vehicle to anyone. They tried to make me a sign a non-disclosure document to prevent me making this public. I refused. They told me that is common practice. I asked why. They said to protect the brand name."

bentley,continental-supersports,2010,Jeremy, 04/15/2010,Supersport,4,"I purchased this as a replacement to a 2008 GT Speed.  Hard to believe that a few changes results in such a vastly improved vehicle.  Handling is outstanding, transmission is much crisper.  Drives like a Ferrari 599 with and auto transmission. Plus the iPod interface actually works. (finally!)  Black wheels and trim looks good, but not all exterior colors work.  Avoid browns and greens).  This is a unique vehicle.  Stunning performance, but with reliability and comfort that mean the car can be driven daily.  "

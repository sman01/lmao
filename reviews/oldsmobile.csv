oldsmobile,alero,2000,mcalpine, 01/24/2013,"About to retire black beauty after 291,000km",3,"I bought this car years ago used from a car dealer in Scarborough. It was very cheap (probably because of 5spd gear box and dent in hood) and my expectations were quite low. I just needed a car for the winter. It lasted a LOT longer than one winter. The 2.4l engine feels gutless in normal driving but when you put your foot down it picks up the pace nicely, albeit with plenty of noise which seems to be typical of GM four cylinders. I have full records of what has been replaced from new: Connecting pipe, small vacuum hose, blower motor resistor, rear window heating module, rear speakers, all struts/shocks/springs, gas cap, brakes x3 with new calipers, emerg brake cable, drivers seat back."
oldsmobile,alero,2000,chris, 11/03/2010,I'm going to miss this car,5,"My wife bought this car Brand New from the dealer. we've had it for 10 yrs now and its been wonderful. Very few problems the fuel pump went at 70k which i hear is very common, and we've replaced all the power window switches. everything else is great, very fun to drive and very roomy. I'm trading it in and I'm going to miss this car."
oldsmobile,alero,2000,mountaintop1, 11/14/2011,2000 alero after 11 years,4,"This has been a great car, great mileage, and very little problems. 108000 miles so far, can't complain I will be buying a new car soon, I hope it will be as good."
oldsmobile,alero,2000,Becky, 10/30/2007,Oldsmobile NEEDS to Replace every Alero,1,"I bought my vehicle in June of 2002, thus far I have replaced brakes, rotors, intake gasket, waterpump, fuel filter, power steering pump, and now my transmission is slipping, have any of you realized that there is n o way to check the transmission fluid on your own? Not to mention the tires I have had to replace. The dashboard is raised due to sun damage. It appears to me that a bunch of monkeys could have done better when they decided to build this car. I had contacted Oldsmobile many times and they seem quite content that a bunch of fools like us made them rich. The car is paid for, but the repair bills are adding up. I will NEVER buy AMerican Made Again!!!!!!!"
oldsmobile,alero,2000,Wildplrbear, 11/07/2009,Trash Heap,2,"I have owned this car for 6 years and treated it like an old man would. It did not love me back, it constantly bit the hand that feed it. The car is horribly constructed. It has built in flaws that are unfixable and dangerous. It completely broke down with 112000 miles. By break down, I mean it gave up on life. I do not believe it is even ok to sell this car to someone. I plan on taking it to a junk yard and asking them to destroy it. Did not start 15% of the time because of security system issues, new bearings every 15K miles, windows that stop working every winter, bad head gaskets, bad intake gaskets, new breaks every 20K miles, shorting wires on a semiannual basis."
oldsmobile,alero,2000,Patrick, 07/05/2008,Stay away from GM,3,"Major repairs: Transmission blew up at 95,000 miles, although 80% of my driving is on the highway.  Replaced fuel pump at 60,000. Minor repairs: Two stuck front calipers.  1 front wheel bearing, intermittent driver side power window. Leaking intake gasket and transmission gasket. Power steering hose disconnected.  Fan resistor replaced twice.  I do expect the car to have some things to fix once in a while, but I do not accept a premature transmission or fuel pump failure.  GM, you fooled me."
oldsmobile,alero,2000,rjwolps, 09/15/2002,Great Car,5,"I love my Alero.  I have had it a 
little over 2 years and have about 
65,000 miles it.  It runs great and I 
get about 34 mpg on the highway.  It 
is very comfortable and fun to drive.  
It is a very good car for the money.  
The only complaint is the same 
compliant that I have had for other 
Olds' products - the brakes.  They 
don't last and the rotors warp too 
easialy.  I have a lot of miles on my 
car, but they are almost exclusively 
highway miles.  The original brakes 
should have lasted a lot longer than 
about 40,000 because I don't use them 
that much."
oldsmobile,alero,2000,ihateGM!, 09/24/2010,GM fooled me once but never again!,2,"This was my first new car buy ever. Peeling dashboard at 36K miles, rack & pinion and tie rods needed replaced at 38K miles.  And I'll spare you all the other repairs under $500.  Yes, I'm still driving it after 10 years, but when your car has $0 trade-in value at year 4, what choice does one have?  (The dealer says to replace the dashboard is over $2000 to repair).  My father was UAW and I never thought I'd say this but my next car won't be an American brand.  GM, shame on you!  The government bailout money will be the last penny of mine you'll ever get from me."
oldsmobile,alero,2000,Tickedoff, 07/14/2002,Thank god for warranties,3,"I own a 2000 gls, brakes are horrible, 
windshield leaks, problem w/turn 
signals (would not turn on until 
hazzard switch pressed several times)
Not to mention it's not worth anything!"
oldsmobile,alero,2000,Espfire, 07/25/2002,Great car for less!,4,"I feel the Oldsmobile division has 
taken a major criticism for a lineup 
that rivals Buick and Pontiac.  
Redesigned cars from the year 2000.  
The models have been safe, reliable and 
have outstanding body designs.  Though 
a little behind in overall quality from 
Toyota and Honda, it really outshines 
Ford and the previously mentioned GM 
divisions.  It will be a shame to see 
Oldsmobile go.  People were catching on 
to the new look and feel of Olds and 
now GM simply gave up on a lineup that 
was making headway in a full market. "
oldsmobile,alero,2000,kuld@N.J, 08/02/2002,YOU'LL BE SORRY............I WAS !!!!!!!,2,"Where do I start???It all started at 
7000 miles.Matter a fact,it is still 
going on.The car was to the dealer 
about 13 times already.The problems 
were;check engine light(dealer said it 
was only gas cap problem,The next day I 
broke down on the highway.It turns out 
the guts inside the catalitic converter 
broke apart.It took 9 trips to the 
dealer to figure that one out and a 
lawyer.When that went so did the 
muffler.The light came on again,this 
time oxygen sensors blew.From there on 
the car has been back for a 
alternator,door gasket,gas cap problems 
and a fan motor next week."
oldsmobile,alero,2000,Vipersaint, 03/01/2002,Alero Happy,4,"Car is a nice size and handles exceptionally well for a sedan.  Reasonable acceleration(this from a former Viper owner).  Have heard of issues with brakes but no problems yet as of 31,000 miles.  Reliable.  Leather is cheap and will tear.  Nevertheless, can recommend this car to anyone."
oldsmobile,alero,2000,ready to get rid of , 06/18/2003,don't do it,3,"At 9000 miles, brakes went out on me 
three times. Had to replace brakes a 
rotors. At 23000 had to replace fuel 
pump, at 31000 replaced power steering 
pump. Doors stay messed up, have had 
three of the four doors fixed at 
different times. Fuel gauge is off, 
have to find a station at little over 
quarter tank. Drivers window won't roll 
down, already fixed passengers window 
in back also.Its gonna cost over three 
hundred dollars to fix the window. Pass 
side door stays stuck now. Door locks 
possessed, they click locked unlocked 
on their own continuiously, have to 
take out the fuse to get them to stop. 
Lots of road noise also."
oldsmobile,alero,2000,mountainman68, 09/09/2003,Bye-bye Olds,3,"Maybe it is good GM is axing Olds. 
This was a ""program"" car, so maybe it 
was abused before we got it, but 
before 75000 miles we had a motor 
mount break, coolant leak from intake 
manifold, 3 full brake jobs, twice in 
shop for driveability - one was an air 
sensor. Don't remember the other 
problem. Continuous intermittent 
electrical problems that dealer can't 
find. I'm glad I bought an extended 
warranty. (too bad the brakes weren't 
covered) I do like the sporty styling 
and V6 performance, but interior is 
too small and car cannot be trusted. I 
will be trading it in the very near 
future. I will not be buying another 
GM product. Period."
oldsmobile,alero,2000,Katy, 01/01/2005,WORST CAR EVER!,2,"My 2000 Alero has been a nightmare!  Six months after buying it I had to have the brakes replaced (two more times since then).  The dash board and door upholstery is peeling up, I've had to have three of the motors replaced in my power windows ($200 per window), the alternator has been replaced twice, and have had numerous electrical problems.  This is the worst car I have ever had!   "
oldsmobile,alero,2000,nick, 03/13/2005,Worst Car I Have Ever Owned!,3,"This looked like a really nice car.  The first year changed that!  Constant brake problems, transmisson problems, and broken interior switches.  After about 4 years and 80,000 miles all sorts of things went wrong!  I replaced alternator, starter, fuel pump, wheel bearings, and the ignition system( because a cheaply made plastic cover cracked and fried the whole system!)  Olsmobile would look for any reason not to honor the warranty and were constantly difficult to deal with!  I can see why they went out of business.  It is too bad, I paid a lot of money for a very poorly made car and I will never buy American again!  It is really too bad!  "
oldsmobile,alero,2000,CAUTION!!!!, 03/19/2005,CAUTION!,4,"Bought my Alero because I had rented one once and fell in love with its performance and ride.  It is really fast for a coupe.  If you are considering buying one from a dealer you better get the extended warranty!  I have replaced the rotors on the front (big problem with Aleros). The lower intake gasket leaked so that screwed up the antifreeze. The resistor that controls the blower motor burned out. There is a rattling noise in front suspension that I can't seem to find. Fortunately I got the extended warranty!  I'd be out a few thousand if I hadn't.  Depreciation is ridiculous!  Paid $11,000 for it in 2002 and its now worth $6,000 retail/$4,000 trade.  I owe $8000. "
oldsmobile,alero,2000,Unhappy, 10/15/2005,Wish I hadn't,3,"I bought an Oldsmobile Alero because of it's easy handling.  I wish I hadn't.  Luckily some of the problems have been covered under the warranty, but now that's up and I might as well have a car payment with the money I spend on the thing.  I've replaced the rotors, brakes, cruise control and much more.  The interior is falling apart with the upolstery sundamaging very very easily. I wouldn't recommend this car to anyone at all."
oldsmobile,alero,2000,danny, 04/04/2006,Not the best,3,"It may look good, but the 4-cylinder engine in the Alero was not made to last.  I have had so many small problems with this car, it is a big headach.  Furthermore, the interier is very cheap the dash looks like a raisin.  If you buy a vehicle, buy a better class."
oldsmobile,alero,2000,Lynette, 03/21/2003,"Like the car, but not the problems",4,"I liked how it looked(sort of like a 
Mustang).The first year I had my gear 
shift break.  I did have problems with 
my turn signal. It wouldn't work, 
unless I hit the hazzard lights and 
then turn the hazzard lights off 
quickly. ROTOR problems...it eats them 
up! I found out that it is actually a 
design problem that I think GM should 
have a recall on. The tires are not 
rotating straight, but at an angle, 
like a shimmy....they need to shim the 
rotors to fix the problem...but of 
course you'll have to pay for it!
The tires will cost you about $500.
 It's hard to tell when the AC light is 
on in the day time. The dash is peeling 
on the driver's side."
oldsmobile,alero,2000,us_blueskirt, 10/02/2006,3 Year Update from 11/09/03 Post,3,"The milage and performance has dramatically decreased over the last year!  The only real issue outside of that was a problem with the flasher system, which was fixed by a factory recall on the assembly.  I can't really complain about the performance...It's got just over 165,000 miles on it. The performance didn't waiver until it hit around 120,000 miles, but it's been downhill since then.  I keep up with all 'scheduled' maintenance and it seems to work for this car.  It is very reliable...I still take long trips on a regular basis!"
oldsmobile,alero,2000,hatethiscar, 11/18/2006,Do Not Buy This Car,2,"I bought my Alero in 2002. The drivetrain has been fairly reliable except for some suspension problems. The real problem for me has been with the interior bits.  Among other things, I've run into:  1. Two speakers inexplicably stopped working. The worked just fined once I replaced them (with original wiring even).  2. The A/C controls are messed up. The fan will only work on the two highest settings.  3. It has a peeling dash.  4. I have four (count 'em!) non-working power windows. I've had both front windows repaired multiple times, but they never seem to work longer than 6-8 months before failing again. This is, far and away, the most annoying problem I've had with the car. "
oldsmobile,alero,2000,ScottCAL, 03/06/2002,What happened to quality?,2,"I leased this vehicle prior to Oldsmobile being phased out by GM.  Now two years into the lease I can see why.  Over the past 2 years I have had my rotors replaced twice, struts replaced, electrical problems and numerous body/integrity issues.  This is not a low end nor cheap vehicle but the problems have been way too numerous and bothersum.  Next time I'll looking to Toyota, Honda or even Subaru - I'll try my luck with them..."
oldsmobile,alero,2000,Radkor, 11/11/2007,Tale of an Alero,5,"I bought my '00 Alero w/32000 mi in May '01 as an rebuildable. This car  has been great! 37mpg. Fuel regulator replaced under warranty, Frt brakes & rotors rplcd at 50k, rears at 70k, tires every 55k. Replaced poorly designed pass dr window regulator for $70 via boneyard. $80 flasher was to be rplcd under warranty but GM stopped that because it was a rebuilable. I love that car, everyone thought the factory 8 spker CD was aftermarket, it is that good! I was never tired after 9hr drives, and I have a bad back. I beat that car, I learned how to do 360s in the Red Hot Rod, what my kids called it. drove 4yrs. Its my daughters' now."
oldsmobile,alero,2000,texweber, 02/26/2003,maybe mine's a lemon?,3,"I'd had my eye on Alero's for quite 
awhile, and was very impressed with how 
affordable they were and the features 
that were included.  I have a 2000 
model with about 65K on it, and 
unfortunately have spent too much money 
on all kinds of maintenance problems.  
Less than a year into the buy I had to 
have the rotors and tires replaced, and 
a year after that I'm in a world of 
hurt with a new thermostat and 
potentially a gasket leak.  It's fun to 
drive, and I've been more than happy 
with it up til recently, but don't have 
a lot of faith in it anymore.  Maybe 
it's just the V6, but I can't keep gas 
in the thing either."
oldsmobile,alero,2000,JP in MO, 05/21/2003,2000 Alero GLS,4,"Much to my surprise, this Alero has 
great acceleration and passing speed.  
The ride is smooth and relatively 
quiet, except for a few interior design 
flaws within the speaker panels in the 
doors.  Overall, I am very pleased and 
still find myself excited to drive it 
either around town or on a long trip."
oldsmobile,alero,2000,bquintan2000, 05/19/2003,Great Car,4,"I have owned the Alero GLS for the past 
3 years and have been very pleased with 
the car.  Like everyone else, my rotors 
went bad and had to be turned.  
However, that did not occur until 
43,000 miles.  The car handles great at 
high and slow speeds.  Great interior, 
but will recommend having leather as 
oppose to the cheap cloth seats.  I 
have never had to take my Alero to the 
shop since I purchased it 3 years ago.  
My Alero was supped up by the dealer 
and everybody mistakes it for a 
Mustang.  Depreciation is poor.  Did 
not retain its value, very disappointed!"
oldsmobile,alero,2000,redlovely1, 06/13/2003,Do Not BUY THIS CAR!,3,"I was in love with my Alero when I 
first bought it.  However, it's safety 
rating dropped and my auto insurance 
increased.  Also it has this annoying 
clicking noise behind the hazard switch 
that the dealerships could not fix 
while it was under warranty and I took 
it 3 times.  They kept changing the 
hazard switch, but the clicking 
continued.  This car had lots of power, 
but with high miles (mine had 77K) it 
is worth $1 and starts having problems 
other cars would have at 100K +.  
Brakes were an issue. "
oldsmobile,alero,2000,grimbaldi, 07/07/2003,Too many flaws!!!,3,"I purchased my Alero GL equipped with 
the 2.4L engine 2DR with approx. 19,000 
miles on it as a program vehicle.  
Within the 1st 6 months of owning this 
vehicle I had to have the following 
items fixed/replaced:
Replaced Struts
Reseal rear windshield
Re-mount trunk Deck lid
Driver's side window fell into door 
(broken power window mech.)
Had to replace Rotors @ 38,000 miles

Aside from these problems the car has 
not been too bad thus far. Engine & 
road noise is a considerable detriment 
to this car.  Also the deflation of the 
car's value has been extremely 
disappointing!!!  This car becomes 
practically worthless not long after 
owning it."
oldsmobile,alero,2000,Robyn, 03/20/2008,"Watch out for 80000, its a doozy!!",2,"I love the way my car looks and handles (it's the 3.4L v6 coupe) I do not like the way the intake manifold gasket fails, the dash peels or the control arm bushings squeak. Nice power (can beat the boys at a light, is quick off the line)and huge sunroof, but can prove costly when repairs are needed. "
oldsmobile,alero,2000,CAR CRITIC, 03/27/2002,Alero GLS,3,"I HAVE A 2000 ALERO GLS THAT HAS V6. EXCELLENT POWER WITH EXCEPTIONAL GAS MILEAGE (30 MPG HIGHWAY). THE BAD PART IS TORQUE STEER. THE CAR DOES NOT STEER WELL UNDER FULL THROTTLE. MY GLS MODEL HAS THE INTERIOR OF A MUCH MORE EXPENISVE CAR.  MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT IS WITH BRAKES.  THE NEW PADS EAT ROTORS LIKE CRAZY.  THE CAR HAS TONS OF LIGHTS ON THE DASH TO TELL EVERY LITTLE PROBLEM IT HAS WHICH COME ON TOO FREQUENTLY. THE DECK LID ALSO LEAKS INTO THE TRUNK WHEN IT IS OPENED AFTER A GOOD RAIN. THE CAR IS VERY FLASHY FOR ITS PRICE RANGE, AND HAS GREAT POWER WITH THE V6, BUT THE CAR COULD USE SOME REFINEMENT ESPECIALLY THE BRAKES."
oldsmobile,alero,2000,lbsorensen, 05/16/2008,Nice Car,4,"I bought this car 6 years ago.  The kids were much smaller then.  Now that they are leggy teens, the back seat is small for 3 of them.  But I find that  the car is a great family vehicle. nice body style, and fairly peppy."
oldsmobile,alero,2000,Steph, 06/19/2009,It was a good car when I was 18!,2,I have had this car for 5 years now.  So far I have replaced the brakes/roters every year.  I had to replace the radiator in 04'.  Recently it has been constantly overheating.  I went in today and they told me the head was cracked and the pistons were loose!  I have put more money in repairs then what I bought it for!  Off to the dealership to by a different car!
oldsmobile,alero,2000,SkaterHick, 12/24/2009,B-E-A-UTIFUL!,5,"Over all an amazing car. Reliable, handles well in the snow, and over all speedy. the only draw backs would be a wavy interior on the dash."
oldsmobile,alero,2000,Matt Terpstra, 08/08/2002,Olds Alero is Great!,5,"the alero is an awesome car for the 
money. great looks and a blast to drive.
too bad they're going away."
oldsmobile,alero,2000,S. Racer, 12/24/2004,Former Toyota Owner,4,"My first car ever was a '72 Nova SS.    The mechanic saw this car more than I did.  This experience made me vow to never own an American car.  I've owned 4 Toyotas, including an MR2 (best car I've ever had).  When the Alero came out, I had to go back on my vow.  I currently am driving a slick looking black V-6 coupe.  Only major problem I've had was a power steering leak.  Besides this, my Alero's quality build has been much better than what I expected.  The power under the hood is scary (I'm thinking about getting a radar detector).  Seating is good in the front AND the back.  The styling is terrific!  Beware: This car drinks gas like crazy.  Besides this, it's a very fun & cool car to drive."
oldsmobile,alero,2000,My Review, 07/20/2005,Good Solid Vehicle,5,"I bought my '00 Alero brand new.  I was going to purchase a Grand Am, but once I drove the Alero, I knew it was the right choice.  I have the GLS V6 2- door.  I don't know if this is different than some of the bad reviews I've read on this site or not, but my Alero has been great.  I have 140K miles on it, and my mechanic says that it is still running strong.  I feel it is a solid car."
oldsmobile,alero,2000,bmatheis, 03/19/2003,I LOVE THIS CAR,4,"Bought this car new and it has 70,000K

to do on it is regular maintance and i 
am not babying it!"
oldsmobile,alero,2000,Art, 11/29/2006,More Than the Camry,5,"I have had my Alero for five years with no problems. I prefer the handling and safety features over my sister-in-law's newer Camry. The only small problem has been brake rotor warping, which is common on all cars with ABS brakes in our hilly area. It is also a wonderful towed vehicle, behind the motor home. The automatic lights are great. "
oldsmobile,alero,2000,ang, 01/03/2007,Still Lovin' it...,3,"So, I bought this car for it's looks. I'm still loving it. I had to replace its brakes and rotors, my husband says I ride the brakes though.  Also, I had to get a new water pump in 2004. To get to the point...I have three young kids and am a full time student, this car keeps up with all of us and has never left us on the side of the road!  We do live in a hilly area and sometimes find that the tranny slips going up steep hills.  I too love the automatic lights and convenient map lights. Oh, when I got this car it was missing the hazard lights?  I'm not sure what that was all about."
oldsmobile,alero,2000,lisa, 02/06/2007,Reliable and Stylish,4,"I never had a problem with either one of my Aleros. I owned a '99 and then a 2000! Oldsmobile finally came out with a beautiful, fun car that blew Pontiac and Buick out of the water. "

thing replaced was a fuel regulator. 
Gets 34mpg hwy/ 24city. Keeps up w/ the 
best from Germany. Still has the 
original BFG's with 55k miles. With

oldsmobile,alero,2000,A-guy, 05/06/2003,It's not a Honda,4,"Purchased this car new and have had my 
share of ups and downs. Fortunately, 
the car had been under warranty. for my 
share of problems: Warpped rotors, leak 
in windshield, buckled material on the 
dashboard,  leak in pass/rear door 
seal, rt ft shock mount. * never 
stranded. Now I am worried about 
what is to become of this car for the 
next few years. Not to mention the 
value. The rapid depreciation is main 
reason why I still own this car, the 
other reason is that, aside from all of 
the problems, I really love the car. 
There is something about it that allows 
me to look past the problems. Hopefully 
I will not have any major issues to 
change my mind. "
oldsmobile,alero,2000,Ed P., 03/22/2018,Keeper,4,"Good car. Had a couple small fixes by the dealer (fan switch, hazard button), crankshaft position indicator by independent shop, nothing major.  Might be not the best for long trips, front seat a little firm. Easy on tires and brakes.

oldsmobile,alero,2000,Nathan Leutzinger , 10/04/2019,Great car for a teenager!,5,"If your looking for a car that runs till 300-400k miles without a engine or transmission going this is the car. Have had to fix a couple things but nothing expensive, small miner things. Break pads, ignition starter, alternator, etc but nothing expensive. Old car. Price for parts are cheap. I had a relative that had this car and it ran till 400k then the engine went. Great car for a teenager that just needs a car to get to point A to B. Engine is great get the 3.4L 6cy, great engine any mechanic will tell you that. The 2.4L 4cy however is JUNK! My 6cy alero has 165k on it and I still love it. Nothing big went out. Great car. Don’t listen to these other people! If you take good care of the car it will last you forever."

oldsmobile,alero,2000,kr, 10/13/2008,Great car!,5,"I have owned this vehicle for almost 8 years.  I bought it in 2001 and it only had about 9000 miles on it.  It was previously a rental car out of the state of Washington.  This car still runs almost like new!  I change the oil every 3000 miles and do basic maintenance (very minimal).  This car has had a security problem (fixed for about $300.00 with no other problems), and also has had the rotors replaced 2x but I guess that should be expected with 180,000 miles.  This has been a GREAT car and I would highly recommend it.  I am even considering buying another when this one finally quits.  "
oldsmobile,alero,2000,lovedmyalero, 05/07/2002,loved it!,5,"I just traded in my alero gl 4dr for an 
suv.  But I really miss it!  The car 
was fun to drive.  I put 30,000 miles 
on it with just some minor problems all 
covered under the warranty.  It can do 
0 to 60 in just seconds.  It's fast, 
racey and great looking.  I feel like 
I'm driving a sports car.  Too bad they 
are not made anymore.  I had to trade 
it in because I needed a 4wd car.  But 
otherwise, I loved it and I miss it."
oldsmobile,alero,2000,Mackenzie, 05/13/2002,Great car,5,"This car is fun to drive and performs

half with no major issues.  Few minor 
issues (w/ cd player) That were all 
under warranty and fixed correctly by 
the Dealer ship the First time."
oldsmobile,alero,2000,ms.cheski, 03/03/2009,Love My Coupe!,4,"I have had this car for about 18 months now and love it! This car had nearly 77k miles on it when purchased and we're up to 106k. I have the V6 motor and it has some serious power.  Gas mileage isn't spectacular, but we're not too ginger, either. Around town we get 22-24, highway we've gotten up to 27 when she's all tuned up. Its solid and does well in the snow, too. There have been a couple issues with tie rods and once our rotors were practically rusted through- but I think they were cheap parts as we have not had the problem again. There is some issue with a few sensor lights coming on even tho nothing is wrong-I just ignore it. Only trading in because I'm pregnant and we need four doors."
oldsmobile,alero,2000,jon, 07/14/2009,Great car,4,"This is a good strong car built by GM. I've driven it to the ground and have had to replace rotors, a/c and a few electrical components. It's definitely a well-built car. I've experienced some problems mentioned by other people here, such as the peeling dash, and some paint problems on the hood, but otherwise I'm satistied with the car. In town mpg is about 20 when I drive like a madman, but on the highway i get closer to 36mpg. Pretty good for a car with decent umph. Steering, throttle and breaks a lot more responsive than many japanese cars that i've drive. "
oldsmobile,alero,2000,Bradley James, 07/12/2002,Good Car,4,"I have had very few problems with this 
car, I had a bad multifuntion switch 
that caused the turn signals not to 
work, but it was fixed under warenty.  
The only other complaint i have is that 
it is a four cyl. but it gets worse gas 
milage than most 6 cyl. cars, and also 
the 4 cyl. motor is quite noisy"
oldsmobile,alero,2000,Mr. Markus, 09/24/2002,Good Car,4,"This has been a very good car overall.  
Especially like the traction control 
and ABS.  On the highway this car gets 
over 30 miles to the gallon, with the 
air conditioner on.  Small problems, 
strut broke, driver window power motor, 
but all were fixed with the warranty."
oldsmobile,alero,2000,GLS Owner, 12/18/2002,2000 Alero GLS Sedan,4,"Within the first 9000 mile iI realized 
that I can't get more than 24 miles to 
the gallon and my rotors were warped, 
although I had plenty of pad left.After 
4000 more miles(twice) I turned them at 
my own cost. Then had to replace them 
all. My right side driver seat bolster 
pulled off so I am driving around with 
a metal bar against my back.The problem 
is WARRANTEE and SERVICE no car is 
perfect!"
oldsmobile,alero,2000,rmc, 12/21/2002,A little short on quality,4,"The good: torquey engine, handling, 
braking (but see below); exterior 
paint/finish/styling; sound system.  
The bad: front brakes replaced at 28K 
miles-- rotors warp easily & sound 
creaky; interior material 
cheap/unrefined; poor seal on driver's 
side door caused sound system to short 
out on wet days; hazard switch went 
through dash (the last straw).
Overall: A pretty good car with nice 
features that lacks refinement & 
compromises a little too much on 
quality.  Was not sorry to let mine go 
after 56.5K miles."
oldsmobile,alero,2000,Aubreysdad, 07/23/2003,Stay away from this car.,2,"Bought used from CarMax dealer.  After 
two months (only 29k miles on car), 
fuel pump has to be replaced, side 
mirror breaks off and replaced, dash 
starts peeling away and repaired, 
shifter nob breaks and replaced.  Sure, 
a little less expensive than Japanese, 
but you'll pay more in the long run.  
Went back to CarMax, took $1800 hickie 
on appraisal, and traded in for Honda."
oldsmobile,alero,2000,Jagster, 07/28/2003,Don't Love It As Much As BMatheis,4,"Although I love my car, the doors leak 
during hard rain and has been in the 
shop over 8 times for them to try to 
fix with no resolution. My 
brakes/rotors have been worked on 
twice, were replaced the second time 
before the vehicle reached 26000 miles! 
I will not buy another GM vehicle, but 
I have to admit that I love my car... 
it's my first new car and I've gone 
through too many of the same problems 
in less than 3 years of ownership."
oldsmobile,alero,2000,Alero Boy, 08/18/2003,Fits Like a Glove,4,"I bought my first Alero GLS Sedan in 
2000.  I loved this car since I first 
saw it in 98 at the Auto Show.  It's 
a good mix sportiness 
and class.  The brake rotors are 
worthless.  I went through 4 sets, all 
during the warranty.  The intake 
manifold gasket needed to be replaced 
at 50k, which was after warranty 
period.  I sold 4 of my friends on 
Alero & they also had the same 
problems and nothing more.  I traded 
in for an 03 GLS Coupe this passed 
February to take advantage of the $5000 
in rebates I qualified for.  Too 
bad GM is dropping Olds; it's the only 
division that actually has 
what it takes to compete with the 
imports."

oldsmobile,alero,2000,Craftina, 08/20/2003,Do your research before purchasing,3,"We bought this car when it was already 
a year old with about 36K miles on it.  
About 2 months after we got it, the 
radio has this problem where it won't 
stay programmed.  We have to turn it on 
every single time we turn the car on.  
The dealership didn't know why it was 
doing that, so it never got fixed.  It 
just left my familystranded on the high 
way after the fule pump went out in the 
middle of Alabama (we lived in NC.  
That among various other repairs needed 
that I don't have room for.  Just do 
your research."

and I have to commute 100 miles a day. 
The car has been great.  I do all of my
service to the vehicle.  The performance
and reliability is all there.  I have to
count on this car daily.  I have not had
any major mechanical flaws.  The only
problem was the passengers window
regulator went out on the vehicle about
60,000 miles.  Currently I have 87,000
miles on the car.  I highly recommend
changing the fuel filter frequently
about every 20,000 miles.  The car is
close to being stock; I have a K&N air
filter and Bosch 4 prong platinum plugs
which made a difference in performance
and fuel economy.  I am very pleased
with this car. "
oldsmobile,alero,2000,c34j46, 09/19/2003,Several problems ruin a nice car,3,"The rotors made by GM are junk and 
should have been recalled but GM 
refused to recall the part.  My new 
brand new rotors and pads were 
pulsating after only 3500 miles. My 
turn signals would not 
work at least once a week and then 
magically start to work again so the 
switch needs to be replaced.  Rear 
stabilzer bars had to be replaced to 
stop the annoying squeak the car would 
make after even the smallest bumps in 
the road.  
I'm looking to buy some aftermarket 
rotors which hopefully will last more 
than 3500 miles.  I think the brakes on 
my ten speed bicycle would have stopped 
the car more efficiently than the junk 
GM puts on the car."
oldsmobile,alero,2000,FootballMom, 10/06/2003,No More Olds,2,"The worst car I have ever owned. The 
brakes are a continual problem. The 
gear shift button has been replaced. 
The cruise control is broken. The rear 
door upholstery is peeling up. And last 
but not least, the dash board is 
peeling. The Olds dealer says it was 
caused by the sun and will cost $1200 
to repair and my car is only worth 
$3500. GM Customer service says since 
my car has 90,000+ miles on it, they 
will not do anything about it.  I told 
them my 94 Toyota Camry and my 97 Jeep 
Cherokee had no such problems and I 
will never purchase another GM product."

This car was so close to my dream car until the mechanical problems started. Replaced brake rotors twice, water pump, and now am experiencing problems with the fan and the annoying blinker switch noise (anyone who has one knows what I'm talking about), problems with starting the car due to a electrical problem all before 75,000. My extended warranty ends at 85,000, and I'm sure I'll make use of it. Not the most mechanically dependable car I ever owned. Very nickle and dime on the mechanics..."

windows replaced due to the glass 
getting scratched every time the 
windows were lowered and raised.  
Cruise control switch went bad.  Power 
window switches went bad.... three 
times.  Many minor electrical

replaced.  No problems with the power

I have all of the service records and the only problem I have, thus far, is the peeling of the door handles.  There was only one previous owner and the car is under an extended warranty.  When I initially purchased it, there were approximately 43,000 miles on it.  Not bad for a 2000 car of any sort.  I paid cash for it and it is definitely a nice ride for the money (I could never afford a brand new one).  I was also a previous Honda owner (Value Package sedan).  I like my choice.  It has a lot more features than the Honda or any other car I have owned.  I am going to stick it out!  I think GM should definitely stay keep the Alero. "

The head gaskets have had to be replaced and the brakes react terrible if it rains or snows. Needless to say this has not been anything like what I thought. None of the repairs have been anything close to cheap or acceptable. I would not recommend it to anyone, especially for young driver.

oldsmobile,alero,2001,Julian Perez, 07/12/2015,A definite NO!,2,"I bought this car at 160K miles and right after I bought it and drove it home, problems started to arise. The check engine light went on right as I drove it home, I didn't think much of it because everything seemed fine. A week later, I went to O'reilly's and got the codes pulled from the computer. Some sort of emissions trouble code and a piston spark plug fire miss code came up. Not a big deal at all, but just troubling since it started on my first drive in it. After that, the A/C compressor bearing went out and it made a loud pinging noise. Since the A/C compressor was such a pain in the butt to get to, I never bothered to get it fixed and just lived without A/C. Next, the stud on the trailing arm in the passenger's rear cracked off which rendered it useless. It wasn't too much of a pain to replace that, but a new trailing arm is quite expensive. After that, the power steering lines rusted through and I had to replace those which was VERY difficult and pretty pricey. Next, the alternator went out and I had to replace that which wasn't too difficult but pricey. Finally, the head gasket blew and it was EXTREMELY difficult to tear apart the engine and replace all the gaskets. Altogether, I got a discount on the materials required which cost around $180 but it took about 3 days to get it all fixed. Took it for a test drive after that and learned that I needed new spark plugs and spark plug wires. I took it around the block twice just to be sure everything was working properly. The next day, the car caught on fire and was totaled. A tiny bit of gas turned out to be leaking out of the return rail and the rusted spark plug wires arced to the motor and sparked the fire which soon became very large and melted a good portion of the wire harness. Overall, I took great care of the car. I frequently checked my fluids and got my oil changed every 3K miles. I definitely got a nightmare car though, note that I only had the car between 160K miles and 168K miles which was only for about 10 months. This is my bad experience with this car, take it or leave it.

The engine is very loud, and I have the 2.4L 4 cylinder engine and it's also very slow, it literally sounds and accelerates as if it had a big diesel engine in it. It averages 19 City, 25 Highway which is pretty bad for a car..especially considering it has a 4 cylinder engine...It's also not very comfortable..."

This is a good thing because it costs so much to keep it running! Wheel hubs, bearings, brakes, $$tires. I would tell anyone who asks not to buy an Alero, it is a complete lemon. I bought this car brand new, I have taken it to the Oldsmobile dealer for repair and no one can seem to fix my car. My dashboard lights are back on two weeks after it is ""fixed."" anti-lock, service vehicle soon, service engine soon, trac off always on!"
oldsmobile,alero,2001,alerolova, 06/15/2012,LOVE THIS CAR!!,4,"I was a little worried when i saw this car in my drive way after my parents searched for something after i was in a car crash. I read a lot of reviews and found nothing but horrible reviews nightmare stories and a lot of $$ signs. so after driving it for a while something happened, the hub bar. went bad...but since i work at a dealership...i got the parts for mad cheap thank god. i replaced the shocks and im telling you the car runs like new. amazing. so then i cleaned the engine valve and the injecters...and it starts every time, no clicking...no problems at all. i love the car i love how it handles and its fast. great on gas. so hey a lil investigating goes a long way...only 500 spent. :)"
oldsmobile,alero,2001,W. Tersch, 10/14/2008,A great all-around car,4,"I bought my Alero certified used five years ago, and it remains a beautiful and practical car inside and out.  Low mileage Oldsmobile are one of the best bargains out there and have served several friends well too. I replaced a power steering pump and a ventilation resistor under warranty, and a small screw cover fell off, but other than that, smooth sailing for daily driving and road trips after 70k miles.  This car handles Chicago winters well with its wide tires, front wheel drive, traction control, and ABS.  Still in love with it!"
oldsmobile,alero,2001,GoingStrong, 06/23/2010,Still a good car,4,"My father paid $10,000 for the 2001 Alero with 12,000 miles for my brother and I in 2002 when we were in high school.  I wasn't really crazy about it then because it seemed like EVERYONE had one but now I look back and see what a good car it was and still is. The only problem we have with it is the blinkers.  They ALWAYS CLICK! It takes them a couple minutes to stop clicking even after they switch off. The car is now my brothers and he hasn't had a single problem with it since the battery died last year leaving him stranded in the mountains haha.  Overall, great car for the money as long as it's taken care of. "
oldsmobile,alero,2001,Tony, 04/27/2008,Not Impressed,4,"If you happen to purchase this vehicle and their is a option to get an extended warranty I would highly recommend it. Very unhappy with the mechanical problems. At 58k I had to replace both front wheel bearings. Blower switch would only operate at high speeds. Replaced thermostat. The big one was at 78k the head gasket had to be replaced. Thirteen months later had to replace another front wheel bearing, ($500) out of my pocket because the warranty expired. The best investment in this vehcile was paying $35 dollars to transfer the original warranty to my name. Design of the interior isn't to bad except for cup holders in front. Gas mileage is good for a 3.4L, 26 city 31 hwy."

oldsmobile,alero,2001,Luke, 06/06/2008,No more GM cars!,3,"Bought this car used at about 60,000 miles and have put on another 60,000 driving to school/work. Driving and fuel efficiency aren't bad (although there's a big difference between winter and summer MPGs), but maintenance is a constant headache. I was actually vindicated to read on some of these other reviews about problems I've had: the leaky gasket issue, wheel bearings, starters, etc. Overall a sub-par vehicle which was obviously designed to last about 70-80 thousand miles and then be thrown away. Next car: something dependable like a Toyota or Honda - if my Alero is still worth anything at trade in when I can finally pay off the loan, that is."
oldsmobile,alero,2001,Kmarz555, 12/25/2008,Looks nice on the outside. Poison inside,3,"Where to start? Within the first year I owned it; the entire transmission went out. Luckily, the warranty covered that. However, the abs system on this thing is the worst I've ever seen. The ABS light always comes on, they want hundreds to fix it. The worse though is the knock sensor issues. I spent $2000 to fix it once, as soon as I got it back, it went out again. I took into the dealership for that one repair alone over 10 times! They still can't figure it out--the service manager claims its a manufacturing defect. The front CV joints sound like they're about to fall off--every time I turn I hear a loud rubbing noise (Those have been replaced too). Overall, I've suffered too long..."

I have lost track of all the repair work required to keep this vehicle running.  Some of the bigger issues were the windows, fuel pump, defroster, tire pressure indicator, and brakes.  I throw more money at this car than what it was worth.  The quality of craftsmanship was absolutely horrendous.  This car is a bust!  Anyone thinking of purchasing one should seriously reconsider."

oldsmobile,alero,2001,dom52, 11/07/2014,My experiance with this car.,3,"Well, i thought this car was pretty cool when i bought it. The interior was super clean, and drove great! Well, until my car would randomly shut off on the road. It happened at least 4 times, brought it to the dealer and they said they couldn't diagnose the problem. Turns out it was the ignition failure(GM recall, but this was over a year ago when this started happening). I then traded this car in, because i just couldn't trust it. Other than that it was a decent car."

the car down the road.  Lots of nice 
interior dials and controls.  Great 
Service from the dealership!  Sporty 
car."
oldsmobile,alero,2001,richinatlanta, 10/29/2003,Overall--I really like the 4 door GLS,4,"I did a lot of travel in 2000 and ended 
up renting the Alero several times. I 
really liked the layout of the interior 
and when I got a GLS version, the 6 
cylinder had plenty of power.

I was able to find exactly the model I 
wanted at a local dealer when GM was 
offering incentives, so I got a fully 
loaded 2001 silver model. 

The problems have been minimal in my 
opinion, and the build quality is ok 
for an American car, much better than I 
remember after owning several foreign 
models. Make sure to get the  
handling package option.

I would recommend the car based on my 
experiences."
oldsmobile,alero,2001,3and14, 11/09/2003,2001 Alero GLS 4 door,4,"Purchased an Alero GLS in Feb 2001 and 
have not regretted it in the nearly 3 
years since.  The handling and braking 
with the performance suspension is 
excellent, although the steering is a 
little quick at highway speeds.  The 
car has been very reliable with the 
exception of brake pads and rotors 
that wore out prematurely (22K), a 
common Olds problem.  For the money, 
this seemed to be the best choice at 
the time and nothing has made me 
question that decision.  Too bad Olds 
is going away as what's left in GMs 
lineup for the foreseeable future 
doesn't do it for me.  "
oldsmobile,alero,2001,GMCustomerNoMore, 11/05/2005,Typical GM Quality,3,"The one thing I can count on with the Alero is that I'll have to spend $600 every year to replace a wheel speed sensor. The brake rotors warp, it has hard starting, it needed a head gasket replacement, it has shaky side mirrors, it has a terrible front cup holder design, and now it has an intermittent power window problem with the driver's door.  These problems have all piled up to ensure that my next car will not be from GM.  At least my car is stylish (okay, for 2001 maybe), fun to drive, peppy, and has never left me stranded at the side of the road (knock on wood). I don't know why GM insists on using replacement wheel speed sensors with the same defect as the original, and why they can't make the 3.4L start like every other car -- only 2-3 seconds of cranking!"
oldsmobile,alero,2001,whitealleycat, 01/07/2006,You wonder why GM is in trouble!,3,"The 2001 Oldsmobile Alero is a piece of junk.  I had more problems than you can imagine with it, far too many to list.  The windows were scratched from the power windows, electrical problems, wheel bearing, brakes (x3), ABS sensors, you name it. This car was a money pit.  When I tried to sell it, it was worth nothing.  I basically gave it away and the poor kid who bought it, broke down after two hours of owning it.  What a nightmare. Avoid this car or any GM product.  They don't stand behind there name.  When your warranty runs out, your screwed. I'm looking at a Subaru now.  I swear I got 300 kms out of a tank of gas."

oldsmobile,alero,2001,AJB, 12/30/2004,Annoying Problems,4,"I have owned my Alero for a little over a year. The car is a solid drive, fast and fun, but I have been plagued by annoying problems. For example it's been in to the shop four times for the ""service engine soon"" light coming on. Turned out to be the O2 sensor each time, not particularly expensive but annoying just the same. Also the brakes are always noisy and seem to wear out quickly.Even with new rotors I still feel like it grates and grinds too much. The power windows have also caused a problem recently. Great looking car and real fun drive, but having previously owned a Japanese car, I think I'll head East again next time I buy. Make sure you like your dealer....you'll be back."
oldsmobile,alero,2001,jb, 03/10/2005,"Farewell Oldsmobile, sad to see you go..",3,"I was originally shopping for a more expensive car, however I purchased a new motorcycle the same summer and decided to be a bit frugal.  Even after looking at more expensive cars, the Alero stacked up well.  There were a few annoying items that were fixed under warranty (heater/ac fan control, driver window, some interior trim) but mechanically the car has been very reliable.  It goes through brakes quickly, but other than that I have had almost 85,000 trouble free miles.  The car exhibited very little body noise over rough pavement until the last ~10,000 miles.  Nonetheless, it is better than many other comparably priced cars (Camry, Accord) in this respect.  "
oldsmobile,alero,2001,David, 09/03/2005,A Good Car at a Reasonable Price,4,"I bought my Alero GLS new.  The included 5-year/60,000 mile total warranty offer is what convinced me to buy it over a Honda Accord or a Toyota Camry.  I have been totally pleased.  There are small annoyances:  too much road noise, the front cup holder, and a few too many (warranted) repairs.  But the car is a blast to drive, and I felt I got a lot of car for much less money than I would have paid for either of the other cars.  My greatest complaint is the long start / two-try start which the dealer says is normal.  It isn't, and it's embarrassing.  Overall a very good value over the 4 years I have now owned it.  If they were still made, I'd probably buy another in a year or so."
oldsmobile,alero,2001,Jeff, 05/01/2006,Ignore the naysayers,4,"I bought this car at 38,000 miles and put 53,000 miles on it. It has needed the kinds of repairs every car needs - a new thermostat, starter, and a power-window motor.  I also had to get new wheel bearings for the front wheels. The one bad thing is the rims. 3 of them are bent, but I do live in New York City. Everyone says they're pretty cheap though. Otherwise, it's a fun, zippy car to drive and the GLS model with a moonroof and spoiler is a good looking car."
oldsmobile,alero,2001,Den1, 09/07/2007,Beware-o Alero 2001 GLS Sedan,2,"I have had numerous problems with this car, the most expensive of which is the coolant system leaks due to poor design at GM. There's a class action lawsuit on this because it is such a consistent problem on these engines (3.4 Liter). If you have this engine, it will develop leaks. It can't possibly do otherwise since the coolant actually erodes the gasket material. It's simply a matter of time. Now with the wheel and brake problems and the numerous small issues, I have to say this would be a terrible choice as a used vehicle. If you like your money, stay away from it."
oldsmobile,alero,2001,Terry, 04/24/2008,Done with GM,4,"I bought my 2001 Alero brand new and have had too many service issues with this car.  Brakes, water leaks, windows, rear defroster, blinkers, security system.  I will never buy another GM product again.  This was my first brand new car and all the used cars I had previous to this one had better service records.  What bothers me the most about this car is that GM/Oldsmobile really did not step up to the plate on this car.  I even wrote to Oldsmobile headquarters - they only gave me some free oil changes! The only reason I keep this car is that it's paid for, but thinking of trading in before it gets too bad.  Shame on you GM and Walier's in Keene NH!!  "

my traction control (or whatever it's 
called) went out on me unexpectedly (it 
reset by itself later).  Manual

The second thing I noticed was that the car rode horribly. I got complaints from passengers all the time. The 3rd thing I found out is that my engine was burning 3 quarts of oil at 91K miles. The vehicle started every time I got in it without issue, but the car itself just wasn't great. It drove, rid and acted like a $1000 car.

oldsmobile,alero,2001,GMlover, 02/10/2002,Trouble,3,"Only 16,600 miles and in the shop 7 times.  3 times on the brakes, 4 times on a metal to metal grinding noise that the shop could never determine the problem even after replacing many parts.  Reconsider before you buy one!  We got rid of due to not feeling like the car was safe anymore."
oldsmobile,alero,2001,, 08/28/2002,Best Midsize Car,4,"     I purchased my Alero after heavy
consideration and comparison.  Over a
year later I am 100% sure I made the
right decision. The cars handling,
ergonomics and styling are excellent.  
This car has given me a newfound love of
driving.  Resale values are poor, but I
will not be selling it anytime soon. The
six-cylinder engine moves this car well,
with plenty of acceleration.  The seats
are comfortable and supportive. The
cloth seats are very nice but the
leather is cheap feeling.  To sum it up,
if my Alero were totaled in an accident
today, I would go out and buy another one."

quick with a few performance mods."
oldsmobile,alero,2001,Alero Owner, 10/11/2002,All About Alero,3,"This car is fun to drive. The only 
thing that has happened to it is the 
leather wrap around the hand brake 
needs to be re-stitched. There have 
been no mechanical problems at all. Not 
much leg room in the back, especially 
with for kids in car seats. They will 
probably get their legs broken if we 
get in an accident. Other complaint is 
the small gas tank. Only holds fourteen 
gallons. Most I can go without having 
to re-fill is a little over 300 miles 
per tank. Around town, only about 270 
miles per tank. Great car if you don't 
have kids."
oldsmobile,alero,2001,Flyboy, 10/07/2002,Where can I buy another one!!,5,"I purchased my Alero new in 2001.  It 
is used as a commuter for teenagers.  
We also own an Eclipse, but are looking 
for a second Alero and will sell the 
Eclipse.  The Alero is safe, handles 
well and provides the kids with the 
ability to take themselves and a couple 
friends to a movie and spares the back

offered at the time. Also, because I 
thought I needed a replacement for my 
S10 (which now has 166k on it). So I 
now have 2 vehicles. This car is 
actually a GL2 which has the sport 
suspension and Goodyear Eagle RSA 
tires. This particular model rides and 
handles very different from other 
Aleros. There were very few GL2s made."

for over 2 years now, and love it. Yes, 
I needed to change rotors during the 
first month (done under warranty, got 
brand new ones), but after that it has 
been excellent.  Car looks great, V6 is 
excellent, and with 16-inch alloy weels 
and wide tires, it has better moves 
than many other, more expensive 
vehicles.  I don't believe they are 
closing Oldsmobile."

the first car that caught my eye but 
once i took the price and standard 
features into consideration, looked 
like i was lured, and the bright red 
really stands out when clean.Looks 
really sharp from the front but the

gets great gas milege, i get around 
345 mpg highway. i've had no probelms 
with it execpt i did have to get new 
front brakes at about 40,000 miles and 
they still grind. the cars best 
features is the stereo and it also 
handles very well.  the back tail

could use a little more horse power. 
other than that i would recommend this

now.  I regret my purchase.

The Alero has nice styling, decently
performs, but is very poorly built. 
Rotors warp easily, the doors leak, the
A/C leaks into the dash, door panels
warp easily, the dashboard
creaks/squeaks, and now a recall for the
hazard flashers.  Body panel fit is
lousy, and the switchgear is cheap.  Do
yourself a favor and look elsewhere."

repairs about 5 times for different 
failures, incl. the rear speaker, oil 
leak at the intake (2 times), spark 
plug wire, warped brake rotors, and 
warning brake light stays on. I 
currently have 55K miles on this car 
and it came with a 60K ext. warranty 
and I have used the extended warr. 
several times. The 3.4L 6cyl. is 
underpowered compared to my 1995 Grand 
Am w/ the 3.1L 6cyl. If I had to do it 
again I would not buy this particular 
vehicle. "
oldsmobile,alero,2001,Sharrrona, 08/27/2003,GM Strikes (Out) Again!!,3,"I purchased my Alero with the highest 
of expectations. The car is very 
aestetically pleasing and is fun to 
drive. Unfortunately that is not enough 
to make up for the GM reliability. The 
sticker priceon my car was $22,000 and 
I paid $18,000 and thought I was 
getting a deal. 3 years and $6000 in 
repair bills later, I beg to differ.  
Please steer clear from this and other 
GM Products!!!  Great car if you have 
the occasional grand to put in it."
oldsmobile,alero,2001,eldo, 09/04/2003,Good Alero!,4,"This is a great small car. I traded a
compact SUV in on this and I do miss the
added room in the SUV compared to this
car. The room is adequate with the rear
seats folded down. It has very good
performance and seems tight and quiet.
The ride is solid and handling is great
with the 50 series, 16"" GoodYear Eagles
that came on it! I had two small
problems; the outside, drivers side
mirror and the inside rear view mirror
came off. Both problems were taken care
of on the spot and the dealer people
were very courteous. No complaint with
service! I feel this car is just as good
as imports from Japan in the same price
range! "
oldsmobile,alero,2001,jtskitty, 09/11/2003,Bad Brakes,3,"Overall I have pleased with the 
vehicle.  The main problem I have 
experienced has been the brakes.  We 
had to replace brakes & rotors at only 
30,000 miles and they still make a 
grinding noise with the new brakes.  
This is a definite manufacturing/design 
flaw on Oldsmobile's part.  Brakes are 
not something you should short change 
on a car.  This is a definite safety 
issue.  The second issue I have is that 
the service engine soon light came on & 
won't go off.  The third issue is a 
lagging starter.  Sometimes it works 
beautifully & then others I have to 
prime it to get it to start."
oldsmobile,alero,2001,mynameisalreadyinuse, 10/26/2003,Not too many problems...,4,"I haven't really had too many 
problems.  In fact, the only one's 
I've had were minor.  I did have one 
that upset me, though.  Both of my fog 
lights shattered and I needed to buy 
new ones.  Other than that, my car 
still looks new and runs great (for 
having 50k miles on it)!"
oldsmobile,alero,2001,Geografer, 11/15/2003,DO NOT BUY THIS CAR,2,"Had nothing but problems with this car 
since day 1. Back rotor brakes have 
been resurfaced 4 times (only 28K miles 
on car) and already need to be done 
again. There are random electrical 
problems (blinkers will randomly quit 
working while driving but turn the 
hazard lights on few seconds they will 
work again/radio will not turn off 
after car is off, keys out and doors 
open and will stay on constantly until 
suddenly going off as it should) that 
they can't seem to find an explanation 
for so can't fix. I bought this car 
because it claimed to be low 
maintenance but has been anything but. 
It has been in for repairs at least 6 
times a year."
oldsmobile,alero,2001,Astrodude, 11/19/2003,Whats wrong with the Brakes?????,3,"Let's face it. I've read all the 
reviews from others and there are 
serious brake problems with this car 
that must be manufacturing issues.  I 
have had warped rotors 3 times within 
70,000 miles and the first time was at 
only 19K.  I think a recall is in order 
for the brakes.  On a positive note, 
the interior of this car is awesome. 
I've never had a car with more 
comfortable seats.  I'm somewhat 
disappointed with the gas mileage too."
oldsmobile,alero,2001,tkt2ride, 06/15/2005,My last GM product,1,This car has been in the shop more than any vehicle I have ever owned.  All 4 electric window regulators (motors) replaced.

oldsmobile,alero,2001,MrLee, 10/31/2005,Piece of Junk,1,"Don't buy this car if your life depends on it. The computer system is garbage, mine has been repaired over four times and it is still broken. The security system is broken, and the car won't start. The windows leak, ruining the carpet (which won't be replaced) and after they are fixed, they fall off the track.  The rotors warped after only 12,000 miles and only third party replacements make it stop.  The intake manifold leaks coolant. "

oldsmobile,alero,2001,mattoxa, 07/20/2004,Absolutely Abhorrent,2,"We bought this car brand-new.  It has 
had multiple mechanical problems.  A 
design flaw that allows engine coolant 
to leak on the manifold has been the 
most expensive repair in a very long 
list of problems.  We recently were in 
an accident that resulted in a total 
loss of this car.  The air bags failed 
to deploy in a frontal collision 
raising concerns of safety.  The 
manifold problem was at 62,000, 
replaced ignition switch at 63,000, 
replaced bearing at 62,500.  Car 
totaled at 65,000.  These were the

I've replaced the front brakes a couple of times and I had to replace the fuel regulator at about 102,000 miles.  Aside from that and the recall on the soldering of the Hazard button I really cannot complain about this car.  I drive 40 miles each way to work and regularly drive 180 miles each way to my parents house on the weekends.  I get 27-28 miles per gallon on every tank of gas.

oldsmobile,alero,2001,Dave, 05/01/2006,Bucket of Bolts,2,"Whoever designed this car never drove it.  It has poor quality, features that were poorly designed, and poor fuel economy for a 4-cylinder, manual transmission car.  The engine has a fair amount of power, but the cockpit layout is not convenient.  There is a sensor in the stereo that increases volume with speed, but there are no pockets in the doors for maps.  It gets the exact same gas mileage that my '92 Grand Am with the 3.3L V6 and 3 speed auto transmission got.  The interior feels cheap and pasticy (a hallmark of GM cars over the last 20 years).  When the car was 40 months old (and the warranty expired) the emergency brake lever stopped working and the intermittent wipers went on the fritz."

Shortly after, the radio stopped working due to a wire being disconnected by the dealer (their fault). After that was repaired, because of the location of the wire in the driver side, it became disconnected again.

I drove 10 min away from where I was, turned the car off an hour later all of a sudden my car sounded rough. Didn’t want to stay running. I backed up put it in drive and it didn’t want to go. I had my gas petal to the floor. After I got down the road a ways it would feel like it would release and would go then it go back to the stage where I didn’t want to go. I stopped at a stop light and it died. I started it again and it died again on me. I had to keep pressing the gas petal and holding on to the break with my left foot til the light turned green it still didn’t want to go til after I guess 2 miles and it feel like it would released again and let it go. It’s like something is holding it back. I got home and put it in park and took my foot off the brake pedal and gas pedal. I listened to the car and it would try to die then the idle would go up. Then it would try to bog out again. As I was listening to it do this over and over, I watched the RPM gauge and it would floats way up then back down. I was reading other similar problems and how they had the fuel pump replaced and some saying having a security system problem but last year I had the almost identical problem with my 2001 Mazda. I changed the spark plugs and wires thinking it just needed a tune up but I still had the same problem during at a stop light in drive and when idling in park it would fluctuate on the rpm gauge. Bogging our and then idling real high then back down over and over. Turned out it was the fuel pressure regulator on my Mazda which was a recall from the manufacturer back in 2004 I found online. If anyone has the same problem. There’s a test you can do to find out if it’s bad or not and I’ll try to get back on how we did this to find out that it was in fact the fuel pressure regulator. I’m gonna try this on my alero and see if this is the same problem. Something for others to check out with the same problems or similar.

The Alero is a decent sized comfortable car with quite a few amenties for the money.
We paid $4800 for the 01 with 74k 1 owner, and $3700 for the 02 with 55k one owner as well

I should add the 02 has some hail damage and needed the lower intake gasket replaced.

Both have leather and a power driver seat.

Given a choice, the 3.4L V6 is the better engine even considering the gasket issue. I am getting 30 mpg highway"

Also car having a starting problem again.. 110th time.. have replaced battery, alternator, starter, and still wont start.  ALSO beware the ""pass-lock"" system.. shuts your entire car down for 10 min at a time and actually SHUTS YOUR vehicle down from stating for exactly 10 min,,. and you never know when it will happen..GM SHOULD HAVE RECALLED THIS ENTIRE LINE BACK IN 2002-2004 WHEN IT SETTLED IN COURT A CLASS ACTION SUIT BUT DID NOT ISSUE RECALLS ON ANYTHING EXCEPT THE IGNITION SWITCH!

The guy who sold me this POS knew what a Death Trap and it was when he sold it and got his eyes blackened and a broken nose in return after it landed me in the ditch over a mechanical issue that was recalled by GM!

First thing that went was the slave cylinder only we were told it was the master cylinder. So $1600 later it had a brand new slave cylinder, master, and clutch.  There was no problems till about 103,000kms one of the cylinders stopped firing, When the spark plugs were changed the car reacted badly, I guess only GM parts will make her run.

a 1997 Chevrolet Malibu for 2 years

have the GL1 with the 3.4 liter V6 
engine. It is sooooo responsive and 
compliant, it's amazing! The vehicle 
knows exactly when to downshift and the 
shifts are smooth and fluid. The 
traction control is okay on the 
vehicle, but not nessecary, even in 
slick weather. There are, however, a 
few TINY rattles and/or vibrations on 
the interior. They don't bother me too 
much, but I plan to get them fixed

thing I wish this car had was a 
spoiler."
oldsmobile,alero,2002,Ian, 09/01/2005,Good value for money,3,"Our Alero V6 is excellent value. We paid $10,700 when it was 15 months old and had 22,000 miles. It has lots of features, such as traction, ABS, CD player and I like the way the lights come on automatically too. My biggest gripes are the parking brake which has no adjustment for the cable,and which I personally feel should be used to protect the auto-box parking pawl, and the over-gearing, a typical GM trait. For a 3.4, it loses power dramtically at the slightest onset of a gradient. Lower gearing would make the performance more reachable and save me having to change down to maintain my momentum. However, you get what you pay for and the Alero is excellent value and has been pretty reliable. "

I love the look and the drive.  The gas mileage is about 20 mpg around town. It seems I stop twice a week for gas! The trunk space is huge! Has a great factory sound system. It is comfortable on long rides! The only problem has been with the CV joint (it still need to be replaced).  It causes an annoying knocking if I am on a bumpy road or turning. The interior quality is ok, except for the power source cover is made of weak plastic and has broken from use. It hangs off if opened. I need a bigger car for my larger family!  This car does not have much backseat legroom due to long legged drivers. When people tell me my lights are on I love to say ""That's Ok. They go off automatically!"""

I did not have problems with anything except for the brakes, I do all highway miles, and had to replace my breaks twice.  I would have kept my car longer if it wasn't for the breaks wearing down so fast.  The power windows often go out in these cars as well.  My friend's windows went out on his '99 Alero three times.  It has a very strong running engine.  It's quick and fun to drive.  It gets decent gas milage with a lot of passing power for a car in this price range.

I drive mostly highway miles, around 1000 km per week min. Love the drive, feel very safe and comfortable. Handling is excellent, low interior noise. A little disappointed with the low resale value. Overall a great reliable car I just wish they hadn't discontinued it."
oldsmobile,alero,2002,Samuelwise, 04/19/2019,Half decent commuter.,4,"This car has been passed down through the family from the dealer. By the time it was in my possession it had 80000 miles. And now stands at 280000. 
It has some querks for sure, but overall as been a reliable car. It has only failed me twice, bad fuel pump, and bad altenator. Which 13+ years down the road I'm not complaining.
Now for the querks, the speed sensors do not last long and require the entire hub to be replace. Otherwise a series of lights come up on the dash, and you loose traction control.
The interior, it's nice and comfortable. But some of the pieces just feel cheap, and did not age as well as the rest of the vehicle. 
The transmission. I haven't had to replace it. But there where several time I've considered it. Apparently over time the cooling grid looses tolerances causing fluid to not cool properly, and for the transmission to operate at a higher temoature then design, this as a driver means you'll experiance hardshifts, delays on take off, and a loud winning sounds in low gears. 
A external oil cooler solved all this and haven't had a symptem since. 
But the transmission is defiantly the weak point of this vehicle. And if a better design was chosen for this vehicle I'm sure it would be revered as a absolutely dependable car such as many of the Asian counterparts of the time. 
The good. 
I've kept up with general maintenance, but have dove very little in ways of major repair, just what's listed above and replacing some acceptably worn chassy parts. Fluid replacement, water pump, timing replaced when recommended by owners manual. 
Acceleration is excellent in this vehicle. 
And although there are some cheap parts the interior is very comfortable. 
It's good on gas. 
looks fairly sporty. 
It's has a nice ride, nothing exciting, and nothing luxurious. But some where in the middle. It feels like a boats when you take it easy, but proved to me on a few occasions that it will turn on a dime when you need it too. It's a smooth ride, with some unspoken potential behind it. 
And that ecotec engine isn't anything to write home about. But it's a solid engine. 
It's an old car. A old mobile. I will soon part with it. But I have to say, in the decade  I have spent with it. It has served me well. It has taken me many places. and I've never doubted it, to take me where I was going.

oldsmobile,alero,2002,Shiloh S., 07/19/2019,Oldsmobile Alero 5-stars,5,"True American muscle from Lansing, Michigan, the ironically named Oldsmobile Alero is anything but old. I owned my all-black, John Wick edition, 02 Oldsmobile Alero GLS for three glorious years. I had to sell this high-speed aphrodisiac once I desired a committed relationship. This car leads to nothing but street racing, infidelity, and a rockstar lifestyle. 0 to 60 in four seconds faster than the next leading car, you'll be tempted to challenge the police, and you should. The Alero was the original vehicle proposed to headline the Fast and Furious series but when Vin Diesel was too scared to sit behind the wheel of one, they moved on. The sheet metal over paper mache exterior is as aerodynamic as it is light. You can throw a barbell between two of these puppies and bust out a 10-set of incline bench. Consider investing in some top-tier windshield wipers because the stock model wipers won't be able to handle the number of moist panties being thrown towards your dash. The car's a classic all-terrain war machine. It only goes up in value. 5-stars.

I service this car myself and everything is done when called for. I buy the best of everything I do to it, wipers too.

I am a tall guy at 6'2"" and I can stretch  out when driving. It is fun, economical and rides great.even my headlight lenses  are not foggy as I've  always maintained them.My only wish is I'd  love to buy another brand new one someday but there no longer available. Stands to reason if you take really good care of anything it will last for many years to come.when you do need a part or even tires buy the best money can buy. You take care of your car...it will take care of you as well. My Alero has no rust anywhere, not even underneath as cause when I seen rust forming I took care or it right then .

Just some part that needed to be replaced, which included my fuel pump, but that was my fault, because I hated so much to stop and get gas, and my gas will always be on empty. And a harmonic balancer and something that has to do with the drivebelt. But that was just very recent. So, I have to say, my car has served me 'very well'. But, 3 of my windows don't work anymore.
But I can live with that. Those aren't the parts that matter anyway. Very satisfied with my car. Oh, love the stereo. "
oldsmobile,alero,2003,Johnny, 10/18/2015,Absolute Base Model Review,4,"2.2L EcoTec engine is decently powered for being in a bigger sedan. The instrument panels are very basic like just the bare essentials. Radio is different from the other models. its actually different from the one shown in the owners manual. The window clips that hold the window on a non-power window do become very fragile in advanced age. Only 2 major issues that have happened was transmission lines busting and brake lines busted all in spots which were difficult to repair by myself. There is one nagging issue but is very common and that is the security lock out upon start. The other slight issue is simply the road, between noise and comfort of ride. As the driver i have never had an issue with comfort in the front seat. My passengers tell me the front passenger seat is fine but the back feels like you are dragging the road. I would say this could be suspension. However, i replaced the whole nine yards of it, making it brand new parts. One major recommendation with an Alero (and any car for that matter), is to always do the regular maintenance because as it wears out, the way the car runs and rides becomes rough in this car. I know this due to the Condition of it when I purchased the vehicle in 2012.

My driver window didn't roll up or down, and my passenger window worked when it felt like it. Overall it wasn't bad for my first car, but it definitely had it's problems.

The car has less than 50,000 miles on it.  The gas mileage varies from 22 to 30 depending on oil changes, driving conditions...etc.  Its seats aren't really that comfy and the interior looks cheap.  You definitely pay for what you get.  I won't ever by another GM, next time it's a Honda or Toyota."

Replaced fuel pump, then it was needing repairs twice a year.
Joined a class action lawsuit and GM got out of it by filing bankruptcy.
If your buying an Alero plan on spending alot for repairs, due to cheap parts and a poorly running engine."

The pass lock locked my car first. 3 mechanics couldn't figure out what was wrong. All together $1000 fixed the problem. My Ford that I paid $1000 didn't give me as many problems as this! Brakes, bearings, spring coil, A/C, drum and the pass lock. All together well over $5000 put into it already! It makes me sick to my stomach. I will never again get an Oldsmobile! No wonder they shut down their production. The sound system is great but I would rather have a reliable car instead."

I absolutely love this car! It has about 111K on it, it has a few squeals in the front i think its just because I hit a pothole too hard and the ignition sticks a bit but nothing serious so far. I love that it has that sporty feel to it and it beats the hell out of my Mercury Tracer I had."
oldsmobile,alero,2003,Chris, 07/26/2008,"Great Car, so far.",4,"I purchased my car from a private dealer that buys wrecked vehicles at auctions and repairs them.  The fact that it had a salvage title made me a little weary but I couldn't complain for $4500 and only 32k miles.  The only problem I've had so far is the wheel bearings at around 45k miles, could be from wreck.  Although the motor is strong for a 4 banger it could use a little more power from the get go.  A little tip for the gas mileage, buy a k&n air filter and use Lucas fuel injector cleaner every oil change, I was getting about 28 mpg average and now 33 mpg average. I have had a problem with hydroplaning in heavy rain even with brand new tires maybe because the car sits so low to the ground"

Only complaint is the V6 is a gas hog but makes up for it in the handling and power dept. Too bad Olds closed down."

It has great power when you drive it but does not give very good gas mileage, about 28 mpg. After it hit 60K I started having problems with the Security System.  Basically, my car could start.  I was able to find out in the Manual that it has a Pass Lock Safety Lock.  So in order to start the car you have to leave it on for 10 minutes on the ON ignition key.  So far I've heard it may take $300 to fix the problem.  I also have a click, click sound on my signals that won't go away."

At 80k miles, gets decent gas mileage both in town and on the road, 20/30. It's a small car and rides like it. Had the security key module replaced three time and then finally the on board computer, which is quite costly when out of warranty. Replaced the front strut assemblies as they were worn out by 40k miles. I would look for a foreign make instead of this."

Still paying it off today, have had the front rotor replaced, brakes, tires, battery, fuel pump and windshield replaced. The only problem I keep on having is a small water leak into the fuse box from somewhere around the windshield area, had it replaced, was good for a year, then it started leaking after a 3 day rain. By this point I am tired of dealing with the cost of trying to find the problem and just want a car that doesn't leak. I love my Alero, but i need something that is a little less water loving. Great design, like the seat and stereo set up, even though car is compact and comfy."

I now have have about 63,250 miles on it and it has/had some problems. The passlock had to be replaced ($460), the suspension starts squeaking annually and I have to take it to the dealer to get it lubricated, and the CD player only takes CDs when it wants to. The 3.4L V6 is nothing to write home about either at 170HP. Based from what I've read, I've been lucky with this car. My dashboard hasn't started peeling and I haven't had to replace any pumps or bearings. Although functional, the interior seems cheesy. Also, this car can't handle in the snow. The rear end gives out even with good tires."

At that point, my opinion on this car changed greatly! It started having one problem after another, and had so many squeaks, rattles and air leakage that you would think it was a 20 year old car. This car was in the shop so often that everyone knew me on a first name basis! The final problem was a major computer meltdown at 68,000 miles. I left it at the shop (unrepaired), got what I could for trade, and bought a used Nissan Maxima! Do not waste your money and time on an Alero!"

I have replaced the brakes more often than I should have to, and have had numerous problems with the security system, that no one seems to be able to fix.  I will take it into the shop, and they will temporarily fix the problem, and it will stop again.  I have changed the spark plus, the ignition system, brakes, bearings, command start, and the clutch.  It drives nicely when it is working, but not worth the money that I have had to put into it.  All in all, I plan on buying a new car and ditching this lemon of an Olds.  Do not buy!"

very tight and crisp.  I'm not usually 
a fan of 4 cylinder engines, but the 
2.2 ecotec is super smooth, yet still 
torquey."
oldsmobile,alero,2003,holly, 08/08/2002,Good as a Honda for thousands less,4,"I purchased my Alero after three years 
of debating between it and a Honda 
Accord. Though I have to admit the 
Honda seems more refined, it wasn't 
$5000 more refined than the Alero. I 
enjoy driving this car because of the 
big 16 inch wheels, the torquey V6, and 
the excellent 8 speaker sound system. 
Once I heard about the free 5 year 
warranty, it just didn't seem worth 
pursuing the Accord anymore. The only 
thing I would like changed about the 
Alero is the transmission's 
aggressiveness. At highway speeds, a 
downshift requires a substantial stab 
of the gas pedal. 
Overall, I love this car and plan to 
keep it for 200k miles."

At 55K had to replace the fuel pump and some additional parts associated with the fuel system.  At 74k had to repair and replace many parts of the air conditioning system.

minimum problems only having problems 
with the backseat door paneling pealing 
due to the extreme Arizona heat. If I'm

oldsmobile,alero,2003,TheDarxion, 06/21/2004,Alero Good With Exceptions,3,"I like the Alero for all aspects 
except two: 
1) Front brakes and wheels.  My Alero 
has had two brake jobs and a replaced 
hub assembly (wheel bearing) in 30,000 
miles....and GM only warranties the 
break pads (at $70) for 1 year / 
12,000 miles.
2) Poor city, rural (not highway), and 
winter MPG...22 MPG winter, 26 MPG 
summer on country roads (22 miles home 
to work), 33 MPG hiway.  Not sure what 
gives here.

So, if you are willing to put up with 
continued brake and wheel work (as I 
discovered has happened to many 
others) and lower MPG (except on the 
highway), this car is good....but 
don't buy it new...poor resale value."

oldsmobile,alero,2003,mjr, 04/15/2006,Pretty good at first.....,3,"I bought my Alero with about 24,000 miles on it.  In about a month I had to return to the dealership for four new window assemblies and window. This was an obvious design flaw, but they claimed it was a fluke (4 all at once...).  Also, the front wheel bearing went, blower motor, and a few other things.  I bought a 75,000 mile warranty for it, and of course, with 75,252 miles the other front bearing goes bad.  I take it back to the dealership for the noise.  They come out and tell me that it's the bearing, alternater, lower intake manifold gasket, both lower control arms, both upper strut mounts.  I was given a rediculous quote to fix it all.  I'm not sure what to do, but I would recommend avoiding picking one of these up."

oldsmobile,alero,2003,Jerry Elliott, 02/10/2007,Fun to Drive in Good Weather,4,"I've owned this vehicle for 3 years and had no maintenance problems except the usual tires, brakes, and battery changes. The front suspension was a bit squeaky the first year or two but seems to have settled down. The biggest drawback has been this car's performance in the snow. Though it is FWD, the Enhanced Traction System (which can be turned off with the push of a button) actually makes it more difficult to control the slippage and power of the vehicle. Overall, the vehicle is a little noisy, but fun to drive, even on long road trips."

oldsmobile,alero,2003,JAMMINJED, 04/03/2007,2003 Olds Alero,4,It's been a great vehicle. It has a sporty feel to it even with the 4 cyl engine. I can get from 0-60 in about 7 seconds easy. It's not bad for only 140hp and a heavier car than most with this size of engine. I love the sharp turns and handling.

style interior quality.  fake and 
chinsy looking"
oldsmobile,alero,2003,R W, 07/09/2007,Suprised it's not a Honda!,4,"Bought it with 20,000 miles. I owned 3 Honda's before this one and I didn't enjoy the reliability. I've only replaced an alternator (93,000 miles) and a fuel pump (91,000 due to a very bad tank of gas). That's it outside of regular oil changes, brakes, and tires. This is the best money I've ever spent on any car. It still runs like it is brand new. For a 4 cyliner it is quite peppy, more than the Honda Civic that was $2K more than the Alero at that time  Now, it's 2007 and I can't find Alero's anymore? That's OK. Mine runs fine. I'll keep driving it. GM should re-open the Olds Alero line. This is the best 4-cylinder car for the money GM has made!  "

beutifully and really hugs the road.  
The interior is comfy and quiet.  Very 
smooth ride.  I was in a fairly bad 
front end accident (+/- 30-35 mph) two 
years ago.  I was very pleased with the 
safety performance of the car.  Even 
after the accident, I've (surprisingly) 
had absolutely no problems with it. My 
lease is up in 6 months and I am torn 
between getting another one or not

oldsmobile,alero,2003,Chelle, 04/10/2008,"Great car for the price, few problems",4,"I got this vehicle after totaling my Dodge Dakota. I am definitely more pleased with it than I was the truck. I read after we had the car for about a year that there were many complaints about it, especially the dash and inside door material peeling up. I have put quite a few miles, a lot of them aggressive-driving miles, and have only had the air go out (turned out that a cap was missing-less than a couple dollars to fix) and the ignition was not recognizing my key, so the car shut down. That cost me about 300. Also, sometimes blinkers quit working, then suddenly come back on. But so far, so good with anything Major. "

It was a good 1st car to me but I need something more reliable.

 Only problems I have had was the fuel pump and the alternator went out. Oh and the pass key thing had problems but there is a easy fix for that if you Google it and it consists
of a inexpensive diode being soldered into the wiring.
 Would I recommend this car even with the high miles mine has.... You bet I would. "
oldsmobile,alero,2004,TERRIFIC, 11/15/2009,An excellent automobile,4,"I love my Alero. It has the 4 cylinder redesigned engine and I could not want more. The ride is very comfortable and the highway driving is exceptional. It hugs the road and ""drives itself."" I've never had a better steering car. GM got it right with steering ratio, turning effort, return, etc. its the best. Low noise level at highway speed is exceptional. NO wind noise. All around a great car. Also,factory speakers sound great, no need to upgrade. "

oldsmobile,alero,2004,galaxybeing, 04/08/2008,Best Olds ever,4,"This is the 2nd Alero owned by my wife and me. She has been driving her 99 Alero since 2000. A super car. She has 110,000 miles on it now and it is still a great looker and a terrific little speeder - especially with the K&N air filter, which make sit roar. Both aleros, I drive the 04 have the 3.4 engine, which I highly recommend to anyone considering buying an Alero. Great styling, too, for the price range. Keep Mobil 1 in the crankcase and the engine will always show the driver its appreciation. So far, the 99 Alero needed an alternator and a front strut replaced. As well, the hazard switch broke but will be repaired free under a recall order. The 99 is super fast - much faster than the 04,"
oldsmobile,alero,2004,oklahoma man, 11/26/2008,The performance is horrible!,3,"This is a nice car. However, the performance stinks! It takes forever for the the throttle response to kick in. It's like they took this heavy car and put a go cart engine in it! It's loud but not powerful at all! Barley gets up to speed on the highway. I tried to go around a Sunfire and couldnt even do it! But every time I turn the key I know it will start. Oh and the handling is terrible too. And they dont make any performance or upgrades for this car! Nothing!"
oldsmobile,alero,2004,Foxy, 06/22/2008,Inexpensive and Pleasing,4,"The standard 2.2 L engine in the Alero has a bit of torque and is peppy and fun to drive.  The Alero coupe's appearance is classy, yet sporty enough to be an attractive car.  I've owned my Alero for three years, and while it's not an envy-worthy car, I get great gas mileage, and it's been VERY inexpensive to maintain.   I have had ZERO major problems with my car.  I've only had to repair the lifter on the automatic window.  Probably my fault it broke.  I paid $10K for my car when it was a year old, and my payments are very low. I'd recommend the Alero for anyone (like me) who's fresh out of college, has a limited budget, and needs NICE, affordable transportation."

oldsmobile,alero,2004,Noah Private, 10/20/2016,Olds alero driver,3,"This car is really great! Don't get me wrong though there are some problems.... I have an 04 red 2 door 3.4l and boy this thing is pretty quick. You put your foot done and it drops down a gear and just takes off. It feels like you are ""floating"" when you drive or get up towards the governed speed of 110 mph. I passed a lot of cars with this alero, including some mustangs and many many hondas. This car has some major head gaskets issues however. I am on my 3rd set now. I have rebuilt this motor myself inside and out. Stock rods and pistons are pretty solid, and the aluminum heads dissipate a lot of heat. This car also has bad tranny problems.. This is my second trans in my alero, they leak tranns fluid really bad. However the engine area is pretty easy to work on, you can pull the whole motor apart in the engine bay and put it back together in 8 hours. Also this car seems to have a problem with staying aligned and it blows through brake rotors, calipers, and brake pads. Even with a good alignment this car goes through tires quick. I am a little rough on the car because I deliver pizza everyday. It is pretty fast though, more lower end power. Stock speakers sound nice, driver seat raises and lowers.

The wiring harness behind the steering wheel was replaced once and needs to be replaced again.  This car is a magnet for old people to hit.  Now my car wont start.

Who ever had it before me did not do any preventative care to the car, I had to put a lot of work into it but it was worth it, I have asked all of my friends to keep an eye out for any GLS coupes in the Tri-cities area, and we still have not found one.

GREAT !! The handling is quick and

other thing I would change, and that is 
the headroom. I am a little tall

I favor the Alero because it's not a dorky car, and it's not a boring Honda/Toyota.  Its exterior design has a lot of personality and class.  I get a lot of looks of approval in my little gal, and she's as stock as the day I bought her!  So far, I have had ZERO problems with this car.  She is very reliable and so much fun to drive.  The Alero is quite possibly the most underrated car of the decade.  Needless to say, I've gotten my money's worth, and a whole lot more."

Taller people had a hard time with the leg room and the head room. There was some clinking noise behind the radio, they couldn't figure out. The driver's door window seal  wasn't tight, and would sometimes leak  water when it rained.  In the winter time I had the most problems.The driver's door wouldn't latch tight when  I shut it every time. I would have to spray W-D 40 on it for it to shut properly. The worst part was the brakes. If I hit snow or ice, especially going downhill, there was no stopping the car. The brakes sounded as if they were grinding, bad. All in all, it was a smooth ride."

individual.  We had never been big fans
of the Oldsmobile line, thinking this
was an ""old"" person's car.  However, we
test drove this car and were blown away.
 The Alero drives very well, with clean
reaction to steering and is very
comfortable to boot. It's a  nice size
for the family and yet is very sporty. 
We couldn't beat the price either,
bought it for under 5,000.00 (2000
model, w/47,000 miles and light hail
damage)  and still are happy after
almost a year.
The only complaint is that there is alot
of road noise.  "

The ride of the vehicle could be better but the handling is fantastic! Acceleration is really good probably because I have the 3.4, sorry for you 4 cyl out there lol. The safety of this car is amazing for such a little car, took a lifted Dodge Ram head on I really thought this car was going to the junkyard but nope I slapped a new hood bumper and fender on and it drove like new! This car does go through brakes pads and rotors pretty often ( replaced 3 times already mileage is only at 145,000) and when they were replaced it still squeaked when drove (annoyed the hell outta me but hey the car still stopped) also the car goes through tires quickly too ( also my 3rd set 30,000 miles) you really need to keep up with the maintenance on this vehicle and she should last you a very long time!

oldsmobile,aurora,2001,Michael C, 04/01/2016,Worth a lot more than you will pay!,5,"I was an auto broker for many years and I recommended this car to numerous people. Is there a car made that doesn't have problems, of course not, there will never be a ""one and done"" but if you are looking at one of these get it checked out by a mechanic first and then be glad you bought it. The gas mileage for a car of this size is wonderful, the ride is really good. It's roomy front and back and has a massive trunk. The trunk is so big I put a 12"" sub woofer in a box and mounted it in the trunk and I can still get the spare tire out. When you are driving it doesn't feel as big as it is. I have a 2001 with 108,000 miles and it doesn't even let in much road noise at all. I do a ton of driving and the only thing I have done to the car in a year and a half is add an after market stereo. I honestly don't have anything negative to say. To get really nit-picky I'm 5'11"" tall and the seats don't go back as far as i would like. If you are my height or taller you definitely want to check that out first.  I guess you get what you pay for and in my case I got so much more because I paid hardly anything for mine. Even though Oldsmobile isn't being made anymore quite a few different GM products used the same parts. This being said, parts are not hard to find and this isn't a high maintenance car to keep up. 

*Update
I've been commuting now for the past nine months and I'm averaging over 400 miles per tank of gas. The air shocks are great for long drives and this car takes a beating. I have put 27,000 miles on it in the past 9 months and its running strong.

I've had little issues like changing a handful of sensors, and a fuel pump but spending a few hundred every once in a while is better than a car payment. It is pretty good on gas for being a V8 too, I live in the city and my average is 23 mpg. On the express way I get around 35 believe it or not! My Olds still has plenty of life left in it. I plan on keeping it until I run it into the ground and who knows I might look for another after."

So far it has been pretty dependable, and the aluminum hood and trunk lid are pretty trick.  I enjoy the heated seats, the great radio/cd player with the 12 disk changer in the trunk, the climate control, steering wheel controls, and beautiful interior and exterior.  It has a sunroof, and intelligent wipers, and the aluminum 4 cam engine and trans are quiet and smooth.  I do my own repairs-this car is a little complicated, but so far I have been able to solve the somewhat minor problems without any drama.  Nicer than a Caddy, Jag, Acura, BMW in my opinion."

I have had no problems with it other than normal maintenance."
oldsmobile,aurora,2001,Karen Troxell, 07/16/2016,There ain't nah-thing ordinary about this car.,5,"Perhaps I should say that everything about this car is ordinary. That is if you're comparing it to a BRAND NEW Japanese Luxury Sport Sedan! It seems like every new Maxima, Accura, Camry, Infinity, and even BMW is trying to BE this car!  This does have the negative effect of driving a classic while looking like everything else out there. That's how far ahead of it's time it was. It's BIG. Not as wide as most full-size luxury sedans, but that's actually an advantage. It has a big car ride, but doesn't give a big car driving experience. You know... boring. With it's speed-sensitive steering, it feels more like a Firebird on the open road. You know... exciting! It's a real solid build. Simply stated, check out Wikipedia, who says that it broke GM's frame-crush tester. Then go online and look at some pix.  See how much rust, and how many dents you see on these classics. And with that solid build, you're nearly guaranteed a quiet interior. Let's talk about that quiet interior. The first time I got into mine, if I had gone in blindfolded, when it was removed, I would have thought I was in a European exotic. Most comfortable driver's seat I've ever parked my butt in. High-backed leather bucket. Look at the pix again. See how many cracked seats, dashboards, and door panels you see. Mine doesn't have any. The instrumentation has an understated elegance. The cockpit is completely driver oriented, with a split dashboard that cries out, ""Hands off my controls!"" As a matter of fact, the ashtray is actually quite inconvenient for the front passenger, who actually needs to do a 'reach-around'. CONSIDERING it's size, the gas mileage is GREAT! Out on the highway at 65, I get THIRTY-TWO miles to a gallon. A/C or not.  With the unspeakably comfortable climate control off, I get around 23 in ordinary conditions. And, (groan) about 15 if I do run the EIGHT speed blower fan. But it is absolutely the best A/C I've ever seen in a car. Those are deadly accurate readings. It has a Driver Information Center that tells you virtually EVERY stat you would want to know about fuel. You know... just like a new car. But it does have it's limits! Once it reads that you have a fuel range of 45 miles, it says 'low fuel', and it won't let you reset it. It's like it's saying, ""Look, a-hole, I said you're REAL low! You ain't holding me to a critical prediction!"" All this, while cranking 215 hp out of a 3.5 V6. Now the bad. I'm a member of the Aurora Club of North America, which is a good thing, for a BAD reason. Some mechanics refuse to work on these. There are no Chilton's or Haynes manual available. There are very few in the junk yards, some small parts are non-existent, (in my case, window retaining clips), and they don't generally match up with other GM cars. You-Tube videos showing guys doing repairs on them are non-existent as well. The trunk tends to leak, and the window switches are not switches at all, they are 'triggers', and every time you touch one, you're playing Russian Roulette. You WILL spend some time messing with windows. My driver's window goes about 3/4 of the way down IF you help guide it both up and down. It operates on zip-ties, despite the fact that we did everything we could to get a better fix. I've owned 20 cars in my life, and I've only truly loved three of them. This one, is my all-time favorite. Let's wrap it all up like this. If you asked me to trade my Aurora, for ANY other car, and I couldn't sell it, I could only drive it.... I'd tell you to shove your Jaguar!

Well, they asked me to update my review. A 1995 Chevy Suburban plowed into my rear at 40 MPH, with their foot on the gas instead of the brake, while I was stopped at a stop sign. It pushed the trunk in, and destroyed the bumper cowling and fog-lights. Not a BIT of damage to the frame or quarter panels. It didn't even move the car, or give me a jolt.  The only reason I knew I had
 been tagged was because I heard the crash. This is important, because a smaller car would have been pushed into the intersection, where it would have been T-boned by the right of way traffic.  Drove it like that for 10 months with a bungee holding down the trunk lid. So their insurance gave me double what I paid for it, 1/1/2 months after I bought it. Bought a $400 parts car, paid $750 to a frame shop to pull the trunk, and switched out the doors, because all the windows in my parts car were working. I guess I should add that I drove that parts car 175 miles back home, with a slipping transmission that wouldn't hold any fluid. Even that was a more enjoyable ride than most cars. 

I have now owned the car for 14 months, and have kicked out for a crank sensor, and a brake line. Had to drop the starter to change the sensor, but was still a relatively cheap and easy repair. When the  sensor went, it didn't leave me sitting. The 'check engine' light came on, and I had to pump the gas to get it going. For a 15 year old car with over 100K, that is GREAT reliability and value.

The car has needed $1500 in transmission work, $300 to fix a steering shaft, has suffered a leaking trunk and leaking sun roof, has various electrical gremlins, and has been an overall disappointment. Of the last 6 oil changes, only one visit was just for an oil change, in fact I've spent over $4000 in repairs in two years. Its no wonder why GM went bankrupt after owning this car."
oldsmobile,aurora,2001,Robin, 07/05/2010,Was good in the beginning,3,"I bought the Aurora with 40,000 miles on it. It was great nice smooth ride handled well and loved the set up inside. About 3 years ago I started having problems with the wheel barons and have replaced the front driver and passenger side about three times each. All the Windows don't work the motors inside all broke the sun roof leaks. The transmission leaks, the oil leaks I have to put almost 5 qt in between each oil change and I had to replace the alternator twice in one year along with many other things. I just put a brand new alternator in a month ago and had to buy a battery yesterday and my battery light is on and says check charging system and I don't know why. I regret buying this car "
oldsmobile,aurora,2001,niteowl, 04/02/2004,Great Car Overall,4,"Overall this has been a good ownership 
experience.   The car rides great, is 
quiet, and the V6 gives a good 
compromise between mileage and power.  
I drove the V8, and while it has more 
power the front end was heavier and 
the car seemed less agile.  Excellent 
highway cruiser.  After a long trip we 
are much less tired than riding in 
other cars we have owned.  Have seen 
others complain about 
squeaks/rattles/fit/finish, howevever, 
I have had no problems.  No warranty 
issues other than replaced front tie 
rods at 35,000 miles--seems to be an 
issue with this car and the Seville, 
which share the same platform.  "
oldsmobile,aurora,2001,Glenn, 10/20/2006,2001 Olds Aurora,4,"My car is fun to drive - it handles securely in traffic and on the road.  After 70,000 miles it has been very reliable with only two trips to the dealer for repair service.  It is a good sized car that is very comfortable and economic to drive.  My car gets over 30 mpg on the road and usually 26 - 27 mpg overall.  I have never been stuck in the snow here in Wisconsin.  The V6 engine seems to have adaquate power in passing other cars on the open road.  The trunk space could be a little larger, but that is a small matter overall.  If GM were were still making this model it would be first on my list when looking for another sedan. "
oldsmobile,aurora,2001,Frank, 11/23/2006,"Hate to Trade It, but...",4,"We bought this car as an early lease return and paid half of what a new one cost. It has had the typical repairs (dimming headlight problem and ignition switch failure) but overall it has been reliable and a head turner whenever we take it out. It has never seen snow or winter roads (a garage queen) but the resale value is plummeting, parts seem to be in short supply, and my extended warranty is up, so it will be traded in shortly for a fraction of what should be worth.  I, too, am sorry GM bailed out on this one. It was my third Olds and by far the best. I tried a Cadillac CTS but it just doesn't come close. Looks like an Acura may be the next step."
oldsmobile,aurora,2001,Airfiddler, 12/09/2006,A Lot of Car for the Money,4,"I was looking around for an econobox when I saw this car. It was in beautiful condition, well looked after. One test drive and I was sold. Hey great gas mileage isn't everything. The engine and transmission are soooo smooth. It has lots of power, and it has a great snarl when you put your foot into it. The ride is a little firmer and noisier than my Buick Riviera's. It could be the low profile 17"" wheels and tires. Its build quality is adequate. It's no Lexus, but for what you will pay it can't be beat. A few little things may bug you, like burnt out dash lights or the odd squeak now and then. That 4.0 litre Northstar DOHC engine is worth the price of entry alone. It's so quiet and vibration free compared to the Riviera's 3800 V6."

oldsmobile,aurora,2001,srcorvettez06, 04/07/2008,Fun and reliable,4,"The harder I beat on this car the more it asks for. I have a cool air intake and I painted the brakes and mufflers with rustoleum. I'm 17 and really beat on my car. It's faster than it looks. After port and polishing the intake, I was able to keep up with a Camaro RS with a 305ci. The 3.5 has a lot of potential. Removing the Cat and Res boosted 12 Horses at the front wheels.  Intake was about another 5 with port and polish adding 8.  My only recommendation to everyday drivers is getting a set of Goodyear Assurance Luxurys. I ride on Goodyear Eagle F1 GS-D3. They can take the Aurora around corners at about 3X the speed limit. Really expensive but they last forever."

The car is everything Michael said in his review and more. I call it my American BMW and the rear is independent suspension NOT a solid axle. The V6 is not a powerful Dodge Pentastar but the ride and bang for the buck is incredible.
I have seen another review and the fellow has some 260,000 miles and still loves it.
Like anything, dont beat it, their older now. I am going to try and avoid high RPM passing gear down shifts until I can have the transmission serviced. The engine lists more torque than horsepower so you dont really need to go over 4200 RPM.
I already have people cant believe the condition and good looks. So find a nice one and enjoy it.

Water pump, ($350) Power steering pump, ($200) Front-end wheel bearings, Tie rods, Front-end alignment, (650), A/C Compressor, (900). My car had an leaking oil issue to the point of going through 4 quarts in between oil changes. Interior quality wasn't very good - headliner falling down - door panel plastic crumbling.

These cars were around $40K new and 7 years old and could barely get $4500 with 96,000 miles on it - although I'd probably would have gave it away as much as I hated it.
The 4.0 v8 always leaked oil - the oil pan gasket at $1500 a pop to replace; replaced water pump twice, struts were going, power steering leaked, sunroof broke and countless other problems.
The only good thing I'd say is that it was comfortable and some what stylish design.
Unless you get this car for free, I'd stay far way from this car, it will suck every penny out of you.

Great gas mileage for a luxury car (28 on highway). Trouble free. One small air pump valve failed, simple replacement done myself with genuine GM parts from on-line supplier.

I wish I could say the same for the SUV I replaced it with. I have put 17,000 on my 4.0 L since February and it is still going strong. There have been minor issues but all have been simple to take care of without the need for a dealer or auto shop to be involved.

enjoy the quiet ride, comfort and 
relative performance of the Aurora. Not 
much can beat performance of Vette, but 
Aurora does me just fine, especially on 
the highway.  For the money, you can 
get no better car.  Am really unhappy 
they discontinued Olds. Have looked at 
Cadillac CTS and BMW 330 and decided to 
stick with the Aurora. "

and I've owned quite a few of them.  
Traded in a '98 Taurus for this car and 
am I glad I did.  The gas mileage for a 
big car is excellent, much better than 
the Taurus, 29+.  "
oldsmobile,aurora,2001,robbin, 09/19/2004,Love It,5,"This is an awesome car! I spend two 
hours a day in my Aurora. I am so 
pleased with comfort, style, and 
performance. This was a perfect used 
car purchase with a huge depreciation 
from the brand new purchase price. I am 
sorry for all of you bought new. Too 
bad Olds decided to end, I would want 
to buy this car again. All the reviews 
here helped me decide on this purchase. 
The white with chrome wheels and tinted 
windows are a perfect choice for a 
chick car. This is definitely not my 
grandfathers car. It tickles me when I 
see another Aurora with older folks at 
the wheel. Seeing another Aurora is a 
rare site. Great to be different!"
oldsmobile,aurora,2001,Darrell Tope, 06/07/2005,"Sharp looking, satisfying",4,"I enjoy the look, comfort , performance and reliability of my Aurora. Combined city-highway driving average is about 23 mpg at speed limits. Handles moderate bumps a little stiff (like all three of the Oldsmobiles I have owned). I was expecting a little sportier ride (handling in the curves), but overall I am very satisfied with my Aurora. I wished GM had not discontinued them."
oldsmobile,aurora,2001,NESZ, 06/08/2005,Goodbye to the pre-pro,3,"I own an Aurora this has been the most fun I have had in an automobile, to have the luxury, driveability, quality, and body style all rolled into one vechile. The performance of the powertrain is top shelf."
oldsmobile,aurora,2001,Jerry Barrax Jr, 07/03/2005,Aurora 3.5,4,"I just purchased a 2001 Aurora 3.5. It's a gorgeous full-size sedan that has the styling of a mid-size car. It's a fully loaded luxury-sport sedan in silver metallic. The previous owner had the windows tinted, so it looks even sportier. I get compliments on it constantly. It's very well equipped, comfortable for long trips, and very satisfying. Being a front-driver tuned for comfort, it's not a ""canyon carver"", but has good acceleration and decent handling. "
oldsmobile,aurora,2001,TSprinkel, 08/08/2005,Best car I've ever owned,5,"Why did Olds go away?!  I've had many new cars, but this is definitely the best overall value.  It's fun to drive, still looks good, and I'd keep it forever, but putting too many miles on it.  It's a terrific vehicle."

oldsmobile,aurora,2001,jjse, 09/28/2006,Constant Companion,4,"This car is eautiful and very reliable.  The only repairs that I have had to make so far are a battery and wiper blade replacement last week.  I will probably buy new tires in November.  The engine loves to rev but is relatively low on torque.  Its ride is a little harsh, but its handling is above average.  New tires will probably improve the ride.  My only complaint is a rattling sunroof when the shade is partially open.  I would probably buy another one if a 5- or 6-speed auto was offered."
oldsmobile,aurora,2001,carruol, 03/25/2003,Best Olds yet,4,"I can't wait to drive the car it is just
that much of a great
performer,smooth,nimble
handling,powerful ly silky smooth v8 and
just about every   thing that makes a
great car, is standard  . AND it
compares well with the cars from Japan.
GM would do well to offer this car in
one of their existing lines."
oldsmobile,aurora,2001,baitshop, 02/05/2012,Good car but has had some issues,4,"I bought this car at 30,000 miles and have put 100,000 more on myself.
There were some issues with the steering about two years after I bought it, Olds. recalled the Alero for steering issues but not the Aurora however they have the same steering set up.
The steering wheel mounted controls do not light up as they should.
In the last two months I have started leaking oil and now I am looking to get rid of it all together.

On the plus side, it has really good pick up, lots of extras, lots of power and it does well in all weather.
Very safe too.

It has been a good car for 140,000 miles but it is going to take some serious cash in the next year to keep it running."
oldsmobile,aurora,2001,DBurden, 03/22/2007,Best K/G body ever,4,This car is highly underated.  The Aurora has great grip and handling for a 3800 lb auto.  The auto leveling suspension in rear takes the roll out of corning.  High speed cornering is no problem.  The more you dial in the tighter the grip get.  Steering is better than expect.  I plan on taking this car to summit point raceway to further evaluate its ability.    
oldsmobile,aurora,2001,Doc John, 04/25/2003,Nice sedan overall,4,"In my opinion the best American-made
sedan for the money. Comfortable and fun

that work well."
oldsmobile,aurora,2001,Mike, 07/05/2007,Good value,4,"Normally I don't like to buy American cars, but after doing my research I decided to take a chance on the Aurora. I am very pleased overall with the car.The acceleration is brisk but it could use a little more low end power.I bought a K&N drop in air filter and helps with throttle responce. The interior is well laid out and conrols are easy to use. The exterior is awesome. I have back problems and long trips are a difficult, but in this car, I'm really comfortable.I've had no mechanical problems at all.considering what I paid for the car and all the features it has, it's a good value. I would suggest that if you purchase an Aurora, or any American car, get an extended warranty."

features it provides. Many standard 
features make it very easy and fun to 
drive. The 4.0 has lots of power. 
Handling leans more towards comfort 
than performance but there is a good 
balance. Mechanically sound but has 
been in the shop more than expected for 
minor cosmetic stuff. "

It's a beautiful car that turns heads

this is the last Oldsmobile I will be 
able to own.  "
oldsmobile,aurora,2001,Gary Findon, 06/21/2003,2001 Aurora,3,"While the Aurora exudes understated 
class and has a very attractive

It's very comfortable to drive, especially on 3 day road trips. I get 33mpg (highway driving). Amazing what high octane fuel and K&N air filters can do for mileage and passing power! It's very safe/stable driving on highways or in the city in all whether conditions be it be rain, ice or blizzard. I can't even tell the roads are bad it handles so well! Here in Canada we have extreme road conditions and I have no problem passing other cars/trucks (good or poor road conditions). There has been no work done to the car except regular maintenance. No breakdowns or problems. Car has 77,400 miles on it so far."
oldsmobile,aurora,2002,Mac Aipperspach, 08/28/2009,Fun to drive,5,"An excellent car to drive and with the interior extras very comfortable for long distance trips.  The vehicle was purchased used with 43,000 miles and after 10,000 miles the only trouble so far will be to replace the original rear shocks which are rather pricey due to computer linkage.  Plenty of power and for a V-8 on the open highway I can get 25 miles to the gallon."
oldsmobile,aurora,2002,sdagostin, 04/17/2002,A steal,4,"The Aurora has a better, more reliable 
engine, more passenger compartment 
space, is as distinctively attractive, 
and sells for much less than the BMW 5-
Series and the Lexus ES 300. An honest 
person will admit that the appearance 
of the car and the maker&#8217;s cachet make 
up the majority of his purchasing 
decisions. Why else would someone 
choose an ES over an Aurora?  The ES is 
$3,000 more than the Aurora, yet it is 
just a Camry with a few appointments 
and for 2002, it has become a 
borderline ugly car. The BMW is just 
overpriced. The Olds has a superior 
engine, is more comfortable inside, is 
just as reliable, and is just as 
attractive. But, its not a ""Beemer"". Is 
that worth 15 grand to you?"

Take a look at the cheap, thin, narrow weather-stripping around the doors and the lack of insulation in the pillars surrounding the doors, and you can understand why this vehicle does such a poor job of keeping the wind noise quiet--especially at highway speeds above 55 mph.

vehicle for the Aurora because the 
Regal had a driver seat with zero

The interior is nice and leather seats
great.  The car has a very stable ride

It's not the best on mileage and it

I love Olds, but I still can't get over the leaking radiator fluid, bad window motor, and faulty EBCM, which lights up your instrument panel like a Christmas tree with all the warnings.

oldsmobile,aurora,2002,Rocket lover, 03/14/2002,Worth owning!,5,"Great value for the money and probably the most under rated vehicle in its class. Excellent build quality, relatively low sales adds to individuality of ownership. Could have created a little more performance for the V-8 given its design. Trying to find the way to afford another one or buy the wife another car so I can have it before she ruins it. Highly recommend trying one out if you're looking for a luxury/sport sedan. I think you'll be surprised. Had one minor problem that was fixed by the dealer first time. Great comfort."

It is quick off the line, and holds its own at highway speeds, never leaving you wanting for passing power. I hope that another line picks up this car when Olds tosses in the towel.  It is the only thing worth salvaging in their line.  I had an Intrigue and will never step down again from the quality of this car."

The looks of the car are deceiving.  I am always asked if is a Mercedes or Infiniti.  It's a shame Olds is going away.  This is a great car.  Seats are big and roomy.  Luxury features like real wood dash are hard to find in a car at this price.  No car in this price range makes the noise it does when you step on it.  I'd say, go get one, you an get a great deal on one.  I do wish the fit was a little tighter.  Squaks come out at the darndest times.  I had that trouble with my Intrigue as well.

Luckily this has been one of the most reliable cars I've ever owned - I replaced the ABS on one of the wheels a few weeks ago.
Other than that, its just been routine maintenance!
My recommendation - try one out for yourself.
I think it all depends on the vehicle.

oldsmobile,bravada,2000,Wayne F., 12/30/2017,Bravada Going Strong 18 yrs and 235K miles,5,"I bought my 2000 AWD Olds Bravada as a left over in November 2000.  Over the years it has had the normal repairs (brakes, shocks etc.) but overall has been an extremely reliable vehicle.  I have had two 4WD Blazers before this vehicle and they could not begin to compare.  Even after 235K miles this car stills handles and rides like a new car and, most importantly, when I leave home I know I will get back home safely in all kinds of weather. The only problems I am encountering now are due to its age and the fact that this vehicle has been used through 18 winters in NE PA and has been exposed to tons of road salt especially on the PA Turnpike. After last winter I had to have the brake lines all replaced because they had rotted but I certainly can't blame the vehicle given the mileage and heavy winter use it has had.  I really love this car and don't look forward to the day I have to replace it.   If I had to pick one negative aspect of this car it would be the gas mileage.  Usually around 13-14.  The best I ever get is maybe 20 on a trip.

AWD works seamlessly, no buttons or levers to worry about. I don't think I will ever get it stuck.

I love how the AWD doesn't require any driver input. This can hold a lot of cargo. I once fit 35 large PC's in back. Interior is laid out nicely with the exception of the CD changer which eats up the console. There are plenty of squeaks and rattles but it is 9 years old with 153K miles.

and looks and is that much differant 
with smarttrac to boot.  Great family 
vehicle without getting a monster suv."
oldsmobile,bravada,2000,SPL, 02/01/2005,Fun to Drive / Buy the Extended Warranty,4,"I purchased the extended warranty that covered the vehicle for 75,000. It turned out to be a great investment due to several problems that occured after the 36,000 mile warranty. I like the vehicles appearance and the Smart Track all wheel drive is a blessing during Iowa winters."

as the king of GM... it's the luxury priced mid-
size SUV with luxury priced repair bills. I've 
spent over $2000 in repairs. I still have to 
replace gas gauge sensor, weather 
stripping/seal. At 62,000 mi, the 
transmission was rebuit to the tune of over 
$1000, at my cost. I've never been in an 
accident or in the ditch, yet had to replace 
both front wheel bearings. 3 months after the 
tranny went bad, yet another expensive gas 
fuel senser went bad.... sorry...but I've had it 
with this one...poor investment for a $38,000 
vehicle."

thought the first one ('98) was a 
fluke with all the troubles we had. No 
such luck.  The '00 Bravada Platinum 
is the biggest peice of crap ever!  
Everything seems to go to hell after 
50,000 miles.  The front end has been 
completely rebuilt now, and we're 
being told the transmission may have 
problems.  Junk, pure and simple."

oldsmobile,bravada,2000,John Helmke, 10/20/2004,Dad's Work Horse,4,"Beats all three Cadillacs I drove 
before. In fact it feels more like a 
Cadillac than they did. I like 
the ""command"" seating position. My wife 
loves the heated seats. A year ago when 
my mother moved into a nursing home we 
loaded as much of her stuff into a 12 
foot UHall trailer and made the 400 
mile trip home without incident. My 
only ""complaint"" is the gas mileage 
with the out of control price rise. In 
the city I get 16 on the road 21 which 
is about what I expected and 
considering what I am getting well 
worth the price. But the $2.25/gallon 
gas is getting me. We are driving my 
wife's 04 Impala and getting 31.25 mpg 
without holding back on the horses. 
Another Impala is looking attractive."
oldsmobile,bravada,2000,oldswoe, 07/29/2005,Pass It Up,2,"Definitely purchase an extended warranty if you get this car(luckily I did)!  At 66,000 miles, I have made over $7,000 in repairs.  The SmartTrak 4WD first didn't engage when needed, then always engaged. I also had the crankcase replaced, U joints, electrical problems, body problems (door hinges all became loose!) My 2002 Dodge Neon did much better in light snow that this! Never risk this purchase."
oldsmobile,bravada,2000,ABQ-NM, 08/02/2005,Great For Mountain Use,4,"Got a good used price on this luxury SUV when we needed something tuff for mountains. The parts man laughed when I tried to get skid plates for under carriage protection. Short wheel base makes for stiff ride in town, but it makes mountain trails ride like a cloud. SmartTrak has been very nice both on slick city streets and mountain paths.  At 50,000 miles the AWD selector(?) motor failed & cost over $1,200 to replace.  SmartTrack definately did not work without it.  Poor mileage (16 city- 21 Hwy) is expensive for relatively small passanger capacity (4.6 adults). Great luxury features in solid vehicle.  Too bad Olds stopped production."
oldsmobile,bravada,2000,Michael Wales, 09/17/2005,Get a Warranty,3,"I purchased my Oldsmobile Bravada in April of 2005, 2 months later it was completely immobile. I'm finally getting it back now after a $2,000 transmission repair (at 85,000 miles).  I love the vehicle, but there is a vast history of transmission problems - be sure to purchase a warranty."
oldsmobile,bravada,2000,UnhappyFloridian, 09/19/2005,Never Again,2,"I was really excited about purchasing my Platinum Edition Oldsmobile Bravada until I started having problems with it.  At 36,000 miles my transmission, rear wiper motor and A/C system all went (glad I bought the extended warranty).  Since then, I have replaced the brakes twice, redone the front end, and keep getting water in my transfer case (car has been in the shop at least six times for this alone).  I never drive in water and they can't figure out what the problem is.  Also, it has lots of rattles.  My ignition shorted twice as did my radio.  My transmission is going again and the roof rack paint is peeling. The jack they provided could not hold the vehicle weight.  Oldsmobile refused to replace a $50 jack free of charge.  I would never purchase an Oldsmobile again."

It looks and drives good but I can't depend on it at all. I just had 2,000 in repairs for the differential, and now the air conditioner is going bad. I love the car but I should have known better then to buy it, I just didn't want an Explorer or a Mountineer."

It is a nice vehicle, but it has it's drawbacks because when I got in my car accident it started having problems and it wouldn't start sometimes. I had to replace my computer in the vehicle and now it runs fine.  I am getting ready to replace my shocks and tires, that way it will ride a lot nicer but it is real quiet and I can barely hear the engine when driving or accelerating.  It has a nice 4.3L V6 engine and it has enough torque but I wouldn't mind more and maybe a better sound system.  "
oldsmobile,bravada,2000,Greg, 06/12/2007,Worst car ever!,2,"This has been the worst car I've ever owned. I'm finally getting rid of it and going back to foreign. I seem to have to get it to the shop every month for work. To date, I think I've put about $6-7k into it to keep it running and it still won't run right. Wants to hesitate and die when I give it gas, and you can't floor it or it dies completely. GM should be ashamed for producing garbage like this. "

The all wheel drive started acting up soon after we got it. I have had to replace the whole front end, rear leaf springs, differential seals, crank seals, and they still can't figure out what is wrong with the electrical system or the A/C system. I have always been a GM guy but I must say if they keep building them like this I may have to switch. Looking forward to getting rid of this lemon. Take my word on this don't ever buy one of these SUVs. This thing also sucks down the gas, I get better economy out of my full size pick up truck.   "
oldsmobile,bravada,2000,slik056, 07/20/2007,Perform maintenance and it will be fine,4,"Vehicle drives nice, some interior creaks from the back when off-roading. Purchased used with 66,000 miles, still running great. Maintain these like the owner's manual says and it should last you a long time. You need to change transmission fluid at least every 50k miles, as stated in the manual. You also need to have the chassis greased every 10k or so to prevent front end repairs (balljoints, steering joints, etc.). Most people ignore the maintenance schedule, then complain  when things break. Every GM vehicle I have owned has had over 200k and ran fine when I sold them, proper care of vehicles makes all the difference. Read and follow maintenance schedules!"

It actually has help up pretty well I guess you can say. But the quality of this car. I have to say GM did a very poor job. I have had to replace so many things on this car, it was probably not even worth it. I could of probably paid off another car with that money. the most stupid feature that I hate is the air pump that apparently is defective in all Blazers and Bravada models 96-01. "
oldsmobile,bravada,2000,Cindy, 04/22/2008,Headache,3,"I go through wheel bearings every year on this. The gas gauge has not worked since it had 65,000 miles. At 70,000 miles the door hinges needed replaced over $500 for that. Now at 94,000 miles the 4 wheel drive is not working. This vehicle has cost me nothing but money. I would not recommend it at all. Numerous other small things has gone wrong with it. and i keep it well maintained and i still have nothing but problems with it."

very little maintence ever needed.
had to change fuel pump and both front wheel bearings but those are common for gm products.

This is my second SUV (first a '97 Blazer) and I've noticed it does not have the rolling effect on turns and curves, very nice!  Pleasure to drive, easy steering, good response to the gas pedal, great sound system (cassette and CD).  I like the wood appoitments in the console, all options are within easy reach and practically placed.  Drink cup holders a little small."
oldsmobile,bravada,2001,JBP, 05/15/2008,A good value,3,"It would be hard to beat this vehicle for the price. We had always driven Subarus and Hondas before buying the Olds. It has had more problems than the Hondas but not the Subaru. None of the problems have been major but have been annoying, like a latch for the back window that has had to be replaced twice and a plaster cover for the window/lock buttons that came off. With 80k-plus miles on it has been very reliable (with consistent oil changes and so on). Frankly, we expected to have more repair expenses with it because of the reviews we'd seen but went with it because we thought the purchase price was great. "
oldsmobile,bravada,2001,Paula, 01/25/2009,Not my fave,2,I only owned my Bravada 18 months because we had to frequently replace the ignition sensor.  Fortunately the warranty covered it so I only had to pay the deductible.  We had bought other used cars from the dealer and decided to trade it in.  We really didn't want to have it go out again (that would be the 4th time) and it would have quaified for the Missouri lemon law.
oldsmobile,bravada,2001,A real waste, 03/02/2008,Stay away,1,"I bought this car new, at the time when olds was thinking of discontinuing the line.  From year four (after the warranty - mileage over)to present, it has cost me $5K to $7K per year in repairs.  It is a sink hole.  Everything from not starting when it feels like it to not being able to turn the wheel without major vibrations.  Everything was changed.  I should have given up a long time ago."

Unlike some of the others on here I have not had to put lots of money in to the truck nor have I had to replace anything other than normal maintenance.  Again some of the reviews that have been posted I would like to say to the commenters, Oldsmobile got bought out they still made Bravadas after they were bought out. This truck is not for everyone honestly. It is the luxury model of the Jimmy & Blazer, if you do not care for those trucks you will not love the Bravada either.  If you take car of your car and don't beat it to crap you should not have any of these problems. "

oldsmobile,bravada,2001,Christova, 03/10/2003,Look elsewhere,2,"I greatly regret my investment in a 
2001 Bravada, especially after 
considering the horribly low 
resale value(I paid 34,000, worth less 
than 15,000 a mere two years later) and 
the terrible build quality.  It is two 
years old but may as well be 10 the way 
it is falling apart. The Bose stereo is 
now useless as the door plastic rattles 
at higher bass like the speakers on a 
$10 walkman. I have had it in for 
service numerous times including 
problems that they just cannot fix.  
For instance, if you crank the wheel 
and back up, the truck grinds and 
grates and just today it did the same 
when I pulled forward and cranked the 
wheel."

The leather seats are very supple and conforming, the lumbar support makes long drives even more comfortable. Excellent rear-round, all utility car, I've got the power moonroof that I use all the time during warm weather. Plenty of storage space, but not too big of a car.  The gas mileage could be a little better, but at about 16-17.5 mpg (depending on driving types) I guess it's not too far off of any other large car. It has the power needed when it's needed!! Used the hitch to pull 2 cars out of ditches last year, SmartTrack works great without any buttons to push as well!  Recommend this vehicle!!"
oldsmobile,bravada,2001,Matt, 09/25/2007,"Good, could be better",4,"I have owned this vehicle for a year now and I like it, a lot! The truck rides very nice and handles well, the interior fit and finish is typical GM business, bad. Doors squeak over rough pavement. I really like the front seats, extremely comfy. Power is decent and I average 18 mpg in town. The transmission shifts smoothly. So far I have 102000 miles on it and I love the way it feels. Not as off road ready as I like, and interior quality is poor, but overall, very good buy. You won't be dissappointed."

many features to list.  The seats fold 
into several useful positions and there 
is good room in back.  My husband is 
6'7 and fits with no complaints  It's

Regularly drive this 120 miles for work and its a better ride than a Lexus. Acceleration is great and turning radius is tight. I am on the original brakes at 100k! Eight yrs in Florida sun and the ac is still going strong.  Had to replace the air suspension bags in the rear. Buy parts online and find a truck specialty shop to install, it's half the dealer cost. The eng is strong but has always been too loud. Had strange elec problems and replaced a box, think it was body control module. The depreciation is horrible, but this makes it a GREAT used car buy! Will keep this until 200k!"

highway) is far better than a Tahoe 
would ever be and it tows boats very 
well.  I pulled a Ski Natique a couple

a conversion van and a small pickup. We 
tested many new vehicles and found the 
used 2002 Bravada with 37,000 miles on 
it was the best choice. It is a very 
classy sport utility that says I AM AN 
OLDSMOBILE. It is very capable of doing 
every job that needs to be done and 
still be fun and luxurious. We wanted 
it to use to carry additional 
passengers comfortably. We needed it to 
pull a utility trailer with a Large 
riding lawnmower. We needed better gas 
mileage for both around town and long 
trips. To me this is the total package.

The ride is as good as any 4 door sedan

will, give power when needed. The gas 
mileage is poor, with air on the best 
is 15--to 16 miles to the gallon in 
town. On the interstate, I - 75 the 
best mileage at 60---65 was 20 to 21.

duplicate the vibration. I live in snow 
country and my front bumper popped 
loose as I backed out of my driveway 
over approximately 6"" of snow! This is 
an SUV and it cannot withstand normal 
winter driving!  I am very disappointed 
and after owning the vehicle for four 
months, I am ready to trade. My AWD 
light came on, but the next day the 
mechanic said the AWD was in working 
order."
oldsmobile,bravada,2002,X Bravada Owner, 02/02/2003,Absolute Junk,2,"I have owned over 40 vehicles, 
including 3 Bravadas. This is 
absolutely the worst vehicle I have 
ever owned. I bought it used with 8K 
miles on it and drove it for a year. I 
had nothing but trouble with it from 
day one, when the fiberglass fan 
disintegrated and took out the 
radiator.  Little did I realize that 
this was the just the start of a long 
and meaningful relationship with my GM 
service department.  Fortunately my 
dealer thought we were seeing a little 
too much of each other and worked with 
me to make me a fair deal on a Buick 
Rendezvous (great vehicle). I can see 
why GM dumped the line."

The overall comfort and ride is vastly 
improved over the mid-1990's GM SUV's 
of which I owned one.  My experience 
on reliability for this vehicle has 
been excellent.  The selection of 
options at time of purchase, in my 
opinion, was more flexible and 
superior to many of the competing 
foreign makes.  It is unfortunate that 
the Oldsmobile division of GM is being 
discontinued.  I recently purchased a

my wife and I were looking for a 
comfortable midsize SUV that did not 
have a third row.  The Bravada is 
extremely comfortable and easy in its 
ride."
oldsmobile,bravada,2002,Rater, 02/27/2008,The Best,4,"My wife and I have really enjoyed this car. We bought used and did have a problem very early with AWD, but fixed under warranty, no further problems. Mirrors are screwy. Otherwise, a great car to drive. Very comfortable for long trips (wish mpg was better on hwy and town.) This is a large vehicle, yet handles very well and acceleration is far better than any SUV I have ever driven, yet ride is almost as comfortable as luxury sedans.   GM's decision to end Olds line was based on misconceptions.  Given this was Olds' last new design, they clearly still knew how to build a car. If GM wanted to cut a line, they should have considered Buick or Pontiac.  If I could buy another, I would!"
oldsmobile,bravada,2002,JP, 02/27/2007,Brilliant Bravada,4,"I've owned the car since 2004 - I purchased it from CarMax with 24,000 miles on it and now have 60,000.  I've haven't had single problem with the vehicle.  I've kept up with regular maintenance.  It's been a remarkably safe, reliable, and strong vehicle.  The exterior looks like new.  I haven't used it to tow anything, however, it has a strong engine that will move quickly at all speed ranges.  It's great on snow and gravel roads.  I haven't taken it off road, but in 6 inch mud it crawls along fine.  I wish Olds didn't fold - they are the highest quality GM make aside from Cadillac in my eyes."

oldsmobile,bravada,2002,Bruce Tonn, 03/20/2007,Great Vehicle,5,The '02 Olds Bravada has been a pleasure to own and drive.  I have had no major problems and with the air suspension it provides a very smooth ride.  The gas mileage has averaged 19.1 MPG city/hwy combined. Parts and service are not a problem since so many mechanical parts are interchangeable with the Chev Trailblazer and GMC Envoy. I highly recommend this vehicle.
oldsmobile,bravada,2002,Scott, 06/04/2007,"75,000 miles and still enjoy it!",4,"Bought it new and 5 years and 75,000 miles without any major problems.

If you do like I did, shop around, but I'm sure you'll find yourself signing the papers on a new 2002 Bravada.  The inline 6 is so smooth, its easy to mistake as a V8. For an 6 cylinder, it produces torque and horsepower so low in the RPM range. Very well engineered and manufactured. Smooth ride, thanks to the air ride suspension."

Now at 139,000 and the only thing, other than regular maintenance, I’ve had to do is replace the rear air bags (not compressor) and a wiper motor last year.   It starts every time, even when it’s 5 degrees outside.  I’ve never charged the A/C.  Fun to drive and so smooth on the highway.  On long road trips I was tracking 22mpg!  In town mpg nothing special at 16.  Paint still shines and no rust even though I drive in snow and it sits outside all year.

Off the bat, the rear air compressor didnt work and it sagged, so we switched to regular shocks. At about 100k the Engine coils started messing up, have had to change 3 so far from the 6 i have to change since apparently they dont last very long. I have since gotten this car now that I left for college about a Year ago. The A/C doesnt work on it anymore now, it shakes every time i turn on the A/C and sometimes the engine even turns on. Bad compressor. The car currently has an issue that when it very cold in the mornings it will give a ""reduced engine power"" light and a check engine light. Recently i have noticed the engine is not that good of quality."

Ive had the truck for two months now and I must say, it is the best vehicle we have ever owned. I love the heated seats, by far my favorite option. The wheels had to go, we replaced them with aftermarket 20"" rims and tires. The sound system isn't bad. I do have one gripe though. The front bumper wiggles around like it's loose. I took it to a diff dealership and they told me that was normal. But I'm sure that's B. S. I wish it had a flip down dvd, as that would quiet the kids. I think that dvd's were an option, I just don't have it. All in all, a great vehicle, much better than its sister trailblazer!"

Right off the bat was sent letter from GM saying sorry, forget to line the piston cylinders, so engine may fail at any time.  Warranty was extended on that engine part only, too bad it wasn't the entire car.  Four wheel drive system has self activated and permanently locked four times, requiring an approx 2000 repair.  Air shocks in rear deflated to the ground daily for years, but dealer couldn't diagnose (or ""duplicate"") the problem until the warranty expired (new air shocks- duh).

oldsmobile,bravada,2002,Mike M, 08/02/2005,Get an extended warranty!!!,3,"I never believed in extended warranties, but this vehicle has made me a believer.  I bought the vehicle with 40,000 miles on it.  The AWD has failed twice on this vehicle for the same reason.  The mirrors never adjust to the driver's setting (which was supposedly fixed), the serpentine belt shredded because of a bad pulley, the shifter cable got caught on the drive train, along with several other (but expensive) nuisances.  "
oldsmobile,bravada,2002,dlflyboy, 03/28/2003,Excellent!!,4,"I bought my Bravada in Oct, 2002. 
Since, I have put 27,000 miles on it 
and the only problem I've had is the 
inside of the driver's door was 
starting to pop out. Had it fixed. The 
only time I'm in the service dept is 
when I'm there for an oil change,tire 
rotation and scheduled tune ups. My 
Bravada is very quite. No loud engine 
noise with mine (not sure why some of 
the other reviewers have loud ones). 
I've had suvs from German to Japanesse. 
I'd rate this as one of the best suvs 
I've owned."

The excellent ride, perfect seating, and outstanding engine sold my wife and I.  Then, I found out that it has a better warranty than the Trailblazer.  I drove it home that day.  I have now had the Bravada for over 6000 mile and 4 months and have not been back to the dealer.  Buy it!  You will not regret it."

Car lost a piston -would not keep car.  GM (Olds) would not help and dealer took me to the cleaners on trade in depreciation for another new Bravada; my course of least resistance.  The newest Bravada has some of the same problems as the first; mirrors do not work properly in reverse mode; radio will not hold settings.  My last GM car.

At 81,000 right front hub failed.  Dealer repair on left for $550.  I repaired right for $180.  Watch brakes.  Replaced at 80,000, needed new rotors all around.  Was told at each inspection that they were getting close.  They did not check the inside pads which were worn much more than outer.  Should have replaced between 60-70,000.  Sun roof track disintegrated in year 6 but still works.  Will try to get 80-100,000 more miles."

choice for my needs.  The ride is as

as good as the MDX.  The demise of 
Oldsmobile possibly was a negative

found 

We also have twice replaced the plastic

Rainier were the extra material to 
deaden noise, wood-trimmed metal door 
handles, Buick grill and optional V8 
engine.  The inside of the two vehicles 
looks the same.  The Buick dealership 
told us the ride and driving abilities 
are the same, the parts are the same,

rear springs is outstanding.  Better 
than most autos.   The inline 6 is 
smooth & powerful.  No wonder it is 
rated one of the top engines by 
automotive engineers.  Brakes are 
best I've every used.  Response is 
perfectly proportional to force applied 
to the pedal.  The ABS stops fast & 
true, even on snow-packed surfaces.  
Handling is very responsive.  The 
stuff about back-end sway in the 
twisties is true, but this is a truck, not 
a sports car.  The only downer with 
the Bravada has been an inability to 
match EPA mileage ratings."

turning on the wipers when it rains!  It
performs really well, and is the
quietest SUV around.  It has more than
enough power, and is fun to drive.  It
even does well in the snow and ice and
one doesn't have to hassel with putting
it into 4WD.  We weren't big on buying
American, but with a bumper-to-bumper 5

a much better buy than essentially the

a Blue Book Trade-in of $24K where the 
Bravada will only bring in $20K. So if 
you are in the hunt to pick up a nice

a quirky problem, if the operator does a
certain combination of movements with

times, three times I had to have it
towed, and three times Onstar couldnt
figure out what it was. I spoke to

the goodies I enjoy in this car.  The

Handling could be better, but it could be a lot worse. I think the interior materials are fine. Engine is awesome, I love Inline 6's. At almost 150000 it hasn't given me any problems that are worth noting. Bought it at 100000. Great family vehicle, and best of all, it's pretty safe.

Our just bought, 62k miles Intrigue, really shocked me with it's smooth performance, handling, acceleration and ride.
I cleaned some carbon off the BTRFLY valve in the throttle body because the pedal was a little sticky and dropped in a new PCV valve ($3) and this car runs again like it is brand new.
Dealer had all the records and showed only typical maintenance, OTW all original.
I am not partial to any brand, and this was used, but I have been very impressed with a 14+yr old car running this well and looking this good.

Everything still works power windows, sun roof, heated seats, power seat and leather seats still good. Rebuilt transmission last year which only cost me $2200, fuel sensor problem is caused by additive in certain gas. Use Shell and you will never have an issue. Replaced flywheel about 5 years ago with a used one.
Lots of available used parts from wrecking yards which keep the cost of repair down because GM does not product a lot of parts for the Olds anymore. Northstar engine is still very strong, no rust although I do undercoat it annually."

Just for that reason, the starter went out. I might add that this girl has 197,000 miles on it. My brother, a local mechanic, says I can easily get 250,000 out of her. She has always burned a little oil, and I am not as diligent on the changes as I should be. I have replaced a few minor parts, which is not a big surprise with the higher mileage. "

After 17 yrs, the air conditioner has stopped working and needs to be checked out( it works but don't blow cold air). The fuses have had to be changed once over the years but that's about it. It is the best riding car in the snow and other bad weather. My Intrigue now has 167,000 miles and still rides smooth and quiet. I would definitely buy a new one if they still made them!

oldsmobile,intrigue,2000,BK, 09/17/2015,Not the greatest,2,"This was my first car I had at 16 and owned it for 7 years. Bought it used with around 70,000 miles and worked good for the first year or 2. Performance was pretty good for a ""grandma"" car, putting the pedal down going about 30 would still break the tires loose. Understeer was as expected in a front wheel drive but it did well in the winter as long as there wasn't a huge snow storm. There were several things that went bad in the years I had it though. Wheel bearings were terrible. After about 2 years I had to replace the front bearings. Not long after that the rear ones went out. And about 3 years after replacing the rear bearings they went out again. 6 bearings for a car with 4 wheels over about a 5 or 6 year period is ridiculous, I initially blamed my driving thinking I took corners maybe faster than the car was meant for but I have since learned this was a common problem with the vehicle. About 3 years into owning it the electronic control module crapped out and wasn't worth the estimated $1000 for the dealership to fix it so I lived with it. This going out caused the dashboard to look like a christmas tree, no ABS, no traction control, the power steering just felt different but I can't describe the feeling even though it wasn't bad it was just different, the precision control didn't work even though I wasn't sure what that even did so that may be where the power steering felt different, electronics in the cab would do weird things like turn off the cruise control if you roll a window down and things of that nature. The cool thing about the ECM going out was the governor also went with it so one time while passing 4 cars I was able to take it to 126 before I decided it was smart to let off the gas. Passenger rear window went out and the replacement motor only worked for a few months so I believe the ECM going out had something to do with this. One spring the car was idling real low and would die at stop lights and that turned out to be a sensor in the engine. Another time the car idled way too high and I had to shift it into neutral at stop lights while onlookers probably thought I was showing off by revving the engine and then slamming it into gear, that was another sensor issue in the engine. And towards the end of my time with the vehicle it just shifted like crap, hard shifts and had problems finding the right gear to be in. This vehicle was probably my last experience I will ever have with a GM, there was always something wrong with it.

It doesn't burn or leak oil, but it takes 4L of oil for every tank of gas.

The fake wood paneling is cheap and is cracking on the dashboard. The rear power window stopped working and that was only after a handful of times using it. It burns way too much oil.

Have had this on a race track (Road America road course in Wis.) for over an hour chasing (and passing) BMW's back in 2001; Great handling; OK used, but epxect some issues. "
oldsmobile,intrigue,2000,BB, 03/20/2010,Best Car!,4,My 2000 Intrigue has 250K miles on it and the only issue I've had is a hairline crack in the coolant tank and an axle that had to be replaced.  As a single working mother of 4 kids this car has been a lifesaver.  There is nothing worse than having an unreliable car.  I am currently looking for the same year model car as a back up for this car.  I'm not sure how much longer it can go but it just keeps on going.  
oldsmobile,intrigue,2000,not too shabby, 03/25/2010,happy with it,4,"We bought our intrigue w/ over 100,000 mi. On it and it runs great! Plenty of power and pick up w/ engine is awesome. I do have 2 big complaints though. The window control assembly on driver side pops out at will and I'm sure it wont be long before the buttons on it stop working. And the suspension on it deteriorated very quickly and now it is a horrible ride on any slightly bumpy surface. It sounds rough like it may knock a tire off or worse. But overall, it has been a very good second car for us and I love the way it still looks for its age. For me,  mechanically it has been a good purchase and I plan to drive for a long time to come."

the last 30 months since I have owned 
this car, two small items have been 
replaced (never been stuck on the road) 
plus a sticky driver's door that was 
retuned"" twice by the dealer.
The car is a pleasure to drive; why GM 
is not continuing this design under 
another name beats me - OLDS is the 
only GM line now in touch with the 
american ""urban"" reality (I mean 
closest to it because there is still 
room for improvement) in the Northeast 
and Coastal West. All other designs 
look pretty ugly to me and some are 10 
years behind."

deployed properly.  Two kids in back in carseats-3yo with seat belt bruises, 
18mo with minor seat belt marks.  Driver-minor injuries."
oldsmobile,intrigue,2000,jeneep, 09/25/2010,Very Disappointed,2,"I bought this just just before Halloween last year - not quite one year - with 101,000 miles. I had no issues with the car. Most were with the dealership for not taking care of regular maintenance before I bought it. I had actually enjoyed the power it had! And then my transmission failed on me. I'm a single mother and the sole reason I bought this car was because I thought it was reliable. Apparently I should have researched more because it's a well known problem on other boards. Here I am stuck with a $1700+ fix on top of the loan I already have. Thanks a lot, Oldsmobile! Research the car - I wouldn't trust the transmission, and I'm sure you don't want the expensive fix."
oldsmobile,intrigue,2000,Augustine, 09/29/2010,"Good, until...",3,"I bought this car with 36,000 miles 7 years ago and it lasted 100,000 miles.  It's got its share of minor issues, like all windows had to have the regulator replaced as well as the crankshaft sensor, which seem to be the par for the course.  The interior was a victim of its poor quality in materials and design early on, like the dash lip above the central vents raising and the shifter and door switches getting loose.  The leather seats were only thinly upholstered and the driver's seat shows more use.  The exterior, other than supplier-painted parts, held up fairly well.  Since it was involved in an accident which damaged its front-end, it developed recurring cooling issues, unfortunately."
oldsmobile,intrigue,2000,rpharasty, 08/18/2002,Good Design but Poor Worksmanship,3,"This vehicle has an attractive design

however has been poor.  Steering and 
Alignment problems have never been 
properly fixed by dealership.  It 
sqeaks and rattles over uneven pavement

oldsmobile,intrigue,2000,aileron, 04/03/2002,Intrigued - no longer,3,"The 3.5 twin cam engine is the best feature of the car. The transmission, at 75000 miles, 
is becoming ""unsure of itself"". Fit and finish are not good. Interior layout is OK. 
Service reliability has been subpar for a car that lists for over 26 grand.
Fog lights are ridiculous - lousy design - bulbs don't last and cost a fortune at
10-14 dollars each. The assemblies fill up with water and list for 113 dollars each.
The headlight assys are little better as the lenses fog over (crazing) and condensation
always forms inside the light assemblies. I'm afraid to even inquire the price.
I'll go Japanese next time."

I have not had a single problem.  The car is great to drive, good acceleration and handling.  I recently took it on a road trip to LA from Phoenix and it was a dream to entire trip; had the cruise control set at nearly 100mph and it was still under 3000rpm."

13,159 miles on it.  It still has the 
new car smell.  On my test drive the 
brakes squeaked, but I attributed that 
to the fact the car had been sitting 
idle.  Once I took delivery the noise 
subsided.  Now 6/12/03 the car has 
17,600 miles and I am getting 
pronounced feedback from the brake 
pedal and the car shutters when the 
brakes are applied.  This is my first 
GM car, I have previously owned 2 
Fords, a Toyota and a Nissan because I 
was always skeptical about the quality 
of GM and Chrysler vehicles.  I hope my

unfounded.  I have an appointment for

would not change anything regarding
design and function of equipment. I
compare it to my son's BMW 500 series

oldsmobile,intrigue,2000,unreliable2000, 01/14/2005,"Good Car, Bad Quality",3,"Would have been an excellent car if reliability and build quality were better.  I had it for 3 years and only put 24,000 miles on it.  Here is what had to be replaced: rack and pinion steering, cv-joints, thermostat, horn, cd player, and alternator.  Not normal for a 24,000 mile car.  I also had probems with an erratic check engine light.  The car was comfortable and rode well, and the performance was good.  Performance would have been excellent if it had a 5 speed auto or 6 speed manual. Traction was also very poor in the snow.  Interior was of modern Japanese design, but the plastics quality was 1970's American.  I was going to keep the car after the lease was turned it in after all the trouble."

I love it, it has had no mechanical problems so far and I wish that they still made them. I love the power of the 3.5L Twin Cam V6. It's so great. For my first car that I've bought on my own, I am more than happy. I would recommend this car to anyone. Well, anyone interested in buying a quality car that can whoop an imports butt when it needs to, while remaining extremely practical and gets great gas mileage. I love this car!

The passenger side does not hide.

are some rear brake noise, not bad 
though and the passenger door sticks,

I have a bad back, and even with that, I can make 600 miles in a day. This is one comfortable car and its fuel mileage is 29 to 31 mpg on the road, and that makes me smile a lot. What I don't like is the two break jobs that I have needed in the past year.  Also, the cheap turn signal light sockets that should be about $0.69 to replace and cost $30.00 at the dealer.

alternator short problems with the 
lights dimming on the Intrigue.  My 
flasher unit is intermittently faulty,

40k miles it developed an oil

1qt in about 1200 miles. There is no 
oil on the garage floor and it doesn't 
somke. I personally change the oil and 
perform most maintenance. I have never 
seen a car burn out so many dash bulbs 
like this does. I hate the rock hard 
arm rests, my FORD F350 had FAR 
superior arm rests. I'm 6'3"" (not 
terribly tall) and my head rubs the 
ceiling of the car, I would hate to be 
any taller! The throttle valve has a 
problem of getting coated with gunk

the car leaps forward when you finally 
break the throttle loose. "
oldsmobile,intrigue,2000,Keith, 03/18/2006,Darn good car,4,"Bought this as a poor man's Aurora, the Intrigue, and was not disappointed.  It has had outstanding reliability - the only major maintenance that was needed was new front disks and a transmission rebuild at 108,000 miles.  The engine still smogs clean and gets 26 MPG at 125,000 miles.  The interior and exterior have held up as well - from both a styling and performance perspective - with only a broken cupholder and a slight gap between a AC vent and the dashboard from shrinkage or a bad initial fit.

This car has everything, leather, dual zone climate, electric shocks, but no moonroof. It has the best seat support you can find.  I wish they were heated and vibrated for my back.

Once I find a solution to my leaking rims that doesn't cost $1,000 to fix I will be able to relax.  Other than that, the gas mileage is poor.

The vehicle features one of the largest trunks on Earth so storage not an issue here. However at 82,000 miles with regular service I am running into problems. A common one seems to be the gas gauge. It stopped working around 60,000 and I have not tried to fix it, also the a/c heating element is shot so it only blows on the highest setting. The driver door is also causing problems now. SO I say its good but not so good. A fast, safe, average car"

Also, the lights flicker and dim on occasion, which is a known issue. Also, resale value is horrible on this car. The engine, so far, has worked great with no major problems. The issues I have with the car are not covered by a warranty, including some that known issues and should be recalled."
oldsmobile,intrigue,2001,navyfire, 04/23/2009,Overall a good car,4,"I owned this car for 2 years and was very pleased with it. I bought it with 60k and it was mostly trouble free except for a few minor problems: The check engine light came on shortly after I bought it, a check indicated a problem with the ""secondary air injection system.""  The front suspension developed a loose feeling and vibrated a lot during braking.  The ignition developed an issue where it wouldn't read the security code for the key and disable the engine.  This was the most irritating problem the car had and often left me stranded.  Overall, after 98k was put on it, I would definitely buy another.  "

I give it a tune-up every year and regular oil changes, other than that no other maintenance.

I've put over 150,000 miles on this car myself and have never replaced more than the tires and oil filter. Granted, the turn signals and gas gage are no longer working. Almost every interior dash light is on, and the steering seems to be going out....the engine just keeps on running! I wrote this car off about 50,000 miles ago but nope, she's still kicking. Also, still gets aroun 28-30 miles to the gallon. Have to keep track by hand no so I dont run out out gas but hey, she doesnt owe me anything at this point. "
oldsmobile,intrigue,2001,donjustfine, 02/12/2002,Rattles,3,"After owning the car for several months, I have noticed a hint of cheapness in the interior.  First the clear plastic cover over the speedometer etc started to rattle on rough surfaces.  Glove box has also started to rattle now.  Also had to replace alternator after 2000 because of lights dimming.  Nice car, but not especially impressed with initial build quality.  However, the engine is top notch."
oldsmobile,intrigue,2001,miranda, 06/04/2006,Still love it,4,"I bought my Olds brand new in 2001 and have put over 107,000 miles on it.  I absolutely love my car.  It handles great in all weather, with relatively low maintenance.  I've put new tires and brakes on it but that's normal wear-and-tear for 107,000 miles.  The duo heated-leather seats, moonroof and stability control are my ""must-have's.""  I was doing a bit of looking around for a potential new car after I hit the 100,000 miles mark and cannot find anything close to my Olds for under $35,000.  Last weekend I put 8 bags of mulch in the trunk with the door CLOSED.  GM had a winner with the Intrigue but now is no more."

Nothing major at all except for the crank sensors which, never stranded me.  Aside from a few broken power windows, this car has been fantastic.  Runs smooth, quiet and comfortable.  Only downfall is that it has the northstar v6 cadillac engine which you must baby.  Oil changes, coolant flushes and a tune up must be done.  Engine will go well over 200,000 miles.

I bought it and then 3 months later had to replace the engine. 3 months after that had to replace the struts, which by the way cost almost 300 each! Now all the lights are on, on the dash. The signals do not work anymore. And the car started randomly shutting off while you are driving! Most of the time you try to start it and it acts like it has a dead battery.

no major problems.  On the other hand,

I didn't need another car, but , a few years later, I'm still happy with this purchase.  It was one of the sportiest American midsize sedans of the day. The major critique it received was about finish quality; however, all I could find wrong with my car was a side dash plastic panel fitted poorly.  GM management should have kept the oldest car brand existing, not dump it. I believe they should have upgraded the Oldsmobile lineup, instead of coming up with the dubious GTO, SSR, etc..."
oldsmobile,intrigue,2001,AMR, 02/17/2005,A Very Refined Performer All Around,5,"This car was bought used, but was in such good condition that I could not pass the sale up.  The Intrigue is stylish, comfortable, and an able performer (with the 3.5 DOHC V6).  I really like the takeoff of the vehicle and the fuel economy; both are excellent.  The interior design is not too bold, but it is stylish.  The exterior was a departure from traditional ""Oldsmobile boringness"" and brought a sense of fresh air.  The interior has great fit and finish and build quality is excellent; not a squeak or rattle even at nearly 50,000 miles!  I would recommend this car to anyone who is looking for a comfortable high quality used vehicle."

repairs either, things like, front

You can definately feel the quality difference between the two cars. I chose a beautiful Ruby Red Metallic GL with every option available on that model.

Reliable, fun to drive, powerful, super economical, very roomy, supportive seats, great cornering, and superior braking, make it a perfect sporty alternative to bring sedans. Compared to Accord, Camry, Passat, and Maxima, when I was shopping. Intrigue felt like it was built better, with more quality feel to it. Plus the motor is Northstar inspired, and borrowed from the Aurora. The acceleration and passing ability are far better than the numbers most magazine put out. I've clocked mine from 0-60 with a professional stopwatch. The timing was averaged at 6.49 over 5 trials. Fuel economy is averaging in the 30's.

Even though I'm only 18, I think this is one of the best cars out there.  It's fast, yet relaxing when cruising, comfortable (heated seats!!), it's got a good Bose sound system, and it handles well.

I normally get around 400-440 miles to one tank of gas! Moving on to the interior, it is a very beautiful designed interior! As most Intrigues go, my dash above my center air vents started to raise at 120,000 miles but thats no big deal. The car has never had any mechanical problems in it's 180k mile life. The only problem I have had is wheel hubs. Wheel hubs are another common thing with the Intrigue, 300 dollars later, all four hubs were replaced..      "

When I purchased it the dash lights stayed on like a Christmas tree but after driving it I had to have it. It now has 80K miles on it and although the lights on the dash are still there it runs like a dream and is very dependable. Nobody seems to know why the lights stay on so it can be fixed but as long as it continues to give me good service I can't complain as it was a lot of car for the money I spent.

The car seemed to always have this issue with the blinker turning right. I was told that it is a sensor and is around 400$ to replace NO THANKS! Common issue with these cars i am told ill go without! Then my car one day decided to start stalling on me in the middle of intersections and when i was driving normally! it was scary trust me but i didn't do anything about it until one day i went to go start it and it wouldn't at all so i jumped it but every time it would bog out after a few minutes! I got so sick of it i let it sit there all winter without even driving it because i didn't want to deal with it! Anyway i took it to a GM dealership and 500$ later with a cam shift sensor and a new battery the car seems great now! Love how it drives and handles curves and the acceleration is great! I would recommend getting it looked at before you buy and do your research on the car because they can have some costly repairs unfortunately

oldsmobile,intrigue,2002,K. Gilligan, 01/04/2007,Excellent Olds!,4,"I bought a loaded up base model in a dealer end of year clearance.  It is the best car I've ever had (and I usually buy Mazda, Honda or Toyota).  It has the best engine ever.  It's smooth, powerful, quiet and yet gets great gas mileage.  This car's understated styling still gets curious onlookers.  Its beefy Goodyear tires, ABS, a smooth transmission are all excellent.  My only gripe is the standard GM penchant for ill fitting dashboard plastics.  I have had no squeaks, rattles, or maintenance issues with my Intrigue.  It has been completely reliable and has plenty of power.  The suspension eats up bumps.  The handling is tight, especially for a deceptively large sedan.  This car easily outperforms every other car in its size/class for much less money.  I wholeheartedly recommend it!"

I do outside sales on the road, I now have 90k on it. Other than basic repairs (tires, battery) it has been problem free. Comfortable for long trips, rides smooth, and the A/C blows colder and cools faster than my wifes 2006 Chevy Impala! Why did GM kill Olds? My sister just bought herself one with low miles.

We got the GLS fully loaded for about $25,000.  After 8 years and closing in on 200,000 miles, (not a typo), it is the best car I have ever owned, hands down.  Impressive pick up for a car of that size.  The 3.5L V6 with regular maintenance is as durable as they come, and still purrs like a kitten.  The optional ""Precision Control System"" gives the car great handling, especially around curves at higher speeds, and the ride comfort is very good for a sportier car.  Still getting 24/28 mpg. A great car.  Too bad GM couldn't sell more of them."

I have owned many Oldsmobiles and the Intrigue is the best-balanced Oldsmobile that I have driven.  The Intrigue handles as well if not better than many compact performance cars.  Don't just look at the car.  Test drive it!  I was surprised.  You may be too."

Other than that no unscheduled services required. 90 percent of my driving is in the city and the car averages 19 miles-per-gallon. All-in-all it's been a pretty darn nice car!"

is so quiet, responsive, economical, 
and the transmission is also very 
smooth.  As with all GM vehicles, 
however the transmission has no 
compression braking. Therefore I'm 
expecting the brake pads to wear out 
sooner than they did on my Honda

not possible to get air flow on side 
windows as well as the defrost and 
floor at the same time as on my Honda."

Intrigue, my second GL and a 
replacement for my 1999, which I drove 
for about 33,000 miles. Simply put, I 
just could not turn down the 
incentives. GM is making a major 
mistake in not continuing this car, 
even in another guise (e.g., Buick or 
Pontiac). Improvements include more 
precise steering and an improved sound 
system, as well as a blessedly silent 
horn when using the remote locking 
system. Handling seems a tad softer, 
however,and the car seems to reach its 
side loading limits rather abruptly in 
sweeping turns. Gas mileage is about 
the same (mediocre), but the engine 
still provides plenty of grunt when 
asked, perhaps my favorite feature."

GL with the 3.5L motor (56,000 miles).I 
drive a combination of city and 
highway.It's a really good car for the 
most part; but, I have one HUGE 
complaint.  It burns oil like you 
wouldn't believe. For those of you out 
there who wait for the ""Change Oil"" 
light to come on before simply heading 
to the lube shop, I have a very rude 
awakening for you.  The first time I 
checked my oil after 4000 miles(before 
light came on) there was only a trace 
of oil on the stick. Now,I check my oil 
every 1000 miles and this car burns a 
quart of oil every 2500 miles.The 
dealer checked this and said it was 
normal?  Anyone else have this issue?"
oldsmobile,intrigue,2002,Tryan, 01/30/2003,Intrigue features high highs & low lows,3,"Its styling is the first thing that 
grabs your attention.  It is, simply 
put, stunning. Unlike the Accord and 
Camry that you see everywhere, the 
Intrigue is more rare and you never get 
sick of seeing them. However, also 
unlike the Accord and Camry, is the 
Intrigue's build quality.  It is barely 
acceptable. It's paint job is 
horrendous, the gaps in the dash fits 
are huge, and shakes and rattles are 
already obvious.  For such a large car, 
the rear seat space is tight. The car 
has plenty of ergonomic quirks (like 
useless cup holders) and finding the 
perfect temperature is a waste of time -
 you either get very hot, or very cold. 
The intermediate does not exist."
oldsmobile,intrigue,2002,Touring Fool, 09/26/2003,Touring Champ,4,"Great car.  V6 is a gem of performance 
and economy. I gave up only 2 MPG (to 
23-24 MPG) around town going from a 4-
cyl to this car, and get similar 
freeway mileage (30-32MPG at 70-75mph). 
Interior design is great; nice touches 
with the steering wheel audio controls 
and dual zone automatic AC. Power 
heated leather is very comfortable 
(drove 5400 miles over two weeks this 
past summer). Downside is typical GM 
trim panel loosening with age (dash 
squeak) and large seams between panels. 
The handling and ride compromise is 
unbeatable - cruises in comfort over 
rough pavement at speed but encourages 
getting off the freeway in search of a 
twisty two lane."

decided to take the plunge. I donot 
regret it at all, it handles and rides 
extremely well, very quiet, and very 
thrifty on gas. The car also has 
adequate power for any traffic 
conditions. The only problem I had 
with this vehicle,was that there was 
slight water leak into the trunk when

This is the best overall car I have ever owned.  I get 29-30 miles per gallon on the road and 25 in town.  It is extremely comfortable to drive.  Even with a bad back, I can drive the car for 4-5 hours and leave it with no discomfort. The front power seat, according to my wife, is the most comfortable she has ever ridden in.

I occasionally drive the car, and it is always a pleasure.  It is very comfortable,handles well,plenty of power and loaded with features.  This car has been rock solid reliable through 67k miles (knock on wood). The OHC engine took a little getting used to.  I'm used to the classic push rod grunt off the line and then power fade at 4000 or so rpm.  Exactly the opposite happens with the 3.5 OHC. Overall we are VERY pleased with the Intrigue.

It was the best of GM's W-body platform cars (Grand Prix, Regal, Impala) with clean styling, the fine 3.5L twincam engine, crisp handling and steering, and all-around road manners.  I bought my Intrigue after it had a year's service in a fleet and I couldn't be happier. It drives very nicely, is comfortable, quiet, and fast, and if you want to have a little fun that engine just loves to rev.

There were a few minor quality issues - water pump had to be replaced (at normal service visit), and a nut on one of the wipers had to be retightened (10 minutes at another Olds dealer).  Both of these were fixed under warranty, and neither left me stuck.  I got a lot of car for the money, and put a lot of worry free miles on it.  I rated a lot of 8's, and that's because there are such things as Lexus, Infiniti, etc., but compared to the price range the Intrigue competed in (Accords, Camrys, etc), the Intrigue was a great car and a great value"

It has the new for 2002 Tropic Teal color and has been a fantastic performer, and for only $625! It had only 54,622 miles and was ""living"" close to where it was built at the Fairfax, Kansas City GM plant. All GLS models had the sunroof, dual power seats and two-tone leather interior. I bought both a replacement right front fender and a front right door for $24 apiece. My  dealership  body shop repaired and repainted everything for $700. Every year I drive a different car to the Highway Earth car show in Beverly Hills and I drove this Intrigue there in 2018.
The only problem occurred two months ago when the ""Service Engine Soon"" light came on. I ran the codes and got the one for the Crankshaft Position Sensor. Easy fix! $96 for the exact AC Delco part from Rock Auto and installed the same day the part arrived.
Easily one of the best cars ever built and I sold Oldsmobiles for fifteen years, 1990 to 2004.

Has made several long, out of state trips and is our primary in town ride. I've replaced battery, starter, idle control valve, belt and tensioner, tailgate lift cylinders, and rear air shocks. Took to dealer for a bad crank speed sensor wiring harness - $600 total repair. All reasonable repairs for a vehicle this age. Love the space and seats. Excellent fuel economy. Nice driver. Solid overall construction. Has been a reliable and very good van for hauling kids to ball games, moving music equipment, and everything else! 

UPDATE: Sadly, some kid turned into my daughter while driving this van and totaled it. We could drive it up onto the wrecker, but the cost to repair the broken front end was just not economical. We bought a different brand of minivan to replace the Silhouette and I appreciate the Silhouette even more now.

I tow a 3500 lb boat medium distances and this van tows great but lacks 4 wheel drive.  The driver heated seat quit working though at 100k.  I really need a 4x4 but I hate to see it go.  A tip, I put a $1 bottle of fuel injector cleaner in the gas one time and the power increase was huge.  "
oldsmobile,silhouette,2000,Deloris Kotowske, 11/05/2010,Best vehicle I ever owned,5,"Love my Olds Silhouette and would buy another one if they were still making them.  I tell everyone how absolutely wonderful this vehicle is.  Economical on gas, comfortable for traveling and my grandkids love riding in it.  Easy to get into and out of which is an especially nice feature for older folks and those with certain back problems.  No tugging to pull yourself up and out of the seat to exit the vehicle.  Plus ease of motion to get into the vehicle.  What a shame this awesome vehicle has been dis- continued.  I have about 128,00 miles with nominal repairs. What a blessing financially that is in this day and age with repair bills soaring out of site. Fantastic mode of transportation."
oldsmobile,silhouette,2000,Todd, 01/10/2007,"Great Van, but Interior Not Dependable",4,"I bought this van with 12 miles on it and have put over 126,000 on it. There has NEVER been a mechanical failure, but it has had several problems with interior things. The power door had to be repaired three times, power windows twice, power door locks three times. Its gas mileage is outstanding, averaging 25 mpg.  This van provides great comfort.  Overall I am very pleased with it."
oldsmobile,silhouette,2000,bbcro, 04/20/2003,"Not a Toyota, But not Bad",4,"Initially disappointed w/interior 
build quality and materials.  Things 
fell off and we didn't know where they 
came from (read, VERY plastic 
interior).  Radio has been replaced 3 
times, right door speaker twice, 
driver side seat heater twice, and 
rear window washer has failed so many 
times I gave up on it.  But... the 
dealer was terrific (Bush Olds/GMC, 
Lenoir NC) always ready with a loaner 
and would pick up/drop off if 
necessary.  Last van was Previa, 
better overall quality, but Olds is 
much more car-like and cheaper to 
repair."
oldsmobile,silhouette,2000,Terri, 10/27/2010,First Lemon I have owned,3,"I like the drive, room, features, etc. and it ends there.  I have owned this van for 8 years and this is what has gone wrong above regular maintenance issues:  front windshield wipers - never worked properly, power windows - have to hand pull the windows up, fuel gauge broken, heated seats died after three years, problems with automatic sliding door, tires always going flat - the list goes on and on.  I spent $4,000 in fixes last year alone.  The best I can get for it on trade is $1,500.  Not impressed."

I used it for my big family of 6 kids, and now they are not here any more and now just have 3 kids. It was very good on road trips and daily communicating, it got pretty good gas mileage also. Had to buy another motor for it but it now has over 250,000 miles on it. However, this car is not safe at all. But It has been a good van and the best car i have ever owned."
oldsmobile,silhouette,2000,Ny oldsie, 01/08/2006,Super Silky Silhouette,5,"The Oldsmobile Silhouette is a well thought out example of what America makes best!  This van has a low cost to maintain.  I recommend changing the dex-coolant every 3 years or 75,000 miles whichever comes first and remember to include the anti-leak tablets as per factory specifications! This vehicle will reward you with years of trouble free driving! Who says they don't make 'em like they used to!  PS...I am still on the original Delco battery after six years of ownership!"

For a minivan it has some punch, gets comparably great gas mileage, and our minivan though it has 111,000 miles rides as smooth as the day it was bought i suspect.  The interior was well thought out though, I find that the cup holders are in some odd places. all in all pretty happy with our purchase.  3600 out the door at the local dealership with a tank full of gas and an oil change."

oldsmobile,silhouette,2000,Jeff, 06/24/2005,Sorry to see Olds go!,3,Our 2000 Extended Premier Edition Silhouette with all the leather and video toys is a very cool and comfortable ride. The car has spent many days in the dealer repair shop for work on brakes and manifold. The front end has been aligned three times but still goes through tires quick.  This is the first front wheel drive car I've owned and I'm not a fan.  Gas mileage for this big van is awesome and my wife is always running the AC. 
oldsmobile,silhouette,2000,psloan, 02/07/2006,2000 Oldsmobile Silhouette,3,"Our Oldsmobile Silhouette hasn't left us stranded yet.  Its engine has always run strong and smoothly other than an occasional hard start.  As far as problems go, it had the passenger side window serviced under warranty at least twice.  It is still slow going up and down.  I also had to have the the VCR serviced once and it's out again.  The dealer has not been helpful on this one.  It has a squeaking and rattling from the back hatch area when going over bumps. We just replaced the water pump at 88,000 miles.  The fuel gauge doesn't work and now the thermostat seems to be stuck open.  It sounds like a diesel after cold start up. "
oldsmobile,silhouette,2000,finderskeepers, 02/27/2006,"Ok, but some problems",3,"We bought our Silhouette for its creature comforts, but many of them have since failed us. It has 60,000 miles on it, but the rear air no longer works, nor does the driver's heated seat. I have had the rear air shocks replaced (not cheap), the battery replaced, and the original spec tires were gone by 40,000 miles. The engine always sounds like a diesel on start-up, lots of knocking going on until warmed up.  On the plus side, it always starts, ihas buttery smooth leather seats, has a comfortable ride, and adequate power (but not overwhelming). I like the good sounding audio system and genuine 7 passenger seating."

Now I hear I need to fix it again (jarring gears).  I included traction control problems last time.  I did not run it hard (I drive like grandma on purpose) but it did not solve this $4000 later. It runs quiet and smooth sometimes, but I can't put off a transmission repair for complications failure would have - seen elsewhere. It was in the shop a long time despite being partially covered by a plan and monitored for that.

oldsmobile,silhouette,2001,countyworker, 10/23/2013,never buy GM again,1,I have over the past 10 years poured a lot of money into this van . While I like the leather seats and all the options being a premiere edition the intake and head gaskets went twice a transmission rebuild ones at 85000 miles heated seats repaired twice broke again had way to many over heating problems just to many things to list .If you like big repair bills by a GM mini van. The van spent more time being repaired than me driving it never get me again GM.
oldsmobile,silhouette,2001,steelymommy, 01/11/2014,Worst vehicle I've ever owned.,2,"I hate this van! The seat heaters quit working,can live w/that, the speakers SUCK. Power door on the passenger side not only doesn't work but will not unlock w/the electronic locks or manually so it can't be opened at all. I've replaced Battery, thermostat, heater/AC blower motor, the resistor(that melted), water pump, belt, Intake Manifold gaskets(top &bottom), heater hose. The entire engine cooling system & heater/AC system cannot handle the pressure &original parts corrode quickly! It's fuel injected but have to give it gas to start it. And now it needs a new Harmonic Balancer-because they couldn't just bolt on the pulley for the belt, they used something rubber that corrodes too!"
oldsmobile,silhouette,2001,CCC Chicago, 02/22/2007,Excellent Value,4,"This was our second Silhouette. Our first was a '94 and it served our family well. After seven years it began to have a some minor issues and we traded for the '01 GLS. It has served us without any major problems or issues for 5 1/2 years now. It only has 55,000 miles. I can't speak highly enough on the reliability of this vehicle. I tow jet skis with it. Pile kids into it. Haul cargo in it. Move easily through the snow in it. I'm one person who has loved my minivans over the past 13 years or so, but my next car will probably be some type of crossover. On the '01, I put on a new set of tires at about 45,000 miles and a new battery after 5 years. This has been an excellent family vehicle."
oldsmobile,silhouette,2001,nobehappy, 08/13/2009,If you own it sell it,3,"Good looking with lots of features.  But way too many mechanical problems.  Heated seats went right after the warranty.  The gasket problems cost a fortune to fix and occur over and over.  The transmission gave out at 110k miles.  Towed to Olds dealer.  They quoted $3,400 for them to fix and another $625 for other problems they found on the diagnostics tests.  It is going to the junk yard as it is not worth fixing.  I really regret buying this thing...just shows how far they are behind in matching the higher- quality build of Honda's and Toyota's.  It is no wonder GM has problems getting people to want to buy their vehicles and trust them after experiences like this."

not a rough driver, and I've just 
bought my 3rd transmission and only 
have 66,000 miles on it. I've had it

oldsmobile,silhouette,2001,Tom, 11/20/2005,Class with Reliability!,4,"The 2001 Oldsmobile Silhouette is an excellent van for the money.  It's loaded with features and very reliable.  I purchased mine with 44,000 miles on it and now have 67,000 miles.  I have owned it for 14 months with no problems.  If snow is in your area I'd recommend the AWD version available in years 2002 - 2004.  Our does not have AWD and that is the only option we wish we had.  It gets respectable fuel mileage...23 miles per gallon overall with combined city/highway driving.  We get 29 mpg if we burn a full tank on the Interstate averaging 70 mph.  This van has respectable handling, power and reliability.  I would recommend it over the Pontiac Montana.........the Silhoutte is a much classier vehicle on the inside and outside.  Consider a Silhouette if you're looking for a good used family van."
oldsmobile,silhouette,2001,mrkdrv, 02/26/2006,Happy With This One,4,"I bought my Oldsmobile Silhouette new and five years later I am still happy with it.  It has had no major problems to speak of.  The only time I had it at the dealer was to fix the blower, it had lost low speed and the heater in the passenger seat died. Both were fixed without issue.  I replaced the front brakes twice, tires twice, and rear brakes once.  I am happy with the accelation also.  It isn't a race car but I can merge onto a highway without feeling like I'm going to get creamed."
oldsmobile,silhouette,2001,vanowner, 05/16/2006,2000 Oldsmobile Silhouette,4,"Besdies the usual, I transport 6-7 adults with luggage 4-6 times a year so rear seat headroom is very important to me.  The 24 mpg that I have been getting has been excellent for the size of the vehicle. My costs were only wear and tear and recommended maintenance, except for an intake gasket related to the cooling system that apparently is a weak feature in GM cars. Replacing that cost $1,000 when I was out of town on a trip.  This has been a very comfortable, efficient, reliable road vehicle. "
oldsmobile,silhouette,2001,Traveling Dad, 01/09/2007,Great Van,5,"I do lots of driving to nearby states and lots of city driving. My Silhouette needed a minor transmission overhaul at 67,000 and an intake gasket at 74,000.  I am on my third set of tires, but have needed no front suspension repairs. I will say that Michellin Hydra tires & now Goodyear Assurance, really make the ride comfortable and reassuring."
oldsmobile,silhouette,2001,Les, 05/16/2017,Great find for a used vehicle,4,"Bought this with 148k on the odometer. Paid less than the low value of KBB for a vehicle in this condition. I had to do some immediate but minor repairs to bring it up to my standards, i.e. new battery (old one was 7 years old), new tail lights (cracked lens and full of water), clean headlamp lens (clouded), and detailing the interior. Since then it has been running great and the fuel economy has been a most pleasant surprise. At first the cruise control didn't work but I found out that by fixing the taillight problem it also fixed that too. The back seats are removable but I found that by just folding the third row forward it more than doubles the rear cargo area and I still have the extra seating if I need it. I used to own a Pontiac Montana and it was a constant pain. Considering this is the same model and engine, the only difference is it was built by Olds. This is the base model so it lacks some of the bells and whistles but it was those same bells and whistles on the Montana that caused so much trouble. Right now the only problem is the power mirror on the drivers side won't go up or down. I set it by hand and now everything is fine.

oldsmobile,silhouette,2002,2002 Olds Minivan, 07/25/2010,100K and no problems,4,"I am the original owner of 2002 old minvian.  I just made it 99,700 miles and decided to sell it and buy a 2008 Chrysler T&C.  I basically had zero problems with the minivan and it was the best vehicle I have ever owned.  On the way home from the Chrysler dealership after purchasing my 2008 T&C with 15,000 it started making brake noise.  Had to replace front/rear pads/rotors and they also replaced the battery.  I know GM takes a lot of grief but in my experience their quality has been very good."
oldsmobile,silhouette,2002,Steve & Becky, 08/26/2004,Lovin my Olds!,4,"This vehicle is the top of the line from what I have seen in minivans, total luxury.  We bought this vehicle used and we did'nt know all the neat extras it had until we got it home, we were just looking for a nice minivan, but got so much more.  Has a great 6-track cd player, electronic sliding doors,(with many different locations inside the car from which to open them), really nice to have when you are carrying baby seats and groceries etc.  Van is nice and roomy, for real people, not just kids.  Overall a great choice for anyone wanting lots of room and luxury."
oldsmobile,silhouette,2002,JKM, 12/19/2003,Nice luxery for the price,5,"This is the first Oldsmobile I 
purchased. It rides and handles well. 
Nice gas mileage. "
oldsmobile,silhouette,2002,scamp, 06/16/2002,Almost There,4,"First off, in terms of absolute value 
the Oldsmobile shines in terms of 
equipment and price.  The ride, drive, 
and function of the van are good, but I 
would enjoy more power under the hood. 
Compared to the other GM vans, the Olds 
to me is the most attractive looking 
package. The Chevrolet for the same 
money seems just plain cheap. 
Disappointing are so-so fit and finish 
of body panels and a minor HVAC 
problem.  If GM could sweat the small 
stuff a bit better - they would be back 
to #1."

Fuse panel doesn't list location, neighter does Haynes manual. Auto leveling system stinks. keeps raising the van till it tops out. Replaced shocks and vacume lines. Only 1 set of shocks made for this turd. I have to disconnect the hose to relieve the pressure. Sensor on fuel tank has quit. Motor on rear window had to be replaced, couldnt close the window. Vehicle is noisy to drive. Very slow to heat up in the winter. Right front turn signal decides when it wants to work, replaced socket already. New front hubs, control arms. 850.00"
oldsmobile,silhouette,2002,Oldsman, 12/16/2008,Great Luxury MiniVan,5,Bought this van from a private owner. It is a nice luxury minivan with lots of neat features. I love the dual power sliding doors and the rear parking sensor. It drives real smooth and it's been great on trips. I have the van regularly serviced and change the oil every 5000 miles and belts and hoses every 2 years. This van has been very reliable for me. I guess I'll have to look at the Buick or Chevy version when I go to replace it.
oldsmobile,silhouette,2002,Childs Van, 02/10/2009,Solid Family Hauler,4,"Weve been very happy with this van.  For a family of four plus a dog, we have always had enough room for our stuff  even a canoe!  Mechanically, the vehicle has been pretty consistent.  Only major repair was a transmission rebuild at 60,000 miles that was covered under warranty.  Now at 80,000 miles, she burns a little oil, but otherwise runs great and considered reliable.  Recent 700 mile trips have proved uneventful. The interior has held up very well, the DVD and audio is still great.  Well plan to keep our Happy Van for another 2-3 years for those high- capacity needs and five-plus passenger shuttles. "
oldsmobile,silhouette,2002,bullet, 05/23/2002,Initially skeptical,5,"Upon purchasing the Olds I began to get 
sweaty palms thinking that I was going 
to have quality problems. Most reviews 
had the Honda or Chrysler as the van to 
purchase and also the common public 
opinion that Japanese imports are made 
better.  However I just liked the look 
and ride of the Olds.  And I have not 
been dissappointed in anyway.  This van 
has been a superior vehicle in everyway."

I looked aaround for 6 mo.s to replace 
my trusty 1990 SILHOUETTE (bought used 
in 94 for doing conventions), which I 
absolutley loved.  Traded at 181,000

It is spacious and fun to drive.  The entertainment package keeps the kids occupied on long trips.  I would recommend this vehicle to family who needs room and family mobility with out sacrificing the higher end comforts. Leather a plus for cleaning up after kids!!

tightening body moulding."
oldsmobile,silhouette,2002,Angie, 03/03/2010,Very Unreliable!,2,"We had continuous repairs that had to be done. Air compressor leaked causing no airconditioner-$3k for repairs. Rear lights always went out having to replace the fuses constantly. Front lights did not seal well even after replacing the covers so we had to replace headlights monthly alot. Sliding doors opened on their own even with vehicle turned off. Engine blew at 90k miles-$6k. Roters and wheel barrings replaced 3 times. Traction system repaired, Cd player jams when changing Cd's, constant electronic malfunctions. In an accident the van at 40mpg rolled when it hit the ditch, both sliding doors popped open during roll and all the windows busted out- extremely unsafe. Very unreliable vehicle!"
oldsmobile,silhouette,2002,Moe, 09/06/2008,Timely Demise,3,"The van is now showing its age with having to replace the front wheel hub assemblies on both sides (very expensive). The wiring to the hubs has corroded and therefore had to be replaced (costly). The interior is flooding due to improper drainage of condensation of the A/C unit. The power of the engine is very limited compared to the imports. Have also had to replace the rear wiper motor, contacts to the power sliding doors, rear window motors. The headlight assemblies both leak considerably, causing the halogen lamps to need replacing more than necessary."
oldsmobile,silhouette,2002,dickw1, 03/11/2006,Built in problems,4,"Ou Oldsmobile Silhouette Premiere had 10,400 miles on it when we purchased it, but at 30,000 things started to fail. First the AC condenser leaked freon, then had to have rear brakes replaced owing to the shop said was a rock between the pad and rotor (not a warrantee item). Last, the head gaskets started to leak at less than 39,000 miles (a $1,700 job). After 50 plus years as a GM owner, things are going wrong that I never experienced with other cars. I am losing faith in the GM brand, owing, chiefly, to GM refusing to quit using the same cheap gaskets for the last 10- 12 years that I am aware of."
oldsmobile,silhouette,2002,Mike, 03/11/2006,Never a GM product again,3,"We were quite fortunate we bought this during a promoton where GM was selling it with 60,000 mile, 60 month warrantries. We used it. The seat warmers constantly failed. One of the power slide doors failed. The rear tail lights constantly burned out, and GM refuses to admit a flaw. Even the DVD remote is a disappointment ... it is constantly running down the battery. We know have plenty of batteries and a screw driver to deal with this."
oldsmobile,silhouette,2002,Frank, 03/23/2005,No more GM's,2,"I bought this vehicle new in 2002.  It had a sticker price of over $35,000.  I now have 50,000 miles and can't wait to unload it.  The vehicle has AWD and is a nice looking van but it has one flaw. It's a GM!  I have had to replace the wheel bearings twice, the heater in the front sear twice and now the rear gasket needs replaced at a cost of $900.  GM of course is not willing to assist in the repair even though there are only 50,000 miles.  I have a 1997 Dodge Caravan with 105,000 miles and it never needed any repairs other than normal maintenance.  I am getting it repaired and then trading it in on anything other than a GM.  I would not recommend a GM and I will never ever buy one again."
oldsmobile,silhouette,2002,Skip, 01/19/2008,Don't Bother,1,"With 2 young children, thought we HAD to have a minivan. Shouldn't have been this one. Heated seats gave up within first 3 months. Fan control resistor at 5 months. A/C condenser cracked at 70K miles. Intake gasket started leaking at 80K. Poor build quality, and the noisiest highway vehicle I've driven since my '76 K5 Blazer."

Then recently the intake manifold gasket failed and almost destroyed the engine.  GM has known about these bad gaskets for years and told no one.  The service department secretary diagnosed my problem as soon as I walked in.  The recall for the 3.4L engine would cost more than GM has in the bank, that's why they won't do it.

* Great fuel milage yet power is enough 
to spin the wheels even on dry pavement
* Transmission is strong, smooth, great 
shifting and reliable - not like 
Chrysler or Honda with problems.
* Handling with 16"" michelins very good
* Self-leveling suspension nice touch!

The driver's seat needs to go. 
A ""jackhammer"" noise from the engine compartment sounds after warmup on occasion with the heating defroster (front) turned on. Did this like clockwork from new to time of recent service. Took it to dealer (they insist they did nothing to ""fix"" the problem) problem went away after they had it in the shop for 6 hours. I wonder if they get Factory points to avoid claims that can lead to lemon law claims? Hmmm.
Center Console not being standard is a real ""RIP-OFF"".

At 185,000, I can say it has never not started, even though we live in the Midwest with harsh winters and it's not always garage-kept.  It only died one time when the alternator went out at 175,000 miles, and I had a full day's warning with the battery light flashing, so I was pulling into the driveway when it died. The interior is very comfortable and well-designed.  It has very low highway noise.  I trust it and would definitely buy another one."

oldsmobile,silhouette,2003,KENLINDO, 09/18/2004,"GREAT CAR, BUT NOT COOL",4,"GETS GREAT GAS MILEAGE AND HAS NEVER 
HAD ANY PROBLEMS AT ALL.  "
oldsmobile,silhouette,2003,Carol P, 10/28/2004,Works like a Truck,4,"I love my van..didn't think I would 
but I do...It's 'the' car when a group 
of us go out to dinner so we can all 
be together...and (with the rear seat 
out) it hauls anything I need it to 
from furniture to my 2 golden 
retreivers...and 10 feet of pvc pipe 
too!"
oldsmobile,silhouette,2003,Weller, 06/06/2005,A great choice,4,"Very enjoyable to own and drive with around town mileage around 22 to 23 mpg, equal to or better than what we got with our previoys Oldsmobile LS sedan. Over the road we get about 28 to 29 mpg, about 2 mpg less than with our previous olds LS sedan, a 1997 model.  We hope GM continues to produce this kind of a car for our next purchase with equal or hopefully even better gas economy!  "
oldsmobile,silhouette,2003,Sandra Huffman, 11/01/2007,A Great Mini Van,5,"The Silhouette Mini Van has served us well. It has been great on vacation's and every day driving. It is very comfortable and roomy. Enough room for all my family, plus grandkid's. We just love it. We bought the van new. We get good gas mileage and it handles well. I definitely would recommend it , if you can find one, as they are no longer being built."
oldsmobile,silhouette,2003,Don W, 05/16/2003,Love it,5,"This is my 2nd minivan purchase.  This 
one is very different from my previous 
van-Windstar. It drives like a car not 
like a van.  I hated driving a van 
until we purchased the Silhouette.  
The comfort & spacious interior are 
2nd to none."
oldsmobile,silhouette,2003,Fred Hegner, 02/07/2003,My favorite mini van,5,"This is the second Olds mini van we 
have owned. The first was a 1990 which 
was given to our son when it reached 
135,000. By the way the 1990 now has 
about 150,000 and is still going 
strong. The 2002 has been improved in 
every way except the body pannels are 
not as ding or dent proof as were the 
plastic pannels on the 1990. The All 
Wheel Drive feature has proven to be 
worth the extra cost especially this 
winter."
oldsmobile,silhouette,2004,stacyo330, 05/31/2009,Used Silhouette,4,"I bought this minivan with 59,600 miles on it.  It looks like it just came off the showroom floor.  I was impressed with the thoughtful ergonomics and comfortable seating and vantage point.  My wife and I test drove a Chrysler Town & Country and both felt we had a better command of the road visually in the Silhouette.  It also didn't rock side to side as much as the T&C.  I have the premier gold edition, it's like my Dad's Cadillac Deville in a minivan.  I would recommend this vehicle to anyone.  The storage is awesome, power side doors, auxillary air inflator are you kidding me! GM should have tossed out Pontiac first, and kept making this gem."
oldsmobile,silhouette,2004,ataur, 08/23/2008,The people mover,3,"I bought this van for business purposes, because of it's design.  The ride is fantastic and comfort is at par with some of the major luxury brands, it isn't known as ""the Cadillac of Minivans"" for no reason.  Americans can never get their computer systems right, and that became apparent when the ABS, Traction control systems failed.  I don't have time to go to dealership to fix it, and even if I took it to the dealership, these sound like expensive repairs.  Will just have to buy a new vehicle soon.  Great for traveling in, highly recommend this car, if you go on a lot of trips, good gas mileage on the highway, horrible in city."
oldsmobile,silhouette,2004,EILEEN, 09/15/2004,The best mini van on the road,4,"I have had many Olds Silhouette's.  
They are the best mini vans around.  I 
keep hoping that they will continue to 
be produced. GM should add the 
Silhouette to another line ie: Cadillac 
Mini Van. WHATEVER JUST KEEP MAKING IT!!
They ride like a car not a truck like 
the other models.  "
oldsmobile,silhouette,2004,Chad, 04/17/2008,This van has been awesome!!,4,"My wife and I purchased this van new in Jan 2004 and have had it 4+ years now and it has 83,000 miles.  All that we have had to do is replace the wheel bearing and brakes.  For a van which was supposedly unreliable, my wife and I have had no problems. We have taken it on every vacation and it avg's 24- 25 mpg at 70-75 mph with full loads and 3 kids.  It still sparkles when washed and waxed. Lots of room and plenty of room to store luggage when traveling. The interior is easy to clean and seats are very comfy even in back. Lots of storage compartments for those carry along toys.  Sorry to see Olds no longer is in business because we'd buy another."
oldsmobile,silhouette,2004,Carolynn, 12/27/2003,Transmission Troubles,2,"We picked up our Silhouette, drove it 
for about a week before we left for 
Florida where we spend the winter. We 
made it as far as Gainesville and the 
check engine light came on, the gas 
mileage decreased and the performance 
in traffic decreased dramatically. We 
were reasonably close to our 
destination so we continued on. Thank 
Heaven we didn't stop to have it 
checked as we took it in to the dealer 
in Bradenton on our arrival and it took 
11 days to get it back. The 
transmission was out. We were told it 
took that long because the transmission 
never goes out. DUH! We have it back 
but are getting 20 MPG compared to 29 
MPG before the transmission quit."

oldsmobile,silhouette,2004,vinesman, 01/24/2004,Loser,2,"We had high hopes for our Premiere, 
having had GM pull us out of our 
former Chevy Venture lease. It has 
been a reliability nightmare. The 
ventilation system does not deliver 
the same temp of air between the front 
and back (almost 25 degree diff). GM 
master techs cannot correct it. The 
alternator has died four times, and 
still the vehicle has issues. We also 
have a 2 inch pile of service invoices 
for over two dozen nickel and dime 
repairs. At first, we thought we had 
the perfect minivan loaded at the 
right price. Buyer beware - Olds' 
phaseout plays appears to be impacting 
quality. Bottom line - look elsewhere."
oldsmobile,silhouette,2004,Hoffmann, 06/12/2004,Sorry It Is Discontinued,5,"Our 2004 Oldsmobile Silhouete is our 
fifth one.  We have always loved it.  
We have taken previous models on cross 
county trips with elderly parents in 
their mid 80's.  With the second row 
captain's sets, not one of us ever 
suffered a backache.  The long-trip 
mileage is actually very good for a 
vehicle this size, fully loaded with 
passengers,luggage and the air 
conditioning running -- over 27 mpg."

will. I love this van and i would buy 
anthor modle as soon as Oldsmobille 
comes out with one.      "

the power sliding door switch. Had a

another brand out of production. "

Smooth ride and lots of comfort.  They 
do seem to be getting smaller tho.  
Second Olds van that we have had. "

broke down twice during a two year 
period. Its not very reliable and is 
bad. It wasn't very safe when i got 
into a car accident because it killed 
my cousin that was in the front right 
passenger seat."
